a modern ui wrapper for arXiv that i built because i got bored of the default interface and have been using arxiv a lot recently for research. wanted something cleaner and more enjoyable to browse papers with.

## what it does

- presents arxiv papers in a clean, card-based ui
- includes an integrated pdf viewer with dark mode
- organizes papers by category with visual tags
- responsive design that works on desktop and mobile

## what's coming

- ai-generated summaries of papers/highlights (because who reads the whole thing)
- social features to share and discuss papers with others
- better search and filtering options [X]
- personal library to save papers across sessions
- more categories to be supported [X]
- auth and db integration
- recommendation algo for your favourite categories
- MORE SCRAPING!!!!! (thank you arXiv for making your API publicly accessible i promise to use it responsibly :>)
- 

## technical stuff

built with react, typescript, and chakra ui. uses the arxiv api to fetch papers and react-pdf-viewer for pdf rendering. currently deployed on Vercel
uses Github actions to scrape and update repository of arXiv papers.
