# glanxiv

a modern ui wrapper for arxiv that i built because i got bored of the default interface and have been using arxiv a lot recently for research. wanted something cleaner and more enjoyable to browse papers with.

## what it does

- presents arxiv papers in a clean, card-based ui
- includes an integrated pdf viewer with dark mode
- organizes papers by category with visual tags
- responsive design that works on desktop and mobile

## what's coming

- ai-generated summaries of papers (because who reads the whole thing)
- social features to share and discuss papers with others
- better search and filtering options
- personal library to save papers across sessions

## why the name

it's a mix of "glance" and "arxiv" - because sometimes you just want to quickly browse research papers without the visual noise.

## technical stuff

built with react, typescript, and chakra ui. uses the arxiv api to fetch papers and react-pdf-viewer for pdf rendering.
