    "abstract": "The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered\nby the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive\nevaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading\nclosed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M\nand PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).\nFLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality\nFLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)\ndescriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are\norganized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text\nrendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation\nChain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation\nsteps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the\ncommunity with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial\nlabs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct\ntracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through\ncarefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for\nnuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image\naesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench\nreveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring\nimprovement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to\ncatalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation. Project page:\nhttps://flux-reason-6m.github.io/ .",

    "abstract": "Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting\ndeployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower\nnumerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic\nperformance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as\nQuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before\nquantization, using computational invariance: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{Wx} =\n(\\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\\mathbf{Q}$. However, these\nmethods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case\ncoherence $\\mu = 1/\\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight\ndistributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct\noutlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than\none-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces\nHadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by\ncontinuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\\{+1, -1\\}$\nentries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,\nbutterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization\nwhile guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint\nensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \\log\nn)$ computational complexity with only $\\frac{n \\log n}{2}$ learnable\nparameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on\npost-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to\nquantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in\nminutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit\nquantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.",

    "abstract": "The reionization optical depth $\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ has interesting connections\nto existing cosmological anomalies. As first studied in the context of the\nHubble tension in our previous paper, a larger $\\tau_{\\rm reio}$, which could\nbe achieved by removing the Planck low-$\\ell$ polarization data, could boost\n$H_0$ slightly, resulting in a mild reduction of the tension between the early-\nand late-universe determinations of $H_0$. It has been shown later that a\nlarger $\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ could also relieve other anomalies including: the\ntension between BAO and CMB data, the neutrino mass tension, and the latest\nDESI plus supernovae data's tension with the standard cosmological constant\nscenario. In this paper, we systematically analyze the correlations between\n$\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ and relevant cosmological parameters in the existing cosmic\nobservation anomalies. In addition to Pearson correlation coefficients\nextracted directly from the covariance matrix, we also study partial\ncorrelation coefficients which measure intrinsic relationships between pairs of\nparameters removing the influence of other parameters. We show that $\\tau_{\\rm\nreio}$ has weak intrinsic correlations with the parameters responsible for the\ntensions and anomalies discussed. The large direct Pearson correlations that\nallow larger $\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ inferences to alleviate the cosmological\ntensions each arise from complicated networks through multiple parameters. As a\nresult, the relationships between $\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ and each anomaly are not\nindependent of each other. We also employ our method of computing correlations\nto clarify the impact of large scale polarization data, and comment also on the\neffects of CMB observations from ACT and SPT.",

    "abstract": "Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing\nreturns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can\ncomplete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact\nthat marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential\nimprovements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,\nwe argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from\nmistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating\nexecution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to\nsolve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute\nsignificantly more turns even when small models have 100\\% single-turn\naccuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the\nnumber of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --\ncuriously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely\nto make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.\nSelf-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,\nrecent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer\ntasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on\nthe length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on\nthe ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve\ncomplex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and\nhighlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time\ncompute for long-horizon tasks.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful\nparadigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by\nlarge-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two\nfundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale\nhuman-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited\ngeneralization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in\nLarge Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can\ndramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural\nquestion: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action\nplanning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL\nframework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce\nVLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment\nrendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,\nSimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\\pi_0$\non RoboTwin 1.0\\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.\nSimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust\ngeneralization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.\nMoreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,\nwherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in\nthe previous training process.

Both signals serve as an exploration bonus\nwithin the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows\nthat the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and\npromotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the\ncritic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.\nEmpirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over\nstandard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks.

However, diffusion using this optimal\ndenoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to\ncapture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to\ncharacterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,\nproposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that\nresemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method\nhypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of\nconvolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence\nincorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we\npresent evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a\nstatistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of\nconvolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal\nparametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep\nneural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that\nthis locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural\nimage datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser\nthat better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior\nexpert-crafted alternative.",

Strong symmetries can be spontaneously broken down to\nweak ones, a mechanism referred to as Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry\nBreaking (SW-SSB). In this work, we first show that maximally mixed symmetric\ndensity matrices, which appear, for example, as steady states of symmetric\nrandom quantum circuits have SW-SSB when the symmetry is an on-site\nrepresentation of a compact Lie or finite group. We then show that this can be\nregarded as an isolated point within an entire SW-SSB phase that is stable to\nmore general quantum operations such as measurements followed by weak\npostselection. With sufficiently strong postselection, a second-order\ntransition can be driven to a phase where the steady state is strongly\nsymmetric. We provide analytical and numerical results for such SW-SSB phases\nand their transitions for both abelian $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and non-abelian $S_3$\nsymmetries in the steady state of Brownian random quantum circuits with\nmeasurements. We also show that such continuous SW-SSB transitions are absent\nin the steady-state of general strongly symmetric, trace-preserving quantum\nchannels (including unital, Brownian, or Lindbladian dynamics) by analyzing the\ndegeneracies of the steady states in the presence of symmetries.

Our framework is\nrigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of\njoint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,\nrespecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:\n(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of\nplausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to \"roll out\"\nrealistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation.

Using\nreconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the\ncoherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and\ngeneration processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,\na novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the\ndecoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained\nsemantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via\nreinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase\nto gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction\nloss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to\ngenerate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction\nquality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,\nwhere the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to\nleverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and\ngeneration fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first\nbenchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A\nsurprising \"aha moment\" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL\nprogresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while\nthe decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these\nintricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.",

In this paper, on mental\nmath tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without\nexplicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting\ninput-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes\nof information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and\nforcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.\nWith two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and\nAttention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with\nhigh accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful\ncomputation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last\ntoken, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle\nlayers.

This paper investigates how the appearance\nof AI assistance affects our perceptions of message senders. Adding nuance to\nprevious research, through two studies (N=399) featuring vignette scenarios, we\nfind that AI-assistance labels don't necessarily make people view senders\nnegatively. Rather, they dampen the strength of character signals in\ncommunication. We show that when someone sends a warmth-signalling message\n(like thanking or apologizing) without AI help, people more strongly categorize\nthe sender as warm. At the same time, when someone sends a coldness-signalling\nmessage (like bragging or blaming) without assistance, people more confidently\ncategorize them as cold. Interestingly, AI labels weaken both these\nassociations: An AI-assisted apology makes the sender appear less warm than if\nthey had written it themselves, and an AI-assisted blame makes the sender\nappear less cold than if they had composed it independently. This supports our\nsignal diagnosticity explanation: messages labeled as AI-assisted are viewed as\nless diagnostic than messages which seem unassisted.

    "abstract": "Despite their importance, the dynamical properties of massive stars remain\npoorly understood. Rotation is a key driver of internal mixing and angular\nmomentum transport, significantly influencing massive star evolution. However,\nconstraining rotation from spectroscopy is challenging, as spectral lines often\nexhibit excess broadening beyond rotation. The origin of this additional\nbroadening, typically attributed to large-scale velocity fields and commonly\nreferred to as macroturbulence, remains uncertain and unconstrained. Here, we\npresent the combined analysis of TESS photometry and rapid time-series\nspectroscopy using the high-resolution ESPRESSO instrument at the Very Large\nTelescope of the European Southern Observatory for the rapidly rotating and\npulsating massive star Zeta Ophiuchi. Leveraging excellent temporal coverage,\nour analysis demonstrates that pulsation-induced variability leads to\npeak-to-peak scatter as large as 88 km/s in the observed macroturbulent\nvelocity time series. We also demonstrate that time-averaged macroturbulent\nvelocities are spectral line specific and can exceed 100 km/s . Furthermore,\nthe macroturbulent velocities from shorter integration times are systematically\nlower than those derived from stacked spectra mimicking longer exposure times\ntypically needed for fainter stars. These results highlight the role of\npulsations in driving variable macroturbulence in massive stars, while also\npointing to a potential bias in spectroscopic estimates of macroturbulence for\nfainter massive stars.",

    "abstract": "A $k$-net($n$) is a combinatorial design equivalent to $k-2$ mutually\northogonal Latin squares of order $n$. A relation in a net is a linear\ndependency over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ in the incidence matrix of the net. A\ncomputational enumeration of all orthogonal pairs of Latin squares of order 10\nwhose corresponding nets have at least two nontrivial relations was achieved by\nDelisle in 2010 and verified by an independent search of Myrvold. In this\npaper, we confirm the correctness of their exhaustive enumerations with a\nsatisfiability (SAT) solver approach instead of using custom-written\nbacktracking code. Performing the enumeration using a SAT solver has at least\nthree advantages. First, it reduces the amount of trust necessary, as SAT\nsolvers produce independently-verifiable certificates that their enumerations\nare complete. These certificates can be checked by formal proof verifiers that\nare relatively simple pieces of software, and therefore easier to trust.\nSecond, it is typically more straightforward and less error-prone to use a SAT\nsolver over writing search code. Third, it can be more efficient to use a\nSAT-based approach, as SAT solvers are highly optimized pieces of software\nincorporating backtracking-with-learning for improving the efficiency of the\nbacktracking search. For example, the SAT solver completely enumerates all\northogonal pairs of Latin squares of order ten with two nontrivial relations in\nunder 2 hours on a desktop machine, while Delisle's 2010 search used 11,700 CPU\nhours. Although computer hardware was slower in 2010, this alone cannot explain\nthe improvement in the efficiency of our SAT-based search.",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) aims to synthesize high-quality speech that\nmimics the voice of an unseen speaker using only a short reference sample,\nrequiring not only speaker adaptation but also accurate modeling of prosodic\nattributes. Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow\nmatching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from\nslow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have\nbeen widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to\nexplore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential\nof discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing\nflow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous\nspace and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the\nadvantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model\nto explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS\nexplicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified\narchitecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual\ncontent, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference\nspeech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In\naddition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with\ndistinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn\naspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS\nachieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness,\nprosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control. It also maintains a\ncompact model size and achieves low-latency inference, generating speech up to\n25.8 times faster than the latest existing baselines.",

To address the infinite hyperparameter space of\nthe classifier, we mathematically derive a cosine-wise diffusion process to\nefficiently search optimal hyperparameters. Extensive experiments conducted on\nthree large real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartDetector outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods by an average improvement of 14.01% in\nF1-score, achieving an overall average F1-score of 95.88%.",

Using 30 winters (1993--2022) of daily OISST and\nERA5 fields, we combine multivariate Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA) with an\nOrnstein--Uhlenbeck (OU)-like integration of atmospheric principal components\n(PCs). The leading coupled mode explains 87% (+AO) and 75% (-AO) of squared\ncovariance, with SSTA hot spots in East Korea Bay and along the subpolar front.\nZero-lag correlations between the SSTA PC and OU-integrated atmospheric PCs\nreveal characteristic memory timescales ($\\tau$) of $\\sim$18--25 days for\nwind-stress curl (CurlTau), $\\sim$15--30 days for near-surface air temperature\n(ATMP) and zonal winds, and $\\sim$30--50 days for sea-level pressure (SLP) and\nmeridional winds -- longer under -AO. Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)\nshows SSTA persistence $H \\approx 1.3$--$1.4$ and that integrated atmospheric\nresponses acquire ocean-like persistence, validating Hasselmann's stochastic\nframework for winter EJS.

We\ninvestigate the quenching of centrals, high-mass satellites, and low-mass\nsatellites from two cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: IllustrisTNG and\nEAGLE. Satellites are split according to bespoke mass thresholds, designed to\nseparate environmental and intrinsic quenching mechanisms. To determine the\nbest parameter for predicting quiescence, we apply a Random Forest\nclassification analysis for each galaxy class at each epoch. The Random Forest\nclassification determines supermassive black hole mass as the best predictor of\nquiescence in centrals and high-mass satellites. Alternatively, the quenching\nof low-mass satellites is best predicted by group halo mass, at all epochs.\nAdditionally, we investigate the evolution in the dependence of the quenched\nfraction with various parameters, revealing a more complex picture. There is\nstrong evidence for the rejuvenation of star formation from z = 2 to z = 0 in\nEAGLE, but not in IllustrisTNG. The starkest discrepancy between simulations\nrests in the mass threshold analysis.

The formalism also ignores the implications of long range\n(magnetic dipole type) $1/r^4$ interaction between the small instantons, since\nit is weaker than Coulomb interaction. We show that in $U(1)$ lattice gauge\ntheory, where finite action configurations are monopole loops, small loops at\nlarge separations also interact with the same type of $1/r^4$ interaction. If\none ignores the classical interactions between monopoles, following the same\nidea as in Yang-Mills theory, the one-monopole partition function is also\ninfrared divergent at strong coupling. However, $1/r^4$ interactions among\nsmall loops should be viewed as a consequence of multipole expansion, and\nemanate from $1/r^2$ interaction between current segments. Taking interactions\ninto account, one can prove that the strongly coupled $U(1)$ lattice gauge\ntheory is dual to a lattice abelian Higgs model, and more importantly, free of\ninfrared divergences. The model exhibits mass gap and confinement by monopole\ncondensation. We suggest that the structure of moduli space of instantons, ADHM\ndata, and the long ranged classical interactions in pure Yang-Mills theory\nshould be examined with this refined perspective.

Half of the\nposts did not receive comments from peers or physicians. At least 90% of the\npeople disclose their gender and age, and 80% of the people do not disclose\ntheir race. It was observed that the subreddit is dominated by adult (age group\n20-39) white males. Some disparities were observed in the engagement between\nthe users and the posters with certain demographics. Beyond the confines of\nclinics and hospitals, social media could bring patients and providers closer\ntogether, however, as observed, current physicians participation is low\ncompared to posters.",

Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those\ncurated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large\nmolecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR\nframework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging\npre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the\nproposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of\nmolecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical\nchemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and\npharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability. Crucially, the\nmodel's representations are intrinsically aligned with established chemical\nprinciples, allowing chemists to directly link predicted properties to specific\nfunctional groups and facilitating novel insights into structure-property\nrelationships.

In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel methodology to explain concept drift by\nanalyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations\n(GCEs). Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their\nassociated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift.

We operationalize\nthis analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines\ninsights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer\n(prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer.

We developed a mobile robot called \"MOFU (Morphing Fluffy\nUnit),\" capable of whole-body expansion-contraction with a single motor and\ncovered with a fluffy exterior. MOFU employs a \"Jitterbug\" structure, a\ngeometric transformation mechanism that enables smooth volume change in\ndiameter from 210 to 280 mm using one actuator. It is also equipped with a\ndifferential two-wheel drive mechanism for locomotion.

Exploratory analyses further compared four dual-robot motion\nconditions. Third, when expansion-contraction was combined with locomotion,\nanimacy ratings were higher than locomotion alone.

This functional form allows for a more physically\nconsistent and mathematically tractable representation of gas loss compared to\nconventional constant-rate or stepwise models.

    "abstract": "Some of the most puzzling discoveries of NASA's JWST in the early Universe\nsurround the surprising abundance of compact red sources, which show peculiar\ncontinuum shapes and broad hydrogen spectral lines. These sources, dubbed\n``Little Red Dots'' or LRDs, have been the subject of intense inquiry in the\nliterature. Any of the proposed explanations, from accreting super-massive\nblack holes ensconced in ultra-dense gas to extremely compact star-systems, has\nsignificant implications for the earliest phases of galaxy evolution. Part of\nthe difficulty in concretely identifying the physical mechanisms that drive\ntheir rest ultra-violet/optical spectral properties is the lack of bona fide\nsignatures -- either star-formation or accreting super-massive black hole, that\nuniquely discriminate between competing interpretations. In this work, we\nreport the discovery of several spectral features that strongly favor the\nexistence of an accreting super-massive black hole in an LRD witnessed in the\nfirst 800 Myr of cosmic time, including several rare iron transitions and a\npossible [FeVII]. Additionally, we report on the properties of significant\nBalmer absorption and find that the small widths and relative depths of the\nabsorption feature suggest the source of the absorber is at or beyond the outer\nedge of the broad-line region and does it fully cover the accreting SMBH in the\ncenter of the system. The detection of these iron features, coupled with the\nproperties of the Balmer absorption, unveils an alternative scenario for LRDs\n-- one where there are direct sight-lines from the accretion disk to gas on\nscales at (or beyond) the broad-line gas region.",

To address these challenges, we propose a UNet-based deep\nlearning architecture that combines multi-scale feature extraction,\nconvolution-based feature fusion, and an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP)\nbottleneck for efficient context aggregation. The model predicts pathloss maps\nfrom log-distance, line-of-sight (LOS) mask, and building mask inputs.

Optical,\nradio, and gamma-ray observations confirmed its nature as a compact spider\nbinary system. Optical photometry from ULTRACAM revealed a \\(\\sim\\)2.7-hour\norbital period, guiding MeerKAT observations that detected \\(\\sim\\)2.4-ms radio\npulsations. Subsequent timing campaigns using the Murriyang Parkes Telescope,\nthe Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope, and the Nan\\c{c}ay Radio Telescope\nallowed us to obtain a preliminary timing solution, which enabled us to find\ngamma-ray pulsations. The final timing solution, spanning 16 years of Fermi-LAT\ngamma-ray data, also displays orbital period variations typical of spider\npulsars. X-ray observations from eROSITA indicate non-thermal emission, but the\nrelatively low count rate prohibits the search for X-ray pulsations. Optical\nlight curve modelling using Icarus suggests the asymmetry is best explained by\na spot model, where uneven heating creates localised temperature variations on\nthe companion. While the optical spectra we obtained are compatible with the\nphysical properties we infer for the companion star, they were not of\nsufficient signal-to-noise to allow for radial velocity measurements, thus\nlimiting constraints on the neutron star's mass. The observed bluer colour near\nthe light curve minimum suggests possible non-thermal emission from\nintra-binary shocks, supported by the presence of an X-ray source. This\ndiscovery exemplifies the proven capability of the Fermi-LAT catalogue in\nidentifying millisecond pulsar candidates and highlights the role of optical\nsurveys in detecting variable sources suitable for radio follow-up.",

Spacetime codes have emerged as a\nnatural framework to understand error correction at the circuit level while\nleveraging the traditional QEC toolbox. Here, we introduce a framework based on\nchain complexes and chain maps to model spacetime codes and transformations\nbetween them. We show that stabilizer codes, quantum circuits, and decoding\nproblems can all be described using chain complexes, and that the equivalence\nof two spacetime codes can be characterized by specific maps between chain\ncomplexes, the fault-tolerant maps, that preserve the number of encoded qubits,\nfault distance, and minimum-weight decoding problem. As an application of this\nframework, we extend the foliated cluster state construction from stabilizer\ncodes to any spacetime code, showing that any Clifford circuit can be\ntransformed into a measurement-based protocol with the same fault-tolerant\nproperties. To this protocol, we associate a chain complex which encodes the\nunderlying decoding problem, generalizing previous cluster state complex\nconstructions. Our method enables the construction of cluster states from\nnon-CSS, subsystem, and Floquet codes, as well as from logical Clifford\noperations on a given code.",

This\nlimitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that\nunifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait\ngeneration. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we\ndesign a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a\nblueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing\nhigh-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second\nstage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in\nparallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework\npreserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent\nbehind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and\nstable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world\napplications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging.

    "abstract": "Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has\nrecently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional\nsensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an \"image-relative\"\napproach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and\nsubgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have\nlimitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and\nembodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an\nembodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we\npresent a new paradigm of learning \"object-relative\" control that exhibits\nseveral desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without\nstrictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction\nproblem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high\ninvariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across\nboth training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric\nmap representation in the form of a \"relative\" 3D scene graph, which is used to\nobtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a\nlocal controller, dubbed \"ObjectReact\", conditioned directly on a high-level\n\"WayObject Costmap\" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB\ninput. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over\nits image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple\nnavigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding\ncapability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We\nfurther show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world\nindoor environments.

To\naddress this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit\ncommunities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our\ncomprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and\ndecomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories,\nenabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under\nvarious prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align\nwith human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis\nfurther shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with\nestablished emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture\ncontextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings\nhighlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer\ninsights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding.",

As attackers focus on devising new tactics to bypass existing\ndetection solutions, researchers have adapted by integrating machine learning\nand deep learning into phishing detection. Phishing dataset collection is vital\nto developing effective phishing detection approaches, which highly depend on\nthe diversity of the gathered datasets. The lack of diversity in the dataset\nresults in a biased model. Since phishing websites are often short-lived,\ncollecting them is also a challenge. Consequently, very few phishing webpage\ndataset repositories exist to date. No single repository comprehensively\nconsolidates all phishing elements corresponding to a phishing webpage, namely,\nURL, webpage source code, screenshot, and related webpage resources. This paper\nintroduces a resource collection tool designed to gather various resources\nassociated with a URL, such as CSS, Javascript, favicons, webpage images, and\nscreenshots. Our tool leverages PhishTank as the primary source for obtaining\nactive phishing URLs. Our tool fetches several additional webpage resources\ncompared to PyWebCopy Python library, which provides webpage content for a\ngiven URL. Additionally, we share a sample dataset generated using our tool\ncomprising 4,056 legitimate and 5,666 phishing URLs along with their associated\nresources. We also remark on the top correlated phishing features with their\nassociated class label found in our dataset. Our tool offers a comprehensive\nresource set that can aid researchers in developing effective phishing\ndetection approaches.",

    "abstract": "The bluff nature of a freight train locomotive, coupled with large gaps\ncreated between different wagon formations and loaded goods, influence the\noverall pressure wave pattern generated as the train passes through a tunnel.\nTypically, 1D models are used to predict the patterns and properties of tunnel\npressure wave formations. However, accurate modelling of regions of separation\nat the head of the blunted containers and at unloaded gap sections is essential\nfor precise predictions of pressure magnitudes. This has traditionally been\ndifficult to capture with 1D models. Furthermore, achieving this accuracy\nthrough 3D computational methods demands exceptional mesh quality, significant\ncomputational resources, and the careful selection of numerical models. This\npaper evaluates various numerical models to capture these complexities within\nregions of flow separation. Findings have supported the development of a new 1D\nprogramme to calculate the pressure wave generated by a freight locomotive\nentering a tunnel, and is here further extended to consider the discontinuities\nof the train body created by intermodal container loading patterns, by\nimplementing new mesh system and boundary conditions into the 1D programme. A\nparameterisation study for different loading configurations is also presented\nto improve the overall programme adaptability, and the relationship between\npredetermined parameters and gap length is investigated. We validate the\neffectiveness of the improved 1D model through comprehensive Large Eddy\nSimulation (LES) results and conduct an extensive parameterisation study to\nenhance its applicability across various loading configurations. Consequently,\nthis research bridges the gap in freight train tunnel aerodynamics, offering a\nversatile 1D numerical tool for accurate pressure wave prediction.",

In this study, we discuss the\npossibility that this neutrino is cosmogenic, i. e., produced by ultra-high\nenergy cosmic rays (UHECR) during their propagation through the intergalactic\nmedium. We adopt the UHECR flux models derived by the Telescope Array\nexperiment, which features a predominantly light mass composition. We show that\nthe predictions of the cosmogenic neutrino flux in these models are consistent\nwith the measurements of the KM3NeT-only and with that of the \"global neutrino\nobservatory\" at approximately 2${\\sigma}$ level. Notably, this result is\nachieved in a minimal version of the UHECR flux models, that assume one source\npopulation with a standard cosmological evolution. We also estimate the\ncorresponding cosmogenic gamma-ray flux and show that it is consistent with\nFermi-LAT IGRB measurements and UHE gamma-ray limits; the improvement of the\nlatter can probe these predictions in future.",

This paper introduces Causal PDE-Control\nModels (CPCMs), a unifying framework that integrates causal inference,\nnonlinear filtering, and forward-backward partial differential equations for\ndynamic portfolio optimization. The framework delivers three theoretical\nadvances: (i) the existence of conditional risk-neutral measures under evolving\ninformation sets; (ii) a projection-divergence duality that quantifies the\nstability cost of departing from the causal driver manifold; and (iii) causal\ncompleteness, establishing that a finite driver span can capture all systematic\npremia. Classical methods such as Markowitz, CAPM, and Black-Litterman appear\nas degenerate cases, while reinforcement learning and deep-hedging policies\nemerge as unconstrained, symmetry-breaking approximations. Empirically, CPCM\nsolvers implemented with physics-informed neural networks achieve higher Sharpe\nratios, lower turnover, and more persistent premia than both econometric and\nmachine-learning benchmarks, using a global equity panel with more than 300\ncandidate drivers. By reframing portfolio optimization around structural\ncausality and PDE control, CPCMs provide a rigorous, interpretable, and\ncomputationally tractable foundation for robust asset allocation under\nnonstationary conditions.",

Our system leverages cascaded thin-film\nlithium niobate modulators, a semiconductor optical amplifier, and a digital\nsignal processing (DSP) engine in a recurrent time-encoded loop, demonstrating\npotential $>$200 giga-operations per second for spin coupling and nonlinearity.\nThis platform achieves the largest spin configuration in an OEO-based photonic\nIsing machine, enabled by high intrinsic speed. We experimentally demonstrate\nbest-in-class solution quality for Max-Cut problems of arbitrary graph\ntopologies (2,000 and 20,000 spins) among photonic Ising machines and obtain\nground-state solutions for number partitioning and lattice protein folding -\nbenchmarks previously unaddressed by photonic systems. Our system leverages\ninherent noise from high baud rates to escape local minima and accelerate\nconvergence. Finally, we show that embedding DSP - traditionally used in\noptical communications - within optical computation enhances convergence and\nsolution quality, opening new frontiers in scalable, ultrafast computing for\noptimization, neuromorphic processing, and analog AI.",

All these platforms operate in a\ncentralized way to collect agents' latest observations of new options (e.g.,\nrestaurants, hotels, travel routes) and share such information with all in real\ntime. However, after hearing the central platforms' live updates, many human\nagents are found selfish and unwilling to further explore unknown options for\nthe benefit of others in the long run. To regulate the human-in-the-loop\nlearning (HILL) game against selfish agents' free-riding, this paper proposes a\nparadigm shift from centralized to decentralized way of operation that forces\nagents' local explorations through restricting information sharing. When game\ntheory meets distributed learning, we formulate our decentralized communication\nmechanism's design as a new multi-agent Markov decision process (MA-MDP), and\nderive its analytical condition to outperform today's centralized operation. As\nthe optimal decentralized communication mechanism in MA-MDP is NP-hard to\nsolve, we present an asymptotically optimal algorithm with linear complexity to\ndetermine the mechanism's timing of intermittent information sharing.

At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese\nencoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly\nintegrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training\nonly a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of\nVFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2\n(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is\ncomplemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains\non the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD\n(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and\nLEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong\nsuppression of pseudo-changes.

This setting is\nparticularly relevant when some agents exhibit extreme or atypical preferences.\nAs a natural case study, we consider facility location on the line: $n$\nstrategic agents report their preferred locations, and a mechanism places a\nfacility to minimize a social cost function. In our setting, the $z$ agents\nfarthest from the chosen facility are excluded from the social cost. While it\nmay seem intuitive that discarding outliers improves efficiency, our results\nreveal that the opposite can hold.\n  We derive tight bounds for deterministic strategyproof mechanisms under the\ntwo most-studied objectives: utilitarian and egalitarian social cost. Our\nresults offer a comprehensive view of the impact of outliers. We first show\nthat when $z \\ge n/2$, no strategyproof mechanism can achieve a bounded\napproximation for either objective. For egalitarian cost, selecting the $(z +\n1)$-th order statistic is strategyproof and 2-approximate. In fact, we show\nthat this is best possible by providing a matching lower bound. Notably, this\nlower bound of 2 persists even when the mechanism has access to a prediction of\nthe optimal location, in stark contrast to the setting without outliers. For\nutilitarian cost, we show that strategyproof mechanisms cannot effectively\nexploit outliers, leading to the counterintuitive outcome that approximation\nguarantees worsen as the number of outliers increases. However, in this case,\naccess to a prediction allows us to design a strategyproof mechanism achieving\nthe best possible trade-off between consistency and robustness.

Deep\nlearning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases\nsuch as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans.

When these features are related\nto protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against\nunderrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In\nthis work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias\nin DL based AD diagnosis from MRI.

    "abstract": "Neural Audio Codecs (NACs) have become increasingly adopted in speech\nprocessing tasks due to their excellent rate-distortion performance and\ncompatibility with Large Language Models (LLMs) as discrete feature\nrepresentations for audio generation. While most existing codecs rely on\nResidual Vector Quantization (RVQ), Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has\nrecently emerged as a compelling alternative that simplifies training and\nnatively supports single codebooks. We introduce NeuCodec, an FSQ-based NAC,\nand show that FSQ encodes baked-in redundancy which produces an encoding which\nis robust when transmitted through noisy channels. First, through an encoder\ndistillation experiment, we show that two different encoders can learn to\nencode identical audio into vastly different code sequences whilst maintaining\ncomparable reconstruction quality with the same quantizer and decoder. Second,\nwe demonstrate that FSQ has vastly superior bit-level perturbation robustness\nby comparing the performance of RVQ and FSQ codecs when simulating the\ntransmission of code sequences through a noisy channel.",

    "abstract": "In the traditional Monte Carlo Glauber modeling of relativistic collisions\ninvolving deformed nuclei, the nuclear shape is interpreted classically; that\nis, each nucleus in an event is described by a configuration with fixed\ndeformation parameters and orientation (collective coordinates). However,\nquantum mechanically, a valid ground state must be a superposition, at the\namplitude level, of these deformed configurations to preserve rotational and\nother symmetries. This leads to significant entanglement in the nucleon wave\nfunction. For collisions with a moderate number of participants, we show that\naccounting for this quantum superposition -- particularly in the orientation of\ndeformed nuclei -- can substantially alter the geometric shape of the\nquark-gluon plasma fireball at the early stage of the collision. By modifying\nthe Monte Carlo Glauber model to approximately incorporate these quantum\nsuperposition effects, we find that the second-order eccentricity in Ne-Ne\ncollisions is reduced by approximately $6\\%$ compared to classical treatments\nof nuclear orientation. Even larger impacts are expected for Ne-Pb collisions\nand for symmetric cumulant observables. These results indicate that quantum\nentanglement in nuclear structure plays a measurable role in heavy-ion\ncollisions and should be considered when using such collisions to probe nuclear\ndeformation.",

This study combines\nfirst-principles calculations with data-driven techniques from artificial\nintelligence, specifically principal component analysis (PCA), to reveal trends\nand correlations across multiple structural, magnetic, and electronic\ndescriptors. For each composition, a set of inequivalent atomic configurations\nwas fully optimized. Structurally, the relaxed lattices exhibit anisotropic\nexpansion, with a pronounced elongation of the out-of-plane lattice parameter\n($c$) relative to the in-plane lattice vectors, which promotes the development\nof perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Our results reveal that an out-of-plane\neasy axis emerges at intermediate Ru concentrations (25-28%), while low and\nhigh Ru levels favor an in-plane orientation or even vanishing anisotropy. The\nhalf-metallic character is also modulated by Ru content, appearing selectively\nat both ends of the composition range.

Even in case the metal layer\nhas a matching lattice symmetry and atomic distance, the Si/metal interface is\ndisturbed by the silicide thus preventing epitaxial growth. One exception is\nNiAl which is known to grow epitaxially when deposited on Si(001). During the\ngrowth, NiAl reacts with Si to form NiSi$_2$. In this work, epitaxial NiAl is\ngrown and significant silicidation is observed in accordance with previous\nreports.

Additionally, NiSi$_2$ can be used as a seed layer for the epitaxial\ngrowth of other metals besides NiAl. This was tested by growing NiSi$_2$\nseperately and replacing the NiAl layer with Cr. Growing Cr directly on Si(001)\nproduced a polycrystalline layer. When NiSi$_2$ was used as a seed layer, the\nCr layer was found to be a single crystal with Si(001)//Cr(001) and\nSi(100)//Cr(100).

In particular, when\nthe clients' data do not follow an IID distribution, while other defense\nmechanisms fail, ProDiGy maintains strong defense capabilities and model\naccuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of a dual perspective\napproach that promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting\nsuspicious uniformity as a potential indicator of an attack.",

Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help\npredict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and\nanatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help\npredict its general shape.

    "abstract": "Metaheuristics are widely applied for their ability to provide more efficient\nsolutions. The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based\nmetaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid\nloss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into\nlocal optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address\nthe shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance\nlearning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three\nstrategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning\nstrategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population\ndiversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the\nbootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the\ntendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early\nsearch stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the\nhard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the\nweighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search\nability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is\nproposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the\nstagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus\nenhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed\nMRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test\nset, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the\nFriedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The\nresults show that MRIME-CD can effectively improve the performance of basic\nRIME and has obvious superiorities in terms of solution accuracy, convergence\nspeed and stability.",

Accurate range\nestimation is essential, but planning still relies on X-ray CT, which\nintroduces uncertainty in stopping power and range. Proton CT measures water\nequivalent thickness directly but suffers resolution loss from multiple Coulomb\nscattering. We develop a data driven method that reconstructs water equivalent\npath length (WEPL) maps from energy resolved proton radiographs, bypassing\nintermediate reconstructions. Approach. We present a machine learning pipeline\nfor WEPL from high dimensional radiographs. Data were generated with the TOPAS\nMonte Carlo toolkit, modeling a clinical nozzle and a patient CT. Proton\nenergies spanned 70-230 MeV across 72 projection angles. Principal component\nanalysis reduced input dimensionality while preserving signal. A conditional\nGAN with gradient penalty was trained for WEPL prediction using a composite\nloss (adversarial, MSE, SSIM, perceptual) to balance sharpness, accuracy, and\nstability. Main results. The model reached a mean relative WEPL deviation of\n2.5 percent, an SSIM of 0.97, and a proton radiography gamma index passing rate\nof 97.1 percent (2 percent delta WEPL, 3 mm distance-to-agreement) on a\nsimulated head phantom. Results indicate high spatial fidelity and strong\nstructural agreement. Significance. WEPL can be mapped directly from proton\nradiographs with deep learning while avoiding intermediate steps. The method\nmitigates limits of analytic techniques and may improve treatment planning.\nFuture work will tune the number of PCA components, include detector response,\nexplore low dose settings, and extend multi angle data toward full proton CT\nreconstruction; it is compatible with clinical workflows.",

It argues for their\nrecognition as a distinct regulatory concern. Using India as a case study for\njurisdictions that lack a horizontal AI law, the paper analyzes the country's\nkey digital regulations. The analysis reveals that India's existing legal\ninstruments, including the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the CERT-In Rules, and\nthe Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, focus on cybersecurity and data\nbreaches, creating a significant regulatory gap for AI-specific operational\nincidents, such as performance degradation and algorithmic bias.

Yet,\nintriguing special cases exist in which the output wavefront is \"frozen\"\n(agnostic to the input wavefront). This happens when special structure in the\ncomplex medium collapses the rank of its transmission matrix to unity. Here, we\nunveil that an analogous phenomenon exists more universally for differential\nscattering (including reflection) in reconfigurable complex media.\nSpecifically, for a localized perturbation, the differential scattering matrix\nof any complex medium has rank one. One consequence is that the differential\noutput signal is perfectly coherent irrespective of the input wavefront's\ncoherence. Moreover, the thermal noise emitted into the frozen differential\noutput mode has a particular structure that can be exploited for thermal noise\nmanagement. We experimentally evidence frozen differential scattering in a\nrich-scattering wireless link parametrized by a programmable meta-atom. Then,\nwe demonstrate \"customized freezing\" by optimizing the configuration of\nadditional programmable meta-atoms that parametrize the wireless link, as\nenvisioned for 6G networks.

PLENA also features a novel\nflattened systolic array architecture that has native support for\nFlashAttention to tackle these memory walls in the scenario of inference\nserving for long-context LLMs. Additionally, PLENA is developed with a complete\nstack, including a custom ISA, a compiler, a cycle-emulated simulator, and an\nautomated design space exploration flow. The simulated results show that PLENA\nachieves up to 8.5x higher utilization than existing accelerators, and delivers\n2.24x higher throughput than the A100 GPU and 3.85x higher throughput than the\nTPU v6e, under the same multiplier count and memory settings. The full PLENA\nsystem will also be open-sourced.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel\nand practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga\nline art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this\nproblem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a\nTransformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and\nacross images.

However, these two components are not independent. Global\nmovement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,\ndriven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to\nprecisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,\nwhile deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is\ncomputationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose\nusing whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local\nmotion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of\njoint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a\nphysically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.\nBuilding on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces\nconsistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in\nground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,\nimproves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion.

Recently, neural network-based ILF\nschemes have achieved remarkable coding gains, emerging as a powerful candidate\nfor next-generation video coding standards. However, the use of deep neural\nnetworks (DNN) brings significant computational and time complexity or high\ndemands for dedicated hardware, making it challenging for general use. To\naddress this limitation, we study a practical ILF solution by adopting look-up\ntables (LUTs). After training a DNN with a restricted reference range for ILF,\nall possible inputs are traversed, and the output values of the DNN are cached\ninto LUTs. During the coding process, the filtering process is performed by\nsimply retrieving the filtered pixel through locating the input pixels and\ninterpolating between the cached values, instead of relying on heavy inference\ncomputations. In this paper, we propose a universal LUT-based ILF framework,\ntermed LUT-ILF++. First, we introduce the cooperation of multiple kinds of\nfiltering LUTs and propose a series of customized indexing mechanisms to enable\nbetter filtering reference perception with limited storage consumption. Second,\nwe propose the cross-component indexing mechanism to enable the filtering of\ndifferent color components jointly. Third, in order to make our solution\npractical for coding uses, we propose the LUT compaction scheme to enable the\nLUT pruning, achieving a lower storage cost of the entire solution. The\nproposed framework is implemented in the VVC reference software. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed framework achieves on average 0.82%/2.97%/1.63%\nand 0.85%/4.11%/2.06% bitrate reduction for common test sequences, under the AI\nand RA configurations, respectively.

Observations of such transients are valuable for\nunderstanding and testing models of mass transfer. For donor stars in the\nHertzsprung gap, there can be a long phase of mass-transfer evolution before\ninstability sets in. Only few case studies of such delayed dynamical\ninstability (DDI) mass transfer exist. None consider the full pre-instability\nevolution and the effects thereof on the observable properties of a binary. We\nsystematically analyse detailed models of stable and unstable mass transfer for\nHertzsprung-gap donors. We focus on identifying observable evolutionary\nfeatures characteristic of ultimately unstable mass transfer and not found in\nstable mass-transfer binaries. Our binary evolution models, calculated with the\nMESA code, cover initial donor masses between $2.5 M_{\\odot}$ and $10\nM_{\\odot}$ and initial accretor-to-donor mass ratios between $0.1$ and $1$. We\nfind that the pre-instability evolution is qualitatively the same for all DDI\ndonor stars, consisting of a long slow dimming phase followed by a shorter\nphase of rapid brightening. The latter phase is powered by recombination of\nhydrogen and accompanied by a strong increase in effective temperature, unique\nto unstable mass-transfer binaries. We estimate that a significant fraction of\nthe rapid brighteners should be detectable by Gaia throughout the Galaxy. We\nmodel the progenitors of LRNe M31-2015 and V838 Mon, find a higher initial\ndonor mass for M31 2015 than past estimates, and propose a new scenario for\nV838 Mon in which the known tertiary star dominates the pre-outburst photometry\nand the outburst results from the DDI of a more massive primary star.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the role of initial vorticity packing fractions on\nthe transport properties of decaying incompressible two-dimensional\nNavier-Stokes turbulence at very high Reynolds numbers and spatial resolutions.\nTurbulence is initiated via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and evolves\nthrough nonlinear inverse energy cascades, forming large-scale coherent\nstructures that dominate the flow over long eddy turnover times. The initial\nvorticity packing fraction and circulation direction lead to qualitatively\ndistinct turbulence dynamics and transport behaviors. Tracer particle\ntrajectories are computed in the fluid field obtained using the Eulerian\nframework, with transport and mixing quantified using statistical measures such\nas absolute dispersion, position probability distribution functions (PDFs), and\nvelocity PDFs. In the early stages, the onset of turbulence is primarily\ngoverned by the instability growth rate, which increases with vorticity packing\nfraction. As the flow evolves, transport exhibits a range of\nbehaviors-subdiffusive, diffusive, or superdiffusive-and transitions between\nanisotropic and isotropic regimes, depending on the initial vorticity packing,\nflow structure, and stage of evolution. At later times, transport is dominated\nby the motion of large-scale coherent vortices, whose dynamics are also\ninfluenced by the initial vorticity packing ranging from subdiffusive trapping\nrotational motion and random walks, and L\\'evy flight-like events. These\nfindings offer insights into transport in quasi-2D systems-ranging from\nlaboratory-scale flows to geophysical phenomena and astrophysical\nstructures-through analogies with 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence.",

However, several existing works\nhave shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to\nprivacy leakage. Although Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy\nconcerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model\nperformance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters,\nefficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more\nchallenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically\nDifferentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we\ncombine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with\nautomatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing\ndynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It\nexhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective\nfunctions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further\nsuggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random\nprojection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while\nmaintaining privacy. Our code is available here.",

In the majority of them\nthere is just one associated galaxy but in few cases, many companions are also\ndiscovered and in two cases the QSO is found in rich galaxy environments. The\npossible contamination due to a chance projection of the companion galaxies is\nfound less than 5%. Based on the available data we expect on average to find\n\\sim2 associated companion galaxies for each QSO. A small fraction (13%) of the\ncompanion galaxies exhibits [OII] emission lines as signature of recent star\nformation.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of\ndeep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based\non heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph\ntransformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and\nlinks (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical\nexpression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it\nhard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available\ndata to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for\nexplaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where\nexplanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database\nthat mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global\nabductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,\nSegoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between\ndeterminacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of\ngranularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones\nhighlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of\ntuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case\nof hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive\nsearch over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are\nmodel-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of\nlearnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical\nstudy on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different\nrecord-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed\nexplanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.",

While a promising diagrammatic\napproach has recently been introduced for isolated systems, the resulting\nnonlinear response functions remain unstable at long times, a characteristic\nfeature of integrable classical systems. Here, we extend this framework to\nincorporate system-bath interactions under the weak-anharmonicity approximation\nand explore the resulting conditions for bath-induced stabilization. The\nresulting expression for the weakly anharmonic response function is remarkably\nsimple and exhibits a one-to-one correspondence with the quantum counterpart in\nthe $\\hbar\\to 0$ limit, offering potential computational advantages in\nextending the approach to large, multi-oscillator systems. We find that (to\nlowest order in anharmonicity) the bath-induced stabilization of both linear\nand nonlinear classical response functions depends sensitively on the nature of\nspectral density, particularly on the balance between low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency components. Application of this classical diagrammatic approach\nto 2D IR spectroscopy of the amide I band captures the characteristic\npopulation-time-dependent dynamics associated with spectral diffusion,\nsuggesting that the approach may prove useful in describing real experimental\nsystems at ambient temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Existing theoretical analyses on Faraday waves in Hele-Shaw cells typically\nadopt gap-averaged governing equations and rely on Hamraoui's model coming from\nmolecular kinetics theory, thereby oversimplifying essential transverse\ninformation, such as contact line velocity and capillary hysteresis, and\nconflicting with the unsteady meniscus dynamics. In this paper, a gap-resolved\napproach is developed by directly modeling the transverse gap flow and the\ncontact angle dynamics, which overcomes the aforementioned limitations,\nultimately yielding a modified damping with respect to the static contact angle\nand hysteresis range. A novel amplitude equation for Faraday waves is derived\nthat combines this damping and the gap-averaged counterpart based on the\noscillatory Stokes boundary layer, with the viscous dissipation preserved. By\nmeans of Lyapunov's first method, an explicit analytical expression for the\ncritical stability boundary is established. Two series of laboratory\nexperiments are performed that focus, respectively, on evolutions of the\nlateral meniscus and the longitudinal free surface near the Faraday onset, from\nwhich key parameters relevant to the theory are precisely measured. Based on\nthe experimental data, the validity of the proposed mathematical model for\naddressing the Faraday instability problem in Hele-Shaw cells is confirmed, and\nthe generation and development mechanisms of the onset are clarified. We find\nthat the dispersion relation is significantly affected by the pinned contact\nline constraints, which partially compensate for the detuning caused by\noscillatory Stokes flow approximation.",

From the axion-photon action in an FLRW\nbackground with primordial magnetic fields (PMFs), we derive the\nscale-dependent conversion probability including plasma effects. Resonant\nconversion, arising when the axion mass matches the plasma-induced photon mass,\nproduces soft photons in the MHz-GHz range. By modeling stochastic PMFs with\namplitude $B_0$ and spectral index $n_{\\rm B}$, we show that axion-like\nparticles with mass $\\sim 10^{-14}$-$10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and nanogauss-level\nnearly scale invariant PMFs can explain both ARCADE2 and EDGES. Heating from\nPMF dissipation via ambipolar diffusion and turbulent decay reduces the 21-cm\ntrough, shifting the viable parameter space.

    "abstract": "We present second-order optimally stable Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta\n(RK) schemes with application to a modified set of shallow water equations that\ncan be used to model the dynamics of lava flows. The schemes are optimally\nstable in the sense that they satisfy, at the space-time discretization level,\na condition analogous to the \\texttt{L}-stability of Runge-Kutta methods for\nordinary differential equations. A novel (pseudo-)staggered Galerkin scheme is\nintroduced, which can be interpreted as an extension of the classical two-step\nTaylor-Galerkin (TG2) scheme. The method is derived by combining a von Neumann\nstability analysis with a Lax-Wendroff procedure. For the discretization of the\nnon-conservative terms that characterize the lava flow model, we employ the\nPath-Conservative (PC) method. The proposed scheme is evaluated on a number of\nrelevant test cases, demonstrating accuracy, robustness, and well-balancing\nproperties for the lava flow model.",

Exogenous inputs are fused via an embedding layer,\neliminating the need to forecast them and enabling the model to attend to their\nshort-term influences more effectively. We evaluate our approach on the\nLausanneCity dataset, which includes measurements from four urban drainage\nsensors, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when using only\nendogenous variables. Performance also improves with the inclusion of exogenous\nvariables and forecast reports. To assess generalization and scalability, we\nadditionally test the model on three large-scale synthesized datasets,\ngenerated from MeteoSwiss records, the Lorenz Attractors model, and the Random\nFields model, each representing a different level of temporal complexity across\n100 nodes.

Multi-modal medical image fusion\nintegrates useful information from different complementary medical images with\ndifferent modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and\nobjectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical\ndiagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of\nmodality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and\ncannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their\napplication in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce\nFlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate\nflexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal\nand tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse\ntransforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition\ninputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion\nprocess and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the\nExpectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration\nprocess, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal\ninformation from source images, independently of the number of input images. We\ncompared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them\non Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The\nexperimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in\nmedical image fusion with varying inputs.

    "abstract": "With the advent of quantum computing, the increasing threats to security\nposes a great challenge to communication networks. Recent innovations in this\nfield resulted in promising technologies such as Quantum Key Distribution\n(QKD), which enables the generation of unconditionally secure keys,\nestablishing secure communications between remote nodes. Additionally, QKD\nnetworks enable the interconnection of multinode architectures, extending the\npoint-to-point nature of QKD. However, due to the limitations of the current\nstate of technology, the scalability of QKD networks remains a challenge toward\nfeasible implementations. When it comes to long-distance implementations,\ntrusted relay nodes partially solve the distance issue through the forwarding\nof the distributed keys, allowing applications that do not have a direct QKD\nlink to securely share key material. Even though the relay procedure itself has\nbeen extensively studied, the establishment of the relaying node path still\nlacks a solution. This paper proposes an innovative network architecture that\nsolves the challenges of Key Management System (KMS) identification, relay path\ndiscovery, and scalability of QKD networks by integrating Software-Defined\nNetworking (SDN) principles, and establishing high-level virtual KMSs (vKMS) in\neach node and creating a new entity called the Quantum Security Controller\n(QuSeC). The vKMS serves the end-user key requests, managing the multiple KMSs\nwithin the node and abstracting the user from discovering the correct KMS.\nAdditionally, based on the high-level view of the network topology and status,\nthe QuSeC serves the path discovery requests from vKMSs, computing the\nend-to-end (E2E) relay path and applying security policies. The paper also\nprovides a security analysis of the proposal, identifying the security levels\nof the architecture and analyzing the core networking security properties.",

Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in\ncontrollability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and\ndistributional fidelity.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel design framework for photonic matrix\nmultiplication based on programmable photonic integrated circuits using double\nracetrack (DRT) resonators as building blocks. Here, we analytically\ndemonstrate that the transfer function of the DRT resonator building block\nresembles that conventional building blocks, such as directional couplers and\nMZI, making it suitable for building programmable circuits that handle complex\nmatrix calculations. Using this new DRT resonators building block, a 3-by-3\nphotonic processor is implemented and validated through full-wave Finite\nElement Method (FEM) simulations, and scalability is further analysed using\nhybrid FEM-circuit modelling. Additionally, we implement a low-pass filter as a\nnon-unitary system example, showcasing the flexibility of the approach. Results\nconfirm high fidelity between simulated and analytical models, supporting the\nviability of DRT resonators for reconfigurable photonic circuits. We believe\nthat the proposed DRT resonator building blocks have the potential to\ncomplement and integrate with other previously reported blocks, thereby\nenhancing the fidelity and expanding the application scope of programmable\nphotonic integrated circuits, particularly for all-optical signal processing in\ncommunication systems and for integration within microwave photonics platforms\ntargeting emerging telecommunications technologies.",

    "abstract": "We consider the steady heat transfer between a collection of impermeable\nobstacles immersed in an incompressible 2D potential flow, when each obstacle\nhas a prescribed boundary temperature distribution. Inside the fluid, the\ntemperature satisfies a variable-coefficient elliptic partial differential\nequation (PDE), the solution of which usually requires expensive techniques. To\nsolve this problem efficiently, we construct multiply-connected conformal maps\nunder which both the domain and governing equation are greatly simplified. In\nparticular, each obstacle is mapped to a horizontal slit and the governing\nequation becomes a constant-coefficient elliptic PDE. We then develop a\nboundary integral approach in the mapped domain to solve for the temperature\nfield when arbitrary Dirichlet temperature data is specified on the obstacles.\nThe inverse conformal map is then used to compute the temperature field in the\nphysical domain. We construct our multiply-connected conformal maps by\nexploiting the flexible and highly accurate AAA-LS algorithm. In\nmultiply-connected domains and domains with non-constant boundary temperature\ndata, we note similarities and key differences in the temperature fields and\nNusselt number scalings as compared to the isothermal simply-connected problem\nanalyzed by Choi et al. (2005). In particular, we derive new asymptotic\nexpressions for the Nusselt number in the case of arbitrary non-constant\ntemperature data in singly connected domains at low P\\'eclet number, and verify\nthese scalings numerically. While our language focuses on the problem of\nconjugate heat transfer, our methods and findings are equally applicable to the\nadvection-diffusion of any passive scalar in a potential flow.",

Can such undesirable traffic patterns,\ninduced by intrinsic human driving behaviors, be tamed effectively and\ninexpensively? Taking advantage of emerging connectivity and autonomy\ntechnologies, we envision a simple yet realistic traffic control system to\nachieve this goal. To prove the concept, we design such a system to suppress\nthese waves while maximizing traffic throughput in the Tadaki setting: a\ncircular road with varying number of vehicles. We first introduce our driver\nbehavior model and demonstrate how our calibrated human driving agents can\nclosely reproduce the observed human driving patterns in the original Tadaki\nexperiment. We then propose a simple control system mediated via connected\nautomated vehicles (CAV) whose ideal speed parameter is treated as a\nsystem-level control variable adapted to the local vehicle density of the\ntraffic. The objective of the control system is set up as a tradeoff:\nmaximizing throughput while minimizing traffic oscillation. Following\ncomputational mechanism design, we search for the optimal control policy as a\nfunction of vehicle density and the tradeoff attitude parameter. This can be\ndone by letting all vehicles play a simulated game of CAV-modulated traffic\nunder such a control system. Our simulation results show that the improvements\nin traffic efficiency and smoothness are substantial. Finally, we envision how\nsuch a traffic control system can be realized in an environment with smart\nvehicles connected to a smart infrastructure or via a scheme of variable speed\nadvisory.",

This model makes these operating\nsystems (OSes) incompatible by design with a large class of software:\nmultiprocess POSIX applications. Indeed, the semantics of the primitive used to\ncreate POSIX processes, fork, are inextricably tied to the existence of\nmultiple address spaces.\n  Prior approaches addressing this issue trade off lightweightness,\ncompatibility and/or isolation. We propose {\\mu}Fork, a single-address-space\noperating system design supporting POSIX fork on modern hardware without\ncompromising on any of these key objectives. {\\mu}Fork emulates POSIX processes\n({\\mu}processes) and achieves fork by creating for the child a copy of the\nparent {\\mu}process' memory at a different location within a single address\nspace. This approach presents two challenges: relocating the child's absolute\nmemory references (pointers), as well as providing user/kernel and\n{\\mu}processes isolation without impacting lightweightness. We address them\nusing CHERI. We implement {\\mu}Fork and evaluate it upon three real-world\nuse-cases: Redis snapshots, Nginx multi-worker deployments, and Zygote FaaS\nworker warm-up. {\\mu}Fork outperforms previous work and traditional monolithic\nOSes on key lightweightness metrics by an order of magnitude, e.g. it can offer\na fork-bound FaaS function throughput 24% higher than that of a monolithic OS,\nand can fork a {\\mu}process in 54{\\mu}s, 3.7x faster than a traditional fork.",

In this work, we propose GrACE, a\nGenerative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and\nreliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in\nwhich the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden\nstate and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in\nreal-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with\ncalibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and\ntwo benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the\nbest discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,\noutperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or\nan auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time\nscaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that\nusing GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also\nsignificantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling\nscheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying\nLLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm\nto enable low-capability edge nodes to cooperatively execute\ncomputation-intensive tasks. However, straggling edge nodes (stragglers)\nsignificantly degrade the performance of MEC systems by prolonging computation\nlatency. While coded distributed computing (CDC) as an effective technique is\nwidely adopted to mitigate straggler effects, existing CDC schemes exhibit two\ncritical limitations: (i) They cannot successfully decode the final result\nunless the number of received results reaches a fixed recovery threshold, which\nseriously restricts their flexibility; (ii) They suffer from inherent poles in\ntheir encoding/decoding functions, leading to decoding inaccuracies and\nnumerical instability in the computational results. To address these\nlimitations, this paper proposes an approximated CDC scheme based on\nbarycentric rational interpolation. The proposed CDC scheme offers several\noutstanding advantages. Firstly, it can decode the final result leveraging any\nreturned results from workers. Secondly, it supports computations over both\nfinite and real fields while ensuring numerical stability. Thirdly, its\nencoding/decoding functions are free of poles, which not only enhances\napproximation accuracy but also achieves flexible accuracy tuning. Fourthly, it\nintegrates a novel BRI-based gradient coding algorithm accelerating the\ntraining process while providing robustness against stragglers. Finally,\nexperimental results reveal that the proposed scheme is superior to existing\nCDC schemes in both waiting time and approximate accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made\nsignificant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains\nchallenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that\npatches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance\non dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion\nby involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict\nspatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,\ni.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure\ninter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for\ndense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.\nThese observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for\ndense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill\nthe patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we\npropose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average\nPrecision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and\nadaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.\nSecond, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose\nthe object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.\nSpecifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via\ncross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks\nsoundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in\nhttps://github.com/KID-7391/CoTAP.",

A few attempts have been made in recent years to\njointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world\napplications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,\nthe target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,\nwith low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal\nresults in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a\nsemantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution\nmethod. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional\ngeneration problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity\nsensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal\nfeature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as\npure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract\nthe global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source\nimages and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising\nprocess via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at\nmultiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with\ncross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a\npowerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.\nExtensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and\nour AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics\nin the fused images.

We\nexplore both constant thresholds for r_p and Del_V_sys corresponding to 150 kpc\nand 150 km/s on all galaxies in our sample, and mass-dependent thresholds based\non a stellar-to-halo mass relation. We find the average number of companions\nper dwarf in our sample to be 13% (20%) when considering mass-dependent\n(constant) thresholds. In the stellar mass regime of 2*10^8 < M_* / M_Sun <\n5*10^9, we find a three times higher frequency (11.6%) of dwarf companions than\npreviously determined from optical spectroscopic studies, highlighting the\npower of HI for finding dwarf multiples.

While the two kernels show comparable performance, we show that\nGDQC can achieve higher expressiveness. Third, instead of restricting to\nobservables at single time steps, we combine information from multiple stages\nof the quantum evolution via pooling operations. Using extensive simulations on\ntwo molecular benchmark datasets, MUTAG and PTC\\_FM, we find: (a) QEK and GDQC\nperform competitively with leading classical algorithms; and (b) pooling\nfurther improves performance, enabling quantum-feature kernels to surpass\nclassical baselines.

Near-Memory Processing\n(NMP) accelerators that stack memory directly on the compute through hybrid\nbonding have demonstrated high bandwidth with high energy efficiency, becoming\na promising architecture for MoE models. However, as NMP accelerators comprise\ndistributed memory and computation, how to map the MoE computation directly\ndetermines the LLM inference efficiency.

Our report utilises pre-tax\nincome ($PI$) and total assets ($TA$) data from 567 companies listed on the\nFTSE All-Share index, gathered from the Refinitiv EIKON database, covering 14\nyears, i.e., the period from 2009 to 2022. We also derive the $PI/TA$ ratio,\nand distinguish between positive and negative $PI$ cases. We test the\nconformity of such data to Benford's Laws,- specifically studying the first\nsignificant digit ($Fd$), the second significant digit ($Sd$), and the first\nand second significant digits ($FSd$). We use and justify two pertinent tests,\nthe $\\chi^2$ and the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). We find that both tests are\nnot leading to conclusions in complete agreement with each other, - in\nparticular the MAD test entirely rejects the Benford's Laws conformity of the\nreported financial data. From the mere accounting point of view, we conclude\nthat the findings not only cast some doubt on the reported financial data, but\nalso suggest that many more investigations be envisaged on closely related\nmatters. On the other hand, the study of a ratio, like $PI/TA$, of variables\nwhich are (or not) Benford's Laws compliant add to the literature debating\nwhether such indirect variables should (or not) be Benford's Laws compliant.",

    "abstract": "Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our\nunderstanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically\nanalyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single\nenvironmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic\nmicrobial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from\ndifferent environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial\ncommunities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological\nconditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating\nboth spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed\npublicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time\npoints, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations\nusing our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates\nalgorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same\nenvironmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from\nmultiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of\nconventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not\nentirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network\ninference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing\nrelevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard\napproaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser\ngenerates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results\ndemonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing\nalgorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments\n(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in\ncross-environment (All) scenarios.",

Geostatistics leverages\nthe spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the\nrelationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We\npropose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through\nengineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this\napproach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of\nregression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and\nprobabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six\nfieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,\nclay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and\nin-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable\nuncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several\nother spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as\nwell as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random\nforest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%\ncompared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This\nimprovement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN\nalgorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR\nfeatures. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small\nsample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for\nweak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal\nsoil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a\nvery robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in\nprecision agriculture.",

Further, the three-stroke engine (without\nthe adiabatic strokes) yields the same performance as the five-stroke engine.\nFor arbitrary working medium and non-selective measurements, we prove that the\ntotal work output of a five-stroke engine is equal to the sum of the work\noutputs of the corresponding four-stroke and three-stroke engines. For\nmeasurement directions other than z-z, there may be many possible orderings of\nthe post-measurement probabilities that yield an active state.

    "abstract": "Recent experiments on twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide have\ndemonstrated that moir\\'e semiconductors can be used to realize a relativistic\nMott transition, i.e., a quantum phase transition from a Dirac semimetal to a\ncorrelated insulating state, by twist-angle tuning. In addition, signatures of\nvan Hove singularities were observed in the material's moir\\'e valence bands,\nsuggesting further potential for the emergence of strongly-correlated states in\nthis moir\\'e semiconductor. Based on a Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum\nmodel, we provide a detailed analysis of the twist-angle dependence of the\nsystem's moir\\'e valence band structure, focusing on both, the evolution of the\nDirac excitations and the Fermi-surface structure with its Lifshitz transitions\nacross the van Hove fillings. We exhibit that the twist angle can be used to\nband engineer a high-order van Hove singularity with power-law exponent~$-1/4$\nin the density of states, which can be accessed by gate tuning of the hole\nfilling. We then study the magnetic phase diagram of an effective Hubbard model\nfor twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide on the effective moir\\'e\nhoneycomb superlattice with tight-binding parameters fitted to the two topmost\nbands of the continuum model. To that end, we employ a self-consistent\nHartree-Fock mean-field approach in real space. Fixing the angle-dependent\nHubbard interaction based on the experimental findings, we explore a broad\nparameter range of twist angle, filling, and temperature. We find a rich\nvariety of magnetic states that we expect to be accessible in future\nexperiments by twist or gate tuning, including, e.g., a non-coplanar\nspin-density wave with non-zero spin chirality and a half-metallic uniaxial\nspin-density wave.",

By deriving the\nthermodynamic potential up to second order in both the disorder potential and\npairing fluctuations, we obtain self-consistent expressions for the number\nequation, condensate fraction, superfluid fraction and sound speed at zero\ntemperature. In the dilute BEC limit, our results analytically reproduce the\nknown continuum limits of weakly interacting bosons, where weak disorder\ndepletes the superfluid more strongly than the condensate due to broken\ntranslational symmetry, and enhances the sound speed through the\novercompensation of the static compressibility. These findings establish a\nunified and controlled framework for describing the BCS-BEC crossover in\ndisordered lattice models, and they provide a foundation for future extensions\nto finite temperatures and multiband Hubbard models.",

These models often learn task-agnostic\ncorrelations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,\nlimiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in\nreal-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling\nframework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from\ntask-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable\nprompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we\ncurate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating\ncaptions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution\nperformance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based\nmethods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation\nstudies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment\nsignificantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior\nunder domain shift.

We study a specific type of\nself-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a\nmodel explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have\npredicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that\nare valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no\nmore than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs\ntypically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little\ninsight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to\ngenerate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits\nthat fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is\nconsistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings\nsuggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at\nworst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour.

By properly defining\nthe bare gauge coupling and then the effective $\\xi$, we validate our\n$\\xi$-gauge fixing procedure by successfully reproducing the $\\xi$-dependent\nRI/MOM renormalization constants for local quark bilinear operators at 0.2\\%\nlevel, up to $\\xi \\sim 1$.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in scientific machine learning is solving partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) on complex domains, where the curved geometry\ncomplicates the approximation of functions and their derivatives required by\ndifferential operators. This paper establishes the first simultaneous\napproximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds. We prove that a\nconstant-depth $\\mathrm{ReLU}^{k-1}$ network with bounded weights--a property\nthat plays a crucial role in controlling generalization error--can approximate\nany function in the Sobolev space $\\mathcal{W}_p^{k}(\\mathcal{M}^d)$ to an\nerror of $\\varepsilon$ in the $\\mathcal{W}_p^{s}(\\mathcal{M}^d)$ norm, for\n$k\\geq 3$ and $s<k$, using $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-d/(k-s)})$ nonzero\nparameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only\non the intrinsic dimension $d$. These results readily extend to functions in\nH\\\"older-Zygmund spaces. We complement this result with a matching lower bound,\nproving our construction is nearly optimal by showing the required number of\nparameters matches up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof of the lower bound\nintroduces novel estimates for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and\npseudo-dimension of the network's high-order derivative classes. These\ncomplexity bounds provide a theoretical cornerstone for learning PDEs on\nmanifolds involving derivatives. Our analysis reveals that the network\narchitecture leverages a sparse structure to efficiently exploit the manifold's\nlow-dimensional geometry.",

Existing detection approaches,\nsuch as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not\naddress the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,\nwhere responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore\npresent MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time,\nunsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor\naccess to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes\ndomains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into\natomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using\nsynonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the\nretrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms\ncontradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a\nresponse-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG\nlocalizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,\npregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),\nallowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure\nthresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a\nproprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for\ndetecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based\nconversational agents.

For detection problems -- where the goal is to\ntest a planted distribution $\\mathbb{P}'$ against a null distribution\n$\\mathbb{P}$ with independent components -- the standard approach is to bound\nthe advantage using an $\\mathbb{L}^2(\\mathbb{P})$-orthonormal family of\npolynomials. However, this method breaks down for estimation tasks or more\ncomplex testing problems where $\\mathbb{P}$ has some planted structures, so\nthat no simple $\\mathbb{L}^2(\\mathbb{P})$-orthogonal polynomial family is\navailable. To address this challenge, several technical workarounds have been\nproposed [SW22,SW25], though their implementation can be delicate. In this\nwork, we propose a more direct proof strategy. Focusing on random graph models,\nwe construct a basis of polynomials that is almost orthonormal under\n$\\mathbb{P}$, in precisely those regimes where statistical-computational gaps\narise. This almost orthonormal basis not only yields a direct route to\nestablishing low-degree lower bounds, but also allows us to explicitly identify\nthe polynomials that optimize the low-degree criterion. This, in turn, provides\ninsights into the design of optimal polynomial-time algorithms.

Here, we use a mundane\nfood-wrapping film as a sample and observe the crack propagation velocity with\npulling the sample at a constant speed in the direction perpendicular to the\ncrack. As a result, we find the jump occurs at a critical strain with high\nreproducibility.

In this context, magnetic skyrmions\nhave been widely considered for in-situ processing devices due to their\nmobility and enhanced lifetime in materials with broken inversion symmetry.\nHowever, modern applications in non-volatile reservoir or neuromorphic\ncomputing raise the additional demand for non-linear inter-soliton\ninteractions. Here we report that solitons in easy-plane magnets, such as\nbimerons and antibimerons, show greater versatility and potential for\nnon-linear interactions than skyrmions and antiskyrmions, making them superior\ncandidates for this class of applications. Using first-principles and\ntransition state theory, we predict the coexistence of degenerate bimerons and\nantibimerons at zero field in a van der Waals heterostructure\nFe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ -- an experimentally feasible system. We\ndemonstrate that, owing to their distinct structural symmetry, bimerons exhibit\nfundamentally different behavior from skyrmions and cannot be regarded as their\nin-plane counterparts, as is often assumed. This distinction leads to unique\nproperties of bimerons and antibimerons, which arise from the unbroken\nrotational symmetry in easy-plane magnets. These range from anisotropic\nsoliton-soliton interactions to strong entropic effects on their lifetime,\ndriven by the non-local nature of thermal excitations.

    "abstract": "This study addresses the well-posedness of a hemivariational inequality\nderived from the convective Brinkman-Forchheimer extended Darcy (CBFeD) model\nin both two and three dimensions. The CBFeD model describes the behavior of\nincompressible viscous fluid flow through a porous medium, incorporating the\neffects of convection, damping, and nonlinear resistance. The mathematical\nframework captures steady-state flow conditions under a no-slip boundary\nassumption, with a non-monotone boundary condition that links the total fluid\npressure and the velocity's normal component through a Clarke subdifferential\nformulation. To facilitate the analysis, we introduce an auxiliary\nhemivariational inequality resembling a nonlinear Stokes-type problem with\ndamping and pumping terms, which serves as a foundational tool in establishing\nthe existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for the CBFeD model. The\nanalytical strategy integrates techniques from convex minimization theory with\nfixed-point methods, specifically employing either the Banach contraction\nmapping principle or Schauder's fixed point theorem. The Banach-based approach,\nin particular, leads to a practical iterative algorithm that solves the\noriginal nonlinear hemivariational inequality by sequentially solving\nStokes-type problems, ensuring convergence of the solution sequence.\nAdditionally, we derive equivalent variational formulations in terms of\nminimization problems. These formulations lay the groundwork for the design of\nefficient and stable numerical schemes tailored to simulate flows governed by\nthe CBFeD model.",

    "abstract": "I study the internal structure of the Dirac magnetic monopole in a\ndeconstructed $U(1)$ gauge theory. The deconstructed $U(1)$ gauge theory has a\nproduct $U(1)^N$ gauge group, which breaks down to the diagonal\n$U(1)_{\\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group. A linear superposition of the Dirac\nmonopoles each from each $U(1)$ gauge group placed on top of each other in the\n3D space constitutes a Dirac monopole with a unit magnetic charge under the\nunbroken $U(1)_{\\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group. However, the Dirac monopole in\neach $U(1)$ gauge group has a fractional magnetic charge of the unbroken\n$U(1)_{\\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group with the same sign, which makes these\n``constituent'' Dirac monopoles repel each other. Therefore, for the\n``composite'' Dirac monopole of the $U(1)_{\\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group to be\nstable, there must be attractive forces that counter the repulsive magnetic\nCoulomb forces. I argue that such attractive forces are provided by the\nNielsen-Olesen type magnetic flux tubes of unbroken gauge groups. This internal\nstructure of the composite Dirac monopole of $U(1)_{\\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group\nresembles the composite magnetic monopole found in the model constructed by\nSaraswat arXiv:1608.06951. I estimate the size of the Dirac monopole in\n$U(1)_{\\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group from the balance between the magnetic\nCoulomb forces and the forces from the tension of the magnetic flux tubes.\nImplications of the results for the Weak Gravity Conjecture are briefly\ndiscussed.",

In this paper, we propose a totally different algorithm paradigm.\nOur key insight is that by representing the source curve as a sequence of line\nsegment primitives, the Voronoi decomposition constrained to the parametric\nsurface enables localized offset computation. Specifically, the offsetting\nprocess can be efficiently traced by independently visiting the corresponding\nVoronoi cells. To address the challenge of computing the Voronoi decomposition\non parametric surfaces, we introduce two key techniques. First, we employ\nintrinsic triangulation in the parameter space to accurately capture geodesic\ndistances. Second, instead of directly computing the surface-constrained\nVoronoi decomposition, we decompose the triangulated parameter plane using a\nseries of plane cutting operations. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nalgorithm achieves superior accuracy and runtime performance compared to\nexisting methods.

First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D\ninputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient\nspatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor\nadaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment\nConstraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and\ncapacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid\nbut practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an\nembodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task\nplanning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding\nmechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective\nregulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling\ncontext-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware\nReasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment\nconstraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are\nboth goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning\nperformance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of\ndownstream scenarios.

In order to identify their sources, we need\nprecise knowledge of the mass composition of UHECRs. The direct detection of\nUHECRs is not feasible at energies above 0.1 PeV, necessitating the use of\nmass-sensitive observables of extended air showers induced by UHECRs\ninteracting with the atmosphere. One way to achieve high statistics for these\nmass-sensitive observables is to use ground-based detector arrays, such as the\nSurface Detector (SD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The SD consists of three\nsub-arrays of independent detector stations arranged in triangular grids with\ndifferent spacings. Recently, it has been shown that neural networks (NNs) can\nextract mass-sensitive observables from data taken by the SD-1500, the largest\nsub-detector of the SD. In this contribution, we demonstrate the feasibility of\nusing NNs to reconstruct a high-level shower observable, the depth of the\nshower maximum, from data simulated for and observed by the SD-750, the\nsecond-largest detector array nested within the SD-1500. A simulation study\nshows that the SD-750 NN exhibits behavior similar to that of an SD-1500 NN and\noutperforms the latter in the energy range [1, 10) EeV. Moreover, we show that,\nafter performing a correction and calibration procedure, the predictions of the\nSD-750 NN are consistent with the measurement of the depth of the shower\nmaximum obtained by the Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates automatic piano transcription based on\ncomputationally-efficient yet high-performant variants of the Transformer that\ncan capture longer-term dependency over the whole musical piece. Recently,\ntransformer-based sequence-to-sequence models have demonstrated excellent\nperformance in piano transcription. These models, however, fail to deal with\nthe whole piece at once due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention\nmechanism, and music signals are thus typically processed in a sliding-window\nmanner in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient\narchitecture with sparse attention mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce\nsliding-window self-attention mechanisms for both the encoder and decoder, and\na hybrid global-local cross-attention mechanism that attends to various spans\naccording to the MIDI token types. We also use a hierarchical pooling strategy\nbetween the encoder and decoder to further reduce computational load. Our\nexperiments on the MAESTRO dataset showed that the proposed model achieved a\nsignificant reduction in computational cost and memory usage, accelerating\ninference speed, while maintaining transcription performance comparable to the\nfull-attention baseline. This allows for training with longer audio contexts on\nthe same hardware, demonstrating the viability of sparse attention for building\nefficient and high-performance piano transcription systems.

Theoretical modelling has produced\nconflicting results regarding the mechanism responsible for breaking the disc.\nAnalytical predictions for the measured parameters of GW Ori suggest the disc\nis only marginally stable to tearing. We present new high-resolution\nsimulations of GW Ori that replicate the wavelike regime expected in thick,\nlow-turbulence protoplanetary discs for the first time to settle this question.\nUsing the most optimistic values of misalignment and stellar mass ratio allowed\nby observational constraints, we find that the GW Ori disc can be torn by\nstellar torques alone, without need for an embedded planet. Even if the disc\nretains a smooth warp in simulations with similar parameters, it is likely that\nany small perturbation in the density or temperature structure could cause the\ndisc to break. The new simulations rule out retrograde disc rotation relative\nto the stellar orbits and tentatively suggest the thicker ($h/r = 0.04$) disc\nbetter matches observations. Going forward, we should take care to ensure\nmodels of GW Ori and similar systems appropriately represent the propagation of\nwarps. Additionally, analytical predictions are derived from idealized (and\noften massless) discs and it is useful to assess how each observed disc might\ndeviate from those assumptions, especially in the context of a young and active\nstar-forming neighbourhood.",

This assumption\nbreaks down in complex fluids, such as protein or polymeric solutions, where\nthe solute can influence evaporation through changes in water activity. Here,\nwe investigate model respiratory droplets primarily composed of water, salt,\nand a type of the glycoprotein mucin. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observe\nthe formation of a well-defined protein ring at the droplet edge as water\nevaporates. The growth and morphology of this ring exhibit a strong dependence\non ambient relative humidity ($H_r$), revealing dynamics that existing models\ncannot capture. Specifically, we find that protein accumulation at the edge is\ngoverned by the feedback between local solute concentration and evaporation\nrate. To account for this, we develop a minimal theoretical model based on the\nlubrication approximation, incorporating the coupling between hydrodynamics and\nsolute transport through the evaporation rate.

    "abstract": "Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments\nthat require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit\ncommunication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered\nin the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,\nsynchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily\non coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,\nlaw enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in\nphysical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit\ncommunication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial\ncoordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and\nadaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative\nonline search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and\nteam members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and\ncoordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by\nmeasuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements\nwithin shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136\nparticipants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.\nResults show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while\nadaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,\nsuggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal\ndynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over\ntime. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in\nrole-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive\nstrategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support\nsystems.",

We propose a novel Target Speaker Speech-Image\nRetrieval task and a framework that learns the relationship between images and\nmulti-speaker speech signals in the presence of a target speaker. Our method\nintegrates pre-trained self-supervised audio encoders with vision models via\ntarget speaker-aware contrastive learning, conditioned on a Target Speaker\nExtraction and Retrieval module. This enables the system to extract spoken\ncommands from the target speaker and align them with corresponding images.\nExperiments on SpokenCOCO2Mix and SpokenCOCO3Mix show that TSRE significantly\noutperforms existing methods, achieving 36.3% and 29.9% Recall@1 in 2 and 3\nspeaker scenarios, respectively - substantial improvements over single speaker\nbaselines and state-of-the-art models.

    "abstract": "It is often argued that gravitational instability of realistic protoplanetary\ndiscs is only possible at distances larger than $\\sim 50$ au from the central\nstar, requiring high disc masses and accretion rates, and that therefore disc\nfragmentation results in the production of brown dwarfs rather than gas giant\nplanets. However, the effects of dust growth on opacity can be very significant\nbut have not been taken into account systematically in the models of\nfragmenting discs. We employ dust opacity that depends on both temperature and\nmaximum grain size to evaluate analytically the properties of a critically\nfragmenting protoplanetary disc. We find that dust growth may promote disc\nfragmentation at disc radii as small as $\\sim 30$ au. As a result, the critical\ndisc masses and accretion rates are smaller, and the initial fragment masses\nare in the gas giant planet mass regime. While this suggests that formation of\ngas giant planets by disc fragmentation may be more likely than usually\nbelieved, we caution that numerical models of the process are needed to\nevaluate the effects not taken into account here, e.g., dust grain mobility and\nfragment evolution after disc fragmentation.",

    "abstract": "Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development\nGoals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global\nchallenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of\nsupervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer\nlearning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.\nThis paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,\nusing citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL\ncitations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we\ndevelop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models\n(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and\napplications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.\nCross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based\nretrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that\naligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG\nassociations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping\npatents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression\nmodels. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1)\ninternal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method\noutperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot\nLLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation,\nco-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic,\ncognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological\nclassifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic\nalignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.",

Over the past few\ndecades, many studies have investigated the behavior of such models under\nvarious incidence functions.

This paper\naddresses this issue by proposing an intuitive theoretical framework that\nrecasts the original problem as determining the contributions of different\nincidence functions to the dynamics based on given observations. Specifically,\nthe choice of an incidence function is linked to a weight assigned to it.\nMathematically, this leads to a PDE-constrained optimization problem, where the\nobjective is to identify the weights of a convex combination of multiple\nincidence functions that best approximate the experimental observations\ngenerated by the model.

    "abstract": "The application layer of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a growing source of\nsecurity vulnerabilities, as developers often neglect to implement critical\nprotections such as encryption, authentication, and freshness. While formal\nverification offers a principled way to check these properties, the manual\neffort of constructing formal models makes it impractical for large-scale\nanalysis. This paper introduces a key insight: BLE application security\nanalysis can be reframed as a semantic translation problem, i.e., from\nreal-world code to formal models. We leverage large language models (LLMs) not\nto directly detect vulnerabilities, but to serve as translators that convert\nBLE-specific code into process models verifiable by tools like ProVerif. We\nimplement this idea in VerifiaBLE, a system that combines static analysis,\nprompt-guided LLM translation, and symbolic verification to check three core\nsecurity features: encryption, randomness, and authentication. Applied to 1,050\nAndroid BLE apps, VerifiaBLE uncovers systemic weaknesses: only 10.2\\% of apps\nimplement all three protections, while 53.9\\% omit them entirely. Our work\ndemonstrates that using LLMs as structured translators can lower the barrier to\nformal methods, unlocking scalable verification across security-critical\ndomains.",

    "abstract": "Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of\nlesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,\nMRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most\nsegmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities\nand cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to\nunseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.\nThis work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that\ncontain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,\nand heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any\navailable imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,\nthus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a\nmodality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input\nchannels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image\naugmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations\ndifferentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to\ncreate artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical\nintegrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of\npathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and\nwhite matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,\nDWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the\nability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,\nwhile being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.\nProject code: https://github.com/Anthony-P-Addison/AGN-MOD-SEG",

    "abstract": "Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of\nVision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some\nrely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined\ntoolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single\nreasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate\nsteps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the\nuse of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address\nthis, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual\ninformation of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is\nthat this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation\nconsistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is\nunsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a\nlearnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved\nwith code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive\nframework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct\nvisual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with\nreinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a\ndata-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical\nhallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each\nstrategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments\ndemonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding\nbenchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also\nhow to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each\ntask.",

We formulate the switching interaction as a dynamic game in which\nauthority is embedded directly into the system dynamics, resulting in Nash\nequilibrium(NE)-based strategies rather than ad hoc switching rules. We\nestablish the existence and characterization of NE in the space of pure\ntakeover strategies under stochastic human intent.

The\nframework is applied to a vehicle trajectory tracking problem, demonstrating\nhow equilibrium takeover strategies adapt across straight and curved path\nsegments.

Additionally, methods that presume\nsystem-wide data--global measurements and complete grid-model knowledge--are\nchallenging to realize in practice and unsuitable for large-scale operation.\nMoreover, proportional current sharing is rarely embedded into them. The whole\nsystem is a high-order, nonlinear differential system, making analysis\nintractable without principled simplifications. Hence, contraction stability\nanalysis in GFMI is proposed to guarantee the large-signal stability.\nFurthermore, a contraction-based controller is proposed to synchronize GFMI.\nAdditionally, this paper proposes integrating an auxiliary virtual-impedance\nlayer into the contraction-based controller to achieve proportional current\nsharing, while the GFMI retains global stability and voltage synchronization. A\ndispatchable virtual oscillator control (dVOC), also known as the\nAndronov--Hopf oscillator (AHO) is used to validate the proposed contraction\nstability analysis and contraction-based controller with virtual-impedance. It\nis proved that the complex multi-converter system can achieve output-feedback\ncontraction under large-signal operation.

We introduce a\npowerful neural network ansatz, Neural Transformer Backflow (NTB), formulated\nwithin a multi-band projection framework. It naturally enforces momentum\nconservation and enables efficient calculations of momentum-resolved ground\nstates. NTB attains high accuracy on small systems and scales to higher bands\nand larger system sizes far beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. By\nevaluating observables such as the structure factor and momentum distribution,\nwe show that NTB captures diverse correlated states in tMoTe$_2$, including\ncharge density waves, fractional Chern insulators, and anomalous Hall Fermi\nliquids, within a unified framework.

We begin with the two-dimensional\nCahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) model for a binary-fluid system of active\nrotors that has two important ingredients: a scalar order parameter field phi\nthat distinguishes regions with clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW)\nspinners; and an incompressible velocity field u. In addition to the\nconventional CHNS coupling between phi and u, this model has a torque-induced\nactivity term, with coefficient tau, whose consequences we explore. We\ndemonstrate that, if we increase the activity tau, it overcomes dissipation and\nthis system displays a hitherto unanticipated emergent triangular crystal, with\nspinning vortex triplets at its vertices. We show that this is a nonequilibrium\ncounterpart of an equilibrium plastic crystal. We characterise the statistical\nproperties of this novel crystal and suggest possible experimental realisations\nof this new state of active matter.",

This paper presents a comprehensive\ntechnical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing\nknowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs)\nfor question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all\nleveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness,\nfeasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities,\nstate of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question\nanswering.

For the cases of expensive control and small delay,\nwe provide exact expressions of the optimal controllers in the limit for\ninfinite control weight and vanishing delay, respectively. In the expensive\ncontrol regime, the optimal feedback control law decomposes into a delay-aware\nfiltering of the delayed state and the optimal controller in the delay-free\nsetting. Under small delays, the optimal controller is a perturbation of the\ndelay-free one which depends linearly on the delay. We illustrate our\nanalytical findings with a reaction-diffusion process over the real line and a\nmulti-agent system coupled through circulant matrices, showing that delays\nreduce the effectiveness of optimal feedback control and may require each\nsubsystem within a distributed implementation to communicate with farther-away\nlocations.",

Here, we show how isotope-induced inversion symmetry\nbreaking influences ultrafast photoisomerization processes in ethylene. Using\nextreme ultraviolet pump-near infrared probe time-of-flight mass spectrometry,\nwe find that replacing one of the carbon atoms in ethylene with a 13C isotope\nleads to twice-faster structural relaxation via ethylene-ethylidene\nisomerization in the photo-excited molecular cation. Advanced trajectory\nsurface hopping calculations incorporating the nuclear symmetry of the\nmolecular systems, reveal that it arises from the mixing of different normal\nmodes in the isotope-substituted species, interactions otherwise forbidden by\nsymmetry. Although the mixing does not alter the symmetry of the electronic\nHamiltonian, it modifies that of the nuclear Hamiltonian, causing explicit\nsymmetry breaking. This facilitates efficient intra-molecular vibrational\nenergy redistribution, lowering the isomerization yield. Our findings offer\nopportunities to use isotope-induced nuclear symmetry breaking to control the\noutcome of light-molecule interactions across ultrafast timescales.",

Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and\nmanually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across\ndiverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource\nefficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework\nthat enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a\nredundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination\nof block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on\nfive public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and\nsix efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight\nvariant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU\nmemory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%\nacross all datasets.

    "abstract": "The electromagnetic structure of the nucleon can be determined from the\nscattering of electrons off a nucleon target. However, to study its axial\nstructure, neutrino beams are required. The results from these experiments\nshould be extrapolated to zero energy-momentum transfers to access the static\nproperties of the nucleon. For baryons with strange quarks, hyperons, the\nstatic limit can instead be approached in semi-leptonic decays, which give\ndirect access to the weak magnetism and axial-vector coupling strengths that\nare inaccessible in electromagnetic interactions. The axial-vector coupling as\nwhile weak magnetism coupling and the overall normalization, given by form\nfactor $f_1$, are being determined with increased precision from the theory of\nstrong interactions using a first principles formulation on the space--time\nlattice. Furthermore, the probability of the semi-leptonic hyperon decay is\napproximately proportional to $|V_{us}|^2\\cdot (f_1^2+3g_1^2)$, where $V_{us}$\nis the CKM matrix element responsible for the transition between an $s$ and a\n$u$ quark. Current determinations of $|V_{us}|$ come from kaon decays, but the\nresults are not consistent and could indicate a deviation from CKM matrix\nunitarity, a tell-tale sign of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) of\nelementary particles. Here we determine the absolute branching fraction and\nweak coupling strengths for $\\Lambda\\to p e^-\\bar\\nu_e$, and $\\bar \\Lambda\\to\n\\bar p e^+\\nu_e$. These observables combined with form factors determined from\nfirst-principle lattice QCD calculations allow for the extraction of the\n$|V_{us}|$ value. We demonstrate how $|V_{us}|$ can be extracted with\nincreasing sensitivity using polarized hyperons from entangled,\nbaryon-antibaryon pairs, thus enabling a complementary road to that of meson\ndecays. In addition, the presented experimental method can be used for other\nsemileptonic decays of baryons.",

    "abstract": "In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)\nface a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it\ndifficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus\non creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional\nreinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by\nusing Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we\nidentify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude\nof policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to\ninefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially\ndestabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose\nEntropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the\nlearning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG\namplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,\nand attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We\nfurther introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to\nfind more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on\nthree challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we\ndemonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly\noutperforms strong policy gradient baselines.

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) signal cleaning has long been a critical\nchallenge in the research community. The presence of artifacts can\nsignificantly degrade EEG data quality, complicating analysis and potentially\nleading to erroneous interpretations. While various artifact rejection methods\nhave been proposed, the gold standard remains manual visual inspection by human\nexperts-a process that is time-consuming, subjective, and impractical for\nlarge-scale EEG studies. Existing techniques are often hindered by a strong\nreliance on manual hyperparameter tuning, sensitivity to outliers, and high\ncomputational costs. In this paper, we introduce the improved Riemannian Potato\nField (iRPF), a fast and fully automated method for EEG artifact rejection that\naddresses key limitations of current approaches. We evaluate iRPF against\nseveral state-of-the-art artifact rejection methods, using two publicly\navailable EEG databases, labeled for various artifact types, comprising 226 EEG\nrecordings. Our results demonstrate that iRPF outperforms all competitors\nacross multiple metrics, with gains of up to 22% in recall, 102% in\nspecificity, 54% in precision, and 24% in F1-score, compared to Isolation\nForest, Autoreject, Riemannian Potato, and Riemannian Potato Field,\nrespectively. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these\nimprovements (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.8) in most\ncomparisons. Additionally, on a typical EEG recording iRPF performs artifact\ncleaning in under 8 milliseconds per epoch using a standard laptop,\nhighlighting its efficiency for large-scale EEG data processing and real-time\napplications. iRPF offers a robust and data-driven artifact rejection solution\nfor high-quality EEG pre-processing in brain-computer interfaces and clinical\nneuroimaging applications.",

    "abstract": "Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal\nreasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform\nframe sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.\nHowever, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to\ncritical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,\nwe propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal\nawareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a\nsemantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.\nSpecifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp\ntokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further\nreformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and\nintroduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal\ncoverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with\nthe vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally\nregularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.\nabsolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in\nstate-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video\nbenchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some\nbenchmarks.",

To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first\nlarge-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic\nX-ray interpretation.

Quantum computing provides a promising pathway to overcome this\nbarrier by enabling efficient simulation of quantum dynamics. However, for\nnear-term quantum devices with limited coherence times and fidelity, the deep\nquantum circuits required to implement time-evolution operators present a\nsignificant challenge for practical applications. In this work, we introduce an\nefficient algorithm for computing Green's functions via Cartan decomposition,\nwhich requires only fixed-depth quantum circuits for arbitrarily long time\nsimulations. Additionally, analytical gradients are formulated to accelerate\nthe Cartan decomposition by leveraging a unitary transformation in a factorized\nform. The new algorithm is applied to simulate long-time Green's functions for\nthe Fermi-Hubbard and transverse-field Ising models, extracting the spectral\nfunctions through Fourier transformation.",

    "abstract": "Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to\nprevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the\ndiagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations\nlabor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings\nmay be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These\nlimitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods\nfor gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named\nCoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The\nmodel is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers\nwith enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block\nAttention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction\nthrough channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled\nto achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification\nperformance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,\nHMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary\nclassification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved\n96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%\nAUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%\nprecision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all\nCNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.\nConclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for\nhistopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing\nperformance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist\npathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.",

    "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical\nimage analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks\nwithout retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain\nlimited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve\nhigh-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no\nunified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation\nand enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL\nin medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \\textbf{Medverse}, a\nuniversal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering\ndiverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement\nacross multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse\nemploys a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that\nprogressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,\nfull-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical\nawareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that\nfacilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while\npreserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is\nextensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering\npreviously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.\nResults demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL\nbaselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and\nmodel weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available\nat https://github.com/jiesihu/Medverse.",

Methods: We utilized a publicly available longitudinal OCT dataset at\nfive stages (preoperative, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). A stage\nspecific segmentation model delineated related structures, and an automated\npipeline extracted quantitative, composite, qualitative, and dynamic features.\nBinary logistic regression models, constructed with and without dynamic\nparameters, assessed their incremental predictive value for best-corrected\nvisual acuity (BCVA). A multimodal DL model combining clinical variables,\nOCT-derived features, and raw OCT images was developed and benchmarked against\nregression models. Results: The segmentation model achieved high accuracy\nacross all timepoints (mean Dice > 0.89). Univariate and multivariate analyses\nidentified base diameter, ellipsoid zone integrity, and macular hole area as\nsignificant BCVA predictors (P < 0.05). Incorporating dynamic recovery rates\nconsistently improved logistic regression AUC, especially at the 3-month\nfollow-up. The multimodal DL model outperformed logistic regression, yielding\nhigher AUCs and overall accuracy at each stage. The difference is as high as\n0.12, demonstrating the complementary value of raw image volume and dynamic\nparameters.

QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to\ncollect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students,\nthereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from\nundermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two\ncategories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:\n(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer\nthe QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based\non the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain\nknowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction.

Recently, two LPT sources, ILT\nJ1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37, with periods of 2-3 hours has been confirmed\nto originate from white dwarf (WD) -- M dwarf (MD) binaries. In this work, we\npropose that at least some LPTs originate from the magnetic WD -- MD binaries\nin the pre-polar phase. The asynchronism between the WD's rotation and the\nbinary's orbital motion allows for the unipolar-inductor mechanism or\nmagnetosphere interaction to operate and accelerate radiating particles, with\nthe dominant process depending on the magnetic moment ratio of the two stars.\nUnder asynchronism condition, both the peak flux and the polarization of radio\npulses will be modulated by the beat period. The pre-polar phase characterized\nby an extremely low accretion rate provides the relatively clean magnetospheric\nenvironment necessary for a loss-cone-driven maser (LCDM) mechanism to operate,\nproducing the LPT emission. The observed pulse duty cycle of $10^{-3}-10^{-1}$\nis attributed to a beaming effect modulated by the binary's magnetic geometry.\nFurthermore, the magnetized environment of a WD--MD binary is conducive to\nFaraday conversion with weak coupling, which implies that the polarization\nstate of LPTs should vary significantly at different periods. Finally, we\npredict that LPTs from WD--MD binaries should exhibit a period distribution\nfollowing $f_P(P)dP \\propto P^{-(1.67-2.33)}dP$ and a luminosity function\ndescribed by $f_L(L)dL \\propto L^{-(1.80-2.67)}dL$, which can be tested by the\nfuture large sample.",

We\nintroduce the Perceptual Separation (PS) and Perceptual Match (PM), the first\npair of measures that functionally isolate these two factors. Our intrusive\nmethod begins with generating a bank of fundamental distortions for each\nreference waveform signal in the mixture. Distortions, references, and their\nrespective system outputs from all sources are then independently encoded by a\npre-trained self-supervised learning model. These representations are\naggregated and projected onto a manifold via diffusion maps, which aligns\nEuclidean distances on the manifold with dissimilarities of the encoded\nwaveforms. On this manifold, the PM measures the Mahalanobis distance from each\noutput to its attributed cluster that consists of its reference and distortions\nembeddings, capturing self-distortion. The PS accounts for the Mahalanobis\ndistance of the output to the attributed and to the closest non-attributed\nclusters, quantifying leakage. Both measures are differentiable and granular,\noperating at a resolution as low as 50 frames per second. We further derive,\nfor both measures, deterministic error radius and non-asymptotic,\nhigh-probability confidence intervals (CIs). Experiments on English, Spanish,\nand music mixtures show that the PS and PM nearly always achieve the highest\nlinear correlation coefficients with human mean-opinion scores than 14\ncompetitors, reaching as high as 86.36% for speech and 87.21% for music. We\nobserve, at worst, an error radius of 1.39% and a probabilistic 95% CI of\n12.21% for these coefficients, which improves reliable and informed evaluation.\nUsing mutual information, the measures complement each other most as their\nvalues decrease, suggesting they are jointly more informative as system\nperformance degrades.",

In the SP\nmodel, by assuming that some atoms composing amorphous dust are trapped in a\ndouble-well potential (DWP) described by a quartic function, the electric\ninteraction can be solved directly, allowing the absorption cross-section of\nthe amorphous dust to be calculated. We present numerical and analytical\nsolutions for the absorption cross-section of amorphous dust and compare these\nresults, finding good agreement for the DWP with a sufficiently high potential\nbarrier. Our findings show that the SP model can reproduce the observed\nspectrum of the Perseus molecular cloud with slightly better accuracy than the\nconventional TLS model.

The models exhibit\nstable late-time de-Sitter solutions, ensuring ghost-free evolution, with the\nHubble constant in the range $H_0 \\sim 67$--$70$ km/s/Mpc.",

    "abstract": "Universal audio codecs learn entangled representations across audio types,\nwhereas some specific codecs offer decoupled representations but are limited to\nspeech. Real-world audio, however, often contains mixed speech and background\nsounds, and downstream tasks require selective access to these components.\nTherefore, we rethink the audio codec as a universal disentangled\nrepresentation learner to enable controllable feature selection across\ndifferent audio tasks. To this end, we introduce DeCodec, a novel neural codec\nthat learns to decouple audio representations into orthogonal subspaces\ndedicated to speech and background sound, and within speech, representations\nare further decomposed into semantic and paralinguistic components. This\nhierarchical disentanglement allows flexible feature selection, making DeCodec\na universal front-end for multiple audio applications. Technically, built upon\na codec framework, DeCodec incorporates two key innovations: a subspace\northogonal projection module that factorizes the input into two decoupled\northogonal subspaces, and a representation swap training procedure that ensures\nthese two subspaces are correlate to the speech and background sound,\nrespectively. These allows parallel RVQs to quantize speech and background\nsound components independently. Furthermore, we employ semantic guidance to the\nspeech RVQ to achieve semantic and paralinguistic decomposition. Experimental\nresults show that DeCodec maintains advanced signal reconstruction while\nenabling new capabilities: superior speech enhancement and effective one-shot\nvoice conversion on noisy speech via representation recombination, improved ASR\nrobustness through clean semantic features, and controllable background sound\npreservation/suppression in TTS.

    "abstract": "Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and\nautonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal\nguidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and\nleveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction\ntask into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion\nbased on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:\ncoarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while\nfine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all\nfuture timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity\nremains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory\nmodeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations\ncapture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively\nintegrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In\nthis paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for\nhuman Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals\nfrom coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based\nrecursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive\nrefinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a\nweight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary\ntask to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in\nEHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline\nmethods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.",

If the\nfull word (\"Bonham\") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those\nearlier bonuses.

To\novercome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and\npredict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by\nbetter estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of\nthe full rare word.

We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression\nTasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric\nforecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields\noptimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs\ndual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,\nphysically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present\nfour key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap\nacross multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the \"IVT Paradox\", removing\nIntegrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric\nriver analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)\narchitectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART\nachieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent\nCSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding\ndisaster as a case study.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming indispensable tools for\nsoftware developers, assisting or even partnering with them in crafting complex\nprograms. The advantages are evident -- LLMs can significantly reduce\ndevelopment time, generate well-organized and comprehensible code, and\noccasionally suggest innovative ideas that developers might not conceive on\ntheir own. However, despite their strengths, LLMs will often introduce\nsignificant errors and present incorrect code with persuasive confidence,\npotentially misleading developers into accepting flawed solutions.\n  In order to bring LLMs into the software development cycle in a more reliable\nmanner, we propose a methodology for combining them with ``traditional''\nsoftware engineering techniques in a structured way, with the goal of\nstreamlining the development process, reducing errors, and enabling users to\nverify crucial program properties with increased confidence. Specifically, we\nfocus on the Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm -- an event-driven,\nscenario-based approach for software engineering -- to allow human developers\nto pour their expert knowledge into the LLM, as well as to inspect and verify\nits outputs.\n  To evaluate our methodology, we conducted a significant case study, and used\nit to design and implement the Connect4 game. By combining LLMs and SBP we were\nable to create a highly-capable agent, which could defeat various strong\nexisting agents. Further, in some cases, we were able to formally verify the\ncorrectness of our agent. Finally, our experience reveals interesting insights\nregarding the ease-of-use of our proposed approach.

Their radiation hardness is monitored as a\npart of the production quality control. Dedicated test structures from each\nwafer are irradiated with neutrons and a fast and comprehensive\ncharacterization is required. We introduce a new test method based on Transient\nCurrent Technique (TCT) performed in the interface region of two LGAD devices.\nThe measurement enables extraction of numerous sensor performance parameters,\nsuch as LGAD gain layer depletion voltage, LGAD gain dependence on bias\nvoltage, sensor leakage current and effective interpad distance. Complementary\ncapacitance-voltage measurements and charge collection measurements with 90Sr\non the same samples have been performed to calibrate the TCT results in terms\nof charge collection and define acceptance criteria for wafer radiation\nhardness in the ATLAS-HGTD project.",

    "abstract": "In today's dynamic cyber threat landscape, organizations must take proactive\nsteps to bolster their cybersecurity defenses. Cyber threat hunting is a\nproactive and iterative process aimed at identifying and mitigating advanced\nthreats that may go undetected by traditional security measures. Rather than\nwaiting for automated security systems to flag potential threats, threat\nhunting involves actively searching for signs of malicious activity within an\norganization's network. In this paper, we present the Forensic Visualization\nToolkit, a powerful tool designed for digital forensics investigations,\nanalysis of digital evidence, and advanced visualizations to enhance\ncybersecurity situational awareness and risk management and empower security\nanalysts with an intuitive and interactive tool. Through practical, real-world\nscenarios, we demonstrate how FVT significantly amplifies the capabilities of\ncybersecurity professionals, enabling them to effectively identify, analyze,\nand respond to threats. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that FVT has\nbeen integrated into, utilized, and continually enhanced within various\nEU-funded research projects over recent years.",

Our results show that electronic correlations\ncan significantly modify the electronic structure, even driving surface layers\ninto a Mott-insulating state with a 3$d^8$ electronic configuration. Moreover,\nsurface termination effects induce a polar field that can shift the $\\Gamma$\nand $A$ pocket above the Fermi level, even for the undoped parent compound\nNdNiO$_2$.

    "abstract": "Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but\nremains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have\nshown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing\napproaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex\nframeworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image\nSignal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW\nimages in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object\ndetection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP\npipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone\nmapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized\nthrough task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware\nadaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB\nconversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP\npipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that\nfacilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on\nthree RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior\nresults with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.",

Building on this framework, we\npropose a quantile-based variant, the quantile fractional generalized\ncumulative past entropy (QFGCPE), along with its dynamic time-dependent\ncounterpart (DQFGCPE). Closed-form expressions of these measures are derived\nanalytically for a variety of lifetime distributions, including those with and\nwithout explicit distribution functions. Fundamental properties such as bounds,\nmonotonicity, and stochastic orderings are investigated to assess robustness\nand interpretability. Furthermore, we construct a nonparametric estimator of\nQFGCPE and establish its asymptotic validity through extensive simulation\nstudies involving bias, mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error\n(RMSE). Finally, the sensitivity of the proposed QFGCPE measure is examined by\ncomparing its behavior with the logistic map, demonstrating its ability to\ncapture transitions from order to chaos.",

    "abstract": "Indirect reciprocity promotes cooperation by allowing individuals to help\nothers based on reputation rather than direct reciprocation. Because it relies\non accurate reputation information, its effectiveness can be undermined by\ninformation gaps. We examine two forms of incomplete information: incomplete\nobservation, in which donor actions are observed only probabilistically, and\nreputation fading, in which recipient reputations are sometimes classified as\n\"Unknown\". Using analytical frameworks for public assessment, we show that\nthese seemingly similar models yield qualitatively different outcomes. Under\nincomplete observation, the conditions for cooperation are unchanged, because\nless frequent updates are exactly offset by higher reputational stakes. In\ncontrast, reputation fading hinders cooperation, requiring higher\nbenefit-to-cost ratios as the identification probability decreases. We then\nevaluate costly punishment as a third action alongside cooperation and\ndefection. Norms incorporating punishment can sustain cooperation across\nbroader parameter ranges without reducing efficiency in the reputation fading\nmodel. This contrasts with previous work, which found punishment ineffective\nunder a different type of information limitation, and highlights the importance\nof distinguishing between types of information constraints. Finally, we review\npast studies to identify when punishment is effective and when it is not in\nindirect reciprocity.",
