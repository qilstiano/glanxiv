Stable CDW structures are obtained through atomic\nreconstruction driven by soft-mode distortions and lithiation, respectively,\nlead to significant electronic modifications that suppress the CDW order. This\nsuppression is attributed to anisotropic atomic distortions, along with a\nreduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level. As a result,\nthe electron--phonon coupling strength is suppressed, particularly in the\nlithiated structure, due to reduced contributions from low-frequency phonons,\nprimarily associated with in-plane Nb vibrations. Finally, we observe a sizable\nanisotropy in the superconducting gap on the Fermi surface, with a\nsuperconducting transition temperature of approximately 8~K in the distorted,\nand 4~K in the lithiated, CDW NbSe$_2$ monolayer.",

However, whether such beam focusing can fully eliminate\ninterference under perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI),\nrendering advanced interference management schemes unnecessary, remains an open\nquestion. To address this, we investigate rate-splitting multiple access\n(RSMA)-enabled near-field communications (NFC) under imperfect SCI. Our\ntransmit scheme employs a sub-connected hybrid analog-digital (HAD)\narchitecture to reduce hardware overhead while incorporating imperfect\nsuccessive interference cancellation (SIC) for practical implementation. A\nminimum rate maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the\nanalog beamfocuser, the digital beamfocuser, and the common rate allocation. To\nsolve the non-convex problem, we develop a penalty-based block coordinate\ndescent (BCD) algorithm, deriving closed-form expressions for the optimal\nanalog and digital beamfocusers solutions. Furthermore, to reduce computational\ncomplexity, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, where analog and digital\nbeamfocusers are designed in two separate stages. Simulation results underscore\nthat: 1) beamfocusing alone is insufficient to fully suppress interference even\nunder perfect CSI; 2) RSMA exhibits superior interference management over SDMA\nunder imperfect CSI and SIC conditions; 3) sub-connected HAD architecture\ndelivers near-optimal digital beamfocusing performance with fewer radio\nfrequency chains.",

    "abstract": "The development of advanced packaging is essential in the semiconductor\nmanufacturing industry. However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced\npackaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of\nthe layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables\nthe imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective\nin NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This\nconversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for\nmagnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy\ncurrent effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we\npresent a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample\nscanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy.\nThe SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by\naligning all the \"sharp\" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect\nusing both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii)\nmagnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment\nof the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an\ninversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by\nintegrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM\nimproves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%.\nAlso, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a\nreal image. Overall, SPIM highlights the potential of combining spatial\nanalysis with physics-driven models in practical applications.",

Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient\nway for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their\ngenes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the\nworkload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic\nprediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the\nmodels to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids,\nwhich remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we\nproposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice\nbreeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally\nensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual\nprojection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual\nanalysis.

Unlike previous studies in\nthe literature, we consider contributions to nucleon decays from a complete set\nof dimension-eight BNV aLEFT operators involving light $u,\\,d,\\,s$ quarks. We\nperform the chiral irreducible representation (irrep) decomposition of all\nthose interactions under the QCD chiral group $\\rm SU(3)_{\\tt L}\\times\nSU(3)_{\\tt R}$, and match them onto the recently developed chiral framework to\nobtain nucleon-level effective interactions among the ALP, octet baryons, and\noctet pseudoscalar mesons.

We\nthen analyze the momentum distributions for the three-body modes and find that\nthe operators belonging to the newly identified chiral irreps $\\pmb{6}_{\\tt\nL(R)}\\times \\pmb{3}_{\\tt R(L)}$ exhibit markedly different behavior compared to\nthat in the usual irreps $\\pmb{8}_{\\tt L(R)}\\times \\pmb{1}_{\\tt R(L)}$ and\n$\\pmb{3}_{\\tt L(R)}\\times \\bar{\\pmb{3}}_{\\tt R(L)}$.

Our recasting constraints are\nseveral orders of magnitude more stringent than the inclusive bounds used in\nthe literature.

However, existing numerical abstract\ninterpreters rely on hand-crafted, instruction-specific transformers tailored\nto each domain, with no general algorithm for handling common operations across\ndomains. This limits extensibility, prevents precise compositional reasoning\nover instruction sequences, and forces all downstream tasks to use the same\nfixed transformer regardless of their precision, efficiency, or task-specific\nrequirements. To address these limitations, we propose a universal transformer\nsynthesis algorithm that constructs a parametric family of sound abstract\ntransformers for any given polyhedral numerical domain and a concrete operator\nfrom the class of Quadratic-Bounded Guarded Operators (QGO), which includes\nboth individual instructions and structured sequences. Each instantiation in\nthis family is sound by construction, enabling downstream analyses to adapt the\ntransformer to their particular needs. The space of transformers is\ndifferentiable but complex. To efficiently explore this space of transformers,\nwe introduce the Adaptive Gradient Guidance (AGG) procedure, a gradient-guided\nsearch strategy that steers the search process based on downstream analysis\nobjectives and runtime constraints. We implement these ideas in the USTAD\nframework and evaluate their effectiveness across three numerical abstract\ndomains: Zones, Octagons, and Polyhedra. Our results demonstrate that the\nuniversal synthesis algorithm successfully constructs sound families of\ntransformers across domains, and that USTAD achieves significant, tunable\nprecision gains over baselines by leveraging compositional reasoning and\nefficient gradient-guided traversal of the transformer space.",

    "abstract": "Turbulence holds immense importance across various scientific and engineering\ndisciplines. The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by\nOrszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of\nnumerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that\nturbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very\nsensitive to small disturbance. In 2006 E.D. Lorenz discovered that numerical\nnoise might have a great influence on statistic characteristics of chaotic\nsystems. The above-mentioned facts logically lead to the conclusion that\nnumerical noises of turbulence (as a chaotic system) might have great influence\non turbulent flows. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov\nturbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than\nDNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS\ncan greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required\nsmall level so that artificial numerical noise can be rigorously negligible\nthroughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In\nphysics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence, as pointed out\nby Nobel Prize winner T.D. Lee. So, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent\nKolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with\nthat given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal\ntrajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are badly\npolluted by artificial numerical noise rather quickly, and the DNS result has\nhuge deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the flow field and\nthe energy cascade but also even in statistics.",

    "abstract": "Research experience is crucial for computing master's students pursuing\nacademic and scientific careers, yet online students have traditionally been\nexcluded from these opportunities due to the physical constraints of\ntraditional research environments. This paper presents the Framework for\nAccelerating Interdisciplinary Research in Computer Science (FAIR-CS), a method\nfor achieving research goals, developing research communities, and supporting\nhigh quality mentorship in an online research environment. This method advances\nvirtual research operations by orchestrating dynamic partnerships between\nmaster's level researchers and academic mentors, resulting in interdisciplinary\npublications. We then discuss the implementation of FAIR-CS in the\nHuman-Augmented Analytics Group (HAAG), with researchers from the Georgia\nTech's Online Master of Computer Science program. Through documented project\nrecords and experiences with 72 active users, we present our lessons learned\nand evaluate the evolution of FAIR-CS in HAAG. This paper serves as a\ncomprehensive resource for other institutions seeking to establish similar\nvirtual research initiatives, demonstrating how the traditional research lab\nenvironment can be effectively replicated in the virtual space while\nmaintaining robust collaborative relationships and supporting knowledge\ntransfer.",

In the past two versions of this\nequation were investigated. The more commonly used standard form described a\npitch-angle isotropization process but does not conserve the norm. In the\ncurrent paper we consider the focused transport equation in conservative form\nalso called modified focused transport equation. This equation conserves the\nnorm but does not describe pitch-angle isotropization. We use the previously\ndeveloped subspace method to solve the focused transport equation analytically\nand numerically. For a pure analytical treatment we employ the two-dimensional\nsubspace approximation. Furthermore, we consider a higher dimensionality for\nwhich one needs to evaluate occurring matrix exponentials numerically. This\ntype of semi-numerical approach is much faster than traditional solvers and,\ntherefore, it is very useful.",

We introduce the monopole-interaction-based truncation and seniority\ntruncation strategies, designed to reduce the dimension of the calculations.\nThese truncations can be established by considering certain partitions based on\ntheir importance and selecting physically meaningful states.

Photospheric current\nhelicity, defined as the integral of the product of vertical electric current\ndensity and vertical magnetic field ($H_c=\\int j_zB_z\\ dS$), serves as a key\nparameter in understanding the eruptions. Using a 3D magnetohydrodynamic model,\nwe identify a current helicity reversal pattern associated with the eruption: a\npre-eruption decrease and a post-eruption increase. This helicity reversal is\nattributed to the redistribution of electric currents: before the eruption,\ncurrents concentrate toward the polarity inversion line (PIL); after the\neruption they move away from the PIL, consistent with the flare ribbon\nseparation, which is caused by the upward progression reconnection site. To\nvalidate this pattern, we conducted an observational analysis of 50 $\\geq$M5.0\neruptive flares. The results reveal that 58\\% of cases exhibited a pre-eruption\ndecrease and 92\\% showed the post-eruption increase in current helicity.\nDetailed analysis of two cases with this reversal suggests that they share the\nsame current redistribution pattern, consistent with the mechanism identified\nin the simulations. Moreover, the pre-eruption decrease could be observed\nclearly even in the long-term evolution of the two cases.

We have developed a public tool to predict kilonova\nlight curves using simulated low-latency alert data from the International\nGravitational Wave Network during observing runs 4 (O4) and 5 (O5). It uses a\nbidirectional long-short-term memory (LSTM) model to forecast kilonova light\ncurves from binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers in the\nZwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space\nand Time filters. The model achieves a test mean squared error (MSE) of 0.19\nfor ZTF filters and 0.22 for Rubin filters, calculated by averaging the squared\nerror over all time steps, filters, and light curves in the test set. We verify\nthe performance of the model against merger events followed-up by the ZTF\npartnership during O4a and O4b. We also analyze the effect of incorporating\nskymaps and constraints on physical features such as ejecta mass through a\nhybrid convolutional neural network and LSTM model. Using ejecta mass, the\nperformance of the model improves to an MSE of 0.1. However, using full skymap\ninformation results in slightly lower model performance.

The\ninability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their\nover-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards\ngeneral-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models\n(EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the\nreal-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research\nprogress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of\nfirst-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end,\nthis study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their\nmethodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that\nmost EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on\ntransformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for\nself-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely\nlimited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility.\nIn addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work\nshould demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and\ntrustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline.

    "abstract": "Constructing confidence intervals for the value of an optimal treatment\npolicy is an important problem in causal inference. Insight into the optimal\npolicy value can guide the development of reward-maximizing, individualized\ntreatment regimes. However, because the functional that defines the optimal\nvalue is non-differentiable, standard semi-parametric approaches for performing\ninference fail to be directly applicable. Existing approaches for handling this\nnon-differentiability fall roughly into two camps. In one camp are estimators\nbased on constructing smooth approximations of the optimal value. These\napproaches are computationally lightweight, but typically place unrealistic\nparametric assumptions on outcome regressions. In another camp are approaches\nthat directly de-bias the non-smooth objective. These approaches don't place\nparametric assumptions on nuisance functions, but they either require the\ncomputation of intractably-many nuisance estimates, assume unrealistic\n$L^\\infty$ nuisance convergence rates, or make strong margin assumptions that\nprohibit non-response to a treatment. In this paper, we revisit the problem of\nconstructing smooth approximations of non-differentiable functionals. By\ncarefully controlling first-order bias and second-order remainders, we show\nthat a softmax smoothing-based estimator can be used to estimate parameters\nthat are specified as a maximum of scores involving nuisance components. In\nparticular, this includes the value of the optimal treatment policy as a\nspecial case. Our estimator obtains $\\sqrt{n}$ convergence rates, avoids\nparametric restrictions/unrealistic margin assumptions, and is often\nstatistically efficient.",

The model in [15] is a particle system,\nregulated at the left boundary point. The more general model of this paper is\nsuch that we allow regulation boundaries on either side, or both sides, or no\nregulation at all. We consider the mean-field asymptotic regime, when the\nnumber of particles $n$ and the job arrival rates go to infinity, while the job\narrival rates per particle remain constant. The results include: the\nexistence/uniqueness of fixed points of mean-field limits (ML), which describe\nthe limiting dynamics of the system; conditions for the steady-state asymptotic\nindependence (concentration, as $n \\to\\infty$, of the stationary distribution\non a single state, which is necessarily an ML fixed point); the limits, as $n\n\\to\\infty$, of the average velocity at which unregulated (free) particle system\nadvances. In particular, our results for the left-regulated system unify and\ngeneralize the corresponding results in [15].

The enhancement in the\nGamow-Teller (GT) transition strength in $^{70}$Br compared to the\n$\\beta$-decay of the lighter $^{62}$Ge was suggested as an indication for\nincreased neutron-proton ($np$) pairing correlation. To explore the $np$\ncorrelations in nuclei, we systematically examined the $\\beta$-decay properties\nof the even-even nuclei $A=58,62,66,$ and $70$ into $N=Z$ odd-odd nuclei. By\nemploying an interaction involving solely $J=1, T=0$ and $J=0, T=1$ pairing\nmatrix elements, we observe that the pairing does not necessarily lead to an\nenhancement in the GT strength for the same coupling strength. But with the\ninclusion of the $g_{9/2}$ orbital, the GT strength can be increased with\nincreasing $np$ pairing in connection with the enhanced contribution from the\n$g_{9/2}$ orbital. We further compare those results with realistic calculations\nin the $fp$ and $f_{5/2}pg_{9/2}$ model space to gauge the contribution from\n$f_{7/2}$ and $g_{9/2}$ orbitals in the GT strengths. With the JUN45\ninteraction, there is an increment for the yrast $1^+$ state for the decay of\n$^{70}$Kr as compared to the decay of $^{62}$Ge due to increased $g_{9/2}$\ncontribution. Additionally, we probe the effect of $np$ pairing on $B_{\\rm GT}$\nby modifying the single-particle energies and the $T = 0$ matrix elements of\nthe interaction responsible for the decay transition strength.

Since there is a limited amount of approaches in this\ndirection, in this work we deliver a general DP approach for CP that we call\nPrivate Conformity via Quantile Search (P-COQS). The proposed approach adapts\nan existing randomized binary search algorithm for computing DP quantiles in\nthe calibration phase of CP thereby guaranteeing privacy of the consequent\nprediction sets. This however comes at a price of slightly under-covering with\nrespect to the desired $(1 - \\alpha)$-level when using finite-sample\ncalibration sets (although broad empirical results show that the P-COQS\ngenerally targets the required level in the considered cases). Confirming\nproperties of the adapted algorithm and quantifying the approximate coverage\nguarantees of the consequent CP, we conduct extensive experiments to examine\nthe effects of privacy noise, sample size and significance level on the\nperformance of our approach compared to existing alternatives. In addition, we\nempirically evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, including\nCIFAR-10, ImageNet and CoronaHack. Our results suggest that the proposed method\nis robust to privacy noise and performs favorably with respect to the current\nDP alternative in terms of empirical coverage, efficiency, and informativeness.\nSpecifically, the results indicate that P-COQS produces smaller conformal\nprediction sets while simultaneously targeting the desired coverage and privacy\nguarantees in all these experimental settings.",

Recently, generative machine learning methods have emerged as a\npromising, more efficient method than molecular dynamics for sampling of\nconformations from the Boltzmann distribution. In this paper, we introduce\nTorsional-GFN, a conditional GFlowNet specifically designed to sample\nconformations of molecules proportionally to their Boltzmann distribution,\nusing only a reward function as training signal. Conditioned on a molecular\ngraph and its local structure (bond lengths and angles), Torsional-GFN samples\nrotations of its torsion angles. Our results demonstrate that Torsional-GFN is\nable to sample conformations approximately proportional to the Boltzmann\ndistribution for multiple molecules with a single model, and allows for\nzero-shot generalization to unseen bond lengths and angles coming from the MD\nsimulations for such molecules. Our work presents a promising avenue for\nscaling the proposed approach to larger molecular systems, achieving zero-shot\ngeneralization to unseen molecules, and including the generation of the local\nstructure into the GFlowNet model.",

In medical imaging, where modalities like brain MRI contain strong\nanatomical priors, this choice is non-trivial. This paper presents the first\nsystematic study of how scan order impacts MRI segmentation. We introduce\nMulti-Scan 2D (MS2D), a parameter-free module for Mamba-based architectures\nthat facilitates exploring diverse scan paths without additional computational\ncost. We conduct a large-scale benchmark of 21 scan strategies on three public\ndatasets (BraTS 2020, ISLES 2022, LGG), covering over 70,000 slices. Our\nanalysis shows conclusively that scan order is a statistically significant\nfactor (Friedman test: $\\chi^{2}_{20}=43.9, p=0.0016$), with performance\nvarying by as much as 27 Dice points. Spatially contiguous paths -- simple\nhorizontal and vertical rasters -- consistently outperform disjointed diagonal\nscans.

In many situations these sequences are generated by slowly converging\niterative procedures and this led practitioners to seek faster alternatives to\nreach the limit. ``Acceleration techniques'' comprise a broad array of methods\nspecifically designed with this goal in mind. They started as a means of\nimproving the convergence of general scalar sequences by various forms of\n``extrapolation to the limit'', i.e., by extrapolating the most recent iterates\nto the limit via linear combinations. Extrapolation methods of this type, the\nbest known example of which is Aitken's Delta-squared process, require only the\nsequence of vectors as input. However, limiting methods to only use the\niterates is too restrictive. Accelerating sequences generated by fixed-point\niterations by utilizing both the iterates and the fixed-point mapping itself\nhas proven highly successful across various areas of physics. A notable example\nof these Fixed-Point accelerators (FP-Accelerators) is a method developed by D.\nAnderson in 1965 and now widely known as Anderson Acceleration (AA).\nFurthermore, Quasi-Newton and Inexact Newton methods can also be placed in this\ncategory as well.

    "abstract": "The donation game is a well-established framework for studying the emergence\nand evolution of cooperation in multi-agent systems. The cooperative behavior\ncan be influenced by the environmental noise in partially observable settings\nand by the decision-making strategies of agents, which may incorporate not only\nreputation but also traits such as generosity and forgiveness. Traditional\nsimulations often assume fully random interactions, where cooperation is tested\nbetween randomly selected agent pairs. In this paper, we investigate\ncooperation dynamics using the concept of Stephen Wolfram's one-dimensional\nbinary cellular automata. This approach allows us to explore how cooperation\nevolves when interactions are limited to neighboring agents. We define binary\ncellular automata rules that conform to the donation game mechanics.\nAdditionally, we introduce models of perceptual and action noise, along with a\nmutation matrix governing the probabilistic evolution of agent strategies. Our\nempirical results demonstrate that cooperation is significantly affected by\nagents' mobility and their spatial locality on the game board. These findings\nhighlight the importance of distinguishing between entirely random multi-agent\nsystems and those in which agents are more likely to interact with their\nnearest neighbors.",

Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel\nsynthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a\nlimited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for\ndiversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key\ninsight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong\ncorrectness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such\nguarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse\nformulations.

Various approaches have been developed to\nloosen the axioms, of which the use of signed measures is the most successful\n(e.g. the Wigner quasiprobability distribution). As part of our larger effort\nAssumptions of Physics, we have been considering the various roles of measures,\nwhich are used in physics not only for probability, but also to quantify the\ncount of possible states and configurations. These measures play a crucial role\nin classical mechanics, as they effectively define its geometric structure. If\none tries to construct a parallel in quantum mechanics, the measure to quantify\nthe count of states turns out to be non-additive. The proper extension of\nprobability calculus may require the use of non-additive measures, which is\nsomething that, to our knowledge, has not yet been explored. The purpose of\nthis paper is to present the general idea and the open problems to an audience\nthat is knowledgeable of the subject of non-additive set functions, though not\nnecessarily in quantum physics, in the hope that it will spark helpful\ndiscussions. We go through the motivation in simple terms, which stems from the\nlink between the entropy of a uniform distribution and the logarithm of the\nmeasure associated to its support. If one extends this notion to quantum\nmechanics, the associated measure is non-additive. We will explore some\nproperties of this \"quantum measure\", its reasonableness in terms of the\nphysics, but its peculiarity on the math side. We will explore the need for a\nset of properties that can properly characterize the measure and a\ngeneralization of the Radon-Nikodym derivative to define a properly extended\nprobability calculus that reduces to the standard additive one on sets of\nphysically distinguishable cases (i.e. orthogonal measurement outcomes).",

This study presents the\nfirst dedicated economic assessment of geomagnetic storm impacts on Aotearoa\nNew Zealand, quantifying potential GDP losses across seven disruption and\nmitigation scenarios due to an extreme coronal mass ejection (CME). The primary\nfocus is upon the damaging impacts of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs)\non the electrical power transmission network. The goal is to support\ndecision-making around space weather mitigation investments by providing a\nfirst-order approximation of their potential economic benefits. We find that in\nthe absence of mitigation, a severe but realistic storm could result in up to\nNZ\\$8.36 billion in lost GDP, with more than half stemming from cascading\nsupply chain effects. Yet, even less severe scenarios incur losses exceeding\nNZ\\$3 billion. Importantly, research-led operational strategies, such as\noptimized switching and islanding, can avoid up to NZ\\$370 million in losses\nfor as little as NZ\\$500,000 in expenditure, delivering a benefit-cost ratio of\n740 to 1. Moreover, physical protections such as GIC blocking devices further\nreduce disruption to as low as NZ\\$1.12 billion, with avoided GDP losses up to\nNZ\\$2.3 billion, and benefit-cost returns up to 80 to 1.

This paper demonstrates that Picat's features, especially its\nSAT-based constraint solving and tabling, enable concise, declarative, and\nhighly efficient implementations of problems that would require significantly\nmore effort in imperative languages.",

Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines\nexcel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor\nscenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise.

    "abstract": "Forecasting load in power transmission networks is essential across various\nhierarchical levels, from the system level down to individual points of\ndelivery (PoD). While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local\nforecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in\nhandling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem.\nThese methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally\nexpensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In\ncontrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance\nprediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through\nglobalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load\nforecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of\ndifferent modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore\nfeature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how\nglobalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In\naddition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its\npotential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the\nbalance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series\nclustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming\nmodels and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models.\nThrough extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity\nload, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently\noutperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global\nfeatures and clustering techniques. In contrast, global feature-transforming\nmodels face challenges in balancing local and global dynamics, often requiring\nTSC to manage data heterogeneity effectively.",

    "abstract": "Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) enables continuous measurement of\nblood pressure and heart rate over 24 hours and is increasingly used in\nclinical studies. However, ABPM data are often reduced to summary statistics,\nsuch as means or medians, which obscure temporal features like nocturnal\ndipping and individual chronotypes. Functional data analysis methods better\ncapture these temporal dynamics but typically treat each ABPM measurement\nseparately, limiting their ability to leverage correlations among matched\nmeasurements. In this work, we observe that aligning ABPM data along\nmeasurement type, time, and patient ID lends itself to a tensor\nrepresentation--a multidimensional array. Although tensor learning has shown\ngreat potential in other fields, it has not been applied to ABPM data. Existing\ntensor learning approaches often lack temporal smoothing constraints, assume no\nmissing data, and can be computationally demanding. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel smooth tensor decomposition method that\nincorporates a temporal smoothing penalty and accommodates missing data. We\nalso develop an automatic procedure for selecting the optimal smoothing\nparameter and tensor ranks. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method\nreliably reconstructs smooth temporal trends from noisy, incomplete data.\nApplication to ABPM data from patients with concurrent obstructive sleep apnea\nand type 2 diabetes uncovers clinically relevant associations between patient\ncharacteristics and ABPM measurements, which are missed by summary-based\napproaches.",

This filtration on $u(M)$ is concentrated in negative degrees. In this\npaper, we give a description of the graded piece $Gr^F_{-1}u( M)$ in terms of\nthe extensions $F_{r+1}M/F_{r-1}M\\in Ext^1(Gr^F_{r+1}M, Gr^F_{r}M)$. In\nparticular, these extensions determine $Gr^F_{-1}u(M)$. Note that here we\nneither assume the filtration is functorial, nor we assume that $Gr^FM$ is\nsemisimple. The problem of studying $u(M)$ in this generality is motivated by\nthe desire to understand Tannakian groups associated to a mixed motive and its\nrealizations, including realizations for which semisimplicity of realizations\nof pure motives is not known and realizations that lack an interesting\nfunctorial weight filtration.\n  We also give two related applications. The first is an equivalent condition\nin the generality described above for when $u(M)$ coincides with its trivial\nupper bound $F_{-1}\\underline{Hom}(M,M)$. This result generalizes earlier\ncriteria for maximality of $u(M)$ obtained by various authors in special\ncontexts or under limiting conditions. In the second application, we apply the\nresults to the setting of a neutral Tannakian category with a functorial weight\nfiltration $W_\\bullet$. Combining the constructions of [arXiv:2307.15487] with\nour general maximality criterion we prove a result about the structure of the\nset of isomorphism classes of objects $M$ for which $Gr^WM$ is isomorphic to a\ngiven graded object $A$ and $u^W(M)=W_{-1}\\underline{Hom}(M,M)$.",

    "abstract": "As the global population of people with disabilities (PWD) continues to grow,\nso will the need for mobility solutions that promote independent living and\nsocial integration. Wheelchairs are vital for the mobility of PWD in both\nindoor and outdoor environments. The current SOTA in powered wheelchairs is\nbased on either manually controlled or fully autonomous modes of operation,\noffering limited flexibility and often proving difficult to navigate in\nspatially constrained environments. Moreover, research on robotic wheelchairs\nhas focused predominantly on complete autonomy or improved manual control;\napproaches that can compromise efficiency and user trust. To overcome these\nchallenges, this paper introduces the CoNav Chair, a smart wheelchair based on\nthe Robot Operating System (ROS) and featuring shared control navigation and\nobstacle avoidance capabilities that are intended to enhance navigational\nefficiency, safety, and ease of use for the user. The paper outlines the CoNav\nChair's design and presents a preliminary usability evaluation comparing three\ndistinct navigation modes, namely, manual, shared, and fully autonomous,\nconducted with 21 healthy, unimpaired participants traversing an indoor\nbuilding environment. Study findings indicated that the shared control\nnavigation framework had significantly fewer collisions and performed\ncomparably, if not superior to the autonomous and manual modes, on task\ncompletion time, trajectory length, and smoothness; and was perceived as being\nsafer and more efficient based on user reported subjective assessments of\nusability.

While\nthis approach itself is still in its infancy, and many obstacles must still be\novercome before its physical implementation, challenges from the software and\nalgorithmic side must also be identified and addressed. For instance, this\nparadigm shift requires a new form of compiler that considers the network\nconstraints in general as well as phenomena arising due to the nature of\nquantum communication. In distributed quantum computing, large circuits are\ndivided into smaller subcircuits such that they can be executed individually\nand simultaneously on multiple QPUs that are connected through quantum\nchannels. As quantum communication, for example, in the form of teleportation,\nis expensive, it must be used sparingly. We address the problem of assigning\nqubits to QPUs to minimize communication costs in two different ways. First by\napplying time-aware algorithms that take into account the changing connectivity\nof a given circuit as well as the underlying network topology. We define the\noptimization problem, use simulated annealing and an evolutionary algorithm and\ncompare the results to graph partitioning and sequential qubit assignment\nbaselines. In another approach, we propose an evolutionary-based quantum\ncircuit optimization algorithm that adjusts the circuit itself rather than the\nschedule to reduce the overall communication cost. We evaluate the techniques\nagainst random circuits and different network topologies. Both evolutionary\nalgorithms outperform the baseline in terms of communication cost reduction.

Next, we develop algorithms that\nachieve a regret bound of order $T^{2/3}$.

    "abstract": "Background: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become an essential design\ntool for ventricular assist devices (VADs), where the goal of maximizing\nperformance often conflicts with biocompatibility. This tradeoff becomes even\nmore pronounced in pediatric applications due to the stringent size constraints\nimposed by the smaller patient population. This study presents an automated\nCFD-driven shape optimization of a new intermediate diffuser stage for the\nPediaFlow pediatric VAD, positioned immediately downstream of the impeller to\nimprove pressure recovery.\n  Methods: We adopted a multi-objective optimization approach to maximize\npressure recovery while minimizing hemolysis. The proposed diffuser stage was\nisolated from the rest of the flow domain, enabling efficient evaluation of\nover 450 design variants using Sobol sequence, which yielded a Pareto front of\nnon-dominated solutions. The selected best candidate was further refined using\nlocal T-search algorithm. We then incorporated the optimized front diffuser\ninto the full pump for CFD verification and in vitro validation.\n  Results: We identified critical dependencies where longer blades increased\npressure recovery but also hemolysis, while the wrap angle showed a strong\nparabolic relationship with pressure recovery but a monotonic relationship with\nhemolysis. Counterintuitively, configurations with fewer blades (2-3)\nconsistently outperformed those with more blades (4-5) in both metrics. The\noptimized two-blade design enabled operation at lower pump speeds (14,000 vs\n16,000 RPM), improving hydraulic efficiency from 26.3% to 32.5% and reducing\nhemolysis by 31%.\n  Conclusion: This approach demonstrates that multi-objective CFD optimization\ncan systematically explore complex design spaces while balancing competing\npriorities of performance and hemocompatibility for pediatric VADs.",

Various\ndescriptions exist in the literature for modelling the surface manifestation of\nconvection, the choice of which affects our interpretations. We aim to evaluate\nthe performance of and preference for various granulation background models for\na suite of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of convection across the HR diagram,\nthereby expanding the number of simulations and coverage of parameter space for\nwhich such studies have been made. We take a statistical approach by\nconsidering the granulation in power density spectra of 3D simulations, where\nno biases or systematics of observational origin are present. To properly\ncontrast the performance of the models, we develop a Bayesian nested sampling\nframework for model inference and comparison. This framework was extended to\nreal stellar data using KIC 8006161 (Doris) and the Sun. We find that\nmulti-component models are consistently preferred over a single-component\nmodel, with each tested multi-component model demonstrating merit in specific\ncases. This occurs for simulations with no magnetic activity, thus ruling out\nstellar faculae as the sole source of the second granulation component. Like a\nprevious study, we find that a hybrid model with a single overall amplitude and\ntwo characteristic frequencies performs well for numerous simulations.\nAdditionally, a tentative third granulation component beyond the value of\n$\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$ is seen for some simulations, but its potential presence in\nobservations requires further efforts. Studying the granulation signatures in\nthese simulations paves the way to studying stars with accurate granulation\nmodels.

While current observations\nfocus on stellar accretion and inner dust emission, the fate of the\nvolatile-rich material expelled during disruption remains poorly understood. We\ninvestigate whether the hydrogen- and helium-rich gas expelled from the\ndisrupted planet's envelope and atmosphere can escape the inner system and be\ngravitationally captured by a low-mass outer planet, potentially forming a\ntransient atmosphere and producing detectable volatile contamination. We model\nthe outward diffusion of gas from a tidally stripped giant using 2D\nhydrodynamical simulations, complemented by analytical estimates of volatile\nobservability and atmospheric escape. We assess the efficiency of gas capture\nby outer planets and the survival timescales of the resulting secondary\natmospheres under high-energy stellar irradiation. Our results show that\nvolatile-rich gas can form a \"volatile-enriched planet\" (VEP). The resulting\nenvelopes can contain up to 10^-6 Earth masses -- comparable to Earth's\natmosphere -- for Earth-like planets, yielding transit depths of tens to\nhundreds of parts per million. Such signatures may persist for 1 to 100 million\nyears, depending on planetary mass, orbit, and stellar activity. This scenario\noffers a viable pathway for the formation of volatile-rich atmospheres in\nevolved low-mass planets and may help explain the properties of systems such as\nTOI-421b and WASP-107b.",

In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the\nimplications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected\ncoresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an\nextensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations\nbenchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty,\nand five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes.\nThereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between\nsample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant\nmodel robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using\nembedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk\nof inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based\non learning dynamics.

    "abstract": "(abridged) We consider a secular orbital evolution of a supermassive binary\nblack hole (SBBH) with unequal masses $M_p$ and $M_s < M_p$ in a central part\nof a non-spherical nuclear star cluster (NSC). When the mass of NSC inside the\norbit is smaller than $M_{s}$ dynamical friction becomes inefficient. The\nsubsequent orbital evolution of SBBH is largely governed by perturbing tidal\npotential of NSC arising from its non-sphericity. When the perturbing potential\nis mainly determined by quadrupole harmonics with azimuthal number $|m|=2$ the\nsecular dynamics of the SBBH does not conserve any components of the angular\nmomentum and can lead to the formation of highly eccentric orbits. Such orbits\ncan experience an efficient circularization due to emission of gravitational\nwaves (GW). In this Paper we consider this situation in some detail. We study\nanalytically and numerically the orbital evolution taking into account the\nimportant effect of Einstein apsidal precession and estimate the largest\npossible value of $e$, which can be obtained. We then estimate a possibility of\nfast orbital circularization through emission of gravitation waves on a highly\neccentric orbit, with circularization timescale of the order of the orbital\nperiod. We find that our mechanism could result in such events on a time scale\nof the order of or smaller than a few Gyr. It is stressed that for particular\nvalues of the model parameters such events may sometimes be distinguished from\nthe ones expected in more standard scenarios, since in our case the\neccentricity may remain substantial all the way down to the final merger. It is\nalso noted that our results can be applied to other astrophysical settings,\ne.g. to study the orbital evolution of a binary star or a proto planetary\nsystem inside a massive deformed gas cloud.",

Although conjectured to be\nPSPACE-complete, it remains open whether Pinwheel Scheduling is NP-hard (unless\na compact input encoding is used) or even contained in NP.\n  We introduce k-Visits, a finite version of Pinwheel Scheduling, where given n\ndeadlines, the goal is to schedule each task exactly k times. While we observe\nthat the 1-Visit problem is trivial, we prove that 2-Visits is strongly\nNP-complete through a surprising reduction from Numerical 3-Dimensional\nMatching (N3DM). As intermediate steps in the reduction, we define NP-complete\nvariants of N3DM which may be of independent interest. We further extend our\nstrong NP-hardness result to a generalization of k-Visits $k\\geq 2$ in which\nthe deadline of each task may vary throughout the schedule, as well as to a\nsimilar generalization of Pinwheel Scheduling, thus making progress towards\nsettling the complexity of Pinwheel Scheduling.\n  Additionally, we prove that 2-Visits can be solved in linear time if all\ndeadlines are distinct, rendering it one of the rare natural problems which\nexhibit the interesting dichotomy of being in P if their input is a set and\nNP-complete if the input is a multiset. We achieve this through a Turing\nreduction from 2-Visits to a variation of N3DM, which we call Position\nMatching. Based on this reduction, we also show an FPT algorithm for 2-Visits\nparameterized by a value related to how close the input deadlines are to each\nother, as well as a linear-time algorithm for instances with up to two distinct\ndeadlines.",

    "abstract": "Twelve years have passed since World IPv6 Launch Day, but what is the current\nstate of IPv6 deployment? Prior work has examined IPv6 status as a binary: can\nyou use IPv6, or not? As deployment increases we must consider a more nuanced,\nnon-binary perspective on IPv6: how much and often can a user or a service use\nIPv6? We consider this question as a client, server, and cloud provider.\nConsidering the client's perspective, we observe user traffic. We see that the\nfraction of IPv6 traffic a user sends varies greatly, both across users and\nday-by-day, with a standard deviation of over 15%. We show this variation\noccurs for two main reasons. First, IPv6 traffic is primarily human-generated,\nthus showing diurnal patterns. Second, some services are IPv6-forward and\nothers IPv6-laggards, so as users do different things their fraction of IPv6\nvaries. We look at server-side IPv6 adoption in two ways. First, we expand\nanalysis of web services to examine how many are only partially IPv6 enabled\ndue to their reliance on IPv4-only resources. Our findings reveal that only\n12.5% of top 100k websites qualify as fully IPv6-ready. Finally, we examine\ncloud support for IPv6. Although all clouds and CDNs support IPv6, we find that\ntenant deployment rates vary significantly across providers. We find that ease\nof enabling IPv6 in the cloud is correlated with tenant IPv6 adoption rates,\nand recommend best practices for cloud providers to improve IPv6 adoption. Our\nresults suggest IPv6 deployment is growing, but many services lag, presenting a\npotential for improvement.",

This state of\naffairs impedes scalability, clarity, and support for higher-level reasoning.\nMore abstract and expressive quantum programming constructs are needed.\n  To this end, we introduce a novel yet simple quantum programming language for\ngenerating unitaries from \"just a phase\"; we combine a (global) phase operation\nthat captures phase shifts with a quantum analogue of the \"if let\" construct\nthat captures subspace selection via pattern matching. This minimal language\nlifts the focus from quantum gates to eigendecomposition, conjugation, and\ncontrolled unitaries; common building blocks in quantum algorithm design.\n  We demonstrate several aspects of the expressive power of our language in\nseveral ways. Firstly, we establish that our representation is universal by\nderiving a universal quantum gate set. Secondly, we show that important quantum\nalgorithms can be expressed naturally and concisely, including Grover's search\nalgorithm, Hamiltonian simulation, Quantum Fourier Transform, Quantum Signal\nProcessing, and the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation. Furthermore, we give\nclean denotational semantics grounded in categorical quantum mechanics.\nFinally, we implement a prototype compiler that efficiently translates terms of\nour language to quantum circuits, and prove that it is sound with respect to\nthese semantics.

For each noise realization, the dynamics\npreserves Gaussianity, which allows to obtain noise-averaged\nentanglement-related quantities.

    "abstract": "We investigate quantum electrodynamics in the infrared regime (QED-IR) using\nthe adiabatic approximation and the framework of the functional Berry phase. In\nthis approach, the physical state space is exact, nonperturbatively dressed,\nand endowed with a topological structure. Electrons do not exist as bare\nparticles, but as topologically protected electron-photon clouds, defining a\nnew kind of infrared quantum. These clouds are weakly bound in energy -- with a\nbinding scale estimated at $\\Lambda_{\\text{IR}} \\sim 0.2$ eV -- and remain\nstable provided photon energies remain below this threshold. Crucially, the\ntheory becomes exactly solvable in this regime due to the quantization of the\nfunctional Berry flux, which governs the infrared dynamics of the dressed\nstates. When hard (high-energy) processes are involved, this topological\nprotection is lifted, and the theory smoothly recovers conventional\nperturbative QED. In contrast, in the deep infrared, the electromagnetic\ninteraction never fully vanishes, leading to observable effects. We argue that\nthe energy required to dissolve the infrared electron-photon cloud in QED is\napproximately 0.2 eV, well above the thermal energy of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB). However, the observed temperature anisotropies correspond to\nfluctuations near $10^{-9}$ eV, which may lie at the threshold for perturbing,\nbut not destroying, the topological structure of the dressed state. This\nsuggests that CMB deviations could reflect residual topological imprints of the\nfunctional infrared dynamics. Finally, we propose that analogous cloud-like\nstructures may manifest in other quantum systems governed by low-energy photon\ndynamics, such as atomic and molecular environments.",

    "abstract": "Many species of fish, as well as biorobotic underwater vehicles, employ body\ncaudal fin propulsion, in which a wave-like body motion culminates in\nhigh-amplitude caudal fin oscillations to generate thrust. This study uses high\nfidelity simulations of a mackerel-inspired caudal fin swimmer across a wide\nrange of Reynolds and Strouhal numbers to analyze the relationship between\nswimming kinematics and hydrodynamic forces. Central to this work is the\nderivation and use of a model for the leading edge vortex on the caudal fin.\nThis vortex dominates the thrust production from the fin and the LEV model\nforms the basis for the derivation of scaling laws grounded in flow physics.\nScaling laws are derived for thrust, power, efficiency, cost-of-transport, and\nswimming speed, and are parameterized using data from high fidelity\nsimulations. These laws are validated against published simulation and\nexperimental data, revealing several new kinematic and morphometric parameters\nthat critically influence hydrodynamic performance. The results provide a\nmechanistic framework for understanding thrust generation, optimizing swimming\nperformance, and assessing the effects of scale and morphology in aquatic\nlocomotion of both fish and biorobotic underwater vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Quasar sightline observations reveal that low-ionization-state gas corotates\nwith the galaxy disk and often at sub-centrifugal velocities, suggesting that\nthe gas is spiraling towards the galaxy disk. However, while observations\nubiquitously detect O VI absorption around low-redshift, $\\sim L^*$\nstar-forming galaxies, the relationship between O VI and the galaxy disk,\nespecially the kinematics, is not well-established. This work focuses on the O\nVI kinematics and its comparison with that of the low ions and galactic disk\nrotation. We present observations of 18 pairs of quasars and $z\\approx0.2$\nstar-forming galaxies. All quasar sightlines intersect the circumgalactic\nmedium (CGM) within 45$^\\circ$ from the galaxy major axes. We show that while\nindividual O VI velocity components do not correlate with disk rotation, the\nbulk of O VI gas in individual sightlines rarely counter-rotates. We then match\nO VI velocity components with those of low ions by minimizing the difference of\ntheir velocity centroids. The O VI velocity components with successful low-ion\nmatches are typically found at small sightline impact parameters and are more\nlikely to corotate with the disk. We suggest that the low-ion-matched O VI\nvelocity components trace the gas co-spatial with the low ions near the\nextended disk plane in the inner CGM, whereas those without low-ion matches\nrepresent the gas at large 3D radii. While the gas at large radii is\ntheoretically expected to kinematically correlate with the disk angular\nmomentum, this correlation is expected to be weaker due to the higher turbulent\nto mean rotation velocity ration at large radii, consistent with our results.",

    "abstract": "Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key\nfor AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.",

With spatial\ntranscriptomics, we can represent cellular organization, along with dynamic\ncell-cell interactions that lead to changes in cell state. Still, key\ncomputational advances are necessary to enable the data-driven learning of such\ncomplex interactive cellular dynamics.

This sample spans a wide\nrange of galaxy properties, with robust determinations of nitrogen and oxygen\nabundances via the direct-$T_{\\rm e}$ method. We explore how N/O relates to\ndensity structure, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar age,\ncompactness, and gas kinematics. In addition, we compare our results with those\nof galaxies at $z =2-10$ where N/O ratios were derived from optical or UV\nnitrogen lines, aiming to identify chemical enrichment pathways across cosmic\ntime. Our analysis shows that the N/O-O/H relation in CLASSY galaxies aligns\nwith the trends seen in local galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, and that\ngalaxies at $z = 2-6$ exhibit similar N/O values, indicating no significant\nredshift evolution in N/O. We identify a significant correlation between\nelectron density $n_{\\rm e}$([S II]) and N/O, suggesting that density structure\ncontributes to the scatter in the N/O-O/H relation. The CLASSY galaxies with\nhigh SFRs or compact star formation show elevated N/O, though no strong\ncorrelation with stellar mass is found. We also find that high-velocity\noutflows (v$_{out}$ > 350 km/s) and low mass-loading factors are linked to\nelevated N/O, indicating that feedback plays a significant role.

A detailed sensitivity analysis of drag models is performed to establish\nthe solid-fluid interaction in the slurry flow. The numerical model is\nvalidated with the experimental data from the literature and shows a fair\nagreement. The validated model is used to simulate the settling behavior of the\nslurry in the flume. The mean particle diameter of the solid particles in the\nslurry is in the range of 75-296 $\\mu$m with a median diameter of 188 $\\mu$m.\nThe effect of particle size distributions (PSDs), flume inclination, bubble\nsize and bubble volume fraction on the particle settling inside the flume is\ninvestigated in the parametric study. The analysis of our results revealed that\nthe settling of solids is significantly affected by PSDs in the open channel\nsystem. In particular, the increase in flume inclination progresses the\nsettling and dissipation of fine and coarse particles, respectively. Additional\nsimulations showed that the inception of bubbles influences the settling\nvelocity of solids, which changes the settling behavior of multisize solids\ninside the flume.

This is analogous to a known result for\ndiscrete spin networks. The derivation uses a variant of the chain-mail\nformalism, adapted to the Virasoro context. As a CFT application, we derive\nformulae for the S-transforms of the squared Virasoro crossing kernels.

    "abstract": "Wind-forced near-inertial waves (NIWs) propagate through a sea of mesoscale\neddies, which can fundamentally alter their evolution. The nature of this\nNIW--mesoscale interaction depends on how dispersive the waves are. For weakly\ndispersive waves, ray tracing suggests that the NIW frequency should be shifted\nby $\\frac{1}{2}\\zeta$, where $\\zeta$ is the mesoscale vorticity, and that the\nwaves are refracted into anticyclones. Strongly dispersive waves, in contrast,\nretain the large-scale structure of the wind forcing and exhibit a small\nnegative frequency shift. Previous in situ observational studies have indeed\nrevealed varying degrees of NIW--mesoscale interaction. Here, observations of\nNIWs from drifters are used to map the geography of NIW--mesoscale interactions\nglobally, and idealized simulations and a simple model are used to identify the\nunderlying physical processes. Almost everywhere in the ocean, with the notable\nexception of the North Pacific, the NIW frequency is strongly modulated by the\nmesoscale vorticity, with the slope of the frequency shift vs. vorticity taking\nvalues of approximately $0.4$. Concentration of NIW energy into anticyclones is\na common feature throughout the ocean. Other aspects of the observations,\nhowever, show signatures of strongly dispersive waves: a negative frequency\nshift and weaker concentration into anticyclones in regions with strong eddies\nas well as weak modulation of the NIW frequency by mesoscale eddies in the\nNorth Pacific. The signatures of both weakly and strongly dispersive NIW\nbehavior can be rationalized by the geography of the wave dispersiveness and\nthe fact that wind forcing excites multiple vertical modes with different wave\ndispersiveness. These results have implications for NIW-induced mixing in the\nupper-ocean.",

Melvin's\nelectric/magnetic universe is a static, axially symmetric solution of the\nEinstein-Maxwell equations, representing a parallel bundle of self-gravitating\nelectric/magnetic flux.

    "abstract": "Speech quality assessment (SQA) is often used to learn a mapping from a\nhigh-dimensional input space to a scalar that represents the mean opinion score\n(MOS) of the perceptual speech quality. Learning such a mapping is challenging\nfor many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent\nvariance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions\nhave been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual\nfactors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead\nto unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework\nthat pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning\non just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS\nprediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are\nthen used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity\ninformation and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean\nLibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at\ndifferent signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The encoder is later fine-tuned with\naudio samples from the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction. Experimental results\nsuggest that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly\nimproves the model performance evaluated by various metrics when compared\nagainst the same network trained from scratch without pretraining. These\nfindings suggest that incorporating perceptual factors into pretraining greatly\ncontributes to the improvement in performance for SQA.",

    "abstract": "The detection of gravitational waves (GW) by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK)\nnetwork has opened up a new era in astrophysics. The identification of the\nelectromagnetic counterparts of GW sources is crucial for multi-messenger\nastronomy, one way of which is to use galaxy catalogues to guide optical\nfollow-up observations. In this paper, we test the utility of galaxy-targeted\napproach with mass prioritised galaxy ranking for the ongoing LIGO O4 run. We\nhave used the simulated results for the expected LIGO O4 events and the NED-LVS\ngalaxy catalogue and based our study for small field of view telescopes,\nspecifically the GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). With the increase in sensitivity\nof LIGO/Virgo in the ongoing observing run O4, the expected number of total\ndetections have gone up but most of these are also now poorly localised. We\nshow that a larger volume covered in the same field-of-view (FoV) on the sky\nresults in a large increase in the total number of galaxies in each FoV. A\nsignificant top-heaviness is observed in the mass-ranked list of galaxies,\nwhich still number to a few thousand in most cases. At larger distances, such\nhigh numbers of deep follow-up observations are infeasible in most cases\nrendering galaxy catalogues useful in limited cases, but these are still useful\nat lower distances where LVK detectors are currently sensitive and where galaxy\ncompleteness is higher. We also explore the effect of mass-filling to account\nfor galaxy catalogue incompleteness at large distances. If mass-filled\nprobabilities are considered as the metric for ranking and coverage, we find\nthat the conventional 2D probability search performs better than a 3D galaxy\ncatalogue (without mass-filling) based search at distances larger than 300 Mpc\n(upto which NED-LVS is ~70% complete), and using 3D mass times probability in\neach tile performs better for nearby events.",

    "abstract": "Protoplanetary discs around Very Low Mass Stars (VLMS) show hydrocarbon-rich\nMIR spectra indicative of C/O>1 in their inner discs, in contrast to discs\naround higher-mass hosts which mostly show O-bearing species. One scenario\nproposed to elevate C/O in VLMS inner discs is the advection of O-depleted gas\nfrom the outer disc. However, if CO gas remains abundant, C/O can be at most\n~1. We test if chemical transformation of CO into other species allows this\ntransport scenario to produce C/O significantly above 1. We track the evolving\ninner disc C/H and O/H with a 1D disc evolution code. We model the transport of\nmolecules in gas and ice and add conversions of species to represent key\nreaction pathways at the midplane. We explore the role of disc mass, size,\nionization rate, and substructures. The inner disc C/O increases over time due\nto sequential delivery where O-rich species (e.g. H2O) give way to C-rich\nspecies (e.g. CH4). To reach C/O>1, separating C and O is key, hence the\nliberation of C from gaseous CO by He+ is critical. Ionization drives this\nchemistry and needs rates >~10^-17 s^-1 for VLMSs for sufficient chemical\nevolution within a disc lifetime. However, <~10^-17 s^-1 is needed to ensure\nthat C/O stays <1 for the first few Myr in T Tauri discs. While C/O is usually\nhigher for VLMS than T Tauri stars due to faster sequential delivery, C/O\nsignificantly above 1 is only produced by combining gas-phase CO destruction\nwith gas advection and radial drift. Sufficient O depletion and hydrocarbon\nproduction around VLMSs can then be achieved but may imply higher ionization\nrates than T Tauris. Observations of older discs may distinguish whether higher\nionization rates are indeed needed or faster physical evolution timescales\nalone are sufficient. CH3OH ice photodissociation at a dust trap between the\nCH3OH and CH4 snowlines may also liberate C as CH4 gas that can enrich the\ninner disc.",

Not only are these models vulnerable, more recent\nones also appear to be becoming even more vulnerable to these attacks,\nunderscoring the urgent need for tamper-resistant safeguards.

While the equilibrium phase diagram resulting from such\nintertwined orders has been extensively studied, the dynamic competition\nbetween non-equilibrium modes is a largely unexplored territory. Here, we\nintroduce a novel multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique, which enables the\nmeasurement of time-resolved tunneling (trSTM), time-resolved point-contact\n(trPC), and optical pump-probe reflectance (OPPR) on femtosecond timescales-all\nwithin a single instrument. We apply these techniques to investigate the\ncollective excitations of the unconventional charge density wave insulator\n(TaSe4)2I. Our trSTM and trPC measurements reveal charge oscillations at 0.22\nTHz, with a temperature dependence that matches the theoretically predicted\nbehavior of the long-sought massive phason gaining mass through the Higgs\nmechanism. Unexpectedly, the data also reveals a second mode at 0.11 THz\nexhibiting similar temperature and polarization dependence with comparable mode\nintensity. These features, along with the robust 1/2 frequency ratio locking\nsuggest that the 0.11 THz phason is a 'daughter mode' that arises from the\nsplitting of the 0.22 THz massive phason into two massless phasons via\nparametric amplification-analogous to the decay of a neutral pion into two\nphotons. Strikingly, comparison with OPPR data reveals that the daughter phason\ncompetes with and suppresses the amplitudon at the same frequency. Our studies\nreveal an unexplored mechanism for the generation and extinction of collective\nexcitations and pave the way for a microscopic understanding of ultrafast\nphenomena.",

    "abstract": "The nucleation of bubbles during a first-order phase transition has recently\nbeen explored using holographic duality, which can provide an important\ncomplement to standard perturbative methods. These computations typically\nrequire finding static and spatially inhomogeneous saddle points, known as\ncritical bubbles, which correspond in the gravitational dual to solutions of\nnonlinear partial differential equations. A computationally simpler alternative\nis to use the gravitational dual to derive the effective action of the boundary\ntheory in a derivative expansion, and then solve the resulting\nlower-dimensional equations of motion. Once the effective action, typically\ntruncated at two derivatives, is obtained, the holographic theory can be set\naside, and bubble solutions can be found from ordinary differential equations.\nIn this paper, we test this approach in a simple holographic setup: a probe\nscalar field in a black brane background with nonlinear multi-trace boundary\nconditions. We compute critical bubble solutions both from the effective action\nand by solving the full gravitational equations, and find good agreement\nbetween the two methods.",

Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and\nautomated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs\nare not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative\non-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on\ntwo-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal\ncar-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral\nlane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for\nhuman-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human\nfactors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a\nHCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based\non the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model\nbased on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the\nelitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and\nefficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under\ndifferent traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The\nfindings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in\nenhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging\nprocess, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption\ncompared with benchmarks.",

Using VLT/UVES\nand HST/COS quasar spectra, we analyse MgI, MgII, HI, CII, CIII, and OVI\nabsorption relative to galaxy rotation curves from Keck/LRIS and Magellan/MagE\nspectra. We find that at lower $D/R_{vir}$ ($D/R_{vir}\\leq 0.2$), over 80% of\nabsorption in all ions lies on the side of systemic velocity matching disk\nrotation, and the optical-depth-weighted median velocity ($v_{abs}$) is\nconsistent with the peak rotation speed. At higher $D/R_{vir}$ ($D/R_{vir} >\n0.2$), the kinematics diverge by ionisation state: For low ionisation gas, the\namount of co-rotating absorption remains >80%, yet $v_{abs}$ drops to 60% of\nthe galaxy rotation speed. For high ionisation gas (OVI), only 60% of the\nabsorption is consistent with co-rotation and $v_{abs}$ drops to 20% of the\nrotation speed. Furthermore, the velocity widths, corresponding to 50% of the\ntotal optical depth ($\\Delta v_{50}$) for low ionisation gas is 1.8 times\nlarger in the inner halo than at larger radii, while for CIII and OVI $\\Delta\nv_{50}$ remains unchanged with distance. These results suggest a radially\ndependent CGM kinematic structure: the inner halo hosts cool, dynamically broad\ngas tightly coupled to disk rotation, whereas beyond 0.2$R_{vir}$, particularly\ntraced by OVI and HI, the CGM shows weaker rotational alignment and lower\nvelocity dispersion. Therefore, low-ionisation gas likely traces extended\nco-rotating gas, inflows and/or recycled accretion, while high-ionisation gas\nreflects a mixture of co-rotating, lagging, discrete collisionally ionised\nstructures, indicating a kinematic stratification of the multi-phase CGM.\n[Abridged]",

Although over 30\nsuch quasars are now known at $z > 5.5$, the signal remains elusive in\npractice, owing to instrumental noise, the intrinsic weakness of the absorption\nfeatures, and the limited brightness of available background sources. Recent\nstudies have focused on the one-dimensional transmission power spectrum as a\nstatistical observable, but this approach also demands high signal-to-noise\nratios. Here, we present a systematic comparison of five inference pipelines\nfor recovering IGM parameters from mock 21-cm forest spectra at $z = 6$,\nincorporating realistic instrumental noise and telescope characteristics. We\nshow that likelihood-free inference based on machine learning substantially\noutperforms traditional Bayesian methods. In particular, our most effective\nmethod dispenses with the power spectrum entirely: we use a convolutional U-Net\nto extract a latent-space encoding of the input spectrum and perform parameter\nregression using XGBoost. This approach yields accurate constraints on the IGM\nneutral fraction and X-ray heating efficiency even with a single 50-hour uGMRT\nsightline, which is an orders-of-magnitude improvement in integration time\nrelative to existing techniques. We publicly release our code, training data,\nand models.

    "abstract": "Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations at 1.3mm\nhave recently revealed surprising complexity in the circumstellar environment\nof DFK 52, a red supergiant (RSG) located in the Stephenson 2 massive open\ncluster. We provide an initial characterisation of the star's mass-loss\nproperties by studying its circumstellar emission in continuum, $^{12}$CO,\n$^{13}$CO, and SiO rotational lines. We find that DFK 52 is surrounded by an\nextremely large outflow (up to 50,000 au in radius) that shows complex\nmorphologies in both its molecular and dust emission. The size of the\ncircumstellar medium is unprecedented, even when compared with other known\nextreme RSGs, and its lower luminosity indicates that its mass ejection\nmechanism may be unique among this population. The molecular emission can be\npartially reproduced by a two-component model consisting of a fast (27 km/s)\ndetached equatorial component with $M{\\sim}0.05$ $M_{\\odot}$ and a slow (10\nkm/s) spherical envelope with $\\dot{M}\\sim3\\times10^{-6}$ $M_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$. This suggests that DFK 52 underwent a dramatic mass-loss event\n$\\sim$4000 years ago, but has since transitioned into having a slower more\nsymmetric mass loss. We conservatively estimate a total mass of $0.1-1$\n$M_{\\odot}$ in the complex extended regions of the outflow. The uncertain\nnature of the dramatic mass loss warrants extensive follow-up of this likely\nsupernova progenitor.",

The elevated disk dispersions are in line with the\npredicted evolution based on Toomre theory and the extrapolated trends from\n$z\\sim0$-$2.5$ MS star-forming disks. The inferred dark matter (DM) mass\nfraction within the effective radius $f_{\\rm DM}(<R_{\\rm e})$ for the disk\nsystems decreases with the central baryonic mass surface density, and is\nconsistent with the trend reported by kinematic studies at $z\\lesssim3$;\nroughly half the disks have $f_{\\rm DM}(<R_{\\rm e})\\lesssim30\\%$.

However, modeling this\npopulation remains difficult due to the wide range of luminosities and black\nhole masses involved, and the high computational costs of capturing the\nhydrodynamic response of gas and evolving radiation fields on-the-fly. In this\nstudy, we present a new suite of simulations based on the IllustrisTNG galaxy\nformation framework, enhanced with on-the-fly radiative transfer, to examine\nAGN at high redshift (z > 5) in a protocluster environment extracted from the\nMillenniumTNG simulation. We focus on the co-evolution of black holes and their\nhost galaxies, as well as the radiative impact on surrounding intergalactic\ngas. The model predicts that black holes form in overdense regions and lie\nbelow the local black hole-stellar mass relation, with stellar mass assembly\npreceding significant black hole accretion. Ionizing photons are primarily\nproduced by stars, which shape the morphology of ionized regions and drive\nreionization. Given the restrictive black hole growth in the original\nIllustrisTNG model, we reduce the radiative efficiency from 0.2 to 0.1,\nresulting in higher accretion rates for massive black holes, more bursty\ngrowth, and earlier AGN-driven quenching. However, the resulting AGN remain\nsignificantly fainter than observed high-redshift quasars. As such, to\nincorporate this missing population, we introduce a quasar boosted model, in\nwhich we artificially boost the AGN luminosity.

    "abstract": "In the 1960s and 1970s a series of observations and theoretical developments\nhighlighted the presence of several anomalies which could, in principle, be\nexplained by postulating one of the following two working hypotheses: (i) the\nexistence of dark matter, or (ii) the modification of standard gravitational\ndynamics in low accelerations. In the years that followed, the dark matter\nhypothesis as an explanation for dark matter phenomenology attracted far more\nattention compared to the hypothesis of modified gravity, and the latter is\nlargely regarded today as a non-viable alternative. The present article takes\nan integrated history and philosophy of science approach in order to identify\nthe reasons why the scientific community mainly pursued the dark matter\nhypothesis in the years that followed, as opposed to modified gravity. A\nplausible answer is given in terms of three epistemic criteria for the\npursuitworthiness of a hypothesis: (a) its problem-solving potential, (b) its\ncompatibility with established theories and the feasibility of incorporation,\nand (c) its independent testability. A further comparison between the problem\nof dark matter and the problem of dark energy is also presented, explaining why\nin the latter case the situation is different, and modified gravity is still\nconsidered a viable possibility.",

First, they fail to maintain consistent background details,\nwhich limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character\nundergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing\ndetails become evident. To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist,\nwhich employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with\ndecoupled control of the foreground and background.

Our approach incorporates physical priors -- such as inertia,\ndamping, a learned potential function, and stochastic forces -- to represent\nboth autonomous and non-autonomous processes in neural systems. Crucially, the\npotential function is parameterized as a network of locally coupled\noscillators, biasing the model toward oscillatory and flow-like behaviors\nobserved in biological neural populations. Our model features a recurrent\nencoder, a one-layer Transformer decoder, and Langevin dynamics in the latent\nspace. Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on\nsynthetic neural populations generated by a Lorenz attractor, closely matching\nground-truth firing rates. On the Neural Latents Benchmark (NLB), the model\nachieves superior held-out neuron likelihoods (bits per spike) and forward\nprediction accuracy across four challenging datasets.

In this uniquely data-rich regime,\nwe take initial steps towards a more tailored IA modelling approach by building\na library of IA measurements across colour, luminosity, stellar mass, and\nredshift. We map the dependence between galaxy type -- in terms of rest-frame\ncolour, strength of the 4000 Angstrom break, and specific star formation rate\n-- and IA amplitude; the bluest galaxies have an alignment consistent with\nzero, across low ($0.05<z<0.5$) and high ($0.8<z<1.55$) redshifts. In order to\nconstruct cosmic shear samples that are minimally impacted by IA but maintain\nmaximum sample size and statistical power, we map the dependence of alignment\nwith colour purity. Red, quenched galaxies are strongly aligned and the\namplitude of the signal increases with luminosity, which is tightly correlated\nwith stellar mass in our catalogues. For DESI galaxies between $0<z<1.5$,\ntrends in luminosity and colour alone are sufficient to explain the alignments\nwe measure -- with no need for an explicit redshift dependence. In a companion\npaper (Jeffrey et al., in prep), we perform detailed modelling of the IA\nsignals with significant detections, including model comparison.

    "abstract": "Ambiguity in natural language instructions poses significant risks in\nsafety-critical human-robot interaction, particularly in domains such as\nsurgery. To address this, we propose a framework that uses Large Language\nModels (LLMs) for ambiguity detection specifically designed for collaborative\nsurgical scenarios. Our method employs an ensemble of LLM evaluators, each\nconfigured with distinct prompting techniques to identify linguistic,\ncontextual, procedural, and critical ambiguities. A chain-of-thought evaluator\nis included to systematically analyze instruction structure for potential\nissues. Individual evaluator assessments are synthesized through conformal\nprediction, which yields non-conformity scores based on comparison to a labeled\ncalibration dataset. Evaluating Llama 3.2 11B and Gemma 3 12B, we observed\nclassification accuracy exceeding 60% in differentiating ambiguous from\nunambiguous surgical instructions. Our approach improves the safety and\nreliability of human-robot collaboration in surgery by offering a mechanism to\nidentify potentially ambiguous instructions before robot action.",

The presence of a minimal\nacceleration significantly reduces the amount of dark matter required to\naccount for these curves. The model presented here is however conceptually\ndifferent from fiduciary Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). The modified\ninertia with the minimal acceleration bound closely matches with many observed\ngalaxy rotation curves and the radial acceleration relation, showing a better\nagreement than MOND in the $10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ regime.

Traditional methods and early deep learning models, such\nas convolutional neural networks (CNNs), struggle to capture long-range\ndependencies and global context essential for accurate change detection in\ncomplex scenes. While Transformer-based models mitigate these issues, their\ncomputational complexity limits their applicability in high-resolution remote\nsensing.

This\nfundamental relation holds in any metric theory of gravity, provided that\nphoton number is conserved and light propagates along null geodesics. A\ndeviation from this relation could indicate new physics beyond the standard\ncosmological model. In this work, we test the validity of the CDDR at very low\nredshifts ($z < 0.04$) by combining $d_A$ from the Megamaser Cosmology Project\nwith $d_L$ from the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa).

Assuming CDDR holds, we perform a Bayesian analysis to\nderive model-independent constraints on the calibration parameters. Using only\nBAO and SNIa data, we observe a strong degeneracy between $r_d$ and $M_b$.\nHowever, the inclusion of calibration-free Megamaser measurements breaks this\ndegeneracy, enabling independent constraints without relying on a specific\ncosmological model or distance-ladder techniques.

We applied DISTINCT to the National\nLung Screening Trial (NLST) and a companion virtual trial dataset (VLST). The\nalgorithm jointly aligned typical continuous (age, BMI) and categorical (sex,\nrace, ethnicity) variables by constructing multidimensional bins based on\ndiscretized covariates. For a given target size, DISTINCT samples individuals\nto match the joint demographic distribution of the reference population. We\nevaluated the demographic similarity between VLST and progressively larger NLST\nsubsamples using Wasserstein and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) distances to identify\nthe maximal subsample size with acceptable alignment. The algorithm identified\na maximal aligned NLST subsample of 9,974 participants, preserving demographic\nsimilarity to the VLST population. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)\nanalysis using risk scores for lung cancer detection showed that area under the\ncurve (AUC) estimates stabilized beyond 6,000 participants, confirming the\nsufficiency of aligned subsamples for virtual imaging trial evaluation.\nStratified AUC analysis revealed substantial performance variation across\ndemographic subgroups, reinforcing the importance of covariate alignment in\ncomparative studies.",

Motivated by this\nquestion, we study the associated Threshold problem: deciding whether there\nexists a correlated equilibrium whose value exceeds a given threshold. We prove\nthat this problem is PSPACE-hard for NFCE in multiplayer extensive-form games\nwith perfect recall, even for fixed thresholds. To contextualize this result,\nwe also establish the complexity of the Threshold problem for Nash equilibria\nin this setting, showing it is ER-complete. These results uncover a surprising\ncomplexity reversal: while optimal correlated equilibria are computationally\nsimpler than optimal Nash in normal-form games, the opposite holds in\nextensive-form games, where computing optimal correlated equilibria is provably\nharder. Building on this line of inquiry, we also address a related question by\n[VSF08], who introduced the notions of extensive-form correlated equilibrium\n(EFCE) and agent-form correlated equilibrium (AFCE). They asked how difficult\nthe Threshold problem is for AFCE; we answer this question by proving that it\nis NP-hard, even in two-player games without chance nodes. Complementing our\nhardness results, we establish tight complexity classifications for the\nThreshold problem across several correlated equilibrium concepts - including\nEFCE, AFCE, normal-form coarse, extensive-form coarse, and agent-form coarse\ncorrelated equilibria. For each of these solution concepts in multiplayer\nstochastic extensive-form games with perfect recall, we prove NP-completeness\nby providing matching NP upper bounds to the previously known hardness results.\nTogether, our results provide the most complete landscape to date for the\ncomplexity of optimal equilibrium computation in extensive-form games.",

    "abstract": "It has been established that a significant fraction of star formation at\nhigh-redshift occurs in clumpy galaxies. The properties of clumps and their\nformation mechanisms, however, remain highly debated. In this work we analyze a\nsample of 18 Supercompact Ultraviolet Luminous Galaxies observed with the\nOSIRIS spectrograph at the Keck Telescope, targeting their Pa-alpha emission.\nThese galaxies, although at z~0.1-0.2, share many similar properties with\nstar-forming galaxies at cosmic noon. We find a total of 84 star-forming clumps\nwith typical sizes of a few hundred parsecs. The star-forming clumps exhibit\nlow values of velocity shear (~12 km/s) and high velocity dispersion (~70\nkm/s). The dynamical masses of the clumps are typically higher than gas masses\ninferred from the measured star-formation rates of each clump. We also\nartificially redshift our data to emulate observations at z=2.2 and allow for a\ndirect comparison with other galaxies at higher redshift. Our results indicate\nthat, due to the effects of clump clustering and low-resolution observations,\nhigh-z clumps appear larger at greater cosmological distances. This underscores\nthe importance of using low-redshift observations to anchor studies at earlier\nepochs. Finally, our results support the idea of growing clump sizes in\nstar-forming galaxies as a function of redshift, although not to scales of kpc\nas found by other works without the benefits of adaptive optics or\ngravitational lensing.",

We\nderive the set of such indices. We present the left-justified generalized\nPascal triangle for $n<0$. For $k\\ge3$ and $n<0$, we show the degree of the\npolynomial does not increase monotonically with $|n|$. We derive expressions\nfor the individual polynomial coefficients (the elementary symmetric\npolynomials of the roots). We present results for the properties of the\npolynomials, for both $n>0$ and $n<0$, including factorization of the\npolynomials and properties of the roots (including bounds on the amplitudes of\nthe nonzero roots). Results are also derived for real roots. The nonzero roots\nhave a $k$-fold rotational symmetry around the origin in the complex plane. We\nemploy generating functions to derive combinatorial sums for the polynomials.\n(Separate treatments are required for $n>0$ and $n<0$.)

    "abstract": "We present a numerical study on clapping propulsion using a body consisting\nof two rigid plates hinged at one end, with a 60-degree interplate cavity. The\nclosing of the cavity generates a thrust-producing jet. Our previous\nexperimental study (Mahulkar and Arakeri, PRF, 2024) compared the flow fields\nof the clapping body in two cases: free-moving (dynamic) and\nforward-constrained (stationary). The experiments revealed significant\ndifferences in body motion and flow structures. This numerical study further\ninvestigates these differences using plate motion data from the experiments.\nOur computations show that, in dynamic cases, interplate cavity pressure is\nlower than in stationary cases. A basic unsteady Bernoulli analysis explains\nthat forward acceleration reduces interplate pressure. Furthermore, stationary\ncases exhibit distinct vortex dynamics, with starting vortex tubes forming at\nthe plate edges and reconnecting with stopping vortex tubes to form triangular\nvortex loops in the rear wake, along with two sideways-oriented ringlets. In\ndynamic cases, the starting vortex tubes slide backward and reconnect with\nbound-vorticity threads shed from the outer surface of the plates, forming\nelliptical loops that reconnect circumferentially. Referring to Sullivan et al.\n(JFM, 2008), we quantify the energy deficit in isolated axisymmetric vortex\nrings using separate simulations and propose a model for the potential energy\nin the vortex core at the formation time. Using this model, we show that the\ntotal wake energy (kinetic + potential) equals the initial slug energy for the\nvortex ring, and in clapping, it equals the work done on the fluid by the\npressure torque on the plates.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach for jointly solving the periodic Train\nTimetabling Problem (TTP), train routing, and Vehicle Circulation Problem (VCP)\nthrough a unified optimization model. While these planning stages are\ntraditionally addressed sequentially, their interdependencies often lead to\nsuboptimal vehicle usage. We propose the VCR-PESP, an integrated formulation\nthat minimizes fleet size while ensuring feasible and infrastructure-compliant\nperiodic timetables. We present the first Satisfiability Modulo Theories\n(SMT)-based method for the VCR-PESP to solve the resulting large-scale\ninstances. Unlike the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT), which requires time\ndiscretisation, SMT supports continuous time via difference constraints,\neliminating the trade-off between temporal precision and encoding size. Our\napproach avoids rounding artifacts and scales effectively, outperforming both\nSAT and Mixed Integer Program (MIP) models across non-trivial instances. Using\nreal-world data from the Swiss narrow-gauge operator RhB, we conduct extensive\nexperiments to assess the impact of time discretisation, vehicle circulation\nstrategies, route flexibility, and planning integration. We show that discrete\nmodels inflate vehicle requirements and that fully integrated solutions\nsubstantially reduce fleet needs compared to sequential approaches. Our\nframework consistently delivers high-resolution solutions with tractable\nruntimes, even in large and complex networks. By combining modeling accuracy\nwith scalable solver technology, this work establishes SMT as a powerful tool\nfor integrated railway planning. It demonstrates how relaxing discretisation\nand solving across planning layers enables more efficient and implementable\ntimetables.",

The proposed\nmodel uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization.\nUsing a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies\ndistinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through\npreliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey\ninvolving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract\nfuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world\nperceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that\nallows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative\nevaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to\ntraditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB.

    "abstract": "This study investigates how emotion-specific sentiment embedded in financial\nnews headlines interacts with firm-level Environmental, Social, and Governance\n(ESG) ratings to influence stock return behavior. Addressing key methodological\ngaps in existing literature, the analysis leverages Retrofitted Word Embeddings\nto encode discrete emotional cues tailored to ESG-relevant narratives. Unlike\nprior studies that rely on lexicon-based or transformer-based models, this\napproach explicitly incorporates domain-specific emotional semantics while\naccounting for firm-level heterogeneity and temporal sentiment fluctuations.\nUsing a dataset of 16 multinational firms and sentiment data extracted from\nSeeking Alpha headlines, the study tests three hypotheses: (1) emotion-specific\nsentiment independently predicts stock returns; (2) the moderating effect of\nsentiment varies across ESG dimensions; and (3) positive (negative) sentiment\namplifies (dampens) ESG performance effects. The analysis implements a dual\nsentiment aggregation strategy and introduces a triple-significance filtering\ncriterion to identify robust interactions. Results support Hypotheses 1 and 2,\nwith emotions such as anticipation and trust showing consistent associations\nwith return variation across firms and ESG categories. However, findings for\nHypothesis 3 are mixed: while some sentiment-ESG combinations align with\ntheoretical expectations, many contradictory interactions exhibit stronger\neffects. In this study, retrofitted embeddings outperform the NRC Emotion\nLexicon in explaining stock return variation within ESG-sentiment interaction\nmodels, underscoring the value of emotional nuance in ESG-finance modeling.\nThese results underscore the importance of emotion-sensitive sentiment modeling\nin understanding investor behavior and ESG-related stock price movements.",

We propose a framework, inspired\nby open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three \"dogmas.\" We\nrevisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning. We\nthen address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,\nusing analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.\nmulti-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration\nin RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence\nof a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the\nevolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it\ngestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from\norigins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication\noffer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained\nreinforcement learning in biological systems.",

This enhanced capability not\nonly further reduces out-of-the-fridge data transmission but also adapts more\neffectively to clustered errors observed under a variety of noise models.\nSpecifically, under data-qubit-only errors and uniformly random noise,\nClique_L2 achieves up to 8.95x decoding bandwidth reduction over the original\nClique (or Clique_L1) decoder, especially beneficial at higher code distances.\nWhen clustered errors and longer error chains are more likely to occur,\nClique_L2 achieves up to 18.3x decoding bandwidth reduction over Clique_L1,\nachieving substantial benefits across a wide range of physical qubit error\nrates.",

Results show that 3C-FBI achieves state-of-the-art\naccuracy (Jaccard index 0.896) while maintaining real-time performance (40.3\nfps), significantly outperforming classical methods like RCD (6.8 fps) on a\nstandard CPU (i7-10875H). It maintains near-perfect accuracy (Jaccard almost\n1.0) at high resolutions (480x480) and reliable performance (Jaccard higher\nthan 0.95) down to 160x160 with up to 20% outliers.\n  In extensive synthetic testing, 3C-FBI achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.989\nacross contamination levels, comparable to modern methods like Qi et al.

IoT devices typically collect data\nfrom various sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and energy meters. Much of\nthis data is temporal in nature. Traditionally, data from IoT devices is\ncentralized for analysis, but this approach introduces delays and increased\ncommunication costs. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective\nalternative, allowing for model training across distributed devices without the\nneed to centralize data. In many applications, such as smart home energy and\nenvironmental monitoring, the data collected by IoT devices across different\nlocations can exhibit significant variation in trends and seasonal patterns.\nAccurately forecasting such non-stationary, non-linear time-series data is\ncrucial for applications like energy consumption estimation and weather\nforecasting. However, these data variations can severely impact prediction\naccuracy. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) Investigating how\nnon-linear, non-stationary time-series data distributions, like generalized\nextreme value (gen-extreme) and log norm distributions, affect FL performance.\n(2) Analyzing how different detrending techniques for non-linear time-series\ndata influence the forecasting model's performance in a FL setup. We generated\nseveral synthetic time-series datasets using non-linear data distributions and\ntrained an LSTM-based forecasting model using both centralized and FL\napproaches. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of detrending on real-world\ndatasets with non-linear time-series data distributions. Our experimental\nresults show that: (1) FL performs worse than centralized approaches when\ndealing with non-linear data distributions. (2) The use of appropriate\ndetrending techniques improves FL performance, reducing loss across different\ndata distributions.",

The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high\nfrequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing\ncollision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in\nmulti-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal\ntrajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their\nassigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation\nfrom (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables\nthe framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an\ninstantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast\nstate-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack\n(Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and\nversatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous\nand partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick\nreplanning.

    "abstract": "We study when a Riemann difference of order $ n $ possesses the\nMarcinkiewicz-Zygmund (MZ) property: that is, whether the conditions $ f(h) =\no(h^{n-1}) $ and $ Df(h) = o(h^n) $ imply $ f(h) = o(h^n) $. This implication\nis known to hold for some classical examples with geometric nodes, such as $\n\\{0, 1, q, \\dots, q^{n-1}\\} $ and $ \\{1, q, \\dots, q^n\\} $, leading to a\nconjecture that these are the only such Riemann differences with the MZ\nproperty. However, this conjecture was disproved by the third-order example\nwith nodes $ \\{-1, 0, 1, 2\\} $, and we provide further counterexamples and a\ngeneral classification here.\n  We establish a complete analytic criterion for the MZ property by developing\na recurrence framework: we analyze when a function $ R(h) $ satisfying $ D(h) =\nR(qh) - A R(h) $, together with $ D(h) = o(h^n) $ and $ R(h) = o(h^{n-1}) $,\nforces $ R(h) = o(h^n) $. We prove that this holds if and only if $ A $ lies\noutside a critical modulus annulus determined by $ q $ and $ n $, covering both\n$ |q| > 1 $ and $ |q| < 1 $ cases.

However, using\nredshifts as distance proxies introduces distortions in the 3D galaxy\ndistribution. If uncorrected, these distortions lead to systematic errors in\nLSS analyses and cosmological parameter estimation. We present a new method\nthat combines linear theory (LT) and a neural network (NN) to mitigate redshift\nspace distortions (RSDs). The hybrid LT+NN approach is trained and validated on\ndark matter halo fields from z = 1 snapshots of the Quijote N-body simulations.\nLT corrects large-scale distortions in the linear regime, while the NN learns\nquasi-linear and small-scale features. The LT correction is applied first, then\nthe NN is trained on the resulting fields to improve accuracy across scales.\nThe method uses a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and yields significant\nperformance gains: approximately 50% improvement over LT alone and 12% over NN\nalone. The reconstructed fields from the LT+NN method show stronger\ncorrelations with the true real-space fields than either LT or NN separately.\nThe hybrid method also improves clustering statistics such as halo-halo and\nhalo-void correlations, with benefits extending to BAO scales. Compared to\nNN-only, it provides better suppression of spurious anisotropies on large and\nquasi-linear scales, as measured by the quadrupole moments of correlation\nfunctions. This work shows that combining a physically motivated dynamical\nmodel with a machine learning algorithm leverages the strengths of both\napproaches. The LT+NN method achieves high accuracy with modest training data\nand computational cost, making it a promising tool for future applications to\nmore realistic galaxy surveys.",

Using Von Neumann entropy as our\nmeasure, we derive precise mathematical relationships for maximum entanglement\nin graph states as a function of qubit number.

While some\nartificial intelligence models have been developed, they often operate as black\nboxes, lacking the interpretability needed for clinical trust. Moreover, these\nmodels typically evaluate nodes in isolation, overlooking the patient-level\ncontext. To address these limitations, we introduce LRMR, an LLM-Driven\nRelational Multi-node Ranking framework. This approach reframes the diagnostic\ntask from a direct classification problem into a structured reasoning and\nranking process. The LRMR framework operates in two stages. First, a multimodal\nlarge language model (LLM) analyzes a composite montage image of all LNs from a\npatient, generating a structured report that details ten distinct radiological\nfeatures. Second, a text-based LLM performs pairwise comparisons of these\nreports between different patients, establishing a relative risk ranking based\non the severity and number of adverse features. We evaluated our method on a\nretrospective cohort of 117 rectal cancer patients. LRMR achieved an area under\nthe curve (AUC) of 0.7917 and an F1-score of 0.7200, outperforming a range of\ndeep learning baselines, including ResNet50 (AUC 0.7708). Ablation studies\nconfirmed the value of our two main contributions: removing the relational\nranking stage or the structured prompting stage led to a significant\nperformance drop, with AUCs falling to 0.6875 and 0.6458, respectively. Our\nwork demonstrates that decoupling visual perception from cognitive reasoning\nthrough a two-stage LLM framework offers a powerful, interpretable, and\neffective new paradigm for assessing lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer.",

However, its reliance on equilibrium quantities excludes analysis of\nnonequilibrium dynamics at early times. Most works have thus focused on\nobtaining rates and transition time and path distributions in equilibrium.\nInstead, here we consider early-time nonequilibrium dynamics in a model system\nof a particle with overdamped dynamics hopping over the barrier in a\ndouble-well potential, using the Smoluchowski equation (SE) and stochastic path\nintegral (SPI) mapping of the Langevin equation. We identify several key\ntimescales relevant to nonequilibrium dynamics and quantify them using the SE\nand SPI approaches. The shortest timescale corresponds to equilibration in a\nwell at time $t \\ll \\tau_{\\rm B}$, where $\\tau_{\\rm B}$ is the Brownian\ndiffusion time. The second important timescale is when an inflexion point\nappears in the effective potential constructed from the density at $t\n\\lessapprox \\tau_{\\rm B}$. Shortly after, the existence of a second potential\nwell can be inferred from sufficient sampling of the dynamics. Interestingly,\nthis timescale decreases with increasing barrier height. We find significant\ndeviations from the equilibrium limit unless $t \\gg \\tau_{\\rm B}$. We further\ncalculate \\red{the} density current at the barrier for bistable and asymmetric\npotentials and find that it crosses over to that from equilibrium rate theory\nat a time that does not appear to depend on the barrier height.

    "abstract": "The partially dissipative systems that characterize many physical phenomena\nwere first pointed out by Godunov (1961), then investigated by Friedrichs-Lax\n(1971) who introduced the convex entropy, and later by Shizuta-Kawashima\n(1984,1985) who initiated a simple sufficient criterion ensuring the global\nexistence of smooth solutions and their large-time asymptotics. There has been\nremarkable progress in the past several decades, through various different\nattempts. However, the decay character theory for partially dissipative\nhyperbolic systems remains largely open, as the Fourier transform of Green's\nfunction is generally not explicit in multi-dimensions. In this paper, we\npropose a general $L^p$ energy method and provide the positive answer to the\nunsolved question left in [5]. Under the convex entropy and Shizuta-Kawashima\nconditions, we pinpoint the critical regularity for the global solutions to the\npartially dissipative systems in the hybrid Besov spaces with different\nexponents on conservative and dissipative components in low and high\nfrequencies, from the viewpoint of spectral analysis and the $L^1$ time\nintegrability of Lipschitz bound. Furthermore, a new effective quantity\n$\\Psi(t,x)$ capturing the interaction of conservative and dissipative\ncomponents is introduced, which enables us to establish the sharp\ncharacterization of large-time asymptotic behavior. Finally, we also show that,\nwith faster orders of convergence, the conservative and dissipative components\nof solutions can be asymptotically approximated by new profiles generated from\nparabolic systems subjected to $\\Psi_0$ (the initial effective quantity), in\nthe spirit of Chapman-Enskog expansion.",

Alternatively, some algorithms also exist for the reconfiguration of\nindependent sets in the token sliding paradigm for graph classes with bounded\ndegree or large girth.\n  We show that DSR-TS is W[2]-hard when parameterized $k$, the pathwidth of the\ninstance, and the iteration of the reconfiguration sequence (a recently\nintroduced parameter).

The CFD models\nwere validated against field data collected from a coal slurry pipeline of 128\n$km$ in length, 0.575~$m$ in diameter, achieving an average error of less than\n15\\% for outlet solid concentration over time.

The obtained outcomes indicate that higher water velocity is\npreferred and an increase in water velocity from $1.88~m/s$ to $5.88~m/s$\nreduces the water consumption by $28\\%$. Large bubbles may hinder the flushing\nprocess and increase the water consumption by $23\\%$.

Moreover, the detected variability requires very\nstrong particle confinement in both the acceleration and emitter, which sets a\nlower limit on their magnetic fields that is barely consistent with the\nsynchrotron cooling constraint from acceleration. Synchrotron losses may be\nhigher in the emitter if it is separated from the accelerator, but this\nrequires a very hard particle injection spectrum. An accelerator based on an\nultrarelativistic outflow can alleviate these requirements.

    "abstract": "Activation functions are critical to the performance of deep neural networks,\nparticularly in domains such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS),\nwhere nonlinearity, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and signal variability\nposes significant challenges to model accuracy. However, the impact of\nactivation functions on deep learning (DL) performance in the fNIRS domain\nremains underexplored and lacks systematic investigation in the current\nliterature. This study evaluates a range of conventional and field-specific\nactivation functions for fNIRS classification tasks using multiple deep\nlearning architectures, including the domain-specific fNIRSNet, AbsoluteNet,\nMDNN, and shallowConvNet (as the baseline), all tested on a single dataset\nrecorded during an auditory task. To ensure fair a comparison, all networks\nwere trained and tested using standardized preprocessing and consistent\ntraining parameters. The results show that symmetrical activation functions\nsuch as Tanh and the Absolute value function Abs(x) can outperform commonly\nused functions like the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), depending on the\narchitecture. Additionally, a focused analysis of the role of symmetry was\nconducted using a Modified Absolute Function (MAF), with results further\nsupporting the effectiveness of symmetrical activation functions on performance\ngains. These findings underscore the importance of selecting proper activation\nfunctions that align with the signal characteristics of fNIRS data.",

This problem is exacerbated by the trend towards bigger\nmodels trained on large amounts of data to solve more general tasks, such as\nthe recently introduced task-aware unified source separation (TUSS) model.\nTUSS, which aims to solve audio source separation tasks using a single,\nconditional model, is built upon TF-Locoformer, a TF dual-path model combining\nconvolution and attention layers. The task definition comes in the form of a\nsequence of prompts that specify the number and type of sources to be\nextracted.

The\nstarting point is the least square fit of a set of experimental values of\nelastic differential cross sections, varying the relevant optical potential\nparameters. This is done using standard $\\chi^2$ minimization codes, that\nprovide the covariance matrix of the parameters. A maximum likelihood\nexploration of the $\\chi^2$ surface in parameter space allows to determine the\ncovariance matrix of the parameters associated to a contour of a given $\\chi^2$\nvalue.

    "abstract": "Solving chance-constrained optimal control problems for systems subject to\nnon-stationary uncertainties is a significant challenge.Conventional robust\nmodel predictive control (MPC) often yields excessive conservatism by relying\non static worst-case assumptions, while standard stochastic MPC methods\nstruggle when underlying uncertainty distributions are unknown a priori.This\narticle presents a Risk-Aware Adaptive Robust MPC (RAAR-MPC) framework,a\nhierarchical architecture that systematically orchestrates a novel synthesis of\nproactive, learning-based risk assessment and reactive risk regulation. The\nframework employs a medium-frequency risk assessment engine, which leverages\nGaussian process regression and active learning, to construct a tight,\ndata-driven characterization of the prediction error set from operational\ndata.Concurrently, a low-timescale outer loop implements a self-correcting\nupdate law for an adaptive safety margin to precisely regulate the empirical\nrisk and compensate for unmodeled dynamics.This dual-timescale adaptation\nenables the system to rigorously satisfy chance constraints with a user-defined\nprobability, while minimizing the conservatism inherent in traditional\napproaches.We formally establish that the interplay between these adaptive\ncomponents guarantees recursive feasibility and ensures the closed-loop system\nsatisfies the chance constraints up to a user-defined risk level with high\nprobability.Numerical experiments on a benchmark DC-DC converter under\nnon-stationary parametric uncertainties demonstrate that our framework\nprecisely achieves the target risk level, resulting in a significantly lower\naverage cost compared to state-of-the-art robust and stochastic MPC strategies.",

Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary\nmatrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable\nexploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using\nentanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define\nunconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per\nqubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and\nevaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified\n64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently\noutperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing\nconfigurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical\nmodel (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring,\nnearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the\nclassical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered\nup to ~20% higher accuracy.

Successful autoencoders train to\nbuild a model that captures the features of data in a dimensionally reduced\nform (the latent representation) that can then be used to recreate the original\ninput. One application is the reconstruction of incomplete or noisy data. Here\na baseline, lightweight convolutional autoencoder is used to examine the\nutility for planetary image reconstruction or inpainting in situations where\nthere is destructive random noise (i.e., either luminance noise with zero\nreturned data in some image pixels, or color noise with random additive levels\nacross pixel channels).

In contrast, neural network models suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting: a significant degradation in performance on previously learned\ntasks when acquiring new information. The Complementary Learning Systems (CLS)\ntheory offers an explanation for this human ability, proposing that the brain\nhas distinct systems for pattern separation (encoding distinct memories) and\npattern completion (retrieving complete memories from partial cues). To capture\nthese complementary functions, we leverage the representational generalization\ncapabilities of variational autoencoders (VAEs) and the robust memory storage\nproperties of Modern Hopfield networks (MHNs), combining them into a neurally\nplausible continual learning model. We evaluate this model on the Split-MNIST\ntask, a popular continual learning benchmark, and achieve close to\nstate-of-the-art accuracy (~90%), substantially reducing forgetting.\nRepresentational analyses empirically confirm the functional dissociation: the\nVAE underwrites pattern completion, while the MHN drives pattern separation. By\ncapturing pattern separation and completion in scalable architectures, our work\nprovides a functional template for modeling memory consolidation,\ngeneralization, and continual learning in both biological and artificial\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, bound states in the continuum (BICs) have attracted\nextensive attentions in the sensing field due to their theoretically ultra-high\nresonance quality factors (Q-factors). Among them, Friedrich-Wintgen (F-W)\nBICs, which arise from the interference between different coupled modes, are\nparticularly promising for acoustic sensing applications owing to the easy\nrealization. Most existing F-W BICs are realized in open systems through the\ninterference between waveguides and resonant cavities. However, with increasing\ndemands for higher resolution and sensitivity in modern chemical and biological\nsensing, the practically measured Q-factors of conventional open-system F-W\nBICs often fall short of expectations.In this work, we introduce F-P resonance\nvia acoustic-solid coupling to explore the formation mechanism and realization\nmethod of high-Q F-W BICs in quasi-closed systems, and further investigate\ntheir application in gas sensing. A coupled resonator model combining elastic\nand acoustic waves in a quasi-closed cavity is first established. Coupled mode\ntheory is employed to calculate the eigenmodes of both localized and radiative\nmodes. Based on this, the Hamiltonian matrix of the coupled system is\nconstructed, from which the acoustic transmission spectrum is derived. The\nresults show that the Q-factor of the F-W BIC induced by acoustic-solid\ncoupling is significantly higher than that of open systems, which is further\nvalidated by experiments.Based on this, a gas concentration sensing technique\nbased on acoustic-solid coupled F-W BIC behavior is developed. A sensing device\nis fabricated accordingly, and gas concentration measurements are carried out.\nExperimental results demonstrate a pronounced response to gases with different\nconcentrations, confirming the feasibility and reliability of this novel gas\nsensing approach.",

Specifically,\nutilizing sparse/incomplete measured data, a time-dependent optimization\nproblem is formulated for determining the expansion coefficients of an\nassociated low-dimensional representation of the stochastic wind field.\nCompared to an alternative, standard, compressive sampling treatment of the\nproblem, the developed methodology exhibits the following advantages. First,\nthe Bayesian formulation enables also the quantification of the uncertainty in\nthe estimates. Second, the requirement in standard CS-based applications for an\na priori selection of the expansion basis is circumvented. Instead, this is\ndone herein in an adaptive manner based on the acquired data. Overall, the\nmethodology exhibits enhanced extrapolation accuracy, even in cases of\nhigh-dimensional data of arbitrary form, and of relatively large extrapolation\ndistances. Thus, it can be used, potentially, in a wide range of wind\nengineering applications where various constraints dictate the use of a limited\nnumber of sensors. The efficacy of the methodology is demonstrated by\nconsidering two case studies. The first relates to the extrapolation of\nsimulated wind velocity records consistent with a prescribed joint\nwavenumber-frequency power spectral density in a three-dimensional domain (2D\nand time).

Quasar catalogues from narrow-band photometric data are used in a\nvariety of applications, including targeting for spectroscopic follow-up,\nmeasurements of supermassive black hole masses, or Baryon Acoustic\nOscillations. Here, we present the final quasar catalogue, including redshift\nestimates, from the miniJPAS Data Release constructed using several flavours of\nmachine-learning algorithms. Methods. In this work, we use a machine learning\nalgorithm to classify quasars, optimally combining the output of 8 individual\nalgorithms. We assess the relative importance of the different classifiers. We\ninclude results from 3 different redshift estimators to also provide improved\nphotometric redshifts. We compare our final catalogue against both simulated\ndata and real spectroscopic data. Our main comparison metric is the $f_1$\nscore, which balances the catalogue purity and completeness. Results. We\nevaluate the performance of the combined algorithm using synthetic data. In\nthis scenario, the combined algorithm outperforms the rest of the codes,\nreaching $f_1=0.88$ and $f_1=0.79$ for high- and low-z quasars (with $z\\geq2.1$\nand $z<2.1$, respectively) down to magnitude $r=23.5$. We further evaluate its\nperformance against real spectroscopic data, finding different performances. We\nconclude that our simulated data is not realistic enough and that a new version\nof the mocks would improve the performance. Our redshift estimates on mocks\nsuggest a typical uncertainty of $\\sigma_{\\rm NMAD} =0.11$, which, according to\nour results with real data, could be significantly smaller (as low as\n$\\sigma_{\\rm NMAD}=0.02$). We note that the data sample is still not large\nenough for a full statistical consideration.",

    "abstract": "Tidal deformability measures how NS can comfortably deform as a response to\nan applied tidal field. We use updated constraints on the mass, radius, and\ntidal deformability of neutron star (NS) objects and pulsars to examine nuclear\nequations of state (EOS) based on realistic finite-range M3Y nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction, which have been successfully used to describe low- and high-dense\nnuclear matter (NM). We then employ these EOSs to examine the impact of tidal\ndeformability and compactness of NSs on their structure. We found that the EOSs\nfrom CDM3Y-230 to CDM3Y-330 characterized with the saturation incompressibility\n${K}_{0}=230-330$ MeV together yield more limited ranges of tidal deformability\nand radius for NS objects than their experimentally inferred ranges. For light\nNS ($M<\\text{M}_{\\odot}$), both ${k}_{2}$ and $\\mathcal{C}$ decreases upon\ndecreasing the NS mass, which enhances its tidal deformability. The stiffness\nof the NS core matter has shown a minor effect on the tidal deformability of\nsuch NS ($M<\\text{M}_{\\odot}$). An opposite behavior is obtained as an increase\nin the tidal Love number but a decrease in the more effective compactness of NS\n($M>\\text{M}_{\\odot}$), upon increasing (decreasing) the stiffness of the\nemployed EOS (its mass). This appears as enhanced tidal deformability indicated\nat a larger radius for NS of stiffer NM and for the lighter NS above\n$\\text{M}_{\\odot}$. Unified description of some correlations between tidal\ndeformability, tidal Love number, and NS compactness is provided independent of\nthe details of the considered EOS.",

In this work, we study the interplay of collider, direct and\nindirect detection constraints on an extension of the dark Abelian Higgs model\nthat includes a Dirac fermionic DM candidate, $\\chi$. We take into account in a\nconsistent fashion the dilution of the indirect and direct detection signals\nwhen the relic abundance of $\\chi$ is smaller than the total observed DM\ndensity (assuming that it is a subdominant component in those cases). As a\nconsequence, we show that indirect detection constraints cannot probe regions\nwith large kinetic mixing, and direct detection experiments provide the leading\nconstraints in most of the parameter space. Collider searches for the\n(invisibly decaying) vector mediator provide complementary bounds in areas with\nlarge kinetic mixing. We find that the only way to avoid both indirect and\ndirect detection limits is in narrow windows of parameter space close to\n$m_\\chi\\lesssim m_{Z_D}/2$, when $\\chi$ is produced resonantly in the early\nuniverse, and it can constitute all of the DM. For this to happen, a small dark\nsector coupling is required: $\\alpha_D~\\lesssim10^{-3}$ for DM masses below $6$\nGeV, or $\\alpha_D~\\lesssim10^{-5}$ for DM masses larger than $10$ GeV.

Traditional methods approximate Nash equilibria (NE) using either\nregret-based methods (time-average convergence) or contraction-map-based\nmethods (last-iterate convergence). We propose a new method based on\nHamiltonian dynamics in physics and prove that it can characterize the set of\nNE in a finite (linear) number of iterations of alternating gradient descent in\nthe unbounded setting, modulo degeneracy, a first in online optimization.\nUnlike standard methods for computing NE, our proposed approach can be\nparallelized and works with arbitrary learning rates, both firsts in\nalgorithmic game theory.

Despite the valuable insights it can offer, extracting\nmeaningful information from unstructured data is more complex compared to\nstructured data. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has gained popularity for\nautomating repetitive tasks, improving efficiency, and reducing errors.\nHowever, RPA is traditionally reliant on structured data, limiting its\napplication to processes involving unstructured documents. This study addresses\nthis limitation by developing the UNstructured Document REtrieval SyStem\n(UNDRESS), a system that uses fuzzy regular expressions, techniques for natural\nlanguage processing, and large language models to enable RPA platforms to\neffectively retrieve information from unstructured documents. The research\ninvolved the design and development of a prototype system, and its subsequent\nevaluation based on text extraction and information retrieval performance.

Results show that system costs rise nonlinearly with\nthe geographic extent of these events: a single worst-case regional disruption\nincreases costs by 9%, but broader disruptions across multiple regions lead to\nmuch sharper increases, up to 51%. As Dunkelflaute conditions extend across\nmost of Europe, additional cost impacts level off, with a maximum increase of\n71%.

While popular methods like integer programming yield logistics\nplans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, they are slow and assume\nan idealized mathematical model of the environment that does not account for\nuncertainty. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can handle\nuncertainty and promise to accelerate replanning while lowering the barrier to\nentry by translating free-form utterances into executable plans, yet they\nremain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety\nand cost. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility\nof natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation.\nIt converts user requests into structured planning specifications, quantifies\nits own uncertainty at the field and token level, and invokes an interactive\nclarification loop whenever confidence falls below an adaptive threshold.

The aim of this paper is to analyse the carbon abundance\ndetermination for the large empirical X-shooter Spectral Library (XSL),\ncommonly used as a benchmark for the development of stellar population models.\nThe analysis was performed over strong molecular CH bands in the G-band region.\nWe used the GAUGUIN automated spectrum synthesis code, and adopted two\ndifferent grids of reference synthetic spectra separately, each with the same\n[C/Fe] abundance coverage. We carried out a detailed comparison between both\ngrids to evaluate the accuracy and the model dependence of the measured [C/Fe]\nabundances. We obtained a large and precise unbiased [C/Fe] abundance catalogue\nfrom both theoretical grids, well distributed in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR)\ndiagram and with no trend with the stellar parameters. We also measured\ncompatible values from each independent CH band, with a high-quality [C/Fe]\nabundance estimate for both dwarfs and giants indistinctly. We observed a\ndispersed flat trend around [C/Fe] = 0.0 dex all along the metallicity regime,\nin agreement with some literature studies. However, we reported variations up\nto 0.8 dex in the [C/Fe] composition of the star depending on the adopted grid.\nWe did not find such differences in the $\\alpha$-element measurements. This\nbehaviour implies a strong model dependence in the [C/Fe] abundance estimate.\nPotential sources of error could be associated with the use of spectral\nsynthesis methods to derive stellar carbon abundances in the CH4300A band.\nIntrinsic small differences in the synthetic models over this crowded and\nblended region may induce a large disparity in the precise abundance estimate\nfor any stellar type, leading to inaccurate carbon measurements without being\nnoticed",

This approach allows for improved temporal resolution compared\nto conventional nanosecond diagnostics, enabling measurements of\n$\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ as small as 50 ps, the corresponding $N_H$ reaching down\nto $10^{14} cm^{-3}$. Atomic densities are calibrated by performing identical\nps--TALIF measurements in krypton gas contained in a custom-built low-pressure\ncuvette. Physical mechanisms that may be involved in the TALIF scheme such as\nphotoionisation and/or stimulated emission are also assessed, ensuring reliable\nstudies. The determined $\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ and $N_H$ increase with the\nhelium flow rate ($Q_{He}$) in the range $Q_{He}=0.3-1$ slm. Both quantities\nare maximized near the exit nozzle of the $\\mu$APPJ, obtaining values below 400\nps and $6x10^{14} cm^{-3}$, respectively. As the axial distance increases,\n$\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ declines with a rate of $\\approx$65 ps/mm for $Q_{He}=1$\nslm which is about 3 times smaller than for $Q_{He}=0.3$ slm. These findings\nreveal a strong correlation between the experimentally-measured\n$\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ and the local air entrainment into the jet as indicated\nby their comparison with calculated effective lifetimes based on published\nquenching rates. Furthermore, operating the $\\mu$APPJ in the burst mode allows\nfor the estimation of the residence time ($t_{res}$) of ground state H--atoms\nin the helium gas channel, which is larger for $Q_{He}=0.3$ slm ($t_{res}\n\\approx 1.2 ms$) compared to $Q_{He}=1$ slm ($t_{res} \\approx 0.5 ms$). H-atoms\nconsumption in the gas channel can be affected by diffusion and mechanisms\ninvolving neutral ground-state and metastable species among others.\nFurthermore, based on an error propagation analysis, density uncertainty as\nhigh as 64% (depending on the operating condition) is revealed. This mainly\noriginates in the ratio of the two-photon absorption cross sections of Kr and H\natoms ( $\\sigma^{(2)}Kr$ / $\\sigma^{(2)}H$) which has not yet been measured in\nthe picosecond regime.

Among these, CuInS$_{2}$ QDs have gained significant\nattention owing to their remarkable broadband emission, making them highly\ndesirable for various optoelectronic applications requiring efficient\nluminescent nanomaterials. However, maximizing radiative recombination in\nCuInS$_{2}$ QDs often necessitates minimizing intragap trap states. A common\napproach involves the introduction of Zn during the synthesis, which typically\npromotes the formation of a ZnS shell that passivates the QD surface.\n  Despite its importance, the characterization and quantification of Zn\nincorporation using conventional techniques, such as optical spectroscopy or\nelectron microscopy, remains challenging. In this study, we utilized X-ray\nabsorption spectroscopy (XAS), in both X-ray absorption near-edge structure\n(XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectral ranges,\nto investigate Zn incorporation into CuInS$_{2}$ QDs with element-specific\nprecision. This approach allowed us to detect the formation of a ZnS surface\nshell and to resolve the spatial distribution of Zn atoms within the QD\nlattice, distinguishing between Zn as a substituent, or as an interstitial\ndefect.\n  Additionally, we explored the optical and dynamical properties of CuInS$_{2}$\nQDs using time-resolved optical spectroscopies, particularly in the presence of\nelectron and hole acceptors.

This lack of omni datasets and lightweight,\ncapable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video\nunderstanding.

The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs\nprobing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we\npropose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from\nGemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine\ntuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach\nenables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive\nperformance.

Demand-driven\nnavigation (DDN) enables robots to identify and locate objects based on\nimplicit human intent, even when object locations are unknown. However,\ntraditional data-driven DDN methods rely on pre-collected data for model\ntraining and decision-making, limiting their generalization capability in\nunseen scenarios. In this paper, we propose CogDDN, a VLM-based framework that\nemulates the human cognitive and learning mechanisms by integrating fast and\nslow thinking systems and selectively identifying key objects essential to\nfulfilling user demands. CogDDN identifies appropriate target objects by\nsemantically aligning detected objects with the given instructions.\nFurthermore, it incorporates a dual-process decision-making module, comprising\na Heuristic Process for rapid, efficient decisions and an Analytic Process that\nanalyzes past errors, accumulates them in a knowledge base, and continuously\nimproves performance. Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning strengthens the\ndecision-making process. Extensive closed-loop evaluations on the AI2Thor\nsimulator with the ProcThor dataset show that CogDDN outperforms single-view\ncamera-only methods by 15\\%, demonstrating significant improvements in\nnavigation accuracy and adaptability.

However,\nexisting MVS methods often struggle with challenging regions, such as\ntextureless regions and reflective surfaces, where feature matching fails. In\ncontrast, monocular depth estimation inherently does not require feature\nmatching, allowing it to achieve robust relative depth estimation in these\nregions. To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature\nand depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular\nfoundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of\nthe reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention\nmechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding. Then, the\nmonocular depth of the reference view is aligned to dynamically update the\ndepth candidates for edge regions during the sampling procedure. Finally, a\nrelative consistency loss is further designed based on the monocular depth to\nsupervise the depth prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nMonoMVSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU and\nTanks-and-Temples datasets, ranking first on the Tanks-and-Temples Intermediate\nand Advanced benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Progress in high-energy physics has been closely tied to the development of\nhighperformance electromagnetic calorimeters. Recent experiments have\ndemonstrated the possibility to significantly accelerate the development of\nelectromagnetic showers inside scintillating crystals typically used in\nhomogeneous calorimeters based on scintillating crystals when the incident beam\nis aligned with a crystallographic axis to within a few mrad. In particular, a\nreduction of the radiation length has been measured when ultrarelativistic\nelectron and photon beams were incident on a high-Z scintillator crystal along\none of its main axes. Here, we propose the possibility to exploit this physical\neffect for the design of a new type of compact e.m. calorimeter, based on\noriented ultrafast lead tungstate (PWO-UF) crystals, with a significant\nreduction in the depth needed to contain electromagnetic showers produced by\nhigh-energy particles with respect to the state-of-the-art. We report results\nfrom tests of the crystallographic quality of PWO-UF samples via\nhigh-resolution X-ray diffraction and photoelastic analysis. We then describe a\nproof-of-concept calorimeter geometry defined with a Geant4 model including the\nshower development in oriented crystals. Finally, we discuss the experimental\ntechniques needed for the realization of a matrix of scintillator crystals\noriented along a specific crystallographic direction. Since the angular\nacceptance for e.m. shower acceleration depends little on the particle energy,\nwhile the decrease of the shower length remains pronounced at very high energy,\nan oriented crystal calorimeter will open the way for applications at the\nmaximum energies achievable in current and future experiments. Such\napplications span from forward calorimeters, to compact beam dumps for the\nsearch for light dark matter, to source-pointing space-borne {\\gamma}-ray\ntelescopes.",

However, current\nsystolic-array-based accelerators face significant challenges when executing\nFlashAttention. Systolic arrays achieve high utilization primarily for\nconsecutive and large matrix multiplications, whereas FlashAttention requires\nfrequent interleaving of matrix multiplications and softmax operations.\n  The frequent data swaps between matrix multiplications on the systolic array\nand softmax operations on external units result in low array utilization.\nMoreover, when these computations run concurrently, the softmax stage contends\nwith matrix multiplication for register file and SRAM ports, further degrading\nperformance.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose FSA, an enhanced systolic array\narchitecture that enables the FlashAttention algorithm to run entirely within a\nsingle systolic array, eliminating the need for external vector units. At the\ncore of FSA is SystolicAttention, a novel scheduling algorithm that maps\nFlashAttention operations onto systolic arrays with fine-grained, element-wise\noverlap. This approach significantly improves array utilization while\npreserving the original floating-point operation order to maintain numerical\nstability.\n  We implement FSA in synthesizable RTL and evaluate its performance against\nstate-of-the-art commercial accelerators.

    "abstract": "The paper describes the objectives, design and findings of the pre-launch\nground characterisation campaigns of the Euclid infrared detectors. The pixel\nproperties, including baseline, bad pixels, quantum efficiency, inter pixel\ncapacitance, quantum efficiency, dark current, readout noise, conversion gain,\nresponse nonlinearity, and image persistence were measured and characterised\nfor each pixel. We describe in detail the test flow definition that allows us\nto derive the pixel properties and we present the data acquisition and data\nquality check software implemented for this purpose. We also outline the\nmeasurement protocols of all the pixel properties presented and we provide a\ncomprehensive overview of the performance of the Euclid infrared detectors as\nderived after tuning the operating parameters of the detectors. The main\nconclusion of this work is that the performance of the infrared detectors\nEuclid meets the requirements. Pixels classified as non-functioning accounted\nfor less than 0.2% of all science pixels. IPC coupling is minimal and crosstalk\nbetween adjacent pixels is less than 1% between adjacent pixels. 95% of the\npixels show a QE greater than 80% across the entire spectral range of the\nEuclid mission. The conversion gain is approximately 0.52 ADU/e-, with a\nvariation less than 1% between channels of the same detector. The reset noise\nis approximately equal to 23 ADU after reference pixels correction. The readout\nnoise of a single frame is approximately 13 $e^-$ while the signal estimator\nnoise is measured at 7 $e^-$ in photometric mode and 9 $e^-$ in spectroscopic\nacquisition mode. The deviation from linear response at signal levels up to 80\nk$e^-$ is less than 5% for 95% of the pixels. Median persistence amplitudes are\nless than 0.3% of the signal, though persistence exhibits significant spatial\nvariation and differences between detectors.",

    "abstract": "Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for\nreliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to\ncomplex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited\nannotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions\nAdaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity\nNetwork (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically\ncombines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a\nwavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a\nbiologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature\nenhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained\nand continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate\nuncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and\nlightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without\nsacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate\nthat HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an\naverage symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap\nerror (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the\n3D-IRCADb-01 dataset obtains an average Dice of 87.45%, IoU of 80.30%, ASSD of\n1.525 mm, and VOE of 19.71%, indicating strong generalization across different\ndatasets. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of HANS-Net in\nproviding anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor\nsegmentation.",

To make the actual risk associated with the privacy budget more\ntransparent, multiple privacy metrics (PMs) have been proposed to assess the\nprivacy risk of the data.

While various forms of argumentation have been shown to support\ncontestability, Edge-Weighted Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks\n(EW-QBAFs) have received little attention. In this work, we show how EW-QBAFs\ncan be deployed for this purpose. Specifically, we introduce the contestability\nproblem for EW-QBAFs, which asks how to modify edge weights (e.g., preferences)\nto achieve a desired strength for a specific argument of interest (i.e., a\ntopic argument). To address this problem, we propose gradient-based relation\nattribution explanations (G-RAEs), which quantify the sensitivity of the topic\nargument's strength to changes in individual edge weights, thus providing\ninterpretable guidance for weight adjustments towards contestability. Building\non G-RAEs, we develop an iterative algorithm that progressively adjusts the\nedge weights to attain the desired strength. We evaluate our approach\nexperimentally on synthetic EW-QBAFs that simulate the structural\ncharacteristics of personalised recommender systems and multi-layer\nperceptrons, and demonstrate that it can solve the problem effectively.",

Modeled as directed graphs with\nnon-reciprocal hopping, these systems reveal quantized decay charges, defined\nas the sum of decay constants along edges at each node, offering a novel\ntopological invariant. We derive universal conditions for these modes, enabling\nversatile configurations from one-dimensional rings, directed graphs with\ncomplicated connectivity, to higher-dimensional lattices. Experimental\nvalidation using microwave resonant circuits confirms the predicted pure decay\nprofiles.

However, while 3D objects can be of complex and diverse shapes\nin the real world, existing GS-based methods only limitedly use a single type\nof splatting primitive (Gaussian ellipse or Gaussian ellipsoid) to represent\nobject surfaces during their reconstruction. In this paper, we highlight that\nthis can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality.\nThus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian\nSplatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its\nsurface reconstruction process. Specifically, in our framework, we first\npropose a compositional splatting strategy, enabling the splatting and\nrendering of different types of primitives in the Gaussian Splatting pipeline.\nIn addition, we also design our framework with a mixed-primitive-based\ninitialization strategy and a vertex pruning mechanism to further promote its\nsurface representation learning process to be well executed leveraging\ndifferent types of primitives. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our\nframework and its accurate surface reconstruction performance.",

Consequently, we numerically investigate the plausibility of this\nlimit for the particular case of a chain with $\\beta$-FPUT interactions and\nharmonic pinning. We present our simulation results suggesting that the\nconjectured PDE for the limiting temperature profile and Green--Kubo type\nformula for the limiting energy current conjectured are correct. We then use\nthis Green--Kubo type formula to investigate the relationship between the\nenergy current and period of the forcing.

    "abstract": "In this study, various nanoparticle species-including Au and Gd$_2$O$_3$-were\nirradiated with low-energy gamma rays, such as 59.5 keV photons from\n$^{241}$Am. Pulse-height spectra were recorded using a liquid-scintillation\ncounting system before and after dispersing the nanoparticles into the\nscintillator, and the differences between them were analyzed to infer the\ninteraction outcomes. Gd$_2$O$_3$ nanoparticles emitted numerous electrons;\nhowever, under identical experimental conditions, no detectable electron\nemission was observed from Au nanoparticles (AuNPs). Here, \"detectable electron\nemission\" refers to electrons with energies high enough to be registered by the\nliquid-scintillation detector used (approx 100 eV and, more typically, >= 1-2\nkeV); however, it excludes electrons that may be emitted at lower energies.\nThus, a species-dependent radiation-nanoparticle interaction was observed.\nRigorous controls and falsification tests excluded various artefacts-including\ndetector insensitivity, surface contamination, aggregation, quenching, and\nself-absorption-as causes for the absence of detectable electron emission from\nAuNPs. This observation potentially prompts a re-evaluation of the common\nassumption that nanoparticles behave like their bulk counterparts and emit\nelectrons upon gamma-irradiation. Instead, our results suggest that the\ndistinct internal environment of nanoparticles influences their interaction\nwith radiation.

This is known as trajectory\ninference. If the process is differentiation, this amounts to reconstructing\nthe corresponding differentiation tree. One way of doing this in practice is to\nestimate the shortest-path distance between nodes based on cell similarities\nobserved in sequencing data. Recent sequencing techniques make it possible to\nmeasure two types of data: gene expression levels, and RNA velocity, a vector\nthat predicts changes in gene expression. The data then consist of a discrete\nvector field on a (subset of a) Euclidean space of dimension equal to the\nnumber of genes under consideration. By integrating this velocity field, we\ntrace the evolution of gene expression levels in each single cell from some\ninitial stage to its current stage. Eventually, we assume that we have a\nfaithful embedding of the differentiation tree in a Euclidean space, but which\nwe only observe through the curves representing the paths from the root to the\nnodes.

However, traditional approaches typically treat\nthis task as a static classification problem, relying on handcrafted features\nor isolated deep learning models. These methods often lack the robustness\nneeded to handle incomplete, heterogeneous, or noisy intelligence, and they\nprovide limited transparency in decision-making-factors that reduce their\neffectiveness in real-world threat environments. To address these limitations,\nwe propose LRCTI, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework designed for\nmulti-step CTI credibility verification. The framework first employs a text\nsummarization module to distill complex intelligence reports into concise and\nactionable threat claims. It then uses an adaptive multi-step evidence\nretrieval mechanism that iteratively identifies and refines supporting\ninformation from a CTI-specific corpus, guided by LLM feedback. Finally, a\nprompt-based Natural Language Inference (NLI) module is applied to evaluate the\ncredibility of each claim while generating interpretable justifications for the\nclassification outcome. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets,\nCTI-200 and PolitiFact show that LRCTI improves F1-Macro and F1-Micro scores by\nover 5%, reaching 90.9% and 93.6%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines.

Particularly,\nit seems that for generative SE methods, subjective (ACR MOS) and objective\n(DNSMOS, NISQA) reference-free metrics should be accompanied by objective phone\nfidelity metrics to reliably detect hallucinations. Finally, we will soon\nrelease our localization scripts and methods for easy deployment for new\nmultilingual speech enhancement subjective evaluations according to ITU-T\nP.808.",

Due to the low distance to the source and its\nintrinsically high luminosity MAXI J1820$+$070 was observed extensively over\nthis time period, resulting in high-cadence and quasi-simultaneous observations\nacross the electromagnetic spectrum. These data sets provide the opportunity to\nprobe the connection between accretion and the launch of jets in greater detail\nthan for the majority of black hole X-ray binaries. In this work we present\nradio (Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array, MeerKAT), X-ray (Swift), and\noptical (Las Cumbres Observatory) observations of MAXI J1820$+$070 throughout\nits entire outburst, including its initial hard state, subsequent soft state,\nand further hard-state-only re-brightenings (covering March 2018 to August\n2022). Due to the regularity and temporal density of our observational data we\nare able to create a Radio - X-ray - Optical activity plane where we find a\nhigh degree of correlation between the three wave bands during the hard states,\nand observe hysteresis as MAXI J1820$+$070 enters and exits the soft state.\nBased on the morphology of the optical light curves we see evidence for optical\njet contributions during the soft-to-hard state transition, as well as fading\noptical emission well before the hard to soft transition. We establish that the\nremarkably similar profiles of the re-brightening events are broadly consistent\nwith modified disk instability models where irradiation from the inner\naccretion disk is included.",

Real-world flight tests\ndemonstrate that our combination of event camera and low-latency neural network\nis capable of replacing the inertial measurement unit in a traditional flight\ncontrol loop. Furthermore, we investigate the network's generalization across\ndifferent environments, and the impact of memory and different fields of view.\nWhile networks with memory and access to horizon-like visual cues achieve best\nperformance, variants with a narrower field of view achieve better relative\ngeneralization.

Consequently, studying and developing imputation methods has\nbeen an active field of research over the last decade. Faced with an imputation\ntask and a large number of methods, how does one find the most suitable\nimputation? Although model selection in different contexts, such as prediction,\nhas been well studied, this question appears not to have received much\nattention. In this paper, we follow the concept of Imputation Scores (I-Scores)\nand develop a new, reliable, and easy-to-implement score to rank missing value\nimputations for a given data set without access to the complete data. In\npractice, this is usually done by artificially masking observations to compare\nimputed to observed values using measures such as the Root Mean Squared Error\n(RMSE). We discuss how this approach of additionally masking observations can\nbe misleading if not done carefully and that it is generally not valid under\nMAR. We then identify a new missingness assumption and develop a score that\ncombines a sensible masking of observations with proper scoring rules. As such\nthe ranking is geared towards the imputation that best replicates the\ndistribution of the data, allowing to find imputations that are suitable for a\nrange of downstream tasks. We show the propriety of the score and discuss an\nestimation algorithm involving energy scores. Finally, we show the efficacy of\nthe new score in simulated data examples, as well as a downstream task.",

This paper\npresents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR),\nwhich leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the\n3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning\n(DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based\nconstraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages:\ni) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\\ell/z_o$), where $\\ell$\nis the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic\nsensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging\nspatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for\nthe position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\\ell$), current ($I$), and current\nflow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer\nthen adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\\ell$, $I$) to\nminimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI.

    "abstract": "Permutation patterns and pattern avoidance are central, well-studied concepts\nin combinatorics and computer science. Given two permutations $\\tau$ and $\\pi$,\nthe pattern matching problem (PPM) asks whether $\\tau$ contains $\\pi$. This\nproblem arises in various contexts in computer science and statistics and has\nbeen studied extensively in exact-, parameterized-, approximate-,\nproperty-testing- and other formulations.\n  In this paper, we study pattern matching in a streaming setting, when the\ninput $\\tau$ is revealed sequentially, one element at a time. There is\nextensive work on the space complexity of various statistics in streams of\nintegers. The novelty of our setting is that the input stream is a permutation,\nwhich allows inferring some information about future inputs. Our algorithms\ncrucially take advantage of this fact, while existing lower bound techniques\nbecome difficult to apply.\n  We show that the complexity of the problem changes dramatically depending on\nthe pattern $\\pi$. The space requirement is: $\\Theta(k\\log{n})$ for the\nmonotone patterns $\\pi = 12\\dots k$, or $\\pi = k\\dots21$, $O(\\sqrt{n\\log{n}})$\nfor $\\pi \\in \\{312,132\\}$, $O(\\sqrt{n} \\log n)$ for $\\pi \\in \\{231,213\\}$, and\n$\\widetilde{\\Theta}_{\\pi}(n)$ for all other $\\pi$.

This paper\ninvestigates the optimization of the sensing accuracy of a UAV swarm deployed\nto perform multi-baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)\nsensing. In conventional single-baseline InSAR systems, only one synthetic\naperture radar (SAR) antenna pair acquires two SAR images from two distinct\nangles to generate a digital elevation model (DEM) of the target area. However,\nmulti-baseline InSAR extends this concept by aggregating multiple acquisitions\nfrom different angles, thus, significantly enhancing the vertical accuracy of\nthe DEM. The heavy computations required for this process are performed on the\nground and, therefore, the radar data is transmitted in real time to a ground\nstation (GS) via a frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) air-to-ground\nbackhaul link. This work focuses on improving the sensing precision by\nminimizing the height error of the averaged DEM while simultaneously ensuring\nsensing and communication quality-of-service (QoS). To this end, the UAV\nformation, velocity, and communication power allocation are jointly optimized\nusing evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Our approach is benchmarked against\nestablished optimization methods, including genetic algorithms (GAs), simulated\nannealing (SA), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques.

However, the recent abundance and precision of\nobservational data shows that this problem is far from solved. A modern\napproach should be developed by using multidimensional models.\n  Aims. We established a new theoretical framework for comparison between\none-dimensional and multidimensional convection models by mapping the\ntwo-dimensional structure of the convective zone and optimizing the modeling\nparameters of the SPHERLS code.\n  Methods. We constructed a series of static envelope models for the same RR\nLyrae stars, but with different horizontal sizes and resolutions. We then used\na series of statistical methods to quantify the sizes of convective eddies, map\nthe energy cascade, and describe the different structural parts of the\nconvective zone. These include integral length scales, Fourier series, and the\ndetermination of the convective flux through horizontal averaging.\n  Results. The structure of the convective zone depends significantly on the\nmodel size, below an angular size of $9^\\circ$. The horizontal resolution of\nearlier studies is adequate to describe the granulation pattern in the large\neddy simulation approach. In quasi-static RR Lyrae stars, the convective zone\nconsists of two distinct dynamically unstable regions that are loosely\nconnected. Approximately half of the convective flux is supplied by the\ntransport of ionization energy in the partial hydrogen ionization zone.\n  Conclusions. The 2D models presented in this work with the described size and\nresolution parameters can be used for comparison against 1D models. The\nstructure of the convective zone urges reconsideration of some recent\napproaches to describe the convective flux currently used in radial stellar\npulsation codes, which will be addressed in a separate paper.",

We find time scale\nentanglement to be a system-inherent property becoming maximal at phase\ntransitions and crossover, which translates to peaks in the quantics tensor\ntrain bond dimension of correlator functions.

Using a full microscopic model that includes cascaded Lindblad\ndynamics and chiral emitter-bath couplings, we reveal how the topology of the\nbath mediates nonreciprocal, long-range interactions between emitters.

    "abstract": "Upon the impact of a flat disk on a boiling liquid, i.e., a liquid that is in\nthermal equilibrium with its own vapor, a thin vapor layer is entrapped under\nthe disk. Due to the tendency of vapor to undergo phase change under pressure\nvariation upon impact, the dynamics of this entrapped vapor pocket are\ndifferent from those of a non-condensable air pocket. In this work, we\nexperimentally investigate the dynamics of the entrapped vapor pocket, more\nspecifically its time evolution and its subsequent influence on the\nhydrodynamic loads at different equilibrium ambient temperatures and impact\nvelocities. We find that the retraction of the vapor pocket at high ambient\ntemperature and small impact velocity is slow, occurring from the disk edge,\nand driven by the dynamic pressure $\\rho_{\\text{L}}U_0^2$. In contrast, at\nlower ambient temperatures and large impact velocities, after a short initial\nstage, the vapor pocket will collapse rapidly due to condensation. This\nscenario is confirmed by conducting experiments where, by heating the disk, the\nvapor pocket collapse is observed to slow down. We attribute this to the\nvaporization of liquid near the three-phase contact line region that frustrates\nthe condensation process and reduces the impact pressure on the disk. The\nviolent collapse of the vapor pocket may impart additional instantaneous\nmomentum, but the overall pressure and force impulses are still found to be\nclosely associated with the liquid added mass. Finally, we found that at a high\ntilt angle of the disk, the three-phase contact line movement over the disk\nsurface may hinder the proper entrapment and compression of the vapor pocket,\nwhich results in a lower central impact pressure as rapid condensation at the\ncentral disk region does not occur.",

However, existing methods struggle with disentangling\ntargets from anchors in complex multi-anchor queries and resolving\ninconsistencies in spatial descriptions caused by perspective variations. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose ViewSRD, a framework that formulates 3D\nvisual grounding as a structured multi-view decomposition process. First, the\nSimple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor\nqueries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a\nstructured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional\nrelationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the\nMulti-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates\ntextual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal\nConsistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a\nTextual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a\nunified and robust 3D visual grounding. Experiments on 3D visual grounding\ndatasets show that ViewSRD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nparticularly in complex queries requiring precise spatial differentiation.

The existence and stability of such dynamics\n[Merle-Rapha\\\"el-Szeftel, 2010] and construction of suitable profiles\n[Bahri-Martel-Rapha\\\"el, 2021] lead to the question of asymptotic stability.\nBased on our previous work [Li, 2023], this nonlinear problem is reduced to\nlinear mode stability of the matrix linearized operator. In this work, we prove\nmode stability for the low-energy spectrum in $d \\ge 1$ as a perturbation of\nthe linearized operator around ground state for mass-critical NLS. The main\ndifficulty of this spectral bifurcation problem arises from the\nnon-self-adjoint, relatively unbounded and high-dimensional nature, for which\nwe exploit the Jost function argument from [Perelman, 2001], qualitative WKB\nanalysis generalized from [Bahri-Martel-Rapha\\\"el, 2021], matched asymptotics\nmethod and uniform estimates for high spherical classes based on special\nfunctions.",

    "abstract": "Within a legal framework, fairness in datasets and models is typically\nassessed by dividing observations into predefined groups and then computing\nfairness measures (e.g., Disparate Impact or Equality of Odds with respect to\ngender). However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous,\ndividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination\nexperienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we\npropose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly\nmultidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed\nlevels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a\nnovel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby\nisolating the most critical subgroups.\n  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and\ndemonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing\nhow discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.\nFurthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the\ncase of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging\nthe skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that\nthe proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than\npreviously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for\na given model. Finally, we leverage our grouping model for debiasing purpose,\naiming at predicting fair scores with group-by-group post-processing. The\nresults demonstrate that our approach improves fairness while having minimal\nimpact on accuracy, thus confirming our partition method and opening the door\nfor industrial deployment.",

However, due\nto the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video\ngeneration models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on\nbenchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our\nknowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively\nevaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models.\nInspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative\nunit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative\nAtom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness.\nGuided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we\nconstruct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing\nevaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based\non the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an\neffective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and\nanswering framework.

Decidability of\nthe problem is open in general, with the most notable positive result being a\ndecision procedure for LRS of order at most 4.\n  In this paper we consider a bounded version of the Skolem Problem, in which\nthe input consists of an LRS $\\langle u_n \\rangle_{n=0}^\\infty$ and a bound $N\n\\in \\mathbb N$ (with all integers written in binary), and the task is to\ndetermine whether there exists $n\\in\\{0,\\ldots,N\\}$ such that $u_n=0$.

    "abstract": "Neural networks have become the dominant technique for accurate pitch and\nperiodicity estimation. Although a lot of research has gone into improving\nnetwork architectures and training paradigms, most approaches operate directly\non the raw audio waveform or on general-purpose time-frequency representations.\nWe investigate the use of Sawtooth-Inspired Pitch Estimation (SWIPE) kernels as\nan audio frontend and find that these hand-crafted, task-specific features can\nmake neural pitch estimators more accurate, robust to noise, and more\nparameter-efficient. We evaluate supervised and self-supervised\nstate-of-the-art architectures on common datasets and show that the SWIPE audio\nfrontend allows for reducing the network size by an order of magnitude without\nperformance degradation. Additionally, we show that the SWIPE algorithm on its\nown is much more accurate than commonly reported, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised neural pitch estimators.",

    "abstract": "The source GS~1826-24 is a neutron star low mass X-ray binary known as the\n'clocked burster' because of its extremely regular bursting behavior. We report\non the detection of a long type-I X-ray burst from this source. We perform a\ndetailed spectroscopic analysis of the long X-ray burst, lasting for $\\sim 600$\ns, seen in the NuSTAR observation carried out on 2022 September. The persistent\nemission is well described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model\n(nthcomp), and the source exhibits a soft spectral state during this\nobservation. The observed burst exhibits a rise time of $\\sim 25$ s and a decay\ntime of $\\sim 282$ s. The time-resolved spectroscopy of the burst shows a\nsignificant departure from a pure thermal spectrum and is described with a\nmodel consisting of a varying-temperature blackbody plus an evolving persistent\nemission component. We observe a significant enhancement in the persistent\nemission during the burst. The enhancement of the pre-burst persistent flux is\npossibly due to Poynting-Robertson drag or coronal reprocessing. At the peak of\nthe burst, the blackbody temperature and the blackbody emitting radius reached\na maximum of $2.10\\pm 0.07$ keV and $5.5\\pm 2.1$ km, respectively. The peak\nflux ($F_{peak}$) during the burst is $\\approx 2.4\\times 10^{-8}$ ergs\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a luminosity of $\\approx 9.7\\times\n10^{37}$ ergs s$^{-1}$.",

Existing studies often focus on individual neurons, but their\npolysemantic nature makes it difficult to isolate language-specific units from\ncross-lingual representations. To address this, we explore sparse autoencoders\n(SAEs) for their ability to learn monosemantic features that represent concrete\nand abstract concepts across languages in LLMs. While some of these features\nare language-independent, the presence of language-specific features remains\nunderexplored. In this work, we introduce SAE-LAPE, a method based on feature\nactivation probability, to identify language-specific features within the\nfeed-forward network. We find that many such features predominantly appear in\nthe middle to final layers of the model and are interpretable. These features\ninfluence the model's multilingual performance and language output and can be\nused for language identification with performance comparable to fastText along\nwith more interpretability.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for enabling knowledge reasoning across\nvarious domains. Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and\nlocal information have achieved promising results. However, existing methods\noften suffer from score over-smoothing, which blurs the distinction between\ncorrect and incorrect answers and hinders reasoning effectiveness. To address\nthis, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with\ndual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by\nsegregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message\npassing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways,\npreventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination.\nIn addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which\npartitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the\ncandidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which\nalleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality. Extensive experiments\non various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance, with up to an 8.7% improvement in reasoning quality and a\n1.8$\\times$ acceleration in training efficiency.",

In the non-separable case, however, it has been shown that GD can\nexhibit a cycling behaviour even when the step sizes is still below the\nstability threshold $2/\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is the largest eigenvalue of\nthe Hessian at the solution. This short paper explores whether restricting the\ndata to have equal magnitude is a sufficient condition for global convergence,\nunder any step size below the stability threshold.

    "abstract": "The variation in hot Jupiter (HJ) occurrence across stellar environments\nholds clues as to the dominant formation channels of these extreme planets.\nRecent studies suggest HJ hosts preferentially reside in regions of high phase\nspace density, possibly reflecting natal environmental conditions. These\nregions are kinematically cold (|v| < 40 km/s), prompting the alternative\nhypothesis that the correlation reflects an age bias: planetary systems in\noverdensities are systematically younger and therefore less likely to have\nundergone tidal inspiral and destruction. We test whether the apparent excess\nof HJs in phase space overdensities arises from differences in intrinsic host\nproperties -- mass, metallicity, age -- which may correlate with phase space\ndensity or whether there is evidence for an additional environmental effect. We\nderive homogeneous estimates for the mass, metallicity, and age of\nplanet-hosting stars using 2MASS and Gaia DR3 photometry, parallaxes, and\nself-consistent spectroscopic and spectrophotometric observables. In a sample\nof 2265 confirmed exoplanet hosts, we find a significant relative excess of HJs\norbiting stars in overdense regions. However, we also find that overdensities\npreferentially host younger, more massive, and more metal-rich stars compared\nto underdensities. After correcting for these differences, either by detrending\nthe phase space density against age or by matching host properties across\nsubsamples, we find no significant differences in the HJ populations between\nover- and underdense regions. Our results suggest that the previously reported\ncorrelation between HJ occurrence and phase space density is driven by\nunderlying differences in host star demographics rather than an intrinsic\nenvironmental effect.",

Since some applications\nfavor straight edges, we also study two problem variants in which the output\nregions must be polygons, but are not restricted to have boundaries from a\nfixed subdivision. In the first variant, region vertices must lie on the\nboundaries of the input polygons. The second variant requires them to be\nvertices of the input polygons.

This suppression, referred to as suppressed emotion,\noften stems from well-meaning but value-driven communication, which is\ndifficult to detect or address from outside the family. Focusing on these\nlatent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support\nfor psychologically safe family communication. We constructed a Japanese\nparent-child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on\nideal parent bias and suppressed emotion. Based on this corpus, we developed a\nRole-Playing LLM-based multi-agent dialogue support framework that analyzes\ndialogue and generates feedback. Specialized agents detect suppressed emotion,\ndescribe implicit ideal parent bias in parental speech, and infer contextual\nattributes such as the child's age and background. A meta-agent compiles these\noutputs into a structured report, which is then passed to five selected expert\nagents. These agents collaboratively generate empathetic and actionable\nfeedback through a structured four-step discussion process. Experiments show\nthat the system can detect categories of suppressed emotion with moderate\naccuracy and produce feedback rated highly in empathy and practicality.\nMoreover, simulated follow-up dialogues incorporating this feedback exhibited\nsigns of improved emotional expression and mutual understanding, suggesting the\nframework's potential in supporting positive transformation in family\ninteractions.",

However, while the southwestern emission can\nbe explained by standard Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA), the northeastern\nside may involve re-acceleration of pre-existing cosmic rays or acceleration\nvia reflected shocks in the dense cloud environment. Additionally, we identify\ntwo significant $\\gamma$-ray excesses outside the remnant, including a\npreviously unreported source to the south. These features are likely produced\nby cosmic rays that have escaped Puppis A and are interacting with nearby dense\nmolecular material. From this extended emission, we estimate the total energy\nin escaping cosmic rays to be $W_{CR} \\sim 1.5 \\times 10^{49}$ erg, providing\nimportant constraints on cosmic-ray propagation around the remnant.",

While existing methods attempt to address various\nincomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality\ncombination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical\nlimitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict\nwith each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction\nmodel. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank\nadaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a\nnovel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal\nlearning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination\naware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The\nMCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct\ncharacteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts\nthe training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each\nmodality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across\ndifferent modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in\nmultiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms\nprevious incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration\nhas ushered in a new era of observational astronomy, emphasizing the need for\nrapid and detailed parameter estimation and population-level analyses.\nTraditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo,\nface significant computational challenges when dealing with the\nhigh-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in\ngravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of\nsimulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a\nfocus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as\nnormalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive\noverview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based\ninference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio\nestimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency\nmodels. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse\ngravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter\nestimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and\nconducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed\nimprovements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their\nmodel-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to\ntheir widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of\nconventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter\nspaces and noise conditions.",

The present work aims to analyze the characteristics of ZLK\noscillations within this extended framework, focusing on phase-space\nstructures, the location of ZLK center, the maximum eccentricity reached, the\nboundaries of librating cycles, and the critical inclination required to\ntrigger ZLK resonance. Under the extended Hamiltonian, we introduce the Lidov\nintegral C_ZLK, which is a combination of the Hamiltonian and the z-component\nof angular momentum, to characterize the modified ZLK properties. It is found\nthat the librating and circulating cycles are separated by C_ZLK=0, which is\nconsistent with the classical theory. Furthermore, we derive analytical\nexpressions of these ZLK properties using perturbation techniques. Analytical\npredictions are compared to numerical results, showing an excellent agreement\nbetween them.

Specifically, we realize the efficient\nverification with a favorable scaling of the required number of copies versus\ninfidelity as $-1.39$, outperforming the standard quantum limit of $-2$.\nMeanwhile, a fidelity of $97.07(\\pm 0.26)\\%$ via direct estimation is achieved\nusing only $9$ measurement settings and $10^4$ samples, which is independently\nconfirmed by quantum state tomography to be $98.58(\\pm 0.12)\\%$ with\napproximately $10^6$ measurements. This work presents the first experimental\ndemonstration of QSV actively assisted with state preparation, establishing it\nas a powerful and resource-efficient alternative to full tomography for\nreal-time quantum state engineering.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural\nnetwork-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these\nmodels have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most\nexisting approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the\nconstruction of a separate model for each time series, which results in\nsubstantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing\npenalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal\nrelationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To\naddress these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural\nGranger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model\nand applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and\noutput to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific\ntime series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures\nsuch as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical\nsimulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC\noutperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational\noverhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder\nurothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in\nreconstructing gene regulatory networks.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely on global navigation\nsatellite system (GNSS) pseudorange measurements for accurate real-time\nlocalization and navigation. However, this dependence exposes them to\nsophisticated spoofing threats, where adversaries manipulate pseudoranges to\ndeceive UAV receivers. Among these, drift-evasive spoofing attacks subtly\nperturb measurements, gradually diverting the UAVs trajectory without\ntriggering conventional signal-level anti-spoofing mechanisms. Traditional\ndistributional shift detection techniques often require accumulating a\nthreshold number of samples, causing delays that impede rapid detection and\ntimely response. Consequently, robust temporal-scale detection methods are\nessential to identify attack onset and enable contingency planning with\nalternative sensing modalities, improving resilience against stealthy\nadversarial manipulations. This study explores a Bayesian online change point\ndetection (BOCPD) approach that monitors temporal shifts in value estimates\nfrom a reinforcement learning (RL) critic network to detect subtle behavioural\ndeviations in UAV navigation. Experimental results show that this temporal\nvalue-based framework outperforms conventional GNSS spoofing detectors,\ntemporal semi-supervised learning frameworks, and the Page-Hinkley test,\nachieving higher detection accuracy and lower false-positive and false-negative\nrates for drift-evasive spoofing attacks.",

In this\nstudy, we present a procedure to derive theoretical upper bounds on the kinetic\nmixing parameter $\\varepsilon^2(M_U)$ by analyzing dilepton spectra from\nheavy-ion collisions across a broad energy range, from SIS to LHC energies. Our\nanalysis is based on the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD)\ntransport approach, which successfully reproduces the measured dilepton spectra\nin $p+p$, $p+A$, and $A+A$ collisions across the same energy range. Besides the\ndilepton channels resulting from interactions and decays of Standard Model\nparticles (such as mesons and baryons), the PHSD has been extended to include\nthe decay of hypothetical dark photons into dileptons, $U \\to e^+ e^-$. The\nproduction of these dark photons occurs via Dalitz decays of $\\pi^0$, $\\eta$,\n$\\omega$, $\\eta^{\\prime}$, and $\\Delta$ resonances; direct decays of $\\rho$,\n$\\omega$, and $\\phi$; the kaon mode $K^+ \\to \\pi^+ U$; and thermal $q\\bar q$\nannihilation in the quark-gluon plasma.

    "abstract": "In recent years, contrastive learning has achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance in the territory of self-supervised representation learning. Many\nprevious works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding\nunderlying the success of contrastive learning. Almost all of them rely on a\ndefault assumption, i.e., the label consistency assumption, which may not hold\nin practice (the probability of failure is called labeling error) due to the\nstrength and randomness of common augmentation strategies, such as random\nresized crop (RRC). This paper investigates the theoretical impact of labeling\nerror on the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. We\nfirst reveal several significant negative impacts of labeling error on\ndownstream classification risk. To mitigate these impacts, data dimensionality\nreduction method (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD) is applied on\noriginal data to reduce false positive samples, and establish both theoretical\nand empirical evaluations. Moreover, it is also found that SVD acts as a\ndouble-edged sword, which may lead to the deterioration of downstream\nclassification accuracy due to the reduced connectivity of the augmentation\ngraph. Based on the above observations, we give the augmentation suggestion\nthat we should use some moderate embedding dimension (such as $512, 1024$ in\nour experiments), data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD to ensure large\ngraph connectivity and small labeling error to improve model performance.",

The vertical shear instability (VSI) is one of the candidate\nturbulence-driving mechanisms in the outer disk region. Since the VSI requires\nrapid gas cooling, dust grains in disks can influence and potentially control\nVSI-driven turbulence. However, VSI-driven turbulence has strong vertical\nmotion, causing vertical dust diffusion. As a result, it remains unclear how\nturbulent structures and dust distributions form. We aim to clarify whether the\nVSI can achieve a quasi-steady dust profile under cooling rate evolution\nassociated with turbulently diffusing dust. We also elucidate the dependence of\nthe dust size and dust-to-gas mass ratio on the realization and persistence of\nthe equilibrium state. We perform global two-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations of an axisymmetric disk to investigate how the VSI drives\nturbulence and maintains a balance between dust settling and diffusion. These\nsimulations account for the dynamic interplay between dust distribution,\ncooling rates, and turbulence. We find that VSI mixing, dust settling, and\nlocal cooling reach an equilibrium, forming a thick dust layer with a\ndimensionless vertical mixing coefficient of approximately 10^{-3}. The ability\nof the VSI to sustain this state also depends on the dust size and dust-to-gas\nmass ratio. Larger grains or lower mass ratios weaken turbulence, leading to\ndust settling. The condition of equilibrium state existence is consistent with\nthe prediction of the semi-analytic model presented by Fukuhara & Okuzumi\n(2024). Our results indicate that efficient turbulent dust mixing and efficient\ncooling can occur simultaneously. They also imply that turbulence in\nVSI-dominated disks has different intensity levels depending on the grain size.\nThis suggests that the efficiency of dust growth can depend on the VSI in\nprotoplanetary disks.",

    "abstract": "In the design of integrated circuits, one critical metric is the maximum\ndelay introduced by combinational modules within the circuit. This delay is\ncrucial because it represents the time required to perform a computation: in an\nArithmetic-Logic Unit it represents the maximum time taken by the circuit to\nperform an arithmetic operation. When such a circuit is part of a larger,\nsynchronous system, like a CPU, the maximum delay directly impacts the maximum\nclock frequency of the entire system. Typically, hardware designers use Static\nTiming Analysis to compute an upper bound of the maximum delay because it can\nbe determined in polynomial time. However, relying on this upper bound can lead\nto suboptimal processor speeds, thereby missing performance opportunities. In\nthis work, we tackle the challenging task of computing the actual maximum\ndelay, rather than an approximate value. Since the problem is computationally\nhard, we model it in Answer Set Programming (ASP), a logic language featuring\nextremely efficient solvers. We propose non-trivial encodings of the problem\ninto ASP. Experimental results show that ASP is a viable solution to address\ncomplex problems in hardware design.",

Our focus is primarily on\npositive $2\\times2$ block operator matrices in Hilbert spaces. Subsequently, we\nexamine the analogous problem for operators that attain their minimum modulus\non every nonzero closed subspace; these are referred to as absolutely minimum\nattaining operators (or $\\mathcal{AM}$-operators, in short). We provide\nconditions under which these operators belong to the operator norm closure of\nthe above two classes. In addition, we give a characterization of idempotent\noperators that fall into these three classes. Finally, we illustrate our\nresults through examples that involve concrete operators.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, landslide disasters have reported frequently due to the\nextreme weather events of droughts, floods , storms, or the consequence of\nhuman activities such as deforestation, excessive exploitation of natural\nresources. However, automatically observing landslide is challenging due to the\nextremely large observing area and the rugged topography such as mountain or\nhighland. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end deep-learning-based model\nwhich explores the remote sensing images for automatically observing landslide\nevents. By considering remote sensing images as the input data, we can obtain\nfree resource, observe large and rough terrains by time. To explore the remote\nsensing images, we proposed a novel neural network architecture which is for\ntwo tasks of landslide detection and landslide segmentation. We evaluated our\nproposed model on three different benchmark datasets of LandSlide4Sense, Bijie,\nand Nepal. By conducting extensive experiments, we achieve F1 scores of 98.23,\n93.83 for the landslide detection task on LandSlide4Sense, Bijie datasets; mIoU\nscores of 63.74, 76.88 on the segmentation tasks regarding LandSlide4Sense,\nNepal datasets.

Our approach is efficient in terms of the number of queries to the\nblock encoding of a Hamiltonian. Also, our approach can avoid Suzuki-Trotter\ndecomposition. We constructed quantum circuits for GQSP-based quantum power\nmethods, estimated the number of queries, and numerically verified that this\nframework works. We additionally benchmark various quantum power methods with\nmolecular Hamiltonians and demonstrate that Quantum Power Lanczos converges\nfaster and more reliably than standard Quantum Power Iteration, while Quantum\nInverse Iteration outperforms existing inverse iteration variants based on\ntime-evolution operators. We also show that the Quantum Folded Spectrum Method\ncan obtain excited states without variational optimization. Overall, our\nresults indicate that GQSP-based implementations of power methods combine\nscalability, flexibility, and robust convergence, paving the way for practical\ninitial state preparations on fault-tolerant quantum devices.",

    "abstract": "We present a new algorithm for integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction of\nFeynman integrals with high powers of numerators or propagators, a demanding\ncomputational step in evaluating multi-loop scattering amplitudes. The\nalgorithm starts with solving syzygy equations in individual sectors to produce\nIBP operators that turn seed integrals into IBP equations without artificially\nraised propagator powers. The IBP operators are expressed in terms of\nindex-shift operators and number operators. We perform row reduction to\nsystematically reshuffle the IBP operators and expose reduction rules with\nsymbolic dependence on the powers of propagators and numerators. When this is\ninsufficient, we produce more symbolic reduction rules by directly solving the\nlinear system of IBP equations in which some propagator/numerator powers are\nkept symbolic. This linear system is kept small, as the equations are generated\nfrom a small set of seed integrals in the neighborhood of the target integral.\nWe stress-test our algorithm against two highly non-trivial examples, namely\nrank-20 integrals for the double box with an external mass and the massless\npentabox. As an application, we revisit the IBP reduction in a calculation of\nscattering amplitudes for spinning black hole binary systems, which involves\ntwo-loop Feynman integrals with complexity greater than 20, and achieve much\nfaster IBP reduction than that of the original calculation.",

The stratosphere at 30-40 km altitude closely\nresembles the surface of Mars in terms of pressure, temperature, and radiation\nlevels (UV, proton, and Galactic cosmic rays). While microbial life in the\ntroposphere is well documented, the true upper limit of Earth's biosphere\nremains unclear. The stratosphere offers a promising environment to explore\nmicrobial survival in such extreme conditions. Despite its significance to\nastrobiology, this region remains largely unexplored due to difficulties in\naccess and avoiding contamination. To address this, we have developed SAMPLE\n(Stratospheric Altitude Microbiology Probe for Life Existence), a balloon-borne\npayload designed to collect dust samples from the stratosphere and return them\nin conditions suitable for lab analysis. The entire system is novel and\ndesigned in-house, with weight- and stress-optimized components. The main\npayload includes three pre-sterilized sampling trays and a controller that\ndetermines altitude and governs tray operation. One tray will remain closed\nduring flight (airborne control) and another on the ground (cleanroom control)\nto monitor contamination. Additional systems include environmental sensors, GPS\ntrackers, cameras, and a Flight Termination Unit (FTU) to end the mission once\nsampling is complete. A parachute ensures the safe recovery of the payload.\nUpon retrieving the payload, the sampling trays (including controls) will be\nsent to a suitable laboratory where the samples will be examined for the\npresence and nature of collected material.",

Terahertz (THz) band-enabled simultaneous wireless\ninformation and power transfer (SWIPT) systems offer ultra-high data rates and\nexpansive bandwidth. However, THz waves are inherently susceptible to severe\npath loss and beam misalignment due to their narrow-beam characteristics. In\nthis context, this paper proposes a reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface(RIS)-assisted transmitter architecture for the THz-SWIPT system, which\nenables end-to-end self-alignment for steady-state transmission. The proposed\nsystem incorporates phase conjugate circuits to achieve self-aligned\nbeamforming, facilitating the dynamic tracking of mobile IoT devices without\nthe need for beam training. Additionally, active amplification within the RIS\narrays compensates for cascaded channel attenuation through an iterative power\ncycle, thereby enhancing the energy transmission efficiency. Theoretical models\nand simulations indicate that the proposed system significantly mitigates\nsidelobe interference, achieving a transmission efficiency of up to 73.26% over\na 2 meter distance with self-alignment.",

To address those challenges, we propose NeuralMark, a\nrobust method built around a hashed watermark filter.

SN 2024abfo is the seventh SN IIb with a\ndirect progenitor detection. We find that the position of the supernova in our\nERIS adaptive optics imaging agrees with the progenitor position in archival\nHST imaging to within 19 mas. The progenitor SED is consistent with an A5\ngiant. Single star models predict an initial mass in the range 11 to 15 solar\nmasses, while the most probable binary model is a 12+1.2 solar mass system with\nan initial period of 1.73 years. We also find significant evidence for\nvariability of the progenitor candidate in the years prior to core-collapse. SN\n2024abfo is the least luminous SN IIb with a direct progenitor detections. At\nlate times the r-band light curve decays more slowly than the comparison SNe,\nwhich may be due to increased gamma-ray trapping. Similar to SN 2008ax, SN\n2024abfo does not show a prominent double-peaked light curve. Our semi-analytic\nlight curve modelling shows that this may be due to a very low mass of hydrogen\nin the outer envelope. Spectrally, SN 2024abfo is most similar to SN 2008ax at\nearly times while at later times (80 days) it appears to show persistent Halpha\nabsorption compared to the comparison sample. We prefer a binary system to\nexplain the supernova and its progenitor, although we are unable to rule out\nsingle-star models. We recommend late-time observations to search for a binary\ncompanion and signatures of CSM-interaction. The absence of these features\nwould support the hypothesis that SN 2024abfo resulted from a system which\nunderwent a period of binary mass transfer well before (1000 yr) the explosion,\nresulting in a low-mass hydrogen-rich envelope.",

In particular, models based on\na recursive, autoregressive-type structure such as the well-known\ninteger-valued autoregressive (INAR) models are very popular in practice. The\ndistribution of such INAR models is fully determined by a vector of\nautoregressive binomial thinning coefficients and the discrete innovation\ndistribution. While fully parametric estimation techniques for these models are\nmostly covered in the literature, a semi-parametric approach allows for\nconsistent and efficient joint estimation of the model coefficients and the\ninnovation distribution without imposing any parametric assumptions. Although\nthe limiting distribution of this estimator is known, which, in principle,\nenables asymptotic inference and INAR model diagnostics on the innovations, it\nis cumbersome to apply in practice.\n  In this paper, we consider a corresponding semi-parametric INAR bootstrap\nprocedure and show its joint consistency for the estimation of the INAR\ncoefficients and for the estimation of the innovation distribution. We discuss\ndifferent application scenarios that include goodness-of-fit testing,\npredictive inference and joint dispersion index analysis for count time series.\nIn simulations, we illustrate the finite sample performance of the\nsemi-parametric INAR bootstrap using several innovation distributions and\nprovide real-data applications.",

Their inherent\nambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes\nthem a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of\ntargeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under\nclothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which\nis the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly\ndefine, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL\ncomprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation\n(DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent\nsamples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives\nfor effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2)\nHard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware\noptimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic\nlabels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives\ncloser in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability\nand robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the\npotential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust\nCC-ReID.

In this work, we\nsystematically analyzed the Swift/XRT data of long GRBs with plateau emission\nthat were detected before 2023 December, and estimated the physical parameters\nby considering the $R/I$ evolutionary effects. We found that neglecting the\n$R/I$ evolutionary effects can lead to systematic overestimation or\nunderestimation of magnetar parameters such as $B_p$, $P_0$, and $\\epsilon$\nfrom 20\\% to 50\\%. We also found that some tight correlations, which can be\napproximately expressed as $\\epsilon\\propto P_0^{1.57\\pm0.22}$,\n$\\epsilon\\propto B_p^{0.97\\pm0.13}$, $B_p\\propto P_0^{1.30\\pm0.16}$, $E_{\\rm\nwind}\\propto E_{\\rm jet,iso}^{0.83\\pm0.07}(E_{\\rm jet}^{0.76\\pm0.06})$,\n$P_0\\propto E_{\\rm jet,iso}^{-0.29\\pm0.03}(E_{\\rm jet}^{-0.26\\pm0.02})$,\n$B_p\\propto E_{\\rm jet,iso}^{-0.58\\pm0.06}(E_{\\rm jet}^{-0.55\\pm0.05})$, and\n$\\epsilon\\propto E_{\\rm jet,iso}^{-0.55\\pm0.07}(E_{\\rm jet}^{-0.52\\pm0.06})$\nfor our selected EoSs. The universal correlations suggest that a nascent\nmagnetar with the faster $P_0$, lower $B_p$, and lower $\\epsilon$ are more\ninclined to power a more energetic GRB jet, and the $\\epsilon$ and $P_0$ of\nnewborn magnetar are likely to originate from the magnetically induced\ndistortion and correspond to the equilibrium spin period as a result of\ninteraction between the magnetar and its accretion disk, respectively. Finally,\nwe found that the GW signals from the remnants of those GW-dominated GRBs with\nredshift measurements cannot reach aLIGO sensitivity threshold, and only two\ncases (GRBs 150323A and 170607A) can reach ET sensitivity threshold.

Among various candidates,\nself-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) remain highly promising due to\ntheir ability to emit coherent and indistinguishable photons, as well as their\ncompatibility with photonic integration. In this work, we investigate the\nimpact of post-growth rapid thermal annealing (RTA) on the quantum optical\nproperties of single self-assembled QDs embedded in a p-i-n diode structure.\nThe annealing process induces a controlled blueshift of the emission wavelength\nby promoting Ga in-diffusion and intermixing. Using resonance fluorescence\nmeasurements at cryogenic temperatures (4.2 K), we investigate the\nsingle-photon statistics, the emission linewidths, and coherence time $T_2$ of\nthe emitted photons. Our results show that, despite the high annealing\ntemperature of $760^\\circ$C, the process does not degrade the optical quality\nof the quantum dots strongly. Instead, we observe single-photon emission with\nnear transform-limited linewidths, where the dephasing time $T_2$ is only a\nfactor 1.5 above the Fourier-limit $T_2=2T_1$. These findings demonstrate that\nrapid thermal annealing (RTA) serves as an effective tuning method that\npreserves the key single-photon emission properties and may help reduce\nundesirable effects such as non-radiative Auger recombination in quantum\nphotonic applications.",

To this end, we present DIJA, the first\nsystematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety\nweaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial\ninterleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of\ndLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional\nmodeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked\nspans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic\nfiltering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard\nalignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned\ndLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed\nin the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA\nsignificantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously\noverlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves\nup to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior\nbaseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and\nby 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of\nharmful content in the jailbreak prompt.

    "abstract": "Recently, several studies have indicated that data poisoning attacks pose a\nsevere security threat to deep learning-based (DL-based) code search models.\nAttackers inject carefully crafted malicious patterns into the training data,\nmisleading the code search model to learn these patterns during training.\nDuring the usage of the poisoned code search model for inference, once the\nmalicious pattern is triggered, the model tends to rank the vulnerability code\nhigher. However, existing detection methods for data poisoning attacks on\nDL-based code search models remain insufficiently effective. To address this\ncritical security issue, we propose MT4DP, a Data Poisoning Attack Detection\nFramework for DL-based Code Search Models via Metamorphic Testing. MT4DP\nintroduces a novel Semantically Equivalent Metamorphic Relation (SE-MR)\ndesigned to detect data poisoning attacks on DL-based code search models.\nSpecifically, MT4DP first identifies the high-frequency words from search\nqueries as potential poisoning targets and takes their corresponding queries as\nthe source queries. For each source query, MT4DP generates two semantically\nequivalent follow-up queries and retrieves its source ranking list. Then, each\nsource ranking list is re-ranked based on the semantic similarities between its\ncode snippets and the follow-up queries. Finally, variances between the source\nand re-ranked lists are calculated to reveal violations of the SE-MR and warn\nthe data poisoning attack. Experimental results demonstrate that MT4DP\nsignificantly enhances the detection of data poisoning attacks on DL-based code\nsearch models, outperforming the best baseline by 191% on average F1 score and\n265% on average precision. Our work aims to promote further research into\neffective techniques for mitigating data poisoning threats on DL-based code\nsearch models.",

Both ghost types exhibit a characteristic morphology and are\noffset from the originating stars. The offsets are well modelled using 2D\npolynomials, with only stars brighter than approximately 10 magnitudes in each\nfilter producing significant ghost contributions. The masking radii for these\nghosts depend on both the source-star brightness and the filter wavelength,\nranging from 20 to 40 pixels. We present the final relations and models used in\nthe near-infrared (NIR) data pipeline to mask these ghosts for Euclid's Quick\nData Release (Q1).",

As the expectations for precision,\nautomation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are\nincreasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress\nin computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect\ndetection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant\ndevelopment has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection\nframeworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and\nfacilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a\ncohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains\nelusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both\nclosed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D\nmodalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the\nrising prominence of open-set techniques.

This method follows the principles of transfer\nlearning by enabling generalization across different datasets through\nphysics-informed adaptation. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by\ntransferring a pre-trained model from a rectangular plate dataset to a violin\ntop plate dataset, where it shows improved reconstruction accuracy compared to\nthe pre-trained model and delivers performance comparable to that of\nCompressive-Equivalent Source Method (C-ESM).

    "abstract": "Understanding the 3D geometry of transparent objects from RGB images is\nchallenging due to their inherent physical properties, such as reflection and\nrefraction. To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse\nviews and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian\nSplatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key\ninsight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling\nfocused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate\nartifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions,\nensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting.\nFurthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the\nreconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and\nchain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning.\nTRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it\nconsistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based\nstate-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean\nabsolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore,\ndespite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\\delta} < 2.5 cm\naccuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.\nCode and more results are available at https://jeongyun0609.github.io/TRAN-D/.",

In binary\nsystems, tidal forces and magnetic interactions can further shape the magnetic\ngeometry. We report a longitudinal preference of star spots, chromospheric\nactivities, and flares in the active single-lined spectroscopic PMS binary\nsystem V2279 Cyg, based on long-term photometric observations from\n\\textit{Kepler} and \\textit{TESS} alongside spectroscopic data from LAMOST. The\nsystem is classified as a weak-line T Tauri binary, with component masses\nestimated at 0.86 $M_\\odot$ and 0.27 $M_\\odot$. V2279 Cyg's nearly circular\norbit is synchronized with its 4.126-day rotational period. Observations reveal\nlarge star spot regions clustered near the far-side hemisphere. Spectroscopic\ndata show strong, double-peak H$\\alpha$ emission, the strength of which is\nhighly correlated with star spot distribution, indicating the presence of an\nactive longitude on the primary star. We also mapped the prominence structure\nco-rotating with the primary star, suggesting a dense structure close to the\nnear-side hemisphere. Furthermore, we identify an inactive longitude of flares\nduring the 4-year \\textit{Kepler} observations, where the frequency of flare\nactivity is significantly reduced after the superior conjunction, marking the\nfirst such identification in active binary systems. Additionally, a white light\nsuperflare, releasing energy of $2.5 \\times 10^{37}$ erg, was detected in\n\\textit{TESS} observations. These findings provide valuable insights into the\nmagnetic field geometry and dynamo processes in PMS binaries, underscoring the\ncritical role of tidal interactions in shaping magnetic activities.",

In this paper we consider a sequence\nconsisting of two segments, that leads to an uncertainty in the determining of\nabsorption - one value of the Q parameter corresponds to two values of the\nnon-reddened color index. We propose a method to select a segment of the\nzero-reddening sequence for the main sequence stars of the cluster. The method\nis based on the difference in the position of stars of different segments in\nthe cluster luminosity function. To test the proposed method, we simulate the\nluminosity functions of clusters with the non-uniform absorption distribution\nin the cluster region. With the typical absorption values in embedded clusters,\nabout 10 % of stars are erroneously assigned, but in some cases this fraction\ncan reach 20 %. Thus, despite the fact that irregular absorption distorts the\ndistribution of stars of different segments on the cluster luminosity function,\nour method allows to separate stars with an error of no more than 20 %.",

    "abstract": "Reducing feedback overhead in beyond 5G networks is a critical challenge, as\nthe growing number of antennas in modern massive MIMO systems substantially\nincreases the channel state information (CSI) feedback demand in frequency\ndivision duplex (FDD) systems. To address this, extensive research has focused\non CSI compression and prediction, with neural network-based approaches gaining\nmomentum and being considered for integration into the 3GPP 5G-Advanced\nstandards. While deep learning has been effectively applied to CSI-limited\nbeamforming and handover optimization, reference signal allocation under such\nconstraints remains surprisingly underexplored.

    "abstract": "Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is a powerful tool for addressing a\nwide range of real-world problems, but it lacks a clear structure for comparing\ninstances. A reliable similarity metric could establish meaningful\nrelationships between instances, enabling more effective evaluation of instance\nset heterogeneity and providing better guidance to solvers, particularly when\nmachine learning is involved. Existing similarity metrics often lack precision\nin identifying instance classes or rely heavily on labeled data, which limits\ntheir applicability and generalization. To bridge this gap, this paper\nintroduces the first mathematical distance metric for MILP instances, derived\ndirectly from their mathematical formulations. By discretizing right-hand\nsides, weights, and variables into classes, the proposed metric draws\ninspiration from the Earth mover's distance to quantify mismatches in\nweight-variable distributions for constraint comparisons. This approach\nnaturally extends to enable instance-level comparisons. We evaluate both an\nexact and a greedy variant of our metric under various parameter settings,\nusing the StrIPLIB dataset. Results show that all components of the metric\ncontribute to class identification, and that the greedy version achieves\naccuracy nearly identical to the exact formulation while being nearly 200 times\nfaster.

However,\nachieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian\nSplatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently\nambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these\nlimitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that\nenables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a\nrobust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction\n(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model\nview-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and\nconsistent part segmentations across viewpoints.

In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled\nLatent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality\npart-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region\nwhile preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as\nGaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond\nthe existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local\n3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects\nqualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and\nflexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS)\nfingerprinting is a widely used indoor localization approach due to its\ncompatibility with mobile embedded devices. Deep Learning (DL) models improve\naccuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but\nthey assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to\nincorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of\nreal-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous\nmobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS\nreadings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models\nby encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal\nrelationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise\ndistributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded\naccuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these\nchallenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive\ngraph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor\nstate-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to\nmitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity. GATE introduces\n1) a novel Attention Hyperspace Vector (AHV) for enhanced message passing, 2) a\nnovel Multi-Dimensional Hyperspace Vector (MDHV) to mitigate the GNN blind\nspot, and 3) an new Real-Time Edge Construction (RTEC) approach for dynamic\ngraph adaptation.

However,\nas computing demands continue to increase in size and speed, these wired\ninterconnects can become longer and less effective. One possible solution is to\nenhance the wired interconnects with short-range wireless communication (SRWC),\nwhich offers flexible resource allocation and the ability to broadcast data.\nHowever, implementing SRWC inside a computer chassis presents challenges due to\nmultiple scattering. This scattering stretches the channel impulse response\n(CIR), leading to inter-symbol interference (ISI) and limiting data rates. To\naddress this issue, we propose transforming the computer chassis into a smart\nradio environment by utilizing a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The\nRIS elements adjust the phase of reflected waves so that the multipath\ncomponents combine at the receiver in a way that creates a pulse-like CIR. This\napproach has been experimentally validated within a typical computer chassis.\nThe results of this study pave the way for integrating RIS-enabled SRWC to\nenhance wireless links in both current and future data processing units.",

    "abstract": "The kinematics analysis of foot-ankle complex during gait is essential for\nadvancing biomechanical research and clinical assessment. Collecting accurate\nsurface geometry data from the foot and ankle during dynamic gait conditions is\ninherently challenging due to swing foot occlusions and viewing limitations.\nThus, this paper introduces FootGait3D, a novel multi-view dataset of\nhigh-resolution ankle-foot surface point clouds captured during natural gait.\nDifferent from existing gait datasets that typically target whole-body or\nlower-limb motion, FootGait3D focuses specifically on the detailed modeling of\nthe ankle-foot region, offering a finer granularity of motion data. To address\nthis, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46\nsubjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a\ncomplete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth)\nalong with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views.\nThis structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud\ncompletion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints. Our dataset\nis designed for shape completion tasks, facilitating the benchmarking of\nstate-of-the-art single-modal (e.g., PointTr, SnowflakeNet, Anchorformer) and\nmulti-modal (e.g., SVDFormer, PointSea, CSDN) completion networks on the\nchallenge of recovering the full foot geometry from occluded inputs. FootGait3D\nhas significant potential to advance research in biomechanics and multi-segment\nfoot modeling, offering a valuable testbed for clinical gait analysis,\nprosthetic design, and robotics applications requiring detailed 3D models of\nthe foot during motion.

Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features\nto capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and\noften inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce\nfrequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches\nlimits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the\nDark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel\ndual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment\nacross spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two\nkey modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a\npixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance\nhaze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware\nspectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which\nfuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid\ngating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior\nCorrection Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback\nmechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed\nfeatures and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in\nchallenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze\ndatasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with\nsuperior robustness and real-time efficiency.

To investigate these mechanisms, we developed the Rosetta\nStone project: an end-to-end (simulations-observations) framework that is based\non the systematic production of realistic synthetic observations of clump\nfragmentation and their comparison with real data. In this work, we compare\nALMA 1.3mm continuum dust emission observations from the SQUALO survey with a\nnew set of 24 radiative magnetohydrodynamical simulations of high-mass clump\nfragmentation, post-processed using the CASA software to mimic the observing\nstrategy of SQUALO. The simulations were initialized combining typical values\nof clump mass (500,1000 solar masses) and radius (~0.4pc) with two levels of\nturbulence (Mach number of 7,10) and three levels of magnetization\n(mass-to-flux ratio of ~3,10,100). Following the clump evolution over time with\ntwo random seeds projected along three orthogonal directions, we produced a\ncollection of 732 synthetic fields. The synthetic observations of clump\nfragmentation at ~7000AU revealed between 2 and 14 fragments per field. Among\nthe initial conditions of the simulations, magnetic fields have the largest\nimpact on the fragment multiplicity at these scales. In advanced stages of\nclump evolution, a lower number of fragments is preferentially associated with\nmagnetized clumps. Fragments identified at ~7000AU correspond to individual or\nmultiple sink particles in ~75% of the cases, suggesting that not all fragments\nare actively forming stars. Both sinks and fragments accrete mass throughout\nthe whole clump evolution, favoring a scenario in which fragments are not\nisolated from the environment. Our study demonstrates the importance of\nsynthetic observations in interpreting results from interferometric\nobservations.",

In\nparticular, we identify $D_{sJ}(2700)$ as the $2^3S_1$, $D_{s0}(2590)$ as the\n$2^1S_0$, $D_{sJ}(2860)$ as the $1^3D_3$, $D_{s1}(2860)$ as the $1^3D_1$, and\n$D_{sJ}(3040)$ as the $2^1P_1$ states. The effective coupling constants $g_T$,\n$g_X$, $g_Y$, $\\tilde{g}_S$ and $\\tilde{g}_H$ extracted from present analysis.\nFurthermore, the $D^*K$ decay channel emerges as the most promising mode for\nthe experimental search of the missing $1^3D_2$ and $1^1D_2$ states, while the\n$2^3P_0$ state is more likely to be observed through the $DK$ channel.",

On the other hand, pathwise policy\ngradients alleviate the training variance, but are reliable only when driven by\nan accurate action-conditioned value function which is notoriously hard to\ntrain without relying on past off-policy data. In this paper, we discuss how to\nconstruct a value-gradient driven, on-policy algorithm that allow training\nQ-value models purely from on-policy data, unlocking the possibility of using\npathwise policy updates in the context of on-policy learning. We show how to\nbalance stochastic policies for exploration with constrained policy updates for\nstable training, and evaluate important architectural components that\nfacilitate accurate value function learning. Building on these insights, we\npropose Relative Entropy Pathwise Policy Optimization (REPPO), an efficient\non-policy algorithm that combines the sample-efficiency of pathwise policy\ngradients with the simplicity and minimal memory footprint of standard\non-policy learning.

    "abstract": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing\nlarge language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and\ncomputational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods\noften rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,\nunder the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained\nfull-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation\nprocess introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights\nand their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally\nflawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly\nincorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error\ncompensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference\nbetween latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited\ngeneralization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach\nintroduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages\nprecomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian\nsubmatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models\nand benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical\nGPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of\nLlama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from\n51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.\nFurthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as\nGPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging\nW4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision\nbaselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve.

However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a\nsimplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural\nrepresentations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin\nto those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information\nredundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive\nperformance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight\narchitectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information\nprocessing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled\nby kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order\nspatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further\nmodulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise\nredundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently\ngather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental\nresults in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable\nparameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,\non the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M\nparameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver\nstrong performance through an efficient design.

Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual\nsimilarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it\ndifficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional\ngradient-based methods prioritise $\\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing\nadversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making\nthem detectable. We propose a latent space perturbation framework using a\nmixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate imperceptible adversarial\nexamples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical\nfeatures into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve\nstatistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to\nmeasure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically\nindistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly\navailable datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method\nachieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance\ncompared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted\nfrom image domain approaches. Our comprehensive analysis includes\nhyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control mechanisms, and generative\narchitectural comparisons, revealing that VAE-based attacks depend critically\non reconstruction quality but offer superior practical utility when sufficient\ntraining data is available.

This methodology holds significant promise\nin selecting prospective treatments based on their indirect effect for further\nevaluation in randomized clinical trials.\n  We apply this methodology to assess which of two measures of HIV persistence\nis a more promising target for future HIV curative treatments.

Their\nperformance in variable selection and especially statistical inference in the\npresence of heavy-tailed model errors is not well understood. In this paper, we\naddress the question by developing robust Bayesian hierarchical models\nutilizing the horseshoe family of priors along with an efficient Gibbs sampling\nscheme. We show that compared with competing methods with alternative sampling\nstrategies such as slice sampling, our proposals lead to superior performance\nin variable selection, Bayesian estimation and statistical inference. In\nparticular, our numeric studies indicate that even without imposing exact\nsparsity, the one-group horseshoe priors can still yield valid Bayesian\ncredible intervals under robust high-dimensional linear regression models.\nApplications of the proposed and alternative methods on real data further\nillustrates the advantage of the proposed methods.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a Eulerian theory to elucidate the molecular kinematics\nin polymer networks and their connection to continuum deformation, grounded in\nfundamental statistical physics and thermodynamics. Three key innovations are\nincorporated: 1. The network behavior is described through a global\nthermodynamic equilibrium condition that maximizes the number of accessible\nmicrostates for all segments, instead of directly dealing with the\nwell-established single-chain models commonly adopted in traditional\napproaches. A variational problem is then posed in the Eulerian framework to\nidentify this equilibrium state under geometric fluctuation constraints. Its\nsolution recaptures the classical single-chain model and reveals the dependence\nof chain kinematics upon continuum deformation. 2. The chain stretch and\norientation probability are found to be explicitly specified through the\nEulerian logarithmic strain and spatial direction. The resulting hyperelastic\nmodel, with only two physical parameters, outperforms the extant models with\nsame number of parameters. It further provides a physical justification for\nprior models exhibiting superior predictive capabilities: the model becomes\nequivalent to the Biot-chain model at moderate deformations, while converging\nto the classical Hencky strain energy in the small strain limit. 3.A novel\nbiaxial instability emerges as a phase transition in chain orientation. At\nsufficiently large deformation, chains increasingly align with the primary\nstretched direction, depleting their density in other directions. Consequently,\nthe stresses in non-primary stretched directions would decrease as the loss in\nchain density outweighs the gain in chain force. For equal biaxial tension,\ninstability is therefore triggered because perfect equality of the two\nprincipal stretches without any perturbation is practically unachievable.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for learning vision-based robotic policies\nfor contact-rich manipulation tasks that generalize spatially across task\nconfigurations. We focus on achieving robust spatial generalization of the\npolicy for the peg-in-hole (PiH) task trained from a small number of\ndemonstrations. We propose EquiContact, a hierarchical policy composed of a\nhigh-level vision planner (Diffusion Equivariant Descriptor Field, Diff-EDF)\nand a novel low-level compliant visuomotor policy (Geometric Compliant ACT,\nG-CompACT). G-CompACT operates using only localized observations (geometrically\nconsistent error vectors (GCEV), force-torque readings, and wrist-mounted RGB\nimages) and produces actions defined in the end-effector frame. Through these\ndesign choices, we show that the entire EquiContact pipeline is\nSE(3)-equivariant, from perception to force control. We also outline three key\ncomponents for spatially generalizable contact-rich policies: compliance,\nlocalized policies, and induced equivariance. Real-world experiments on PiH\ntasks demonstrate a near-perfect success rate and robust generalization to\nunseen spatial configurations, validating the proposed framework and\nprinciples.

    "abstract": "Prior human-robot interaction (HRI) research has primarily focused on\nsingle-user interactions, where robots do not need to consider the timing or\nrecipient of their responses. However, in multi-party interactions, such as at\nmalls and hospitals, social robots must understand the context and decide both\nwhen and to whom they should respond. In this paper, we propose a\nTransformer-based multi-task learning framework to improve the decision-making\nprocess of social robots, particularly in multi-user environments. Considering\nthe characteristics of HRI, we propose two novel loss functions: one that\nenforces constraints on active speakers to improve scene modeling, and another\nthat guides response selection towards utterances specifically directed at the\nrobot. Additionally, we construct a novel multi-party HRI dataset that captures\nreal-world complexities, such as gaze misalignment. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in respond\ndecisions, outperforming existing heuristic-based and single-task approaches.\nOur findings contribute to the development of socially intelligent social\nrobots capable of engaging in natural and context-aware multi-party\ninteractions.",

Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle -\nand very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have\nbeen given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference\nof the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to\ncircular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of\nthem involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a\ntime-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy\nvalues of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on\nwhich we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our\nuniverse's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced\nas an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the\nstandard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its \"1000CE\" variant, the past hypothesis,\nthe second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully\nformal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's\nstipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all\nmake an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single\nmoment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In\nthis aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally\nlegitimate (or not).",

Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the\ncurrent study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a\nfine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human\nperformance. First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in\nLLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity\nbetween the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity\nbetween the source and distractor texts. Second, it investigated the\neffectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. Throughout, we\nexamine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in\nhumans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and\nnot just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done). Our\nexperiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters)\nand performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as\nGPT-4 and LLaMA3.

Traditional deep learning approaches, such as\nCasanovo, mainly utilize autoregressive decoders and predict amino acids\nsequentially.

To address these issues, this\npaper investigates using diffusion decoders adapted for the discrete data\ndomain. These decoders provide a different approach, allowing sequence\ngeneration to start from any peptide segment, thereby enhancing prediction\naccuracy. We experiment with three different diffusion decoder designs,\nknapsack beam search, and various loss functions. We find knapsack beam search\ndid not improve performance metrics and simply replacing the transformer\ndecoder with a diffusion decoder lowered performance. Although peptide\nprecision and recall were still 0, the best diffusion decoder design with the\nDINOISER loss function obtained a statistically significant improvement in\namino acid recall by 0.373 compared to the baseline autoregressive\ndecoder-based Casanovo model.

As discussed by Newman et\nal., whose results we revise using the complete LATIS survey data, these are\ncandidate ultraviolet (UV)-dim protoclusters that may harbor distinct galaxy\npopulations missed by rest-UV spectroscopic surveys. We present follow-up\nobservations targeting one such candidate embedded within Antu, an extended\nregion of IGM absorption at $z=2.685$ that contains five IGM-selected\nprotoclusters and has a total mass of $3 \\times 10^{15}~M_{\\odot}$. Ly$\\alpha$\nemitters trace the overall structure of Antu but avoid the center of the\ncandidate UV-dim protocluster, which also appears to contain no\nsubmillimeter-selected sources. A near-infrared spectroscopic galaxy census is\nneeded to determine whether this large region is dominated by galaxies with\nreduced or absent star-formation activity. This work adds to a growing and\npuzzling literature on discrepancies among different galaxy and IGM tracers,\nwhose resolution promises to shed light on the early stages of\nenvironment-dependent galaxy evolution.",

A key advantage of Ly$\\alpha$ tomography is that it enables the\ndiscovery of overdense regions without the need to detect their galaxy members\nin spectroscopic surveys, circumventing possible selection biases. We use these\nmaps to identify 37 IGM-selected overdensities as regions of strong and\nspatially coherent Ly$\\alpha$ absorption. Simulations indicate that 85% of\nthese are protoclusters, defined as the progenitors of $z=0$ halos with mass\n$M_{\\rm desc} > 10^{14} M_{\\odot}$, and that nearly all of the rest are\nprotogroups ($10^{13.5} < M_{\\rm desc} / M_{\\odot} < 10^{14}$). We estimate the\nmasses and space densities of the IGM-selected overdensities and show they are\nin accordance with mock surveys. We investigate the LATIS counterparts of some\npreviously reported protoclusters, including the proto-supercluster Hyperion.\nWe identify a new component of Hyperion beyond its previously known extent. We\nshow that the Ly$\\alpha$ transmission of the galaxy density peaks within\nHyperion is consistent with a simple physical model (the fluctuating\nGunn-Peterson approximation), suggesting that active galactic nucleus feedback\nor other processes have not affected the large-scale gas ionization within this\nstructure as whole.

This study introduces a fast and accurate conditional variational\ninference (CVI) approach to calibrate MNP model parameters, which is scalable\nto large samples and large choice sets. A flexible variational distribution on\ncorrelated latent utilities is defined using neural embeddings, and a\nreparameterization trick is used to ensure the positive definiteness of the\nresulting covariance matrix. The resulting CVI estimator is similar to a\nvariational autoencoder, with the variational model being the encoder and the\nMNP's data generating process being the decoder.

This eliminates the need to\nsample from high dimensional truncated Gaussian distributions, significantly\nreducing computational costs as the number of alternatives grows.

    "abstract": "Cross-view localization, the task of estimating a camera's\n3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DoF) pose by aligning ground-level images with\nsatellite images, is crucial for large-scale outdoor applications like\nautonomous navigation and augmented reality. Existing methods often rely on\nfully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.\nIn this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self\ndistillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View\n(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view\nlocalization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,\nwhile the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart\ncreated by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those\nof the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores\ntextureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions\nand reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas\nor limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly\nimproves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative\norientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth. GeoDistill\nprovides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view\nlocalization challenges. Code and model can be found at\nhttps://github.com/tongshw/GeoDistill.",

    "abstract": "(Abridged) Stroke and SCI are conditions that can significantly impact the\nQoL of survivors in both the physical and psychosocial domains. Both diseases\noften result in significant motor and sensory impairments that are not fully\nreversible despite current available therapies. Invasive BCIs have emerged as a\npromising means to bypass the site of injury and potentially restore motor and\nsensory function. However, to maximize the utility and participant satisfaction\nwith such technology, participants' willingness to embrace BCIs must be\nassessed, and placed in context with functional goals and rehabilitative\npriorities. Hence, we conducted a survey of a cohort of stroke (n=33), SCI\n(n=37), and both (n=1) participants regarding their receptiveness to invasive\nECoG-based BCIs as well as to assess their goals for functional rehabilitation.\nOverall, participants indicated a high level of willingness to undergo surgery\nto implant ECoG grids for BCI technology if basic motor functions, including\nupper extremity, gait, bowel/bladder, and sensory function were restored. There\nwas no correlation between participant willingness to undergo a prospective BCI\nimplantation and the level of functional recovery offered by the BCI.\nSimilarly, there was no correlation between willingness to undergo surgery and\nthe participants' perceived rehabilitative priorities and level of disability.\nThese findings indicate that participants were interested in invasive BCI\ntechnology even if only basic functions can be restored, regardless of their\nlevel of disability and their rehabilitative priorities. Such observations\nimply that first generation commercial invasive BCIs may not need extensive\nfunctions to garner adoption. Conversely, it also raises a concern that\nparticipants from the stroke and SCI cohort may be overly enthusiastic about\nsuch technology, which poses potential risks for medical exploitation.",

    "abstract": "Data quality remains an important challenge in data-driven systems, as errors\nin tabular data can severely compromise downstream analytics and machine\nlearning performance. Although numerous error detection algorithms have been\nproposed, the lack of diverse, real-world error datasets limits comprehensive\nevaluation. Manual error annotation is both time-consuming and inconsistent,\nmotivating the exploration of synthetic error generation as an alternative. In\nthis work, we introduce TableEG, a framework that leverages large language\nmodels (LLMs) to generate authentic errors. By employing a table fine-tuning\nstrategy and a triplet representation $(I, T, O)$ to model error generation,\ndetection, and correction tasks, TableEG captures the complex dependencies\ninherent in two-dimensional tables. Trained on 12 real-world datasets spanning\n10 diverse domains, TableEG ensures that the synthesized errors faithfully\nreflect authentic error distributions. Experimental results indicate that\nerrors generated by TableEG exhibit superior pattern and distribution\nsimilarity compared to both rule-based methods and LLM-generated errors without\nfine-tuning. Furthermore, performance metrics on TableEG-generated errors\nclosely align with those on real-world errors across nearly all datasets and\ndetection algorithms, particularly for machine learning based detection\ntechniques. Overall, TableEG not only bridges the gap between synthetic and\nreal-world errors but also establishes a robust benchmark for subsequent error\ndetection and correction tasks.",

This\nbehavior reveals an optimal range of twist angles and frequencies for achieving\nhigh-quality MFCs with a large number of comb teeth. Our findings deepen the\nunderstanding of nonlinear interactions in twisted MCs and highlight their\npotential for advancing moir\\'e-based materials in information processing and\nhigh-precision metrology.",

One\nsignature of AGN activity is luminosity variability, which appears in the\nmid-infrared (mid-IR) when circumnuclear dust reprocesses UV and optical\nphotons from the AGN accretion disk. We present here a suite of constraints on\nthe fraction of AGN activity in the most underdense regions of the universe\n(cosmic voids) relative to the rest of the universe (cosmic walls) by using ~12\nyears of combined multi-epoch data from AllWISE and NEOWISE to quantify mid-IR\nvariability. We find clear evidence for a larger mid-IR variability-AGN\nfraction among high and moderate-luminosity void galaxies compared to their\nwall counterparts. We also show that mid-IR variability identifies a rather\nlarge and unique population of AGNs, the majority of which have eluded\ndetection using more traditional AGN-selection methods such as single-epoch\nmid-IR color selection. The fraction of these newly-recovered AGNs is larger\namong galaxies in voids, suggesting once again more prolific AGN activity in\nthe most underdense large scale structures of the universe.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often show poor performance in low-resource\nlanguages like Korean, partly due to unique linguistic challenges such as\nhomophonous Sino-Korean words that are indistinguishable in Hangul script. To\naddress this semantic ambiguity, we propose HanjaBridge, a novel\nmeaning-injection technique integrated into a continual pre-training (CPT)\nframework. Instead of deterministically mapping a word to a single Hanja\n(Chinese character), HanjaBridge presents the model with all possible Hanja\ncandidates for a given homograph, encouraging the model to learn contextual\ndisambiguation. This process is paired with token-level knowledge distillation\nto prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that HanjaBridge\nsignificantly improves Korean language understanding, achieving a 21\\% relative\nimprovement on the KoBALT benchmark. Notably, by reinforcing semantic alignment\nbetween Korean and Chinese through shared Hanja, we observe a strong positive\ncross-lingual transfer.

    "abstract": "Recently, much effort has been devoted to modeling users' multi-interests\nbased on their behaviors or auxiliary signals. However, existing methods often\nrely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same\ninterest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with\nreal-world scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) show significant\npotential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and\npowerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain. First, the\ngranularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to\noverly fine or coarse interest grouping. Second, individual user analysis\nprovides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we\npropose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more\neffective recommendation. At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to\nflexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters,\nindicating their diverse and distinct interests. To alleviate the agnostic\ngeneration of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users'\ncollaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions,\nallowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's\nbehaviors using an alignment module. To alleviate the limited insights derived\nfrom individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose\naggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more\ncomprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis. We formulate a max covering\nproblem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users'\nbehaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven\nmulti-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests.\nExperiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of our approach against\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

They are\ncharacterized by two independent topological charges, \\textit{viz}., vorticity\n$S$ and winding number $M$ of the intrinsic twist, whose product determines the\n\\textit{Hopf number}, $Q_{H}=MS$, which is the basic characteristic of the\nhopfions. We construct hopfions as solutions of the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii\nequations (GPEs) for Bose-Einstein condensates in binary atomic gases. The GPE\nsystem includes the cubic mean-field self-attraction, competing with the\nquartic self-repulsive Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) term, which represents effects of\nquantum fluctuations around the mean-field state, and a trapping toroidal\npotential (TP). A systematic numerical analysis demonstrates that families of\nthe states with $S=1,M=0$, i.e., $Q_{H}=0$, are stable, provided that the inner\nTP\\ radius $R_{0}$ exceeds a critical value. Furthermore, true hopfions with\n$S=1,M=1\\sim 7$, which correspond, accordingly, to $Q_{H}=1\\sim 7$, also form\npartly stable families, including the case of the LHY\\ superfluid, in which the\nnonlinearity is represented solely by the LHY term. On the other hand, the\nhopfion family is completely unstable in the absence of the LHY term, when only\nthe mean-field nonlinearity is present. We illustrate the knot-like structure\nof the hopfions by means of an elementary geometric picture. For $Q_{H}=0$,\ncircles which represent the \\textit{preimage} of the full state do not\nintersect. On the contrary, for $Q_{H}\\geq 1$ they intersect at points whose\nnumber is identical to $Q_{H}$. The intersecting curves form multi-petal\nstructures with the number of petals also equal to $Q_{H}$.",

    "abstract": "Commit messages are essential in software development as they serve to\ndocument and explain code changes. Yet, their quality often falls short in\npractice, with studies showing significant proportions of empty or inadequate\nmessages. While automated commit message generation has advanced significantly,\nparticularly with Large Language Models (LLMs), the evaluation of generated\nmessages remains challenging. Traditional reference-based automatic metrics\nlike BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR have notable limitations in assessing commit\nmessage quality, as they assume a one-to-one mapping between code changes and\ncommit messages, leading researchers to rely on resource-intensive human\nevaluation. This study investigates the potential of LLMs as automated\nevaluators for commit message quality. Through systematic experimentation with\nvarious prompt strategies and state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate that LLMs\ncombining Chain-of-Thought reasoning with few-shot demonstrations achieve near\nhuman-level evaluation proficiency. Our LLM-based evaluator significantly\noutperforms traditional metrics while maintaining acceptable reproducibility,\nrobustness, and fairness levels despite some inherent variability. This work\nconducts a comprehensive preliminary study on using LLMs for commit message\nevaluation, offering a scalable alternative to human assessment while\nmaintaining high-quality evaluation.",

Under fuel-rich conditions with relatively low heat\nrelease rates and low flow rates, the flames exhibited quasi-periodic\nsingle-mode oscillations. These oscillations were modulated by low-frequency\nflame flickering instabilities at elevated flow rates, which created sidebands\naround the primary oscillation frequency. At higher heat release rates, the\nflickering instability further triggered mode splitting, eventually leading to\nmulti-mode oscillations.

We then analyse sixty-three\nthousand eight hundred forty-six gait cycles from the OU-ISIR Large-Population\ndataset to quantify correlations between age and five key metrics: stride\nlength, walking speed, step cadence, step-time variability and joint-angle\nentropy, with correlation coefficients of at least 0.27.

In this\nwork, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such as network\nintrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often clusters by\nclass. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and introduce the\nClass Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a quantitative measure.

    "abstract": "Objective: To develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for\npredicting length of stay (LOS) in elective spine surgery, with a focus on the\nbenefits of temporal modeling and model interpretability. Materials and\nMethods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random\nforest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model,\nSurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an\nattention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data.\nPerformance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key\npredictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved\nthe highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85)\nand baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by\ndynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative\nclinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most\ncontributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone\ndisorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most\nimpactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention\nmechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential\nnature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher\naccuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical\nadoption. These results highlight the potential of integrating attention-based\ntemporal models into hospital planning workflows. Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM\npresents an effective and interpretable AI solution for LOS prediction in\nelective spine surgery. Our findings support the integration of temporal,\nexplainable ML approaches into clinical decision support systems to enhance\ndischarge readiness and individualized patient care.",

In this study, we introduce a modernized CNN-based model for\nglobal weather forecasting that delivers competitive accuracy while\nsignificantly reducing computational requirements. To present a systematic\nmodernization roadmap, we highlight key architectural enhancements across\nmultiple design scales from an earlier CNN-based approach. KAI-a incorporates a\nscale-invariant architecture and InceptionNeXt-based blocks within a\ngeophysically-aware design, tailored to the structure of Earth system data.\nTrained on the ERA5 daily dataset with 67 atmospheric variables, the model\ncontains about 7 million parameters and completes training in just 12 hours on\na single NVIDIA L40s GPU. Our evaluation shows that KAI-a matches the\nperformance of state-of-the-art models in medium-range weather forecasting,\nwhile offering a significantly lightweight design.

We interpret this as a large-$N$ effect,\narising from the enhanced non-locality of fermionic operators in SYK and binary\nSYK, absent in spin operators of the spin-SYK model. Numerically, we find that\nthese differences emerge gradually with increasing $N$. Although all variants\nare quantum chaotic, their entanglement dynamics reflect varying degrees of\nchaos and indicate that the entanglement production rate serves as a\nfine-grained probe of chaos beyond conventional measures. To probe its effect\non thermalization properties of these models, we study the two-point\nautocorrelation function, finding no differences between the SYK variants, but\ndeviations from RMT predictions for $N \\geq 24$, particularly near the\ncrossover from exponential decay to saturation regime.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of forecasting the number of units fulfilled (or\n``drained'') from each inventory warehouse to meet customer demand, along with\nthe associated outbound shipping costs. The actual drain and shipping costs are\ndetermined by complex production systems that manage the planning and execution\nof customers' orders fulfillment, i.e. from where and how to ship a unit to be\ndelivered to a customer. Accurately modeling these processes is critical for\nregional inventory planning, especially when using Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nto develop control policies. For the RL usecase, a drain model is incorporated\ninto a simulator to produce long rollouts, which we desire to be\ndifferentiable. While simulating the calls to the internal software systems can\nbe used to recover this transition, they are non-differentiable and too slow\nand costly to run within an RL training environment. Accordingly, we frame this\nas a probabilistic forecasting problem, modeling the joint distribution of\noutbound drain and shipping costs across all warehouses at each time period,\nconditioned on inventory positions and exogenous customer demand. To ensure\nrobustness in an RL environment, the model must handle out-of-distribution\nscenarios that arise from off-policy trajectories.

    "abstract": "A computational tool, Omnisoot, was developed utilizing the chemical kinetics\ncapabilities of Cantera to model the formation of carbonaceous nanoparticles,\nsuch as soot and Carbon Black (CB), from the reactions of gaseous hydrocarbons.\nOmnisoot integrates constant volume, constant pressure, perfectly stirred, and\nplug flow reactor models with four inception models from the literature, as\nwell as two population balance models: a monodisperse model and a sectional\nmodel. This package serves as an integrated process design tool to predict soot\nmass, morphology, and composition under varying process conditions. The\nmodeling approach accounts for soot inception, surface growth, and oxidation,\ncoupled with detailed gas-phase chemistry, to close the mass and energy\nbalances of the gas-particle system; subsequently, soot and gas-phase chemistry\nare linked to the particle dynamics models that consider the evolving\nfractal-like structure of soot agglomerates. The developed tool was employed to\nhighlight the similarities and differences among the implemented inception\nmodels in predicting soot mass, morphology, and size distribution for three\nuse-cases: methane pyrolysis in a shock tube, ethylene pyrolysis in a flow\nreactor, and ethylene combustion in a perfectly stirred reactor. The\nsimulations of 5% $\\mathrm{CH_4}$ pyrolysis in shock-tube with short residence\ntimes ($\\approx1.5$ ms) demonstrated that multiple combinations of inception\nand surface growth rates minimized the prediction error for carbon yield but\nled to markedly different morphologies, emphasizing the need for measured data\non soot morphology to constrain inception and surface growth rates. The\ncomparison of simulation results in a pyrolysis flow reactor at three different\nflow rates suggested that only irreversible models can predict bimodality in\nparticle size distribution.",

Traditional\napproaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent\nproperties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state\nparabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for\ncomputational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a\nGraph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is\nspecifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in\nneural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent\nrepresentations of the network's geometry, velocity fields, and concentration\nprofiles. These latent space representations are then assembled into a global\ngraph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent\nspace via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the\nNeural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration\nof an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models\nwith reduced training data requirements. Furthermore, the Neural ODE component\neffectively mitigates the issue of error accumulation commonly encountered in\nrecurrent neural networks. The effectiveness of the GALDS model is demonstrated\nthrough results on eight unseen geometries and four abnormal transport\nexamples, where our approach achieves mean relative error of 3% with maximum\nrelative error <8% and demonstrates a 10-fold speed improvement compared to\nprevious surrogate model approaches.",

Breast MRI registration is particularly\ndifficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation\ncaused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal\nstructure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial.\nWhether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level\nof complexity remains an open question.

We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM,\nMedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that\ncapture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and\npatient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that\nfoundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional\nregistration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large\ndomain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular\ntissue.

    "abstract": "Automation in optical microscopy is critical for enabling high-throughput\nimaging across a wide range of biomedical applications. Among the essential\ncomponents of automated systems, robust autofocusing plays a pivotal role in\nmaintaining image quality for both single-plane and volumetric imaging.\nHowever, conventional autofocusing methods often struggle with implementation\ncomplexity, limited generalizability across sample types, incompatibility with\nthick specimens, and slow feedback. We recently discovered a phenomenon that\nthe digitally summed Fourier spectrum of two images acquired from two-angle\nillumination exhibits interference-like fringe modulation when the sample is\ndefocused. These digital fringes correlate directly with defocus through a\nphysics-based relation. Based on this principle, we developed an automatic,\nefficient, and generalizable defocus detection method termed digital defocus\naberration interference (DAbI). Implemented with a simple two-LED setup, DAbI\ncan quantify the defocus distance over a range of 212 times the depth-of-field\n(DoF) for thin samples and 300 times for thick specimens. It can additionally\nextend the natural DoF of the imaging system by 20 folds when integrated with\ncomplex-field imaging. We demonstrated the versatile applications of DAbI on\nbrightfield, complex-field, refractive index, confocal, and widefield\nfluorescence imaging, establishing it as a promising solution for automated,\nhigh-throughput optical microscopy.",

In this work, we present an\nexperimental platform in which light-activated colloids dispersed in a nematic\nliquid crystal can (i) switch from directed to active Brownian motion depending\non the nematic anchoring and (ii) mechanically adjust their motility in\nresponse to crowding, effectively enforcing quorum-sensing interactions.

We characterize the dynamics of a\nsingle colloid and demonstrate that its motion is captured by an active\nBrownian particle model if the nematic anchoring is homeotropic, and by\ndirected self-propulsion along the nematic director if the anchoring is planar.\nNext, we investigate the many-body dynamics, showing that it undergoes a\nclustering phase separation through effective quorum-sensing interactions.

This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient\nframework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF)\nalgorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.\n  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier\nremoval techniques across multiple public datasets.\n  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly\navailable datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene.\nSince these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted\ntheir segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the\nrobustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation\nand remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors\nand a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a\nfast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for\nreal-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern\naugmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.\n  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance,\nachieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5\nof 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods,\nour model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.\n  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited\nfor real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study\nunderscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when\ndesigning effective AI systems for medical imaging.",

By integrating the full six-dimensional equations\nof motion and computing the complete Lyapunov spectrum, we confirm chaos and\nquantify phase-space contraction with high numerical precision.

    "abstract": "Cognitive reappraisal is a key strategy in emotion regulation, involving\nreinterpretation of emotionally charged stimuli to alter affective responses.\nDespite its central role in clinical and cognitive science, real-world\nreappraisal interventions remain cognitively demanding, abstract, and primarily\nverbal. This reliance on higher-order cognitive and linguistic processes is\noften impaired in individuals with trauma or depression, limiting the\neffectiveness of standard approaches. Here, we propose a novel, visually based\naugmentation of cognitive reappraisal by integrating large-scale text-to-image\ndiffusion models into the emotional regulation process. Specifically, we\nintroduce a system in which users reinterpret emotionally negative images via\nspoken reappraisals, which are transformed into supportive, emotionally\ncongruent visualizations using stable diffusion models with a fine-tuned\nIP-adapter. This generative transformation visually instantiates users'\nreappraisals while maintaining structural similarity to the original stimuli,\nexternalizing and reinforcing regulatory intent. To test this approach, we\nconducted a within-subject experiment (N = 20) using a modified cognitive\nemotion regulation (CER) task. Participants reappraised or described aversive\nimages from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), with or without\nAI-generated visual feedback. Results show that AI-assisted reappraisal\nsignificantly reduced negative affect compared to both non-AI and control\nconditions. Further analyses reveal that sentiment alignment between\nparticipant reappraisals and generated images correlates with affective relief,\nsuggesting that multimodal coherence enhances regulatory efficacy. These\nfindings demonstrate that generative visual input can support cogitive\nreappraisal and open new directions at the intersection of generative AI,\naffective computing, and therapeutic technology.",

As a result, applying spherically-symmetric models can result in\nsignificant biases. These biases can be mitigated by fitting a triaxial model,\nrequiring deep multiprobe data and a set of physically motivated models to\ndescribe them. Here we present a multiprobe triaxial analysis methodology based\non the data available for galaxy clusters in the Cluster Heritage project with\nXMM-Newton - Mass Assembly and Thermodynamics at Endpoint of structure\nformation (CHEX-MATE), which includes X-ray data from XMM-Newton, SZ data from\nPlanck and ACT, and WL data from Subaru. This work builds on our previous\ndevelopment of a gas-only X-ray and SZ triaxial fitting formalism in Paper I.\nWe apply our approach to the CHEX-MATE cluster PSZ2 G313.33+61.13 (Abell 1689)\nand find that it is elongated along the line of sight relative to the plane of\nsky by a factor of $\\mathcal{R}_{LP} = 1.27 \\pm 0.02$.

Additionally, we propose a comprehensive suite of benchmark datasets\nspecifically designed for realistic model evaluation by minimizing leakage,\nincreasing task difficulty, enhancing dataset diversity, and adjustment of base\nrates more likely to be seen in the real world. We train and evaluate multiple\nsolution approaches to provide baseline performance on the benchmark sets. We\nbelieve the availability of this dataset and benchmarks will enable realistic,\nstandardized model comparison and foster further advances in phishing\ndetection. The datasets and benchmarks are available on Hugging Face\n(https://huggingface.co/datasets/phreshphish/phreshphish).",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes fields\nwhere their decisions impact rights and equity. However, LLMs' judicial\nfairness and implications for social justice remain underexplored. When LLMs\nact as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite\nto ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we\nconstruct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a\nselection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to\nthe judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising\n177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop\nthree evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and\nintroduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across\nvarious labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive\ninconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring\nsevere LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more\npronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance\nlabels compared to procedure ones. Interestingly, increased inconsistency\ncorrelates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate\nbiases. While we find that adjusting the temperature parameter can influence\nLLM fairness, model size, release date, and country of origin do not exhibit\nsignificant effects on judicial fairness. Accordingly, we introduce a publicly\navailable toolkit containing all datasets and code, designed to support future\nresearch in evaluating and improving LLM fairness.",

While the determination of the ``free''\nelements is usually guided by the constraints of some experimental setup, this\ncan make it difficult to study similarities and differences between QRTs. In\nthis work, we argue that QRTs follow from the choice of a preferred algebraic\nstructure $\\mathcal{E}$ to be preserved, thus setting the free operations as\nthe automorphisms of $\\mathcal{E}$. We illustrate our finding by determining\n$\\mathcal{E}$ for the QRTs of entanglement, Clifford stabilizerness, purity,\nimaginarity, fermionic Gaussianity, reference frames, thermodynamics and\ncoherence; showing instances where $\\mathcal{E}$ is a Lie algebra, group, ring,\nor even a simple set. This unified understanding allows us to generalize the\nconcept of stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) to\nidentify novel resource non-increasing operations for Lie-algebra based QRTs,\nthus finding a new solution to an open problem in the literature. We showcase\nthe sanity of our new set of operations by rigorously proving that they map\nfree states to free states, as well as determine more general situations where\nthese transformations strictly do not increase the resource of a state.",

In this paper, we examine 399 candidate\nsingle late-M dwarfs with $G - G_{RP} \\geq 1.4$ mag ($\\gtrsim$M6) using TESS\nlight curves. To determine rotation periods, we employed Lomb-Scargle\nPeriodograms to provide a first estimate of the period, then refined them with\na Gaussian Process approach, requiring multi-sector confirmation when\navailable. We found 133 rotation periods, ranging from 2 hours to 6 days, and\namplitudes between 0.08% and 2.71%. We find that the observed variability\nfraction in late-M dwarfs rises with the number of available TESS sectors,\napproaching an apparent ceiling of ~50%. This likely reflects a detection limit\ndetermined by viewing geometry and supports the idea that spot-induced\nvariability is common across the late-M and brown dwarf population. In our\ncomparison with previously published late-M dwarf rotation periods reported, we\nfound consistent results, confirming or updating 31 periods. Our findings\nexpand the number of previously known late-M dwarf periods under 1 day by 76%.\nCombined with published rotation periods for a broader range of spectral types,\nwe find a lower envelope on the rotation period decreasing from 5 hours at\nearly-M dwarfs to 1 hour at L, T, and Y dwarfs.",

Fold-switching proteins challenge\nthis expectation by remodeling their secondary and/or tertiary structures in\nresponse to cellular stimuli.

The widening scope of fold switching draws\nattention to the ways it challenges conventional wisdom, raising fundamental\nunanswered questions about protein structure, biophysics, and evolution.

To overcome these challenges, we employ Conditional\nValue-at-Risk (CVaR), a popular coherent risk measure, and establish its\nequivalence with the sum-least-$\\alpha$th-quantile (SL$\\alpha$Q) utility. This\nconnection enables an exact convex reformulation of the SL$\\alpha$Q\nmaximization problem, facilitating analytical tractability and precise and\ninterpretable control over cell-edge terminal performance. Utilizing Lagrangian\nduality, we provide (for the first time) parameterized closed-form solutions\nfor the optimal resource policy -- which is of waterfilling-type -- as well as\nthe associated (auxiliary) Value-at-Risk variable. We further develop a novel\ninexact dual subgradient descent algorithm of minimal complexity to determine\nglobally optimal resource policies, and we rigorously establish its\nconvergence. The resulting edge waterfilling algorithm iteratively and\nefficiently allocates resources while explicitly ensuring transmission rate\nfairness across (cell-edge) terminals.

In this work, we explore how graph convolutional\nnetworks (GCNs) can be leveraged to efficiently solve constrained assortment\noptimization under the mixed multinomial logit choice model. We first develop a\ngraph representation of the assortment problem, then train a GCN to learn the\npatterns of optimal assortments, and lastly propose two inference policies\nbased on the GCN's output. Due to the GCN's inherent ability to generalize\nacross inputs of varying sizes, we can use a GCN trained on small-scale\ninstances to facilitate large-scale instances. Extensive numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that given a GCN trained on small-scale instances (e.g., with 20\nproducts), the proposed policies can achieve superior performance (90%+\noptimality) on large-scale instances (with up to 2,000 products) within\nseconds, which outperform existing heuristic policies in both performance and\nefficiency.

    "abstract": "Confinement in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), binding quarks and gluons into\nhadrons, is characterized by a linear potential and the Wilson loop area law.\nWe develop an analytical framework in $\\text{SU(3)}$ gauge theory, proposing a\nhybrid effective string model that integrates chromoelectric flux tubes with\ntopological corrections from \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\) center vortices. Using\nstrong-coupling expansion, we derive the Wilson loop expectation value,\nincorporating novel logarithmic vortex corrections, and compute a modified\nconfining potential with non-universal terms. A central focus is the\nentanglement entropy of a confined quark-antiquark pair, modeled as a\nphase-damping quantum channel driven by the $\\text{SU(3)}$ confining potential\nand vortex effects. We analytically demonstrate that confinement increases\nentropy, reflecting suppressed quantum correlations due to flux tube formation,\nwith vortices enhancing decoherence.

We consider\nparticles with competing short-range attraction and long-range repulsion\nsubjected to time-dependent oscillations of the ratio between the attractive\nand repulsive interaction terms, which causes the system to cycle periodically\nbetween crystal and bubble states.

Early and accurate detection of\ndementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.\nWhile classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been\nexplored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle\nwith high-dimensional biomedical data and large-scale datasets, quickly\nreaching computational and performance limitations. To address this challenge,\nquantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering\nfaster training and advanced pattern recognition capabilities.

Besides, we show the effect of\nnoise on the QTL-based approach, investigating the reliability and robustness\nof this method. Using the OASIS 2 dataset, we show how quantum techniques can\ntransform a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for\nbiomedical image classification, highlighting their potential impact on\nadvancing healthcare technology.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we explored how online hate is motivated by receiving social\napproval from others. We specifically examined two central tenets of Walther's\n(2024) social approval theory of online hate: (H1a) more signals of social\napproval on hate messages predicts more subsequent hate messages, and (H1b) as\nsocial approval increases, hate speech messages become more extreme. Using over\n110 million posts from Parler (2018-2021), we observed that the number of\nupvotes a person received on a hate speech post was unassociated with the\namount of hate speech in their next post and posts during the next week, month,\nthree months, and six months. Between-person effects revealed an average\nnegative relationship between social approval and hate speech production at the\npost level, but this relationship was mixed at other time intervals. Social\napproval reinforcement mechanisms of online hate may operate differently on\nniche social media platforms.",

Moreover, the rapid detection of\nattacks is essential, especially in critical infrastructure, to prevent\nlarge-scale disruptions. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time\nintrusion detection system based on a semi-supervised contrastive learning\nframework using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).

We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15,\nBoT-IoT, and Gas Pipeline, using only 2.20%, 1.28%, and 8% of labeled samples,\nrespectively, to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results show that\nour method outperforms existing contrastive learning-based approaches. We\nfurther compare KAN with a traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP),\ndemonstrating KAN's superior performance in both detection accuracy and\nrobustness under limited supervision.

To this end, we\npost-process the simulations with ionizing radiative transfer and perform Monte\nCarlo Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Lya) transfer calculations.

In FWI,\napproximations of the inverse of the Hessian may be used as preconditioners for\nNewton-type or quasi-Newton algorithms, reducing computational costs and\nimproving recovery in deeper subsurface regions. In Bayesian UQ, Hessian\napproximations enable the construction of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nproposals that capture the directional scalings of the posterior, enhancing the\nefficiency of MCMC. Computing the exact Hessian is intractable for large-scale\nproblems because the Hessian is accessible only through matrix-vector products,\nand performing each matrix-vector product requires costly solution of wave\nequations. Moreover, the Hessian is high-rank, which means that low-rank\nmethods, often employed in large-scale inverse problems, are inefficient. We\nadapt two existing high-rank Hessian approximations -- the point spread\nfunction method and the pseudo-differential operator probing method. Building\non an observed duality between these approaches, we develop a novel method that\nunifies their complementary strengths. We validate these methods on a synthetic\nquadratic model and on the Marmousi model. Numerical experiments show that\nthese high-rank Hessian approximations substantially reduce the computational\ncosts in FWI. In UQ, MCMC samples computed using no Hessian approximation or a\nlow-rank approximation explore the posterior slowly, providing little\nmeaningful statistical information after tens of thousands of iterations and\nunderestimating the variance. At the same time, the effective sample size is\noverestimated, providing false confidence.

For interventions targeting\nhabitual behavior (e.g., oral hygiene), effectiveness often hinges on\ndelivering support shortly before the target behavior is likely to occur.\nCurrent practice schedules decision points at a fixed interval (e.g., one hour)\nbefore user-provided behavior times, and the fixed interval is kept the same\nfor all individuals. However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly\nfor individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after\nthe target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective.\nIn this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule\ndecision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times. When behavior\ntiming is more predictable, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points closer to\nthe predicted behavior time; when timing is less certain, SigmaScheduling\nschedules decision points earlier, increasing the likelihood of timely\nintervention.

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of antibody levels is crucial for characterizing\nthe time-dependent response to immune events: either infections or\nvaccinations. The sequence and timing of these events significantly influence\nantibody level changes. Despite extensive interest in the topic in the recent\nyears and many experimental studies, the effect of immune event sequences on\nantibody levels is not well understood. Moreover, disease or vaccination\nprevalence in the population are time-dependent. This, alongside the\ncomplexities of personal antibody kinetics, makes it difficult to analyze a\nsample immune measurement from a population. As a solution, we design a\nrigorous mathematical characterization in terms of a time-inhomogeneous Markov\nchain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic\nframework for the post-event antibody kinetics of multiple immune events. We\ndemonstrate that this is an ideal model for immune event sequences, referred to\nas personal trajectories. This novel modeling framework surpasses the\nsusceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) characterizations by rigorously tracking\nthe probability distribution of population antibody response across time. To\nillustrate our ideas, we apply our mathematical framework to longitudinal\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) data from\nindividuals with multiple documented infection and vaccination events. Our work\nis an important step towards a comprehensive understanding of antibody kinetics\nthat could lead to an effective way to analyze the protective power of natural\nimmunity or vaccination, predict missed immune events at an individual level,\nand inform booster timing recommendations.",

While recent\nstudies have introduced some methods to improve prediction performance, these\napproaches still face a significant challenge in handling long-term\nextrapolation tasks under such complex scenarios. To overcome this challenge,\nwe propose Phy-SSM, a generalizable method that integrates partial physics\nknowledge into state space models (SSMs) for long-term dynamics forecasting in\ncomplex environments. Our motivation is that SSMs can effectively capture\nlong-range dependencies in sequential data and model continuous dynamical\nsystems, while the incorporation of physics knowledge improves generalization\nability. The key challenge lies in how to seamlessly incorporate partially\nknown physics into SSMs. To achieve this, we decompose partially known system\ndynamics into known and unknown state matrices, which are integrated into a\nPhy-SSM unit. To further enhance long-term prediction performance, we introduce\na physics state regularization term to make the estimated latent states align\nwith system dynamics. Besides, we theoretically analyze the uniqueness of the\nsolutions for our method. Extensive experiments on three real-world\napplications, including vehicle motion prediction, drone state prediction, and\nCOVID-19 epidemiology forecasting, demonstrate the superior performance of\nPhy-SSM over the baselines in both long-term interpolation and extrapolation\ntasks.

    "abstract": "Storage and retrieval refer to the task of encoding an unknown quantum\nchannel $\\Lambda$ into a quantum state, known as the program state, such that\nthe channel can later be retrieved. There are two strategies for this task:\nclassical and quantum strategies. The classical strategy uses multiple queries\nto $\\Lambda$ to estimate $\\Lambda$ and retrieves the channel based on the\nestimate represented in classical bits. The classical strategy turns out to\noffer the optimal performance for the storage and retrieval of unitary\nchannels. In this work, we analyze the asymptotic performance of the classical\nand quantum strategies for the storage and retrieval of isometry channels. We\nshow that the optimal fidelity for isometry estimation is given by $F =\n1-{d(D-d)\\over n} + O(n^{-2})$, where $d$ and $D$ denote the input and output\ndimensions of the isometry, and $n$ is the number of queries. This result\nindicates that, unlike in the case of unitary channels, the classical strategy\nis suboptimal for the storage and retrieval of isometry channels, which\nrequires $n = \\Theta(\\epsilon^{-1})$ to achieve the diamond-norm error\n$\\epsilon$. We propose a more efficient quantum strategy based on port-based\nteleportation, which stores the isometry channel in a program state using only\n$n = \\Theta(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ queries, achieving a quadratic improvement over\nthe classical strategy. As an application, we extend our approach to general\nquantum channels, achieving improved program cost compared to prior results by\nGschwendtner, Bluhm, and Winter [Quantum 5, 488 (2021)].",

The LF formulation provides an alternative computational\napproach to lattice gauge theory, and has recently been investigated as a\nfuture application of quantum computers. A natural question is how quantum\nresources such as entanglement and contextuality amongst physical qubits in the\nlaboratory are utilized in LF simulations of QFTs. We use the (1+1)D\ntransverse-field Ising model to explore this question. We derive the LF energy\noperator that generates the LF dynamics of the system, which is distinct from\nthe instant-form (IF) Hamiltonian. We find that while the eigenstates of the IF\nHamiltonian exhibit pairwise entanglement between positive and negative momenta\nin IF momentum-space, the eigenstates of the LF Hamiltonian are separable in LF\nmomentum-space. We then calculate the momentum-space magic of the\nIF-momentum-space ground state and show that it always requires more magic to\nprepare than the LF-momentum-space ground state. At the quantum critical point,\ncorresponding to a massless free fermion, both LF and IF ground states are\nstabilizers, but the LF ground state is separable in LF momentum-space while\nthe IF ground state is a product of maximally entangled pairs in IF\nmomentum-space.

We showcase the\neffectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an\naverage object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art\nUOIS methods.

Existing weighting methods\neither assume positivity holds or produce effects that conflate interventions'\nimpacts on ultimate outcomes with their effects on intermediate treatments and\ncovariates. We propose a novel class of estimands -- cumulative cross-world\nweighted effects -- that weights potential outcome differences using propensity\nscores adapting to positivity violations cumulatively across timepoints and\nsimultaneously across both counterfactual treatment histories. This new\nestimand isolates mechanistic differences between treatment regimes, is\nidentifiable without positivity assumptions, and circumvents the limitations of\nexisting longitudinal methods. Further, our analysis reveals two fundamental\ninsights about longitudinal causal inference under positivity violations.\nFirst, while mechanistically meaningful, these effects correspond to\nnon-implementable interventions, exposing a core\ninterpretability-implementability tradeoff. Second, the identified effects\nfaithfully capture mechanistic differences only under a partial common support\nassumption; violations cause the identified functional to collapse to zero,\neven when the causal effect is non-zero. We develop doubly robust-style\nestimators that achieve asymptotic normality and parametric convergence under\nnonparametric assumptions on the nuisance estimators.

We start by analyzing the dynamics of the Pauli coefficients\ntracked in the Heisenberg picture. In addition to surprisingly generic\nconvergence features of the Pauli coefficient distributions, we find certain\nregularities that allow for extrapolation of memory and runtime requirements\nfor smaller and smaller coefficient truncation parameter $\\delta$. We then\nintroduce a framework for understanding convergence in the absence of rigorous\nerror guarantees on PPS. Combined with runtime analysis, we propose bifurcating\nquantum simulation problems broadly into two classes, based on whether there is\napparent convergence of expectation values as a function of $\\delta$. This\nserves as a way for practitioners to understand where their problem falls on\nthe frontier of classical simulability. In the case without apparent\nconvergence, PPS may still serve useful as a Monte Carlo-like estimate. Applied\nto IBM's utility-scale experiments, we show parameter regimes where both\nbehaviors are realized. Some of our key findings challenge conventional\nintuition: reducing $\\delta$ does not always improve accuracy, and deeper\nquantum circuits may actually be easier to simulate than shallower ones. The\nBlueQubit SDK implementing these methods has been released publicly, offering\nresearchers a comprehensive toolkit for evaluating this frontier classical\nsimulation approach.

    "abstract": "Being one of the most populated mean motion resonances (MMR) with Neptune and\nlying close to the inner boundary of the present day cold classical disk,\nobservations of the orbital and surface class distributions of the plutinos in\nthe 3:2 MMR provide constraints on Neptune's migration and insight into the\ncompositional structure of the pre-migration planetesimal disk. Here, we\npresent observations of the surface reflectance of 43 small to mid-size (H_V >~\n5) transneptunian objects (TNOs) through the grz wavelength range, 14 of which\nare plutinos. We classify the surfaces of these TNOs using the two-surface\nclass model (FaintIR and BrightIR surface classes) proposed by Fraser and\ncollaborators, where the FaintIR surface class is dominated by cold classicals.\nIncorporating similar observations of plutinos from the literature for a total\nsample size of 43 plutinos, we find that the osculating inclination\ndistributions (i_osc) of the FaintIR and BrightIR plutinos are statistically\ndistinguishable at 99.3% significance, where (6/7) of the plutinos with i_osc >\n4.5{\\deg} have FaintIR surfaces. This is most easily explained if the FaintIR\nand BrightIR planetesimals were radially partitioned in the primordial\nplanetesimal disk before being captured into the 3:2 resonance. While this\ncould be evidence that the primordial cold classical disk with FaintIR surfaces\nwas broader in the past by ~3 au in the sunward direction, we cannot rule out\nthe alternative explanation that these FaintIR plutinos were scattered from the\n~42.5-48 au region from the Sun and captured into the 3:2 resonance.",

Detecting such photons would impose\nconstraints on monopole properties. Despite strong theoretical motivations and\nextensive experimental searches, no monopoles have been observed to date. A\npossible explanation beyond high monopole masses arises from Staruszkiewicz's\nquantum theory of infrared electromagnetic fields.

An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER\nalgorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and\nskin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices\nemployed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two\nstate-of-the-art FER datasets.

It is assumed that particle-antiparticle pair creation\noccurs; however, the system is simultaneously subject to exact charge (isospin)\nconservation. To implement this constraint, we first consider the system within\nthe Grand Canonical Ensemble and then transform to the Canonical Ensemble using\na Legendre transformation. This procedure provides a formally consistent scheme\nfor incorporating the chemical potential at the microscopic level into the\nCanonical Ensemble framework. To enforce exact conservation of charge (isospin,\nN_I), we further analyze the thermodynamic properties of the system within the\nextended Canonical Ensemble, in which the chemical potential becomes a\nthermodynamic function of the temperature and conserved charge. It is shown\nthat as the temperature decreases, the system undergoes a second-order phase\ntransition to a Bose-Einstein condensate at the critical temperature T_c, but\nonly when the conserved charge is finite, N_I=const \\ne 0. In a\nparticle-antiparticle system, the condensate forms exclusively in the component\nwith the dominant particle number density, which determines the excess charge.\nWe demonstrate that the symmetry breaking of the ground state at T=0 results\nfrom a first-order phase transition associated with the formation of a\nBose-Einstein condensate. Although the transition involves symmetry breaking,\nit is not spontaneous in the strict field-theoretic sense, but is instead\ninduced by the external injection of particles. Potential experimental signals\nof Bose-Einstein condensation of pions produced in high-energy nuclear\ncollisions are briefly discussed.",

This has sparked\nsignificant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with\nthe necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and\nAI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy\nconsumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering\nboth near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and\nbeyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net\npositive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally,\nwe discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive\nworkflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and\nconsumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely\nstrain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and\ntherefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of\nbig data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and\ncomplex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and\napplications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more\npromising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction. Its\nability to further automate and optimize processes across industries, from\nenergy production to logistics, could significantly decrease our carbon\nfootprint. This positive impact is anticipated to outweigh the initial\nemissions bump, creating value for businesses and society in areas where\ntraditional solutions have fallen short.

Emerging neuromorphic architectures aim to combine traditional\ndigital designs with the computational efficiency of analog computing and novel\ndevice technologies. A crucial problem in the rapid exploration and co-design\nof such architectures is the lack of tools for fast and accurate modeling and\nsimulation. Typical mixed-signal design tools integrate a digital simulator\nwith an analog solver like SPICE, which is prohibitively slow for large\nsystems. By contrast, behavioral modeling of analog components is faster, but\nexisting approaches are fixed to specific architectures with limited energy and\nperformance modeling. In this paper, we propose LASANA, a novel approach that\nleverages machine learning to derive data-driven surrogate models of analog\nsub-blocks in a digital backend architecture. LASANA uses SPICE-level\nsimulations of a circuit to train ML models that predict circuit energy,\nperformance, and behavior at analog/digital interfaces. Such models can provide\nenergy and performance annotation on top of existing behavioral models or\nfunction as replacements to analog simulation. We apply LASANA to an analog\ncrossbar array and a spiking neuron circuit.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in\nnumerous applications requiring robust long-range capabilities, essential for\nprocessing extensive input contexts and continuously generating extended\noutputs. As sequence lengths increase, the number of Key-Value (KV) pairs in\nLLMs escalates, creating a significant efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we\npropose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free\nmethod for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables\nLLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range\nmodeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without\nrunning out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key\ninnovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only\nsequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from\nshallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range\ndependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range\ncapabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively\ncompresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache\nsize. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective\ncontinuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across\nvarious tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's\neffectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities.

Thus, organizations\ninvolved in the fight against sex trafficking often use ASW data when\nattempting to identify potential sex trafficking victims. A critical challenge\nin transforming ASW data into actionable insight is text analysis. Previous\nresearch using ASW data has shown that ASW ad text is important for linking\nads. However, working with this text is challenging due to its extensive use of\nemojis, poor grammar, and deliberate obfuscation to evade law enforcement\nscrutiny. We conduct a comprehensive study of language modeling approaches for\nthis application area, including simple information retrieval methods,\npre-trained transformers, and custom transformer models. We demonstrate that\ncharacteristics of ASW text data allow efficient custom transformer models to\nbe trained with relatively small GPU resources and used efficiently for\ninference on consumer hardware.

However, because of the high level of\nmeasurement noise, current reconstruction methods still leave room for\nimprovement. Furthermore, reconstruction efforts typically focus only on a\nsingle aspect of the signal, such as the energy fluence or arrival time.\nBayesian inference is then a natural choice for a holistic approach to\nreconstruction, yet, this problem would be ill-posed, since the electric field\nis a continuous quantity. Information Field Theory provides the solution for\nthis by providing a statistical framework to deal with discretised fields in\nthe continuum limit. We are currently developing models for this novel approach\nto reconstructing extensive air showers. The model described here is based on\nthe best current understanding of the emission mechanisms: It uses\nparametrisations of the lateral signal strength distribution, charge-excess\ncontribution and spectral shape. Shower-to-shower fluctuations and narrowband\nRFI are modelled using Gaussian processes. Combined with a detailed detector\ndescription, this model can infer not only the electric field, but also the\nshower geometry, electromagnetic energy and position of shower maximum. Another\nbig achievement of this approach is its ability to naturally provide\nuncertainties for the reconstruction, which has been shown to be difficult in\nmore traditional methods. With such an open framework and robust computational\nmethods based in Information Field Theory, it will also be easy to incorporate\nnew insights and additional data, such as timing distributions or particle\ndetector data, in the future. This approach has a high potential to exploit the\nfull information content of a complex detector with rigorous statistical\nmethods, in a way that directly includes domain knowledge.",

First, we extend the finite,\nnonlocal quantum field theories to derive a modified Bethe--Salpeter equation\nfor heavy quark--antiquark bound states, incorporating exponential regulator\nfunctions that render all loop amplitudes UV finite. We show that nonlocal\npropagators induce characteristic shifts in the resonance mass and width, which\ncan be contrasted directly with LHC data. By fixing the nonlocal regulator\nscale in the strong sector, our framework yields a prediction of an $\\approx\n8.3\\,\\mathrm{pb}$ enhancement, in excellent agreement with the CMS measurement\nof $8.8 \\pm 1.3\\,\\mathrm{pb}$. We analyze the renormalization group flow of the\nstrong coupling near the top--pair threshold, introducing a holomorphic\ndeformation inspired by unified field--theoretic constructions. We find that\nthe modified $\\beta$-function softens the running of $\\alpha_s$, giving an\nenhancement of the threshold cross-section. Third, we present a systematic\ncomparison of charmonium, bottomonium, and toponium, quantifying differences in\nbinding energies, lifetimes, and production signatures. In particular, the top\nquark's large width precludes long-lived bound states, so that toponium appears\nonly as a transient threshold resonance. Taken together, our results\ndemonstrate that toponium not only probes nonlocal UV completions of QCD but\nalso offers a novel window onto holomorphic renormalization group dynamics and\nthe broader phenomenology of heavy quarkonium.",

Attempts to extend Scarf's celebrated distribution-free ordering\nrule using risk measures have led to conflicting prescriptions: CVaR-based\nmodels invariably recommend ordering less as risk aversion increases, while\nmean-standard deviation models -- paradoxically -- suggest ordering more,\nparticularly when ordering costs are high. We resolve this behavioral paradox\nthrough a coherent generalization of Scarf's distribution-free framework,\nmodeling risk aversion via distortion functionals from dual utility theory.\nDespite the generality of this class, we derive closed-form optimal ordering\nrules for any coherent risk preference. These rules uncover a consistent\nbehavioral principle: a more risk-averse newsvendor may rationally order more\nwhen overstocking is inexpensive (i.e., when the cost-to-price ratio is low),\nbut will always order less when ordering is costly. Our framework offers a more\nnuanced, managerially intuitive, and behaviorally coherent understanding of\nrisk-averse inventory decisions. It exposes the limitations of non-coherent\nmodels, delivers interpretable and easy-to-compute ordering rules grounded in\ncoherent preferences, and unifies prior work under a single, tractable\napproach.

During\ninference, the model maintains high accuracy on benign samples but\nmisclassifies poisoned samples into an attacker-specified target class.\nExisting research on backdoor attacks has explored developing triggers in the\nspatial, spectral (frequency), and semantic (feature) domains, aiming to make\nthem stealthy. While some approaches have considered designing triggers that\nare imperceptible in both spatial and spectral domains, few have incorporated\nthe semantic domain. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack, termed\n3S-attack, which is stealthy across the spatial, spectral, and semantic\ndomains. The key idea is to exploit the semantic features of benign samples as\ntriggers, using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and a\npreliminary model for extraction. The trigger is then embedded in the spectral\ndomain, followed by pixel-level restrictions after converting the samples back\nto the spatial domain. This process minimizes the distance between poisoned and\nbenign samples, making the attack harder to detect by existing defenses and\nhuman inspection.

By introducing entire-function\nregulators $F(\\Box) = \\exp\\!\\bigl(\\Box / M_*^2\\bigr)$ into the holomorphic\nEinstein-Hilbert action, we achieve perturbative UV finiteness at all loop\norders, while preserving BRST invariance and holomorphic gauge symmetry. We\nderive the modified gauge-gravity coupling sector, perform a one-loop\neffective-action computation in a contour-regularized metric background, and\ndemonstrate the absence of new counterterms and problematic complex-pole\nstructures. Extending the construction to nontrivial curved backgrounds, we\nverify infrared recovery of General Relativity and full holomorphic gauge\ninvariance. Finally, we explore phenomenological consequences, including\ncorrected graviton and gauge-boson scattering amplitudes in self-dual\nbackgrounds, finite Hawking spectra for regularized Schwarzschild and Kerr\ngeometries, and proposed tests of the equivalence principle. This work lays the\nfoundation for a self-consistent, unitary four-dimensional quantum-gravity and\nHolomorphic Unified Field Theory framework.",

Just-in-time vulnerability prediction (JIT-VP)\nis a proactive approach to identifying vulnerable commits and providing early\nwarnings about potential security risks. However, we observe that current\nJIT-VP evaluations rely on an idealized setting, where the evaluation datasets\nare artificially balanced, consisting exclusively of vulnerability-introducing\nand vulnerability-fixing commits. To address this limitation, this study\nassesses the effectiveness of JIT-VP techniques under a more realistic setting\nthat includes both vulnerability-related and vulnerability-neutral commits. To\nenable a reliable evaluation, we introduce a large-scale public dataset\ncomprising over one million commits from FFmpeg and the Linux kernel. Our\nempirical analysis of eight state-of-the-art JIT-VP techniques reveals a\nsignificant decline in predictive performance when applied to real-world\nconditions; for example, the average PR-AUC on Linux drops 98% from 0.805 to\n0.016. This discrepancy is mainly attributed to the severe class imbalance in\nreal-world datasets, where vulnerability-introducing commits constitute only a\nsmall fraction of all commits. To mitigate this issue, we explore the\neffectiveness of widely adopted techniques for handling dataset imbalance,\nincluding customized loss functions, oversampling, and undersampling.\nSurprisingly, our experimental results indicate that these techniques are\nineffective in addressing the imbalance problem in JIT-VP. These findings\nunderscore the importance of realistic evaluations of JIT-VP and the need for\ndomain-specific techniques to address data imbalance in such scenarios.",

We propose EDR-MQ (Extracting Document Relations by\nMarginalizing over User Queries), a novel framework that discovers document\nrelationships through query marginalization. EDR-MQ is based on the insight\nthat strongly related documents often co-occur in results across diverse user\nqueries, enabling us to estimate joint probabilities between document pairs by\nmarginalizing over a collection of queries. To enable this query\nmarginalization approach, we develop Multiply Conditioned Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (MC-RAG), which employs conditional retrieval where subsequent\ndocument retrievals depend on previously retrieved content. By observing\nco-occurrence patterns across diverse queries, EDR-MQ estimates joint\nprobabilities between document pairs without requiring labeled training data or\npredefined taxonomies. Experimental results show that our query marginalization\napproach successfully identifies meaningful document relationships, revealing\ntopical clusters, evidence chains, and cross-domain connections that are not\napparent through traditional similarity-based methods.

    "abstract": "Intermediate-valence behavior is sometimes observed in lanthanide-based\nmaterials containing Ce, Yb, Sm or Eu. However, the number of actinide-based\nsystems that exhibit this type of behavior is rather limited. In this work, we\npresent the discovery and characterization of a uranium compound U2Rh2Sb, which\nturns out to be a candidate for the intermediate-valencebehavior. The material\nshows a characteristic feature in the magnetic susceptibility around T = 50 K,\nwhich can be described within the interconfiguration-fluctuation model of\nintermediate valence systems. We find the energy difference between the\n5f3(U3+) and 5f2(U4+) states to be $\\delta$Eex/kB $\\approx$ 400 K and the\ncorresponding valence fluctuation temperature to be Tvf $\\approx$ 140 K. The\nvalue of the electronic specific heat coefficient $\\gamma$ = 50 mJ mol-1 U K-2\nsignals a modest electron effective mass enhancement. The electrical\nresistivity indicates metallic behavior, albeit with a small residual\nresistivity ratio. Measurements of thermoelectric properties indicate a change\nof sign in the Seebeck coefficient around T = 100 K, with a minimum achieved at\nT = 50 K, which coincides with the broad peak observed in magnetic\nsusceptibility. The experimental results are compared with the theoretical\nanalysis, based on the first-principles calculations, including lattice\ndynamics.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Context. The Dust Settling Instabilty (DSI) is a member of the Resonant Drag\nInstabilities (RDI) family, and is thus related to the Streaming Instability\n(SI). Linear calculations found that the unstratified monodisperse DSI has\ngrowth rates much higher than the SI even with lower initial dust to gas\nratios. However, recent nonlinear investigation found no evidence of strong\ndust clumping at the saturation level. Aims. To investigate the nonlinear\nsaturation of the mono- and polydisperse DSI. We examine the convergence\nbehaviour wrt. both the numerical resolution and the number of species. By\ncharacterising the morphology of the dust evolution triggered by the DSI, we\ncan shed more light on its role in planetesimal formation. Methods. We perform\na suite of 2D shearing box hydro simulations with the code Idefix, both in the\nmono- and polydisperse regimes. We focus on the time evolution of the maximum\ndust density, noting the time at which the instability is triggered, as well as\nanalyse the morphology of the resultant structure. Results. In our monodisperse\nsimulations, the maximum dust density increases and the instability saturates\nearlier with higher spatial resolution, with no signs of convergence. The\npolydisperse simulations do seem to converge with the number of species and\nproduce maximum dust densities that are comparable to, albeit lower than, the\nmonodisperse simulations. Different dust species tend to form adjacent but\nseparate dust filaments, which may have implications on dust growth and further\nclumping. Conclusions. The monodisperse DSI produces dust structure at\ndensities high enough that likely leads to clumping. The polydisperse DSI\nproduces lower but comparable dust densities. Our idealised treatment suggests\nthat the DSI is important for planetesimal formation, as it suffers less than\nthe SI from including a dust size distribution.",

We then use our approach as impurity solver for\ndynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to address the case of a two-orbital,\nrealistic layered structure, recovering the strong crystal-field-driven charge\npolarization observed by solving the DMFT self-consistent cycle with QMC,\nalbeit slightly reduced. Finally, we address a prototype nonequilibrium setup\nby sandwiching this layer between metallic contacts subject to a bias voltage\ndescribed by different chemical potentials. This simplified model demonstrates\nout method's potential to access nonequilibrium steady-state behavior of\nmulti-orbital, realistic materials. These findings provide a first-step basis\nfor theoretical studies of nonequilibrium properties of multi-orbital compounds\ndirectly in the real frequency domain.",

Our analysis employs a full-band continuum\nmodel to capture the relevant physical phenomena.

We observe sharp resonant\ntunneling features emerging from quantum interference effects induced by\nmagnetic confinement. A key outcome of our study is the discovery of distinct\nresonance patterns in the conduction and valence bands. These patterns are\nclosely related to the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in MoS$_2$ and the\nbreaking of time-reversal symmetry by the magnetic field. This results in\nsignificant spin and valley selectivity in electron transport. We demonstrate\nthat adjusting external parameters precisely controls spin-polarized and\nvalley-polarized currents. We show that a magnetic barrier can control electron\nspin and valley in MoS$_2$, making it a promising platform for energy-efficient\nspintronic and valleytronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Spectroscopic anomaly detection and isotope identification algorithms are\nintegral components in nuclear nonproliferation applications such as search\noperations. The task is especially challenging in the case of mobile detector\nsystems due to the fact that the observed gamma-ray background changes more\nthan for a static detector system, and a pretrained background model can easily\nfind itself out of domain. The result is that algorithms may exceed their\nintended false alarm rate, or sacrifice detection sensitivity in order to\nmaintain the desired false alarm rate. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)\nhas been shown to be a powerful tool for spectral anomaly detection and\nidentification, but, like many similar algorithms that rely on data-driven\nbackground models, in its conventional implementation it is unable to update in\nreal time to account for environmental changes that affect the background\nspectroscopic signature. We have developed a novel NMF-based algorithm that\nperiodically updates its background model to accommodate changing environmental\nconditions. The Adaptive NMF algorithm involves fewer assumptions about its\nenvironment, making it more generalizable than existing NMF-based methods while\nmaintaining or exceeding detection performance on simulated and real-world\ndatasets.",

We introduce a neural-surrogate\n(neural-network--based approximation of the posterior distribution) framework\nthat predicts the coefficients of known covariate-dependent rate functions\ndirectly from noisy, partially observed token trajectories. Our model employs a\nlightweight 1D Convolutional Residual Network trained end-to-end on\nGillespie-simulated SPN realizations, learning to invert system dynamics under\nrealistic conditions of event dropout. During inference, Monte Carlo dropout\nprovides calibrated uncertainty bounds together with point estimates. On\nsynthetic SPNs with 20% missing events, our surrogate recovers rate-function\ncoefficients with an RMSE = 0.108 and substantially runs faster than\ntraditional Bayesian approaches.

These ETCRs provide us with the\nvanishing four-dimensional commutation relation, which implies that the metric\ntensor behaves as if it were not a quantum operator but a classical field. In\nthis case, the micro-causality is valid at least for the metric tensor in an\nobvious manner.

For turbines experiencing\nstall-flutter instability, the influence of gravity on performance metrics is\nminimal when inertial forces dominate or are comparable to gravitational\nforces. At high Froude numbers, buoyancy and weight are negligible, but their\nimpact increases at lower Froude numbers, leading to reduced performance.\nConversely, turbines operating through coupled-flutter instability seem\nunsuitable for horizontal configurations since they require high foil moment of\ninertia and mass, which amplifies the effects of buoyancy and weight, thereby\ndiminishing performance at any Froude number.",

We first\ncompute a locality graph on d-simplices, using the dihedral angle in between\nadjacent simplices as the graph weights, and then compute infinity path\ndistances in this simplex graph. This procedure gives a metric on simplices\nwhich we refer to as the largest angle path distance (LAPD). We analyze the\nproperties of LAPD under random sampling, and prove that with an appropriate\ndenoising procedure, this metric separates the manifold components with high\nprobability. We validate the proposed methodology with extensive numerical\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets. These experiments\ndemonstrate that the method is robust to noise, curvature, and small\nintersection angle, and generally out-performs other MMC algorithms. In\naddition, we provide a highly scalable implementation of the proposed\nalgorithm, which leverages approximation schemes for infinity path distance to\nachieve quasi-linear computational complexity.",

They play an important role in areas\nsuch as coding theory, optimization, and combinatorial geometry, where linear\nstructure is crucial for both theoretical insights and algorithmic\napplications. Since deciding skew-representability is computationally\nintractable, much effort has been focused on identifying necessary or\nsufficient conditions for a matroid to be skew-representable.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to studying\nskew-representability and structural properties of matroids and polymatroid\nfunctions via tensor products. We provide a characterization of\nskew-representable matroids, as well as of those representable over skew fields\nof a given prime characteristic, in terms of tensor products. As an algorithmic\nconsequence, we show that deciding skew-representability, or representability\nover a skew field of fixed prime characteristic, is co-recursively enumerable:\nthat is, certificates of non-skew-representability -- in general or over a\nfixed prime characteristic -- can be verified. We also prove that every rank-3\nmatroid admits a tensor product with any uniform matroid and give a\nconstruction yielding the unique freest tensor product in this setting.\nFinally, as an application of the tensor product framework, we give a new proof\nof Ingleton's inequality and, more importantly, derive the first known linear\nrank inequality for folded skew-representable matroids that does not follow\nfrom the common information property.",

    "abstract": "In this study we introduce a symbolic dataset composed of non-metric Iranian\nclassical music, and algorithms for structural parsing of this music, and\ngeneration of variations. The corpus comprises MIDI files and data sheets of\nDastgah Shour from Radif Mirza Abdollah, the foundational repertoire of Iranian\nclassical music. Furthermore, we apply our previously-introduced algorithm for\nparsing melodic structure (Kanani et al., 2023b)to the dataset. Unlike much\nWestern music, this type of non-metric music does not follow bar-centric\norganisation. The non-metric organisation can be captured well by our parsing\nalgorithm. We parse each tune (Gusheh) into a grammar to identify motifs and\nphrases. These grammar representations can be useful for educational and\nethnomusicological purposes. We also further develop a previously-introduced\nmethod of creating melodic variations (Kanani et al., 2023b). After parsing an\nexisting tune to produce a grammar, by applying mutations to this grammar, we\ngenerate a new grammar. Expanding this new version yields a variation of the\noriginal tune. Variations are assessed by a domain-expert listener.\nAdditionally, we conduct a statistical analysis of mutation with different\nrepresentation setups for our parsing and generation algorithms. The\noverarching conclusion is that the system successfully produces acceptable\nvariations post-mutation. While our case study focuses on Iranian classical\nmusic, the methodology can be adapted for Arabic or Turkish classical music.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Disordered pinning models are statistical mechanics models built on discrete\nrenewal processes: renewal epochs in this context are called contacts. It is\nwell known that pinning models can undergo a localization/delocalization phase\ntransition: in the localized phase the typical density of contacts is positive\nand the largest gap between contacts is at most of the order of the logarithm\nof the size $n$ of the system, whereas the system is void of contacts in the\ndelocalized phase. When disorder is absent and the phase transition is\ndiscontinuous, conditioning the contact density to be positive but smaller than\nthe minimum typical density in the localized phase has the effect of forcing to\ncreate one, and only one, macroscopic gap between two contacts, while the rest\nof the configuration keeps the characteristics of a localized state. However it\nis known that, in the presence of (bounded) disorder, this big jump phenomenon\nis no longer observed, in the sense that the largest gap in the conditioned\nsystem is $o(n)$. Under minimal integrability conditions on the disorder we\nshow that the conditioned system is localized in a very strong sense, in\nparticular the largest gap is $O(\\log n)$. The proof is achieved by exploiting\nthe improved understanding of the localized phase of disordered pinning models\ndeveloped in [34] and by establishing some refined estimates, in particular a\nquenched Local Central Limit Theorem. We also present an analysis of the effect\nof disorder on the large deviation rate function of the contact density and, as\nan important ingredient for the generality of our results, we establish a\nsmoothing inequality for pinning models under minimal integrability conditions,\nthus generalizing [11,32].",

    "abstract": "Two-fold redundant sparse arrays (TFRAs) are designed to maintain accurate\ndirection estimation even in the event of a single sensor failure, leveraging\nthe deliberate coarray redundancy infused into their design. Robust Minimum\nRedundancy Arrays (RMRAs), a specialized class of TFRAs, optimize this\nredundancy to achieve the maximum possible aperture for a given number of\nsensors. However, finding optimal RMRA configurations is an NP-hard problem,\nwith prior research reporting optimal solutions only for arrays of up to ten\nsensors. This paper presents newly discovered optimal RMRA configurations for\narray sizes 11 to 15, identified using a novel Leap-on-Success exhaustive\nsearch algorithm that efficiently reduces computational effort by terminating\nthe search upon locating optimal solutions. The robustness of these arrays was\nvalidated under all single-element failure scenarios using MATLAB simulations,\nconfirming their superior resilience compared to some existing TFRAs vulnerable\nto failures at specific sensor positions. Furthermore, near-optimal\nconfigurations for array sizes 16 to 20 are also reported, highlighting the\npotential applicability of the proposed method for larger array designs given\nsufficient computational resources. This work not only advances the\nstate-of-the-art in RMRA design but also introduces an effective search\nmethodology that can be leveraged for future explorations in array\nconfiguration optimization.",

    "abstract": "Developing accurate numerical methods for strongly interacting fermions is\ncrucial for improving our understanding of various quantum many-body phenomena,\nespecially unconventional superconductivity. Recently, neural quantum states\nhave emerged as a promising approach for studying correlated fermions,\nhighlighted by the hidden fermion and backflow methods, which use neural\nnetworks to model corrections to fermionic quasiparticle orbitals. In this\nwork, we expand these ideas to the space of Pfaffians, a wave-function that\nnaturally expresses superconducting pairings, and propose the hidden fermion\nPfaffian state (HFPS), which flexibly represents both unpaired and\nsuperconducting phases and scales to large systems with favorable asymptotic\ncomplexity. In our numerical experiments, HFPS provides state-of-the-art\nvariational accuracy in different regimes of both the attractive and repulsive\nHubbard models. We show that the HFPS is able to capture both s-wave and d-wave\npairing, and therefore may be a useful tool for modeling phases with\nunconventional superconductivity.",

    "abstract": "Seasonally adjusted series are usually used to analyse the business cycle and\nturning points. When the irregular is too high, it is preferable to smooth the\nseries in order to analyse the trend-cycle component directly. This study\nfocuses on the real-time estimation of the trend-cycle component around shocks\nand turning points. The linear moving averages classically used for estimating\nthe trend-cycle, which are sensitive to the presence of atypical points, are\ncompared with robust non-linear methods. We also propose a methodology for\nextending the Henderson and Musgrave moving averages to take account of\nexternal information and thus construct moving averages that are robust to the\npresence of certain shocks. We describe how to estimate confidence intervals\nfor estimates derived from moving averages, thereby validating the use of these\nnew moving averages. By comparing the methods on simulated and real series, we\nshow that: building robust moving averages makes it possible to reduce\nrevisions and better model turning points around shocks, without degrading the\nestimates when no shock is observed; robust non-linear methods do not make it\npossible to extract a trend-cycle component that is satisfactory for economic\nanalysis, with sometimes significant revisions.

However, interpreting\nthese lines is complicated by factors including sample and data bias, mismatch\nbetween resolved calibrations and unresolved observations, limitations in\ngeneralizing from case studies, and unresolved issues like the origin of [C II]\nemission and the so-called ``deficit.''In this series of papers, we assemble\nand analyze the most comprehensive atlas of FSL data to date. We explore their\nempirical correlations (paper I), compare them with photoionization models that\ncover multiphase gas (paper II), and discuss their physical origins and the new\nperspectives they offer for studying physical properties (paper III). The first\npaper introduces value-added catalogs of global FSL data of low- and high-z\ngalaxies compiled from the literature, covering most of the existing\nobservations, supplemented with ancillary ultraviolet to FIR information. Our\nanalysis focus on commonly used diagnostics, such as electron density,\nradiation field strength, metallicity, and electron temperature. We present\ntheir distributions across different galaxy samples and redshifts, and\ncross-validate the reliability of these diagnostics in measuring physical\nconditions. By examining empirical relations, we identify the contribution of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) to the FIR FSLs [O III]88 and [O I]63, and reveal\na bias in density measurements. FIR FSLs show good concordance with their\noptical counterparts. Our findings indicate that variations in FSL ratios are\nprimarily driven by the relative abundances of emitting ions, underscoring\ntheir value as tracers of metallicity and radiation field strength. Finally, we\ncompare the FIR FSL properties of low- and high-z galaxies, discussing both\ntheir similarities and differences.",

Otherwise, the states are locally distinguishable.\nHowever, locally indistinguishable states may find applications in information\nprocessing protocols. In this sense, locally indistinguishable states are\nuseful. On the other hand, it is usual to consider that locally distinguishable\nstates are useless. Nevertheless, recent works suggest that locally\ndistinguishable states should be given due consideration as in certain\nsituations these states can be converted to locally indistinguishable states\nunder orthogonality-preserving LOCC (OP-LOCC). Such a counterintuitive\nphenomenon motivates us to ask when the aforesaid conversion is possible and\nwhen it is not. In this work, we provide different structures of locally\ndistinguishable product and entangled states which do not allow the aforesaid\nconversion. We also provide certain structures of locally distinguishable\nstates which allow the aforesaid conversion. In this way, we classify the\nlocally distinguishable sets by introducing hierarchies among them. In a\nmultipartite system, this study becomes more involved as there exist\nmultipartite locally distinguishable sets which cannot be converted to locally\nindistinguishable sets by OP-LOCC across any bipartition.

This forms the basis for a\ntopological classification of the local causal structure in terms of the number\nof connected spacelike and timelike regions on the triangulated 2-sphere\nsurrounding the vertex. These local causal data allow us to identify regular\ncausal structures and new types of causal irregular configurations,\ngeneralizing well-known (1+1)-dimensional topologies, such as `Trousers' and\n`Yarmulkes', to higher dimensions.\n  We further investigate the dynamical implications of vertex causality by\nanalyzing the behaviour of deficit angles and the Regge action in explicit\nconfigurations. Transitions in vertex causal structure coincide with\nsingularities in the curvature and action, suggesting discrete topology change.\nCausally irregular hinges correspond to discrete conical singularities, while\nvertex causal irregularities manifest as point-like singularities.\nInterestingly, we find that vertex and hinge causality are generally\nindependent.

We then\nperform a numerical investigation of the natural super-orbitals corresponding\nto both the time-evolution operator and a time-evolved local operator, focusing\non two many-body systems: the fermionic $t\\text{-}V$ chain and an impurity\nmodel, using tensor network simulations. Our results reveal that the\n$t\\text{-}V$ model lacks a preferred super-orbital basis, while in the impurity\nmodel, the occupations of the natural orbitals for both operators decay\nexponentially at all times. This indicates that only a small number of orbitals\ncontribute significantly to quantum correlations, enabling a compact\nmatrix-product-operator representation and a reduced non-stabilizerness in the\nnatural orbital basis. Finally, we examine the spatial spread of the natural\norbitals for time-evolved local operators in the impurity model and show that\nthe complexity of this operator in the natural orbital basis saturates over\ntime. This new framework opens the door to future research that leverages the\ncompressed structure of operators in their natural super-orbital basis,\nenabling for instance the computation of out-of-time-order correlators in large\ninteracting systems over extended time scales.",

To address\nthese limitations, we propose CWNet (Causal Wavelet Network), a novel\narchitecture that leverages wavelet transforms for causal reasoning.\nSpecifically, our approach comprises two key components: 1) Inspired by the\nconcept of intervention in causality, we adopt a causal reasoning perspective\nto reveal the underlying causal relationships in low-light enhancement. From a\nglobal perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal\nembeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal\nconfounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the\nlocal level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely\nmaintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present\na wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the\nrecovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the\nspecific attributes of wavelet transforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat CWNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across\nmultiple datasets, showcasing its robust performance across diverse scenes.\nCode is available at https://github.com/bywlzts/CWNet-Causal-Wavelet-Network.",

To quantify magic, we use the\nStabilizer R\\'enyi Entropy (SRE), which we compute numerically via a perfect\nsampling algorithm. We show that although the SRE remains extensive as the\nsystem transitions from a critical phase to an area-law (disentangled) phase,\nthe structure of magic itself undergoes a delocalization phase transition. This\ntransition is characterized using the bipartite stabilizer mutual information,\nwhich exhibits the same scaling behavior as entanglement entropy: logarithmic\nscaling in the critical phase and a finite constant in the area-law phase.\nAdditionally, we explore the dynamics of SRE. While the total SRE becomes\nextensive in $O(1)$ time, we find that in the critical phase, the relaxation\ntime to the steady-state value is parameterically longer than that in generic\nrandom circuits. The relaxation follows a universal form, with a relaxation\ntime that grows linearly with the system size, providing further evidence for\nthe critical nature of the phase.",

Remarkably, signatures of\nquantum criticality persist over an exceptionally broad range of magnetic\nfields and are well described by the formation of a quantum Griffiths phase, a\nregime in which rare spatially extended regions develop local order within a\nglobally disordered phase. This leads to a quantum phase transition governed by\nan infinite-randomness fixed point and characterized by ultraslow relaxation\ndynamics. Near the quantum critical region, transport measurements reveal\nstrongly nonlinear electrical behavior, including a current-driven reentrant\ntransition from insulating to superconducting transport, providing direct\nevidence of local superconducting order. By tilting the magnetic field, we are\nable to collapse the broad Griffiths regime into a single quantum critical\npoint, QCP, demonstrating a striking level of control over disorder induced\nquantum dynamics.

If\nthey originate from neutron stars (NSs), the existence of such ultra-long\nperiod pulsars (ULPs) challenges our current understanding of NS evolution and\nemission. In this work, we propose a new channel for disk formation based on\nNSs born in close binaries with main-sequence companion stars. Using a\nhydrodynamic simulation of supernova-companion interactions, we show that a\nnewborn NS may gravitationally capture gas as it moves through the complex\ndensity field shaped by the explosion. For a binary separation of\n$20\\rm~R_\\odot$ and a companion mass of $4\\rm~M_\\odot$, we find the occurrence\nfraction for disk formation around unbound NSs to be $\\sim10\\%$. By modeling\nthe disk evolution and its interaction with the NS, we find a bimodal\ndistribution in spin periods: canonical pulsars with $P\\lesssim10\\rm\\,s$ are\nthe ones who lack disks or whose magnetospheres never interacted with the disk,\nand ULPs with $10^3\\lesssim P<10^5\\rm\\,s$ are produced when the system\nundergoes a short-lived ``propeller'' phase during which the NS undergoes rapid\nspin-down. Such ULPs are formed under strong initial dipolar magnetic field\nstrengths $B_0\\gtrsim10^{14}\\rm\\,G$, with a formation rate of\n$10^{-4}\\rm\\,yr^{-1}$ in the Milky Way. We also find that a small population of\npulsars with moderate magnetic field strengths\n($10^{13}\\lesssim~B_0\\lesssim10^{14}\\rm\\,G$) and relatively slow initial\nperiods ($P_0\\gtrsim0.1\\rm\\,s$) evolve to $P\\sim10^2\\rm\\,s$, filling the gap\nbetween the bimodal distribution. Thus, our model provides a unified\nexplanation for pulsars beyond the ``death line.''",

Using a new empirical scaling linking the [Ne v] line\nemission with AGN accretion-driven (continuum) emission, derived from a highly\ncomplete low-redshift AGN sample, we show that the [Ne v] emission in the two z\n> 5 galaxies implies total (bolometric) AGN luminosities of order\nL_bol~(4-8)x10^45 erg/s. Assuming that the radiation emitted from these systems\nis Eddington limited, the (minimal) black hole masses are of order M_BH>10^7\nM_sun. Combined with the published stellar masses of the galaxies, estimated\nfrom dedicated fitting of their spectral energy distributions, the implied\nBH-to-stellar mass ratios are of order M_BH/M_host~0.1-1. This is considerably\nhigher than what is found in the local Universe, but is consistent with the\ngeneral trend seen in some other z > 5 AGN.

At\nintermediate redshift, quiescent galaxies at all stellar masses show a\nsystematic decline in $R_{e,c}$ and rise in $n$ with rest-frame wavelength.\nThese structural variations are stronger for galaxies that recently joined the\nquiescent population (newcomers) than for the descendants of galaxies that are\nalready quiescent at the survey limit, $z \\sim 0.6$ (aging population). The\ncombined evidence supports inside-out quenching as the dominant mechanism\nhalting star formation during this epoch.

In addition to the traditional AGN feedback modes, negative\n(suppressing cooling), and the new positive mode (triggering star formation),\nwe introduce two implementations of a third mode: the ejection of hot gas\nbeyond the virial radius, AGNeject1 and AGNeject2. This component addresses a\nlongstanding issue in semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations: the\noverestimation of hot gas fractions in low and intermediate mass halos. FEGA25\nis calibrated via MCMC using a suite of cosmological N-body simulations YS50HR,\nYS200, and YS300, and a comprehensive set of observed stellar mass functions\nacross a wide redshift range. We find that supernova feedback dominates gas\nejection in halos with logM_{halo} < approximately 12, while AGN feedback\nbecomes increasingly important at higher halo masses. The AGNeject2 model,\nwhich activates primarily at late times, redshift < 1, reproduces a\ncharacteristic cavity, a U shaped feature in the baryon fraction at redshift\nzero, similar to trends observed in simulations like SIMBA and IllustrisTNG.\nConversely, AGNeject1 yields a smoother, redshift independent evolution. Both\nmodels preserve the stellar and cold gas components and successfully reproduce\nthe stellar to halo mass relation up to redshift 3.

Local\nmonitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target\nsite, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of\nthe evolution time.

Specifically, for any such map, we propose a\nmethod to find an effective topologically-conjugate map which reproduces the\nrare-event statistics in the long-time limit. We demonstrate the applicability\nof this result using several observables of paradigmatic examples of\ntwo-dimensional chaos, namely the two-dimensional tent map and Arnold's cat\nmap.",

    "abstract": "Observations of the hydrogen hyperfine transition through the 21 cm line near\nthe end of the cosmic dark ages provide unique opportunities to probe new\nphysics. In this work, we investigate the potential of the sky-averaged 21 cm\nsignal to constrain metastable particles produced in the early universe that\ndecay at later times, thereby modifying the thermal and ionization history of\nthe intergalactic medium. The study begins by extending previous analyses of\ndecaying dark matter (DM), incorporating back-reaction effects and tightening\nphoton decay constraints down to DM masses as low as 20.4 eV. The focus then\nshifts to non-minimal dark sectors with multiple interacting components. The\nanalysis covers two key scenarios: a hybrid setup comprising a stable cold DM\ncomponent alongside a metastable sub-component, and a two-component dark sector\nof nearly degenerate states with a metastable heavier partner. A general\nparameterization based on effective mass spectra and fractional densities\nallows for a model-independent study. The final part presents two explicit\nrealizations: an axion-like particle coupled to photons, and pseudo-Dirac DM\ninteracting via vector portals or electromagnetic dipoles. These scenarios\nillustrate how 21 cm cosmology can set leading bounds and probe otherwise\ninaccessible regions of parameter space.",

Using $N$-body simulations, we find that the planet could be\ndynamically stable at a mutual angle inclination up to $\\sim75^\\circ$. The von\nZeipel-Lidov-Kozai (vZLK) mechanism becomes active when the mutual inclination\nis greater than 39.2$^\\circ$. High-inclination orbits exhibit coupled\noscillations in eccentricity and inclination, along with apsidal precession.\nSynthetic radial velocity (RV) modeling shows that these secular variations\nproduce measurable signatures across a broad range of timescales, from full\nvZLK cycles to observationally accessible decades. For instance, a high mutual\ninclination at 75$^\\circ$ can induce RV drifts exceeding 5 m s$^{-1}$ per\nplanetary orbit ($\\sim 1.9 \\,\\text{m s}^{-1}\\, \\text{yr}^{-1}$) in circular\nbinary configurations. The presence of eccentric vZLK further accelerates these\ndrifts, enhancing the detectability. Long-term RV observations of this system\noffer a unique pathway to dynamically constrain the orbital inclination, and\nthus determine the true mass of HD 41004 Ab. The degeneracy of mass-inclination\nis well known when using RV measurements alone. Our results highlight that HD\n41004Ab and potentially other S-type planets in compact binaries are promising\ntargets for breaking such a degeneracy by studying the dynamics induced by the\nvZLK mechanism through long-term high-precision RV monitoring.",

In a number of instances, however,\nthe exact nature of the corresponding ground states remains the subject of\nongoing debate. We show that general symmetry considerations can rule out\ncandidate states that are incompatible with the observed ferrimagnetic\nbehavior. In particular, we demonstrate that a ferrimagnetic response cannot be\nreconciled with a collinear zigzag ground state, owing to the combined\ntime-reversal and translational symmetry inherent to that configuration.\nInstead, the observed behavior is fully compatible with the symmetries of\nnoncollinear multi-$\\mathbf q$ states, such as the triple-$\\mathbf q$ discussed\nin the context of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. We exemplify this general result by\ncomputing the ferrimagnetic response of an extended Heisenberg-Kitaev-Gamma\nmodel with explicit sublattice symmetry breaking within linear spin-wave\ntheory. If the model realizes a triple-$\\mathbf q$ ground state, the calculated\nmagnetization curve is well consistent with the low-temperature behavior\nobserved in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. In this case, a finite magnetization remains\nin the zero-temperature limit as a consequence of quantum fluctuations, even if\nthe $g$-factors on the different sublattices are identical. For a zigzag ground\nstate, by contrast, the total magnetization vanishes both at zero and finite\ntemperatures, independent of possible sublattice-dependent $g$-factors, as\nexpected from the symmetry analysis.

In the limit of no bulk entanglement, the holographic encoding breaks\ndown. The oft-cited one-dimensional nature of the closed universe Hilbert space\nrepresents the limitation of the external (CFT) Hilbert space to access the\nquantum information in the closed universe, similar to the limitations imposed\non observers outside a perfectly isolated quantum lab. We advocate that the CFT\nnevertheless continues to determine the physical properties of the closed\nuniverse in this regime, showing how to interpret this relationship in terms of\na final state projection in the closed universe. We provide a dictionary\nbetween the final state wavefunction and CFT data. We propose a model of the\nemergence of an arrow of time in the universe with a given initial or final\nstate projection. Finally, we show that the conventional EFT in the closed\nuniverse, without any projection, can be recovered as a maximally ignorant\ndescription of the final state. This conventional EFT is encoded in CFT data,\nand it can be probed by computing coarse-grained observables. We provide an\nexample of one such observable.

The high resolution enables an\nextended inertial range such that the Alfv\\'en scale $l_A$, where $\\delta B\n(l_A)\\approx B_0$, is well resolved. This allows us to properly capture how the\ncascade transitions from large amplitudes on large scales to small amplitudes\non small scales. We find that sharp bends in the magnetic field are key\nmediators of particle transport even on small scales via resonant curvature\nscattering. We further find that particle scattering in the turbulence shows\nstrong hints of self-similarity: (1) the diffusion has weak energy dependence\nover almost two decades in particle energy and (2) the particles' random walk\nexhibits a broad power-law distribution of collision times such that the\ndiffusion is dominated by the rarest, long-distance excursions. Our results\nsuggest that large-amplitude MHD turbulence can provide efficient scattering\nover a wide range of CR energies and may help explain many CR observations\nabove a $\\sim$TeV: the flattening of the B/C spectrum, the hardening of CR\nprimary spectra and the weak dependence of arrival anisotropy on CR energy.",

However, conventional methods for constructing merger trees rely on\nad-hoc assumptions and are unable to incorporate environmental information.\nNguyen et al. (2024) introduced FLORAH, a generative model based on recurrent\nneural networks and normalizing flows, for modeling main progenitor branches of\nmerger trees. In this work, we extend this model, now referred to as\nFLORAH-Tree, to generate complete merger trees by representing them as graph\nstructures that capture the full branching hierarchy. We trained FLORAH-Tree on\nmerger trees extracted from the Very Small MultiDark Planck cosmological N-body\nsimulation. To validate our approach, we compared the generated merger trees\nwith both the original simulation data and with semi-analytic trees produced\nusing the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism. We show that FLORAH-Tree\naccurately reproduces key merger rate statistics across a wide range of mass\nand redshift, outperforming the conventional EPS-based approach. We demonstrate\nits utility by applying the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model (SAM) to generated\ntrees and showing that the resulting galaxy-halo scaling relations, such as the\nstellar-to-halo-mass relation and supermassive black hole mass-halo mass\nrelation, closely match those from applying the SAM to trees extracted directly\nfrom the simulation. FLORAH-Tree provides a computationally efficient method\nfor generating merger trees that maintain the statistical fidelity of N-body\nsimulations.",

In such systems\nobjects execute planar orbits covering two-dimensional rings or annuli,\nrepresented by the angular-momentum vectors, which slowly reorient due to the\npersistent weak gravitational interaction between different rings. This\nprocess, called vector resonant relaxation, is much faster than other processes\nwhich change the size/shape of the rings. The interaction is stron9gest between\nobjects with closely aligned angular-momentum vectors. In this paper, we show\nthat nearly parallel angular-momentum vectors may form stable bound pairs in\nangular-momentum space. We examine the stability of such pairs against an\nexternal massive perturber, and determine the critical separation analogous to\nthe Hill radius or tidal radius in the three-body problem, where the\nangular-momentum pairs are marginally disrupted, as a function of the\nperturber's mass, the orbital inclination, and the radial distance.\nAngular-momentum pairs or multiples closer than the critical inclination will\nremain bound and evolve together in angular-momentum-direction space under any\nexternal influence, such as anisotropic density fluctuations, or massive\nperturbers. This study has applications in various astrophysical contexts,\nincluding galactic nuclei, in particular the Milky Way's Galactic centre,\nglobular clusters, or planetary systems. In nuclear star clusters with a\ncentral super-massive black hole, we apply this criterion to the disc of young,\nmassive stars, and show that clusters in angular-momentum space may be used to\nconstrain the presence of intermediate-mass black holes or the mass of the\nnearby gaseous torus.",

While star formation can be traced at 10\nMyr time-scales through H$\\alpha$ emission, the signature of OB stars, and at\n100 Myr scale with UV emission, the gas surface density is traced by HI\nemission for the atomic phase. We choose to investigate feedback processes\nusing fountain effects in M101, a nearby well-observed face-on galaxy. Face-on\nstudies are very complementary to the more frequent edge-on observations of\nthese fountains in the literature. We use high-resolution data from THINGS for\nthe HI emission GALEX for UV, and SITELLE/SIGNALS IFU for the H$\\alpha$ tracer.\nWe have identified 20 new HI holes, in addition to the 52 holes found by\nKamphuis in 1993. We study in more detail the nine holes satisfying strong\ncriteria to be true fountain effects, compute their physical properties, and\nderive their energy balance. Only one small HI hole still contains H$\\alpha$\nand young stars inside, while the largest hole of 2.4 kpc and oldest age (94\nMyr) is deprived of H$\\alpha$ and UV. For face-on disks, the possibility to\nstudy simultaneously the HI shell morphology, the stellar association, and\nkinematic evidence is of primordial importance.

However, recent studies of star-forming galaxies at cosmic\nnoon have shown a decline in their rotation curve beyond a certain point,\nsuggesting a decrease of the abundance of dark matter in galactic halos during\nearlier times. In this work, we investigate the influence of cosmological\nsurface brightness dimming and loss of resolution on observations of rotation\ncurves at cosmic noon. We used a sample of 19 Lyman Break Analogs at $z \\approx\n0.2$ and artificially redshifted them as if they were at $z \\approx 2.2$. By\ncomparing both rotation curves of the observed and mocked objects, we find that\nthe asymmetry of the cosmic noon galaxies is smaller than that of the low-$z$\ngalaxies. In low-$z$ galaxies, asymmetry increases with radius and becomes\nrelevant at the external parts, where mergers and interactions cause more\ndisturbance in the galaxy's gravitational field. In contrast, cosmic-noon\ngalaxies appear smoother, smaller, and suitable for dynamical modeling -- when\nin reality, they are not. The combined effects of the cosmological bias and\nloss of resolution lead us to the conclusion that caution should be exercised\nwhen using cosmic-noon rotation curves, as they might not accurately trace the\ngravitational potential of the galaxy.",

Existing benchmarks predominantly assess\nsingle-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical\nlimitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging\n(e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly creation of new\nquestions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate models under\nmulti-context pressure, a key requirement for real-world deployment. To bridge\nthis gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through Simultaneous Testing),\na stress-testing framework that exposes LRMs to multiple problems\nsimultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST evaluates several under-tested\ncapabilities: contextual priority allocation, cross-problem interference\nresistance, and dynamic cognitive load management. Our evaluation reveals\nseveral striking findings: Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1\nexhibit substantial performance degradation under stress testing. Crucially,\nREST demonstrates stronger discriminative power than existing benchmarks,\nrevealing pronounced performance differences among models that exhibit similar,\nnear-ceiling performance under single-question evaluations. Some key insights\nemerge from our analysis: (1) the \"overthinking trap\" is a critical factor\ncontributing to the performance degradation; (2) the models trained with\n\"long2short\" technique preserve more accuracy of their single-problem\nperformance under REST, outperforming standard-trained counterparts. These\nresults establish REST as a cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm\nthat better reflects real-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on\ncontinuous human annotation.

We highlight an underexploited opportunity: LLM routing\ndata, produced when hosting platforms route diverse queries to different\nmodels, which can reveal comparative strengths across tasks. To address this,\nwe propose FusionBench, a comprehensive routing benchmark covering 14 tasks\nacross five domains with 20 open-source LLMs (8B to 671B parameters), capturing\n103M tokens and summarizing reusable thought templates from top models.\nBuilding on this, we introduce FusionFactory, a systematic fusion framework\nwith three levels: (1) query-level fusion, tailoring routers for each query\nusing both direct responses and reasoning-augmented outputs; (2) thought-level\nfusion, leveraging abstract templates derived from top-performing LLMs' answers\nto similar queries; and (3) model-level fusion, transferring capabilities\nbetween models via distillation, using top responses or highest judge scores as\ntraining data.

Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also\nserve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by\nother models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking\ndifferent LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.\nHowever, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its\neffectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of\ndedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and\nunit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform\nnon-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even\nrelatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially\ntrained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still\nexhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise\njudging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can\nsubstantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests\nwritten by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in\nperformance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and\nconsistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal\nprompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise\ncomparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining\ncomments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved\njudge performance.",

As the climate warms, extreme events such as\nheatwaves, droughts, and wildfires have become more frequent and are projected\nto intensify throughout the 21st century. These escalating extremes are likely\nto further disrupt vegetation productivity, known as gross primary production\n(GPP), and reduce the ecosystem's capacity to absorb carbon. In this study, we\nemploy a global Earth system model to assess how (a) CO2 emissions alone and\n(b) CO2 combined with LULCC influence the severity, frequency, and duration of\nGPP extremes. Our results show that negative GPP extremes periods of\nunexpectedly low carbon uptake are increasing more rapidly than positive\nextremes, especially under LULCC scenarios. The primary climate factor driving\nthese extremes is soil moisture variability, which is influenced by\nfluctuations in both precipitation and temperature. The delayed responses of\nGPP to different climate drivers depend on the specific driver and geographical\nregion. Overall, the highest incidence of GPP extremes arises from the combined\ninfluence of water stress, temperature anomalies, and fire-related\ndisturbances.",

    ],
    "abstract": "The Tolman effect is well-known in relativistic cosmology but rarely\ndiscussed outside it. That is surprising because the effect -- that systems\nextended over a varying gravitational potential exhibit temperature gradients\nwhile in thermal equilibrium -- conflicts with ordinary classical\nthermodynamics. In this paper we try to better understand this effect from a\nfoundational perspective. We make five claims. First, as Tolman knew, it was\nEinstein who first discovered the effect, and furthermore, Einstein's\nderivation helps us appreciate how robust it is. Second, the standard\ninterpretation of the effect in terms of 'local temperature' leads to the\nbreakdown of much of classical thermodynamics. Third, one can rescue\nthermodynamics by using Einstein's preferred interpretation in terms of the\n'wahre Temperatur' -- what we'll call global temperature -- but it too has some\ncosts. Fourth, the effect is perhaps best understood in terms of clocks as\nopposed to energy loss. Fifth, inspired by a proposal of Einstein's elsewhere,\nwe sketch an interpretation of the effect in terms of a third novel\ntemperature, which we call the 'wahre-local temperature'. On this view,\ntemperature -- and thermodynamics -- is defined only in relation to local\nclocks. In sum, we view the fragmentation of temperature in thermodynamics as a\nnatural and expected result of the fragmentation of time in general relativity.",

Several quick\nresponse observations suggest the lunar ejecta origin of 2024 PT$_5$, while\nrotation state and albedo, essential properties to investigate its origin, are\nnot well constrained. We performed visible to near-infrared multicolor\nphotometry of 2024 PT$_5$ from data taken using the TriColor CMOS Camera and\nSpectrograph (TriCCS) on the Seimei 3.8 m telescope during 2025 January 4-10.\nThe Seimei/TriCCS observations of 2024 PT$_5$ cover phase angles from 14 deg to\n27 deg, and were obtained in the $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands in the Pan-STARRS\nsystem. In addition, we analyzed $Y$, $J$, $H$, and $K$ photometry taken with\nthe Multi-Object Spectrograph for Infrared Exploration (MOSFIRE) on the Keck I\n10-m telescope taken on 2025 January 16-17. Our lightcurves show brightness\nvariations over time periods of several tens of minutes. We infer that 2024\nPT$_5$ is in a tumbling state and has a lightcurve amplitude of about 0.3 mag.\nVisible and near-infrared color indices of 2024 PT$_5$, $g-r=0.567\\pm0.044$,\n$r-i=0.155\\pm0.009$, $r-z=0.147\\pm0.066$, $Y-J=0.557\\pm0.046$,\n$J-H=0.672\\pm0.078$, and $H-Ks=0.148\\pm0.098$, indicate that 2024 PT$_5$ is an\nS-complex asteroid, largely consistent with previous observations. Using the\n$H$-$G$ model, we derived an absolute magnitude $H_{V,HG}$ of $27.72\\pm0.09$\nand a slope parameter $G_V$ of $0.223\\pm0.073$ in V-band. A geometric albedo of\n2024 PT$_5$ is derived to be $0.26\\pm0.07$ from the slope of its photometric\nphase curve. This albedo value is typical of the S- and Q-type NEAs.

We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework\nthat combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.\nMoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter\nefficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by\ndynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This\nallows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still\nactive at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency\nby selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core\nmechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the\nfirst recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory\nfootprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms\na new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it\nsignificantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,\nwhile delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive\nbaselines.

The energy extraction process in the plunging region was further\nexamined by analyzing the permissible energy extraction region, as well as the\ncorresponding power output and efficiency. One can find that the energy\nextraction is possible even at a spin as low as 0.25. Crucially, parameter $b$\nactively lowers the energy extraction spin threshold, while parameter $l$\nexerts a counteracting effect, impeding such reduction.

These singular points,\ncharacterized by cubic contact of vector field $X$ and quadratic contact of\nvector field $Y$ on the switching manifold, are structurally unstable under\nsmall perturbations of $Z$, giving rise to significant bifurcation phenomena.\n  We analyze the bifurcations of a 3D Filippov system around an invisible\ncusp-fold singularity, providing a detailed characterization of its crossing\ndynamics under certain conditions. We classify the characteristics of the\nsingularity when it emerges generically in one-parameter families (a\ncodimension-one phenomenon), and we show that no crossing limit cycles (CLCs)\nlocally bifurcate from it in this particular scenario. When the vector fields\n$X$ and $Y$ are anti-collinear at the cusp-fold singularity, we provide\nconditions for the generic emergence of this point in two-parameter families (a\ncodimension-two phenomenon). In this case, we show that the unfolding of such a\nsingularity leads to a bifurcating CLC, which degenerates into a fold-regular\npolycycle (self-connection at a fold-regular singularity).\n  Furthermore, we numerically derive the polycycle bifurcation curve and\ncomplete the two-parameter bifurcation set for a boost converter system\npreviously studied in the literature.

For example, two common approaches to\nundergraduate QM instruction are spins-first, which focuses on the postulates\nof QM in spin systems before discussing wavefunctions, and wavefunctions-first,\nwhich focuses on the Schr\\\"odinger equation and its solutions for continuous\nfunctions in various potentials before discussing spin. These different\napproaches, along with the content variability in the textbooks used by\ninstructors, may mean students learn different things in QM classes across the\nUnited States (U.S.). In this paper, we offer a characterization of QM courses\nbased on survey responses from instructors at institutions across the U.S. With\nthe responses of 76 instructors teaching QM courses (or sequences), we present\nresults detailing their teaching methodologies, use of pedagogical resources,\nand coverage of QM topics. We find that the plurality of instructors in our\nsample are using traditional lecture, but many instructors are using\ninteractive lecture or another non-traditional method. Additionally,\ninstructors are using a wide variety of pedagogical tools (e.g., clicker\nquestions). Many instructors in our sample reported teaching single-semester\n(or single-quarter) QM courses; these instructors report similar content\ncoverage to instructors teaching first-semester (or quarter) QM courses, though\ntheir responses showed greater variability. We additionally report a comparison\nof content coverage between instructors using wavefunctions-first versus\nspins-first approaches, finding a large degree of overlap with differences in\ncoverage for a few specific topics.

In this paper, we consider estimation and inference for a\nnonparametric class of real-valued c\\`adl\\`ag functions with bounded sectional\nvariation (Gill et al., 1995), using the Highly Adaptive Lasso (HAL) (van der\nLaan, 2015; Benkeser and van der Laan, 2016; van der Laan, 2023), a flexible\nempirical risk minimizer over linear combinations of tensor products of zero-\nor higher-order spline basis functions under an L1 norm constraint. Building on\nrecent theoretical advances in asymptotic normality and uniform convergence\nrates for higher-order spline HAL estimators (van der Laan, 2023), this work\nfocuses on constructing robust confidence intervals for HAL-based conditional\nmean estimators. To address regularization bias, we propose a targeted HAL with\na debiasing step to remove bias for the conditional mean, and also consider a\nrelaxed HAL estimator to reduce bias. We also introduce both global and local\nundersmoothing strategies to adaptively select the working model, reducing bias\nrelative to variance. Combined with delta-method-based variance estimation, we\nconstruct confidence intervals for conditional means based on HAL. Through\nsimulations, we evaluate combinations of estimation and model selection\nstrategies, showing that our methods substantially reduce bias and yield\nconfidence intervals with coverage rates close to nominal levels across\nscenarios. We also provide recommendations for different estimation objectives\nand illustrate the generality of our framework by applying it to estimate\nconditional average treatment effect (CATE) functions, highlighting how\nHAL-based inference extends to other infinite-dimensional, non-pathwise\ndifferentiable parameters.",

We propose LaSDI-IT (Latent Space\nDynamics Identification for Interface Tracking), a data-driven framework that\ncombines low-dimensional latent dynamics learning with explicit interface-aware\nencoding to enable accurate and efficient modeling of physical systems\ninvolving moving material boundaries. At the core of LaSDI-IT is a revised\nauto-encoder architecture that jointly reconstructs the physical field and an\nindicator function representing material regions or phases, allowing the model\nto track complex interface evolution without requiring detailed physical models\nor mesh adaptation. The latent dynamics are learned through linear regression\nin the encoded space and generalized across parameter regimes using Gaussian\nprocess interpolation with greedy sampling. We demonstrate LaSDI-IT on the\nproblem of shock-induced pore collapse in high explosives, a process\ncharacterized by sharp temperature gradients and dynamically deforming pore\ngeometries. The method achieves relative prediction errors below 9% across the\nparameter space, accurately recovers key quantities of interest such as pore\narea and hot spot formation, and matches the performance of dense training with\nonly half the data.

The\ndecreasing density causes their amplitude to increase, developing into\nnonlinear waves through steepening and eventually forming shocks. To\ninvestigate the vertical evolution of this wave nonlinearity, we utilized\nmulti-wavelength data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), covering from the photosphere to the lower\ncorona across 20 active regions. The steepening of the wave profile leads to\nthe generation of higher harmonics. We quantify this using a nonlinearity index\n(NI), defined as the ratio of the amplitude of 2nd harmonic to the fundamental\nobtained using wavelet analysis. We find a characteristic pattern: nonlinearity\nincreases from the photosphere through the lower chromosphere, peaking near the\nAIA 1700 \\r{A} formation height, and decreases at higher altitudes, notably in\nthe AIA 304 \\r{A} channel. This trend indicates progressive wave steepening and\nsubsequent energy dissipation before reaching the formation of AIA 304 \\r{A},\nconsistent with shock formation in the lower atmosphere. An additional rise in\nNI is observed at the AIA 131 \\r{A} channel, followed by a decline in AIA 171\n\\r{A}, suggesting a 2nd phase of wave nonlinearity evolution in the lower\ncorona. Based on the NI profile and the formation heights of these channels, we\nconjecture that nonlinear wave processes are most prominent between the AIA\n1700 \\r{A} and AIA 304 \\r{A} formation layers and again between AIA 131 \\r{A}\nand AIA 171 \\r{A}.",

However, existing unlearning\nmethods mainly focus on recovering trigger patterns but fail to restore the\ncorrect semantic labels of poison samples. This limitation prevents them from\nfully eliminating the false correlation between the trigger pattern and the\ntarget label. To address this, we leverage boundary adversarial attack\ntechniques, revealing two key observations. First, poison samples exhibit\nsignificantly greater distances from decision boundaries compared to clean\nsamples, indicating they require larger adversarial perturbations to change\ntheir predictions. Second, while adversarial predicted labels for clean samples\nare uniformly distributed, those for poison samples tend to revert to their\noriginal correct labels. Moreover, the features of poison samples restore to\nclosely resemble those of corresponding clean samples after adding adversarial\nperturbations. Building upon these insights, we propose Backdoor Unlearning via\nadversaRial bouNdary analysis (BURN), a novel defense framework that integrates\nfalse correlation decoupling, progressive data refinement, and model\npurification. In the first phase, BURN employs adversarial boundary analysis to\ndetect poisoned samples based on their abnormal adversarial boundary distances,\nthen restores their correct semantic labels for fine-tuning. In the second\nphase, it employs a feedback mechanism that tracks prediction discrepancies\nbetween the original backdoored model and progressively sanitized models,\nguiding both dataset refinement and model purification.

We propose a confidence-based self-distillation approach that\noutperforms state-of-the-art models by utilizing only previous iteration data\nstorage during training, without requiring extra computation or memory usage\nduring testing. Our approach calculates the loss between the previous and\ncurrent iterations within a batch using a dynamic confidence coefficient. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on the task of polyp segmentation. Our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models and generalizes well across datasets collected from\nmultiple clinical centers. The code will be released to the public once the\npaper is accepted.",

In this paper, we demonstrate how SynthGuard addresses\nthe complexities at the intersection of domain-specific needs and scalable SDG\nby aligning with requirements for data sovereignty and regulatory compliance.\nDeveloped iteratively with domain expert input, SynthGuard has been validated\nthrough real-world use cases, demonstrating its ability to balance security,\nprivacy, and scalability while ensuring compliance.

To bridge this gap, we develop\na predictive analysis of coupling by applying a renormalization group (RG)\nanalysis to an effective Hamiltonian for the stochastic dynamics of the\nplasma-surface interface, derived systematically from microscopic principles.\nThe central result from this formalism is the system's exhibition of asymptotic\nfreedom; the effective dimensionless coupling, $g$, between the plasma and the\ngrowing surface is found to weaken systematically at macroscopic length scales,\na finding that provides a rigorous justification for the success of\ncontinuum-level models in describing large-scale film evolution. The RG\nframework yields a non-perturbative scaling relation for the mean grain area,\n$\\langle A \\rangle \\propto \\exp(\\kappa/g)$, where $g$ itself is defined by\nfundamental parameters such as ion flux ($\\Phi$) and ion collision time\n($\\tau_{\\text{ion}}$). This relation reveals the origin of widely-observed\nempirical power-law scaling, showing it to be an effective behavior limited to\nspecific process regimes. Crucially, the model furnishes sharp, testable\npredictions, including the pressure-independence of grain size within\ncollision-dominated plasmas and a parameter-free criterion, $\\Lambda_c =\n1/(n^2-1)$, for the onset of morphological instability and faceting based on\ncrystal symmetry.

    "abstract": "Aircraft aerodynamic design optimization must account for the varying\noperating conditions along the cruise segment as opposed to designing at one\nfixed operating condition, to arrive at more realistic designs. Conventional\napproaches address this by performing a ``multi-point'' optimization that\nassumes a weighted average of the objectives at a set of sub-segments along the\ncruise segment. We argue that since such multi-point approaches are,\ninevitably, biased by the specification of the weights, they can lead to\nsub-optimal designs. Instead, we propose to optimize the aircraft design at\nmultiple sub-segments simultaneously -- that is, via multiobjective\noptimization that leads to a set of Pareto optimal solutions. However, existing\nwork in multiobjective optimization suffers from (i) lack of sample efficiency\n(that is, keeping the number of function evaluations to convergence minimal),\n(ii) scalability with input dimensions and number of objectives, and (iii) the\nability to generate a batch of iterates for synchronous parallel evaluations.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multiobjective Bayesian\noptimization methodology that demonstrates improved sample efficiency and\naccuracy compared to the state of the art. Inspired by Thompson sampling, our\napproach leverages Gaussian process surrogates and Bayesian decision theory to\ngenerate a sequence of iterates according to the probability that they are\nPareto optimal. Our approach, named batch Pareto optimal Thompson sampling\n($q\\texttt{POTS}$), demonstrates superior empirical performance on a variety of\nsynthetic experiments as well as a $24$ dimensional two-objective aerodynamic\ndesign optimization of the NASA common research model.

    "abstract": "The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in\nolder adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can\ngreatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely\nintervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective\nand reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this\nwork, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary\nsystems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system\n(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human\nfall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall\nscenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor\nlocalization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a\nrobot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an\nedge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen\npeople. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different\naccuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to\n99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%\naccuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the\naccuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework\ncreates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall\naccuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults,\nbut it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.",

However, these visual cues significantly\ndepend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to\ngeo-localization.

In this\npaper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from\nhigh-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image\nrestoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and\nreconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference\nselection (RefSel) module.

As for the transfer, due to the\ntrivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion\nparadigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.\nFinally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further\nensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle\nconsistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask.

However, research in this area is still fragmented across\ndifferent communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered\nframeworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the\nSemantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation\nobscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic\nunderstanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive\nevolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and\nthe MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations\nof earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To\nsystematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic\nfoundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery\nmechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing\nagent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent\nwhere others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift\nin the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic\nWeb) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model\n(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable\nand adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new\nprotocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,\ntrustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies\nin solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda\nfocused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance\nfor the emerging WoA.",

The colorful minor relation enhances the\nclassical minor relation by merging color sets at contracted edges and allowing\nthe removal of colors from vertices. This framework naturally models\nalgorithmic problems involving graphs with (possibly overlapping) annotated\nvertex sets. We develop a structural theory for colorful minors by establishing\nseveral theorems characterizing $\\mathcal{H}$-colorful minor-free graphs, where\n$\\mathcal{H}$ consists either of a clique or a grid with all vertices assigned\nall colors, or of grids with colors segregated and ordered on the outer face.\nLeveraging our structural insights, we provide a complete classification -\nparameterized by the number $q$ of colors - of all colorful graphs that exhibit\nthe Erd\\H{o}s-P\\'osa property with respect to colorful minors. On the\nalgorithmic side, we provide a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for colorful\nminor testing and a variant of the $k$-disjoint paths problem. Together with\nthe fact that the colorful minor relation forms a well-quasi-order, this\nimplies that every colorful minor-monotone parameter on colorful graphs admits\na fixed-parameter algorithm. Furthermore, we derive two algorithmic\nmeta-theorems (AMTs) whose structural conditions are linked to extensions of\ntreewidth and Hadwiger number on colorful graphs.

    "abstract": "Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution\npanchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to\ngenerate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the\neffectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently\nconstrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all\nspatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this\nissue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive\nconvolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive\nPansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive\nkernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of\nspatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the\nPansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an\nattention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail\nenhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly\navailable datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared\nto existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and\nqualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the\neffectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.",

The model developed in this work\nuses associative memory via a transparent, explainable Hopfield neural network\nto store signals and detect similar signals which can then be used to classify\nspecies. Training is rapid ($3$\\,ms), as only one representative signal is\nrequired for each target sound within a dataset. The model is fast, taking only\n$5.4$\\,s to pre-process and classify all $10384$ publicly available bat\nrecordings, on a standard Apple MacBook Air. The model is also lightweight with\na small memory footprint of $144.09$\\,MB of RAM usage. Hence, the low\ncomputational demands make the model ideal for use on a variety of standard\npersonal devices with potential for deployment in the field via edge-processing\ndevices. It is also competitively accurate, with up to $86\\%$ precision on the\ndataset used to evaluate the model.

We study how the entanglement structure\nand chaotic dynamics in the boundary theory are affected by the charge and\nbackreaction.

On the other hand MI and TMI show a more intricate\ndependence backreaction tends to strengthen correlations, while increasing\ncharge suppresses entanglement and makes the system more susceptible to\nscrambling. The analysis of the butterfly velocity indicates that both the\npresence of charge and the backreaction suppress the chaotic behavior of the\nsystem by reducing $v_B$.

Often, as is the\ncase of policy iteration for the continuous-time LQR problem, this rate\nvanishes for large initial conditions, resulting in a mixed globally linear /\nlocally exponential behavior. This is in sharp contrast with the discrete-time\nLQR problem, where there is global exponential convergence. That gap between CT\nand DT behaviors motivates the search for various generalized PLI-like\nconditions, and this talk will address that topic. Moreover, these\ngeneralizations are key to understanding the transient and asymptotic effects\nof errors in the estimation of the gradient, errors which might arise from\nadversarial attacks, wrong evaluation by an oracle, early stopping of a\nsimulation, inaccurate and very approximate digital twins, stochastic\ncomputations (algorithm ``reproducibility''), or learning by sampling from\nlimited data. We describe an ``input to state stability'' (ISS) analysis of\nthis issue.

    "abstract": "Coral reefs are vital yet vulnerable ecosystems that require continuous\nmonitoring to support conservation. While coral reef images provide essential\ninformation in coral monitoring, interpreting such images remains challenging\ndue to the need for domain expertise. Visual Question Answering (VQA), powered\nby Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), has great potential in user-friendly\ninteraction with coral reef images. However, applying VQA to coral imagery\ndemands a dedicated dataset that addresses two key challenges: domain-specific\nannotations and multidimensional questions. In this work, we introduce\nCoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It\ncontains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3\noceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess\necological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop\na semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine\nbiologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality.\nCoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for\nstudying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By\nevaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and\nopportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development,\nwith a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.",

We present a new corpus that\ncombines two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus -- one for\nreference and ambiguity in reference, and one for SDRT including clarifications\n-- into a single common format providing the necessary information to\nexperiment with clarifications and their relation to ambiguity. With this\ncorpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification\nquestions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We\nfind that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing\nclarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans\nand LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential\nambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce\nmore clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task\nuncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is\npredicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with\ndifferent reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase\nquestion frequency and relevancy.",

IC 2431 is a starburst system containing three tidally-distorted disk\ngalaxies. All three galaxies may have active nuclei. One galaxy is classified\nas an AGN based on its optical spectrum, a second is identified as a possible\nX-ray AGN based on the Chandra data, and the third galaxy may host a radio AGN.\nIn optical images, a prominent dust lane crosses the southern galaxy, while\nSpitzer infrared images show a dusty bridge connecting the two brightest\ngalaxies. Chandra maps reveal a massive (2 x 10^7 M(sun)) concentration of hot\ngas between these two galaxies, as well as several other knots of hot gas and\nnon-thermal emission. The unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of the hot gas in IC 2431\nis ~ 1 x 10^42 erg/s, which is enhanced by about a factor of four relative to\nthe star formation rate, compared to other star-forming galaxies. In radio\nmaps, a bright jet/ridge of radio continuum emission extends 4 kpc from one\nnucleus. We compare the properties of IC 2431 with those of other interacting\ngalaxy systems, and discuss two different scenarios that may account for the\npeculiarities of IC 2431: ram pressure stripping of the interstellar medium\nduring a head-on collision between two galaxies, or an AGN-powered radio jet\nthat has been distorted by an interaction with interstellar gas during a tidal\nencounter between galaxies.",

However, defects during growth and transfer\nto other substrates can compromise the integrity and strength of graphene.\nSurprisingly, the literature suggests that, in certain cases, defects can\nenhance or, at most, not affect the mechanical performance of graphene. Further\nresearch is necessary to explore how defects interact within graphene structure\nand affect its properties, especially in large-area samples. In this study, we\ninvestigate the interaction between two preexisting cracks and their effect on\nthe mechanical properties of graphene using molecular dynamics simulations. The\nbehavior of zigzag and armchair graphene structures with cracks separated by\ndistances ($W_\\text{gap}$) is analyzed under tensile loading. The findings\nreveal that crack coalescence, defined as the formation of a new crack from two\nexisting crack tips, occurs for lower values of the distance between cracks,\n$W_\\text{gap}$, resulting in a decline in the strength of structures. As\n$W_\\text{gap}$ increases, the stress-strain curves shift upward, with the peak\nstress rising in the absence of crack coalescence. The effective stress\nintensity factor formulated in this study exhibits a clear upward trend with\nincreasing $W_\\text{gap}$.

We evaluate three code models of\nvarying sizes on a suite of code comprehension tasks designed to assess\nsemantic understanding beyond surface-level syntactic pattern matching.

    "abstract": "Time delay is ubiquitous in many experimental and real-world situations. It\nis often unclear whether time delay plays a significant role in observed\nphenomena, and if it does, how long the time lag really is. This would be\ninvaluable knowledge when analyzing and modeling such systems. Hitherto, no\nuniversal method is available by which the time delay can be inferred. To\naddress this problem, we propose and demonstrate two different methods to infer\ntime delay in overdamped Langevin systems with delayed feedback. In the first\npart, we focus on the power spectral density based on the positional data and\nuse a characteristic signature of the time delay to infer the delay time. In\nlimiting cases, we establish a direct relation of the observations made for\nnonlinear time-delayed feedback forces to analytical results obtained for the\nlinear system. In other situations despite the absence of this direct relation,\nthe characteristic signature remains and can be exploited by a semiautomatic\nmethod to infer the delay time. Furthermore, it may not always desirable or\npossible to observe a system for a long time to infer dependencies and\nparameters. Thus, in the second part, we propose for the first time a probing\nmethod combined with a neural network to infer the delay time, which requires\nonly short observation time series. These proposed methods for inferring time\ndelays in stochastic systems may prove to be valuable tools for gaining deeper\ninsight into the role of delay across a wide range of applications -- from the\nbehavior of individual colloidal particles under feedback control to emergent\ncollective phenomena such as flocking and swarming.",

To answer this,\nwe propose SMACS, a scalable multi-agent collaboration system (MACS) framework\nwith high performance. Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and\ngeneralization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior\nSelection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select\nthe Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose\nan Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the\ngeneration of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the\nhigh-quality response via a hybrid posterior score. Experiments on eight\nmainstream benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our SMACS: by integrating\nfifteen open-source LLMs, SMACS outperforms leading closed-source LLMs in 2025,\ne.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet (+12.73%), GPT-4.1(+5.36%) and GPT-o3-mini(+5.28%)\nacross multiple tasks.

Its most common variant, dubbed split\nconformal prediction, is also computationally efficient as it boils down to\ncollecting statistics of the model predictions on some calibration data not yet\nseen by the model. Nonetheless, these guarantees only hold if the calibration\nand test data are exchangeable, a condition that is difficult to verify and\noften violated in practice due to so-called distribution shifts. The literature\nis rife with methods to mitigate the loss in coverage in this non-exchangeable\nsetting, but these methods require some prior information on the type of\ndistribution shift to be expected at test time. In this work, we study this\nproblem via a new perspective, through the lens of optimal transport, and show\nthat it is possible to estimate the loss in coverage and mitigate it in case of\ndistribution shift.",

Using this concept as a lens to study\nhow GenAI tools are integrated into open-source software projects, we analyze a\ncurated sample of more than 250,000 GitHub repositories, identifying 1,292 such\nself-admissions across 156 repositories in commit messages, code comments, and\nproject documentation.

We then analyze 13 documents with policies\nand usage guidelines for GenAI tools and conduct a developer survey to uncover\nthe ethical, legal, and practical concerns behind them. Our findings reveal\nthat developers actively manage how GenAI is used in their projects,\nhighlighting the need for project-level transparency, attribution, and quality\ncontrol practices in the new era of AI-assisted software development.

Second, we exploit exogenous\nreductions in IPV generated by two randomized interventions - one involving\ncash transfers, the other psychotherapy - and use treatment assignment as an\ninstrument for IPV exposure. Women who experience reduced IPV as a result of\ntreatment exhibit more patient time preferences. Together, these results\nprovide consistent, novel causal evidence that exposure to IPV induces\nindividuals to discount the future more heavily. This evidence suggests a\npsychological channel through which violence can perpetuate economic\ndisadvantage and constrain women's ability to take actions - such as saving,\ninvesting, or exiting abusive relationships - that require planning over time.",

This result, known as the FLP impossibility theorem, led to several\ngeneralizations and developments in theoretical distributed computing.

On the other\nhand, the more complex and larger semantic image segmentation models become,\nthe more stressed the devices are when processing data. This paper proposes a\nnovel approach to implementing semantic communication based on splitting the\nsemantic image segmentation process between a resource constrained transmitter\nand the receiver. This allows saving bandwidth by reducing the transmitted data\nwhile maintaining the accuracy of the semantic image segmentation.\nAdditionally, it reduces the computational requirements at the resource\nconstrained transmitter compared to doing all the semantic image segmentation\nin the transmitter. The proposed approach is evaluated by means of\nsimulation-based experiments in terms of different metrics such as\ncomputational resource usage, required bit rate and segmentation accuracy. The\nresults when comparing the proposal with the full semantic image segmentation\nin the transmitter show that up to 72% of the bit rate was reduced in the\ntransmission process. In addition, the computational load of the transmitter is\nreduced by more than 19%.

    "abstract": "The discovery of high temperature superconductivity in the nickelate system\nhas stimulated enormous interest in the community of condensed matter physics.\nRecently, superconductivity with an onset transition temperature (Tc^onset)\nover 40 K was achieved in La3Ni2O7 and (La,Pr)3Ni2O7 thin films at ambient\npressure due to in-plane compressive strain. This observation has sparked\nenormous attention because measurements on superconducting properties can be\naccessible with many commonly used experimental tools. On the other hand, the\nTc in these thin films is much lower than that of the bulk bilayer nickelates\nunder pressure. Here we report the enhancement of Tc^onset to over 60 K by\napplying hydrostatic pressure on the compressively strained superconducting\nbilayer nickelate thin films. The Tc^onset firstly ramps up with pressure, then\nit slightly drops down after reaching the maximum Tc^onset at about 61.5 K\nunder a pressure of 9 GPa, showing a dome-like phase diagram. Hall effect\nmeasurements reveal that the dominant charge carriers are hole-like with a\nslight enhancement of charge carrier density with pressure in accompanying with\nthe increase of Tc. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the enhancement of\nTc arises from a cooperative amplification of magnetic fluctuations within and\nbetween the layers and increased metallicity under pressure. However, this\nenhancement exhibits saturation at higher pressures. These findings highlight\nthe critical role of the interplay between interlayer and intralayer electronic\ncorrelations in bilayer nickelate superconductors and point to the potential of\ntuning Tc through controlled manipulation of the electronic structure and\ninteractions.",

This\npaper develops a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the\nREOSSP to optimally solve the scheduling problem for given parameters.\nAdditionally, since the REOSSP can be computationally expensive for large-scale\nproblems, a rolling horizon procedure (RHP) solution method is developed. The\nperformance of the REOSSP is benchmarked against the EOSSP, which serves as a\nbaseline, through a set of random instances where problem characteristics are\nvaried and a case study in which Hurricane Sandy is used to demonstrate\nrealistic performance.

Analysis of capture-recapture data is often complicated by\nthe existence of one-inflation and heterogeneity problems. Simultaneously\ntaking these issues into account, existing abundance estimation methods are\nusually constructed on the basis of conditional likelihood (CL) under\none-inflated zero-truncated count models. However, the resulting\nHorvitz-Thompson-type estimators may be unstable, and the resulting Wald-type\nconfidence intervals may exhibit severe undercoverage. In this paper, we\npropose a semiparametric empirical likelihood (EL) approach to abundance\nestimation under one-inflated binomial and Poisson regression models. We show\nthat the maximum EL estimator for the abundance follows an asymptotically\nnormal distribution and that the EL ratio statistic of abundance follows a\nlimiting chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom. To facilitate\ncomputation of the EL method, we develop an expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm, and establish its appealing convergence property. We also propose a\nnew score test for the existence of one-inflation and prove its asymptotic\nnormality. Our simulation studies indicate that compared with CL-based methods,\nthe maximum EL estimator has a smaller mean square error, the EL ratio\nconfidence interval has a remarkable gain in coverage probability, and the\nproposed score test is more powerful.

In this work, we pose query reformulation as a\ntoken classification task, and solve this task by designing a dependency-aware\ntransformer-based language model, TagBERT, which makes use of semantic tags of\na token for learning superior query phrase embedding. Experiments on large,\nreal-life e-commerce datasets show that TagBERT exhibits superior performance\nthan plethora of competing models, including BERT, eBERT, and\nSequence-to-Sequence transformer model for important token classification task.",

    "abstract": "Perturbations of the Kerr black hole are notoriously difficult to describe in\nthe metric formalism and are usually studied in terms of perturbations of the\nWeyl scalars. In this work, we focus on the algebraically special linear\nperturbations (ASLP) of the Kerr geometry and show how one can describe this\nsubsector of the perturbations solely using the metric formulation. To that\nend, we consider the most general twisting algebraically special solution space\nof vacuum General Relativity. By linearizing around the Kerr solution, we\nobtain two coupled partial differential wave equations describing the dynamics\nof the Kerr ASLP. We provide an algorithm to solve them analytically in the\nsmall spin approximation up to third order, providing the first exact solution\nof this kind in the metric formulation. Then, we use this framework to study\nthe stationary zero modes of the Kerr geometry. We present the exact analytical\nform of the shifts in mass and spin together with the required change of\ncoordinates needed to identify them. Finally, we also provide for the first\ntime closed expressions for the solution-generating perturbations generating\nthe NUT and acceleration charges, thus deforming the Kerr solution to the\nlinearized Kerr-NUT and spinning C-metric. These results provide a first\nconcrete and rare example of perturbations of the Kerr black hole which can be\ntreated entirely in the metric formulation. They can serve as a useful testbed\nto search for hidden symmetries of the Kerr perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field that is gaining\nrapid adoption due to its robustness and ability to effectively describe\ncomplex datasets by quantifying geometric information. In imaging contexts, TDA\ntypically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract\ndiscriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local\nfeatures. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering\npipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep\nlearning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the\nperformance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving\n99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model\naccuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x\nlarger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our\nmethod's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45\ndataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in\nsatellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA\nfeatures can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without\nexplicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA.

We have determined the HCN, HNC,\nand N2H+ isotopic ratios and the chemical age in a large sample of 23 starless\ncores located in different environments. This work uses IRAM 30m data to\nconstrain the D/H ratio of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ as well as the 14N/15N ratio of\nHCN and HNC. The observed abundances have been modeled using the chemical code\nDNAUTILUS 2.0. Deuterated compounds are detected in all of our sample cores,\nwith average DNC/HNC, DCN/HCN, and N2D+/N2H+ values of 0.054$\\pm$0.019,\n0.036$\\pm$0.033, and 0.15$\\pm$0.11, respectively. The deuterium fractions\n(Dfrac) show a weak correlation with temperature and a large scatter that\nreflects that other factors such as core evolution could also play a\nsignificant role. Our chemical model is able to reproduce all the observed\nvalues with 0.2-0.3 Myr in Taurus and 0.3-0.5 Myr in Perseus and Orion. The\n14N/15N isotopic ratio is found to be different between HCN/HC15N (430$\\pm$120)\nand HNC/H15NC (296$\\pm$64). We find no correlation between these ratios and the\ndeuterium fractions, but we report a weak correlation with temperature. The\nDfrac of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ can be used as evolutionary tracers of starless\ncores as long as the physical parameters are well constrained. The HCN/HC15N\nand HNC/H15NC ratios are not correlated with Dfrac, suggesting that the\ndetected variations are not correlated with the core evolutionary stage. The\naverage value of the HCN/HC15N ratio in our sample is significantly higher than\nthe values measured in protostars and protoplanetary disks, possibly indicating\nthat nitrogen fractionation processes are taking place during the protostellar\nphase.",

This is typically done by fitting the optimal\nkappa distribution function and interpreting its so-called q-statistics to\ncharacterize the magnetic field increments. Using this approach, recent\nfindings concluded that beyond a certain distance, the magnetic field\nincrements in the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) follow Gaussian\nstatistics, unlike those both inside the heliosphere and in the region just\nbeyond the widely accepted heliopause location, raising questions about the\nheliopause identification. This study explores this issue in detail by (1)\noptimizing the derivation of the distribution function, (2) examining whether\nand how the results depend on increment windows and time periods, and (3)\ndetermining the statistical behavior of the examined time series. Using\nmagnetic field measurements from Voyager 1, we present two independent\ntechniques and introduce a statistical framework to systematically analyze the\ndistributions of magnetic field increments. Contrary to previous findings, we\nfind that magnetic field increments in the VLISM do not follow a Gaussian\ndistribution (k to infinity) and instead are in the non-Gaussian range of kappa\nvalues (3-7, when analyzed on a 30-day statistical period). We further\ndemonstrate how erroneous, statistically induced results can arise that mimic\nGaussian-like results when mixing different structures in such analyses. Our\nresults show that Voyager 1 still travels in the intermittent magnetic field\nenvironment of the VLISM.",

We aim to investigate how the structure and nucleosynthesis\nevolve and how these processes influence the stellar fate.

The updated 12C({\\alpha},{\\gamma})16O rates mainly impact\nthe chemical structure evolution changing the 12C/16O ratio with little effect\non the CO core mass. This variation in the 12C/16O ratio is critical for\npredicting the stellar fate, which is very sensitive to 12C abundance. The\ncombined new rates for 12C+12C and 16O+16O fusion reactions according to the\nHIN(RES) model lead to shorter C- and O-burning lifetimes, and shift the\nignition conditions to higher temperatures and densities. Theoretical TDHF\nrates primarily affect C-burning, increasing its duration and lowering the\nignition temperature. These changes alter the core chemical structure, the\ncarbon shell size and duration, and hence the compactness. They also affect\nnucleosynthesis. This work shows that accurate reaction rates for key processes\nin massive star evolution drive significant changes in stellar burning\nlifetimes, chemical evolution, and stellar fate.

A difficulty in areas such as genomics, where the\nnumber of candidate variables is vast, arises from the need for preliminary\nreduction prior to the assessment of models. The present paper considers a\nresolution using inferential separations fundamental to the Fisherian approach\nto conditional inference, namely, the sufficiency/co-sufficiency separation,\nand the ancillary/co-ancillary separation. The advantage of these separations\nis that no direction for departure from any hypothesised model is needed,\navoiding issues that would otherwise arise from using the same data for\nreduction and for model assessment. In idealised cases with no nuisance\nparameters, the separations extract all the information in the data, solely for\nthe purpose for which it is useful, without loss or redundancy. The extent to\nwhich estimation of nuisance parameters affects the idealised information\nextraction is illustrated in detail for the normal-theory linear regression\nmodel, extending immediately to a log-normal accelerated-life model for\ntime-to-event outcomes. This idealised analysis provides insight into when\nsample-splitting is likely to perform as well as, or better than, the\nco-sufficient or ancillary tests, and when it may be unreliable. The\nconsiderations involved in extending the detailed implementation to canonical\nexponential-family and more general regression models are briefly discussed.

The stable materials exhibit a rich\nspectrum of properties, including diverse magnetic orders (FM, AFM) and\nLuttinger compensated antiferromagnetism in MnTe. We discovered 20 ferroelastic\nchains, with FeTe showing a giant magnetostriction of -5.57%. Other emergent\nphenomena include Charge Density Wave (CDW) chains in FeTe and NiSe.

Our aerodynamical\nsimulations reveal the formation of complex shock structures, including\nsecondary shock waves, which influence the thermodynamic evolution of the gas\nmedium. By tracking thermodynamic parameters along streamlines, we analyze the\neffects of shock heating and subsequent expansion cooling on chemical reaction\npathways.

In the short time since their introduction, classical shadows\nreceived a lot of attention from the physics, quantum information, and quantum\ncomputing (including cryptography) communities. In particular there has been a\nmajor effort focused on improving the efficiency, and in particular depth, of\ngenerating the classical snapshot.\n  Existing constructions rely on a distribution of unitaries as a central\nbuilding block, and research is devoted to simplifying this family as much as\npossible. We diverge from this paradigm and show that suitable distributions\nover \\emph{states} can be used as the building block instead. Concretely, we\ncreate the snapshot by entangling the unknown input state with an independently\nprepared auxiliary state, and measuring the resulting entangled state. This\nstate-based approach allows us to consider a building block with arguably\nweaker properties that has not been studied so far in the context of classical\nshadows. Notably, our cryptographically-inspired analysis shows that for\n\\emph{efficiently computable} observables, it suffices to use\n\\emph{pseudorandom} families of states. To the best of our knowledge,\n\\emph{computational} classical shadow tomography was not considered in the\nliterature prior to our work.\n  Finally, in terms of efficiency, the online part of our method (i.e.\\ the\npart that depends on the input) is simply performing a measurement in the Bell\nbasis, which can be done in constant depth using elementary gates.",

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a\ngeneralized analytical count-rate model for free-running SPADs that models the\nnon-instantaneous, exponential recovery of the quantum efficiency following\ndead-time. Our model, framed within the theory of non-homogeneous Poisson\nprocesses, only requires one additional detector parameter -- the\nexponential-recovery time constant $\\tau_\\mathrm{r}$. The model accurately\npredicts detection statistics deep into the saturation regime, outperforming\nthe conventional step-function model by two orders of magnitude in terms of the\nimpinging photon rate. For extremely high photon flux, we further extend the\nmodel to capture paralyzation effects. Beyond photon flux estimation, our model\nsimplifies SPAD characterization by enabling the extraction of quantum\nefficiency $\\eta_0$, dead-time $\\tau_\\mathrm{d}$, and recovery time constant\n$\\tau_\\mathrm{r}$ from a single inter-detection interval histogram. This can be\nachieved with a simple setup, without the need for pulsed lasers or externally\ngated detectors. We anticipate broad applicability of our model in quantum key\ndistribution (QKD), time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), LIDAR, and\nrelated areas.

    "abstract": "The widespread use of social media applications has raised significant\nprivacy concerns, often highlighted in user reviews. These reviews also provide\ndevelopers with valuable insights into improving apps by addressing issues and\nintroducing better features. However, the sheer volume and nuanced nature of\nreviews make manual identification and prioritization of privacy-related\nconcerns challenging for developers. Previous studies have developed software\nutilities to automatically classify user reviews as privacy-relevant,\nprivacy-irrelevant, bug reports, feature requests, etc., using machine\nlearning. Notably, there is a lack of focus on classifying reviews specifically\nas privacy-related feature requests, privacy-related bug reports, or\nprivacy-irrelevant. This paper introduces SENtinel SORt (SENSOR), an automated\nonline annotation tool designed to help developers annotate and classify user\nreviews into these categories. For automating the annotation of such reviews,\nthis paper introduces the annotation model, GRACE (GRU-based Attention with\nCBOW Embedding), using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with Continuous Bag of Words\n(CBOW) and Attention mechanism. Approximately 16000 user reviews from seven\npopular social media apps on Google Play Store, including Instagram, Facebook,\nWhatsApp, Snapchat, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook Lite, and Line were\nanalyzed. Two annotators manually labelled the reviews, achieving a Cohen's\nKappa value of 0.87, ensuring a labeled dataset with high inter-rater agreement\nfor training machine learning models. Among the models tested, GRACE\ndemonstrated the best performance (macro F1-score: 0.9434, macro ROC-AUC:\n0.9934, and accuracy: 95.10%) despite class imbalance. SENSOR demonstrates\nsignificant potential to assist developers with extracting and addressing\nprivacy-related feature requests or bug reports from user reviews, enhancing\nuser privacy and trust.",

    "abstract": "Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in\ntransferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to\ndownstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual\nfeature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to\ninherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists\nsignificant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such\ndescription diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can\nbenefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic\nadapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,\nit is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To\naddress these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter\nand develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first\nmodels the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class\nrelationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex\nRandom Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message\npropagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each\nclass node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve\ntextual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter\nsolution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In\naddition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also\nintroduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that\ndynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach.",

To simplify the analysis of a closed-loop\nsystem's Region of Attraction (RoA), the first problem explicitly parameterizes\na class of candidate Lyapunov functions larger than in previous works. The\nsecond problem utilizes the unique guarantees available under the condition of\ninvariance to further expand the set of candidate Lyapunov functions and\ndirectly determine whether an invariant set forms part of the system's RoA.\nThese contributions are successfully demonstrated in two numerical examples and\nsuggestions for future research are provided.",

To better aggregate knowledge from clients,\nensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often\nemployed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global\nmodel. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not\nalways yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The\nreason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which,\nwhile being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for\nthe knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous\nFederated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature\ninformation via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous\nmodels better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge\ndistillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to\nmaintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align\nthe features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize\nthe projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and\nthus maximize the distilled knowledge.

    "abstract": "In his paper `Conjectures on Bridgeland Stability', Joyce asked if one can\ndesingularise the transverse intersection point of an immersed Lagrangian using\nJLT expanders such that one gets a Lagrangian mean curvature flow via the\ndesingularisations. Begley and Moore answered this in the affirmative by\nconstructing a family of desingularisations and showing that a certain limit\nalong their flows satisfies LMCF along with convergence to the immersed\nLagrangian in the sense of varifolds. We prove that there exists a solution\nwith convergence in a stronger sense, using the notion of manifolds with\ncorners and a-corners as introduced by Joyce. Our methods are a direct P.D.E.\nbased approach, along the lines of the proof of short-time existence for\nnetwork flow by Lira, Mazzeo, Pluda and Saez.",

    "abstract": "Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as\ntext-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits\ntheir use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network\nquantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient\ndiffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not\nconsider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of\ninformation for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization\nmethod dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text\nPrompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit\nprecision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be\nseamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance\nquantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the\nquality of the generated images across various datasets.",

To bridge this gap, we propose\nAssertCoder, a novel unified framework that automatically generates\nhigh-quality SVAs directly from multimodal hardware design specifications.\nAssertCoder employs a modality-sensitive preprocessing to parse heterogeneous\nspecification formats (text, tables, diagrams, and formulas), followed by a set\nof dedicated semantic analyzers that extract structured representations aligned\nwith signal-level semantics. These representations are utilized to drive\nassertion synthesis via multi-step chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. The\nframework incorporates a mutation-based evaluation approach to assess assertion\nquality via model checking and further refine the generated assertions.\nExperimental evaluation across three real-world Register-Transfer Level (RTL)\ndesigns demonstrates AssertCoder's superior performance, achieving an average\nincrease of 8.4% in functional correctness and 5.8% in mutation detection\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

To address this challenge,\nlossless log compression has emerged as an effective solution, enabling\nsubstantial resource savings without compromising log information. In this\npaper, we first conduct a characterization study on extensive public log\ndatasets and identify four key observations. Building on these insights, we\npropose LogLite, a lightweight, plug-and-play, streaming lossless compression\nalgorithm designed to handle both TEXT and JSON logs throughout their life\ncycle. LogLite requires no predefined rules or pre-training and is inherently\nadaptable to evolving log structures. Our evaluation shows that, compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines, LogLite achieves Pareto optimality in most\nscenarios, delivering an average improvement of up to 67.8% in compression\nratio and up to 2.7 $\\times$ in compression speed.",

Despite numerous imputation techniques, a\nsystematic performance evaluation for IMU-derived MoCap time-series data is\nlacking. We address this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis\nof statistical, machine learning, and deep learning imputation methods. Our\nevaluation considers three distinct contexts: univariate time-series,\nmultivariate across subjects, and multivariate across kinematic angles. To\nfacilitate this benchmark, we introduce the first publicly available MoCap\ndataset designed specifically for imputation, featuring data from 53 karate\npractitioners. We simulate three controlled missingness mechanisms: missing\ncompletely at random (MCAR), block missingness, and a novel value-dependent\npattern at signal transition points. Our experiments, conducted on 39 kinematic\nvariables across all subjects, reveal that multivariate imputation frameworks\nconsistently outperform univariate approaches, particularly for complex\nmissingness. For instance, multivariate methods achieve up to a 50% mean\nabsolute error reduction (MAE from 10.8 to 5.8) compared to univariate\ntechniques for transition point missingness. Advanced models like Generative\nAdversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) and Iterative Imputers demonstrate the\nhighest accuracy in these challenging scenarios. This work provides a critical\nbaseline for future research and offers practical recommendations for improving\nthe integrity and robustness of Mo-Cap data analysis.",

Contrary to the intuitive expectation of a positive green\npremium, we find no evidence that climate-friendly products are priced higher.\nIn some product categories, products with better climate scores are in fact\nassociated with lower prices, suggesting a negative premium, an outcome that\ngives rise to what we refer to as the green premium puzzle.

We find that a stable sex ratio at birth (SRB)\ndiffering from 1:1 can arise when these continuation probabilities differ.\nHowever, the sex ratio among last-born children (SRLB) always converges to 1:1.\nWe mathematically prove that this 1:1 SRLB is an evolutionarily stable strategy\nunder a new fitness measure based on the number of offspring in successful\nmating pairs, rather than the number of descendants in the whole population.\nOur results generalize Fisher's principle by showing that equilibrium is\nmaintained at the level of last births even when the overall SRB is biased.\nThis offers a potential explanation for the persistent slight male bias in\nhuman births, linking it to sex-specific child mortality and parental\nreproductive strategies in historical populations.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior\nwork has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional\narchitectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space\nmodels (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose\nunique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter\ndynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on\nGrowth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the\nimpact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM\nfor three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models\n(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance\nresilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on\nclean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)\nrobustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to\n8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our\napproach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial\ndefense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM",

A key challenge\nlies in the fact that experimental probes are generally restricted to diagonal\nquantities at the single-site scale, which are widely believed to be\ninsufficient for detecting phases with off-diagonal long-range order, such as\nsuperconducting states. In a striking departure from conventional expectations,\nwe show that single-site diagonal descriptors -- charge and spin fluctuations,\noccupation probabilities, and entanglement -- can capture the emergence of\noff-diagonal long-range order in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at\nhalf-filling. These single-site quantities display clear critical signatures of\nthe superconducting transition, preceded by a continuous breaking of\nparticle-hole symmetry, consistent with a second-order phase transition. While\nthis symmetry breaking has a negligible effect on single-site descriptors, it\nallows a direct connection between local fluctuations and nonlocal\ncorrelations.",

Like other single deep\nregressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to\nperform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network\nis typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In\norder to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with\nseveral expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset\nwith a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its\nrestoration performance for a particular quality range.

As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators\nwhere the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression\ntask.

Numerous\nsolutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using\nthe model itself to edit prompts. However, the majority of state-of-the-art\napproaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on\nvery large and highly capable LLMs. In contrast, solving complex tasks that\nrequire detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount\nof text that needs to be optimised. Furthermore, smaller models have been shown\nto be more sensitive to prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose\nan evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation\nconsisting of two phases. In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic\nprogramming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching\nthe space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic,\ndictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions.

    "abstract": "Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm\nthat improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous\nworks have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into\nfeature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the\nfoundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image\nunderstanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings\nderived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the\noptimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective\nmechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image\nunderstanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle\nwhen addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we\nintroduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching\nwith a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant\nsolutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize\nglobal semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to\neffectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism\nin generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image\ninteraction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information\ninteraction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,\nwe propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance\nscenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly\nevaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our\nmethod efficiently mitigates the misalignment.",

SVGPR is an approximation to standard GPR, the latter of which\nsuffers severe computational scaling with N and assumes independently\ndistributed Gaussian Noise. In the Galaxy however, velocity measurements\nexhibit scatter from both observational uncertainty and the intrinsic velocity\ndispersion of the distribution function. We exploit the factorization property\nof the objective function in SVGPR to simultaneously model both the mean\nvelocity field and velocity dispersion tensor as separate Gaussian Processes.\nThis achieves a computational complexity of O(M^3) versus GPR's O(N^3), where M\n<< N is a subset of points chosen in a principled way to summarize the data.\nApplied to a sample of ~8 x 10^5 stars from the Gaia DR3 Radial Velocity\nSurvey, we construct differentiable profiles of the mean velocity and velocity\ndispersion as functions of height above the Galactic midplane. We find\nasymmetric features in all three diagonal components of the velocity dispersion\ntensor, providing evidence that the vertical dynamics of the Milky Way are in a\nstate of disequilibrium.

Here we present a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral\nanalysis based on new UV and archival optical spectra of one of the hottest PG\n1159 stars, $\\text{RX J}0122.9\\text{ -}7521$. We find $T_\\text{eff} = 175$ kK\nand a surface gravity of log $g = 7.7$, and an astonishingly low O/C ratio of\n$7.3 \\times 10^{-3}$ by mass. By combining the spectroscopic surface gravity\nand Gaia parallax with a spectral energy distribution fit, we derive a mass of\n$M_\\text{spec} = 1.8^{+1.1}_{-0.7}$ $M_\\odot$. Although this spectroscopic mass\nis higher than predicted by evolutionary models, it is subject to substantial\nuncertainty. Furthermore, we find that $\\text{RX J}0122.9\\text{ -}7521$ shows\nstrongly rotationally broadened lines, suggesting that the previously reported\nphotometric period of $41$ min indeed corresponds to the rotational period of\nthis star. Our kinematic analysis shows that $\\text{RX J}0122.9\\text{ -}7521$\nbelongs to the Galactic halo, which - assuming single-star evolution - is in\nstark contrast to its relatively high mass. The rapid rotation, high mass, and\nhalo kinematics, as well as the lack of evidence for a close companion, lead us\nto believe that $\\text{RX J}0122.9\\text{ -}7521$ formed through the merger of\ntwo white dwarfs. Yet, none of the current models can explain the surface\nabundances of $\\text{RX J}0122.9\\text{ -}7521$.",

Path following\nis a typical use case for model predictive control (MPC), but formulating\nconstraints for obstacle avoidance is challenging in this case. Typically the\ncost and constraints of an MPC problem are defined as closed-form functions and\ntypical solvers work best with continuously differentiable functions. This is\ncontrary to spatially discrete occupancy grid maps, in which a grid's value\ndefines the cost associated with occupancy. This paper presents a way to\novercome this compatibility issue by re-formulating occupancy grid maps to\ncontinuously differentiable functions to be embedded into the MPC scheme as\nconstraints. Each obstacle is defined as a polygon -- an intersection of\nhalf-spaces. Any half-space is a linear inequality representing one edge of a\npolygon. Using AND and OR operators, the combined set of all obstacles and\ntherefore the obstacle avoidance constraints can be described. The key\ncontribution of this paper is the use of fuzzy logic to re-formulate such\nconstraints that include logical operators as inequality constraints which are\ncompatible with standard MPC formulation.

Additionally, accurately\ncharacterizing the response distribution can require prohibitively large\ndatasets, especially for computationally expensive high-fidelity (HF)\nsimulators.

In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal\nlarge language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To\nconstruct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that\nuses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality\nquestion-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting\ncorpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including\nexpression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various\nface-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work\nhighlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for\nbuilding domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy,\nhuman-centric multimodal AI systems. FairFaceGPT dataset and pretrained FaceLLM\nmodels are publicly available in the project page.",

    "abstract": "Solar activity events release vast amounts of energy, including radio waves,\nX-rays, ultraviolet radiation, and energetic particles, which interact with the\nionosphere of the Earth and can disrupt radio wave propagation, affecting radio\ncommunications. They can either enhance reflections, improving long-distance\nterrestrial communications, or cause signal degradation and absorption,\nrespectively, depending on whether the increased ionization affects the upper\nor lower layers of the ionosphere. In the first case, the solar cycle modulates\nthe Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF), the highest frequency usable for radio\ncommunication between two Earth-based points. The Auger Engineering Radio Array\n(AERA) of the Pierre Auger Observatory was developed to measure the radio\nemission from extensive air showers in the $30-80$ MHz band. We examine the\nimpact of solar activity on AERA data collected over approximately 11 years. We\nreport the detection of different types of solar radio bursts and we\ninvestigate how increased solar radiation - particularly in the X-ray and\nextreme ultraviolet bands - also affects measurements in the AERA energy band.\nOur results show a remarkable correlation between the MUF and the broadband\nnoise observed in the $30-40$ MHz frequency range. Radio blackouts are also\nobserved in AERA spectrograms in coincidence with those reported by the\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, we\nperformed a search for temporal coincidences between AERA data and independent\nobservations of solar radio burst events from the e-CALLISTO network and the\nSWAVES instrument.

Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,\nidentity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing\naverage-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality\nreference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during\nthe denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity\ninformation from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention\nmechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip\nidentity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback\nlearning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with\nsuffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift\nwithin sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an\nexponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by\niteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process.\nThis method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips.\nAdditionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative\nprompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and\nminimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR\noutperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation,\nshowcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video\nrestoration.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success\nacross various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range\nself-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer\narchitectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting\nthe underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal\nfeature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token\nClustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based\ndownsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic\nmeanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less\ninformative regions and more to represent semantically important regions,\nregardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance\nfeature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak\nClustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center\ndetermination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a\nchannel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments\non 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer\non image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer\nbaseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets,\n1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55%\non four remote sensing datasets.

    "abstract": "A qubit-oscillator junction connecting as a series two bosonic heat baths at\ndifferent temperatures can display heat valve and diode effects. In particular,\nthe rectification can change in magnitude and even in sign, implying an\ninversion of the preferential direction for the heat current with respect to\nthe temperature bias. We perform a systematic study of these effects in a\ncircuit QED model of qubit-oscillator system and find that the features of\ncurrent and rectification crucially depend on the qubit-oscillator coupling.\nWhile at small coupling, transport occurs via a resonant mechanism between the\nsub-systems, in the ultrastrong coupling regime the junction is a unique,\nhighly hybridized system and the current becomes largely insensitive to the\ndetuning. Correspondingly, the rectification undergoes a change of sign. In the\nnonlinear transport regime, the coupling strength determines whether the\ncurrent scales sub- or super-linearly with the temperature bias and whether the\nrectification, which increases in magnitude with the bias, is positive or\nnegative. We also find that steady-state coherence largely suppresses the\ncurrent and enhances rectification. An insight on these behaviors with respect\nto changes in the system parameters is provided by analytical approximate\nformulas.",

These theories are based on\nextensive observations of high-energy solar processes, providing substantial\ndirect evidence in the MeV energy range. Although the model is widely and\nsuccessfully used to explain high-energy cosmic phenomena, direct validation\nhas been elusive. The multi-wavelength spectra and angular profile measurements\nof the Geminga pulsar wind nebula and its pulsar halo, particularly the precise\nspectral observations by HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A in recent years, offer a rare\nopportunity to test these theories with cosmic rays energies between 1 TeV and\nseveral hundred TeV. These observations are expected to elevate the direct\ntesting of theoretical models from multi-MeV to sub-PeV energies. In this work,\na method is developed to test the diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion\npropagation model between one and several hundred TeV energies through the\nlatest spectral and morphological data of the Geminga region from HAWC and\nFermi-LAT. Our results show that the theories of diffusive shock acceleration\nand diffusion propagation are consistent with experimental observations.\nHowever, the published morphological data adopted rather wide energy bins and\ncurrently do not allow a high precision test of the inferred energy dependent\ndiffusion coefficient by observed energy spectra with DSA theory. It is\nanticipated that future HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A observations will yield\nhigher-precision results, and the confirmation of a rapidly increasing\ndiffusion coefficient above 100 TeV would serve as important evidence\nsupporting the diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion propagation theory.",

Results indicate that the\nAfriTEC model effectively captures the diurnal and seasonal behavior of TEC,\nparticularly during equinoxes, with MAE values generally below 1.5 TECU and\ncorrelation coefficients exceeding 0.80. However, discrepancies emerge during\nsolstice periods and post-sunset hours, reflecting the model's limitations in\nrepresenting complex ionospheric processes such as the Equatorial Ionization\nAnomaly (EIA).

While such studies are commonly used to assess\noperational parameters, they also offer a valuable opportunity to inform the\ndesign and analysis of subsequent definitive trials-particularly through the\nuse of Bayesian methods. In this paper, we demonstrate how data from a single,\nprotocol-aligned pilot study can be incorporated into a definitive trial using\nrobust meta-analytic-predictive priors. We focus on the case of a binary\nefficacy outcome, motivated by a feasibility trial of intravenous\nimmunoglobulin tapering in autoimmune inflammatory myopathies. Through\nsimulation studies, we evaluate the operating characteristics of trials\ninformed by pilot data, including sample size, expected trial duration, and the\nprobability of meeting recruitment targets. Our findings highlight the\noperational and ethical advantages of leveraging pilot data via robust Bayesian\npriors, and offer practical guidance for their application in rare disease\nsettings.",

In 1999, Reed confirmed the conjecture when $\\Delta\\geq\n10^{14}$.\n  We propose different generalisations of this conjecture for digraphs, and\nprove the analogue of Reed's result for each of them. The chromatic number and\nclique number are replaced respectively by the dichromatic number and the\nbiclique number of digraphs. If $D$ is a digraph such that\n$\\min(\\tilde{\\Delta}(D),\\Delta^+(D)) = \\Delta \\geq 9$, we conjecture that $D$\nhas dichromatic number at most $\\Delta-1$, unless either (i) $D$ contains a\nbiclique of size $\\Delta$, or (ii) $D$ contains a biclique $K$ of size\n$\\Delta-2$, a directed $3$-cycle $\\vec{C_3}$ disjoint from $K$, and all\npossible arcs in both directions between $\\vec{C_3}$ and $K$. If true, this\nimplies the conjecture of Borodin and Kostochka. We prove it when $\\Delta$ is\nlarge enough, thereby generalising the result of Reed.\n  We finally give a sufficient condition for a digraph $D$ to have dichromatic\nnumber at most $\\Delta_{\\min}(D)-1$, assuming that $\\Delta_{\\min}(D)$ is large\nenough. In particular, this holds when the underlying graph of $D$ has no\nclique of size $\\Delta_{\\min}(D)$, thus yielding a third independent\ngeneralisation of Reed's result. We further give a hardness result witnessing\nthat our sufficient condition is best possible.\n  To obtain these new upper bounds on the dichromatic number, we prove a dense\ndecomposition lemma for digraphs having large maximum degree, which generalises\nto the directed setting the so-called dense decomposition of graphs due to\nMolloy and Reed.

One of the\nmost promising developments is the application of this technique in border\nsecurity for the inspection of cargo inside trucks and sea containers in order\nto search for hazardous and illicit hidden materials. This work focuses on the\noptimization studies for a muon tomography system similar to that being\ndeveloped within the framework of the `SilentBorder' project funded by the EU\nHorizon 2020 scheme. Current studies are directed toward optimizing the\ndetector module design, following two complementary approaches. The first\nleverages TomOpt, a Python-based end-to-end software that employs\ndifferentiable programming to optimize scattering tomography detector\nconfigurations. While TomOpt inherently supports gradient-based optimization, a\nBayesian Optimization module is introduced to better handle scenarios with\nnoisy objective functions, particularly in image reconstruction-driven\noptimization tasks. The second optimization strategy relies on detailed\nGEANT4-based simulations, which, while more computationally intensive, offer\nhigher physical fidelity. These simulations are also employed to study the\nimpact of incorporating secondary particle information alongside cosmic muons\nfor improved material discrimination. This paper presents the current status\nand results obtained from these optimization studies.",

    "abstract": "Quantum tunnelling of electrons can be confined to the sub-cycle time scale\nof strong light fields, contributing decisively to the extreme time resolution\nof attosecond science. Because tunnelling also enables atomic-scale spatial\nresolution in scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), integrating STM with light\npulses has long been a key objective in ultrafast microscopy, spanning the\npicosecond and femtosecond domains, with first signatures of attosecond\ndynamics. However, while sub-cycle dynamics on the attosecond time scale are\nroutinely controlled and determined with high precision, controlling the\ndirection of attosecond currents and determining their duration have remained\nelusive in STM. Here, we induce STM tunnelling currents using two-colour laser\npulses and dynamically control their direction, relying solely on the sub-cycle\nwaveform of the pulses. Projecting our measurement data onto numerical and\nanalytical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation reveals\nnon-adiabatic tunnelling as the underlying physical mechanism, yielding a\ncurrent burst duration of 860 as. Despite working under ambient conditions but\nfree of thermal artifacts, we achieve sub-angstr\\\"om topographic sensitivity\nand a lateral spatial resolution of 2 nm. This unprecedented capability to\ndirectionally control attosecond bursts will enable triggering and imaging\nultrafast charge dynamics in atomic, molecular and condensed systems at the\nspatio-temporal microscopy frontier of lightwave electronics.",

    "abstract": "Existing asynchronous MARL methods based on MacDec-POMDP typically construct\ntraining trajectory buffers by simply sampling limited and biased data at the\nendpoints of macro-actions, and directly apply conventional MARL methods on the\nbuffers. As a result, these methods lead to an incomplete and inaccurate\nrepresentation of the macro-action execution process, along with unsuitable\ncredit assignments. To solve these problems, the Temporal Macro-action Value\nFactorization (ToMacVF) is proposed to achieve fine-grained temporal credit\nassignment for macro-action contributions. A centralized training buffer,\ncalled Macro-action Segmented Joint Experience Replay Trajectory (Mac-SJERT),\nis designed to incorporate with ToMacVF to collect accurate and complete\nmacro-action execution information, supporting a more comprehensive and precise\nrepresentation of the macro-action process. To ensure principled and\nfine-grained asynchronous value factorization, the consistency requirement\nbetween joint and individual macro-action selection called Temporal\nMacro-action based IGM (To-Mac-IGM) is formalized, proving that it generalizes\nthe synchronous cases. Based on To-Mac-IGM, a modularized ToMacVF architecture,\nwhich satisfies CTDE principle, is designed to conveniently integrate previous\nvalue factorization methods. Next, the ToMacVF algorithm is devised as an\nimplementation of the ToMacVF architecture. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat, compared to asynchronous baselines, our ToMacVF algorithm not only\nachieves optimal performance but also exhibits strong adaptability and\nrobustness across various asynchronous multi-agent experimental scenarios.",

For the herding system with\nheterogeneous groups involving herders and evaders, the behavior of the evaders\ncan only be influenced indirectly by the herders' motion, especially when the\nevaders follow an inverse dynamics model and respond solely to repulsive\ninteractions from the herders. This indirect interaction mechanism inherently\nrenders the overall system underactuated. To address this issue, we first\nconstruct separate CBFs for the dual objectives of goal reaching and collision\navoidance, which ensure both herding completion and safety guarantees. Then, we\nreformulate the underactuated herding dynamics into a control-affine structure\nand employ a backstepping approach to recursively design control inputs for the\nhierarchical barrier functions, avoiding taking derivatives of the higher-order\nsystem. Finally, we present a cooperative herding strategy based on\nbackstepping CBFs that allow herders to safely herd multiple evaders into the\ngoal region. In addition, centralized and decentralized implementations of the\nproposed algorithm are developed, further enhancing its flexibility and\napplicability. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the\neffectiveness and safety of the proposed strategy in multi-robot herding.",

NGC300 is a well studied isolated, bulge-less, and low-mass disc galaxy\nideally suited for an investigation of galaxy evolution with radial gas\ninflows. To investigate the effects of radial gas inflows on the physical\nproperties of NGC300, a chemical evolution model for NGC300 is constructed by\nassuming its disc builds up progressively by infalling of metall-free gas and\noutflowing of metal-enriched gas. Radial gas inflows are also considered in the\nmodel. Our model including the radial gas inflows and an inside-out disc\nformation scenario can simultaneously reproduce the present-day observed radial\nprofiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, sSFR, gas-phase\nand stellar metallicity. We find that, although the value of radial gas inflow\nvelocity is as low as -0.1 km/s, the radial gas inflows steepen the present-day\nradial profiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, and\nmetallicity, but flatten the radial sSFR profile. Incorporating radial gas\ninflows significantly improves the agreement between our model predicted\npresent-day sSFR profile and the observations of NGC300.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the Kernel Adaptive Physics-Informed Extreme Learning\nMachine (KAPI-ELM), an adaptive Radial Basis Function (RBF)-based extension of\nPI-ELM designed to solve both forward and inverse Partial Differential Equation\n(PDE) problems involving localized sharp gradients. While PI-ELMs outperform\nthe traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in speed due to their\nsingle-shot, least square optimization, this advantage comes at a cost: their\nfixed, randomly initialized input layer limits their ability to capture sharp\ngradients. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a lightweight Bayesian\nOptimization (BO) framework that, instead of adjusting each input layer\nparameter individually as in traditional backpropagation, learns a small set of\nhyperparameters defining the statistical distribution from which the input\nweights are drawn. This novel distributional optimization strategy -- combining\nBO for input layer distributional parameters with least-squares optimization\nfor output layer network parameters -- enables KAPI-ELM to preserve PI-ELM's\nspeed while matching or exceeding the expressiveness of PINNs. We validate the\nproposed methodology on several challenging forward and inverse PDE benchmarks,\nincluding a 1D singularly perturbed convection-diffusion equation, a 2D Poisson\nequation with sharp localized sources, and a time-dependent advection equation.\nNotably, KAPI-ELM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both forward and\ninverse settings. In stiff PDE regimes, it matches or even outperforms advanced\nmethods such as the Extended Theory of Functional Connections (XTFC), while\nrequiring nearly an order of magnitude fewer tunable parameters. These results\nestablish the potential of KAPI-ELM as a scalable, interpretable, and\ngeneralizable physics-informed learning framework, especially in stiff PDE\nregimes.",

In an\neffort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can\nlikewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we\nperform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those\nrandom areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells.

In our experiments, it turns out that\nin semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and\nstrongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well\nas adversarial attacks.

We perform 2.5-dimensional GRMHD\nsimulations using, as initial conditions, remapped massive star progenitors\npreviously evolved with a state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary codes.\nSpecifically, we adopt the Wolf-Rayet star models 12TH and 16TI from the\nWoosley \\& Heger framework, and we evolve our own Long GRB progenitor with the\nMESA code. A dipolar magnetic field is imposed, with variations in field\nstrength to explore its influence. We find that the jets are magnetically\ndominated, with their thermal and kinetic components remaining comparable\nduring propagation through the stellar envelope. The cocoon is thermally\ndominated in most cases. Jet launching is successful when the magnetic field\nhas a dipolar configuration and spin $a=0.9$, in contrast, a hybrid magnetic\nfield does not result in jet formation. We observe disk formation in cases\nwithout a magnetized jet, however, the formation of a well-defined funnel is\nnot evident and the expansion of such wind does not break the star for longer\ntimes. Our simulations show that a collapsar launches a successful,\nrelativistic jet only when a strong, large-scale dipolar field, driving a\nmagnetically arrested disk. Such jets collimate, accelerate, and break out of\nprogenitor stars in $1.5\\lesssim t\\lesssim3.5$ s, while weaker or\nnon-magnetised flows stall inside the star.

Although these approaches excel in capturing key biomolecular and\nphysiological features of the tumour, they are inherently indeterministic.

The model was developed by injecting a PpIX solution\ninto the cortical region of a resected adult rat brain, the injection site\nsimulated a tumoral region with elevated PpIX concentration. The tumoral region\nhad a gradient of concentrations, with a peak at the centre and a decrease\ntowards the margins, akin to in-vivo gliomas. The fluorescence profile was\ncompared to in-vivo conditions using 5-ALA and correlated well with other\nreported works, achieving a correlation of R2>0.93. The model's validity was\ntested by examining the effect of the solvent, DMSO, on the Autofluorescence\n(AF) of the brain sample and the short-term effect of storage on AF was\nanalysed. Examinations confirmed the solvent did not alter AF, and the brain\nsample should be stored in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution and refrigerated to\nmaintain moisture and preserve AF.

    "abstract": "Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in\ndetecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD\nsamples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space,\ncan still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like\ndiffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a\npotential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel\napproach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging\nOOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level\ndiscrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative\nin-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced,\nboundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise\nadjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score,\neffectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully\nsynthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label\nfeatures derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between\nnear-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark,\nwith minimal increases in parameters and runtime.

    "abstract": "When the gravitons are created thanks to the variation of the space-time\ncurvature the multiplicity distributions quantify the probability of producing\na given number of species around the average occupation numbers of the\nunderlying multiparticle states. The multiplicities of the relic gravitons are\ninfinitely divisible and their analytical expressions encompass, in different\nregions of the physical parameters, the Poisson, Bose-Einstein, Gamma and\nPascal probability distributions. Depending upon the post-inflationary\ntimelines, the averaged multiplicities are controlled by the range of the\ncomoving frequencies and they can be much larger in the GHz region than in the\naHz domain where the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the microwave\nbackground set strict limits on the spectral energy density of the relic\ngravitons. Thanks to the absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency of the\ngravitons we can acknowledge that the averaged multiplicities are exponentially\nsuppressed above the THz, where only few pairs of gravitons are independently\ncreated from the vacuum. The statistical properties of the produced particles\ncan be finally interpreted in the light of the second-order interference\neffects and this perspective is quantitatively scrutinized by analyzing the\nassociated quantum sensitivities. For putative instruments reaching spectral\namplitudes ${\\mathcal O}(10^{-35})/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ in the MHz or GHz bands,\nthe Bose-Einstein correlations could be used to probe the properties of cosmic\ngravitons and their super-Poissonian statistics.

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have\nworse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this\nproblem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them\nthrough gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant\nmodality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In\nthis work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and\nmodality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the\ncross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to\neach modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the\nperformance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the\nunimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)\nframework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality\nfusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient\nback-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces\nit with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient\nback-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This\nhelps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and\nmodality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.\nFinally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and\nframeworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and\nversatility of the proposed DGL.

Contention-based systems suffer badly in terms\nof latency when multiple devices compete for the same resources. Coordinated\nOrthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (Co-OFDMA) is proposed for Wi-Fi\n8 to remedy this, as it enables multiple Access Points (APs) to share spectrum\nmore efficiently. However, fine-grained resource allocation, namely within\n20MHz bandwidth, is argued to be impractical due to the over-the-air scheduling\noverhead and complexity in terms of physical layer signaling. A wired backhaul\nmitigates the need for over-the-air scheduling and synchronization, and it\nallows for coordination even if APs are not in each others' range. Furthermore,\nit forms the basis for more advanced multi-AP coordination schemes like\ncoordinated beamforming and joint transmission.

    "abstract": "Massive MIMO systems are moving toward increased numbers of radio frequency\nchains, higher carrier frequencies and larger bandwidths. As such,\ndigital-to-analog converters (DACs) are becoming a bottleneck in terms of\nhardware complexity and power consumption. In this work, non-linear precoding\nfor coarsely quantized downlink massive MIMO is studied. Given the NP-hard\nnature of this problem, a graph neural network (GNN) is proposed that directly\noutputs the precoded quantized vector based on the channel matrix and the\nintended transmit symbols. The model is trained in a self-supervised manner, by\ndirectly maximizing the achievable rate. To overcome the non-differentiability\nof the objective function, introduced due to the non-differentiable DAC\nfunctions, a straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimation of the gradient is\nproposed. The proposed method achieves a significant increase in achievable sum\nrate under coarse quantization. For instance, in the single-user case, the\nproposed method can achieve the same sum rate as maximum ratio transmission\n(MRT) by using one-bit DAC's as compared to 3 bits for MRT. This reduces the\nDAC's power consumption by a factor 4-7 and 3 for baseband and RF DACs\nrespectively. This, however, comes at the cost of increased digital signal\nprocessing power consumption. When accounting for this, the reduction in\noverall power consumption holds for a system bandwidth up to 3.5 MHz for\nbaseband DACs, while the RF DACs can maintain a power reduction of 2.9 for\nhigher bandwidths. Notably, indirect effects, which further reduce the power\nconsumption, such as a reduced fronthaul consumption and reduction in other\ncomponents, are not considered in this analysis.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may\nperform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue\nto imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through\ngradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not\nthe optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we\nprove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of\ntheir variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the\nAsymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning\nvia imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each\nmodality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates\ncoefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each\nmodality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to\nthe modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,\nARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly\noptimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share\nparameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality\nrepresentation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters\nand is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal\nmodel. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the\neffectiveness and versatility of ARL.

This constraint stems from the fact that\nMLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained\nimage encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images\ndirectly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution\ndiscrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring\nconsistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then\nPredict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework\ndesigned to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key\nintuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,\ntheir predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization\ncues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and\nthen predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively\npreserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by\nhigh-resolution data.

It\noutperformed state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational\nefficiency, requiring minimal CNN blocks per pipeline. SHAP analysis\ndemonstrated clinically interpretable feature contributions.\n  Conclusions: Our end-to-end framework delivers high-precision WCT\nclassification with minimal computational overhead. The integration of SHAP\nenhances clinical trust by elucidating decision logic, supporting rapid,\ninformed diagnosis. This approach shows significant promise for real-world ECG\nanalysis tools.",

Small scale\nsurface magnetic fields and multipolar components are believed to be\nresponsible for this complexity due to the radiation mechanisms occurring close\nto the stellar surface but within the relatively small light-cylinder compared\nto the stellar radius. In this work, we use the latest NICER phase aligned\nthermal X-ray pulse profile of PSR~J0740+6620 combined with radio and\n$\\gamma$-ray pulse profiles and radio polarisation to deduce the best magnetic\nfield configuration that can simultaneously reproduce the light-curves in these\nrespective bands.

We demonstrate that an almost centred dipole can\naccount for the hot spot location with a magnetic obliquity of $\\alpha \\approx\n51 \\deg$ and a line of sight inclination angle of $\\zeta \\approx 82 \\deg$.\nHowever, with this geometry, the hot spot areas are three times too large.

In this work, we examine the minimization of functions of\nthe form f(w) + a ||w||_1, where w are the material model parameters, f is a\nmetric that quantifies the mismatch between the material model and the observed\ndata, and a is a regularization parameter that determines the sparsity of the\nsolution.

Specifically, we present four algorithms and discuss\ntheir roles for automated material model discovery in mechanics: First, we\nrecapitulate a well-known coordinate descent algorithm that solves the\nminimization problem assuming that f is quadratic for a given value of a, also\nknown as the LASSO. Second, we discuss the algorithm LARS, which automatically\ndetermines the critical values of a, at which material parameters in w are set\nto zero.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified\ntext-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both\nimage and region levels.

Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level\nalignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their\ndescriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity.\nExtensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved\nstate-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets,\noutperforming existing methodologies.

Furthermore, identifying\nwhat visual features contribute to memory vulnerability presents a novel\nresearch question. Here, we propose a novel AI-driven framework that generates\nnaturalistic visual stimuli grounded in behaviorally relevant object dimensions\nto elicit similarity-induced memory biases. We use two types of stimuli --\nimage wheels created through dimension editing and dimension wheels generated\nby dimension activation values -- in three visual working memory (VWM)\nexperiments. These experiments assess memory distortions under three\nconditions: no perceptual comparison, perceptual comparison with image wheels,\nand perceptual comparison with dimension wheels. The results show that similar\ndimensions, like similar images, can also induce memory distortions.\nSpecifically, visual dimensions are more prone to distortion than semantic\ndimensions, indicating that the object dimensions of naturalistic visual\nstimuli play a significant role in the vulnerability of memory.",

The effect of\na broadband precipitating electron energy distribution, similar to the observed\nelectron distributions through particle measurements, on the conductance values\nis investigated. The new values are compared to the ones obtained from previous\nstudies, notably when considering a mono-energetic distribution. The broadband\nprecipitating electron energy distribution is modeled by a kappa distribution,\nwhich is used as an input in an electron transport model that computes the\ndensity vertical profiles of ionospheric ions. The vertical profiles of the\nPedersen and Hall conductivities are then evaluated assuming that the\nconductivities are mostly governed by the densities of H3+ and CH5+. Finally,\nthe Pedersen and Hall conductances are computed by integrating the\ncorresponding conductivities over altitude.

To address this challenge, we analyze the\nperformance characteristics of transformer and post-transformer LLMs. Despite\ntheir algorithmic differences, both are fundamentally limited by memory\nbandwidth under batched inference due to attention in transformers and state\nupdates in post-transformers.

Thirty-eight healthy adults were\nrandomly assigned to either an intervention group (n = 20), which completed two\nsessions spaced two weeks apart with daily breathing practice, or a control\ngroup (n = 18), which completed one session.

A significant reduction in\nGamma power was observed in the intervention group immediately following the\nfirst breathing session during mental load (p = .002), indicating acute stress\nreduction. Across sessions, long-term breathing practice led to increased Alpha\nand Delta power and reduced ST4 activity, suggesting cumulative improvements in\nemotional regulation and cognitive efficiency.

    "abstract": "In recent years, extensive work has explored the application of the\nTransformer architecture to reinforcement learning problems. Among these,\nDecision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of\noffline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned\npolicy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al.\n(2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based\noffline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative\nQ-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in\nsparse-reward and low-quality data settings.\n  In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks\n(Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered\nBehavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to\nDT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing\ntrajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on\nthe filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also\nrequires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results\ntherefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments.\nFrom prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward\nenvironments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?",

At the heart of their success lies the concept of\nTN ranks, which governs the efficiency and expressivity of TN decompositions.\nHowever, unlike matrix ranks, TN ranks often lack a universal meaning and an\nintuitive interpretation, with their properties varying significantly across\ndifferent TN structures. Consequently, TN ranks are frequently treated as\nempirically tuned hyperparameters, rather than as key design parameters\ninferred from domain knowledge. The aim of this Lecture Note is therefore to\ndemystify the foundational yet frequently misunderstood concept of TN ranks\nthrough real-life examples and intuitive visualizations. We begin by\nillustrating how domain knowledge can guide the selection of TN ranks in\nwidely-used models such as the Canonical Polyadic (CP) and Tucker\ndecompositions. For more complex TN structures, we employ a self-explanatory\ngraphical approach that generalizes to tensors of arbitrary order. Such a\nperspective naturally reveals the relationship between TN ranks and the\ncorresponding ranks of tensor unfoldings (matrices), thereby circumventing\ncumbersome multi-index tensor algebra while facilitating domain-informed TN\ndesign. It is our hope that this Lecture Note will equip readers with a clear\nand unified understanding of the concept of TN rank, along with the necessary\nphysical insight and intuition to support the selection, explainability, and\ndeployment of tensor methods in both practical applications and educational\ncontexts.",

    "abstract": "Gravitational-wave (GW) detection offers a novel approach to exploring\nintermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). The GW signals from IMBH mergers mainly\nfall in the decihertz frequency band. The lunar-based GW detector, the Lunar\nGravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), exhibits high sensitivity in this band,\nmaking it particularly well-suited for detecting IMBHs. However, for lower-mass\nIMBHs, the late inspiral and merger signals enter the sensitive frequency range\nof ground-based GW detectors. In this work, we aim to explore how multi-band\nobservations with LGWA and the third-generation ground-based GW detector, the\nEinstein Telescope (ET), can contribute to detecting the population of IMBHs.\nWe consider three population distribution cases of IMBHs, including two\npopulation models based on astrophysical motivations and a uniform\ndistribution, and compute the signal-to-noise ratios for LGWA, ET, and their\ncombination to directly compare their capabilities in detecting IMBH mergers.\nOur results suggest that LGWA possesses strong detection capability for\nhigh-mass IMBH mergers. At redshift $z = 1$, LGWA's detection rate for IMBH\nbinaries with primary masses above $5 \\times 10^4~M_\\odot$ is largely\ninsensitive to orbital inclination and mass ratio. In contrast, ET is more\nsuited for detecting IMBH binaries with primary masses below $10^3~M_\\odot$.\nThe multi-band observation of LGWA and ET possesses strong detection\ncapabilities across the full IMBH mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the\nmulti-band detection can significantly and effectively recover the IMBH\npopulation distributions. In summary, we conclude that the multi-band\nobservations of LGWA and ET will provide powerful detection capabilities for\nIMBHs and are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of this\nimportant yet still poorly observed class of black holes.",

    "abstract": "AI has driven significant progress in the nutrition field, especially through\nmultimedia-based automatic dietary assessment. However, existing automatic\ndietary assessment systems often overlook critical non-visual factors, such as\nrecipe-specific ingredient substitutions that can significantly alter\nnutritional content, and rarely account for individual dietary needs, including\nallergies, restrictions, cultural practices, and personal preferences. In\nSwitzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains\nfragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant\nnutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we\nintroduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our\nbest knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with\nnutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national\nnutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment\npipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first\nbenchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge\naugmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the\ngraph with relevant nutritional information. Our SwissFKG goes beyond recipe\nrecommendations by offering ingredient-level information such as allergen and\ndietary restriction information, and guidance aligned with nutritional\nguidelines. Moreover, we implement a Graph-RAG application to showcase how the\nSwissFKG's rich natural-language data structure can help LLM answer\nuser-specific nutrition queries, and we evaluate LLM-embedding pairings by\ncomparing user-query responses against predefined expected answers. As such,\nour work lays the foundation for the next generation of dietary assessment\ntools that blend visual, contextual, and cultural dimensions of eating.",

A common solution to this\nproblem involves training a linear projector to align their feature spaces, but\nthis introduces additional parameters that must be learned from scratch and\noften degrades performance on downstream tasks, especially in generative\nsettings. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel task-based\nfeature distillation method that enables knowledge transfer between teacher and\nstudent models with different hidden layer dimensions, without introducing any\nnew parameters. Leveraging the insight that only a subset of LLM components\ncontribute significantly to a specific downstream task, our approach identifies\nthe most task-relevant hidden units in the teacher and directly distills their\nactivations to the student.

We prove that each of these two constraints\nmakes the problem \\mbox{$\\mathcal{NP}$-hard}, and hence we design a simple\niterative approach based on integer linear programming that allows us to solve\nreal-life instances even using an open-source integer linear programming\nsolver. Another advantage of this approach is that it mitigates numerical\nissues, caused by the extensive range of data values, we experienced with a\ncommercial solver.

Nowadays, intense laser-atom interactions are\none of the primary sources of high-order harmonic generation, emitting\nradiation in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) range. Although the scaling laws for\nXUV photon numbers have been extensively studied in the past, their dependence\non the duration of the driving laser pulse has remained largely unexplored\nexperimentally. This is because, in each of these studies, the XUV photon yield\nwas optimized according to the specific characteristics of the lasers used and\nthe corresponding XUV beamlines. In other words, there have been no systematic\nmeasurements on the dependence of XUV yield on the duration of the driving\nlaser pulse. Here, by taking advantage of the SYLOS laser system at ELI ALPS,\nwe are able to experimentally investigate this long-standing question. We found\nthat for driving laser field intensities below the saturation threshold of\nharmonic generation, the harmonic yield depends linearly on the pulse duration.\nHowever, for laser intensities near to the harmonic yield saturation, the\nharmonic yield is inversely proportional to the pulse duration.",

The effectiveness of continuous batching relies\non an accurate estimate of the memory requirements of requests.

Consequently, they\nsuffer from harmful request evictions or prolonged queuing times, failing to\nachieve satisfactory throughput under strict Service Level Agreement (SLA)\nguarantees (a.k.a. goodput), across various LLM application scenarios with\ndiffering input-output length distributions.

It adapts to applications with all types of input-output\nlength distributions, balancing the trade-off between request queuing and\nharmful evictions, thereby consistently achieving better goodput. Furthermore,\nto validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduler, we developed a\nhigh-performance LLM serving framework, LightLLM, that implements the\nPast-Future scheduler.

To better capture and assess this capacity for\nadjustment, we introduce the concept of \\textit{adaptability} as a unified and\npractically grounded lens through which to evaluate the reliability of MARL\nalgorithms under shifting conditions, broadly referring to any changes in the\nenvironment dynamics that may occur during learning or execution. Centred on\nthe notion of adaptability, we propose a structured framework comprising three\nkey dimensions: learning adaptability, policy adaptability, and scenario-driven\nadaptability. By adopting this adaptability perspective, we aim to support more\nprincipled assessments of MARL performance beyond narrowly defined benchmarks.\nUltimately, this survey contributes to the development of algorithms that are\nbetter suited for deployment in dynamic, real-world multi-agent systems.",

One of the key elements for understanding how to design\na system for a particular interface is understanding how users browse. For\ncarousels, users may browse in a number of different ways due to the added\ncomplexity of multiple topic defined-lists and swiping to see more items.\n  Eye tracking is the key to understanding user behavior by providing valuable,\ndirect information on how users see and navigate. In this work, we provide the\nfirst extensive analysis of the eye tracking behavior in carousel recommenders\nunder the free-browsing setting. To understand how users browse, we examine the\nfollowing research questions : 1) where do users start browsing, 2) how do\nusers transition from item to item within the same carousel and across\ncarousels, and 3) how does genre preference impact transitions?\n  This work addresses a gap in the field and provides the first extensive\nempirical results of eye tracked browsing behavior in carousels for improving\nrecommenders. Taking into account the insights learned from the above\nquestions, our final contribution is to provide suggestions to help carousel\nrecommender system designers optimize their systems for user browsing behavior.\nThe most important suggestion being to reorder the ranked item positions to\naccount for browsing after swiping.These contributions aim not only to help\nimprove current systems, but also to encourage and allow the design of new user\nmodels, systems, and metrics that are better suited to the complexity of\ncarousel interfaces.",

While\ntraditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate\ncardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored\nin this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA)\npoint tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography.\nAlthough these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general\nvideos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain\nlimited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode\nultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different\nviews is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we\nrefine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations\nto reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through\nimpartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging\nmulti-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced\nspatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning\nwith our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their\nbaselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases.

The problem admits a\n$2$-approximation algorithm and no better approximation ratio is known.\nHershkowitz, Klein, and Zenklusen [STOC 24] gave a bicriteria\n$(1,k-10)$-approximation algorithm that computes a $(k-10)$-edge-connected\nspanning subgraph of cost at most the optimal value of a standard Cut-LP for\n$k$-ECSS. This LP bicriteria approximation was recently improved by Cohen and\nNutov [ESA 25] to $(1,k-4)$, where also was given a bicriteria approximation\n$(3/2,k-2)$. In this paper we improve the bicriteria approximation to $(1,k-2)$\nfor $k$ even and to $\\left(1-\\frac{1}{k},k-3\\right)$ for $k$ is odd, and also\ngive another bicriteria approximation $(3/2,k-1)$. After this paper was\nwritten, we became aware that the same result was achieved earlier by Kumar and\nSwamy.\n  The $k$-Edge-Connected Spanning Multi-subgraph ($k$-ECSM) problem is almost\nthe same as $k$-ECSS, except that any edge can be selected multiple times at\nthe same cost. The previous best approximation ratio for $k$-ECSM was $1+4/k$.\nOur result improves this to $1+\\frac{2}{k}$ for $k$ even and to $1+\\frac{3}{k}$\nfor $k$ odd, where for $k$ odd the computed subgraph is in fact\n$(k+1)$-edge-connected.",

    "abstract": "Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing. Because they are still in development,\nwhat is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies\nfor debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for\ndebiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they\nincorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge\ninto awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of\ninformation contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and\ncontradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if\nprompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making\nliterature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show\npromise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is \"could you be wrong?\"\nFollowing an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional\ninformation, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,\ncontradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their\ninitial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and\nusers interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a\nset of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including\nimplicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. \"Could you be\nwrong\" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent\nmetacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing\nbut incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive\nprompt. In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for\nprompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based\nimprovements to human decision making.",

Our work starts with decomposing the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming\n(MILP) problem into a series of Linear Programming (LP) formulations. For power\ngrids with sufficiently large generation capacity or tree topologies, we derive\nanalytical cost expressions demonstrating that, under reasonable assumptions,\nthe weighted degree is the only topological factor for optimal battery\nplacement. We also discuss the minor impact of higher-order topological\nconditions on tree-topology networks. To find the localized nature of a single\nbattery's impact, we establish that the relative cost-saving benefit of a\nsingle battery decreases as the network scales. Furthermore, we design a\nlow-complexity algorithm for weakly-cyclic networks.

Amongst the data from the Rosetta\nPlasma Consortium (RPC) suite of instruments are measurements of the total\nelectron density from the Mutual Impedance Probe (MIP) and Langmuir Probe\n(LAP).\n  At low outgassing, the plasma density measurements can be explained by a\nsimple balance between the production through ionisation and loss through\ntransport. Ions are assumed to travel radially at the outflow speed of the\nneutral gas. Near perihelion, the assumptions of this field-free chemistry-free\nmodel are no longer valid, and plasma density is overestimated. This can be\nexplained by enhanced ion transport by an ambipolar electric field inside the\ndiamagnetic cavity, where the interplanetary magnetic field does not reach.\n  In this study, we explore the transition between these two regimes, at\nintermediate outgassing ($5.4 \\times10^{26}~\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$), when the\ninteraction between the cometary and solar wind plasma influences the transport\nof the ions. We use a 3D collisional test-particle model, adapted from\nStephenson et al. 2022 to model the cometary ions with input electric and\nmagnetic fields from a hybrid simulation for 2.5-3 au. The total plasma density\nfrom this model is then compared to data from MIP/LAP and to the field-free\nchemistry-free model. In doing so, we highlight the limitations of the hybrid\napproach and demonstrate the importance of modelling collisional cooling of the\nelectrons to understand the ion dynamics close to the nucleus.",

The CRP-CC approach is\nformally similar to implicit solvation CC models and provides access to the\nCBO-CC electronic ground state energy minimized in cavity coordinate space on a\nCC level of theory. A hierarchy of linearisation schemes (lCRP-CCSD) similar to\ncanonical CC theory systematically lifts the self-consistent nature of the\nCRP-CCSD approach and mitigates numerical cost by approximating electron\ncorrelation effects in energy minimization. We provide a thorough comparison of\nCRP-CCSD, lCRP-CCSD and CRP-Hartee-Fock methods for a cavity-modified\nMenshutkin reaction, pyridine$+$CH$_3$Br, and cavity-induced collective\nelectronic effects in microsolvation energies of selected methanol-water\nclusters.

Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge\nlearned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning\nstrategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and\nsemantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical\ntime series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to\nachieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly\ntrained on TSF data.

    "abstract": "The integration of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with Artificial\nIntelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) offers new opportunities for smart\nmanufacturing, but it also introduces challenges related to\ncomputation-intensive tasks and low-latency demands. Traditional generative\nmodels based on cloud computing are difficult to meet the real-time\nrequirements of AIGC tasks in IIoT environments, and edge computing can\neffectively reduce latency through task offloading. However, the dynamic nature\nof AIGC tasks, model switching delays, and resource constraints impose higher\ndemands on edge computing environments. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes an AIGC task offloading framework tailored for IIoT edge computing\nenvironments, considering the latency and energy consumption caused by AIGC\nmodel switching for the first time. IIoT devices acted as multi-agent\ncollaboratively offload their dynamic AIGC tasks to the most appropriate edge\nservers deployed with different generative models. A model aware AIGC task\noffloading algorithm based on Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient\n(MADDPG-MATO) is devised to minimize the latency and energy. Experimental\nresults show that MADDPG-MATO outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an\naverage reduction of 6.98% in latency, 7.12% in energy consumption, and a 3.72%\nincrease in task completion rate across four sets of experiments with model\nnumbers ranging from 3 to 6, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is\nrobust and efficient in dynamic, high-load IIoT environments.",

We aim to\ndetermine whether analysis methods directly contribute to this discrepancy and\nto assess how methodological improvements might reduce or clarify it. To\naddress this, we developed a new self-contained framework that simultaneously\nmodels the photometric and spectroscopic data, minimising biases introduced by\ntraditional iterative approaches and enabling consistent parameter\noptimisation. We present this framework alongside validation tests on synthetic\ndata and demonstrate its application to three well-studied observed binaries,\nincluding one system known for its pronounced mass discrepancy. The framework\nrecovers multiple viable solutions from distinct local minima, including one\nthat reduces the mass discrepancy. These results illustrate how methodological\nbiases, rather than evolutionary model assumptions, can contribute to the mass\ndiscrepancy problem. We further highlight that external constraints, such as\nindependent distance estimates or evolutionary models, may be necessary to\ndistinguish between degenerate solutions. Expanding this analysis to a larger\nsample will provide a more complete understanding, with forthcoming results in\nthe next paper in this series.",

Participants also rated their stress and anxiety using a modified\nState-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). EEG analysis focused on frequency bands\n(Theta, Gamma, Delta) and machine-learning-derived features (A0, ST4, VC9, T2).\nA double dissociation emerged: Theta and VC9 increased under cognitive load but\nnot startle, supporting their sensitivity to executive function. In contrast,\nGamma and A0 were elevated by the startle stimulus, consistent with stress\nreactivity. ST4 tracked cognitive effort and worry, while T2 negatively\ncorrelated with self-reported calmness, indicating relevance to emotional\nregulation.

    "abstract": "Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT), a recently proposed Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) method, has attracted widespread attention for significantly\nimproving parameter efficiency by editing representation space alone. In this\nwork, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However,\ndirectly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at\nthe beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these\nfixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe\nthat, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical\nrepresentations. These representations either integrate significant information\nfrom preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through\nlayer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final\noutput. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential\nto greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we\npropose Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT), a novel method that\nidentifies and optimizes these critical representations through information\nflow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework,\ndynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace\nwhile freezing the base model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method\nare validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning,\nusing LLaMA and Mistral model families. Furthermore, our method also adapts\neffectively to few-shot settings, boosting one-shot accuracy by 16.4%. Our work\nhighlights the untapped potential of representation-level optimization for CoT\nreasoning, offering a lightweight yet powerful alternative to traditional PEFT\nmethods.",

While post-training safety alignment methods have been widely\nadopted, LLMs remain vulnerable to malicious instructions that can bypass\nsafety constraints. Recent efforts have introduced inference-time safety\nreasoning (system-2 alignment), where LLMs conduct a reasoning process to\nperform safety verification before final response. We show, however, that these\nchecks are driven by ad-hoc reasoning that diverges from the structured human\nprocess, where they first discern a user's true intent, then evaluate the\nassociated risk based on the true intent. Consequently, these defenses remain\nvulnerable to sophisticated jailbreak prompts that cloak harmful goals in\nseemingly benign language. To build secure and safe LLMs, we propose a\nreasoning-based safety alignment framework, ARMOR, that replaces the ad-hoc\nchains of thought reasoning process with human-aligned, structured one. At\ninference, ARMOR (1) detects likely jailbreak strategies, (2) extracts the\nuser's core intent while discarding deceptive instructions, and (3) applies a\npolicy-grounded safety analysis to the purified request. ARMOR is evaluated on\nadaptive jailbreak attacks and multiple safety benchmarks, and a test-time\nscaling is conducted to further improve its performance. Results demonstrate\nthat ARMOR significantly enhances the robustness against state-of-the-art\nadaptive jailbreak attacks and outperforms recent reasoning-based aligned\nmodels across various safety benchmarks.",

To address these challenges, we present FlashANNS, a GPU-accelerated\nout-of-core graph-based ANNS system through I/O-compute overlapping. Our core\ninsight lies in the synchronized orchestration of I/O and computation through\nthree key innovations: 1) Dependency-Relaxed asynchronous pipeline: FlashANNS\ndecouples I/O-computation dependencies to fully overlap between GPU distance\ncalculations and SSD data transfers. 2) Warp-Level concurrent SSD access:\nFlashANNS implements a lock-free I/O stack with warp-level concurrency control,\nto reduce the latency-induced time overhead. 3) Computation-I/O balanced graph\ndegree Selection: FlashANNS selects graph degrees via lightweight\ncompute-to-I/O ratio sampling, ensuring optimal balance between computational\nload and storage access latency across different I/O bandwidth configurations.\nWe implement FlashANNS and compare it with state-of-the-art out-of-core ANNS\nsystems (SPANN, DiskANN) and a GPU-accelerated out-of-core ANNS system\n(FusionANNS).

Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge.\nCurrent tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between\nmixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference\nstages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and poor\nresource utilization. To address this, we introduce Elastic Multimodal\nParallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource\nheterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we\ndevelop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into\nindependent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a\nmodality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables\nparallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling;\nand (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching\nand non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that\nElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by\nup to 4.2x and achieving 3.2-4.5x higher throughput while meeting service-level\nobjectives (SLOs).",

An effective spatial\nresolution of 1 mm was achieved at a planar field measurement speed of 200 Hz\nand a volumetric field measurement speed of 2 Hz, with further improvements in\nspeed anticipated by another order of magnitude. A physically constrained\nnonlinear inference framework was also developed for the quantitative analysis\nof the measurement data.

Motion of particles within optical\ntweezer traps established itself as a probe for local viscosity, temperature as\nwell as external fields. However, complex motions of trapped particles such as\nhopping or orbiting conventionally relies on intricate structure of the optical\ntrap, which creates limitations to their applicability, in particular in\nchallenging environments such as living matter. Here we demonstrate\nexperimentally polarization-dependent hopping and orbiting of particles in an\noptical trap formed by a single Gaussian beam. This novel effect is observed\nfor subwavelength particles with sizes above approximately $\\lambda/3$, where\n$\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the trapping beam. Our theoretical analysis\nreveals that the hopping and orbiting arises via the excitation of {\\it\nhigher-order Mie resonances}. While smaller particles experiencing dipolar\noptical forces remain trapped at the beam center, larger particles experience\nquadrupole optical forces exhibiting more complex behavior. Under linearly\npolarized illumination, larger particles show {\\it bistable dynamics} hopping\nbetween two stable positions. Under circularly polarized illumination, trapped\nparticles orbit around the beam center, revealing a light-induced\nspin-to-orbital angular momentum transfer. Experimental trajectory analysis\nreveals power-tunable hopping rates and angular velocities. We discuss the\neffect of VO$_2$ monoclinic-to-rutile phase change on the observed effect.

We evaluate three open-source 7B-parameter models (Qwen2, Mistral,\nGemma) using static analysis to assess both the presence and correctness of\ngenerated vulnerabilities.

While recent efforts have explored adapting large language\nmodels (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture\none-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer\nspatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In\nthis paper, we present \\textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically\nreprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal\nforecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise\nwhen applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling\ncapacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,\nST-VFM adopts a \\emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs\nwith auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal\ndifference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively\nprocess these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming\nstages. The \\emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token\nAdapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible\nfeature spaces. The \\emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral\nCross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches\nthrough prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning\nwithout modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten\nspatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones\n(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong\ngeneral framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.",

Excessive investment herding may\nreduce investments and lead to a depletion of household consumption, which is\ncalled the crowding-out effect. While existing research has qualitatively\nexamined the impact of investment herding on consumption, quantitative studies\nin this area remain limited. In this work, we investigate the optimal\ninvestment and consumption decisions of households under the impact of\ninvestment herding. We formulate an optimization problem to model how\ninvestment herding influences household decisions over time. Based on the\noptimal control theory, we solve for the analytical solutions of optimal\ninvestment and consumption decisions. We theoretically analyze the impact of\ninvestment herding on household consumption decisions and demonstrate the\nexistence of the crowding-out effect. We further explore how parameters, such\nas interest rate, excess return rate, and volatility, influence the\ncrowding-out effect. Finally, we conduct a real data test to validate our\ntheoretical analysis of the crowding-out effect.

We improve the extended\nlinear sigma model with baryons, proposed in our previous work, by introducing\nthe flavor structures constructed from antisymmetric tensors of chiral\nrepresentations to study these physics. The parameter space of this model is\nrefined with well-reproduced nuclear matter properties at saturation density by\nthe lowest order Lagrangian, ensuring consistency with vacuum results, such as\n$f_\\pi \\approx 134 \\, \\text{MeV}$. The anticipated plateau-like behaviors of\nthe symmetry energy are predicted at intermediate densities, which is crucial\nfor the consistency of GW170817 and the neutron skin thickness of\n$\\text{Pb}^{208}$. Subsequently, neutron star structures are calculated using\nseveral parameter sets, and the results for the nuclear matter properties at\nsaturation density align with empirical values. It is found that the neutron\nstar structures are sensitive to the couplings between the iso-vector $a_0$\nmeson and nucleons and the four-vector meson couplings: small values of both\nare favorable. Meanwhile, nuclear matter properties at saturation density favor\nlarger values of the latter and are not sensitive to the former. This signifies\nthe statistical significance of neutron star observations when obtaining\nrealistic chiral effective field theories or models at various densities. The\nparameter set favored by neutron star observations also aligns the behavior of\nthe sound velocity with the conformal limit at high densities relevant to cores\nof massive stars.

It accurately reproduces the known SHARK stellar masses\nwith respective root-mean-square and median errors of only 0.085 and 0.1 dex\nover the three decades in stellar mass. Analysis of the trained network's\nparameters reveals several colour indices to be particularly effective\npredictors of stellar mass.

However,\nprevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training\ninstability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty\nmismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's\ncurrent capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled\nlearning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more\nresource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid\nPolicy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning\nframework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive\nprompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively\nbalances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's\nreach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks,\neffectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of\napproximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently\noutperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning\nbaselines.

To this end, we propose a selective\noptimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on\nlow-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution\nimages (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As\nobserved in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to\ntarget-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to\nresolution mismatch.

By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for\neffective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural\nconsistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To\nmaximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware\nprobabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization\nstrategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting\nfrom BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while\nensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive\nperformance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable,\nhigh-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.",

In\nthis work, a novel solution algorithm for multi-scale and non-equilibrium flow\ntransport under an external force is developed based on the Boltzmann-BGK\nequation. The core innovation lies in the fusion of the Hermite spectral method\n(employed to characterize non-equilibrium particle distributions) with a\nmulti-scale evolution model (sourced from the unified gas-kinetic scheme),\nachieving a seamless connection between computational methods and physical\nmodels. To accommodate the properties of the spectral-collocation method, a\nseries of collocation points and weights are adapted based on the Gauss-Hermite\nquadrature. As a result, the computational efficiency of the solution algorithm\nis significantly improved (up to 50 times) while maintaining comparable\naccuracy as the classical discrete velocity method. It is demonstrated that the\nsolution algorithm effectively preserves the key structural features of\ngas-dynamic systems subjected to an external force, e.g., the well-balanced\nproperty.

The analysis is further\nextended to the 1D and 2D long-range Heisenberg models, where we find the\nEnLRO-ReLRO crossover at $\\sigma \\approx 1.575$ and $\\sigma \\approx 3.22$,\nrespectively. The similar crossover points suggest that the distinction between\nEnLRO and ReLRO regimes is a generic feature in continuous spin models with\nlong-range interactions.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between two entities often occur at specific timestamps, which\ncan be modeled as a temporal graph. Exploring the relationships between\nvertices based on temporal paths is one of the fundamental tasks. In this\npaper, we conduct the first research to propose and investigate the problem of\ngenerating the temporal simple path graph (tspG), which is the subgraph\nconsisting of all temporal simple paths from the source vertex to the target\nvertex within the given time interval. Directly enumerating all temporal simple\npaths and constructing the tspG is computationally expensive. To accelerate the\nprocessing, we propose an efficient method named Verification in Upper-bound\nGraph. It first incorporates the temporal path constraint and simple path\nconstraint to exclude unpromising edges from the original graph, which obtains\na tight upper-bound graph as a high-quality approximation of the tspG in\npolynomial time. Then, an Escape Edges Verification algorithm is further\napplied in the upper-bound graph to construct the exact tspG without\nexhaustively enumerating all temporal simple paths between given vertices.\nFinally, comprehensive experiments on 10 real-world graphs are conducted to\ndemonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed techniques.",

This\ncapability poses a significant threat, as audio can be covertly captured\nwithout direct interaction or visibility. Moreover, compared to images and\ntext, audio carries unique characteristics, such as tone and pitch, which can\nbe exploited for more detailed profiling. However, two key challenges exist in\nunderstanding MLLM-employed private attribute profiling from audio: (1) the\nlack of audio benchmark datasets with sensitive attribute annotations and (2)\nthe limited ability of current MLLMs to infer such attributes directly from\naudio. To address these challenges, we introduce AP^2, an audio benchmark\ndataset that consists of two subsets collected and composed from real-world\ndata, and both are annotated with sensitive attribute labels. Additionally, we\npropose Gifts, a hybrid multi-agent framework that leverages the complementary\nstrengths of audio-language models (ALMs) and large language models (LLMs) to\nenhance inference capabilities. Gifts employs an LLM to guide the ALM in\ninferring sensitive attributes, then forensically analyzes and consolidates the\nALM's inferences, overcoming severe hallucinations of existing ALMs in\ngenerating long-context responses. Our evaluations demonstrate that Gifts\nsignificantly outperforms baseline approaches in inferring sensitive\nattributes. Finally, we investigate model-level and data-level defense\nstrategies to mitigate the risks of audio private attribute profiling.

One well-studied test case in this domain is the\nbouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like \"bouba\"\nwith round shapes and \"kiki\" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found\nin prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive\nre-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer\n(ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two\ncomplementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based\nevaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as\na novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our\nfindings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki\neffect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance\nacross both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison\nwith prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall\nmarkedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of\nhuman cognition.

As\nelectric power systems are becoming more complex, traditional protection\nmethods face limitations and shortcomings. Faults in power systems can occur at\nanytime and anywhere, can be caused by a natural disaster or an accident, and\ntheir occurrence can be hardly predicted or avoided; therefore, it is crucial\nto accurately estimate the fault location and quickly restore service. The\ndevelopment of methods capable of accurately detecting, locating and removing\nfaults is essential (i.e. fast isolation of faults is necessary to maintain the\nsystem stability at transmission levels; accurate and fast detection and\nlocation of faults are essential for increasing reliability and customer\nsatisfaction at distribution levels).

This approach exponentially reduces the\nmotion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its\nefficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation\ndue to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations.\nInspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation\n(I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase\nframes, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image\nsequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both\nlimitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show\nthat 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error\nwhile achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate\nequals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high\npixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the\ncomputational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the\ncomputational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster\nmotion error convergence.",

A technical advantage\nof MgAl2O4 is that a continuous and flat thin film is realized on a Si\nsubstrate even when the MgAl2O4 thickness is as thin as 0.5 nm, unlike MgO,\nwhich enables us to examine the spin transport in a thinner range of the tunnel\nbarrier thickness.

    "abstract": "A broad range of applications involve signals with irregular structures that\ncan be represented as a graph. As the underlying structures can change over\ntime, the tracking dynamic graph topologies from observed signals is a\nfundamental challenge in graph signal processing (GSP), with applications in\nvarious domains, such as power systems, the brain-machine interface, and\ncommunication systems. In this paper, we propose a method for tracking dynamic\nchanges in graph topologies. Our approach builds on a representation of the\ndynamics as a graph-based nonlinear state-space model (SSM), where the\nobservations are graph signals generated through graph filtering, and the\nunderlying evolving topology serves as the latent states. In our formulation,\nthe graph Laplacian matrix is parameterized using the incidence matrix and edge\nweights, enabling a structured representation of the state. In order to track\nthe evolving topology in the resulting SSM, we develop a sparsity-aware\nextended Kalman filter (EKF) that integrates $\\ell_1$-regularized updates\nwithin the filtering process. Furthermore, a dynamic programming scheme to\nefficiently compute the Jacobian of the graph filter is introduced.

Recent studies have attempted to integrate them\nvia multimodal knowledge graphs (MKGs) to further enhance recommendation\nperformance. However, existing methods typically freeze the MKG structure\nduring training, which limits the full integration of structural information\nfrom heterogeneous graphs (e.g., KG and user-item interaction graph), and\nresults in sub-optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel framework, termed Self-loop Iterative Fusion of Heterogeneous Auxiliary\nInformation for Multimodal Recommendation (SLIF-MR), which leverages item\nrepresentations from previous training epoch as feedback signals to dynamically\noptimize the heterogeneous graph structures composed of KG, multimodal item\nfeature graph, and user-item interaction graph. Through this iterative fusion\nmechanism, both user and item representations are refined, thus improving the\nfinal recommendation performance. Specifically, based on the feedback item\nrepresentations, SLIF-MR constructs an item-item correlation graph, then\nintegrated into the establishment process of heterogeneous graphs as additional\nnew structural information in a self-loop manner. Consequently, the internal\nstructures of heterogeneous graphs are updated with the feedback item\nrepresentations during training. Moreover, a semantic consistency learning\nstrategy is proposed to align heterogeneous item representations across\nmodalities.

Our\nexperiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update\nscheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to\nachieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and\nParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG)\nalgorithm.

    "abstract": "As we approach the centennial anniversary of modern quantum mechanics this\npaper revisits the foundational debates through a new poll within the research\ncommunity. Inspired by the survey by Schlosshauer, Kofler, and Zeilinger at the\nspecialized 2011 Quantum Physics and the Nature of Reality conference, we\nexpanded our recruitment to include a more representative sample of the broader\ncommunity of physicists with the aim to reveal potential shifts in scientists'\nviews and compare our findings with those from several previous polls. While\nquantum foundations still lack a consensus interpretation, our results indicate\na persistent preference for the Copenhagen interpretation. This enduring\nsupport likely reflects both the educational emphasis on the Copenhagen\ninterpretation and its pragmatic appeal in avoiding complex metaphysical\nquestions and introducing new notions (e.g., other worlds or the pilot wave).\nOur findings thus underscore the relative stability of interpretational\npreferences over the past decades.",

While large $\\theta$ values introduce substantial noise in the\nreleased degree sequence, small $\\theta$ values result in more edges removed\nthan necessary.

While its analysis can reveal short-term health impacts of climate\nextremes and enable more timely mortality forecasts, its complex temporal\nstructure poses significant challenges to traditional mortality models. To\nleverage the power of high-frequency mortality data, this paper introduces a\nnovel integration of gradient boosting techniques into traditional stochastic\nmortality models under a multi-population setting. Our key innovation lies in\nusing the Li and Lee model as the weak learner within the gradient boosting\nframework, replacing conventional decision trees. Empirical studies are\nconducted using weekly mortality data from 30 countries (Human Mortality\nDatabase, 2015--2019). The proposed methodology not only enhances model fit by\naccurately capturing underlying mortality trends and seasonal patterns, but\nalso achieves superior forecast accuracy, compared to the benchmark models. We\nalso investigate a key challenge in multi-population mortality modelling: how\nto select appropriate sub-populations with sufficiently similar mortality\nexperiences. A comprehensive clustering exercise is conducted based on\nmortality improvement rates and seasonal strength. The results demonstrate the\nrobustness of our proposed model, yielding stable forecast accuracy under\ndifferent clustering configurations.",

Extensive experiments on the WyScout Open Access Dataset, a\nlarge-scale real-world soccer dataset, demonstrate that HIGFormer significantly\noutperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy.

Notably, narrow beam widths allow electrons to reach higher energy\nlevels more efficiently than broader beams, highlighting the spatial\nlocalization of the nonlinear interactions to regions where the field is strong\nand frequency mismatch is small. Our findings show that in devices with\nlower-frequency ECR systems, such as TCV (82.7 GHz), electrons can gain up to\n800 eV, while higher-frequency devices, like ASDEX-Upgrade (140 GHz) and ITER\n(170 GHz), achieve lower energy gains (480 eV and 420 eV, respectively) under\nsimilar conditions. These insights are directly applicable to improving ECR\nheating strategies, informing design choices in future fusion devices to\noptimize energy transfer during plasma breakdown and startup.",

In this scenario, supernova ejecta of a\nstripped-envelope star impacts a close-by stellar companion, temporarily\ninflating the envelope. The expanded envelope engulfs the neutron star, causing\nstrong mass accretion at super-Eddington rates. Feedback from the accretion\npowers the supernova light curve with periodic undulations. Our simulations\ncapture key features of SN2022jli, both the overall decline and the\nsuperimposed undulations of the light curve. Based on our parameter study, we\nfind that (i) the accretion feedback should be sufficiently geometrically\nconfined and the eccentricity of the post-supernova binary orbit should be\n$0.7\\lesssim e\\lesssim0.9$ to sustain a high accretion rate, and (ii) the\nviewing angle should be close to edge-on to match the low undulation amplitude\n($\\Delta L/L\\sim0.1$) of SN2022jli. Different combinations of parameters could\naccount for other supernovae like SN2022mop, SN2009ip and SN2015ap. We also\ndiscuss possible explanations for other key features of SN2022jli such as the\n$\\gamma$-ray detection at $\\sim200~\\mathrm{d}$ and the rapid optical drop at\n$\\sim250~\\mathrm{d}$. Finally, we speculate on the future evolution of the\nsystem and its relation to existing neutron star binaries.",

However, studies of protoclusters at these high redshifts\nremain limited, primarily due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous selection\ncriteria. In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation of the star\nformation and cold gas properties of member galaxies of eight massive\nprotoclusters in the COSMOS field, using the statistical and homogeneously\nselected sample from the Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE). Our analysis\nreveals a steep increase in the star formation rates per halo mass\n($\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR} /M_{\\rm halo}$) with redshifts in these intensively\nstar-forming protoclusters, reaching values one to two orders of magnitude\nhigher than those observed in the field at z>2. We further show that, instead\nof an enhancement of starbursts, this increase is largely driven by the\nconcentration of massive and gas-rich star-forming galaxies in the protocluster\ncores. The member galaxies still generally follow the same star formation main\nsequence as in the field, with a moderate enhancement at the low mass end.\nNotably, the most massive protocluster galaxies\n($M_\\star$>8$\\times$10$^{10}$M$_\\odot$) exhibit higher $f_{\\rm gas}$ and\n$\\tau_{\\rm gas}$ than their field counterparts, while remaining on the star\nforming main sequence.

However,\nits application in the ranking stage, especially when richer contextual\ninformation in user-item interactions is available, remains underexplored. A\nmajor challenge lies in the substantial computational cost associated with\nrepeatedly retrieving neighborhood information from billions of items stored in\ndistributed systems. This resource-intensive requirement makes it difficult to\nscale graph-based methods in practical RecSys. To bridge this gap, we first\ndemonstrate that incorporating graphs in the ranking stage improves ranking\nqualities. Notably, while the improvement is evident, we show that the\nsubstantial computational overheads entailed by graphs are prohibitively\nexpensive for real-world recommendations. In light of this, we propose a\nnon-parametric strategy that utilizes graph convolution for re-ranking only\nduring test time. Our strategy circumvents the notorious computational\noverheads from graph convolution during training, and utilizes structural\nknowledge hidden in graphs on-the-fly during testing. It can be used as a\nplug-and-play module and easily employed to enhance the ranking ability of\nvarious ranking layers of a real-world RecSys with significantly reduced\ncomputational overhead. Through comprehensive experiments across four benchmark\ndatasets with varying levels of sparsity, we demonstrate that our strategy\nyields noticeable improvements (i.e., 8.1% on average) during testing time with\nlittle to no additional computational overheads (i.e., 0.5 on average).

    "abstract": "In multiple-input multiple-output integrated sensing and communication (MIMO\nISAC) systems, radio frequency chain (i.e., RF chain) selection plays a vital\nrole in reducing hardware cost, power consumption, and computational\ncomplexity. However, designing an effective RF chain selection strategy is\nchallenging due to the disparity in performance metrics between communication\nand sensing-mutual information (MI) versus beam-pattern mean-squared error\n(MSE) or the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB). To overcome this, we propose a\nlow-complexity greedy RF chain selection framework maximizing a unified\nMI-based performance metric applicable to both functions. By decomposing the\ntotal MI into individual contributions of each RF chain, we introduce two\napproaches: greedy eigen-based selection (GES) and greedy cofactor-based\nselection (GCS), which iteratively identify and remove the RF chains with the\nlowest contribution. We further extend our framework to beam selection for\nbeamspace MIMO ISAC systems, introducing diagonal beam selection (DBS) as a\nsimplified solution. Simulation results show that our proposed methods achieve\nnear-optimal performance with significantly lower complexity than exhaustive\nsearch, demonstrating their practical effectiveness for MIMO ISAC systems.",

    "abstract": "As the frequency of cyber threats increases, conventional penetration testing\nis failing to capture the entirety of todays complex environments. To solve\nthis problem, we propose the Vulnerability Mitigation System (VMS), a novel\nagent based on a Large Language Model (LLM) capable of performing penetration\ntesting without human intervention. The VMS has a two-part architecture for\nplanning and a Summarizer, which enable it to generate commands and process\nfeedback. To standardize testing, we designed two new Capture the Flag (CTF)\nbenchmarks based on the PicoCTF and OverTheWire platforms with 200 challenges.\nThese benchmarks allow us to evaluate how effectively the system functions. We\nperformed a number of experiments using various LLMs while tuning the\ntemperature and top-p parameters and found that GPT-4o performed best,\nsometimes even better than expected. The results indicate that LLMs can be\neffectively applied to many cybersecurity tasks; however, there are risks. To\nensure safe operation, we used a containerized environment. Both the VMS and\nthe benchmarks are publicly available, advancing the creation of secure,\nautonomous cybersecurity tools.",

It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic\nworkflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance\n(PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are\ncritically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is\ntypically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR\nscans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis\nmethods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between\nthe generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for\nreliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D\nWavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by\nperforming modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a\nWavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the\ncapture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent\nspaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we\ndisentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the\nstructural component to prevent warping.

    "abstract": "Inductive bias is a key factor in spatial regression models, determining how\nwell a model can learn from limited data and capture spatial patterns. This\nwork revisits the inductive biases in Geographically Neural Network Weighted\nRegression (GNNWR) and identifies limitations in current approaches for\nmodeling spatial non-stationarity. While GNNWR extends traditional\nGeographically Weighted Regression by using neural networks to learn spatial\nweighting functions, existing implementations are often restricted by fixed\ndistance-based schemes and limited inductive bias. We propose to generalize\nGNNWR by incorporating concepts from convolutional neural networks, recurrent\nneural networks, and transformers, introducing local receptive fields,\nsequential context, and self-attention into spatial regression. Through\nextensive benchmarking on synthetic spatial datasets with varying\nheterogeneity, noise, and sample sizes, we show that GNNWR outperforms classic\nmethods in capturing nonlinear and complex spatial relationships. Our results\nalso reveal that model performance depends strongly on data characteristics,\nwith local models excelling in highly heterogeneous or small-sample scenarios,\nand global models performing better with larger, more homogeneous data. These\nfindings highlight the importance of inductive bias in spatial modeling and\nsuggest future directions, including learnable spatial weighting functions,\nhybrid neural architectures, and improved interpretability for models handling\nnon-stationary spatial data.",

However, a more comprehensive test of\nthe cosmological model should also include the lensing effect in low density\nregions. In this work, we incorporate the stacked weak lensing signals around\nthe low density positions, alongside galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy\ntwo point correlation function to perform a joint cosmological analysis on\n$\\sigma_8$. The low density positions are constructed from the DR9 data release\nof the DESI legacy imaging survey, using galaxies with r-band absolute\nmagnitude cut M$<$-21.5 and in the redshift range of 0.18$<$z$<$0.28. In doing\nso, we simultaneously parameterize photometric redshift errors and halo mass\nuncertainties while building mock catalogs from simulations using the method of\nSubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAM). For the weak lensing measurements, we use\nthe shear estimators derived from the DECaLS DR8 imaging data, processed by the\nFourier_Quad pipeline.

    "abstract": "A central challenge in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) public health\npolicy lies in determining whether to universally expand treatment access,\ndespite the risk of sub-optimal adherence and consequent drug resistance, or to\nadopt a more strategic allocation of resources that balances treatment coverage\nwith adherence support. This dilemma is further complicated by the need for\ntimely switching to second-line therapy, which is critical for managing\ntreatment failure but imposes additional burdens on limited healthcare\nresources. In this study, we develop and analyze a compartmental model of HIV\ntransmission that incorporates both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains,\ndiagnosis status, and treatment progression, including switching to second-line\ntherapy upon detection of resistance. Basic reproduction numbers for both\nstrains are derived, and equilibrium analysis reveals the existence of a\ndisease-free state and two endemic states, where the drug-sensitive strain may\nbe eliminated while the drug-resistant strain persists. Local and global\nsensitivity analyses are performed, using partial rank correlation coefficient\n(PRCC) and Sobol methods, to identify key parameters influencing different\nmodel outcomes. We extend the model using optimal control theory to assess\nmultiple intervention strategies targeting diagnosis, treatment initiation, and\nadherence. A novel dynamic control framework is proposed to achieve the UNAIDS\n95-95-95 targets through efficient resource allocation. Numerical simulations\nvalidate the analytical results and compare the effectiveness and\ncost-efficiency of control strategies.

This paper presents a novel methodology for\ninterpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a\nBoiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM\n(Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning\ntechnique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation\npatterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a\nsparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the\nadaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we\nemployed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while\nsilencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a\nstatistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively\nled to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative\nanalysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's\nability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information.

These systems analyse vehicle\nvibrations and measure average traffic speeds to detect traffic events.\nHowever, these systems face difficulties in detecting early signs of\nnon-recurring traffic congestions in low-density traffic flow caused by\npresence of single-lane abnormal events. This is because average traffic speeds\ndo not decrease quickly in such events. During abnormal events, multiple\nvehicles perform spontaneous braking and abrupt lane-changes to avoid obstacles\non travel lanes. These vehicle behaviours gradually lead to traffic congestion.\nThus, frequent lane-change maneuver, performed by multiple vehicles at similar\nlocation, may suggest occurrence of congestion-inducing abnormal events. This\npaper discusses methods to identify and locate occurrence of these single-lane\nabnormal events by detecting frequent lane-change maneuver along road sections.\nWe first propose a method to locate vehicle positions along a road section and\nestimate the vehicle path. We then propose a method to detect vehicle\nlane-change maneuver by monitoring variations in spectral centroid of vehicle\nvibrations. The evaluation of our proposed methods with real traffic data for\ntwo different expressways showed 81.5% accuracy for individual vehicle path\ntracking and 83.5% accuracy in lane-change event detection.

The averaged adjacent gap ratio is sensitive to the distribution of\nrandom couplings, which remains independent of the Hamiltonian's symmetry. The\ngeneralization of the SYK model to non-Gaussian distributions and the inclusion\nof bulk fermion mass remain qualitatively similar to the Gaussian and massless\ncases. Key deviations manifest only in the time scales for the linear ramp in\nthe spectral form factor and entanglement entropy saturation.",

We develop a theoretical formalism for first-principles\ncalculation of five- and six-phonon scatterings using Green's function\ntechniques based on a diagrammatic formalism, and systematically investigate\nmulti-phonon interactions in Si, MgO, and BaO from room temperature to near\nmelting points. Our calculation reveals dramatically different\nmaterial-dependent behaviors: while five- and six-phonon processes remain\nnegligible in Si, they become increasingly important in MgO and dominant in BaO\nnear its melting point, where they surpass three- and four-phonon scattering\nintensity and significantly reduce lattice thermal conductivity. We demonstrate\nthat the strength of higher-order interactions is primarily governed by\ninteratomic force constants, with BaO exhibiting five- and six-phonon\nscattering rates over one order of magnitude stronger than MgO despite\nidentical crystal structures, due to large scattering phase space arising from\nsoftened harmonic interactions.

Despite\nmany advanced methodologies, the seamless integration of temporal and spatial\ninformation remains a challenge. The space-time cube (STC) stands out as a\npromising approach for the synergistic presentation of spatial and temporal\ninformation, with successful applications across various spatiotemporal\ndatasets. However, the STC is plagued by well-known issues such as visual\nocclusion and depth ambiguity, which are further exacerbated when dealing with\nlarge-scale spatial time series data. In this study, we introduce a novel\ntechnical framework termed VolumeSTCube, designed for continuous spatiotemporal\nphenomena. It first leverages the concept of the STC to transform discretely\ndistributed spatial time series data into continuously volumetric data.\nSubsequently, volume rendering and surface rendering techniques are employed to\nvisualize the transformed volumetric data. Volume rendering is utilized to\nmitigate visual occlusion, while surface rendering provides pattern details by\nenhanced lighting information. Lastly, we design interactions to facilitate the\nexploration and analysis from temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal\nperspectives. VolumeSTCube is evaluated through a computational experiment, a\nreal-world case study with one expert, and a controlled user study with twelve\nnon-experts, compared against a baseline from prior work, showing its\nsuperiority and effectiveness in largescale spatial time series analysis.",

Compared with previous slab density functional theory\ncalculations, which use the electrostatic potential as a proxy for bonding, our\nanalytical model provides a more direct description of bonding, explicitly\nincludes screening (which is often ignored), and is based on simple,\ninterpretable, and well benchmarked parameters.

This suggests interference\nbetween the graphene and remote substrate potentials, plus interfacial\nreconstructions, must be considered when interpreting experiments on remote\nepitaxy. We use our model to interpret previous experiments from the remote\nepitaxy and related literature, highlighting connections to moire epitaxy and\nto the ordering of graphite intercalation compounds.

However,\nrecent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce.\nMost detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn\napproximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed\nrotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation\nequivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve\napproximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation\nequivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open\nquestion. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone\nand neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with\napproximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the\nimpact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.\nAdditionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant\nfeatures, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter\ncount while improving detection accuracy.

    "abstract": "Clustering analysis is fundamental in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)\ndata analysis for elucidating cellular heterogeneity and diversity. Recent\ngraph-based scRNA-seq clustering methods, particularly graph neural networks\n(GNNs), have significantly improved in tackling the challenges of\nhigh-dimension, high-sparsity, and frequent dropout events that lead to\nambiguous cell population boundaries. However, their reliance on hard graph\nconstructions derived from thresholded similarity matrices presents\nchallenges:(i) The simplification of intercellular relationships into binary\nedges (0 or 1) by applying thresholds, which restricts the capture of\ncontinuous similarity features among cells and leads to significant information\nloss.(ii) The presence of significant inter-cluster connections within hard\ngraphs, which can confuse GNN methods that rely heavily on graph structures,\npotentially causing erroneous message propagation and biased clustering\noutcomes. To tackle these challenges, we introduce scSGC, a Soft Graph\nClustering for single-cell RNA sequencing data, which aims to more accurately\ncharacterize continuous similarities among cells through non-binary edge\nweights, thereby mitigating the limitations of rigid data structures. The scSGC\nframework comprises three core components: (i) a zero-inflated negative\nbinomial (ZINB)-based feature autoencoder; (ii) a dual-channel cut-informed\nsoft graph embedding module; and (iii) an optimal transport-based clustering\noptimization module. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate that\nscSGC outperforms 13 state-of-the-art clustering models in clustering accuracy,\ncell type annotation, and computational efficiency. These results highlight its\nsubstantial potential to advance scRNA-seq data analysis and deepen our\nunderstanding of cellular heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting is a fundamental task with broad applications, yet\nconventional methods often treat data as discrete sequences, overlooking their\norigin as noisy samples of continuous processes. Crucially, discrete noisy\nobservations cannot uniquely determine a continuous function; instead, they\ncorrespond to a family of plausible functions. Mathematically, time series can\nbe viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a\nshared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as\nlearning the transition from the historical function family to the future\nfunction family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we\nleverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships\nbetween their underlying continuous functions? (2) How can we model the\ntransition path in function space from the historical function family to the\nfuture function family? To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a\nnovel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for\nlearning path of measure between historical and future function families. By\nparameterizing the velocity field of the flow in infinite-dimensional function\nspaces, NeuTSFlow moves beyond traditional methods that focus on dependencies\nat discrete points, directly modeling function-level features instead.\nExperiments on diverse forecasting tasks demonstrate NeuTSFlow's superior\naccuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of the function-family\nperspective.",

However, most existing\nlearning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the\nRGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent\nchallenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional\ninformation. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,\nwhich first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the\nfirst stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI\ndatasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the\nRGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace\nlatent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a\ndirect high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction\nquality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,\nwhich adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral\nreconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism\nensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an\nentropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world\nscenarios.

Since the kernel governs critical system operations and\nenforces isolation boundaries between user space and privileged data, any\nmechanism that modifies its behavior must meet the highest standards of safety\nand correctness. To this end, the eBPF toolchain includes a verifier, which\nstatically checks safety properties such as memory access validity, bounded\nloops, and type correctness before loading the program into the kernel.\nHowever, the existing verifier is both overly conservative in some\ncases-rejecting valid programs-and unsound in others, permitting unsafe\nbehavior that violates the intended semantics of the kernel interface.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce BeePL, a domain-specific language\nfor eBPF with a formally verified type system. The BeePL type system, along\nwith the language design, statically enforces key safety properties such as\ntype-correct memory access, safe pointer usage, absence of unbounded loops, and\nstructured control flow. These guarantees are backed by formal type soundness\nproofs, ensuring that well-typed programs satisfy the safety invariants\nrequired by the eBPF execution environment. BeePL also proves that well-typed\nsource programs meet critical eBPF-specific properties related to memory\nsafety, termination, and control flow, enabling high-level reasoning prior to\ncompilation. For properties not fully enforceable statically-such as dynamic\nbounds and undefined behavior-BeePL inserts semantics-preserving runtime checks\nduring compilation.

Previous work\n\\cite{chekuri2022covering} considered the setting when $r$ is large and\ndeveloped bi-criteria approximation algorithms, and approximation algorithms\nfor the important special case when each $f_i$ is a weighted coverage function.\nThese are fairly general models and capture several concrete and interesting\nproblems as special cases.

In\nthis paper, motivated by some recent applications, we consider the problem when\n$r$ is a \\emph{fixed constant} and obtain two main results. For covering\nmultiple submodular constraints we obtain a randomized bi-criteria\napproximation algorithm that for any given integer $\\alpha \\ge 1$ outputs a set\n$S$ such that $f_i(S) \\ge$ $(1-1/e^\\alpha -\\epsilon)b_i$ for each $i \\in [r]$\nand $\\mathbb{E}[c(S)] \\le (1+\\epsilon)\\alpha \\cdot \\sf{OPT}$.

In this work, we theoretically study the electronic\nstructure evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and provide a consistent\nexplanation to three unique features of this system, i.e. the semiconducting\nferromagnetism at low pressure, the metallic ferromagnetism at high pressure,\nand the enhanced Curie temperature in the metallic phase.

Central to our discovery is\nthe dual role of metallicity -- it simultaneously establishes kinetically\ndriven exchange via $d$-$p$ hybridization and enables Stoner-type magnetic\ninstability, with the contribution also from the residual super-exchange. Our\nanalyses reveal that {\\it intraband} excitations dominate the pressure-enhanced\n$\\omega_p^2$ and $T_c$ correlation.

    "abstract": "Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals\nwith high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as\nautonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid\ndevelopment of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning\ncapabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual\ninformation for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video\nreasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content\nwhile reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning\nparadigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive\nand cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the\nVideo-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for\nkey-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore\nthe potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances\nperformance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively\nactivates more neuron values in MLLMs.",

Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as\npath patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their\nnotable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a\nfunction induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from\nstandard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the\nstructure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it\nto a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1\nfunction is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which\nemits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function\ninduction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic\ntasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8\naddition.

We aim at constraining planet formation and evolution\nprocesses by statistically analysing planetary systems generated by the\nGeneration III Bern model, comparing with the correlations derived from\nobservational samples. Using synthetic planets biased to observational\ncompleteness, we find that (1) the occurrence rates of large giant planets and\nNeptune-size planets are positively correlated with [Fe/H], while small\nsub-Earths exhibit an anti-correlation. In between, for sub-Neptune and\nsuper-Earth, the occurrence rate first increases and then decreases with\nincreasing [Fe/H] with an inflection point at 0.1 dex. (2) Planets with orbital\nperiods shorter than ten days are more likely to be found around stars with\nhigher metallicity, and this tendency weakens with increasing planet radius.\n(3) Both giant planets and small planets exhibit a positive correlation between\nthe eccentricity and [Fe/H], which could be explained by the self-excitation\nand perturbation of outer giant planets. (4) The radius valley deepens and\nbecomes more prominent with increasing [Fe/H], accompanied by a lower\nsuper-Earth-to-sub-Neptune ratio. Furthermore, the average radius of the\nplanets above the valley increases with [Fe/H]. Our nominal model successfully\nreproduces many observed correlations with stellar metallicity, supporting the\ndescription of physical processes and parameters included in the Bern model.\nHowever, the dependences of orbital eccentricity and period on [Fe/H] predicted\nby the synthetic population is however significantly weaker than observed.

However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive\ntraining of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial\ncomputational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training\nefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel\nalignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts\nintractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic\ninversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new\npost-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward\nmodels or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and\nefficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image\ngeneration and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive\nexperiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO\ncompared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the\ntrained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent\nimages. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a\npaired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations\nand comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of\ngenerative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient,\nhigh-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to\ncomplex realistic generation tasks.

To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework that\nintegrates HE with advanced neural networks to secure facial data throughout\nthe inference phase.

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) networks has led to a surge\nin security vulnerabilities, emphasizing the critical need for robust anomaly\ndetection and classification techniques. In this work, we propose a novel\napproach for identifying anomalies in IoT network traffic by leveraging the\nMel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and ResNet-18, a deep learning model\nknown for its effectiveness in feature extraction and image-based tasks.\nLearnable MFCCs enable adaptive spectral feature representation, capturing the\ntemporal patterns inherent in network traffic more effectively than traditional\nfixed MFCCs. We demonstrate that transforming raw signals into MFCCs maps the\ndata into a higher-dimensional space, enhancing class separability and enabling\nmore effective multiclass classification. Our approach combines the strengths\nof MFCCs with the robust feature extraction capabilities of ResNet-18, offering\na powerful framework for anomaly detection. The proposed model is evaluated on\nthree widely used IoT intrusion detection datasets: CICIoT2023, NSL-KDD, and\nIoTID20. The experimental results highlight the potential of integrating\nadaptive signal processing techniques with deep learning architectures to\nachieve robust and scalable anomaly detection in heterogeneous IoT network\nlandscapes.",

While recent works show that base models can acquire such reasoning\ntraces via reinforcement learning or distillation from stronger models like\nDeepSeek-R1, previous works demonstrate that even short CoT prompting without\nfine-tuning is able to improve reasoning. We ask whether long CoT can be\ninduced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20\nlong CoT examples from the reasoning model \\texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly\nfine-tune the base model \\texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms\nthe much larger \\texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of\nhigh-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further\nexplore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced\nwith prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However,\nneither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that\ncertain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate. We analyze\nkey properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty, diversity, and\nanswer length, that influence reasoning distillation. While challenges remain,\nwe are optimistic that carefully curated human-written CoT, even in small\nquantities, can activate reasoning behaviors in base models.

It is commonly accepted that as one moves away from\nthe vortex's axis of an $s$-wave superconductor, the density of superconductive\nelectrons gradually increases from zero to its bulk value. However, we\ndemonstrate that this behavior is qualitatively altered in the zero-temperature\nlimit provided that the Cooper pairs comprising the superconductive liquid are\nsufficiently tightly bound. Specifically, outside the vortex core, the density\nof superconductive electrons reaches a maximum surpassing its bulk value. This\nphenomenon has electrostatic origins: since normal electrons are absent and\nthere exists a charged ionic background, the spatial variation of the charge\ndensity of superconductive electrons violates local neutrality, leading to the\ngeneration of an electric field. This electric field shrinks the vortex core\nand turns the density profile into that with a maximum, ensuring global\nneutrality. The effect is most pronounced in the limit of strong electrostatic\nscreening, where the field configurations describing the vortex attain a\nuniversal form, with the electric field screened over a length scale determined\nby the London penetration depth.",

However, WSD relies on explicit decay\nphases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at\nthe cost of additional memory.

    "abstract": "Protecting cyberspace requires not only advanced tools but also a shift in\nhow we reason about threats, trust, and autonomy. Traditional cybersecurity\nmethods rely on manual responses and brittle heuristics. To build proactive and\nintelligent defense systems, we need integrated theoretical frameworks and\nsoftware tools. Game theory provides a rigorous foundation for modeling\nadversarial behavior, designing strategic defenses, and enabling trust in\nautonomous systems. Meanwhile, software tools process cyber data, visualize\nattack surfaces, verify compliance, and suggest mitigations. Yet a disconnect\nremains between theory and practical implementation.\n  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI offers a new path to\nbridge this gap. LLM-powered agents can operationalize abstract strategies into\nreal-world decisions. Conversely, game theory can inform the reasoning and\ncoordination of these agents across complex workflows. LLMs also challenge\nclassical game-theoretic assumptions, such as perfect rationality or static\npayoffs, prompting new models aligned with cognitive and computational\nrealities. This co-evolution promises richer theoretical foundations and novel\nsolution concepts. Agentic AI also reshapes software design: systems must now\nbe modular, adaptive, and trust-aware from the outset.\n  This chapter explores the intersection of game theory, agentic AI, and\ncybersecurity. We review key game-theoretic frameworks (e.g., static, dynamic,\nBayesian, and signaling games) and solution concepts. We then examine how LLM\nagents can enhance cyber defense and introduce LLM-driven games that embed\nreasoning into AI agents. Finally, we explore multi-agent workflows and\ncoordination games, outlining how this convergence fosters secure, intelligent,\nand adaptive cyber systems.",
