    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has transformed sequential decision making, yet\ntraditional algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) often struggle with efficient exploration, stability, and\nadaptability in dynamic environments.

Evaluated in a 10X10\ngrid-world over 20,000 episodes, ARDNS-FN-Quantum achieves a 99.5% success rate\n(versus 81.3% for DQN and 97.0% for PPO), a mean reward of 9.0528 across all\nepisodes (versus 1.2941 for DQN and 7.6196 for PPO), and an average of 46.7\nsteps to goal (versus 135.9 for DQN and 62.5 for PPO). In the last 100\nepisodes, it records a mean reward of 9.1652 (versus 7.0916 for DQN and 9.0310\nfor PPO) and 37.2 steps to goal (versus 52.7 for DQN and 53.4 for PPO).\nGraphical analyses, including learning curves, steps-to-goal trends, reward\nvariance, and reward distributions, demonstrate ARDNS-FN-Quantum's superior\nstability (reward variance 5.424 across all episodes versus 252.262 for DQN and\n76.583 for PPO) and efficiency. By bridging quantum computing, cognitive\nscience, and RL, ARDNS-FN-Quantum offers a scalable, human-like approach to\nadaptive learning in uncertain environments, with potential applications in\nrobotics, autonomous systems, and decision-making under uncertainty.",

At visible and\nnear-infrared frequencies, titania or silicon are routinely used as substrates\nto realize these ultrathin devices, ideally suited for conventional\nnanofabrication techniques. Unfortunately, directly scaling these design and\nmaterial approaches to long-wave infrared frequencies is not practical, due to\nchallenges in the required thicknesses and the presence of phonon absorption\nlines. Nonlocal metasurfaces based on extended resonances with a local\ngeometric phase offer a compelling design platform that can address these\nchallenges. They enable ultrathin metasurfaces, as they leverage lattice\nresonances, while they also offer multi-functionalities and\nfrequency-selectivity, and they can be implemented in a range of low-loss\nmaterial platforms. Here, we demonstrate nonlocal metalenses based on germanium\nthin films on a zinc-selenide substrate, operating around 10.3{\\mu}m within a\ndeeply subwavelength device thickness of 1.45{\\mu}m (14% the free-space\nwavelength). We showcase a novel meta-unit geometry based on a square lattice\nwith highly isotropic dispersion features, supporting a resonant geometric\nphase that is highly stable in frequency, simplifying the rational design of\ncomplex metasurface operations.

This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs\ngenerated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a\npeephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual\nfunctions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs\ndecision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process.\nAdditionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors\nintroduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during\ncompilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and\nevaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show\nthat PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these\nprojects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code.

However, scenes that satisfy strict\ntask requirements, such as high-clutter environments with plausible spatial\narrangement, are rare and costly to curate manually. Instead, we generate\nlarge-scale scene data using procedural models that approximate realistic\nenvironments for robotic manipulation, and adapt it to task-specific goals.

However, none of these objects were detected by Chandra, giving\nan upper limit to their rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosity (Lx) of 2e44 erg/s (2\nsigma), assuming a spectral slope Gamma=2. Subsequent rest-frame optical\nspectroscopy of these objects by the JWST-NIRSpec, presented in a companion\npaper, show weak broad Balmer emission at the base of narrow cores. With the\nscaling relation for low-redshift AGN, the observed strong [OIII]5007 flux of\nthese sources would predict Lx to be around 1e45 erg/s, which is well above the\nChandra upper limits. These optical spectra and X-ray quietness are reminiscent\nof JWST-selected broad-line AGN. We attribute the weak broad Balmer emission to\nthe broad-line regions hidden partially by optically-thick obscuring matter\nwhich also hides the optical and X-ray continuum emission from the accretion\ndisc. Compton-thick obscuration, which would strongly suppress X-ray emission,\ncould be due to a dense inter-stellar medium that is often present in galaxies\nat high redshifts.

However, the\nlink between these objects and classical unobscured quasars remains a mystery.\nHere we report the discovery of obscured quasars hosted by the most luminous\ngalaxies at $z > 6$, possibly bridging the gap between the two AGN populations.\nThe 13 objects presented here were originally selected from a rest-frame\nultraviolet (UV) imaging survey over $>$1000 deg$^2$, and were known to have\nluminous ($>10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) narrow Ly$\\alpha$ emission. With\nJWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations, we found that 7 out of 11 objects with\nnarrow Ly$\\alpha$ exhibit a broad component in H I Balmer lines and He I lines,\nbut not in [O III] and other forbidden lines. Mild dust obscuration ($0 < A_V <\n3$) is inferred from the Balmer decrements. The estimated intrinsic\nluminosities suggest that our broad line (BL) objects are the long-sought\nUV-obscured counterparts of luminous quasars in the EoR. They host supermassive\nblack holes (SMBHs) with masses $10^{7.8 - 9.1} M_\\odot$, undergoing\nsub-Eddington to Eddington accretion. Most of the BL objects are spatially\nunresolved, and are close to \"little red dots\" with their blue rest-UV and red\nrest-optical colors. We estimate the AGN number density among similarly\nluminous Ly$\\alpha$ emitters to be larger than $2 \\times 10^{-8}$ Mpc$^{-3}$.\nThis density is comparable to that of classical quasars with similar continuum\nluminosities, suggesting that a substantial fraction of active SMBHs are\nobscured in the EoR and have been overlooked in past rest-UV surveys.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we review recent theoretical research on photocontrol of\nmagnetism in several spin-charge coupled systems. The control of magnetism with\nlight has been a central issue in condensed-matter physics, attracting enormous\nresearch interest both for fundamental science and for technological\napplications. This field of research has developed rapidly in recent years\nalong with the development of laser technology. However, because the direct\ncoupling between the light magnetic field and magnetization via the Zeeman\ncoupling is very weak in terms of the energy scale, it is, in principle,\ndifficult to induce dramatic effects as far as this magnetic light-matter\ninteraction is exploited. On the contrary, the interaction between the light\nelectric field and electron charges has an energy scale two to three orders of\nmagnitude larger than that of the magnetic interaction. Therefore, we may\nrealize astonishing photoinduced physical phenomena and novel optical device\nfunctions by exploiting this electric light-matter interaction. Spin-charge\ncoupled magnets, e.g., double-exchange magnets, multiferroics materials, and\nRashba electron systems, in which spins and charges are strongly coupled\nthrough several kinds of mechanisms such as exchange interactions and\nspin-orbit coupling, are ideal systems for realizing this idea. Recent\ntheoretical studies have revealed that it is possible to control, manipulate\nand switch the magnetization coupled to electron charges in these systems\nthrough exciting and/or driving them with light electric fields. The following\nthree recent topics are discussed as examples of such theoretical studies, that\nis, photoinduced magnetic phase transitions in irradiated double-exchange\nmodels, highly efficient photoinduction of spin polarization in Rashba electron\nsystems, and electromagnon excitations and their intense excitation effects in\nmultiferroic materials.",

    "abstract": "Action-values play a central role in popular Reinforcement Learing (RL)\nmodels of behavior. Yet, the idea that action-values are explicitly represented\nhas been extensively debated. Critics had therefore repeatedly suggested that\npolicy-gradient (PG) models should be favored over value-based (VB) ones, as a\npotential solution for this dilemma. Here we argue that this solution is\nunsatisfying. This is because PG methods are not, in fact, \"Value-free\" --\nwhile they do not rely on an explicit representation of Value for acting\n(stimulus-response mapping), they do require it for learning. Hence, switching\nto PG models is, per se, insufficient for eliminating Value from models of\nbehavior. More broadly, the requirement for a representation of Value stems\nfrom the underlying assumptions regarding the optimization objective posed by\nthe standard RL framework, not from the particular algorithm chosen to solve\nit. Previous studies mostly took these standard RL assumptions for granted, as\npart of their conceptualization or problem modeling, while debating the\ndifferent methods used to optimize it (i.e., PG or VB). We propose that,\ninstead, the focus of the debate should shift to critically evaluating the\nunderlying modeling assumptions. Such evaluation is particularly important from\nan experimental perspective. Indeed, the very notion of Value must be\nreconsidered when standard assumptions (e.g., risk neutrality,\nfull-observability, Markovian environment, exponential discounting) are\nrelaxed, as is likely in natural settings. Finally, we use the Value debate as\na case study to argue in favor of a more nuanced, algorithmic rather than\nstatistical, view of what constitutes \"a model\" in cognitive sciences. Our\nanalysis suggests that besides \"parametric\" statistical complexity, additional\naspects such as computational complexity must also be taken into account when\nevaluating model complexity.",

One of the main challenges in model-based methods is\nfinding an effective prior to describe the statistical distribution of the\ntarget image.

While PnP/RED methods with\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) based denoisers outperform classical\nhand-crafted priors in CS MRI, their convergence theory relies on assumptions\nthat do not hold for practical CNNs.

In this paper, we experimentally\ninvestigate the drainage and lifetime of surface bubbles in solutions\ncontaining surfactants and salts, subjected to turbulence in the air\nsurrounding them modelling the wind above the ocean. We carefully construct a\nsetup allowing us to repeatably measure the mean lifetime of a series of\nsurface bubbles, while varying the solution and the wind speed or humidity of\nthe air. To that end, we show that renewing the surface layer is critical to\navoid a change of the physical properties of the interface. We show that the\ndrainage of the bubbles is well modelled by taking into account the outwards\nviscous flow and convective evaporation. The mean lifetime of surface bubbles\nin solutions containing no salt is controlled by evaporation and independent on\nsurfactant concentration. When salt is added, the same scaling is valid only at\nhigh surfactant concentrations. At low concentrations, the lifetime is always\nsmaller and independent of wind speed, owing to the presence of impurities\ntriggering a thick bursting event. When the mean lifetime is controlled by\nevaporation, the probability density of lifetime is very narrow around its\nmean, while when impurities are present, a broad distribution is observed.",

Here, we utilize the\nconservation of optical chirality to connect the parity and time-reversal\nsymmetries of the intrinsic excitational eigenmodes of a material to those of\ntheir associated electromagnetic eigenfields as dictated by Maxwell's\nequations. To make this connection explicit, we theoretically examine the\nBorn-Kuhn (BK) system, composed of a pair of plasmonic nanorods of variable\nseparation, as a prototypical material model that is both geometrically chiral\nin its static structure and truly excitationally chiral in its eigenexcitations\nand eigenfields. By relaying optical chirality metrics of the BK eigenfields\nback to their underlying sourcing material degrees of freedom, we derive a\nunique mechanical chirality measure that is related to, but distinct from,\nother pseudoscalar metrics recently discussed in the literature. Beyond\nanalysis in the absence of sources, we further derive optical chiral\nextinction, scattering, and absorption cross sections under external drive and\ndiscuss their rigorous connection to more common circular dichroism\nmeasurements as well as their limitations in comparison to eigenfield chirality\nmetrics.

However,\nexisting navigation methods rely on electromagnetic (EM) tracking, which is\nsusceptible to interference and position drift, or require manual adjustments\nbased on operator expertise. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel\nanatomy-aware pose estimation system that determines the ICE catheter position\nand orientation solely from ICE images, eliminating the need for external\ntracking sensors. Our approach leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based deep\nlearning model, which captures spatial relationships between ICE images and\nanatomical structures. The model is trained on a clinically acquired dataset of\n851 subjects, including ICE images paired with position and orientation labels\nnormalized to the left atrium (LA) mesh. ICE images are patchified into 16x16\nembeddings and processed through a transformer network, where a [CLS] token\nindependently predicts position and orientation via separate linear layers.

Experimental results demonstrate an\naverage positional error of 9.48 mm and orientation errors of (16.13 deg, 8.98\ndeg, 10.47 deg) across x, y, and z axes, confirming the model accuracy.\nQualitative assessments further validate alignment between predicted and target\nviews within 3D cardiac meshes.

We\nquantify the probability of self-lensing through the optical depth $\\tau$ for\nthe main channels of detectable GWs at frequencies $f_{\\rm GW}\\sim\n(1-10^3)\\,{\\rm Hz}$. We then analyze the detectability of the lensing effect\n(imprint).

Additionally, the\nlensing imprint of a stellar-mass lens (diffraction and interference) is too\nmarginal to be detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors and most Einstein\nTelescope signals. For a massive BH lens in the center of a cluster, the\nprobability can reach $\\tau\\simeq 10^{-4}$ either via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai\ninduced mergers of BBHs orbiting a central massive BH, or BBHs formed as GW\ncaptures in single-single interactions in the Bahcall-Wolf cusp of a nuclear\ncluster.

To\nprovide some foundational insight, in this paper we analyse how confabulation\noccurs in reservoir computers (RCs): a dynamical system in the form of an ANN.\nRCs are particularly useful to study as they are known to confabulate in a\nwell-defined way: when RCs are trained to reconstruct the dynamics of a given\nattractor, they sometimes construct an attractor that they were not trained to\nconstruct, a so-called `untrained attractor' (UA). This paper sheds light on\nthe role played by UAs when reconstruction fails and their influence when\nmodelling transitions between reconstructed attractors.

    "abstract": "Sweat secretion and evaporation from the skin dictate the human ability to\nthermoregulate and thermal comfort in hot environments and impact skin\ninteractions with cosmetics, textiles, and wearable electronics or sensors.\nHowever, sweating has mostly been investigated using macroscopic physiological\nmethods, leaving micro-to-macroscale sweating dynamics unexplored. We explore\nthese processes by employing a coupled microscale imaging and transport\nmeasurement approach used in engineering studies of phase change processes.\nSpecifically, we employed a comprehensive set of macroscale physiological\nmeasurements (ventilated capsule sweat rate, galvanic skin conductance, and\ndielectric epidermis hydration) complemented by three microscale imaging\ntechniques (visible light, midwave infrared, and optical coherence tomography\nimaging). Inspired by industrial jet cooling devices, we also explore an air\njet (vs. cylindrical) capsule for measuring sweat rate. To enable near\nsimultaneous application of these methods, we studied forehead sweating\ndynamics of six supine subjects undergoing passive heating, cooling, and\nsecondary heating. The relative dynamics of the physiological measurements\nagree with prior observations and can be explained using imaged microscale\nsweating dynamics. This comprehensive study provides new insights into the\nbiophysical dynamics of sweating onset and following cyclic porewise,\ntransition, and filmwise sweating modes, and highlights the roles of stratum\ncorneum hydration, salt deposits, and microscale hair.",

    "abstract": "Determining the vanishing points (VPs) in a Manhattan world, as a fundamental\ntask in many 3D vision applications, consists of jointly inferring the line-VP\nassociation and locating each VP. Existing methods are, however, either\nsub-optimal solvers or pursuing global optimality at a significant cost of\ncomputing time. In contrast to prior works, we introduce convex relaxation\ntechniques to solve this task for the first time. Specifically, we employ a\n\"soft\" association scheme, realized via a truncated multi-selection error, that\nallows for joint estimation of VPs' locations and line-VP associations. This\napproach leads to a primal problem that can be reformulated into a\nquadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which is then\nrelaxed into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. To solve this SDP\nproblem efficiently, we present a globally optimal outlier-robust iterative\nsolver (called GlobustVP), which independently searches for one VP and its\nassociated lines in each iteration, treating other lines as outliers. After\neach independent update of all VPs, the mutual orthogonality between the three\nVPs in a Manhattan world is reinforced via local refinement. Extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that GlobustVP\nachieves a favorable balance between efficiency, robustness, and global\noptimality compared to previous works.

The proposed R2R architecture\nefficiently uses unlabelled and synthetic labelled data in a balanced\nproportion using a cluster-level uncertainty-driven feedback mechanism and a\nVLM-powered generative replay module. Unlike traditional memory-buffer methods\nthat depend on pretrained models and pseudo-labels, our R2R framework operates\nwithout any prior training.

Concurrently, a generative replay mechanism along\nwith DeepSeek-R1 powered CLIP VLM produces labelled synthetic data\nrepresentative of past experiences, resembling biological visual thinking that\nreplays memory to remember and act in new, unseen tasks. Extensive experimental\nanalyses are carried out in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, SVHN and\nTinyImageNet datasets.

This provides valuable information about\nthe evolutionary history of these systems, especially regarding whether the\nsecond-born Neutron Star (NS) originated from either a Core-Collapse ($CC$) or\nElectron-Capture Supernovae ($ECSNe$) event. The provided scale diagram\nillustrates the distribution of different types of DNSs on the basis of their\norbital parameters and other factors, including mass loss. As a result, the\nphysical processes in DNSs vary depending on the formation mechanisms of the\nsecond-born NS and characteristics of the systems. $ECSNe$ processes are\ntypically associated with merging systems ($e\\times{P_{orb}}< 0.05$), while\n$CC$ processes are more commonly linked to non-merging systems\n($e\\times{P_{orb}}> 0.05$). Our results suggest a critical mass threshold of\n1.30$M_\\odot \\pm 0.22M_\\odot$ (critical value) for the $ECSNe$ process to form\nan NS, while $CC$ processes might occur at higher masses. Examining the orbital\nparameters of DNSs in a known gravitational potential can enhance our\nunderstanding of the theoretical predictions for DNS progenitor\ncharacteristics. It turns out that the $ECSNe$ process predominantly produces\nDNS systems with short orbital ($P_{orb} \\leq 0.25 d$), nearly circular orbits\n($e\\simeq 0.2$), accompanied by minimal kick velocities imparted on the\nproto-NS and significant mass loss. In contrast, their orbital dynamics in a\nknown gravitational potential plays a crucial role in enhancing our\nunderstanding of the SNe geometry and the formation and evolution processes\namong different NS samples.",

Starlink\ndominates the market with over 7,000 operational satellites in low Earth orbit\n(LEO) and offers global high-speed and low-latency Internet service for\nstationary and mobile use cases, including in-motion connectivity for vehicles,\nvessels, and aircraft. Starlink terminals are designed to handle extreme\nweather conditions. Starlink recommends a flat high performance (FHP) terminal\nfor users living in areas with extreme weather conditions. The earlier studies\nevaluated Starlink's FHP throughput for stationary and in-motion users without\nproviding a detailed analysis of how weather affects its performance. There\nremains a need to investigate the impact of weather on FHP's throughput. In\nthis paper, we address this shortcoming by analyzing the impact of weather on\nStarlink's performance in Oulu, Finland, a city located in Northern Europe near\nthe Arctic Circle. Our measurements reveal that rain degrades median uplink and\ndownlink throughput by 52.27% and 37.84%, respectively. On the contrary, there\nwas no noticeable impact on the round-trip time. Additionally, we also examine\nthe impact of cloud cover on the Starlink throughput.

Ring-polymer instanton theories offer a\nvery promising approach to solve this problem, since they can be rigorously\nderived using semiclassical approximations and can capture nuclear quantum\neffects such as tunnelling and zero-point energy at a cost similar to that of a\nclassical calculation. A successful instanton rate theory already exists within\nthe Born--Oppenheimer approximation, for which the optimal tunnelling pathway\nis located on a single adiabatic surface. A related instanton theory has also\nbeen developed for nonadiabatic reactions using two weakly-coupled diabatic\nsurfaces within the framework of Fermi's golden rule. However, many chemical\nreactions do not satisfy the conditions of either limit. By employing a tunable\ndividing surface which measures the flux both along nuclear coordinates as well\nas between electronic states, we develop a generalised nonadiabatic instanton\nrate theory that bridges between these two limits. The resulting theory\napproximates the quantum-mechanically exact rates well for the systems studied\nand, in addition, offers a novel mechanistic perspective on nonadiabatic\nreactions.",

Classical approaches, however, face significant limitations due\nto photon loss, background noise, and the requirements for dynamical delay\nlines over large distances. This document surveys recent developments in\nquantum-enabled VLBI, which aim to address these challenges using\nentanglement-assisted protocols, quantum memory storage, and nonlocal\nmeasurement techniques. While its application to astronomy is well known, we\nalso examine how these techniques may be extended to geodesy -- specifically,\nthe monitoring of Earth's rotation. Particular attention is given to\nquantum-enhanced telescope architectures, including repeater-based long\nbaseline interferometry and quantum error-corrected encoding schemes, which\noffer a pathway toward high-fidelity optical VLBI. To aid the discussion, we\nalso compare specifications for key enabling technologies to current\nstate-of-the-art experimental components, including switching rates, gate\ntimes, entanglement distribution rates, and memory lifetimes. By integrating\nquantum technologies, future interferometric networks may achieve\ndiffraction-limited imaging at optical and near-infrared wavelengths,\nsurpassing the constraints of classical techniques and enabling new precision\ntests of astrophysical and fundamental physics phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Lane determination and lane sequence determination are important components\nfor many Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) applications. Lane determination\nhas been solved using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) among other methods. The\nexisting HMM literature for lane sequence determination uses empirical\ndefinitions with user-modified parameters to calculate HMM probabilities. The\nprobability definitions in the literature can cause breaks in the HMM due to\nthe inability to directly calculate probabilities of off-road positions,\nrequiring post-processing of data. This paper develops a time-varying HMM using\nthe physical properties of the roadway and vehicle, and the stochastic\nproperties of the sensors. This approach yields emission and transition\nprobability models conditioned on the sensor data without parameter tuning. It\nalso accounts for the probability that the vehicle is not in any roadway lane\n(e.g., on the shoulder or making a U-turn), which eliminates the need for\npost-processing to deal with breaks in the HMM processing. This approach\nrequires adapting the Viterbi algorithm and the HMM to be conditioned on the\nsensor data, which are then used to generate the most-likely sequence of lanes\nthe vehicle has traveled. The proposed approach achieves an average accuracy of\n95.9%. Compared to the existing literature, this provides an average increase\nof 2.25% by implementing the proposed transition probability and an average\nincrease of 5.1% by implementing both the proposed transition and emission\nprobabilities.",

In this study we explore the sensibility of\nthe QG-MC waves to the background magnetic field over which they propagate and\nto the frequency of the perturbation that can generate them in the Earth core.\nWe retrieve QG-MC waves propagating over a realistic background magnetic field\nby analysing the velocity fields, where they are most easily observed.\nConcentrations of QG-MC waves in the magnetic field at the core surface in our\nmodel are reminiscent of recently observed geomagnetic jerks. The QG-MC waves\nare weakly sensitive to the details of the background magnetic field during\ntheir travel in the bulk and their frequency at the core surface remains close\nto that of the initial perturbation. This is a potential asset for the\nprediction of their evolution. Moreover, the waves in the system exhibit a\ncomplex relation with the initial perturbation: when the frequency of the\ninitial pulsation is greater than a threshold -- depending on the Alfv\\'en\nspeed and the geometric complexity of the medium -- inward QG-Alfv\\'en waves\nare recovered at the core mantle boundary instead of QG-MC waves, and we find a\ncontinuum of waves from QG-MC to %inertial waves QG-Alfv\\'en waves depending on\nthe input frequency.

The first\nchapter presents a self-contained introduction to the field of cavity QED.\nFollowing this introductory material, we show in Chapter 2 how measurements of\nthe field emitted by a cavity can be leveraged for in-situ qubit noise\nspectroscopy in the presence of significant inhomogeneous broadening. We also\nidentify a signature of genuinely quantum noise in the cavity output field\noriginating from the non-commutation of bath operators acting on the qubit. In\nChapter 3, we present a novel quantum-optical effect whereby a suitable\nmodulation of a longitudinal cavity-qubit coupling can be used to entangle the\nstate of a qubit with the path taken by a multiphoton wavepacket. Entanglement\nbetween a qubit and a which-path degree-of-freedom can in turn be used to\ngenerate entanglement between distant stationary qubits. As shown in Chapter 4,\nqubit-which-path entanglement can also be exploited for maximally sensitive\nestimation of a phase in a Mach-Zehnder interferometry setup, i.e., sensing at\nthe quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound. In Chapter 5, we discuss strategies for\nrealizing stabilizer measurements using qubit-conditioned phase shifts applied\nto propagating pulses of radiation. We find that in the context of a subsystem\nsurface code, photon loss during such stabilizer measurements would not\nintroduce any horizontal hook errors on the code qubits. In the sixth and final\nchapter, we give protocols for performing entangling gates between distant\nstationary qubits using Fock- or time-bin encoded photons.",

We find that the impulse gradient\nof the strongest stellar encounter largely determines the net dynamical effect\nof field stars. Because the expected strength of such an encounter is uncertain\nby multiple orders of magnitude, the possible significance of field stars can\nbe large. Our simulations indicate that isolated models of the solar system can\nunderestimate the degree of our giant planets' future secular orbital changes\nby over an order of magnitude. In addition, our planets and Pluto are\nsignificantly less stable than previously thought. Field stars transform Pluto\nfrom a completely stable object over 5 Gyrs to one with a ~5% instability\nprobability. Furthermore, field stars increase the odds of Mercury's\ninstability by ~50-80%.

Building on foundational notions such as second modules and coprime\nmodules, we introduce new submodule products and characterize coprime modules\nusing these products. The study extends classical definitions by defining\n\\textbf{$\\mathscr{A}$-co-first modules} and \\textbf{$\\mathscr{A}$-fully\nco-first modules}, which utilize subclasses of preradicals to broaden the scope\nof coprimeness. Additionally, we investigate the lattice structure of conatural\nclasses and their closure properties, providing conditions under which co-first\nmodules coincide with second modules. The paper also examines the implications\nof these concepts in the context of left MAX rings and left perfect rings,\noffering a comparative analysis of coprimeness and secondness. Our results try\nto contribute to a deeper understanding of module theory and its applications,\nwhile highlighting connections between preradicals, module classes, and ring\nproperties.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a framework for robust uncertainty quantification in situations\nwhere labeled training data are corrupted, through noisy or missing labels. We\nbuild on conformal prediction, a statistical tool for generating prediction\nsets that cover the test label with a pre-specified probability. The validity\nof conformal prediction, however, holds under the i.i.d assumption, which does\nnot hold in our setting due to the corruptions in the data. To account for this\ndistribution shift, the privileged conformal prediction (PCP) method proposed\nleveraging privileged information (PI) -- additional features available only\nduring training -- to re-weight the data distribution, yielding valid\nprediction sets under the assumption that the weights are accurate. In this\nwork, we analyze the robustness of PCP to inaccuracies in the weights. Our\nanalysis indicates that PCP can still yield valid uncertainty estimates even\nwhen the weights are poorly estimated. Furthermore, we introduce uncertain\nimputation (UI), a new conformal method that does not rely on weight\nestimation. Instead, we impute corrupted labels in a way that preserves their\nuncertainty. Our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees and validated\nempirically on both synthetic and real benchmarks. Finally, we show that these\ntechniques can be integrated into a triply robust framework, ensuring\nstatistically valid predictions as long as at least one underlying method is\nvalid.",

Using a ray-tracer, we calculate the\nredshift drift directly from the light cone at two different time steps. To\ninvestigate observer-dependent biases we consider 10 different observers. We\nfind that inhomogeneity-induced fluctuations in the redshift drift can in\nextreme cases be of the same order as the cosmic signal for $z\\lesssim0.15$. By\ncomparing our results to first-order perturbation theory, we find that the\nextreme outliers are due to peculiar motion in over-densities and can be\ndescribed by first-order perturbation theory to percent precision. We calculate\nangular power spectra that fit very well with our theoretical predictions based\non perturbation theory at linear scales and show a surprisingly large\nnon-linear signal.

This dehybridization effect has been used to\nexplain the transport properties of inter-metallics and ARPES experiments in\nheavy fermions at sufficiently high temperatures.

    "abstract": "This dissertation considers Open-world Robot Manipulation, a manipulation\nproblem where a robot must generalize or quickly adapt to new objects, scenes,\nor tasks for which it has not been pre-programmed or pre-trained. This\ndissertation tackles the problem using a methodology of efficient sensorimotor\nlearning. The key to enabling efficient sensorimotor learning lies in\nleveraging regular patterns that exist in limited amounts of demonstration\ndata. These patterns, referred to as ``regularity,'' enable the data-efficient\nlearning of generalizable manipulation skills. This dissertation offers a new\nperspective on formulating manipulation problems through the lens of\nregularity. Building upon this notion, we introduce three major contributions.\nFirst, we introduce methods that endow robots with object-centric priors,\nallowing them to learn generalizable, closed-loop sensorimotor policies from a\nsmall number of teleoperation demonstrations. Second, we introduce methods that\nconstitute robots' spatial understanding, unlocking their ability to imitate\nmanipulation skills from in-the-wild video observations. Last but not least, we\nintroduce methods that enable robots to identify reusable skills from their\npast experiences, resulting in systems that can continually imitate multiple\ntasks in a sequential manner. Altogether, the contributions of this\ndissertation help lay the groundwork for building general-purpose personal\nrobots that can quickly adapt to new situations or tasks with low-cost data\ncollection and interact easily with humans.

We hypothesize\nthat the function in which humans control the position achieves better\nperformance and receives higher user ratings.

An interesting insight was that the supervisory role (when the\nrobot controls both position and force control) was rated second best in terms\nof subjective acceptance. Another surprising insight was that if position\ncontrol was delegated to the robot, the participants perceived much lower\nautonomy than when the force control was delegated to the robot.

    "abstract": "Entropic optimal transport -- the optimal transport problem regularized by KL\ndiver\\-gence -- is highly successful in statistical applications. Thanks to the\nsmoothness of the entropic coupling, its sample complexity avoids the curse of\ndimensionality suffered by unregularized optimal transport. The flip side of\nsmoothness is overspreading: the entropic coupling always has full support,\nwhereas the unregularized coupling that it approximates is usually sparse, even\ngiven by a map. Regularizing optimal transport by less-smooth $f$-divergences\nsuch as Tsallis divergence (i.e., $L^p$-regularization) is known to allow for\nsparse approximations, but is often thought to suffer from the curse of\ndimensionality as the couplings have limited differentiability and the dual is\nnot strongly concave. We refute this conventional wisdom and show, for a broad\nfamily of divergences, that the key empirical quantities converge at the\nparametric rate, independently of the dimension. More precisely, we provide\ncentral limit theorems for the optimal cost, the optimal coupling, and the dual\npotentials induced by i.i.d.\\ samples from the marginals. These results are\nobtained by a powerful yet elementary approach that is of broader interest for\nZ-estimation in function classes that are not Donsker.",

    "abstract": "Conformal interfaces play an important role in quantum critical systems. In\nclosed systems, the transmission properties of conformal interfaces are\ntypically characterized by two quantities: One is the effective central charge\n$c_{\\text{eff}}$, which measures the amount of quantum entanglement through the\ninterface, and the other is the transmission coefficient $c_{\\text{LR}}$, which\nmeasures the energy transmission through the interface. In the present work, to\ncharacterize the transmission property of conformal interfaces in open quantum\nsystems, we propose a third quantity $c_{\\text{relax}}$, which is defined\nthrough the ratio of Liouvillian gaps with and without an interface.\nPhysically, $c_{\\text{relax}}$ measures the suppression of the relaxation rate\ntowards a steady state when the system is subject to a local dissipation. We\nperform both analytical perturbation calculations and exact numerical\ncalculations based on a free fermion chain at the critical point. It is found\nthat $c_{\\text{relax}}$ decreases monotonically with the strength of the\ninterface. In particular, $0\\le c_{\\text{relax}}\\le c_{\\text{LR}}\\le\nc_{\\text{eff}}$, where the equalities hold if and only if the interface is\ntotally reflective or totally transmissive. Our result for $c_{\\text{relax}}$\nis universal in the sense that $c_{\\text{relax}}$ is independent of (i) the\ndissipation strength in the weak dissipation regime and (ii) the location where\nthe local dissipation is introduced. Comparing to the previously known\n$c_{\\text{LR}}$ and $c_{\\text{eff}}$ in a closed system, our $c_{\\text{relax}}$\nshows a distinct behavior as a function of the interface strength, suggesting\nits novelty to characterize conformal interfaces in open systems and offering\ninsights into critical systems under dissipation.",

This is particularly\nrestrictive when considering optimization problems beyond the quadratic order.\nHere, we introduce Ansatze based on an approximate quadratization of high-order\nHamiltonians which do not incur a qubit overhead. The price paid is a loss in\nthe quality of the noiseless solution. Crucially, this approximation yields\nshallower Ansatze which are more robust to noise than the standard QAOA one. We\nshow this through simulations of systems of 8 to 16 qubits with variable noise\nstrengths. Furthermore, we also propose a noise-aware Ansatz design method for\nquadratic optimization problems. This method implements only part of the\ncorresponding Hamiltonian by limiting the number of layers of SWAP gates in the\nAnsatz.

Extensive\nefforts surveying individual star forming regions with spectroscopy and\nnarrow-band photometry have been performed to derive accretion rates on large\npopulations of young stellar objects (YSOs). We use Gaia DR3 XP spectra to\nperform the first all-sky homogeneous analysis of YSO accretion within 500 pc.\nWe characterise the H$\\alpha$ line emission of YSOs by using the H$\\alpha$\npseudo-equivalent widths and XP spectra from Gaia DR3. We derive accretion\nluminosities, mass accretion rates and stellar parameters for 145 975 candidate\nYSO H$\\alpha$ emitters all-sky. We describe filtering strategies to select\nspecific sub-samples of YSOs from this catalogue. We identify a large\npopulation of low-accreting YSO candidates untraced by previous surveys. The\npopulation of low accreting YSOs is mostly spatially dispersed, away from star\nforming regions or more clustered environments of star formation. Many YSOs\nappear disconnected from young populations, reminiscent of 'Peter Pan' YSOs.

As\npart of the Munich Quantum Valley (MQV) ecosystem, the course fosters\ninterdisciplinary collaboration between technical and business students,\nequipping them with the skills necessary to contribute to or lead in the\nemerging quantum industry. The QEL curriculum integrates two complementary\ntracks. First, technical students form teams where they engage in cutting-edge,\nindustry-relevant research topics under academic supervision. Meanwhile\nbusiness students in a parallel course explore commercialization strategies,\nrisks, and opportunities within the quantum technology landscape. Midway\nthrough the semester, a selection of the business students join the technical\ncourse to form interdisciplinary teams which assess the feasibility of\ntransforming scientific concepts into viable business solutions. The course\nculminates in three key deliverables: a publication-style technical report, a\nwhite paper analyzing the business potential and financial requirements, and a\nstartup pitch presented to the quantum community at a Demo Day.

However, these velocities are influenced by the dynamics of the\ncircumstellar medium (CSM), which originates from the progenitor's late-phase\nmass loss. Cas A, the youngest known Galactic core-collapse SNR, was studied to\nanalyze the spatial distribution of Si and S radial velocities using two\nhigh-spectral resolution observations from the XRISM-Resolve imaging\nspectrometer.Resolve's capabilities enabled the detailed characterization of Si\nXIII, Si XIV, S XV, and S XVI lines, whose line shapes can be resolved and\nmodeled using Gaussian radial-velocity components. The radial velocities\nmeasured generally align with previous CCD-based results, confirming that they\nwere not artifacts caused by blended lines or ionization variations. Modeling\nline profiles with two-component Gaussians improved fits in some regions,\nrevealing distinct redshifted (backside) and blueshifted (frontside) components\nonly in a few specific areas. In most regions, however, both components were\neither both redshifted (northwest) or both blueshifted (southeast), consistent\nwith the patchy ejecta shell morphology seen in optically emitting fast-moving\nknots. The individual line components revealed a line broadening ranging from\n$\\sigma_v \\approx 200$ to $\\sigma_v \\approx 2000$ km/s. Components with $1000\n\\lesssim \\sigma_v \\lesssim 2000$km/s are consistent with previously determined\nreverse shock velocities, suggesting non-equilibrated or partially equilibrated\nion temperatures. Narrow components with small radial velocities found near Cas\nA's projected center likely originate from shocked CSM plasma. But the low\nradial velocity and small $\\sigma_v$ defies identifying these components with\neither the frontside or backside of the SNR, or both.",

We revisit here the antiproton and antideuteron\nsignatures from PBH evaporation, relying on a lognormal PBH mass distribution,\nstate-of-the-art propagation models, and an improved coalescence model for\nfusion into antideuterons. Our predictions are then compared with AMS-02 data\non the antiproton flux. We find that the AMS-02 antiproton data severely\nconstrain the Galactic PBH density, setting bounds that depend significantly on\nthe parameters of the lognormal mass distribution, and that are comparable to\nor slightly stronger than bounds set from diverse messengers. We also discuss\nprospects for future detection of antideuterons. Given the bounds from AMS-02\nantiproton data, we predict that if antideuterons were to be measured by AMS-02\nor GAPS, since the secondary contribution is subdominant, they would clearly be\na signal of new physics, only part of which could, however, be explained by PBH\nevaporation.",

The mass distribution is\nmodeled using a flexible, piecewise-defined convergence profile that\ncharacterizes the azimuthally averaged surface mass density within the lensing\nfield, transitioning to a projected power-law form at larger radii where\nphase-space constraints complement lensing. Additional strong-lensing\nconstraints are incorporated via central aperture-mass measurements, enabling\nfull-scale mass reconstruction from the cluster core to the outskirts. We\nvalidate CLUMI+ using synthetic weak-lensing and phase-space data for a massive\ncluster from the IllustrisTNG simulations, demonstrating unbiased recovery of\nprojected and three-dimensional mass profiles and achieving 10%--30%\nimprovement in precision at large radii.

    "abstract": "The ZTF DR2 includes light curves of 3628 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), making\nit the largest low-redshift SNe Ia sample available. One central question for\nanalyses of SNe Ia is whether the remaining diversity of standardized\nluminosities arises in part from an intrinsic or extrinsic effect;\ncharacterized by the color-independent bimodality in progenitor population or\ncolor- and host- dependent diversity in dust extinction, respectively. In the\ninitial analyses of the volume-limited subset (z < 0.06; 945 SNe) of this\nsample from the ZTF collaboration, the authors reported evidences for the\nformer hypothesis, in contrast to many of the previous evidences for the dust\nhypothesis found across other largest high- and low- redshift SNe Ia samples.\nWe re-analyze the volume-limited ZTF SNe Ia in the same manner that previous\nsamples were analyzed and report consistency with trends seen in literature\nsamples and in support of the dust hypothesis. We find the following: 1. a\ncolor dependency in the canonical `mass-step' size for SNe, with red SNe having\na larger host-dependent residual step than blue SNe by 0.18 $\\pm$ 0.09 mag; 2.\na color-dependent difference in the Hubble residual scatter, with red SNe\nhaving a $\\sim$ 33% larger scatter than blue SNe at > 3$\\sigma$ significance;\n3. data's preference of a model that accounts for color-dependency over a\nsimple `step' model at $\\sim$ 3$\\sigma$; 4. the strongest evidence to date\n(3.5$\\sigma$) that the relationship between SN color, host-galaxy properties,\nand luminosity is continuous rather than characterized by a discrete step.\nAccounting for 3 and 4 with our new model, Host2D, yields a 4.0$\\sigma$\nimprovement over the mass-step model. We trace the difference in reported\nfindings to the fitting and analysis methods, in particular the model\ncomplexity allowed for the color-luminosity relation, rather than a difference\nin the sample itself.",

    "abstract": "The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, corrected for foreground\neffects, form the foundation of cosmology and support the Big Bang model. A\npreviously overlooked foreground component is the formation of massive\nearly-type galaxies (ETGs), which can no longer be ignored, particularly in\nlight of JWST's detection of massive, evolved systems at extreme redshifts (z >\n13). The rapid formation of massive ETGs has been advocated in galaxy evolution\nstudies for decades, and recent evidence has compelled even proponents of\nhierarchical mass assembly to acknowledge the fact that massive ETGs evolve\nquickly. Constraints from chemical evolution are particularly stringent.\nWithout both intense star formation and a top-heavy galaxy-wide initial mass\nfunction of stars (IMF), it is difficult to reconcile stellar population\nsynthesis models with the high metallicity and abundance patterns of alpha\nelements. We infer from previous studies that the progenitor cloud of each\nmassive ETG must have had a radius of approximately 400 kpc. Comparing this\nvalue to the average present-day separation of massive ETGs, their formation\nmay have occurred around 15 < z < 20. We consider this epoch of formation in a\nflat-LCDM cosmological context, incorporating the known and necessary\nproperties of massive ETGs. Such properties are encapsulated independently by\nthe integrated galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) theory. The massive ETG evolution\npresented in this work is consistent with recent advancements in stellar and\ngalaxy evolution, and is derived entirely without priors or constraints from\nthe CMB. Yet, it emerges as a non-negligible source of CMB foreground\ncontamination. Even in our most conservative estimates, massive ETGs account\nfor 1.4% up to the full present-day CMB energy density.",

    "abstract": "The Euclid survey aims to measure the spectroscopic redshift of emission-line\ngalaxies by identifying the H$\\,{\\alpha}$ line in their slitless spectra. This\nmethod is sensitive to the signal-to-noise ratio of the line, as noise\nfluctuations or other strong emission lines can be misidentified as\nH$\\,{\\alpha}$, depending on redshift. These effects lead to catastrophic\nredshift errors and the inclusion of interlopers in the sample. We forecast the\nimpact of such redshift errors on galaxy clustering measurements. In\nparticular, we study the effect of interloper contamination on the two-point\ncorrelation function (2PCF), the growth rate of structures, and the\nAlcock-Paczynski (AP) parameters. We analyze 1000 synthetic spectroscopic\ncatalogues, the EuclidLargeMocks, designed to match the area and selection\nfunction of the Data Release 1 (DR1) sample. We estimate the 2PCF of the\ncontaminated catalogues, isolating contributions from correctly identified\ngalaxies and from interlopers. We explore different models with increasing\ncomplexity to describe the measured 2PCF at fixed cosmology. Finally, we\nperform a cosmological inference and evaluate the systematic error on the\ninferred $f\\sigma_8$, $\\alpha_{\\parallel}$ and $\\alpha_{\\perp}$ values\nassociated with different models. Our results demonstrate that a minimal\nmodelling approach, which only accounts for an attenuation of the clustering\nsignal regardless of the type of contaminants, is sufficient to recover the\ncorrect values of $f\\sigma_8$, $\\alpha_{\\parallel}$, and $\\alpha_{\\perp}$ at\nDR1. The accuracy and precision of the estimated AP parameters are largely\ninsensitive to the presence of interlopers. The adoption of a minimal model\ninduces a 1%-3% systematic error on the growth rate of structure estimation,\ndepending on the redshift. However, this error remains smaller than the\nstatistical error expected for the Euclid DR1 analysis.",

However, efforts to\ndevelop closed-form analytic expressions that link SF with key influencing\nphysical variables, such as gas density and turbulence, remain challenging. In\nthis work, we leverage recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and use\nsymbolic regression (SR) techniques to produce the first data-driven,\nML-discovered analytic expressions for SF using the publicly available FIRE-2\nsimulation suites. Employing a pipeline based on training the genetic algorithm\nof SR from an open software package called PySR, in tandem with a custom loss\nfunction and a model selection technique which compares candidate equations to\nanalytic approaches to describing SF, we produce symbolic representations of a\npredictive model for the star formation rate surface density\n($\\Sigma_\\mathrm{SFR}$) averaged over both 10 Myr and 100 Myr based on eight\nextracted variables from FIRE-2 galaxies. The resulting model that PySR finds\nbest describes SF, on both averaging timescales, features equations that\nincorporates the surface density of gas, $\\Sigma_\\mathrm{gas}$, the velocity\ndispersion of gas $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{gas,~z}}$ and the surface density of stars\n$\\Sigma_\\mathrm{*}$. Furthermore, we find that the equations found for the\nlonger SFR timescale all converge to a scaling-relation-like equation, all of\nwhich also closely capture the intrinsic physical scatter of the data within\nthe Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) plane. This observed convergence to physically\ninterpretable scaling relations at longer SFR timescales demonstrates that our\nmethod successfully identifies robust physical relationships rather than\nfitting to stochastic fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Shape primitive abstraction, which decomposes complex 3D shapes into simple\ngeometric elements, plays a crucial role in human visual cognition and has\nbroad applications in computer vision and graphics. While recent advances in 3D\ncontent generation have shown remarkable progress, existing primitive\nabstraction methods either rely on geometric optimization with limited semantic\nunderstanding or learn from small-scale, category-specific datasets, struggling\nto generalize across diverse shape categories. We present PrimitiveAnything, a\nnovel framework that reformulates shape primitive abstraction as a primitive\nassembly generation task. PrimitiveAnything includes a shape-conditioned\nprimitive transformer for auto-regressive generation and an ambiguity-free\nparameterization scheme to represent multiple types of primitives in a unified\nmanner. The proposed framework directly learns the process of primitive\nassembly from large-scale human-crafted abstractions, enabling it to capture\nhow humans decompose complex shapes into primitive elements. Through extensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate that PrimitiveAnything can generate high-quality\nprimitive assemblies that better align with human perception while maintaining\ngeometric fidelity across diverse shape categories. It benefits various 3D\napplications and shows potential for enabling primitive-based user-generated\ncontent (UGC) in games. Project page: https://primitiveanything.github.io",

    "abstract": "The Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) is currently experiencing rapid\ngrowth, driven by the advanced capabilities of LLMs. Unlike earlier\nspecialists, existing MLLMs are evolving towards a Multimodal Generalist\nparadigm. Initially limited to understanding multiple modalities, these models\nhave advanced to not only comprehend but also generate across modalities. Their\ncapabilities have expanded from coarse-grained to fine-grained multimodal\nunderstanding and from supporting limited modalities to arbitrary ones. While\nmany benchmarks exist to assess MLLMs, a critical question arises: Can we\nsimply assume that higher performance across tasks indicates a stronger MLLM\ncapability, bringing us closer to human-level AI? We argue that the answer is\nnot as straightforward as it seems. This project introduces General-Level, an\nevaluation framework that defines 5-scale levels of MLLM performance and\ngenerality, offering a methodology to compare MLLMs and gauge the progress of\nexisting systems towards more robust multimodal generalists and, ultimately,\ntowards AGI. At the core of the framework is the concept of Synergy, which\nmeasures whether models maintain consistent capabilities across comprehension\nand generation, and across multiple modalities. To support this evaluation, we\npresent General-Bench, which encompasses a broader spectrum of skills,\nmodalities, formats, and capabilities, including over 700 tasks and 325,800\ninstances. The evaluation results that involve over 100 existing\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs uncover the capability rankings of generalists,\nhighlighting the challenges in reaching genuine AI. We expect this project to\npave the way for future research on next-generation multimodal foundation\nmodels, providing a robust infrastructure to accelerate the realization of AGI.\nProject page: https://generalist.top/",

To this end, we propose FarSight, a unified\nend-to-end system for person recognition that integrates complementary\nbiometric cues across face, gait, and body shape modalities. FarSight\nincorporates novel algorithms across four core modules: multi-subject detection\nand tracking, recognition-aware video restoration, modality-specific biometric\nfeature encoding, and quality-guided multi-modal fusion. These components are\ndesigned to work cohesively under degraded image conditions, large pose and\nscale variations, and cross-domain gaps. Extensive experiments on the BRIAR\ndataset, one of the most comprehensive benchmarks for long-range, multi-modal\nbiometric recognition, demonstrate the effectiveness of FarSight. Compared to\nour preliminary system, this system achieves a 34.1% absolute gain in 1:1\nverification accuracy (TAR@0.1% FAR), a 17.8% increase in closed-set\nidentification (Rank-20), and a 34.3% reduction in open-set identification\nerrors (FNIR@1% FPIR).

We\nfocus on post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn (PQ) breaking axion models that are\ncosmologically safe. Recent work has shown that a greater number of such models\nexist. This is because the heavy quarks required for the colour anomaly can\nprovoke a period of heavy quark domination (HQD), which, through decay, dilutes\nthe axion abundance. In this work we show for the first time that the axion\ndark matter mass can be as low as $m_a\\sim10^{-8}\\,{\\rm eV}$ for models where\nthe heavy quarks decay via dimension 6 terms. This is achieved by allowing the\nmass of the heavy quarks to differ from the axion decay constant, $m_Q\\neq\nf_a$. Consequently, the observables that would distinguish between pre- and\npost-inflationary PQ breaking, $m_a$ and the additional relativistic degrees of\nfreedom $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$, now become indiscernible. To solve this, we\npropose using blue-tilted IGWs to probe HQD. By leveraging the features of the\nGW signal, future interferometers can probe $m_Q$ and $f_a$ complementing the\nsensitivity of haloscope experiments, potentially pinning down all relevant\nparameter that describe the physics.

    "abstract": "We present CAPERS-LRD-z9, a little red dot (LRD) which we confirm to be a\n$z=9.288$ broad-line AGN (BLAGN). First identified as a high-redshift LRD\ncandidate from PRIMER NIRCam photometry, follow-up NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy\nof CAPERS-LRD-z9 from the CANDELS-Area Prism Epoch of Reionization Survey\n(CAPERS) has revealed a broad $3500$ km s$^{-1}$ H$\\beta$ emission line and\nnarrow [O III]$\\lambda\\lambda4959,5007$ lines, indicative of a BLAGN. Based on\nthe broad H$\\beta$ line, we compute a canonical black-hole mass of\n$\\log(M_{\\textrm{BH}}/M_{\\odot})=7.58\\pm0.15$, although full consideration of\nsystematic uncertainties yields a conservative range of\n$6.65<\\log(M_{\\textrm{BH}}/M_{\\odot})<8.50$. These observations suggest that\neither a massive black hole seed, or a lighter stellar remnant seed undergoing\nperiods of super-Eddington accretion, is necessary to grow such a massive black\nhole in $\\lesssim500$ Myr of cosmic time. CAPERS-LRD-z9 exhibits a strong\nBalmer break, consistent with a central AGN surrounded by dense ($\\sim\n10^{10}\\textrm{ cm}^{-3}$) neutral gas. We model CAPERS-LRD-z9 using CLOUDY to\nfit the emission red-ward of the Balmer break with a dense gas-enshrouded AGN,\nand bagpipes to fit the rest-ultraviolet emission as a host-galaxy stellar\npopulation. This upper limit on the stellar mass of the host galaxy\n($<10^9\\,{\\rm M_\\odot}$) implies that the black-hole to stellar mass ratio may\nbe extremely large, possibly $>5\\%$ (although systematic uncertainties on the\nblack-hole mass prevent strong conclusions). However, the shape of the UV\ncontinuum differs from typical high-redshift star-forming galaxies, indicating\nthat this UV emission may also be of AGN origin, and hence the true stellar\nmass of the host may be still lower.",

Methods for nonparametric sequential testing\n-- especially conformal test martingales (CTMs) and anytime-valid inference --\noffer promising tools for this monitoring task.

In this paper, we address\nthese limitations by proposing a weighted generalization of conformal test\nmartingales (WCTMs), which lay a theoretical foundation for online monitoring\nfor any unexpected changepoints in the data distribution while controlling\nfalse-alarms. For practical applications, we propose specific WCTM algorithms\nthat adapt online to mild covariate shifts (in the marginal input\ndistribution), quickly detect harmful shifts, and diagnose those harmful shifts\nas concept shifts (in the conditional label distribution) or extreme\n(out-of-support) covariate shifts that cannot be easily adapted to.

With advances in large language models (LLMs), this\ntask has gained increasing attention, and several benchmarks are proposed to\nevaluate the issue resolution ability of LLMs. However, existing benchmarks\nhave three main limitations. First, current benchmarks focus on a single\nprogramming language, limiting the evaluation of issues from repositories\nacross different languages. Second, they usually cover a narrow range of\ndomains, which may fail to represent the diversity of real-world issues. Third,\nexisting benchmarks rely solely on textual information in issue descriptions,\noverlooking multimodal information such as images in issues. In this paper, we\npropose OmniGIRL, a GitHub Issue ResoLution benchmark that is multilingual,\nmultimodal, and multi-domain. OmniGIRL includes 959 task instances, which are\ncollected from repositories across four programming languages (i.e., Python,\nJavaScript, TypeScript, and Java) and eight different domains. Our evaluation\nshows that current LLMs show limited performances on OmniGIRL. Notably, the\nbest-performing model, GPT-4o, resolves only 8.6% of the issues.

A challenge\nin studying the impact of DM on neutron stars is the absence of a universally\naccepted nuclear-matter equation of state (EOS), making it difficult to\ndistinguish between the effects of DM and various EOS models. To address this\nissue, we extend the study of the I-Love-Q universal relations of neutron stars\nto FBSs with a nonrotating bosonic component by solving the\nEinstein-Klein-Gordon system. We study how DM parameters, such as the boson\nparticle mass and self-interaction strength, would affect the structure of FBSs\nand explore the parameter space that leads to deviations from the I-Love-Q\nrelations. The properties of FBSs and the level of deviations in general depend\nsensitively on the DM parameters. For boson particle mass within the range of\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{eV})$, where the Compton wavelength is\ncomparable to the Schwarzschild radius of a $1 M_\\odot$ star, the deviation is\nup to about 5% level if the star contains a few percent of DM admixture. The\ndeviation increases significantly with a higher amount of DM. We also find that\nthe universal relations are still valid to within a 1% deviation level for\nboson particle mass $m_b \\geq 26.8\\times10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{eV}$. This\neffectively sets an upper bound on the boson particle mass, beyond which it\nbecomes not feasible to probe the properties of FBSs by investigating the\nI-Love-Q relation violations.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose Adaptive Bayesian Inference\n(ABI), a framework that bypasses traditional data-space discrepancies and\ninstead compares distributions directly in posterior space through\nnonparametric distribution matching. By leveraging a novel Marginally-augmented\nSliced Wasserstein (MSW) distance on posterior measures and exploiting its\nquantile representation, ABI transforms the challenging problem of measuring\ndivergence between posterior distributions into a tractable sequence of\none-dimensional conditional quantile regression tasks. Moreover, we introduce a\nnew adaptive rejection sampling scheme that iteratively refines the posterior\napproximation by updating the proposal distribution via generative density\nestimation. Theoretically, we establish parametric convergence rates for the\ntrimmed MSW distance and prove that the ABI posterior converges to the true\nposterior as the tolerance threshold vanishes. Through extensive empirical\nevaluation, we demonstrate that ABI significantly outperforms data-based\nWasserstein ABC, summary-based ABC, and state-of-the-art likelihood-free\nsimulators, especially in high-dimensional or dependent observation regimes.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for optimizing the scheduling and\ncontrol of Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras in dynamic surveillance environments.\nThe proposed method integrates Kalman filters for motion prediction with a\ndynamic network flow model to enhance real-time video capture efficiency. By\nassigning Kalman filters to tracked objects, the system predicts future\nlocations, enabling precise scheduling of camera tasks. This prediction-driven\napproach is formulated as a network flow optimization, ensuring scalability and\nadaptability to various surveillance scenarios. To further reduce redundant\nmonitoring, we also incorporate group-tracking nodes, allowing multiple objects\nto be captured within a single camera focus when appropriate. In addition, a\nvalue-based system is introduced to prioritize camera actions, focusing on the\ntimely capture of critical events. By adjusting the decay rates of these values\nover time, the system ensures prompt responses to tasks with imminent\ndeadlines. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this approach improves\ncoverage, reduces average wait times, and minimizes missed events compared to\ntraditional master-slave camera systems. Overall, our method significantly\nenhances the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of surveillance\nsystems, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments.",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting 3D attributes is crucial for monocular 3D object\ndetection (Mono3D), with depth estimation posing the greatest challenge due to\nthe inherent ambiguity in mapping 2D images to 3D space. While existing methods\nleverage multiple depth cues (e.g., estimating depth uncertainty, modeling\ndepth error) to improve depth accuracy, they overlook that accurate depth\nprediction requires conditioning on other 3D attributes, as these attributes\nare intrinsically inter-correlated through the 3D to 2D projection, which\nultimately limits overall accuracy and stability. Inspired by Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) in large language models (LLMs), this paper proposes MonoCoP, which\nleverages a Chain-of-Prediction (CoP) to predict attributes sequentially and\nconditionally via three key designs. First, it employs a lightweight\nAttributeNet (AN) for each 3D attribute to learn attribute-specific features.\nNext, MonoCoP constructs an explicit chain to propagate these learned features\nfrom one attribute to the next. Finally, MonoCoP uses a residual connection to\naggregate features for each attribute along the chain, ensuring that later\nattribute predictions are conditioned on all previously processed attributes\nwithout forgetting the features of earlier ones. Experimental results show that\nour MonoCoP achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on the KITTI\nleaderboard without requiring additional data and further surpasses existing\nmethods on the Waymo and nuScenes frontal datasets.",

This research agenda has two aims: to describe the\nstrategic landscape of AI development and to catalog important governance\nresearch questions. These questions, if answered, would provide important\ninsight on how to successfully reduce catastrophic risks.\n  We describe four high-level scenarios for the geopolitical response to\nadvanced AI development, cataloging the research questions most relevant to\neach. Our favored scenario involves building the technical, legal, and\ninstitutional infrastructure required to internationally restrict dangerous AI\ndevelopment and deployment (which we refer to as an Off Switch), which leads\ninto an internationally coordinated Halt on frontier AI activities at some\npoint in the future. The second scenario we describe is a US National Project\nfor AI, in which the US Government races to develop advanced AI systems and\nestablish unilateral control over global AI development. We also describe two\nadditional scenarios: a Light-Touch world similar to that of today and a Threat\nof Sabotage situation where countries use sabotage and deterrence to slow AI\ndevelopment.\n  In our view, apart from the Off Switch and Halt scenario, all of these\ntrajectories appear to carry an unacceptable risk of catastrophic harm.

Recent research has\nexplored using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve LLMs' search capabilities\nby interacting with live search engines in real-world environments. While these\napproaches show promising results, they face two major challenges: (1)\nUncontrolled Document Quality: The quality of documents returned by search\nengines is often unpredictable, introducing noise and instability into the\ntraining process. (2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires\nfrequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search\nrequests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain\nscalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a novel RL\nframework that incentivizes the capabilities of LLMs to use a real search\nengine with simulated searches during training. Our approach begins with\nlightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module\ncapable of generating both useful and noisy documents in response to a query.\nDuring RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that\nincrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively\neliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly\nchallenging retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nZeroSearch effectively incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs using a 3B\nLLM as the retrieval module. Remarkably, a 7B retrieval module achieves\ncomparable performance to the real search engine, while a 14B retrieval module\neven surpasses it. Furthermore, it generalizes well across both base and\ninstruction-tuned models of various parameter sizes and is compatible with a\nwide range of RL algorithms.",

    "abstract": "We describe a demonstration of a prototype approach to clear the laser focal\nvolume of free electrons and disable their atomic and molecular sources.\nEmploying two temporally separated, copropagating pulses, we exploited a\npump-probe setup in our experiment. The pump ionized a low-density gas and\nexpelled free and nascent electrons from its focal volume. The probe,\ntraversing the same focal volume, expelled any remaining free and probe-induced\nnascent electrons. We gauged the effectiveness of the approach by capturing the\nspatial distribution of ejected electrons with image plates while we varied the\nrelative intensity and time delay between the pump and probe. When we injected\nthe pump 300 fs before the probe, we found the electron spatial distribution\nsignificantly altered and the yield suppressed, proving ponderomotive expulsion\nworks. However, the yield was enhanced when we set the temporal spacing between\nthe pump and probe to 150 fs. Simulations show the enhancement is due to Airy\nrings of the focused pump expelling electrons inward toward the propagation\naxis. Our results show that the complete removal of focal-volume electrons was\ninhibited by spatial overlap fluctuations and the stronger probe generating\nionization outside the cleared-volume of the pump. We discuss ways to mitigate\nthese impediments and propose alternate two-beam arrangements to achieve more\nefficient focal-volume clearing.",

Here we present the first multi-institutional\ncomparison of the impacts of four well-established active learning methods\n(ISLE, Peer Instruction, Tutorials, and SCALE-UP) on conceptual learning. We\nalso investigate student development of peer networks and the activities that\ntake place during instruction to explain differences in these impacts.

We find measurable increases in student conceptual learning in all\nfour active learning methods (ranging from 2.09-sigma to 6.22-sigma differences\nfrom a null effect), and significantly larger conceptual learning gains in\nSCALE-UP than in both ISLE (2.25-sigma difference) and Peer Instruction\n(2.54-sigma difference).

Instead, we observe differences in\nclassroom activities; in many of the observed ISLE and Peer Instruction\ncourses, instructors lecture for a large fraction of class time.

    "abstract": "Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) exhibit scintillation and scattering, often\nattributed to interactions with plasma screens in the Milky Way and the host\ngalaxy. When these two screens appear \"point-like\" to each other, two scales of\nscintillation can be observed with sufficient frequency resolution. A screen\nperceives a second screen as extended or resolved when the angular size of the\nlatter is smaller than the angular resolution of the former. We define the\nratio of these two as the Resolution Power (RP). Previous observational studies\nhave argued that, in the resolving regime, scintillations disappear, assuming\nthat a screen resolving another screen is equivalent to a screen resolving an\nincoherent emission region. In this theoretical and simulation-based study of\nresolving effects in two-screen scenarios, we argue that resolving quenches\nonly the relatively broad-scale scintillation and that this quenching is a\ngradual process. We present qualitative and quantitative predictions for\ndynamic spectra, spectral autocorrelation functions (ACF), and modulation\nindices in resolved and unresolved regimes of two-screen systems. We show that\nthe spectral ACF of a two-screen system has a product term in addition to the\nsum of individual screen contributions, causing the total modulation index to\nrise to \\sqrt(3) in the unresolved regime. To aid in discovering resolving\nsystems, we also present observable trends in multi-frequency observations of a\nscreen resolving another screen or incoherent emission. Additionally we\nintroduce a new formula to estimate the distance between the FRB and the screen\nin its host galaxy. We also show that this formula, like previous ones in the\nliterature, is only applicable to screens that are two-dimensional in the plane\nof the sky.",

Although\nprompt-based methods effectively store multi-domain knowledge in prompt\nparameters and obtain advanced performance through cross-domain prompt fusion,\nwe reveal an intrinsic limitation: component-wise misalignment between\ndomain-specific prompts leads to conflicting knowledge integration and degraded\npredictions. This arises from the random positioning of knowledge components\nwithin prompts, where irrelevant component fusion introduces interference.To\naddress this, we propose Componential Prompt-Knowledge Alignment (KA-Prompt), a\nnovel prompt-based DIL method that introduces component-aware prompt-knowledge\nalignment during training, significantly improving both the learning and\ninference capacity of the model. KA-Prompt operates in two phases: (1) Initial\nComponential Structure Configuring, where a set of old prompts containing\nknowledge relevant to the new domain are mined via greedy search, which is then\nexploited to initialize new prompts to achieve reusable knowledge transfer and\nestablish intrinsic alignment between new and old prompts. (2) Online Alignment\nPreservation, which dynamically identifies the target old prompts and applies\nadaptive componential consistency constraints as new prompts evolve.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a methodology for automatically generating processors\nthat support a subset of the RISC-V instruction set for a new class of\napplications at Extreme Edge. The electronics used in extreme edge applications\nmust be power-efficient, but also provide additional qualities, such as low\ncost, conformability, comfort and sustainability. Flexible electronics, rather\nthan silicon-based electronics, will be capable of meeting these qualities. For\nthis purpose, we propose a methodology to generate RISPs (RISC-V instruction\nsubset processors) customised to extreme edge applications and to implement\nthem as flexible integrated circuits (FlexICs). The methodology is unique in\nthe sense that verification is an integral part of design. The RISP methodology\ntreats each instruction in the ISA as a discrete, fully functional,\npre-verified hardware block. It automatically builds a custom processor by\nstitching together the hardware blocks of the instructions required by an\napplication or a set of applications in a specific domain. This approach\nsignificantly reduces the processor verification and its time-to-market. We\ngenerate RISPs using this methodology for three extreme edge applications, and\nembedded applications from the Embench benchmark suite, synthesize them as\nFlexICs, and compare their power, performance and area to the baselines. Our\nresults show that RISPs generated using this methodology achieve, on average,\n30% reductions in power and area compared to a RISC-V processor supporting the\nfull instruction set when synthesized, and are nearly 30 times more energy\nefficient with respect to Serv - the world's smallest 32-bit RISC-V processor.\nIn addition, the full physical implementation of RISPs show up to 21% and 26%\nless area and power than Serv.",

To address these challenges, we propose a learning\napproach that directly infers both low- and high-level task representations\nfrom user demonstrations on the real system. We developed an unsupervised task\nsegmentation algorithm that combines intention recognition and feature\nclustering to infer the skills of a task.

    "abstract": "In a rendezvous task, a set of mobile agents dispersed in a network have to\ngather at an arbitrary common site. We consider the rendezvous problem on the\ninfinite labeled line, with $2$ initially asleep agents, without communication,\nand a synchronous notion of time. Nodes are labeled with unique positive\nintegers. The initial distance between the two agents is denoted by $D$. Time\nis divided into rounds. We count time from when an agent first wakes up, and\ndenote by $\\tau$ the delay between the agents' wake up times. If awake in a\ngiven round $T$, an agent has three options: stay at its current node $v$, take\nport $0$, or take port $1$. If it decides to stay, the agent is still at node\n$v$ in round $T+1$. Otherwise, it is at one of the two neighbors of $v$ on the\nline, based on the port it chose. The agents achieve rendezvous in $T$ rounds\nif they are at the same node in round $T$. We aim for a deterministic algorithm\nfor this task.\n  The problem was recently considered by Miller and Pelc [DISC 2023]. With\n$\\ell_{\\max}$ the largest label of the two starting nodes, they showed that no\nalgorithm can guarantee rendezvous in $o(D \\log^* \\ell_{\\max})$ rounds. The\nlower bound follows from a connection with the LOCAL model of distributed\ncomputing, and holds even if the agents are guaranteed simultaneous wake-up\n($\\tau = 0$) and are given $D$ as advice. Miller and Pelc also gave an\nalgorithm of optimal matching complexity $O(D \\log^* \\ell_{\\max})$ when $D$ is\nknown to the agents, but only obtained the higher bound of $O(D^2 (\\log^*\n\\ell_{\\max})^3)$ when $D$ is unknown.\n  We improve this second complexity to a tight $O(D \\log^* \\ell_{\\max})$. In\nfact, our algorithm achieves rendezvous in $O(D \\log^* \\ell_{\\min})$ rounds,\nwhere $\\ell_{\\min}$ is the smallest label within distance $O(D)$ of the two\nstarting positions.",

It has become an effective training paradigm due to the\nbroader supervision information provided by the teacher distribution compared\nto one-hot labels. We identify that the core challenge in KD lies in balancing\ntwo mode-concentration effects: the \\textbf{\\textit{Hardness-Concentration}}\neffect, which refers to focusing on modes with large errors, and the\n\\textbf{\\textit{Confidence-Concentration}} effect, which refers to focusing on\nmodes with high student confidence. Through an analysis of how probabilities\nare reassigned during gradient updates, we observe that these two effects are\nentangled in FKLD and RKLD, but in extreme forms. Specifically, both are too\nweak in FKLD, causing the student to fail to concentrate on the target class.\nIn contrast, both are too strong in RKLD, causing the student to overly\nemphasize the target class while ignoring the broader distributional\ninformation from the teacher. To address this imbalance, we propose ABKD, a\ngeneric framework with $\\alpha$-$\\beta$-divergence.

    "abstract": "Orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT) offers a true realization of\nthe Hohenberg-Kohn theorems, enabling full quantum-mechanical studies of\nelectronic systems based solely on electron densities. However, OFDFT remains\nlimited by the difficulty of formulating accurate kinetic-energy density\nfunctionals. In this paper, we substantially enhance the accuracy of OFDFT\nenergies and densities by tuning, during density initialization, the parameter\n$\\mu$ of the APBEK functional, which arises in the second-order gradient\nexpansion of the kinetic energy for semiclassical neutral atoms. We augment\nthis parameterized APBEK functional with two physically-motivated,\nnon-empirical corrections derived from Kato's cusp condition and the virial\ntheorem. The resulting functional, which we call MuAPBEK, is benchmarked\nagainst Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) on atoms, organic molecules\nfrom the QM9 dataset, and the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. MuAPBEK achieves\nmuch lower energy errors than standard APBEK and Thomas-Fermi-von-Weizsacker\nfunctionals, even when the latter two are evaluated on converged KSDFT\ndensities. Its mean absolute energy errors on atoms and molecules are 161 and\n122 kcal/mol, respectively, indicating that MuAPBEK's errors do not scale with\nsystem size. MuAPBEK also yields accurate densities, with a mean integrated\nabsolute density error of 1.8 electrons for molecules. Importantly, one step of\nour density optimization scheme is at least ten times faster than a single\nKSDFT self-consistent field cycle and exhibits a lower-order computational time\ncomplexity of $O(N^{1.96})$ with respect to system size, $N$. Our results\nindicate that highly-accurate OFDFT for large-scale quantum simulations beyond\nthe practical limits of KSDFT is within reach.",

    "abstract": "Simulating the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation requires finding the\nunitary operator that efficiently describes the time evolution. One of the\nfundamental tools to efficiently simulate quantum dynamics is the Trotter\ndecomposition of the time-evolution operator, and various quantum-classical\nhybrid algorithms have been proposed to implement Trotterization. Given that\nsome quantum hardware is publicly accessible, it is important to assess the\npractical performance of Trotterization on them. However, a straightforward\nTrotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian often leads to quantum circuits with\nlarge depth, which hinders accurate simulation on devices with limited\ncoherence time. In this work, we propose a hardware-efficient Trotterization\nscheme for the time evolution of a 3-site, $J=1$ XXX Heisenberg model. By\nexploiting the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, we derive an effective Hamiltonian\nthat acts on a reduced subspace, significantly lowering the circuit depth after\noptimization for specific evolution times. This approach can be interpreted as\na change of basis in the standard Trotterization scheme. We also test our\nmethod on the IBM Quantum device ibmq_jakarta. Combining with the readout error\nmitigation and the zero-noise extrapolation, we obtain the fidelity $0.9928 \\pm\n0.0013$ for the simulation of the time evolution of the Heisenberg model from\nthe time $t=0$ to $t=\\pi$.",

    "abstract": "Complex systems, such as small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) swarms\ndispatched for emergency response, often require dynamic reconfiguration at\nruntime under the supervision of human operators. This introduces\nhuman-on-the-loop requirements, where evolving needs shape ongoing system\nfunctionality and behaviors. While traditional personas support upfront, static\nrequirements elicitation, we propose a persona-based advocate framework for\nruntime requirements engineering to provide ethically informed, safety-driven,\nand regulatory-aware decision support. Our approach extends standard personas\ninto event-driven personas. When triggered by events such as adverse\nenvironmental conditions, evolving mission state, or operational constraints,\nthe framework updates the sUAS operator's view of the personas, ensuring\nrelevance to current conditions. We create three key advocate personas, namely\nSafety Controller, Ethical Governor, and Regulatory Auditor, to manage\ntrade-offs among risk, ethical considerations, and regulatory compliance. We\nperform a proof-of-concept validation in an emergency response scenario using\nsUAS, showing how our advocate personas provide context-aware guidance grounded\nin safety, regulatory, and ethical constraints. By evolving static, design-time\npersonas into adaptive, event-driven advocates, the framework surfaces\nmission-critical runtime requirements in response to changing conditions. These\nrequirements shape operator decisions in real time, aligning actions with the\noperational demands of the moment.",

This is a\nsignificant improvement because $ \\epsilon $-transitions add considerable\nexpressive power (making it possible to jump to multiple states for free) and\ncapture the complexity of regular expressions (through Thompson's construction\nfor converting a regular expression into an equivalent automaton).

While this implies a violation of momentum conservation,\nno logical inconsistencies arise in this deviant ``Newtonian'' limit. In\ncontrast, due to Bianchi identities, the relativistic theory must undergo core\nchange, and we discuss a modification of Einstein's gravity capable of coupling\na non-conserved source to gravity. It results from fixing some of the spatial\ncomponents of the metric, thereby constraining the possible diffeomorphisms and\nclipping some of the equations. Bianchi identities can always be used to refill\nthe equations, but the effective Stueckelberg stresses are so outlandish that\nthis defines symmetry breakdown and violations of local energy-momentum\nconservation. We work out spherically symmetric solutions with static halos and\nflat rotation curves, with and without a central black hole. The model has the\ndrawback that it can evade experimental constraints simply by setting to zero\nthe local density of deviant matter (which is a non-dynamic input). Its\npresence, in contrast, would leave inimitable signatures. We briefly discuss\nthe Hamiltonian formulation of these models, where such dark matter appears as\na central charge in the Poisson bracket of the Hamiltonian and the momentum.",

    "abstract": "Cosmic strings are predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model and\nconstitute a plausible source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early\nUniverse. In a previous article [1], we pointed out that the GW spectrum from a\npopulation of string loops in the scaling regime can exhibit a sharp cutoff\nfrequency associated with the fundamental oscillation mode of string loops. In\nthis paper, we study the effect of particle decay due to kink-kink collisions\nand cusps on the GW spectrum in the nonscaling scenario introduced in Ref. [2].\nWe find analytical conditions for the existence of a cutoff frequency in the\nfundamental spectrum and provide expressions for this frequency. In large\nregions of parameter space, our results in the nonscaling model turn out to be\nidentical to those in the scaling model. Finally, we demonstrate how the\nspectrum changes when transitioning from the regime with a cutoff frequency to\nthe regime without a cutoff frequency. Our analytical estimates are validated\nat qualitatively different benchmark points by comparing them with numerical\nspectra.",

    "abstract": "Lightness, sparsity, and hop-diameter are the fundamental parameters of\ngeometric spanners. Arya et al. [STOC'95] showed in their seminal work that\nthere exists a construction of Euclidean $(1+\\varepsilon)$-spanners with\nhop-diameter $O(\\log n)$ and lightness $O(\\log n)$. They also gave a general\ntradeoff of hop-diameter $k$ and sparsity $O(\\alpha_k(n))$, where $\\alpha_k$ is\na very slowly growing inverse of an Ackermann-style function. The former\ncombination of logarithmic hop-diameter and lightness is optimal due to the\nlower bound by Dinitz et al. [FOCS'08]. Later, Elkin and Solomon [STOC'13]\ngeneralized the light spanner construction to doubling metrics and extended the\ntradeoff for more values of hop-diameter $k$. In a recent line of work\n[SoCG'22, SoCG'23], Le et al. proved that the aforementioned tradeoff between\nthe hop-diameter and sparsity is tight for every choice of hop-diameter $k$. A\nfundamental question remains: What is the optimal tradeoff between the\nhop-diameter and lightness for every value of $k$?\n  In this paper, we present a general framework for constructing light spanners\nwith small hop-diameter. Our framework is based on tree covers. In particular,\nwe show that if a metric admits a tree cover with $\\gamma$ trees, stretch $t$,\nand lightness $L$, then it also admits a $t$-spanner with hop-diameter $k$ and\nlightness $O(kn^{2/k}\\cdot \\gamma L)$. Further, we note that the tradeoff for\ntrees is tight due to a construction in uniform line metric, which is perhaps\nthe simplest tree metric. As a direct consequence of this framework, we obtain\na tight tradeoff between lightness and hop-diameter for doubling metrics in the\nentire regime of $k$.",

This opens one\nof the most exciting frontiers in FL: fine-tuning LMs. Yet, a persistent\nchallenge in FL is the frequent, rigid communication of parameters -- a problem\nmagnified by the sheer size of these contemporary models. The FedOpt family of\nalgorithms has become the go-to approach for FL, relying on fixed but arbitrary\nintervals for model exchanges. Recently, the FDA algorithm prescribed a dynamic\napproach by monitoring the training progress. However, it introduced a\nhard-to-calibrate parameter and imposed a rigid synchronization scheme. In this\nwork, we address these limitations by proposing the FDA-Opt family of\nalgorithms -- a unified generalization of both FDA and FedOpt. Our experimental\nevaluation focuses on fine-tuning LMs on downstream NLP tasks and demonstrates\nthat FDA-Opt outperforms FedOpt even when it is configured with\nhyper-parameters specifically optimized for the latter. In other words, we show\nthat FDA-Opt is a practical, drop-in replacement for FedOpt in modern FL\nlibraries and systems: it requires no additional configuration and delivers\nsuperior performance out of the box.",

However, most prior work either focuses on\npower grasping, which simply involves holding an object still, or relies on\ncostly teleoperated robot demonstrations to teach robots how to grasp each\nobject functionally. Instead, we propose extracting human grasp information\nfrom web images since they depict natural and functional object interactions,\nthereby bypassing the need for curated demonstrations. We reconstruct human\nhand-object interaction (HOI) 3D meshes from RGB images, retarget the human\nhand to multi-finger robot hands, and align the noisy object mesh with its\naccurate 3D shape. We show that these relatively low-quality HOI data from\ninexpensive web sources can effectively train a functional grasping model. To\nfurther expand the grasp dataset for seen and unseen objects, we use the\ninitially-trained grasping policy with web data in the IsaacGym simulator to\ngenerate physically feasible grasps while preserving functionality. We train\nthe grasping model on 10 object categories and evaluate it on 9 unseen objects,\nincluding challenging items such as syringes, pens, spray bottles, and tongs,\nwhich are underrepresented in existing datasets.

The\nreaching of such tipping points does not only impact other tipping elements\nthrough their connections, but can also have further effect on the global mean\nsurface temperature (GMT) itself, either increasing or decreasing the\nprobability of further tipping points being reached. Recently, a numerical\nstudy analyzing the risk of tipping cascades has been conducted, using a\nconceptual model describing the dynamics of a tipping element with its\ninteractions with other tipping elements taken into account [1]. Here, we\nextend the model substantially by including adaptation, so that the\nGMT-feedback induced by the crossing of a tipping point is incorporated as\nwell. We find that although the adaptive mechanism does not impact the risk for\nthe occurrence of tipping events, large tipping cascades are less probable due\nto the negative GMT-feedback of the ocean circulation systems. Furthermore,\nseveral tipping elements can play a different role in cascades in the adaptive\nmodel. In particular, the Amazon rainforest could be a trigger in a tipping\ncascade. Overall, the adaptation mechanism tends to slightly stabilize the\nnetwork.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an integrated equilibrium model to characterize the\ncomplex interactions between electrified logistics systems and electric power\ndelivery systems. The model consists of two major players: an electrified\nlogistics operator (ELO) and a power system operator (PSO). The ELO aims to\nmaximize its profit by strategically scheduling and routing its electric\ndelivery vehicles (e-trucks) for deliveries and charging, in response to the\nlocational marginal price (LMP) set by the PSO. The routing, delivery, and\ncharging behaviors of e-trucks are modeled by a perturbed utility Markov\ndecision process (PU-MDP) while their collective operations are optimized to\nachieve the ELO's objective by designing rewards in the PU-MDP. On the other\nhand, PSO optimizes the energy price by considering both the spatiotemporal\ne-truck charging demand and the base electricity load. The equilibrium of the\nintegrated system is formulated as a fixed point, proved to exist under mild\nassumptions, and solved for a case study on the Hawaii network via Anderson's\nfixed-point acceleration algorithm. Along with these numerical results, this\npaper provides both theoretical insights and practical guidelines to achieve\nsustainable and efficient operations in modern electrified logistics and power\nsystems.",

This paper presents the first systematic review focused specifically on\nstrategies to address data scarcity in generative language modelling for\nlow-resource languages (LRL). Drawing from 54 studies, we identify, categorise\nand evaluate technical approaches, including monolingual data augmentation,\nback-translation, multilingual training, and prompt engineering, across\ngenerative tasks. We also analyse trends in architecture choices, language\nfamily representation, and evaluation methods.

We conclude with\nrecommendations for extending these methods to a wider range of LRLs and\noutline open challenges in building equitable generative language systems.\nUltimately, this review aims to support researchers and developers in building\ninclusive AI tools for underrepresented languages, a necessary step toward\nempowering LRL speakers and the preservation of linguistic diversity in a world\nincreasingly shaped by large-scale language technologies.",

    "abstract": "Visible and infrared image fusion is one of the most crucial tasks in the\nfield of image fusion, aiming to generate fused images with clear structural\ninformation and high-quality texture features for high-level vision tasks.\nHowever, when faced with severe illumination degradation in visible images, the\nfusion results of existing image fusion methods often exhibit blurry and dim\nvisual effects, posing major challenges for autonomous driving. To this end, a\nDarkness-Free network is proposed to handle Visible and infrared image\ndisentanglement and fusion all at Once (DFVO), which employs a cascaded\nmulti-task approach to replace the traditional two-stage cascaded training\n(enhancement and fusion), addressing the issue of information entropy loss\ncaused by hierarchical data transmission. Specifically, we construct a\nlatent-common feature extractor (LCFE) to obtain latent features for the\ncascaded tasks strategy. Firstly, a details-extraction module (DEM) is devised\nto acquire high-frequency semantic information. Secondly, we design a hyper\ncross-attention module (HCAM) to extract low-frequency information and preserve\ntexture features from source images. Finally, a relevant loss function is\ndesigned to guide the holistic network learning, thereby achieving better image\nfusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations. Particularly, DFVO can generate clearer, more\ninformative, and more evenly illuminated fusion results in the dark\nenvironments, achieving best performance on the LLVIP dataset with 63.258 dB\nPSNR and 0.724 CC, providing more effective information for high-level vision\ntasks.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the first experimental evaluation of four previously\nuntested modifications of Unbounded Best-First Minimax algorithm. This\nalgorithm explores the game tree by iteratively expanding the most promising\nsequences of actions based on the current partial game tree. We first evaluate\nthe use of transposition tables, which convert the game tree into a directed\nacyclic graph by merging duplicate states. Second, we compare the original\nalgorithm by Korf & Chickering with the variant proposed by Cohen-Solal, which\ndiffers in its backpropagation strategy: instead of stopping when a stable\nvalue is encountered, it updates values up to the root. This change slightly\nimproves performance when value ties or transposition tables are involved.\nThird, we assess replacing the exact terminal evaluation function with the\nlearned heuristic function. While beneficial when exact evaluations are costly,\nthis modification reduces performance in inexpensive settings. Finally, we\nexamine the impact of the completion technique that prioritizes resolved\nwinning states and avoids resolved losing states. This technique also improves\nperformance. Overall, our findings highlight how targeted modifications can\nenhance the efficiency of Unbounded Best-First Minimax.",

    "abstract": "Cost-effective machine vision systems dedicated to real-time and accurate\nface detection and recognition in public places are crucial for many modern\napplications. However, despite their high performance, which could be reached\nusing specialized edge or cloud AI hardware accelerators, there is still room\nfor improvement in throughput and power consumption. This paper aims to suggest\na combined hardware-software approach that optimizes face detection and\nrecognition systems on one of the latest edge GPUs, namely NVIDIA Jetson AGX\nOrin. First, it leverages the simultaneous usage of all its hardware engines to\nimprove processing time. This offers an improvement over previous works where\nthese tasks were mainly allocated automatically and exclusively to the CPU or,\nto a higher extent, to the GPU core. Additionally, the paper suggests\nintegrating a face tracker module to avoid redundantly running the face\nrecognition algorithm for every frame but only when a new face appears in the\nscene. The results of extended experiments suggest that simultaneous usage of\nall the hardware engines that are available in the Orin GPU and tracker\nintegration into the pipeline yield an impressive throughput of 290 FPS (frames\nper second) on 1920 x 1080 input size frames containing in average of 6\nfaces/frame. Additionally, a substantial saving of power consumption of around\n800 mW was achieved when compared to running the task on the CPU/GPU engines\nonly and without integrating a tracker into the Orin GPU\\'92s pipeline. This\nhardware-codesign approach can pave the way to design high-performance machine\nvision systems at the edge, critically needed in video monitoring in public\nplaces where several nearby cameras are usually deployed for a same scene.",

The nature of many ULXs is still\nunclear, as are the detailed properties of accretion in PULXs. Aims. We seek an\nanswer to questions such as: Is there a QPO model that fits the data? Can mHz\nQPOs be used to constrain the magnetic field and accretion rate of the neutron\nstars in PULXs? Are all the low frequency QPOs in ULXs a manifestation of the\nsame phenomenon? Methods. We apply Dong Lai's precession model to the PULX\ndata, with the magnetic threading of the accretion disk constrained by recent\nsimulations. Results. Based on the magnetic precession model, and on recent\nprogress in understanding the inner structure of accretion disks, we predict an\ninverse scaling of QPO frequency with the neutron star period in PULXs. The\ntheoretical curve is largely independent of the stellar magnetic field or mass\naccretion rate and agrees with the data for the known QPOs in PULXs.

In optimization theory, a\nsemi-definite program (SDP) involves a linear objective function optimized over\nthe cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space.\nThese problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization\ncommunities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are\nessentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by\nquantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the\naforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant\nsolution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is\nconcave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard\n(stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these\nparameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low\ntemperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for\nthe minimum energy. We then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent\napproach can be used in both first- and second-order classical and hybrid\nquantum-classical algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it\ncan be used for solving SDPs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the\nalgorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum\nthermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why\nalgorithms published fifty years after Jaynes' seminal work, including the\nmatrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient\nupdate method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at\nsolving SDPs.",

To enable audio- and video-conditioned\ngeneration, we further propose modality-specific condition injection\nmechanisms: an AudioNet module that achieves hierarchical alignment via spatial\ncross-attention, and a video-driven injection module that integrates\nlatent-compressed conditional video through a patchify-based feature-alignment\nnetwork. Extensive experiments on single- and multi-subject scenarios\ndemonstrate that HunyuanCustom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-\nand closed-source methods in terms of ID consistency, realism, and text-video\nalignment. Moreover, we validate its robustness across downstream tasks,\nincluding audio and video-driven customized video generation. Our results\nhighlight the effectiveness of multi-modal conditioning and identity-preserving\nstrategies in advancing controllable video generation.

    "abstract": "One of the main theories for heating of the solar corona is based on the idea\nthat solar convection shuffles and tangles magnetic field lines to make many\nsmall-scale current sheets that, via reconnection, heat coronal loops. Tiwari\net al 2017 present evidence that, besides depending on loop length and other\nfactors, the brightness of a coronal loop depends on the field strength in the\nloop feet and the freedom of convection in the feet. While it is known that\nstrong solar magnetic fields suppress convection, the decrease in the speed of\nhorizontal advection of magnetic flux with increasing field strength has not\nbeen quantified before. We quantify that trend by analyzing 24hours of HMI\nSHARP vector magnetograms of each of six sunspot active regions and their\nsurroundings. Using Fourier Local Correlation Tracking, we estimate the\nhorizontal advection speed of the magnetic flux at each pixel in which the\nvertical component of the magnetic field strength (Bz) is well above (greater\nthan or equal to 150 G) noise level. We find that the average horizontal\nadvection speed of magnetic flux steadily decreases as Bz increases, from 110\npm 3 meters per sec for 150 G (in network and plage) to 10 pm 4 meters per sec\nfor 2500 G (in sunspot umbra). The trend is well fit by a fourth degree\npolynomial. These results quantitatively confirm the expectation that magnetic\nflux advection is suppressed by increasing magnetic field strength. The\npresented quantitative relation should be useful for future MHD simulations of\ncoronal heating.",

Both the total and polarized lightcurves show variability in\ncorrespondence with a rotation period of 1.95+/-0.03 hr.

    "abstract": "Dynamical friction is an important phenomena in stellar dynamics resulting in\nthe slowing down of a test particle upon many two-body scatters with background\nparticles. Chandrasekhar's original formulation, developed for idealized\ninfinite and homogeneous systems, has been found to be sufficiently accurate\neven in models of finite extent and radially dependent density profiles.\nHowever, in some cases $N-$body simulations evidenced a breakdown of\nChandrasekhar's formalism. In particular, in the case of cored stellar systems,\nthe analytical predictions underestimate the rate of in-fall of the test\nparticle. Several explanations for such discrepancy have been proposed so far,\nin spite of this it remains unclear whether the origin is a finite N effect or\nan effect arising from the resonance of the orbits of the test and field\nparticles, which is independent on $N$, such as dynamical buoyancy. Here we aim\nat shedding some light on this issue with tailored numerical experiments. We\nperform ad hoc simulations of a massive tracer initially placed on a low\neccentricity orbit in spherical equilibrium models with increasing resolution.\nWe use an $N-$body code where the self-consistent interaction among the\nbackground particles can be substituted with the effect of the static smooth\npotential of the system's continuum limit, so that the higher order\ncontributions to the dynamical friction arising from the formation of a wake\ncan be neglected if needed. We find that, contrary to what reported in the\nprevious literature, a suppression of dynamical friction happens in both cuspy\nand cored models. When neglecting the interaction among field particles we\nobserve in both cases a clear $N^{-1/2}$ scaling of the radius at which\ndynamical friction ceases to be effective. This hints towards a\ngranularity-induced origin of the so-called core-stalling of the massive tracer\nin cored models.",

This paper aims to maximize the simultaneous usage of\nhardware engines available in edge GPUs nowadays by leveraging the concurrency\nand pipelining of tasks required for face detection and recognition. This also\nincludes the video decoding task, which is required in most face monitoring\napplications as the video streams are usually carried via Gbps Ethernet\nnetwork. This constitutes an improvement over previous works where the tasks\nare usually allocated to a single engine due to the lack of a unified and\nautomated framework that simultaneously explores all hardware engines. In\naddition, previously, the input faces were usually embedded in still images or\nwithin raw video streams that overlook the burst delay caused by the decoding\nstage. The results on real-life video streams suggest that simultaneously using\nall the hardware engines available in the recent NVIDIA edge Orin GPU, higher\nthroughput, and a slight saving of power consumption of around 300 mW,\naccounting for around 5%, have been achieved while satisfying the real-time\nperformance constraint. The performance gets even higher by considering several\nvideo streams simultaneously.

    "abstract": "Accurate state estimation is essential for effective control of robots. For\nsoft robots, this task is particularly challenging because their states are\ninherently infinite-dimensional functions due to the robots' continuous\ndeformability. Traditional sensing techniques, however, can only provide\ndiscrete measurements. Recently, a dynamic state estimation method known as a\nboundary observer was introduced, which leverages Cosserat rod theory to\nrecover all infinite-dimensional states by measuring only the velocity twist at\nthe robot's tip. In this work, we present a novel boundary observer that can\nalso recover infinite-dimensional dynamic states, but instead relies on\nmeasuring the internal wrench at the robot's base. This design exploits the\nduality between the velocity twist at the tip and the internal wrench at the\nbase, with both types of boundary observers being inspired by principles of\nenergy dissipation. Despite the mathematical duality, the proposed approach\noffers a distinct advantage: it requires only a 6-axis force/torque sensor\nembedded at the base, eliminating the need for external sensing systems such as\nmotion capture cameras. Moreover, combining both tip- and base-based techniques\nenhances energy dissipation, accelerates convergence, and improves estimation\naccuracy. We validate the proposed algorithms through both simulation studies\nand experiments based on tendon-driven continuum robots. Our results\ndemonstrate that all boundary observers converge to the ground truth within 3\nseconds, even with significantly deviated initial conditions. Furthermore, they\nrecover from unknown perturbations and effectively track high-frequency\nvibrations. We also show that combining the dual techniques further improves\nconvergence speed and accuracy. Finally, the computational efficiency of these\nalgorithms indicates their feasibility for real-time state estimation.",

    "abstract": "Associative polymers (APs) with reversible, specific interactions between\n``sticker'' sites exhibit a phase behavior that depends on a delicate balance\nbetween distinct contributions controlling the binding. For highly-bonded\nsystems, it is entropy that mostly determines if, on increasing concentration,\nthe network forms progressively or \\textit{via} a first-order transition. With\nthe aim of introducing an experimentally-viable system tailored to test the\nsubtle dependence of the phase behavior on the binding site topology, here we\nnumerically investigate AP polymers made of DNA, where ``sticker'' sites made\nby short DNA sequences are interspersed in a flexible backbone of poly-T\nspacers. Due to their self-complementarity, each binding sequence can associate\nwith another identical sticky sequence. We compare two architectures: one with\na single sticker type, $(AA)_6$, and one with two distinct alternating types,\n$(AB)_6$. At low temperature, when most of the stickers are involved in a bond,\nthe $(AA)_6$ system remains homogeneous, while the $(AB)_6$ system exhibits\nphase separation, driven primarily by entropic factors, mirroring predictions\nfrom simpler bead-spring models. Analysis of bond distributions and polymer\nconformations confirms that the predominantly entropic driving force behind\nthis separation arises from the different topological constraints associated\nwith intra- versus inter-molecular bonding. Our results establish DNA APs as a\ncontrollable, realistic platform for studying in the laboratory how the\nthermodynamics of associative polymer networks depends on the bonding site\narchitecture in a clean and controlled way.",

Despite the formidable generative capacities of LLMs,\nthis task remains challenging, as these models neither encounter parametric\nsequences during their pretraining phase nor possess direct awareness of 3D\nstructures. To address this, we present CAD-Llama, a framework designed to\nenhance pretrained LLMs for generating parametric 3D CAD models. Specifically,\nwe develop a hierarchical annotation pipeline and a code-like format to\ntranslate parametric 3D CAD command sequences into Structured Parametric CAD\nCode (SPCC), incorporating hierarchical semantic descriptions. Furthermore, we\npropose an adaptive pretraining approach utilizing SPCC, followed by an\ninstruction tuning process aligned with CAD-specific guidelines.

However, in 3D,\nadditional reconnection geometries are possible, in particular the AR-RF, where\nexternal reconnection involving the overlying arcades (A) and erupting flux\nrope (R) turns into another arcade and a flare loop (F). This process results\nin the drifting of the legs of the erupting flux rope. We investigated\nspectroscopic signatures of such AR-RF reconnection occurring in an erupting\nfilament reconnecting with coronal arcades during a two-ribbon flare. The\nevolution of the erupting filament eruption is examined using observations by\nthe Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Interface Region Imaging\nSpectrograph (IRIS). As the filament rises into the corona, it reconnects with\nthe surrounding arcade of coronal loops with localized brightenings, resulting\nin the disappearance of the coronal loops and formation of a hot flux rope,\nshowing slipping motion of its footpoints extending to the previous footpoints\nof the coronal loops (AR-RF reconnection) as predicted by the 3D extensions to\nthe Standard solar flare model. These brightenings are accompanied by the\npresence of strong blue-shifts in both the IRIS Si IV and Mg II lines, upto\nabout 200 km/s. The lines are also extremely wide, with non-thermal widths\nabove 100 km/s. Furthermore, a strongly non-Gaussian profile of the most\nblue-shifted component is detected at the start of the AR-RF reconnection,\nindicating the presence of accelerated particles and MHD turbulence, and\nassociated with the appearance of hot plasma in the AIA 94 A passband. For the\nfirst time, an observation has been reported in which the IRIS slit\nsuccessfully captures AR-RF reconnection between a filament and overlying\narcades, resulting in strong blue-shifts and very broad line profiles.",

Arguments exist based on\nthe RGE running of the $U(1)_D$ gauge coupling suggesting that at higher scales\n$U(1)_D$ becomes part of a more complex non-Abelian group, a simple example\nbeing just the SM-like $G_D=SU(2)_I \\times U(1)_{Y_I}$. In our past analyses it\nwas always assumed that $G_D$ broke in a SM-like manner directly to the DP's\n$U(1)_D$ which then subsequently broke at low energies $\\lsim 1$ GeV. However,\nthis need not be the case and $G_D$ can instead break to $U(1)_{T_{3I}}\\times\nU(1)_{Y_I}$, with $T_{3I}$ being the diagonal generator of $SU(2)_I$, now\nproducing two light gauge bosons which obtain masses at the $\\lsim 1$ GeV\nscale. In this paper we will explore the phenomenology of a very simple\nrealization of this kind of alternative setup employing non-abelian KM and\nhaving a minimal, lepton-like PM sector, demonstrating its distinctive nature\nin comparison to the previously examined symmetry breaking path. The effects of\ninterference between these gauge bosons on thermal dark matter annihilation,\nthe production of new heavy gauge, Higgs and PM states at colliders, as well as\nthe corresponding signatures for the light dark gauge bosons are examined.",

    "abstract": "Many conservative physical systems can be described using the Hamiltonian\nformalism. A notable example is the Vlasov-Poisson equations, a set of partial\ndifferential equations that govern the time evolution of a phase-space density\nfunction representing collisionless particles under a self-consistent\npotential. These equations play a central role in both plasma physics and\ncosmology. Due to the complexity of the potential involved, analytical\nsolutions are rarely available, necessitating the use of numerical methods such\nas Particle-In-Cell. In this work, we introduce a novel approach based on\nHamiltonian-informed Normalizing Flows, specifically a variant of Fixed-Kinetic\nNeural Hamiltonian Flows. Our method transforms an initial Gaussian\ndistribution in phase space into the final distribution using a sequence of\ninvertible, volume-preserving transformations derived from Hamiltonian\ndynamics. The model is trained on a dataset comprising initial and final states\nat a fixed time T, generated via numerical simulations. After training, the\nmodel enables fast sampling of the final distribution from any given initial\nstate. Moreover, by automatically learning an interpretable physical potential,\nit can generalize to intermediate states not seen during training, offering\ninsights into the system's evolution across time.",

Traditional HTTPS-based methods, although widely used, face\nlimitations in computational efficiency and scalability when securing these\nhigh-resolution streams. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel\nframework integrating Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) with selective\nencryption techniques tailored specifically for tiled 360{\\deg} video\nstreaming. Our approach employs selective encryption of frames at varying\nlevels to reduce computational overhead while ensuring robust protection\nagainst unauthorized access.\n  Moreover, we explore viewport-adaptive encryption, dynamically encrypting\nmore frames within tiles occupying larger portions of the viewer's field of\nview. This targeted method significantly enhances security in critical viewing\nareas without unnecessary overhead in peripheral regions. We deploy and\nevaluate our proposed approach using the CloudLab testbed, comparing its\nperformance against traditional HTTPS streaming. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our ABE-based model achieves reduced computational load on\nintermediate caches, improves cache hit rates, and maintains comparable visual\nquality to HTTPS, as assessed by Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF).",

Due to\nthis design, current existing metrics rarely handle multiple clustering models\nwith diverse cluster definitions, nor do they comply with the integration of\nconstraints when available. In this work, we take inspiration from consensus\nclustering and assume that a set of clustering models is able to uncover hidden\nstructures in the data. We propose to construct a discriminative ordering\nthrough ensemble clustering based on the distance between the connectivity of a\nclustering model and the consensus matrix.

Furthermore, we introduce two filtering methods:\none relies on measuring error strength, while the other utilizes statistical\nfiltering to improve the extrapolation process. Comparing our approach with\nstandard ZNE reveals that adaptive scaling factors can be optimized using\neither a noise model or direct error strength measurements from inverted\ncircuits. The integration of adaptive scaling with filtering techniques leads\nto notable improvements in expectation-value extrapolation over standard ZNE.\nOur findings demonstrate that these adaptive methods effectively strengthen\nerror mitigation against noise fluctuations, thereby enhancing the precision\nand reliability of quantum computations.",

TIGRL aims to embed nodes in TIGs into\nlow-dimensional representations that effectively preserve both structural and\ntemporal information, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks\nsuch as classification, prediction, and clustering within constantly evolving\ndata environments. In this paper, we begin by introducing the foundational\nconcepts of TIGs and emphasize the critical role of temporal dependencies. We\nthen propose a comprehensive taxonomy of state-of-the-art TIGRL methods,\nsystematically categorizing them based on the types of information utilized\nduring the learning process to address the unique challenges inherent to TIGs.\nTo facilitate further research and practical applications, we curate the source\nof datasets and benchmarks, providing valuable resources for empirical\ninvestigations.

This is primarily due to an overreliance on forgery artifacts and a\nlimited understanding of real faces. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel approach RealID to enhance generalization by learning a comprehensive\nconcept of real faces while assessing the probabilities of belonging to the\nreal and fake classes independently. RealID comprises two key modules: the Real\nConcept Capture Module (RealC2) and the Independent Dual-Decision Classifier\n(IDC). With the assistance of a MultiReal Memory, RealC2 maintains various\nprototypes for real faces, allowing the model to capture a comprehensive\nconcept of real class. Meanwhile, IDC redefines the classification strategy by\nmaking independent decisions based on the concept of the real class and the\npresence of forgery artifacts. Through the combined effect of the above\nmodules, the influence of forgery-irrelevant patterns is alleviated, and\nextensive experiments on five widely used datasets demonstrate that RealID\nsignificantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 1.74%\nimprovement in average accuracy.",

Recently, van der Waals magnetic materials have emerged and shown\npotential in spintronic devices at atomic scale. Owing to their tunable\nphysical properties and the flexibility in fabrication, the van der Waals\nheterostructures offer more possibilities for investigating potential\nmechanisms of the exchange bias effect. However, due to low magnetic ordering\ntemperatures for most van der Waals magnets, to establish exchange bias in van\nder Waals antiferromagnet/ferromagnet heterostructures at room temperature is\nchallenging. In this study, we fabricate\n(Fe$_{0.56}$Co$_{0.44}$)$_{5}$GeTe$_{2}$(FCGT)/Fe$_{3}$GaTe$_{2}$(FGaT)\nheterostructures with magnetic ordering temperatures of each component well\nabove room temperature to achieve a room temperature exchange bias effect. It\nis found that the sign and magnitude of the exchange bias field can be\nefficiently controlled by manipulating the N\\'eel order of FCGT with magnetic\nfield. The manipulation of N\\'eel order shows significant magnetic field\ndependence. A strong pre-set field induces a switch in the N\\'eel order of\nFCGT, which aligns the interfacial magnetization at the FCGT/FGaT interface,\nleading to robust exchange bias, as revealed by both transport measurements and\nmacro-spin model calculations. Our findings demonstrate the intrinsic\nmanipulation and switchable of room-temperature exchange bias in all-van der\nWaals heterostructures and further promote the development of novel\ntwo-dimensional spintronic devices.",

Upon thermal annealing of GO, the resulting reduced graphene oxide\n(rGO) films exhibit spatially varying coverage, leading to three distinct GaN\nnucleation outcomes: (i) ELOG-like nucleation on exposed substrate regions,\n(ii) thru-hole epitaxy (THE)-like nucleation through appropriately thin areas,\nand (iii) complete nucleation suppression on thickly stacked zones. On\nspin-coated GO films without TBA, all three behaviors coexist, and undesired\nELOG- and no-nucleation modes persist due to uneven coverage. Importantly,\nthese issues cannot be resolved by simply adjusting GO flake concentration, as\nconcentration tuning alone fails to eliminate the formation of locally bare and\noverly thick regions. In contrast, the addition of TBA results in a more\nuniform, moderately stacked rGO morphology that suppresses both ELOG- and\nno-nucleation modes while expanding THE-like nucleation regions. This reshaped\nnucleation landscape confines GaN growth to areas with engineered percolative\ntransport. The approach offers a scalable, lithography-free route for\ncontrolling GaN epitaxy using solution-processable 2D material masks.",

However, IRS\nperformance relies on accurately configuring the phase shifts of reflecting\nelements, which introduces substantial phase shift information (PSI) delivery\noverhead, especially in large-scale or rapidly changing environments. This\npaper first introduces the architecture of IRS-assisted systems and highlights\nreal-world use cases where PSI delivery becomes a critical bottleneck. It then\nreviews current PSI compression approaches, outlining their limitations in\nadaptability and scalability. To address these gaps, we propose a prompt-guided\nPSI compression framework that leverages task-aware prompts and meta-learning\nto achieve efficient and real-time PSI delivery under diverse conditions.\nSimulation results show improved reconstruction accuracy and robustness\ncompared to the baseline method.

These have\nbeen extensively studied for tailoring light propagation. Most studies use an\neffective medium approach that is extremely useful, though it misses out on\nproperties that can arise from the microscopic details of the HMM. In\nparticular, the HMM can have cavity-like modes, and it is important to\nunderstand such modes and their relevance in light propagation and coupling of\nHMM to quantum emitters. In this work, we bring out the cavity-like modes of\nthe silver nanowire-alumina two-dimensional HMM, which remain on top of the\nbroad response of the HMM. These modes define the characteristic reflection\nspectra. The observed resonances and their widths are in good agreement with\nour simulations. These well-defined modes occur even though the metallic part\nof the HMM has Ohmic losses. Then, we present experimental results on the\ncoupling of quantum emitters to the cavity-like modes of the HMM. We present\nresults for both steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence. Using these,\nwe extract the corresponding Purcell factors for radiative rate enhancement.\nTheoretical analyses of the experimental data allow the determination of the\ncavity coupling parameters and mode volumes. These experimental results are\nconfirmed by the FDTD calculations for the HMM mode volume.

    "abstract": "Assessing consistency in Pairwise Comparison Matrices (PCMs) within the\nAnalytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) poses significant challenges when using the\ntraditional Consistency Ratio (CR) method. This study introduces a novel\nalternative that leverages triadic preference reversals (PR) to provide a more\nrobust and interpretable assessment of consistency. Triadic preference\nreversals capture inconsistencies between a pair of elements by comparing the\ndirection of preference derived from the global eigenvector with that from a\n3x3 submatrix (triad) containing the same pair, highlighting local-global\npreference conflicts. This method detects a reversal when one eigen ratio\nexceeds one while another falls below one, signaling inconsistency. We identify\ntwo key features: the proportion of preference reversals and the maximum\nreversal, which mediate the impact of a PCM's order on its consistency. Using\nthese features simulated PCMs are clustered into consistent and inconsistent\nclasses through k-means clustering, followed by training a logistic classifier\nfor consistency evaluation. The PR method achieves 97\\% accuracy, significantly\nsurpassing the Consistency Ratio (CR) method's 50%, with a false negative rate\nof only 2.6\\% compared to 5.5\\%. These findings demonstrate the PR method's\nsuperior accuracy in assessing AHP consistency, thereby enabling more reliable\ndecision-making.

In the present work, we embed\nsuch models, originally studied in the cold inflation picture, in the context\nof warm inflation. We study the viability of different fibre inflation\npotentials in both strong and weak dissipative regime of warm inflation. In\nfibre inflation, the inflaton is a four-dimensional complex manifold -- a fibre\nof a $K3$ fibred Calabi-Yau. The potential in this case is generated by an\ninterplay of various perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. The former\ntype of corrections consists of leading-order $\\alpha'^3-$ term, higher\nderivative $F^4-$ correction, and various string loop corrections of KK,\nlog-loop and winding type. Depending on the balance between several\ncorrections, we present four different fibre inflationary potentials and show\nthat the warm inflationary pictures for all of them can successfully fall in\nthe viable window from both Planck and recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)\ndata. We show that warm inflation makes it possible to extend the range of\nparameters of applicability of these models.

Previous studies, relying on empirical methods\nand the lack of systematic structure-searching tools, suggested a\ndefect-wurtzite (DW-Si3N4) structure for Si3N4 on AlGaN. However, this\nstructure, while plausible, is energetically much higher compared to\nbeta-Si3N4. In a recent experiment (Appl. Phys.

This finding\nprompted a reexamination of its atomic configuration, given the discrepancies\nbetween the previously proposed defect-wurtzite (DW) phase and experimental\nobservations. To address this, we employed a systematic structure search to\nidentify a more stable configuration, which we denote as Lam-Si3N4. This\nstructure, characterized by a quasi-two-dimensional (Lamina) structure, is\napproximately 60 meV/atom lower in energy than the DW-Si3N4 structure under the\nin-plane lattice constant constraint matching AlGaN, and provides a better\nmatch to experimental data. Furthermore, when fully relaxed (i.e., no external\nstrain), both DW-Si3N4 and Lam-Si3N4 exhibit wide band gaps around 4~eV.\nHowever, under the imposed AlGaN lattice constant constraint, the band gap of\nDW-Si3N4 significantly shrinks, whereas Lam-Si3N4 retains a relatively larger\ngap. The mechanical and phonon anisotropy in Lam-Si3N4 may lead to distinct\ndirectional thermal conductivity and elastic behavior, which can be beneficial\nfor high-frequency and high-power applications. These findings provide\nimportant insights into the structure and properties of in situ grown Si3N4,\npotentially guiding further optimization of cap layers for GaN-based devices.",

Existing approaches generally\nenhance vigilance parameter robustness through adaptive mechanisms such as\nparticle swarm optimization and fuzzy logic rules. However, they often\nintroduce additional hyperparameters or complex frameworks that contradict the\noriginal simplicity of the algorithm. To address this, we propose Iterative\nRefinement Adaptive Resonance Theory (IR-ART), which integrates three key\nphases into a unified iterative framework: (1) Cluster Stability Detection: A\ndynamic stability detection module that identifies unstable clusters by\nanalyzing the change of sample size (number of samples in the cluster) in\niteration.

Experimental evaluation on 15 datasets\ndemonstrates that IR-ART improves tolerance to suboptimal vigilance parameter\nvalues while preserving the parameter simplicity of Fuzzy ART.

At the cost of ever-increasing computational load and\nsensor complexity, odometry algorithms have reached impressive levels of\naccuracy with minimal drift in various conditions. In this paper, we question\nthe need for more research on odometry for autonomous driving by assessing the\naccuracy of one of the simplest algorithms: the direct integration of wheel\nencoder data and yaw rate measurements from a gyroscope. We denote this\nalgorithm as Odometer-Gyroscope (OG) odometry.

For example, the OG\nodometry is on top of the Boreas leaderboard with a relative translation error\nof 0.20%, while the second-best method displays an error of 0.26%.\nLidar-inertial approaches can provide more accurate estimates, but the\ncomputational load is three orders of magnitude higher than the OG odometry.

    "abstract": "Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) is used to study the surface magnetic field\ntopology of stars, based on high-resolution spectropolarimetric time series\nobservations. Multiple ZDI inversions have been conducted for the early B-type\nstar tau Sco, which has been found to exhibit a weak but complex non-dipolar\nsurface magnetic field. The classical ZDI framework suffers from a significant\nlimitation in that it provides little to no reliable uncertainty quantification\nfor the reconstructed magnetic field maps, with essentially all published\nresults being confined to point estimates. To fill this gap, we propose a\nBayesian framework for probabilistic ZDI. Here, the proposed framework is\ndemonstrated on tau Sco in the weak-field limit. We propose three distinct\nstatistical models, and use archival ESPaDOnS high-resolution Stokes V\nobservations to carry out the probabilistic magnetic inversion in closed form.\nThe surface magnetic field is parameterised by a high-dimensional\nspherical-harmonic expansion. By comparing three different prior distributions\nover the latent variables in the spherical-harmonic decomposition, our results\nshowcase the ZDI sensitivity to various hyperparameters. The mean magnetic\nfield maps are qualitatively similar to previously published point estimates,\nbut analysis of the magnetic energy distribution indicates high uncertainty and\nhigher energy content at low angular degrees l. Our results effectively\ndemonstrate that, for stars in the weak-field regime, reliable uncertainty\nquantification of recovered magnetic field maps can be obtained in closed form\nwith natural assumptions on the statistical model. Future work will explore\nextending this framework beyond the weak-field approximation and incorporating\nprior uncertainty over multiple stellar parameters in more complex magnetic\ninversion problems.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed Machine Learning (ML) setup, where a\nshared model is collaboratively trained by various clients using their local\ndatasets while keeping the data private. Considering resource-constrained\ndevices, FL clients often suffer from restricted transmission capacity. Aiming\nto enhance the system performance, the communication between clients and server\nneeds to be diminished. Current FL strategies transmit a tremendous amount of\ndata (model weights) within the FL process, which needs a high communication\nbandwidth. Considering resource constraints, increasing the number of clients\nand, consequently, the amount of data (model weights) can lead to a bottleneck.\nIn this paper, we introduce the Federated Black Widow Optimization (FedBWO)\ntechnique to decrease the amount of transmitted data by transmitting only a\nperformance score rather than the local model weights from clients. FedBWO\nemploys the BWO algorithm to improve local model updates. The conducted\nexperiments prove that FedBWO remarkably improves the performance of the global\nmodel and the communication efficiency of the overall system. According to the\nexperimental outcomes, FedBWO enhances the global model accuracy by an average\nof 21% over FedAvg, and 12% over FedGWO.

Furthermore, non-detection below 500 MHz may indicate a\nlow-frequency turnover in the source's spectrum, while no secular decline in\nthe flux density of the source over time, as was apparent from previous\nobservations, has been observed. Using high time-resolution MeerKAT data, we\ndemonstrate two distinct quasi-periodic oscillation modes present in single\npulses, with characteristic time scales of 73 ms and 21 ms.

Finally, we show that the W$_{50}$\npulse width is nearly constant from 544-4032 MHz, consistent with zero\nradius-to-frequency mapping. The very short duty cycle ($\\sim$1.4$^{\\circ}$) is\nmore similar to radio pulsars with periods $>$5 seconds than to radio-loud\nmagnetars.

    "abstract": "We study a game-theoretic model for pool formation in Proof of Stake\nblockchain protocols. In such systems, stakeholders can form pools as a means\nof obtaining regular rewards from participation in ledger maintenance, with the\npower of each pool being dependent on its collective stake. The question we are\ninterested in is the design of mechanisms that suitably split rewards among\npool members and achieve favorable properties in the resulting pool\nconfiguration. With this in mind, we initiate a non-cooperative game-theoretic\nanalysis of the well known Shapley value scheme from cooperative game theory\ninto the context of blockchains. In particular, we focus on the oceanic model\nof games, proposed by Milnor and Shapley (1978), which is suitable for\npopulations where a small set of large players coexists with a big mass of\nrather small, negligible players. This provides an appropriate level of\nabstraction for pool formation processes among the stakeholders. We provide\ncomparisons between the Shapley mechanism and the more standard proportional\nscheme, in terms of attained decentralization, via a Price of Stability\nanalysis and in terms of susceptibility to Sybil attacks, i.e., the strategic\nsplitting of a players' stake with the intention of participating in multiple\npools for increased profit. Interestingly, while the widely deployed\nproportional scheme appears to have certain advantages, the Shapley value\nscheme, which rewards higher the most pivotal players, emerges as a competitive\nalternative, by being able to bypass some of the downsides of proportional\nsharing, while also not being far from optimal guarantees w.r.t.\ndecentralization. Finally, we complement our study with some variations of\nproportional sharing, where the profit is split in proportion to a\nsuperadditive or a subadditive function of the stake, showing that the Shapley\nvalue scheme still maintains the same advantages.",

However, many of its atmospheric constraints remain debatable.\nWhile HST observations suggested a highly sub-solar metallicity, recent JWST\nNIRCam observations by Xue et al. 2024 constrained a super-solar metallicity\nwith highly sub-solar C/O. In this work, we show a detailed investigation of HD\n209458 b transmission spectra observations from JWST and HST using SANSAR, a\nnewly developed planetary atmosphere modeling framework, with free, equilibrium\nchemistry and self-consistent grid retrievals. The overall best-fitting model\nwith free retrievals ($\\chi^2_{\\rm{red}}$=1.21) constrains its metallicity and\nC/O to be highly sub-solar, while equilibrium chemistry and grid retrievals\n($\\chi^2_{\\rm{red}}$=1.27 and 1.30, respectively) are consistent with solar\nvalues using STIS+WFC3+NIRCam observations. The retrieved abundances of H$_2$O\nand CO$_2$ are almost three orders of magnitude lower (highly sub-solar) with\nSTIS+WFC3+NIRCam compared to just NIRCam, using free retrievals. NIRCam\nobservations alone also result in misleading constraints on metallicity and\nC/O, with equilibrium chemistry and grid retrieval. We find that the model\nchoice of varying C/H or O/H to vary the C/O in equilibrium chemistry\nretrievals leads to different metallicity constraints with NIRCam, but similar\nconstraints with STIS+WFC3+NIRCam. We conclude that NIRCam observations alone\ncan lead to overestimation of abundances for exoplanet atmospheres and,\ntherefore, should be used in combination with UV/Optical and near-infrared\nobservations to obtain robust constraints on abundances, C/O, and metallicity.\nSpecifically, even though we can detect the CO$_2$ feature with just NIRCam, we\ncannot constrain its abundances robustly without the optical baseline.",

In this simple model the essential\ntransport occurs via inelastic resonant interactions of waves on a lattice. The\nprocess is shown to result universally in a subdiffusive spreading of the wave\nfield. The dispersion of this spreading process is found to depend exclusively\non the type of the interaction process (three- or four-wave), but not on a\nparticular instability behind. The asymptotic transport equations for field\nspreading are derived with the aid of a specific geometric construction in the\nform of a comb. The results can be summarized by stating that the asymptotic\nspreading pursues as a continuous-time random walk (CTRW) and corresponds to a\nkinetic description in terms of fractional-derivative equations. The fractional\nindexes pertaining to these equations are obtained exactly using the comb\nmodel. A special case of the above theory is a situation when two waves with\noppositely directed wave vectors couple together to form a bound state with\nzero momentum. This situation is considered separately and associated with the\nself-organization of wave-like turbulence into banded flows or staircases.\nOverall, we find that turbulence spreading and staircasing could be described\nbased on the same mathematical formalism, using the Hamiltonian of inelastic\nwave-wave interactions and a mapping procedure into the comb space.\nTheoretically, the comb approach is regarded as a substitute for a more common\ndescription based on quasilinear theory.

At the same time, in real-world software projects,\nrepositories can span up to millions of LoC. This paper closes this gap by\ncontributing to the long context code generation benchmark (YABLoCo). The\nbenchmark featured a test set of 215 functions selected from four large\nrepositories with thousands of functions. The dataset contained metadata of\nfunctions, contexts of the functions with different levels of dependencies,\ndocstrings, functions bodies, and call graphs for each repository. This paper\npresents three key aspects of the contribution. First, the benchmark aims at\nfunction body generation in large repositories in C and C++, two languages not\ncovered by previous benchmarks. Second, the benchmark contains large\nrepositories from 200K to 2,000K LoC. Third, we contribute a scalable\nevaluation pipeline for efficient computing of the target metrics and a tool\nfor visual analysis of generated code. Overall, these three aspects allow for\nevaluating code generation in large repositories in C and C++.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has demonstrated transformative potential for database\noperations, such as query optimization and in-database data analytics. However,\ndynamic database environments, characterized by frequent updates and evolving\ndata distributions, introduce concept drift, which leads to performance\ndegradation for learned models and limits their practical applicability.\nAddressing this challenge requires efficient frameworks capable of adapting to\nshifting concepts while minimizing the overhead of retraining or fine-tuning.\n  In this paper, we propose FLAIR, an online adaptation framework that\nintroduces a new paradigm called \\textit{in-context adaptation} for learned\ndatabase operations. FLAIR leverages the inherent property of data systems,\ni.e., immediate availability of execution results for predictions, to enable\ndynamic context construction. By formalizing adaptation as $f:(\\mathbf{x} \\,|\n\\,C_t) \\to \\mathbf{y}$, with $C_t$ representing a dynamic context memory, FLAIR\ndelivers predictions aligned with the current concept, eliminating the need for\nruntime parameter optimization. To achieve this, FLAIR integrates two key\nmodules: a Task Featurization Module for encoding task-specific features into\nstandardized representations, and a Dynamic Decision Engine, pre-trained via\nBayesian meta-training, to adapt seamlessly using contextual information at\nruntime. Extensive experiments across key database tasks demonstrate that FLAIR\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 5.2x faster adaptation\nand reducing error by 22.5% for cardinality estimation.",

    "abstract": "Reliable street-level traffic volume data, covering multiple modes of\ntransportation, helps urban planning by informing decisions on infrastructure\nimprovements, traffic management, and public transportation. Yet, traffic\nsensors measuring traffic volume are typically scarcely located, due to their\nhigh deployment and maintenance costs. To address this, interpolation methods\ncan estimate traffic volumes at unobserved locations using available data.\nGraph Neural Networks have shown strong performance in traffic volume\nforecasting, particularly on highways and major arterial networks. Applying\nthem to urban settings, however, presents unique challenges: urban networks\nexhibit greater structural diversity, traffic volumes are highly overdispersed\nwith many zeros, the best way to account for spatial dependencies remains\nunclear, and sensor coverage is often very sparse. We introduce the Graph\nNeural Network for Urban Interpolation (GNNUI), a novel urban traffic volume\nestimation approach. GNNUI employs a masking algorithm to learn interpolation,\nintegrates node features to capture functional roles, and uses a loss function\ntailored to zero-inflated traffic distributions. In addition to the model, we\nintroduce two new open, large-scale urban traffic volume benchmarks, covering\ndifferent transportation modes: Strava cycling data from Berlin and New York\nCity taxi data. GNNUI outperforms recent, some graph-based, interpolation\nmethods across metrics (MAE, RMSE, true-zero rate, Kullback-Leibler divergence)\nand remains robust from 90% to 1% sensor coverage. On Strava, for instance, MAE\nrises only from 7.1 to 10.5, on Taxi from 23.0 to 40.4, demonstrating strong\nperformance under extreme data scarcity, common in real-world urban settings.\nWe also examine how graph connectivity choices influence model accuracy.",

    "abstract": "While foundation models excel in text, image, and video domains, the critical\nbiological signals, particularly electroencephalography(EEG), remain\nunderexplored. EEG benefits neurological research with its high temporal\nresolution, operational practicality, and safety profile. However, low\nsignal-to-noise ratio, inter-subject variability, and cross-paradigm\ndifferences hinder the generalization of current models. Existing methods often\nemploy simplified strategies, such as a single loss function or a\nchannel-temporal joint representation module, and suffer from a domain gap\nbetween pretraining and evaluation tasks that compromises efficiency and\nadaptability. To address these limitations, we propose the Adaptive Large\nFoundation model for EEG signal representation(ALFEE) framework, a novel hybrid\ntransformer architecture with two learning stages for robust EEG representation\nlearning. ALFEE employs a hybrid attention that separates channel-wise feature\naggregation from temporal dynamics modeling, enabling robust EEG representation\nwith variable channel configurations. A channel encoder adaptively compresses\nvariable channel information, a temporal encoder captures task-guided\nevolution, and a hybrid decoder reconstructs signals in both temporal and\nfrequency domains. During pretraining, ALFEE optimizes task prediction, channel\nand temporal mask reconstruction, and temporal forecasting to enhance\nmulti-scale and multi-channel representation. During fine-tuning, a full-model\nadaptation with a task-specific token dictionary and a cross-attention layer\nboosts performance across multiple tasks. After 25,000 hours of pretraining,\nextensive experimental results on six downstream EEG tasks demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of ALFEE over existing models. Our ALFEE framework\nestablishes a scalable foundation for biological signal analysis with\nimplementation at https://github.com/xw1216/ALFEE.",

Previous population studies of hot Jupiter formation have largely\nexamined this mechanism in systems comprised of three bodies: two stars and one\nplanet. However, because stars in a binary system form in similar environments\nwith comparable metallicities, the formation of a single hot Jupiter in such a\nsystem may imply that the conditions are more likely met for the companion\nstar, as well. We investigate the ZLK mechanism with tidal friction as a\npotential mechanism to produce double hot Jupiter systems in stellar binaries.\nUsing N-body simulations, we characterize the evolution of two cold Jupiters,\neach orbiting one star in a binary system, undergoing mirrored ZLK migration.\nWe then examine the robustness of this mechanism to asymmetries in stellar\nmasses, planet masses, and planet orbital inclinations relative to the binary\nplane. We predict that, under the assumptions that (1) most hot Jupiters in\nbinary star systems form through ZLK migration of primordially formed cold\nJupiters and (2) if one star in a binary system forms a cold Jupiter, the\nsecond does as well, a comprehensive search could identify double hot Jupiters\nin up to ~9% of the close- to moderate- separation $a<2000$ AU) binary systems\nthat already host a known hot Jupiter.

While\nmost recent lip reading studies have been based on the ResNet architecture and\nhave achieved significant success, they are not sufficiently suitable for\nefficiently capturing lip reading features due to high computational complexity\nin modeling spatio-temporal information. Additionally, using a complex visual\nmodel not only increases the complexity of lip reading models but also induces\ndelays in the overall network for multi-modal studies (e.g., audio-visual\nspeech recognition, speech enhancement, and speech separation).

The\nmethod operates in low visibility conditions or in dense traffic where the\nanomaly is occluded by a preceding vehicle.

    "abstract": "Purpose: With advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare,\nthe need arises for competitive open-source models to protect the public\ninterest. This work contributes to the field of open medical LLMs by optimizing\nkey stages of data preprocessing and training, while showing how to improve\nmodel safety (through DPO) and efficacy (through RAG). The evaluation\nmethodology used, which includes four different types of tests, defines a new\nstandard for the field. The resultant models, shown to be competitive with the\nbest private alternatives, are released with a permisive license.\n  Methods: Building on top of strong base models like Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5,\nAloe Beta uses a custom dataset to enhance public data with synthetic Chain of\nThought examples. The models undergo alignment with Direct Preference\nOptimization, emphasizing ethical and policy-aligned performance in the\npresence of jailbreaking attacks. Evaluation includes close-ended, open-ended,\nsafety and human assessments, to maximize the reliability of results.\n  Results: Recommendations are made across the entire pipeline, backed by the\nsolid performance of the Aloe Family. These models deliver competitive\nperformance across healthcare benchmarks and medical fields, and are often\npreferred by healthcare professionals. On bias and toxicity, the Aloe Beta\nmodels significantly improve safety, showing resilience to unseen jailbreaking\nattacks. For a responsible release, a detailed risk assessment specific to\nhealthcare is attached to the Aloe Family models.\n  Conclusion: The Aloe Beta models, and the recipe that leads to them, are a\nsignificant contribution to the open-source medical LLM field, offering\ntop-of-the-line performance while maintaining high ethical requirements. This\nwork sets a new standard for developing and reporting aligned LLMs in\nhealthcare.",

We present a novel framework that\nstreamlines this process by providing artists with intuitive control over\ngenerated 3D heads. Our approach uses a geometry-aware texture synthesis\npipeline that learns correlations between head geometry and skin texture maps\nacross different demographics. The framework offers three levels of artistic\ncontrol: manipulation of overall head geometry, adjustment of skin tone while\npreserving facial characteristics, and fine-grained editing of details such as\nwrinkles or facial hair. Our pipeline allows artists to make edits to a single\ntexture map using familiar tools, with our system automatically propagating\nthese changes coherently across the remaining texture maps needed for realistic\nrendering. Experiments demonstrate that our method produces diverse results\nwith clean geometries. We showcase practical applications focusing on intuitive\ncontrol for artists, including skin tone adjustments and simplified editing\nworkflows for adding age-related details or removing unwanted features from\nscanned models.

    "abstract": "Aluminium abundances of B-type stars were spectroscopically determined in\norder to get information about the galactic gas composition at the time of\ntheir formation. For this purpose, two AlII lines at 6243 and 4663A were\nemployed. The non-LTE effect of these AlII lines generally acts in the\ndirection of weakening (i.e., profile becomes shallower) caused by a decrease\nof line opacity (due to overionization) along with an enhanced line source\nfunction (overexcitation), and this effect tends to become progressively larger\nwith an increase in Teff as well as with a decrease in log g (surface gravity).\nRegarding the AlII 6243 line, while the non-LTE calculation qualitatively\nreproduces its overall behavior (e.g., transition from absorption to emission\nat early B-type), some Teff-dependent systematic trend remains unremoved in the\nnon-LTE abundances of normal stars, which means that non-LTE corrections\nevaluated for this line are quantitatively insufficient. Meanwhile, for the\ncase of the Al II 4663 line, which is more advantageous than the 6243 line in\nthe sense that it is stronger without showing any emission, the resulting\nnon-LTE abundances of ordinary B stars are almost constant at the solar\nabundance (A~6.5) over the wide Teff range (~10000-20000K), suggesting that the\nabundances derived from this line are successfully non-LTE-corrected and\ntrustable. Therefore, according to the results from the AlII 4663 line, we may\nconclude that the Al abundance of the galactic gas in the recent past (several\ntimes ~10^7-10^8 yr ago) is almost consistent with the solar composition. As to\nthe Al abundances of HgMn stars (Teff<15000K), our analysis confirmed that this\nelement is conspicuously deficient (by ~0.5-2 dex in comparison with the Sun)\nin the photosphere of these chemically peculiar stars, as already reported in\nprevious studies.",

However, previous\nmethods focus only on method-specific clues, which easily lead to overfitting,\nwhile overlooking the crucial role of common forgery features. Additionally,\nthey struggle to distinguish between uncertain novel classes in more practical\nopen-world scenarios. To address these issues, in this paper we propose an\ninnovative multi-DisentAnglement based conTrastive leArning framework, DATA, to\nenhance the generalization ability on novel classes for the open-world\nsemi-supervised deepfake attribution (OSS-DFA) task. Specifically, since all\ngeneration techniques can be abstracted into a similar architecture, DATA\ndefines the concept of 'Orthonormal Deepfake Basis' for the first time and\nutilizes it to disentangle method-specific features, thereby reducing the\noverfitting on forgery-irrelevant information. Furthermore, an augmented-memory\nmechanism is designed to assist in novel class discovery and contrastive\nlearning, which aims to obtain clear class boundaries for the novel classes\nthrough instance-level disentanglements. Additionally, to enhance the\nstandardization and discrimination of features, DATA uses bases contrastive\nloss and center contrastive loss as auxiliaries for the aforementioned modules.\nExtensive experimental evaluations show that DATA achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on the OSS-DFA benchmark, e.g., there are notable accuracy\nimprovements in 2.55% / 5.7% under different settings, compared with the\nexisting methods.",

    "abstract": "Medical image registration plays a vital role in medical image processing.\nExtracting expressive representations for medical images is crucial for\nimproving the registration quality. One common practice for this end is\nconstructing a convolutional backbone to enable interactions with skip\nconnections among feature extraction layers. The de facto structure, U-Net-like\nnetworks, has attempted to design skip connections such as nested or full-scale\nones to connect one single encoder and one single decoder to improve its\nrepresentation capacity. Despite being effective, it still does not fully\nexplore interactions with a single encoder and decoder architectures. In this\npaper, we embrace this observation and introduce a simple yet effective\nalternative strategy to enhance the representations for registrations by\nappending one additional decoder. The new decoder is designed to interact with\nboth the original encoder and decoder. In this way, it not only reuses feature\npresentation from corresponding layers in the encoder but also interacts with\nthe original decoder to corporately give more accurate registration results.\nThe new architecture is concise yet generalized, with only one encoder and two\ndecoders forming a ``Tetrahedron'' structure, thereby dubbed Tetrahedron-Net.\nThree instantiations of Tetrahedron-Net are further constructed regarding the\ndifferent structures of the appended decoder. Our extensive experiments prove\nthat superior performance can be obtained on several representative benchmarks\nof medical image registration. Finally, such a ``Tetrahedron'' design can also\nbe easily integrated into popular U-Net-like architectures including\nVoxelMorph, ViT-V-Net, and TransMorph, leading to consistent performance gains.",

The core contribution is an imaging\ncondition-aware sampling strategy that integrates synthetic augmentation to\nmodel variability across imaging conditions. By identifying samples where the\nmodel is both uncertain and sensitive to these conditions, the proposed method\nselectively annotates only the most informative examples. Experiments on both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms all\nbaselines and achieves high classification accuracy with significantly fewer\nlabeled samples.

We explore how classification accuracy\nand calibration are affected by symmetric label noise in active learning\nsettings, evaluating four vision transformer configurations (Base and Large\nwith 16x16 and 32x32 patch sizes) and three Swin Transformer configurations\n(Tiny, Small, and Base) on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, under varying label\nnoise rates.

We find that smaller patch\nsizes do not always lead to better performance, as ViTl16 performs consistently\nworse than ViTl32 while incurring a higher computational cost. We also find\nthat information-based Active Learning strategies only provide meaningful\naccuracy improvements at moderate label noise rates, but they result in poorer\ncalibration compared to models trained on randomly acquired labels, especially\nat high label noise rates.

We derive the condition for autonomous refrigeration and analyze how the\noptimal cold qubit temperature scales with the number of bath qubits. We find a\npower law scaling towards a constant asymptotic value. We also find the scaling\nof the minimum time required for cooling as a function of the number of bath\nspins. Further, we scrutinize the heat currents associated with each of the\nthree qubits.",

This\napproach has already been successfully employed for the game of Checkers. In\nthis work, we describe the application of this method to the context of Connect\nFour, in order to study its performance in a different setting, which can lead\nto a better generalization of the technique. We also kept track of a metric\nthat wasn't taken into account in previous work: the average number of\niterations to obtain a flagged action.

The experiments\ninvolved training and testing classical and quantum RL agents that played\neither going first or going second against a Randomized Negamax opponent.

Such a model would offer substantial advantages in terms of efficiency\nand convenience. In this paper, we introduce UniCO, a unified model for solving\nvarious CO problems.

Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a promising solution by\ndisaggregating total household energy usage, recorded by a central smart meter,\ninto appliance-level data.

This limits understanding of\nregional consumption patterns, such as heavy use of air conditioners and\nelectric water heaters. Second, deep learning models used in NILM require high\ncomputational power, often relying on cloud services.

This coarse-to-fine strategy enables WDMamba to\neffectively capture features specific to each stage of the dehazing process,\nresulting in high-quality restored images. Specifically, in the low-frequency\nrestoration stage, we integrate Mamba blocks to reconstruct global structures\nwith linear complexity, efficiently removing overall haze and producing a\ncoarse restored image.

Correspondingly, a diverse range of methodologies have been\nproposed to compare the spatial expression structure of genes.

We explore the unique advantages of topology for this\ntask, deriving biologically meaningful insights into kidney disease and\nmyocardial infarction using public spatial transcriptomics data. We also show\nhow the non-parametric nature of homology enables our methodology to extend\nnaturally to other spatial omics modalities, demonstrating this on a spatial\nmetabolomics sample. Our work showcases the advantages of using a continuous\nquantification of spatial structure over p-value based approaches to SVG\nidentification, the potential for developing unified methods for the analysis\nof different spatial omics modalities, and the utility of persistent homology\nin big data applications.",

In this paper, we propose a novel\nIsometric Immersion Kernel Learning (IIKL) method to build Riemannian manifold\nand isometrically induce Riemannian metric from discrete non-Euclidean data.

Moreover, a novel parameterized learning model based on IIKL is\nintroduced, and an alternating training method for this model is derived using\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), ensuring efficient convergence.\nExperimental results proved that using the learned Riemannian manifold and its\nmetric, our model preserved the intrinsic geometric representation of data in\nboth 3D and high-dimensional datasets successfully, and significantly improved\nthe accuracy of downstream tasks, such as data reconstruction and\nclassification.

Doing so demands three coordinated\nmoves: broad public access to both compute and capable AI models that are not\nplatform-owned, open interoperability and safety standards, and market\nregulation that prevents platforms from foreclosing competition.",

    "abstract": "The primary epoch of planetary accretion concludes with giant impacts -\nhighly energetic collisions between proto-planets that can play a key role in\nshaping a planet's inventory of volatile elements. Previous work has shown that\nsingle giant impacts have the potential to eject a significant amount of a\nplanet's atmosphere but that the efficiency of atmospheric loss depends\nstrongly on the impact parameters and atmospheric properties. Fully quantifying\nthe role of giant impacts in planetary volatile evolution requires a more\ncomplete understanding of the mechanisms driving loss during impacts. Here, we\nuse a suite of 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to show that loss\nin giant impacts is controlled primarily by ejecta plumes near the impact site\nand breakout of the impact shock in the far field, with the efficiency of the\nlatter well approximated by 1D ground-kick calculations. The relative\ncontributions of each mechanism to loss changes drastically with varying impact\nparameters. By considering the near and far field separately, we present a\nscaling law that precisely approximates (to within an average of $\\sim$3%) loss\nfrom 0.35 to 5.0 Earth mass planets with 5% mass fraction H$_2$-He atmospheres\nfor any combination of impactor mass, impact velocity, and angle. Finally, we\napply our scaling law to the results of $N$-body simulations for different\nsolar system formation scenarios. We find that while individual impacts rarely\ncause significant loss ($>$10%) from roughly Earth-mass planets with such\nmassive primary atmospheres, the cumulative effect of multiple impacts can be\nsubstantial (40-70% loss).",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HeteGNNs) have demonstrated strong\nabilities to learn node representations by effectively extracting complex\nstructural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs. Most of the\nprevailing HeteGNNs follow the neighborhood aggregation paradigm, leveraging\nmeta-path based message passing to learn latent node representations. However,\ndue to the pairwise nature of meta-paths, these models fail to capture\nhigh-order relations among nodes, resulting in suboptimal performance.\nAdditionally, the challenge of ``over-squashing'', where long-range message\npassing in HeteGNNs leads to severe information distortion, further limits the\nefficacy of these models. To address these limitations, this paper proposes\nMGA-HHN, a Multi-Granular Attention based Heterogeneous Hypergraph Neural\nNetwork for heterogeneous graph representation learning. MGA-HHN introduces two\nkey innovations: (1) a novel approach for constructing meta-path based\nheterogeneous hypergraphs that explicitly models higher-order semantic\ninformation in heterogeneous graphs through multiple views, and (2) a\nmulti-granular attention mechanism that operates at both the node and hyperedge\nlevels. This mechanism enables the model to capture fine-grained interactions\namong nodes sharing the same semantic context within a hyperedge type, while\npreserving the diversity of semantics across different hyperedge types. As\nsuch, MGA-HHN effectively mitigates long-range message distortion and generates\nmore expressive node representations.

    "abstract": "DBSCAN, a well-known density-based clustering algorithm, has gained\nwidespread popularity and usage due to its effectiveness in identifying\nclusters of arbitrary shapes and handling noisy data. However, it encounters\nchallenges in producing satisfactory cluster results when confronted with\ndatasets of varying density scales, a common scenario in real-world\napplications. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive and Robust DBSCAN with\nMulti-agent Reinforcement Learning cluster framework, namely AR-DBSCAN. First,\nwe model the initial dataset as a two-level encoding tree and categorize the\ndata vertices into distinct density partitions according to the information\nuncertainty determined in the encoding tree. Each partition is then assigned to\nan agent to find the best clustering parameters without manual assistance. The\nallocation is density-adaptive, enabling AR-DBSCAN to effectively handle\ndiverse density distributions within the dataset by utilizing distinct agents\nfor different partitions. Second, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning\nguided automatic parameter searching process is designed. The process of\nadjusting the parameter search direction by perceiving the clustering\nenvironment is modeled as a Markov decision process. Using a weakly-supervised\nreward training policy network, each agent adaptively learns the optimal\nclustering parameters by interacting with the clusters. Third, a recursive\nsearch mechanism adaptable to the data's scale is presented, enabling efficient\nand controlled exploration of large parameter spaces. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on nine artificial datasets and a real-world dataset. The results of\noffline and online tasks show that AR-DBSCAN not only improves clustering\naccuracy by up to 144.1% and 175.3% in the NMI and ARI metrics, respectively,\nbut also is capable of robustly finding dominant parameters.",

Our conclusion is based on experimental data for $\\pi^0$ production\nrates at photon-nucleus interactions from the A2 collaboration at the Mainz\nMAMI accelerator. We assume that $\\Delta$ resonance decays are independent of\nthe production mechanism (via photon, Z, or W boson). In Neutral Current (NC)\ninteractions, the $1\\pi^0 + X$ production scales as A$^{2/3}$, reflecting the\nnuclear surface area. In contrast, photons from $\\Delta$ decays typically\nescape the nucleus, resulting in a cross-section proportional to the atomic\nnumber A. Thus, in NC interactions, the ratio of {\\gamma} production to $\\pi^0$\nproduction is proportional to A$^{1/3}$.

By establishing reliable\ncross-modal representational alignment, PNBA reveals robust preserved neural\nrepresentations in monkey primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsal premotor cortex\n(PMd) through zero-shot validation. We further establish similar\nrepresentational preservation in mouse primary visual cortex (V1), reflecting a\ngeneral neural basis.

DT\nserves as a fundamental component of many applications, encompassing smart\nmanufacturing, intelligent vehicles, and smart cities. By using Machine\nLearning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, DTs can efficiently\nfacilitate decision-making and productivity by simulating the status and\nchanges of a physical entity. To handle the massive amount of data brought by\nDTs, it is challenging to achieve low response latency for data fetching over\nexisting IP-based networks. IP-based networks use host addresses for end-to-end\ncommunication, making data distribution between DTs inefficient. Thus, we\npropose to use DTs in a distributed manner over Named Data Networking (NDN)\nnetworks. NDN is data-centric where data is routed based on content names,\ndynamically adjusting paths to optimize latency. Popular data is cached in\nnetwork nodes, reducing data transmission and network congestion. Since data is\nfetched by content names, users and mobile devices can move freely without IP\naddress reassignment. By using in-network caching and adaptive routing, we\nreckon NDN is an ideal fit for Future G Networks in the context of Digital\nTwins. We compared DTs in edge scenarios with cloud scenarios over NDN and\nIP-based networks to validate our insights. Extensive simulation results show\nthat using DT in the edge reduces response latency by 10.2x.

    "abstract": "With the increasing adoption of digital techniques, the concept of digital\ntwin (DT) has received a widespread attention in both industry and academia.\nWhile several definitions exist for a DT, most definitions focus on the\nexistence of a virtual entity (VE) of a real-world object or process, often\ncomprising interconnected models which interact with each other, undergoing\nchanges continuously owing to the synchronization with the real-world object.\nThese interactions might lead to inconsistencies at execution time, due to\ntheir highly stochastic and/or time-critical nature, which may lead to\nundesirable behavior. In addition, the continuously varying nature of VE owing\nto its synchronization with the real-world object further contributes to the\ncomplexity arising from these interactions and corresponding model execution\ntimes, which could possibly affect its overall functioning at runtime. This\ncreates a need to perform (continuous) verification of the VE, to ensure that\nit behaves consistently at runtime by adhering to desired properties such as\ndeadlock freeness, functional correctness, liveness and timeliness. Some\ncritical properties such as deadlock freeness can only be verified using\nclassical model checking; on the other hand, statistical model checking\nprovides the possibility to model actual stochastic temporal behavior. We\ntherefore propose to use both these techniques to verify the correctness and\nthe fulfillment of desirable properties of VE. We present our observations and\nfindings from applying these techniques on the DT of an autonomously driving\ntruck. Results from these verification techniques suggest that this DT adheres\nto properties of deadlock freeness and functional correctness, but not adhering\nto timeliness properties.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning to play 3v3 multi-drone\nvolleyball, a new embodied competitive task that requires both high-level\nstrategic coordination and low-level agile control. The task is turn-based,\nmulti-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its\nlong-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated\ndynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play\n(HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates\ncentralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level\nmotion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to\nenable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert\ndemonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level\nstrategy via self-play with fixed low-level controllers, and (III) joint\nfine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior\nperformance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based\nhierarchical baselines with an average 82.9% win rate and a 71.5% win rate\nagainst the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team\nbehaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.

We call this\nparticle a classical Dirac particle. We analyze in detail the way we arrive to\nthis model and how the different observables and constants of the motion can be\nexpressed in terms of the degrees of freedom and their derivatives, by making\nuse of Noether's theorem. The main feature is that the particle has a center of\ncharge r, moving at the speed of light, that satisfies fourth-order diferential\nequations and all observables can be expressed only in terms of this point and\ntheir time derivatives. The particle has also a center of mass q, that is a\ndifferent point than the center of charge. This implies that two different spin\nobservables can be defined, one S with respect to the point r and another SCM\nwith respect to the point q, that satisfy different dynamical equations. The\nspin S satisfies the same dynamical equation than Dirac's spin operator. The\nfourth-order differential equations for the point r can be transformed into a\nsystem of second-order ordinary differential equations for the center of charge\nand center of mass. The dynamics can be described in terms of dimensionless\nvariables. The possible interaction Lagrangians are described and we devote the\nmain part of the work to the electromagnetic interaction of the Dirac particle\nwith uniform and oscillating electric and magnetic fields.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce KERAIA, a novel framework and software platform\nfor symbolic knowledge engineering designed to address the persistent\nchallenges of representing, reasoning with, and executing knowledge in dynamic,\ncomplex, and context-sensitive environments. The central research question that\nmotivates this work is: How can unstructured, often tacit, human expertise be\neffectively transformed into computationally tractable algorithms that AI\nsystems can efficiently utilise? KERAIA seeks to bridge this gap by building on\nfoundational concepts such as Minsky's frame-based reasoning and K-lines, while\nintroducing significant innovations. These include Clouds of Knowledge for\ndynamic aggregation, Dynamic Relations (DRels) for context-sensitive\ninheritance, explicit Lines of Thought (LoTs) for traceable reasoning, and\nCloud Elaboration for adaptive knowledge transformation. This approach moves\nbeyond the limitations of traditional, often static, knowledge representation\nparadigms. KERAIA is designed with Explainable AI (XAI) as a core principle,\nensuring transparency and interpretability, particularly through the use of\nLoTs. The paper details the framework's architecture, the KSYNTH representation\nlanguage, and the General Purpose Paradigm Builder (GPPB) to integrate diverse\ninference methods within a unified structure. We validate KERAIA's versatility,\nexpressiveness, and practical applicability through detailed analysis of\nmultiple case studies spanning naval warfare simulation, industrial diagnostics\nin water treatment plants, and strategic decision-making in the game of RISK.\nFurthermore, we provide a comparative analysis against established knowledge\nrepresentation paradigms (including ontologies, rule-based systems, and\nknowledge graphs) and discuss the implementation aspects and computational\nconsiderations of the KERAIA platform.",

This behavior stands in\nstark contrast with the performance of existing estimators, including those\nbased on entropic regularization, which are asymptotically biased and only\nsatisfy a CLT centered at a regularized version of the population-level plan.\nWe develop a new regularization approach based on a different class of penalty\nfunctions, which can be viewed as the duals of those previously considered in\nthe literature. The key feature of these penalty schemes it that they give rise\nto preliminary estimates that are asymptotically linear in the penalization\nstrength. Our final estimator is obtained by constructing an appropriate linear\ncombination of two penalized solutions corresponding to two different tuning\nparameters so that the bias introduced by the penalization cancels out. Unlike\nclassical debiasing procedures, therefore, our proposal entirely avoids the\ndelicate problem of estimating and then subtracting the estimated bias term.\nOur proofs, which apply beyond the case of optimal transport, are based on a\nnovel asymptotic analysis of penalization schemes for linear programs. As a\ncorollary of our results, we obtain the consistency of the naive bootstrap for\nfully data-driven inference on the true optimal solution. Simulation results\nand two data analyses support strongly the benefits of our approach relative to\nexisting techniques.",

It has been beneficial for\nresearch on clone detection and has become a standard in evaluating the\nperformance of clone detection tools. More recently, it has also been widely\nused as a dataset to evaluate machine learning approaches to semantic clone\ndetection or code similarity detection for functional or semantic similarity.\n  This paper demonstrates that BigCloneBench is problematic to use as ground\ntruth for learning or evaluating semantic code similarity, and highlights the\naspects of BigCloneBench that affect the ground truth quality. A manual\ninvestigation of a statistically significant random sample of 406 Weak\nType-3/Type-4 clone pairs revealed that 93% of them do not have a similar\nfunctionality and are therefore mislabelled. In a literature review of 179\npapers that use BigCloneBench as a dataset, we found 139 papers that used\nBigCloneBench to evaluate semantic clone detection and where the results are\nthreatened in their validity by the mislabelling. As such, these papers often\nreport high F1 scores (e.g., above 0.9), which indicates overfitting to\ndataset-specific artefacts rather than genuine semantic similarity detection.\n  We emphasise that using BigCloneBench remains valid for the intended purpose\nof evaluating syntactic or textual clone detection of Type-1, Type-2, and\nType-3 clones. We acknowledge the important contributions of BigCloneBench to\ntwo decades of traditional clone detection research.

Second, it\nincludes a region location mechanism (RLM) to help escape local optima by\ndynamically adjusting the search space. Finally, it employs a novel variable\nneighborhood descent strategy, ComLS, which combines vertex exchange strategies\nwith a reward mechanism to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate DynLS's superior performance, consistently\ndelivering high-quality solutions within 1000 seconds. DynLS outperformed five\nleading algorithms across 360 test instances, achieving the best solution for\n350 instances and surpassing the second-best algorithm, Cyclic-Fast, by 177\ninstances.

For both local and international trade, inspecting and\nmaintaining the quality of rice grains to satisfy customers and preserve a\ncountry's reputation is necessary. Manual quality check and classification is\nquite a laborious and time-consuming process. It is also highly prone to\nmistakes. Therefore, an automatic solution must be proposed for the effective\nand efficient classification of different varieties of rice grains. This\nresearch paper presents an automatic framework based on a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) for classifying different varieties of rice grains.

However, most current occluded face recognition (OFR) algorithms\nlack prior knowledge of occlusions, resulting in poor performance when dealing\nwith occluded faces of varying types and severity in reality. Recognizing\noccluded faces is still a significant challenge, which greatly affects the\nconvenience of people's daily lives. In this paper, we propose an\nidentity-gated mixture of diffusion experts (MoDE) for OFR. Each\ndiffusion-based generative expert estimates one possible complete image for\noccluded faces. Considering the random sampling process of the diffusion model,\nwhich introduces inevitable differences and variations between the inpainted\nfaces and the real ones. To ensemble effective information from\nmulti-reconstructed faces, we introduce an identity-gating network to evaluate\nthe contribution of each reconstructed face to the identity and adaptively\nintegrate the predictions in the decision space. Moreover, our MoDE is a\nplug-and-play module for most existing face recognition models. Extensive\nexperiments on three public face datasets and two datasets in the wild validate\nour advanced performance for various occlusions in comparison with the\ncompeting methods.",

    "abstract": "Near-field (NF) line-of-sight (LoS) MIMO systems enable efficient channel\nstate information (CSI) acquisition and precoding by exploiting known antenna\ngeometries at both the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE). This paper\nintroduces a compact parameterization of the NF LoS MIMO channel using two\nangles of departure (AoDs) and a BS-UE relative rotation angle. The inclusion\nof the second AoD removes the need for fine-grained distance grids imposed by\nconventional NF channel parametrization. To address the user-specific uplink\npilot overhead in multiuser NF CSI acquisition, we propose a scheme that uses a\nfixed, UE-independent set of downlink pilots transmitted from a carefully\nselected subset of BS antennas. In dominant LoS conditions, as few as four\npilots suffice, with Cram\\'er-Rao bound (CRB) analysis confirming that\nincreased antenna spacing improves estimation accuracy. Each UE estimates and\nquantizes its angular parameters and feeds them back to the BS for\ngeometry-based CSI reconstruction, eliminating the need for full channel\nfeedback. To enhance robustness against noise, quantization errors, and\nnon-line-of-sight (NLoS) components, we introduce a two-stage precoding method.\nThe initial precoding is computed from estimated LoS CSI and refined through\nbidirectional over-the-air (OTA) training.

A novel deep reinforcement learning framework, Proximal\nPolicy Optimization with Adversarial Curriculum Transfer (PPO-ACT), is proposed\nto model agent strategy optimization in dynamic environments. Traditional\nevolutionary game models frequently exhibit limitations in modeling long-term\ndecision-making processes. Deep reinforcement learning effectively addresses\nthis limitation by bridging policy gradient methods with evolutionary game\ntheory. Our study pioneers the application of proximal policy optimization's\ncontinuous strategy optimization capability to public goods games through a\ntwo-stage adversarial curriculum transfer training paradigm. The experimental\nresults show that PPO-ACT performs better in critical enhancement factor\nregimes. Compared to conventional standard proximal policy optimization\nmethods, Q-learning and Fermi update rules, achieve earlier cooperation phase\ntransitions and maintain stable cooperative equilibria. This framework exhibits\nbetter robustness when handling challenging scenarios like all-defector initial\nconditions. Systematic comparisons reveal the unique advantage of policy\ngradient methods in population-scale cooperation, i.e., achieving\nspatiotemporal payoff coordination through value function propagation.

    "abstract": "The AI Incident Database was inspired by aviation safety databases, which\nenable collective learning from failures to prevent future incidents. The\ndatabase documents hundreds of AI failures, collected from the news and media.\nHowever, criticism highlights that the AIID's reliance on media reporting\nlimits its utility for learning about implementation failures. In this paper,\nwe accept that the AIID falls short in its original mission, but argue that by\nlooking beyond technically-focused learning, the dataset can provide new,\nhighly valuable insights: specifically, opportunities to learn about patterns\nbetween developers, deployers, victims, wider society, and law-makers that\nemerge after AI failures. Through a three-tier mixed-methods analysis of 962\nincidents and 4,743 related reports from the AIID, we examine patterns across\nincidents, focusing on cases with public responses tagged in the database. We\nidentify 'typical' incidents found in the AIID, from Tesla crashes to deepfake\nscams.\n  Focusing on this interplay between relevant parties, we uncover patterns in\naccountability and social expectations of responsibility. We find that the\npresence of identifiable responsible parties does not necessarily lead to\nincreased accountability. The likelihood of a response and what it amounts to\ndepends highly on context, including who built the technology, who was harmed,\nand to what extent. Controversy-rich incidents provide valuable data about\nsocietal reactions, including insights into social expectations. Equally\ninformative are cases where controversy is notably absent.

Their population dynamics involve growth and decay processes,\nthe former owing to the balance between biological proliferation and mortality,\nwhile the latter results from mechanical abrasion because of the transport of\nsediment particles, such as sand and gravel. The decay has experimentally been\nidentified to exhibit long memory behavior, where the population decreases at\nan algebraic rate. However, the origin and mathematical theory of this\nphenomenon remain unresolved. This study introduces a novel mathematical model\nemploying spin processes to describe microscopic biofilm dynamics. The\ncontinuum limit of these spin processes captures the long-memory decay and\ngenerates generic growth curves. A spin process is defined as a continuous-time\nstochastic process transitioning between states 0 and 1.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel Two-Stage Diffusion Model (TS-Diff) for enhancing\nextremely low-light RAW images. In the pre-training stage, TS-Diff synthesizes\nnoisy images by constructing multiple virtual cameras based on a noise space.\nCamera Feature Integration (CFI) modules are then designed to enable the model\nto learn generalizable features across diverse virtual cameras. During the\naligning stage, CFIs are averaged to create a target-specific CFI$^T$, which is\nfine-tuned using a small amount of real RAW data to adapt to the noise\ncharacteristics of specific cameras. A structural reparameterization technique\nfurther simplifies CFI$^T$ for efficient deployment. To address color shifts\nduring the diffusion process, a color corrector is introduced to ensure color\nconsistency by dynamically adjusting global color distributions. Additionally,\na novel dataset, QID, is constructed, featuring quantifiable illumination\nlevels and a wide dynamic range, providing a comprehensive benchmark for\ntraining and evaluation under extreme low-light conditions. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that TS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nmultiple datasets, including QID, SID, and ELD, excelling in denoising,\ngeneralization, and color consistency across various cameras and illumination\nlevels. These findings highlight the robustness and versatility of TS-Diff,\nmaking it a practical solution for low-light imaging applications.

    "abstract": "We theoretically investigate the quantum-interference-induced photon blockade\neffect in a single two-level atom-cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system\nwith degenerate parametric amplification. The analytical calculations reveal\nthe optimal parametric gain and phase parameters for achieving optimum\nunconventional photon blockade conditions. Under the optimal parameter regime,\nthe numerical results of the second-order correlation function demonstrate\nstrong photon antibunching consistent with the analytical results. Furthermore,\nthe numerical results corroborate that coherently driving the atom leads to a\nstronger photon blockade than a coherently driven cavity with the optimal\nparameters. We numerically demonstrate that the UPB effect is compromised by a\nnon-zero cavity-atom coupling in the cavity-driven configuration. However,\nstronger photon antibunching can be attained with a non-zero cavity-atom\ncoupling in the atom-driven configuration. This work may be suitable for\nexperimentally realising a strongly antibunched single-photon source for\napplications in quantum technology.",

Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based\npipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled\nnuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient\nsamples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma\nskin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell\nnuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients,\nHisto-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for\nnucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation.\nPerformance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with\nmulti-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation,\nmacro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection\nover Union (mIoU) of 0.884 for tumor region segmentation. From these\npredictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology\nand cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks.\nHere, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy\nbased on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies\npercentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor\nvicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as\npredictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of\nHisto-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation\nof the classification and insights into the underlying biology.",

The results showed that after the deployment of energy\nstorage, the amount of wind and solar power curtailment in each park decreased,\nand the operational costs were reduced. Finally, a genetic algorithm was used\nto optimize the energy storage configuration of each park. The energy storage\noperation strategy was optimized through fitness functions, crossover\noperations, and mutation operations. After optimization, the economic\nindicators of Parks A, B, and C all improved.

In this paper, we innovatively utilize the\nLocation-Scale Noise Model (LSNM) to relax the fixed uncertainty assumption of\nANM. A diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework, termed\nNon-stationary Diffusion (NsDiff), is designed based on LSNM that is capable of\nmodeling the changing pattern of uncertainty. Specifically, NsDiff combines a\ndenoising diffusion-based conditional generative model with a pre-trained\nconditional mean and variance estimator, enabling adaptive endpoint\ndistribution modeling. Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty-aware noise\nschedule, which dynamically adjusts the noise levels to accurately reflect the\ndata uncertainty at each step and integrates the time-varying variances into\nthe diffusion process.

    "abstract": "Airline operations are prone to delays and disruptions, since the schedules\nare generally tight and depend on a lot of resources. When disruptions occur,\nthe flight schedule needs to be adjusted such that the operation can continue.\nSince this happens during the day of operations, this needs to be done as close\nto real time as possible, posing a challenge with respect to computation time.\nMoreover, to limit the impact of disruptions, we want a solution with minimal\ncost and passenger impact. Since airline operations include many interlinked\ndecisions, an integrated approach leads to better overall solutions. We\nspecifically look at resolving these disruptions in both the aircraft and crew\nschedules. Resolving these disruptions is complex, especially when it is done\nin an integrated way, i.e. including multiple different resources.\n  To solve this problem in an integrated manner, we developed a fast simulated\nannealing approach. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop a\nlocal search approach to resolve airline disruptions in an integrated way. This\napproach is compared with traditional approaches, and an experimental study is\ndone to evaluate different neighbour generation methods, and to investigate\ndifferent recovery scenarios and strategies. The comparison is done using real\nworld data from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Here, we show that our approach\nresolves disruptions quickly and in a cost-efficient manner, and that it\noutperforms traditional approaches. Compared to naive delay propagation, our\nmethod saves 40% in non-performance costs. Moreover, while most airlines use\ntools that consider resources separately, our approach shows that integrated\ndisruption management is possible within 30 seconds.",

This is particularly\ninteresting to study in more complex or potentially unfair scenarios when user\npreferences diverge, such as in a minority scenario (where group members have\nsimilar preferences, except for a single member in a minority position). In\nthis paper, we analyzed the impact of different types of explanations on user\nunderstanding of group recommendations. We present a randomized controlled\ntrial (n = 271) using two between-subject factors: (i) the aggregation strategy\n(additive, least misery, and approval voting), and (ii) the modality of\nexplanation (no explanation, textual explanation, or multimodal explanation).\nWe measured both subjective (self-perceived by the user) and objective\nunderstanding (performance on model simulation, counterfactuals and error\ndetection). In line with recent findings on explanations for machine learning\nmodels, our results indicate that more detailed explanations, whether textual\nor multimodal, did not increase subjective or objective understanding. However,\nwe did find a significant effect of aggregation strategies on both subjective\nand objective understanding. These results imply that when constructing GRS,\npractitioners need to consider that the choice of aggregation strategy can\ninfluence the understanding of users.

Our\nwork presents the first TC algorithm that leverages the capabilities of the\nUPMEM system, the first commercially available PIM architecture, while at the\nsame time addressing its limitations. We use a vertex coloring technique to\navoid expensive communication between PIM cores and employ reservoir sampling\nto address the limited amount of memory available in the PIM cores' DRAM banks.\nIn addition, our work makes use of the Misra-Gries summary to speed up counting\ntriangles on graphs with high-degree nodes and uniform sampling of the graph\nedges for quicker approximate results. Our PIM implementation surpasses\nstate-of-the-art CPU-based TC implementations when processing dynamic graphs in\nCoordinate List format, showcasing the effectiveness of the UPMEM architecture\nin addressing TC's memory-bound challenges.",

    "abstract": "The use of Berry-phase concepts has established a strong link between the\nanomalous Hall effect (AHE) and the topological character of the Hall currents.\nHowever, the occurrence of sign competition in the Berry curvature often\nhinders the topological origin of the observed anomalous Hall effects. Here, we\nstudy a two-dimensional topological ferromagnet with coupled spin and orbital\ndegrees of freedom to assess the anomalous Hall effects in the presence of\nsign-competing sources of Berry curvature. We show that 2D itinerant\ntopological ferromagnets described by t2g electronic states can generally lead\nto topological metallic bands marked by a non-zero Chern number. We find that\nthe resulting Berry curvature at the Fermi level exhibits a characteristic\nanisotropic profile with a non-monotonous angular dependence when the\nmagnetization is reversed. The sign change of the intrinsic contribution to the\nanomalous Hall conductance can occur together with topological transitions or\nbe driven by the population imbalance of the topological bands. The breaking of\nthe inversion symmetry introduces the orbital Rashba coupling in the system.\nThe interplay between the orbital Rashba and sign competing sources of Berry\ncurvature leads to anomalies in the anomalous Hall conductance at values of\nmagnetic fields for which the magnetization switches its orientation. The humps\nin topological ferromagnets arise when the anomalous Hall conductivity is small\nin absolute value and they can be detected only close to the sign-change of the\nAHE and far from half-filling. This study could be relevant for the family of\nthe topological 2D ferromagnets as well as Weyl ferromagnets, and can\nparticularly account for the variety of unconventional behaviors observed in\nultrathin films of SrRuO$_3$.",

As a\nconsequence, we obtain the first example of an infinite-dimensional reflexive\nBanach space that admits a tiling with balls (of radius $1$). Further, our\ntiling has the property of being point-countable and lattice (in the sense that\nthe set of translates forms a group). The same construction performed in\n$\\ell_1(\\Gamma)$ yields a point-$2$-finite lattice tiling by balls of radius\n$1$ for $\\ell_1(\\Gamma)$, which compares to a celebrated construction due to\nKlee. We also prove that lattice tilings by balls are never disjoint and, more\ngenerally, each tile intersects as many tiles as the cardinality of the tiling.\nFinally, we prove some results concerning discrete subgroups of normed spaces.\nBy a simplification of the proof of our main result, we prove that every\ninfinite-dimensional normed space contains a subgroup that is $1$-separated and\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-dense, for every $\\varepsilon>0$; further, the subgroup\nadmits a set of generators of norm at most $2+\\varepsilon$.

The\nresulting neural network is fully model-based, making it lightweight and\ninterpretable with very few learnable parameters. The channel estimation step\nis performed using the unfolded matching pursuit algorithm, accounting for\nimperfect knowledge of the antenna system, while the precoding step is done via\nunfolded projected gradient ascent.

In this paper, we investigate the eavesdropping\nattack in underwater MI communication to quantitatively measure the system's\nvulnerability under this attack. We consider different potential eavesdropping\nconfiguration setups based on the positions and orientations of the\neavesdropper node to investigate how they impact the received voltage and\nsecrecy at the legitimate receiver node. To this end, we develop\nfinite-element-method-based simulation models for each configuration in an\nunderwater environment and evaluate the received voltage and the secrecy\ncapacity against different system parameters such as magnetic flux, magnetic\nflux density, distance, and orientation sensitivity. Furthermore, we construct\nan experimental setup within a laboratory environment to replicate the\nsimulation experiments. Both simulation and lab experimental confirm the\nsusceptibility of underwater MI communication to eavesdropping attacks.\nHowever, this vulnerability is highly dependent on the position and orientation\nof the coil between the eavesdropper and the legitimate transmitter. On the\npositive side, we also observe a unique behavior in the received coil reception\nthat might be used to detect malicious node activities in the vicinity, which\nmight lead to a potential security mechanism against eavesdropping attacks.",

Accurately modeling this problem presents substantial challenges\ndue to the complex physics involved in strongly coupled thermo-poromechanical\nprocesses and the frictional contact mechanics of fractures. To resolve process\ncouplings in the resulting mathematical model, it is common to apply fully\nimplicit time stepping. This necessitates the use of an iterative linear solver\nto run the model. The solver's efficiency primarily depends on a robust\npreconditioner, which is particularly challenging to develop because it must\nhandle the mutual couplings between linearized contact mechanics and energy,\nmomentum, and mass balance. In this work, we introduce a preconditioner for the\nproblem based on the nested approximations of Schur complements. To decouple\nthe momentum balance, we utilize the fixed-stress approximation, extended to\naccount for both the porous media and fracture subdomains. The singularity of\nthe contact mechanics submatrix is resolved by a linear transformation. Two\nvariations of the algorithm are proposed to address the coupled mass and energy\nbalance submatrix: either the Constrained Pressure Residual or the System-AMG\napproach. The preconditioner is evaluated through numerical experiments of\nfluid injection into fractured porous media, which causes thermal contraction\nand subsequent sliding and opening of fractures. The experiments show that the\npreconditioner performs robustly for a wide range of simulation regimes\ngoverned by various fracture states, friction coefficients and Peclet number.\nThe grid refinement experiments demonstrate that the preconditioner scales well\nin terms of GMRES iterations, in both two and three dimensions.",

The\nhybrid method consistently selects the longest possible decomposition,\nachieving the lowest error but at the cost of exponential gate overhead, while\nfractional decompositions often match or exceed this performance with far fewer\ngates, enabling offline selection of near-optimal approximants for practical\nquantum simulation.

    "abstract": "The antiferromagnetic heavy-fermion compound Ce$_2$RhIn$_8$ belongs to the\nsame family and bears similarities with the well-studied prototypical material\nCeRhIn$_5$, which demonstrates a unique behavior under applied magnetic field.\nHere, we report specific-heat measurements on a high-quality single crystal of\nCe$_2$RhIn$_8$ in magnetic fields up to 35 T applied along both principal\ncrystallographic directions. When the magnetic field is applied along the $a$\naxis of the tetragonal crystal structure, two additional field-induced\nantiferromagnetic phases are observed, in agreement with previous reports. One\nof them is confined in a small area of the field-temperature phase diagram. The\nother one, which develops above $\\sim$2.5 T, is very robust against the field.\nIts transition temperature increases with field, reaches a maximum at $\\sim$12\nT, and then starts to decrease. However, it tends to saturate towards the\nhighest field of our measurements. For a field applied along the $c$ axis, the\nN\\'{e}el temperature, $T_N$, initially decreases with field, as expected for a\ntypical antiferromagnet. Surprisingly, an additional phase emerges above\n$\\sim$10 T. It is most likely to be of the same origin as its counterpart\nobserved above 2.5 T for the other field orientation. This phase is also\nunusually robust: Its transition temperature increases all the way up to 35 T,\nwhere it exceeds the zero field $T_N =$~2.85 K. Finally, for both field\ndirections, the phase diagrams contain rarely observed tricritical points of\nsecond-order phase transitions.",

    "abstract": "The LHC beam dumps are responsible for the safe absorption of the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC) particle beams. In 2018, the two 6.4-tonne beam dumps\nthat had been in operation since the LHC's startup in 2008 were removed and\nreplaced with upgraded versions. Endoscopic inspections of these beam dumps and\nexperimental high-intensity proton-beam irradiation of material samples raised\nconcerns about the structural integrity of the carbon-based materials in their\ncores. It was therefore decided to undertake an accelerated project of\ndismantling and post-irradiation examination of the removed dumps as part of a\nwider program of work to ensure the safe operation of the LHC beam dumps in the\ncoming years. This paper describes the decommissioning process for the two beam\ndumps carried out at CERN between 2021 and 2023, covering the preparatory\nstudies, practical challenges encountered, and solutions implemented. It\ndetails the establishment of an operational framework, including the\npreparation of the working environment, the development of a method for cutting\nthe irradiated 12-mm-thick duplex stainless-steel vessel, and the cut\nsequencing. Additionally, the paper presents the findings derived from the\npost-irradiation examination of the different carbon-based core materials\nsubjected to deposited energy densities up to 1.5 kJ/g. The extruded graphite\nplates within the vessel exhibited a cracking pattern, which was likely due to\nthe dynamic response of the device upon beam impact, and their retaining rings\nwere found to be displaced. Despite minor signs of surface deterioration, the\nexpanded graphite sheets were intact, and the isostatic graphite blocks showed\nno evidence of material degradation.",

A particular objective was to\ndetermine the effects of various growth barriers, mimicked by imposing a series\nof upper permissible limits on maximum dust sizes. Methods. We used the\nFormation and Evolution of Stars and Disks on nested meshes (ngFEOSAD) code to\nsimulate the three-dimensional dynamics of gas and dust under the polytropic\napproximation, from the gravitational collapse of a slowly rotating\nBonnor-Ebert sphere to \\approx 12 kyr after the first hydrostatic core and disk\nformation. Results. We found that dust growth begins in the contracting cloud\nin the evolution stage that precedes disk formation, and that the disk begins\nto form in an environment already enriched with grown dust. The efficiency of\ndust growth in the disk is limited by dust growth barriers. For dust grains\nwith maximum sizes < 100 micron, electrostatic or bouncing barriers likely\ndominate, whereas fragmentation and drift barriers are more important for\nlarger grains. The disk midplane quickly becomes enriched with dust, while the\nvertically integrated dust distribution shows notable local variations around\nthe canonical 1:100 dust-to-gas mass ratio. These positive and negative\ndeviations are likely caused by local hydrodynamic flows, as the globally\nintegrated dust-to-gas ratio deviates negligibly from the initial 1:100 value.\nWe note that care should be taken when using models with fixed dust sizes, as\ndisks exhibit profound negative radial gradients in dust size even during the\nearliest stages of disk formation. Models with a constant Stokes number may be\npreferable in this context. Conclusions. Early dust enrichment and growth may\nfacilitate planet formation, as suggested by observations of protoplanetary\ndisk substructures.",

To enhance accuracy during the reasoning process, external\nProcess Reward Models (PRMs) can be introduced during training and inference to\nprovide fine-grained supervision. However, if misused, PRMs may distort the\nreasoning trajectory and lead to suboptimal or incorrect SQL generation. To\naddress this challenge, we propose Reward-SQL, a framework that systematically\nexplores how to incorporate PRMs into the Text-to-SQL reasoning process\neffectively. Our approach follows a \"cold start, then PRM supervision\"\nparadigm. Specifically, we first train the model to decompose SQL queries into\nstructured stepwise reasoning chains using common table expressions\n(Chain-of-CTEs), establishing a strong and interpretable reasoning baseline.\nThen, we investigate four strategies for integrating PRMs, and find that\ncombining PRM as an online training signal (e.g.,GRPO) with PRM-guided\ninference (e.g., best-of-N sampling) yields the best results. Empirically, on\nthe BIRD benchmark, Reward-SQL enables models supervised by PRM (7B) to achieve\na 13.1% performance gain across various guidance strategies. Notably, our\nGRPO-aligned policy model based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct achieves 68.9%\naccuracy on the BIRD development set, outperforming all baseline methods under\nthe same model size. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Reward-SQL\nin leveraging reward-based supervision for Text-to-SQL reasoning.",

The issue of ensuring the continuity of\ndisplacement and slope between elements is addressed by the use of cubic\nHermite-type Partition of Unity (PU) functions. With appropriate PU functions,\nthe PUFEM allows the incorporation of the special enrichment functions into the\nfinite elements to better cope with plate oscillations in a broad frequency\nband. The enrichment strategies consist of the sum of a power series up to a\ngiven order and a combination of progressive flexural wave solutions with\npolynomials. The applicability and the effectiveness of the PUFEM plate\nelements is first verified via the structural frequency response. Investigation\nis then carried out to analyze the role of polynomial enrichment orders and\nenriched plane wave distributions for achieving good computational performance\nin terms of accuracy and data reduction. Numerical results show that the PUFEM\nwith high-order polynomials and hybrid wave-polynomial combinations can provide\nhighly accurate prediction results by using reduced degrees of freedom and\nimproved rate of convergence, as compared with the classical FEM.",

The ground state degeneracy in\ndisordered configurations is detected and compared to the regular lattice\nwithout disorder.

Finally, we perform comparative studies by artificially increasing\nthe photoionization intensity through multiplying the photoionization source\nterm Sph by a factor of 10 (10*Sph) relative to the baseline intensity.\nRegarding breakdown voltage prediction, 10*Sph leads to a significant\nunderestimation of the breakdown voltage for positive streamers, introducing\nerrors greater than 0.5 kV, while exerting a relatively small impact on\nnegative streamers. Regarding streamer propagation dynamics, 10*Sph reduces the\ncontraction at the positive streamer head and significantly lowers the local\nfield by more than 700 Td, thereby slowing down its speed. In contrast, 10*Sph\nhas little impact on the morphology of the negative streamers and slightly\nenhances the local field by less than 200 Td, thereby consistently accelerating\nits propagation.",

In this article, we study random walks\nwith resetting on hypergraph by utilizing\n  spectral theory. Specifically, we derive exact expressions for some\nfundamental yet key parameters, including occupation\n  probability, stationary distribution, and mean first passage time, all of\nwhich are expressed in terms of the eigenvalues\n  and eigenvectors of the transition matrix. Furthermore, we provide a general\ncondition for determining the optimal\n  reset probability and a sufficient condition for its existence. In addition,\nwe build up a close relationship between\n  random walks with resetting on hypergraph and simple random walks.\nConcretely, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors\n  of the former can be precisely represented by those of the latter. More\nimportantly, when considering random walks,\n  we abandon the traditional approach of converting hypergraph into a graph and\npropose a research framework that\n  preserves the intrinsic structure of hypergraph itself, which is based on\nassigning proper weights to neighboring nodes.\n  Through extensive experiments, we show that the new framework produces\ndistinct and more reliable results than\n  the traditional approach in node ranking.

    "abstract": "The art of instrument performance stands as a vivid manifestation of human\ncreativity and emotion. Nonetheless, generating instrument performance motions\nis a highly challenging task, as it requires not only capturing intricate\nmovements but also reconstructing the complex dynamics of the\nperformer-instrument interaction. While existing works primarily focus on\nmodeling partial body motions, we propose Expressive ceLlo performance motion\nGeneration for Audio Rendition (ELGAR), a state-of-the-art diffusion-based\nframework for whole-body fine-grained instrument performance motion generation\nsolely from audio. To emphasize the interactive nature of the instrument\nperformance, we introduce Hand Interactive Contact Loss (HICL) and Bow\nInteractive Contact Loss (BICL), which effectively guarantee the authenticity\nof the interplay. Moreover, to better evaluate whether the generated motions\nalign with the semantic context of the music audio, we design novel metrics\nspecifically for string instrument performance motion generation, including\nfinger-contact distance, bow-string distance, and bowing score. Extensive\nevaluations and ablation studies are conducted to validate the efficacy of the\nproposed methods. In addition, we put forward a motion generation dataset\nSPD-GEN, collated and normalized from the MoCap dataset SPD. As demonstrated,\nELGAR has shown great potential in generating instrument performance motions\nwith complicated and fast interactions, which will promote further development\nin areas such as animation, music education, interactive art creation, etc.",

However, A/B testing is\nchallenging in the presence of interference, commonly occurring in social\nnetworks, where individuals can impact each others outcome. Moreover, A/B\ntesting can incur a high performance loss when one of the treatment arms has a\npoor performance and the test continues to treat individuals with it.\nTherefore, it is important to design a strategy that can adapt over time and\nefficiently learn the total treatment effect in the network. We introduce two\ncluster-based multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms to gradually estimate the\ntotal treatment effect in a network while maximizing the expected reward by\nmaking a tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. We compare the\nperformance of our MAB algorithms with a vanilla MAB algorithm that ignores\nclusters and the corresponding RCT methods on semi-synthetic data with\nsimulated interference.

Despite\nsubstantial advancements, including the introduction of transformer-based\narchitectures, current SCD models continue to struggle with challenges such as\nnoisy inputs, subtle class boundaries, and significant class imbalance. In this\nstudy, we propose enhancing the Semantic Change Network (SCanNet) by\nintegrating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and employing Dice\nloss during training. CBAM sequentially applies channel attention to highlight\nfeature maps with the most meaningful content, followed by spatial attention to\npinpoint critical regions within these maps. This sequential approach ensures\nprecise suppression of irrelevant features and spatial noise, resulting in more\naccurate and robust detection performance compared to attention mechanisms that\napply both processes simultaneously or independently. Dice loss, designed\nexplicitly for handling class imbalance, further boosts sensitivity to minority\nchange classes. Quantitative experiments conducted on the SECOND dataset\ndemonstrate consistent improvements. Qualitative analysis confirms these\nimprovements, showing clearer segmentation boundaries and more accurate\nrecovery of small-change regions.

    "abstract": "Generating a synthetic population that is both feasible and diverse is\ncrucial for ensuring the validity of downstream activity schedule simulation in\nactivity-based models (ABMs). While deep generative models (DGMs), such as\nvariational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, have been applied\nto this task, they often struggle to balance the inclusion of rare but\nplausible combinations (i.e., sampling zeros) with the exclusion of implausible\nones (i.e., structural zeros). To improve feasibility while maintaining\ndiversity, we propose a fine-tuning method for large language models (LLMs)\nthat explicitly controls the autoregressive generation process through\ntopological orderings derived from a Bayesian Network (BN). Experimental\nresults show that our hybrid LLM-BN approach outperforms both traditional DGMs\nand proprietary LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT-4o) with few-shot learning. Specifically,\nour approach achieves approximately 95% feasibility, significantly higher than\nthe ~80% observed in DGMs, while maintaining comparable diversity, making it\nwell-suited for practical applications. Importantly, the method is based on a\nlightweight open-source LLM, enabling fine-tuning and inference on standard\npersonal computing environments. This makes the approach cost-effective and\nscalable for large-scale applications, such as synthesizing populations in\nmegacities, without relying on expensive infrastructure.

    "abstract": "The Heisenberg uncertainty inequality is used to derive a rigorous lower\nbound to the amount of isospin impurities, caused by the violation of isospin\nsymmetry in $N=Z$ atomic nuclei, in terms of the difference between the neutron\nand proton radii and the sum of the charge exchange monopole strengths. We show\nthat the inequality reduces to an identity if one employs a simplified mean\nfield expression for the isovector component of the Coulomb force in first\norder perturbation theory. The uncertainty inequality is also employed to\nderive an upper bound to the isovector dipole moment in terms of the amount of\nisospin impurities, thereby providing an insightful connection between the\nviolation of parity and isospin symmetries.",

    "abstract": "The generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups aims to recover a\nset of matrices, representing an unknown signal, from their associated Gram\nmatrices, leveraging prior structural knowledge about the signal. This\nframework generalizes the classical phase retrieval problem, which reconstructs\na signal from the magnitudes of its Fourier transform, to a richer setting\ninvolving non-abelian compact groups. In this broader context, the unknown\nphases in Fourier space are replaced by unknown orthogonal matrices that arise\nfrom the action of a compact group on a finite-dimensional vector space. This\nproblem is primarily motivated by advances in electron microscopy to\ndetermining the 3D structure of biological macromolecules from highly noisy\nobservations. To capture realistic assumptions from machine learning and signal\nprocessing, we model the signal as belonging to one of several broad structural\nfamilies: a generic linear subspace, a sparse representation in a generic\nbasis, the output of a generic ReLU neural network, or a generic\nlow-dimensional manifold. Our main result shows that, under mild conditions,\nthe generalized phase retrieval problem not only admits a unique solution (up\nto inherent group symmetries), but also satisfies a bi-Lipschitz property. This\nimplies robustness to both noise and model mismatch, an essential requirement\nfor practical use, especially when measurements are severely corrupted by\nnoise. These findings provide theoretical support for a wide class of\nscientific problems under modern structural assumptions, and they offer strong\nfoundations for developing robust algorithms in high-noise regimes.",

Node-specific\nflux and velocity are derived using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, and\nsurfactant adsorption is modeled using the Langmuir isotherm, capturing its\nimpact on fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interfaces within the invaded path. Since\nthe evolution of the invasion pattern comprises the cooperative mechanisms of\nsurfactant mass transfer to the interfaces and the resulting changes in\ncapillary and Laplace pressures, we employ two strategies to quantify this\ncomplex feedback behavior: mass transfer-based, introducing a mass transfer\ntimescale, and Laplace pressure-based, scaling with the inlet pressure. Results\nreveal that an anomalous or heavy-tailed pore throat distribution accelerates\nthe onset of secondary invasions, which enhances the dominance of Laplace\npressure. As the distribution becomes less anomalous or more symmetric, mass\ntransfer becomes the dominant mechanism.

In addition to the whispering gallery\nmode and surface plasmon polaritons, the cavity also induces Fabry-P\\'erot (FP)\nresonance, whose orientation is tunable via cavity rotation. Thus, our cavity\npossesses much stronger field confinement and higher Q than a circular cavity\nlacking FP resonance.

This paper gives a holistic analysis of the interaction\nbetween GFM inverter-based resources (IBRs) and the supervising elements in\nprotective relays, including directional and phase selection elements. It is\nrevealed that the current limiting control (CLC) that is based on the current\nreference saturation method, adversely affects the performance of supervising\nelements that rely on the negative-sequence quantities. In contrast, adopting\nhighly inductive virtual impedance in the CLC enables a reliable operation of\nsuch elements.

It is further found that even with a highly\ninductive virtual impedance, the altered virtual impedance dynamics introduced\nby the CLC can still lead to malfunctions of the incremental quantity-based\nsupervising elements.

In general, these outflows play a pivotal role\nin regulating the star formation processes by injecting energetic material in\nthe parent molecular clouds. In such process, lower velocity components of\noutflows contain a significant portion of the energy. However, extraction of\nthose component is difficult as the corresponding gas is often mixed with that\nof the ambient cloud. In our sample, we identified 44 bipolar outflows and one\nexplosive outflow in HC$_3$N (J=11--10). The host clumps of these outflows are\nfound to be at different evolutionary stages, suggesting that outflows in\nHC$_3$N are detectable in different stages of star formation. Also, the\nnon-correlation of HC$_3$N outflows with clump evolutionary stages suggests\nthat HC$_3$N is an unbiased tracer of outflows. Analyses revealed that HC$_3$N\nperforms slightly better in detecting low-velocity components of outflows than\ntraditionally employed tracers like SiO. The derived outflow parameters (i.e\noutflow mass, momentum, and energy) show moderate correlations with clump mass\nand luminosity. Our analysis of outflow opening angles and position-velocity\ndiagrams across the outflow lobes show that, HC$_3$N is not only a good tracer\nof low-velocity outflows, but can also detect high-velocity collimated\noutflows. Overall, this study indicates that HC$_3$N can be used as a\ncomplementary outflow tracer along with the traditionally known outflow\ntracers, particularly in the detection of the low-velocity components of\noutflows.",

The two blazars, GB6\nJ2113+1121 and NVSS J171822+423948, are Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs)\nwith redshifts greater than unity. In particular, NVSS J171822+423948 has a\nredshift of 2.7, which provides an important probe for studying the radiation\nprocesses of jets from active galactic nuclei in the early universe.

    "abstract": "The worldline formalism offers an alternative framework to the standard\ndiagrammatic approach in quantum field theory, grounded in first-quantized\nrelativistic path integrals. Over recent decades, this formalism has attracted\ngrowing interest due to its potential applications and computational\nadvantages. As a result, a collection of worldline master integrals has been\nderived within this approach. However, efficient mathematical tools for\nevaluating these integrals remain limited.\n  Motivated by unitarity methods used in the conventional formalism of quantum\nfield theory, this work proposes a novel framework for evaluating one-loop\nworldline master integrals, up to a rational function in the kinematical\nexternal invariants, through the computation of their discontinuities.\nSimilarly to standard unitarity techniques, the method involves decomposing an\n$n$-point one loop amplitude in $D=4$ dimensions into a linear combination of\ntadpole, bubble, triangle, and box master integrals. The coefficients of this\ndecomposition are rational functions of the external kinematic invariants. Each\nmaster integral exhibits a characteristic discontinuity with respect to a\nspecific kinematic invariant. Consequently, the rational coefficients can be\ndetermined by directly computing the discontinuities of the corresponding\nworldline master integrals. In the three-point and four-point on-shell cases,\nthis computation is particularly tractable, as the discontinuities involve\nDirac delta functions arising from the Sokhotski-Plemelj formula, which\nsimplify the resulting integrals.\n  For the four-point on-shell case, a set of master formulas for the\ndiscontinuities is derived.

Existing solutions on modeling molecules utilize Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to achieve representations but they mostly fail to adapt models\nto out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Although recent advances on OOD-oriented\ngraph learning have discovered the invariant rationale on graphs, they still\nignore three important issues, i.e., 1) the expanding atom patterns regarding\nenvironments on graphs lead to failures of invariant rationale based models, 2)\nthe associations between discovered molecular subgraphs and corresponding\nproperties are complex where causal substructures cannot fully interpret the\nlabels. 3) the interactions between environments and invariances can influence\nwith each other thus are challenging to be modeled. To this end, we propose a\nsoft causal learning framework, to tackle the unresolved OOD challenge in\nmolecular science, from the perspective of fully modeling the molecule\nenvironments and bypassing the invariant subgraphs.

As automation increases also in\nclinical settings, such as for transcription of patient-provider conversations,\nthere is growing potential for LLMs to automatically analyze and extract social\nbehaviors from these interactions. To explore the foundational capabilities of\nLLMs in tracking social signals in clinical dialogue, we designed task-specific\nprompts and evaluated model performance across multiple architectures and\nprompting styles using a highly imbalanced, annotated dataset spanning 20\ndistinct social signals such as provider dominance, patient warmth, etc. We\npresent the first system capable of tracking all these 20 coded signals, and\nuncover patterns in LLM behavior. Further analysis of model configurations and\nclinical context provides insights for enhancing LLM performance on social\nsignal processing tasks in healthcare settings.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the regeneration process of damaged muscle tissue is a fundamental\nanalysis in muscle research to measure experimental effect sizes and uncover\nmechanisms behind muscle weakness due to aging and disease. The conventional\napproach to assessing muscle tissue regeneration involves whole-slide imaging\nand expert visual inspection of the recovery stages based on the morphological\ninformation of cells and fibers. There is a need to replace these tasks with\nautomated methods incorporating machine learning techniques to ensure a\nquantitative and objective analysis. Given the limited availability of fully\nlabeled data, a possible approach is Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), a\nweakly supervised learning method using class label proportions. However,\ncurrent LLP methods have two limitations: (1) they cannot adapt the feature\nextractor for muscle tissues, and (2) they treat the classes representing\nrecovery stages and cell morphological changes as nominal, resulting in the\nloss of ordinal information. To address these issues, we propose Ordinal Scale\nLearning from Similarity Proportion (OSLSP), which uses a similarity proportion\nloss derived from two bag combinations. OSLSP can update the feature extractor\nby using class proportion attention to the ordinal scale of the class. Our\nmodel with OSLSP outperforms large-scale pre-trained and fine-tuning models in\nclassification tasks of skeletal muscle recovery stages.",

The BD-ARIS adopts a\ngroup-connected structure to enhance signal amplification and adaptability,\nwhile RSMA enables efficient multi-user access by dividing messages into common\nand private components. The system jointly optimizes satellite beamforming, UAV\npositioning, power allocation, and rate-splitting ratios to maximize the\noverall energy efficiency (EE). To solve the resulting non-convex and\nhigh-dimensional problem, we employ three state-of-the-art deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) algorithms: Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Twin\nDelayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), and Asynchronous Advantage\nActor-Critic (A3C). Moreover, realistic models for the power consumption of\nboth the UAV and the BD-ARIS are considered. Simulation results reveal that\nTRPO consistently achieves the best performance in terms of EE and sum rate,\nespecially under high transmit powers and challenging deployment scenarios. TD3\nconverges faster and performs competitively in moderate settings, while A3C\nsuffers from instability due to its high variance. Additionally, the robustness\nof each algorithm under channel state information (CSI) uncertainty is\nevaluated, confirming TRPO resilience to imperfect observations. Overall, the\nproposed RSMA-BD-ARIS framework significantly outperforms conventional\nRIS-assisted designs and provides a scalable, energy-efficient solution for 6G\nand massive IoT applications in non-terrestrial networks.",

The IMV number $\\mu_{i}$ and the\nIMV chromatic number $\\chi_{\\mu_{i}}$ are defined as maximum and minimum\ncardinality taken over all IMV sets and IMV colorings, respectively.

Traditional GCL optimizes\nInfoNCE by using augmentations to define self-supervised tasks, treating\naugmented pairs as positive samples and others as negative. However, this leads\nto semantically similar pairs being classified as negative, causing significant\nsampling bias and limiting performance. In this paper, we argue that GCL is\nessentially a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning problem, where the definition of\nself-supervised tasks should be semantically guided, i.e., augmented samples\nwith similar semantics are considered positive, while others, with unknown\nsemantics, are treated as unlabeled. From this perspective, the key lies in how\nto extract semantic information. To achieve this, we propose IFL-GCL, using\nInfoNCE as a \"free lunch\" to extract semantic information. Specifically, We\nfirst prove that under InfoNCE, the representation similarity of node pairs\naligns with the probability that the corresponding contrastive sample is\npositive. Then we redefine the maximum likelihood objective based on the\ncorrected samples, leading to a new InfoNCE loss function. Extensive\nexperiments on both the graph pretraining framework and LLM as an enhancer show\nsignificantly improvements of IFL-GCL in both IID and OOD scenarios, achieving\nup to a 9.05% improvement, validating the effectiveness of semantically guided.\nCode for IFL-GCL is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/Camel-Prince/IFL-GCL.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the Learning Hyperplane Tree (LHT), a novel oblique decision\ntree model designed for expressive and interpretable classification. LHT\nfundamentally distinguishes itself through a non-iterative,\nstatistically-driven approach to constructing splitting hyperplanes. Unlike\nmethods that rely on iterative optimization or heuristics, LHT directly\ncomputes the hyperplane parameters, which are derived from feature weights\nbased on the differences in feature expectations between classes within each\nnode. This deterministic mechanism enables a direct and well-defined hyperplane\nconstruction process. Predictions leverage a unique piecewise linear membership\nfunction within leaf nodes, obtained via local least-squares fitting. We\nformally analyze the convergence of the LHT splitting process, ensuring that\neach split yields meaningful, non-empty partitions. Furthermore, we establish\nthat the time complexity for building an LHT up to depth $d$ is $O(mnd)$,\ndemonstrating the practical feasibility of constructing trees with powerful\noblique splits using this methodology. The explicit feature weighting at each\nsplit provides inherent interpretability. Experimental results on benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate LHT's competitive accuracy, positioning it as a practical,\ntheoretically grounded, and interpretable alternative in the landscape of\ntree-based models. The implementation of the proposed method is available at\nhttps://github.com/Hongyi-Li-sz/LHT_model.",

Such states are referred to\nas Hall crystals. However, compared to those with integer Hall conductivities,\nthe FQAH crystal (FQAHC) is still elusive even at the level of microscopic\nmodel. In this work, we numerically study a topological flat-band model on\ntriangular lattice with spinless fermions. At fractional filling of the Chern\nband, the nearest-neighbor interaction leads to a commensurate and\ntopologically trivial CDW state. Interestingly, the folded mini-band above the\nCDW gap is non-trivial, and we focus on the doping of it without any\nprojection. A series of (F)QAHC states at (fractional) integer fillings of this\nmini-band are discovered and some FQAHC state might even exist in less \"ideal\"\nconditions. The ground-state degeneracies of such (F)QAHC states are enlarged\nby the CDW degeneracy and the Hall conductivities -- determined by the fillings\nof the mini-band -- are different from the fillings of the original Chern band.\nWe also study the thermodynamics of an FQAHC state and find a compressible CDW\nphase at intermediate temperatures, which might serve as a precursor of lower\ntemperature FQAHC phase. Moreover, we numerically demonstrate that such a\ngeneric scheme of doping CDW-folded topological mini-band could be applied to\nbosonic systems, broadening the platforms of Hall-crystal physics and\nmotivating its exploration in quantum moire and cold-atom systems.",

In this study, we investigate\ntheir structural differences using both photometric and kinematic approaches to\nassess the extent to which photometric decomposition may misidentify key\ncomponents, particularly the stellar halo. We select 270 Sombrero-like galaxies\nat redshift z=0 from the TNG50 simulation, applying filters to include only\nthose with stellar mass $M_{\\ast} > 10^{10}M_{\\odot}$ and stellar halo mass\nfraction $0.3 < f_{\\rm halo} < 0.6$.

We then compare these results\nwith kinematic decomposition based on the auto-GMM method, focusing on\ndifferences in recovered structural parameters such as mass fractions and\nS'ersic indices.Sombrero-like galaxies typically consist of disks embedded in\nmassive stellar halos and may account for 30-60% of galaxies in TNG50. However,\ntheir identification is complicated by structural degeneracies and the presence\nof disk features (e.g., bars, spirals, star formation) at low or moderate\ninclinations. In face-on projections, photometric decomposition systematically\noverestimates disk fractions as stellar halos are almost absent, while edge-on\nanalysis provides only approximate halo fractions. Radial profiles show\ndiscrepancies between photometric and kinematic decomposition, particularly in\ncentral regions. Additionally, no conclusive link exists between the S'ersic\nindex n and the presence of large stellar halos, challenging the use of n as a\nmerger history proxy.

Yet\naccessibility refers not only to making legal documents available to the\npublic, but also rendering legal information comprehensible to them. A vexing\nproblem in bringing legal information to the public is how to turn formal legal\ndocuments such as legislation and judgments, which are often highly technical,\nto easily navigable and comprehensible knowledge to those without legal\neducation. In this study, we formulate a three-step approach for bringing legal\nknowledge to laypersons, tackling the issues of navigability and\ncomprehensibility. First, we translate selected sections of the law into\nsnippets (called CLIC-pages), each being a small piece of article that focuses\non explaining certain technical legal concept in layperson's terms. Second, we\nconstruct a Legal Question Bank (LQB), which is a collection of legal questions\nwhose answers can be found in the CLIC-pages. Third, we design an interactive\nCLIC Recommender (CRec). Given a user's verbal description of a legal situation\nthat requires a legal solution, CRec interprets the user's input and shortlists\nquestions from the question bank that are most likely relevant to the given\nlegal situation and recommends their corresponding CLIC pages where relevant\nlegal knowledge can be found. In this paper we focus on the technical aspects\nof creating an LQB. We show how large-scale pre-trained language models, such\nas GPT-3, can be used to generate legal questions. We compare machine-generated\nquestions (MGQs) against human-composed questions (HCQs) and find that MGQs are\nmore scalable, cost-effective, and more diversified, while HCQs are more\nprecise.

Experimental results\nshowed that Elasticsearch proved to be the most robust retriever among all. The\nfindings also indicate that fine-tuning language models on an NBCC-specific\ndataset can enhance their ability to generate contextually relevant responses.\nWhen combined with context retrieved by a powerful retriever like\nElasticsearch, this improvement in LLM performance can optimize the RAG system,\nenabling it to better navigate the complexities of the NBCC.",

The key obstacles are: (1) existing\ntext-to-3D approaches typically lift text-to-image models to extract semantics\nvia text encoders, while the text encoder exhibits limited comprehension\nability for long descriptions, leading to deviated cross-attention focus,\nsubsequently wrong attribute binding in generated results. (2) Occluded object\nparts demand a disciplined generation order and explicit part disentanglement.\nThough some works introduce manual efforts to alleviate the above issues, their\nquality is unstable and highly reliant on manual information. To tackle above\nproblems, we propose a automated method Hierarchical-Chain-of-Generation\n(HCoG). It leverages a large language model to decompose the long description\ninto blocks representing different object parts, and orders them from inside\nout according to occlusions, forming a hierarchical chain. Within each block we\nfirst coarsely create components, then precisely bind attributes via\ntarget-region localization and corresponding 3D Gaussian kernel optimization.\nBetween blocks, we introduce Gaussian Extension and Label Elimination to\nseamlessly generate new parts by extending new Gaussian kernels, re-assigning\nsemantic labels, and eliminating unnecessary kernels, ensuring that only\nrelevant parts are added without disrupting previously optimized parts.\nExperiments confirm that HCoG yields structurally coherent, attribute-faithful\n3D objects with complex attributes.

The $\\Lambda \\pi^\\pm$ invariant mass spectra are\napproximately reproduced by the contribution from the $\\Sigma(1385)$, modeled\nas a Breit-Wigner resonance combined with background. However, an additional\ncontribution is required to account for the pronounced enhancement near 1435\nMeV. To describe this structure, two scenarios are considered for the\n$\\Sigma(1435)$: one as a Breit-Wigner resonance with spin-parity $1/2^-$\ndescribed via effective Lagrangians, and the other as a rescattering effect\narising from coupled-channel interactions. Specifically, the channels\n$\\bar{K}^0p$, $\\pi^0\\Sigma^+$, $\\pi^+\\Sigma^0$, $\\pi^+\\Lambda$, and\n$\\eta\\Sigma^+$ are included for the positively charged mode, and $K^-n$,\n$\\pi^0\\Sigma^-$, $\\pi^-\\Sigma^0$, $\\pi^-\\Lambda$, and $\\eta\\Sigma^-$ for the\nnegatively charged mode. The rescattering contributions are evaluated using the\nquasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. Simulated invariant mass\nspectra are generated and fitted to the experimental data. Both the\nBreit-Wigner and rescattering mechanisms provide reasonable descriptions of the\nenhancement near 1435 MeV. The rescattering approach naturally generates a\ncusp-like structure near threshold, which closely resembles the feature\nobserved in the data. Furthermore, the inclusion of the $\\Sigma(1380)$\nresonance with spin-parity $1/2^-$ significantly improves the fit in the\nlow-energy region and further enhances the description near 1435 MeV through\ninterference effects. These results underscore the essential roles of the two\n$\\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ states in accurately describing the invariant mass\ndistributions in the decay $\\Lambda_c \\to \\Lambda \\pi^+ \\pi^+ \\pi^-$.",

    "abstract": "Immersive communications is a key use case for 6G where applications require\nreliable latency-bound media traffic at a certain data rate to deliver an\nacceptable User Experience (UX) or Quality-of-Experience (QoE). The\nQuality-of-Service (QoS) framework of current cellular systems (4G and 5G) and\nprevalent network congestion control algorithms for latency-bound traffic like\nL4S typically target network-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as\ndata rates and latencies. Network capacity is based on the number of users that\nattain these KPIs. However, the UX of an immersive application for a given data\nrate and latency is not the same across users, since it depends on other\nfactors such as the complexity of the media being transmitted and the encoder\nformat. This implies that guarantees on network KPIs do not necessarily\ntranslate to guarantees on the UX.\n  In this paper, we propose a framework in which the communication network can\nprovide guarantees on the UX. The framework requires application servers to\nshare real-time information on UX dependency on data rate to the network, which\nin turn, uses this information to maximize a UX-based network utility function.\nOur framework is motivated by the recent industry trends of increasing\napplication awareness at the network, and pushing application servers towards\nthe edge, allowing for tighter coordination between the servers and the 6G\nsystem. Our simulation results show that the proposed framework substantially\nimproves the UX capacity of the network, which is the number of users above a\ncertain UX threshold, compared to conventional rate control algorithms.",

To address these limitations, this paper leverages\npreference alignment techniques, which enable targeted construction of\nout-of-pretraining-distribution data to enhance performance. We introduce a new\ndataset, named the Intelligibility Preference Speech Dataset (INTP), and extend\nthe Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework to accommodate diverse TTS\narchitectures. After INTP alignment, in addition to intelligibility, we observe\noverall improvements including naturalness, similarity, and audio quality for\nmultiple TTS models across diverse domains. Based on that, we also verify the\nweak-to-strong generalization ability of INTP for more intelligible models such\nas CosyVoice 2 and Ints.

These requirements make generalization to novel\nobjects difficult for which neither 3D models nor multi-view images may be\navailable. To address this, we propose a novel method One2Any that estimates\nthe relative 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) object pose using only a single\nreference-single query RGB-D image, without prior knowledge of its 3D model,\nmulti-view data, or category constraints. We treat object pose estimation as an\nencoding-decoding process, first, we obtain a comprehensive Reference Object\nPose Embedding (ROPE) that encodes an object shape, orientation, and texture\nfrom a single reference view. Using this embedding, a U-Net-based pose decoding\nmodule produces Reference Object Coordinate (ROC) for new views, enabling fast\nand accurate pose estimation. This simple encoding-decoding framework allows\nour model to be trained on any pair-wise pose data, enabling large-scale\ntraining and demonstrating great scalability. Experiments on multiple benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our model generalizes well to novel objects,\nachieving state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness even rivaling methods that\nrequire multi-view or CAD inputs, at a fraction of compute.",

The\n12.5 kHz VLF discharge under various RF powers (13.56 MHz) was analyzed using\noptical photography and current-voltage measurements. Two-dimensional electron\ndensities were derived using optical emission spectroscopy combined with\ncollisional radiation modeling methods. It is found that RF power and very low\nfrequency voltage (VVLF) significantly influence the plasma and its discharge\nmodes within the 200 {\\mu}m pore. Under low VVLF conditions, the plasma is more\nintense within the pore, and the discharge mode is columnar discharge. With\nincreasing RF power, the reciprocal motion of electrons counteracts the local\nenhancement effect of columnar discharge, the discharge transforms into RF\ndischarge, the pore is completely wrapped by the sheath, and the plasma inside\nis gradually quenched. Under high VVLF conditions, the electron density within\nthe pore is low and the discharge mode is filamentary discharge. RF\nintroduction reduces plasma intensity within the pores firstly. As RF power\nincreases, more ion trapping in the pore increases the field strength\ndistortion and enhances the plasma intensity inside the pore, this enhancement\neffects becomes more obvious with increasing RF power. In addition, the above\neffects were observed for all pore widths from 100 um to 1000 um. These\nfindings provide key insights for controlling plasma in pores and offer new\nmethodologies for plasma technology applications.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to be an integral part of\nnext-generation AI-native 6G networks. With the prevalence of AI, researchers\nhave identified numerous use cases of AI in network security. However, there\nare almost nonexistent studies that analyze the suitability of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) in network security. To fill this gap, we examine the suitability\nof LLMs in network security, particularly with the case study of STRIDE threat\nmodeling. We utilize four prompting techniques with five LLMs to perform STRIDE\nclassification of 5G threats. From our evaluation results, we point out key\nfindings and detailed insights along with the explanation of the possible\nunderlying factors influencing the behavior of LLMs in the modeling of certain\nthreats. The numerical results and the insights support the necessity for\nadjusting and fine-tuning LLMs for network security use cases.",

    "abstract": "We provide an analytical framework for analyzing the quality of stochastic\nVerlet-type integrators for simulating the Langevin equation. Focusing only on\nbasic objective measures, we consider the ability of an integrator to correctly\nsimulate characteristic configurational quantities of transport, a) diffusion\non a flat surface and b) drift velocity on a tilted planar surface, as well as\nc) statistical sampling of a harmonic potential. For any stochastic Verlet-type\nintegrator expressed in its configurational form, we develop closed form\nexpressions to directly assess these three most basic quantities as a function\nof the applied time step. The applicability of the analysis is exemplified\nthrough twelve representative integrators developed over the past five decades,\nand algorithm performance is conveniently visualized through the three\ncharacteristic measures for each integrator. The GJ set of integrators stands\nout as the only option for correctly simulating diffusion, drift, and Boltzmann\ndistribution in linear systems, and we therefore suggest that this general\nmethod is best suited for high quality thermodynamic simulations of nonlinear\nand complex systems, including for relatively high time steps compared to\nsimulations with other integrators.",

However, the limited coverage\nof terrestrial networks poses challenges for serving LAVs in remote areas.\nBesides, efficient LAV operations also require support such as localization and\nnavigation, which terrestrial networks designed for communications cannot fully\nprovide. Due to ubiquitous coverage and diverse functions, satellites are a\npromising technology to support LAVs. Therefore, this article investigates\nsatellite-assisted LAE networking. First, we introduce an overview of LAE and\nsatellites, discussing their features, applications, and architectures. Next,\nwe investigate opportunities for satellites to assist LAE from aspects of\ncommunication, control, and computation. As all assistance depends on reliable\nsatellite-LAV communications, we propose a satellite-assisted LAE framework to\ntackle issues caused by the severe path loss and high dynamics in\nsatellite-assisted LAE networks.The case study demonstrates that the\ndistributed MIMO architecture efficiently reduces the required transmission\npower and extends service duration, while the two-timescale optimization scheme\nbalances the performance and control signaling overheads.

A key challenge in performing\nthese tasks lies in achieving efficient and rapid path planning within complex\nenvironments. Sampling-based path planning methods, such as Rapidly-exploring\nRandom Tree* (RRT*), have demonstrated notable performance in high-dimensional\nspaces. In recent years, researchers have begun designing various\ngeometry-inspired heuristics and neural network-driven heuristics to further\nenhance the effectiveness of RRT*. However, the performance of these general\npath planning methods still requires improvement when applied to highly\ncluttered underwater environments. In this paper, we propose PierGuard, which\ncombines the strengths of bidirectional search and neural network-driven\nheuristic regions. We design a specialized neural network to generate\nhigh-quality heuristic regions in cluttered maps, thereby improving the\nperformance of the path planning. Through extensive simulation and real-world\nocean field experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our\nproposed method compared with previous research.

Furthermore, we discover and verify that using the\nupper bound as the loss is more conducive to the selection mechanism, as it can\neffectively filter out harmful samples that confuse the model. Combining these\ntwo key advantages, the proposed efficient loss and a complementary selection\nstrategy can simultaneously boost the potential of reliable samples and meet\nthe stringent time requirements of TTA. The comprehensive experiments on\nvarious network architectures across challenging testing scenarios demonstrate\nimpressive performances and the broad adaptability of SEVA. The code will be\npublicly available.",

    "abstract": "We propose a method to probe the thermal properties of quantum field theory\n(QFT) in an inflationary universe simulated by spin systems. Our previous work\n(arXiv:2410.07587) has demonstrated that QFT of Majorana fermions in an\narbitrary two-dimensional spacetime can be mapped onto a spin system. In this\nstudy, we apply this mapping to investigate the thermal properties of an\ninflationary universe. An interaction between a quantum field and a detector\nallows one to extract information about the quantum field from the excitation\nprobability of the detector, known as the Unruh-DeWitt detector. In an\ninflationary universe with Hubble constant $H$, the excitation probability of\nan Unruh-DeWitt detector follows a thermal distribution with temperature\n$H/(2\\pi)$, indicating that a static observer in the inflationary universe\nperceives a thermal field. We consider a spin system corresponding to QFT in an\ninflationary universe and introduce a single spin interacting with this system\nas an Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the detector response\nasymptotically approaches the result of QFT with an appropriate power of the\nnumber of spin sites. Since the dynamics of spin systems can be implemented on\nprogrammable quantum simulation platforms, our study offers a concrete route\ntoward experimentally probing the thermal properties of an inflationary\nuniverse in controlled quantum settings. This highlights the potential of\nquantum technologies to emulate and investigate aspects of quantum field theory\nin curved spacetimes.",

This process is critical for mitigating texture\ndistortion and ensuring the camouflage's effectiveness when applied in the real\nworld.

In this paper, we investigated novel and modified\nactivation functions aimed at mitigating aliasing within neural amplifier\nmodels.

    "abstract": "This study explores how emotions and sentiments differ in customer reviews of\nproducts and services on e-commerce platforms. Unlike earlier research that\ntreats all reviews uniformly, this study distinguishes between reviews of\nproducts, typically fulfilling basic, functional needs, and services, which\noften cater to experiential and emotional desires. The findings reveal clear\ndifferences in emotional expression and sentiment between the two. Product\nreviews frequently focus on practicality, such as functionality, reliability,\nand value for money, and are generally more neutral or pragmatic in tone. In\ncontrast, service reviews involve stronger emotional engagement, as services\noften entail personal interactions and subjective experiences. Customers\nexpress a broader spectrum of emotions, such as joy, frustration, or\ndisappointment when reviewing services, as identified using advanced machine\nlearning techniques. Cultural background further influences these patterns.\nConsumers from collectivist cultures, as defined by Hofstede cultural\ndimensions, often use more moderated and socially considerate language,\nreflecting an emphasis on group harmony. Conversely, consumers from\nindividualist cultures tend to offer more direct, emotionally intense feedback.\nNotably, gender appears to have minimal impact on sentiment variation,\nreinforcing the idea that the nature of the offering (product vs. service) and\ncultural context are the dominant factors. Theoretically, the study extends\nMaslow hierarchy of needs and Hofstede cultural framework to the domain of\nonline reviews, proposing a model that explains how these dimensions shape\nconsumer expression. Practically, the insights offer valuable guidance for\nbusinesses looking to optimize their marketing and customer engagement\nstrategies by aligning messaging and service design with customer expectations\nacross product types and cultural backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "Modern applications commonly leverage large, multi-modal foundation models.\nThese applications often feature complex workflows that demand the storage and\nusage of similar models in multiple precisions. A straightforward approach is\nto maintain a separate file for each model precision (e.g., INT8, BF16), which\nis indeed the approach taken by many model providers such as HuggingFace and\nOllama. However, this approach incurs excessive storage costs since a higher\nprecision model (e.g., BF16) is a strict superset of a lower precision model\n(e.g., INT8) in terms of information. Unfortunately, simply maintaining only\nthe higher-precision model and requiring every user to dynamically convert the\nmodel precision is not desirable because every user of lower precision models\nmust pay the cost for model download and precision conversion.\n  In this paper, we present QStore, a unified, lossless compression format for\nsimultaneously storing a model in two (high and low) precisions efficiently.\nInstead of storing low-precision and high-precision models separately, QStore\nstores low-precision model and only the residual information needed to\nreconstruct high-precision models. The size of residual information is\nsignificantly smaller than the original high-precision models, thus achieving\nhigh savings in storage cost. Moreover, QStore does not compromise the speed of\nmodel loading. The low-precision models can be loaded quickly just like before.\nThe high-precision models can also be reconstructed efficiently in memory by\nmerging low-precision data and the residual with QStore's lightweight decoding\nlogic. We evaluate QStore for compressing multiple precisions of popular\nfoundation models, and show that QStore reduces overall storage footprint by up\nto 2.2x (45% of the original size) while enabling up to 1.7x and 1.8x faster\nmodel saving and loading versus existing approaches.",

We propose a novel framework distinguishing\ncompute-dependent innovations--which yield disproportionate benefits at high\ncompute--from compute-independent innovations, which improve efficiency across\ncompute scales. The impact is quantified using Compute-Equivalent Gain (CEG).\nExperimental validation with nanoGPT models confirms that compute-independent\nadvancements yield significant performance gains (e.g., with combined CEG up to\n$3.5\\times$) across the tested scales. In contrast, compute-dependent\nadvancements were detrimental to performance at smaller experimental scales,\nbut showed improved CEG (on par with the baseline) as model size increased, a\ntrend consistent with their definition of yielding primary benefits at higher\ncompute. Crucially, these findings indicate that restrictions on computational\nhardware, while potentially slowing LLM progress, are insufficient to prevent\nall capability gains driven by algorithmic advancements. We argue that\neffective AI oversight must therefore incorporate mechanisms for understanding,\nanticipating, and potentially guiding algorithmic research, moving beyond a\nsingular focus on hardware.

The dominant\nframework, optimal fingerprinting, is a linear errors-in-variables model in\nwhich each covariate is subject to measurement error with covariance\nproportional to that of the regression error. The reliability of such analyses\ndepends critically on accurate inference of the regression coefficients. The\noptimal weight matrix for estimating these coefficients is the precision matrix\nof the regression error, which is typically unknown and must be estimated from\nclimate model simulations. However, existing regularized optimal fingerprinting\napproaches often yield underestimated uncertainties and overly narrow\nconfidence intervals that fail to attain nominal coverage, thereby compromising\nthe reliability of analysis. In this paper, we first propose consistent\nvariance estimators for the regression coefficients within the class of linear\nshrinkage weight matrices, addressing undercoverage in conventional methods.\nBuilding on this, we derive a linearly optimal weight matrix that directly\nminimizes the asymptotic variances of the estimated scaling factors.

Focusing on log-linear\nmodels, we sample from high-dimensional lattice fibers defined by algebraic\nconstraints. Building on Markov basis methods and results from Diaconis and\nSturmfels, our algorithm uses variable step sizes to accelerate exploration and\nreduce the need for long burn-in. We introduce a novel Fiber Coverage Score\n(FCS) based on Voronoi partitioning to assess sample quality, and highlight the\nutility of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) quality metric. Simulations on\nbenchmark fibers show that multilevel sampling outperforms naive MCMC\napproaches.

    "abstract": "Traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) have attracted much attention\nfor their broadband amplification and near-quantum-limited noise performance.\nTWPAs are non-reciprocal by nature providing gain for forward-propagating\nsignals and transmission line losses for backward traveling waves. This\nintrinsic non-reciprocity is insufficient to protect sensitive quantum devices\nfrom back-action due to noise from warmer amplification stages in practical\nsystems, and thus necessitates the need for bulky cryogenic isolators. We\npresent a multi-stage Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier (mTWPA) that\naddresses this limitation by achieving passive in-band reverse isolation\nalongside near-quantum-limited noise performance. The multi-stage architecture\nconsists of two, mode conversion stages and a reflectionless high-pass filter\nwhich provides the passive isolation. Experimental measurements of a prototype\nmTWPA demonstrated 20 dB of forward gain across a 1.6 GHz bandwidth and greater\nthan 35 dB of reverse isolation. Noise measurements indicate performance at 1.7\ntimes the quantum limit. This demonstrates that the increased complexity of a\nmulti-stage TWPA design does not lead to significant added noise. The designed\ndistribution of gain across the stages is engineered to minimize internal\namplifier noise at the input, and we propose further optimization strategies in\nredistribution of the gain between the stages. This level of isolation\neffectively mitigates noise from warmer amplification stages, matching the\nperformance of conventional isolators.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an algorithmic framework for the minimization of strictly\nconvex quadratic functions. The framework is flexible and generic. At every\niteration the search direction is a linear combination of the negative\ngradient, as well as (possibly) several other `sub-search' directions, where\nthe user determines which, and how many, sub-search directions to include.\nThen, a step size along each sub-direction is generated in such a way that the\ngradient is minimized (with respect to a matrix norm), over the hyperplane\nspecified by the user chosen search directions. Theoretical machinery is\ndeveloped, which shows that any algorithm that fits into the generic framework\nis guaranteed to converge at a linear rate. Moreover, these theoretical results\nhold even when relaxation and/or symmetric preconditioning is employed. Several\nstate-of-the-art algorithms fit into this scheme, including steepest descent\nand conjugate gradients.",

    "abstract": "Trustworthy multi-view learning has attracted extensive attention because\nevidence learning can provide reliable uncertainty estimation to enhance the\ncredibility of multi-view predictions. Existing trusted multi-view learning\nmethods implicitly assume that multi-view data is secure. However, in\nsafety-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and security\nmonitoring, multi-view data often faces threats from adversarial perturbations,\nthereby deceiving or disrupting multi-view models. This inevitably leads to the\nadversarial unreliability problem (AUP) in trusted multi-view learning. To\novercome this tricky problem, we propose a novel multi-view learning framework,\nnamely Reliable Disentanglement Multi-view Learning (RDML). Specifically, we\nfirst propose evidential disentanglement learning to decompose each view into\nclean and adversarial parts under the guidance of corresponding evidences,\nwhich is extracted by a pretrained evidence extractor. Then, we employ the\nfeature recalibration module to mitigate the negative impact of adversarial\nperturbations and extract potential informative features from them. Finally, to\nfurther ignore the irreparable adversarial interferences, a view-level\nevidential attention mechanism is designed. Extensive experiments on multi-view\nclassification tasks with adversarial attacks show that RDML outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods by a relatively large margin.

Electro-optic characterization of\nthe spalled films yields a Pockels coefficient of r33 = 55 pm/V in multi-domain\nregions and 160 pm/V in single-domain regions, leading to projections up to\n1980 pm/V for r42 under conditions of unclamped excitation.

This object displays a remarkable circular\nsymmetry in shape, making it one of the most circular Galactic SNRs known.\nNicknamed Teleios due to its symmetry, it was detected in the new Australian\nSquare Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe\n(EMU) radio-continuum images with an angular size of 1320\"x1260\" and PA = 0\ndeg. While there is a hint of possible H$\\alpha$ and gamma-ray emission,\nTeleios is exclusively seen at radio-continuum frequencies. Interestingly,\nTeleios is not only almost perfectly symmetric, but it also has one of the\nlowest surface brightnesses discovered among Galactic SNRs and a steep spectral\nindex of $\\alpha=-0.6\\pm 0.3$. Our estimates from HI studies and the Sigma-D\nrelation place Teleios as a type Ia SNR at a distance of either ~2.2 kpc of\n~7.7 kpc. This indicates two possible scenarios, either a young (under 1000 yr)\nor an older SNR (over 10000 yr). With a corresponding diameter of 14/48 pc, our\nevolutionary studies place Teleios at the either early or late Sedov phase,\ndepending on the distance estimate. However, our modelling also predicts X-ray\nemission, which we do not see in the present generation of eROSITA images. We\nalso explored a type Iax explosion scenario that points to a much closer\ndistance of <1 kpc and Teleios size of only ~3.3 pc, which would be similar to\nthe only known type Iax remnant SN1181. Unfortunately, all examined scenarios\nhave their challenges, and no definitive supernova (SN) origin type can be\nestablished at this stage. Teleios's symmetrical shape suggests expansion into\na rarefied and isotropic ambient medium. The low radio surface brightness and\nthe lack of pronounced polarisation can be explained by a high level of ambient\nrotation measure (RM), with the largest RM being observed at centre.",

LN2\ndroplets clearly illustrate the rotating ponderomotive-like force, producing\ntrajectories closely consistent with theoretical predictions. Using\nexperimental data, we compare the stability threshold and particle trajectories\nof LN2 droplets and traditional ball bearings. LN2 droplets exhibit a sharply\ndefined and visually distinct stability threshold, transitioning abruptly from\nunstable to stable motion at a critical rotation frequency. In contrast, ball\nbearings demonstrate a more gradual threshold, accompanied by trajectories\ncomplicated by friction-induced deviations. We present detailed measurements of\nparticle lifetimes and trajectories as functions of dimensionless stability\nparameters for both symmetric and intentionally asymmetric saddles. These\nimprovements significantly enhance visual and conceptual clarity, reduce common\nmisconceptions related to frictional dynamics, and provide natural\nopportunities for exploring related phenomena such as the Leidenfrost effect.\nWe also offer practical guidance on assembling and implementing this enhanced\ndemonstration for effective classroom and laboratory instruction.",

    "abstract": "Excessive wealth concentration can undermine economic and social development.\nRandom Asset Exchange (RAE) models provide valuable tools to investigate this\nphenomenon. Assuming that economic systems may operate optimally near the\ncritical point of a continuous phase transition, the Extended Yard Sale (EYS)\nmodel introduced by Boghosian et al.~[Physica A 476, 15 (2017)] offers a\ncompelling framework. This model captures the interplay between wealth\nredistribution and accumulation, exhibiting a continuous phase transition\nmarked by a broad wealth distribution at criticality, separating a condensed\nphase -- where a microscopic fraction of agents holds a macroscopic share of\ntotal wealth -- from a distributed phase with a light-tailed wealth\ndistribution. While the original EYS model assumes fully connected\ninteractions, this work introduces and studies a networked variant where agents\ninteract over Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random networks. The analysis combines Monte\nCarlo simulations with Quenched Mean Field and Mean Field approximations,\nexploring a variety of interaction and taxation schemes. A scaling analysis\nshows that, although the networked model also undergoes a continuous phase\ntransition, it leads to local wealth condensation rather than the global\ncondensation found in the fully connected case. These results deepen our\nunderstanding of wealth dynamics in structured populations and may help inform\nthe development of more effective economic and social policies.",

    "abstract": "We investigate how to reliably remove unwanted global phase windings in\ngain-based optical oscillator networks, thereby ensuring convergence to the\ntrue synchronized configuration corresponding to the XY Hamiltonian's global\nminimum. Focusing on one-dimensional rings and two-dimensional toroidal\nlattices, we show that two key strategies greatly enhance the probability of\nreaching the defect-free state. First, operating at a low effective injection\nrate just above threshold, exploits the amplitude degree of freedom, allowing\nthe system to form transient zero-amplitude holes: instantons in one dimension,\nor vortex-antivortex rarefaction pulses in two-dimensional space, that enable\nphase slips. Second, preparing the initial condition with amplitude or phase\ninhomogeneities can directly seed these amplitude collapses and prevent the\nsystem from getting trapped in higher-energy states with nonzero winding. Using\nthe Stuart--Landau and Ginzburg--Landau equations as models for fast-reservoir\nlasers, we derive analytic and numerical evidence that even relatively minor\namplitude dips can trigger global unwinding in 1D. We further demonstrate that\nthe pump's slow annealing favours these amplitude-driven events, leading to\nimproved success in finding the globally coherent ground state. These findings\nhighlight the critical role of amplitude freedom in analogue solvers for XY\noptimization problems, showing how local amplitude suppression provides a\ndirect route to ejecting topological defects.",

    "abstract": "High 1/f noise in CryoCMOS devices is a critical parameter to keep under\ncontrol in the design of complex circuits for low temperatures applications.\nCurrent models predict the 1/f noise to scale linearly with temperature, and\ngate oxide defects are expected to freeze out at cryogenic temperatures.\nNevertheless, it has been repeatedly observed that 1/f noise deviates from the\npredicted behaviour and that gate oxide defects are still active around 4.2 K,\nproducing random telegraph noise. In this paper, we probe single gate oxide\ndefects in 2500 nMOS devices down to 5 K in order to investigate the origin of\n1/f noise in CryoCMOS devices. From our results, it is clear that the number of\ndefects active at cryogenic temperatures resulting in random telegraph noise is\nlarger than at 300 K. Threshold voltage shifts due to charged defects are shown\nto be exponentially distributed, with different modalities across temperatures\nand biases: from monomodal at 300 K to trimodal below 100 K. The third mode is\ninterpreted in the framework of percolation theory. By fitting these\ndistributions, it is shown that more than 80% of the detected defects belongs\nto the oxide bulk. Afterwards, starting from the raw data in time domain, we\nreconstruct the low frequency noise spectra, highlighting the contributions of\ndefects belonging to different branches and, therefore, to different oxide\nlayers. This analysis shows that, although interface traps and large defects\nassociated with the third mode are the main sources of 1/f noise at 5 K, bulk\noxide defects still contribute significantly to low-frequency noise at\ncryogenic temperatures. Finally, we show that defect time constants and step\nheights are uncorrelated, proving that elastic tunnelling model for charge\ntrapping is not accurate.",

The orbital periods of all the six targets are\nlonger than 0.5d, and we discovered that their mass ratios are smaller than\n0.15. So, they are extremely low mass-ratio contact binaries. Only one target\nis a W-subtype contact binary (ASASSN-V J105032.88+420829.0), while the others\nare A-subtype contact binaries. From orbital period analysis, ASASSN-V\nJ075442.44+555623.2 shows no orbital period change. Three of the six targets\ndemonstrate a secular period increase, and two targets for a secular period\ndecrease. We investigated the LAMOST spectra employing the spectral subtraction\nmethod. All six contact binaries show no chromospheric emission line, implying\nno chromospheric activity. Their absolute parameters, initial masses, ages,\nenergy transfer parameters, and instability parameters were calculated. The\nbolometric luminosity ratios ($(L_2/L_1)_{bol}$), the energy transfer\nparameters ($\\beta$), the contact degrees ($f$), and the mass ratios ($q$) were\ncollected for a sample of 218 contact binaries and we analyzed and discussed\nsome correlations. The results by analyzing the relation between $\\beta$, $f$\nand $q$ indicate that the energy transfer parameter between the two components\nof extremely low mass-ratio contact binaries is independent of the contact\ndegree. And the predicted cutoff mass ratio was estimated as 0.021 by analyzing\nthe relation between $f$ and $q$.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce MeshGen, an advanced image-to-3D pipeline that\ngenerates high-quality 3D meshes with detailed geometry and physically based\nrendering (PBR) textures. Addressing the challenges faced by existing 3D native\ndiffusion models, such as suboptimal auto-encoder performance, limited\ncontrollability, poor generalization, and inconsistent image-based PBR\ntexturing, MeshGen employs several key innovations to overcome these\nlimitations. We pioneer a render-enhanced point-to-shape auto-encoder that\ncompresses meshes into a compact latent space by designing perceptual\noptimization with ray-based regularization. This ensures that the 3D shapes are\naccurately represented and reconstructed to preserve geometric details within\nthe latent space. To address data scarcity and image-shape misalignment, we\nfurther propose geometric augmentation and generative rendering augmentation\ntechniques, which enhance the model's controllability and generalization\nability, allowing it to perform well even with limited public datasets. For the\ntexture generation, MeshGen employs a reference attention-based multi-view\nControlNet for consistent appearance synthesis. This is further complemented by\nour multi-view PBR decomposer that estimates PBR components and a UV inpainter\nthat fills invisible areas, ensuring a seamless and consistent texture across\nthe 3D mesh. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MeshGen largely\noutperforms previous methods in both shape and texture generation, setting a\nnew standard for the quality of 3D meshes generated with PBR textures.

Aims: This study investigates\nthe impact of scheduled deadlines on TD. It analyzes how scheduled deadlines\naffect code quality, commit activities, and issues in issue-tracking systems.\nMethod: We analyzed eight Open Source Software (OSS) projects with regular\nrelease schedules using SonarQube.

The study combined quantitative metrics with\nqualitative analyses to comprehensively understand TD accumulation under\nscheduled deadlines. Results: Our findings indicated that some projects had a\nclear increase in TD as deadlines approached (with above 50% of releases having\nincreasing TD accumulation as deadlines approached), while others managed to\nmaintain roughly the same amount of TD. Analysis of commit activities and issue\ntracking revealed that deadline proximity could lead to increased commit\nfrequency and bug-related issue creation.

We focus on the role\nof defects, heterogeneous elasticity, and damping in model amorphous solids\nwithout defects. We review our definition of damping defects and show that they\nstrongly influence sound damping. However, we also find another contribution to\nsound damping that cannot be attributed to damping defects. We confirm an\nearlier result of Kapteijns et al. [G. Kapteijns et al., J. Chem.
