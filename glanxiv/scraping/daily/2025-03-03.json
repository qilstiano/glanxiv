Researchers and educators have created several games that\nincrease media literacy and resilience to misinformation. However, the existing\nbody of misinformation education games rarely focus upon the socio-emotional\ninfluences that factor into misinformation belief. Misinformation correction\nand serious games have both explored narrative as a method to engage with\npeople on an emotional basis. To this end, we investigated how 123 young adults\n(mean age = 22.98) experienced narrative transportation and identification in\ntwo narrative-centered misinformation escape room games developed for library\nsettings. We found that propensity for certain misinformation contexts, such as\nengagement with fan culture and likelihood to share on social media platforms,\nsignificantly affected how participants experienced specific measures of\nnarrative immersion within the games.

Two primary approaches to ensure privacy preservation in\nVideo HAR are differential privacy (DP) and visual privacy. Techniques\nenforcing DP during training provide strong theoretical privacy guarantees but\noffer limited capabilities for visual privacy assessment. Conversely methods,\nsuch as low-resolution transformations, data obfuscation and adversarial\nnetworks, emphasize visual privacy but lack clear theoretical privacy\nassurances. In this work, we focus on two main objectives: (1) leveraging DP\nproperties to develop a model-free approach for visual privacy in videos and\n(2) evaluating our proposed technique using both differential privacy and\nvisual privacy assessments on HAR tasks. To achieve goal (1), we introduce\nVideo-DPRP: a Video-sample-wise Differentially Private Random Projection\nframework for privacy-preserved video reconstruction for HAR. By using random\nprojections, noise matrices and right singular vectors derived from the\nsingular value decomposition of videos, Video-DPRP reconstructs DP videos using\nprivacy parameters ($\\epsilon,\\delta$) while enabling visual privacy\nassessment. For goal (2), using UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets, we compare\nVideo-DPRP's performance on activity recognition with traditional DP methods,\nand state-of-the-art (SOTA) visual privacy-preserving techniques. Additionally,\nwe assess its effectiveness in preserving privacy-related attributes such as\nfacial features, gender, and skin color, using the PA-HMDB and VISPR datasets.\nVideo-DPRP combines privacy-preservation from both a DP and visual privacy\nperspective unlike SOTA methods that typically address only one of these\naspects.",

In particular, it doens't require the boundness of loss\nfunction, as commonly assumed in the literature. Our theory goes beyond the\nbias-variance tradeoff, aligned with phenomenon typically encountered in deep\nlearning. It is therefore sharp different with other existing nonasymptotic\ngeneralization error bounds for neural networks.

A\nfeature of our theory is that it also considers approximation errors.\nFurthermore, we show the near minimax optimality of our theory for multilayer\nReLU networks for regression problems.

To enable\nthe diffusion model to learn spatial information to improve the quality of the\nhands generated, we propose HanDrawer, a module to condition the hand\ngeneration process. Specifically, we apply graph convolutional layers to\nextract the endogenous spatial structure and physical constraints implicit in\nMANO hand mesh vertices. We then align and fuse these spatial features with\nother modalities via cross-attention. The spatially fused features are used to\nguide a single stage diffusion model denoising process for high quality\ngeneration of the hand region. To improve the accuracy of spatial feature\nfusion, we propose a Position-Preserving Zero Padding (PPZP) fusion strategy,\nwhich ensures that the features extracted by HanDrawer are fused into the\nregion of interest in the relevant layers of the diffusion model. HanDrawer\nlearns the entire image features while paying special attention to the hand\nregion thanks to an additional hand reconstruction loss combined with the\ndenoising loss. To accurately train and evaluate our approach, we perform\ncareful cleansing and relabeling of the widely used HaGRID hand gesture dataset\nand obtain high quality multimodal data.

Additionally, we\npresent a command-line interface (CLI) tool that enables users to generate\ndatasets using the same methodology, allowing for tailored assessments of LLMs.\nTMIQ and the CLI tool provide a rigorous, reproducible means of evaluating LLMs\nfor production environments, facilitating continuous monitoring and identifying\nstrengths and areas for improvement, and driving innovation in their selections\nfor applications within the Test and Measurement industry.",

First, we\nlet the projective general linear group $PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ act on $q$-real\nnumbers via a $q$-deformed action. The quantized matrices we get have\ncombinatorial interpretations. Then we consider an extension of the group\n$PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ by the $2$-elements cyclic group, and define a quantized\naction of this extension on $q$-real numbers. We deduce from these actions some\nunderlying relations between $q$-real numbers, and between left and right\nversions of $q$-deformed rational numbers. In particular we investigate the\ncase of some algebraic numbers of degree $4$ and $6$. We also prove that the\nway of quantizing real numbers defined by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko is an\ninjective process.",

Such systems are bright in X-rays, and the most luminous among\nthem are called ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). In this paper, we address\nthe enigmatic NGC 300 ULX-1. It's X-ray activity started in 2010 with the\nsupernova impostor-like event SN 2010da. In the following few years the ULX was\npowered by persistent super-Eddington accretion but then it dimmed in X-rays.\nWe present the most recent X-ray and optical observations. The Chandra and\nSwift telescopes confirm that SN 2010da/NGC 300 ULX-1 is not accreting at\nsuper-Eddington level anymore. We attribute this switch in accretion regime to\nthe donor star variability and its fast evolution. In order to gain a better\nunderstanding of the donor star's nature, we consider its optical light curve\non a decade-long time scale and show that the optical counterpart of SN\n2010da/NGC 300 ULX-1 dimmed significantly over recent years. The most recent\ndetection in optical by the Gemini telescope reveals that the source is now >\n2.5 mag fainter in the r' band compared to the epoch when it was\nspectroscopically classified as a red supergiant. We discuss the nature of the\nabrupt changes in the donor star properties, and consider among other\npossibilities the silent collapse of the donor star into a black hole.",

Popular examples of anomalous\ngeneralization behaviour include benign overfitting, double descent, and the\nsuccess of overparametrization. We argue that these phenomena are not distinct\nto neural networks, or particularly mysterious. Moreover, this generalization\nbehaviour can be intuitively understood, and rigorously characterized, using\nlong-standing generalization frameworks such as PAC-Bayes and countable\nhypothesis bounds. We present soft inductive biases as a key unifying principle\nin explaining these phenomena: rather than restricting the hypothesis space to\navoid overfitting, embrace a flexible hypothesis space, with a soft preference\nfor simpler solutions that are consistent with the data. This principle can be\nencoded in many model classes, and thus deep learning is not as mysterious or\ndifferent from other model classes as it might seem. However, we also highlight\nhow deep learning is relatively distinct in other ways, such as its ability for\nrepresentation learning, phenomena such as mode connectivity, and its relative\nuniversality.",

The challenge of finding\nanomalies can be confounding since it requires codifying a complete knowledge\nof the known scientific behaviors and then projecting these known behaviors on\nthe data to look for deviations. When utilizing machine learning, this presents\na particular challenge since we require that the model not only understands\nscientific data perfectly but also recognizes when the data is inconsistent and\nout of the scope of its trained behavior.

Balancing the accuracy of localization with computational\nefficiency remains a significant challenge, as high-accuracy methods often come\nwith higher computational costs. In this paper, we present two ways of\nimproving lidar localization efficiency and study their impact on performance.\nFirst, we integrate a lightweight Doppler-based odometry method into a\ntopometric localization pipeline and compare its performance against an\niterative closest point (ICP)-based method. We highlight the trade-offs between\nthese approaches: the Doppler estimator offers faster, lightweight updates,\nwhile ICP provides higher accuracy at the cost of increased computational load.\nSecond, by controlling the frequency of localization updates and leveraging\nodometry estimates between them, we demonstrate that accurate localization can\nbe maintained while optimizing for computational efficiency using either\nodometry method. Our experimental results show that localizing every 10 lidar\nframes strikes a favourable balance, achieving a localization accuracy below\n0.05 meters in translation and below 0.1 degrees in orientation while reducing\ncomputational effort by over 30% in an ICP-based pipeline.

Its primary\nscience goal is to image the surfaces and interiors of stars with unprecedented\ndetail, revealing new details about their magnetic processes and dynamic\nevolution and enabling the creation of a truly predictive solar/stellar dynamo\nmodel. This capability will transform our understanding of stellar physics and\nhas broad applicability across astrophysics, from resolving the cores of Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN) to studying supernovae, planetary nebulae, and the late\nstages of stellar evolution. By leveraging the stable vacuum environment of the\nMoon and the infrastructure being established for the Artemis Program, AeSI\npresents a compelling case for a lunar-based interferometer. In this study, the\nAeSI Team, working with the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Integrated\nDesign Center (IDC), has firmly established the feasibility of building and\noperating a reconfigurable, dispersed aperture telescope (i.e., an\ninterferometer) on the lunar surface. The collaboration produced a credible\nBaseline design featuring 15 primary mirrors arranged in an elliptical array\nwith a 1 km major axis, with the potential to expand to 30 mirrors and larger\narray sizes through staged deployments. Additionally, this study identified\nnumerous opportunities for optimization and the necessary trade studies to\nrefine the design further.

In particular, our analysis reveals that even when LMs show\nimproved in-domain (ID) reasoning accuracy, they actually compromise their\ngeneralized reasoning capabilities on out-of-domain (OOD) tasks due to\nmemorization rather than genuine. Through a systematic investigation of LM\narchitecture, we discover that during self-improvement, LM weight updates are\nconcentrated in less reasoning-critical layers, leading to superficial\nlearning.

The characteristics of the\nbroadband transformer may then be understood using results for the previously\nstudied 2-plate system and asymptotic approximations using the small\nair-to-water impedance ratio. Optimal systems with water and air-side plates of\nsimilar material have relative thicknesses of approximately three to one,\nrespectively, with the central mass having areal density approximately 17 times\nthe water side plate. Further identities relate the frequency of total\ntransmission to the plate thicknesses and to the rib separation length. The\nimpedance transformer is compared to an ideal two layer quarter wavelength\nmodel, allowing us to identify a minimal attainable Q-factor of about 5.5,\nwhich is achieved in examples presented. The formulas for approximately\noptimized parameters also serve as the initial population for numerical\noptimization, greatly accelerating the process. Together, the theoretical and\nnumerical results point to a remarkably simple class of purely solid impedance\ntransformers, with system parameters well defined by the asymptotically small\nparameter: the ratio of air-to-water acoustic impedances.",

In\ncontrast with existing work that has only considered systems with dynamically\ndecoupled agents, we consider a dynamically coupled system composed of\ninterconnected subsystems subject to local communication constraints. In\nparticular, we propose a distributed algorithm to compute the localized optimal\nfeedback control policy for each individual subsystem, which depends only on\nthe local state histories of its neighboring subsystems. Utilizing the\nsystem-level synthesis (SLS) framework, we first recast the localized\ncovariance steering problem as a convex SLS problem with locality constraints.\nSubsequently, exploiting its partially separable structure, we decompose the\nlatter problem into smaller subproblems, introducing a transformation to deal\nwith nonseparable instances. Finally, we employ a variation of the consensus\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to distribute computation\nacross subsystems on account of their local information and communication\nconstraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm on a\npower system with 36 interconnected subsystems.",

Although many tools and research prototypes\nhave been developed to help programmers generate these notices by analyzing the\nsource code, these approaches are often fairly coarse-grained (i.e., at the\nlevel of whole methods or files, rather than at the statement level). But this\nis not necessarily how privacy behaviors exist in code. Privacy behaviors are\nembedded in specific statements in code. Current literature does not examine\nwhat statements programmers see as most important, how consistent these views\nare, or how to detect them. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to\nexamine which statements programmers view as most-related to privacy behaviors.\nWe find that expression statements that make function calls are most associated\nwith privacy behaviors, while the type of privacy label has little effect on\nthe attributes of the selected statements. We then propose an approach to\nautomatically detect these privacy-relevant statements by fine-tuning three\nlarge language models with the data from the study.

While\nmany model developers release estimates of the power consumption and carbon\nemissions from the final training runs for their latest models, there is\ncomparatively little transparency into the impact of model development,\nhardware manufacturing, and total water usage throughout. In this work, we\nestimate the real-world environmental impact of developing a series of language\nmodels, ranging from 20 million to 13 billion active parameters, trained on up\nto 5.6 trillion tokens each. When accounting for hardware manufacturing, model\ndevelopment, and our final training runs, we find that our series of models\nreleased 493 metric tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to powering about 98\nhomes in the United States for one year, and consumed 2.769 million liters of\nwater, equivalent to about 24.5 years of water usage by a person in the United\nStates, even though our data center is extremely water-efficient. We measure\nand report the environmental impact of our model development; to the best of\nour knowledge we are the first to do so for LLMs, and we find that model\ndevelopment, the impact of which is generally not disclosed by most model\ndevelopers, amounted to ~50% of that of training.

We first observe a strong\nimpossibility: without appropriate knowledge about the valuation functions of\nthe incoming agents, no online algorithm can ensure any non-trivial MMS\napproximation, even when there are only two agents. Motivated by this\nimpossibility, we introduce OnlineKTypeFD (online $k$-type fair division), a\nmodel that balances theoretical tractability with real-world applicability. In\nthis model, each arriving agent belongs to one of $k$ types, with all agents of\na given type sharing the same known valuation function. We do not constrain $k$\nto be a constant. Upon arrival, an agent reveals her type, receives an\nirrevocable allocation, and departs. We study the ex-post MMS guarantees of\nonline algorithms under two arrival models:\n  1- Adversarial arrivals: In this model, an adversary determines the type of\neach arriving agent. We design a $\\frac{1}{k}$-MMS competitive algorithm and\ncomplement it with a lower bound, ruling out any\n$\\Omega(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}})$-MMS-competitive algorithm, even for binary\nvaluations.\n  2- Stochastic arrivals: In this model, the type of each arriving agent is\nindependently drawn from an underlying, possibly unknown distribution.

While offering\npromising applications in talent recruiting, marketing and healthcare, the\nethical implications of Personality Computing are significant. Concerns include\ndata privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for manipulation by\npersonality-aware Artificial Intelligence. This paper provides an overview of\nthe field, explores key methodologies, discusses the challenges and threats,\nand outlines potential future directions for responsible development and\ndeployment of Personality Computing technologies.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the properties of a charged rotating black string immersed in\na Kiselev anisotropic fluid in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. The\nEinstein-Maxwell equations with an anisotropic stress-energy tensor and\ncosmological constant are analyzed and solved exactly. In this work, we\ncalculate the Kretschmann scalar, obtaining a consistent result that agrees\nwith the existing literature in the absence of charge and fluid. The rotating\nsolution is obtained by applying a coordinate transformation on time and\nangular coordinates. The event horizon associated with specific values of the\nequation of state parameter $w_q$ is studied. The results show an important\ninfluence of the fluid parameters $N_{q}$ and $w_{q}$, the charge parameter\n$Q$, and the rotation parameter $a$ on the size of the black string horizon. In\naddition, we determine the conditions for the existence of closed timelike\ncurves (CTCs) and compute the conserved charges, such as mass, angular\nmomentum, and electric charge of the black string. Utilizing the Klein-Gordon\nequation, we employ the quantum particle tunneling approach to obtain the\nprobability of charged scalar particles tunneling across the event horizon. We\nobtain the correspondent Hawking temperature as a consequence. Furthermore, we\nexamine the thermodynamic properties, including entropy and heat capacity, to\nassess the effects of the quintessence field and charge on the black string.\nThe results include particular cases such as the Lemos black string, providing\na broader view of black string configurations in AdS spacetime.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate text\nthat realistically reflects a range of different subjective human perspectives.\nThis paper studies how LLMs are seemingly able to reflect more liberal versus\nmore conservative viewpoints among other political perspectives in American\npolitics. We show that LLMs possess linear representations of political\nperspectives within activation space, wherein more similar perspectives are\nrepresented closer together. To do so, we probe the attention heads across the\nlayers of three open transformer-based LLMs (Llama-2-7b-chat,\nMistral-7b-instruct, Vicuna-7b). We first prompt models to generate text from\nthe perspectives of different U.S. lawmakers. We then identify sets of\nattention heads whose activations linearly predict those lawmakers' DW-NOMINATE\nscores, a widely-used and validated measure of political ideology. We find that\nhighly predictive heads are primarily located in the middle layers, often\nspeculated to encode high-level concepts and tasks. Using probes only trained\nto predict lawmakers' ideology, we then show that the same probes can predict\nmeasures of news outlets' slant from the activations of models prompted to\nsimulate text from those news outlets. These linear probes allow us to\nvisualize, interpret, and monitor ideological stances implicitly adopted by an\nLLM as it generates open-ended responses. Finally, we demonstrate that by\napplying linear interventions to these attention heads, we can steer the model\noutputs toward a more liberal or conservative stance. Overall, our research\nsuggests that LLMs possess a high-level linear representation of American\npolitical ideology and that by leveraging recent advances in mechanistic\ninterpretability, we can identify, monitor, and steer the subjective\nperspective underlying generated text.",

The thermodynamic conditions near the\ngraphite-diamond-liquid (GDL) triple point are especially of interest for\ngeological and technological applications, but high-pressure flash heating\nexperiments aiming to resolve this region of the phase diagram of carbon\nexhibit large discrepancies. Experimental challenges are often related to the\npersistence of metastable crystalline or glassy phases, superheated crystals,\nor supercooled liquids. A deeper understanding of the crystallisation kinetics\nof diamond and graphite is crucial for effectively interpreting the outcomes of\nthese experiments. Here, we reveal the microscopic mechanisms of diamond and\ngraphite nucleation from liquid carbon through molecular simulations with\nfirst-principles machine learning potentials. Our simulations accurately\nreproduce the experimental phase diagram of carbon in the region around the GDL\ntriple point and show that liquid carbon crystallises spontaneously upon\ncooling at constant pressure. Surprisingly, metastable graphite crystallises in\nthe domain of diamond thermodynamic stability at pressures above the triple\npoint. Furthermore, whereas diamond crystallises through a classical nucleation\npathway, graphite follows a two-step process in which low-density fluctuations\nforego ordering. Calculations of the nucleation rates of the two competing\nphases confirm this result and reveal a manifestation of Ostwald's step rule\nwhere the strong metastability of graphite hinders the transformation to the\nstable diamond phase.

    "abstract": "Context. Transition disks (TDs) are a type of protoplanetary disk\ncharacterized by a central dust and gas cavity. The processes behind how these\ncavities are formed and maintained, along with their observed high accretion\nrates of $10^{-8} -10^{-7} \\, M_{\\odot} \\, \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, continue to be\nsubjects of active research. Aims. This work aims to investigate how the\ninclusion of the Hall effect (HE) alongside Ohmic resistivity (OR) and\nambipolar diffusion (AD) affects the structure of the TD. Of key interest is\nthe dynamical evolution of the cavity and whether it can indeed produce\ntransonic accretion, as predicted by theoretical models in order to account for\nthe observed high accretion rates despite the inner disk's low density.\nMethods. We present our results of 2D axisymmetric global radiation\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of TDs for which all three non-ideal MHD\neffects are accounted. We used the NIRVANA-III fluid code and initialized our\nmodel with a disk cavity reaching up to $R=8~\\mathrm{au}$ with a density\ncontrast of $10^5$. We performed three runs, one with only OR and AD, and one\nfor each of the two configurations that arise when additionally including the\nHE, that is, with the field aligned (anti-aligned) with respect to the rotation\naxis. Results. For all three runs, our models maintain an intact inner cavity\nand an outer standard disk. MHD winds are launched both from the cavity and\nfrom the disk. Notably, when the HE is included, ring-like structures develop\nwithin the cavity. We moreover obtain accretion rates of $3 - 8 \\times 10^{-8}\n\\, M_{\\odot} \\, \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, comparable to typical values seen in full\ndisks. Importantly, we clearly observe transonic accretion ($v_{\\mathrm{acc}}\n\\gtrsim c_{s}$) in the cavity. Additionally, outward magnetic flux transport\noccurs in all three runs.",

To\naddress this gap, we conducted a three-month mixed-methods study combining an\nonline survey (N1=248) with in-depth interviews (N2=24) to examine (1) how SOC\nanalysts conceptualize AI-generated explanations and (2) which types of\nexplanations are perceived as actionable and trustworthy across different\nanalyst roles. Our findings reveal that participants were consistently willing\nto accept XAI outputs, even in cases of lower predictive accuracy, when\nexplanations were perceived as relevant and evidence-backed.

Rev. A 81,\n053805 (2010)] (with some expanded discussion), a full derivation for the\nabsolute generation rate of photon pairs from Spontaneous-Parametric\nDown-Conversion (SPDC) when using a focused gaussian pump beam as input, and\ncollecting the output biphotons in a pair of focused gaussian collection modes.\nWe do this to both show consistency between our formalism and his treatment,\nand to be able to use it to predict the absolute brightness of photon pair\ngeneration in these sources. In doing so, our formula differs from that in\n[Phys. Rev. A 81, 053805 (2010)] by only a constant factor based on the ratio\nof products of indices of refraction.\n  Second, we correct an abuse of notation in our main work in which the\nquantization dimensions of the cavity modes of the electromagnetic field are\nconflated with the dimensions of the nonlinear medium. While this does not\nmeaningfully affect the final formulas we obtain for the generation rates in\nthe paper (adding a dimensionless correction factor of order unity), we use the\ngaussian-mode SPDC derivation here to show how the factors of the quantization\ndimensions disappear when converting from a discrete-momentum basis of\nrectangular cavity modes to a continuous frequency basis of gaussian spatial\nmodes. In doing this, we find that applying this correction factor to our\nprevious theoretical predictions for the photon pair generation rates brings\nthem closer to the obtained experimental values.",

Each of these detectors\nincorporates an FPGA-based Digital Front End known as RPC-DAQ, with the primary\nobjective of measuring the position and timing of particle interactions within\nthe respective RPCs. The firmware embedded in the RPC-DAQ FPGA is designed to\nsupport this logic. The ICAL experiment is a 50-kiloton iron structure arranged\nin a stacked geometry where the RPCs along with their associated electronics\nare positioned between these iron plates. Reprogramming individual or groups of\nRPC-DAQs proves to be a challenging and time consuming task. To address the\ncomplexity of upgrading firmware for these typically inaccessible RPC-DAQs this\npaper introduces an innovative approach that utilizes the existing Ethernet\ninterface, employed for command transmission and data acquisition to upload\nfirmware. A customized handshaking architecture has been designed using the TCP\nprotocol for this experiment. The firmware binary file is segmented into TCP\npackets and transmitted over Ethernet. The soft-core processor instantiated in\nthe RPC-DAQ FPGA receives these firmware packets overwriting the existing\nfirmware in the flash memory. Upon rebooting the RPC-DAQ configures the new\nfirmware on the FPGA. The entire firmware upgrade process takes around 13\nseconds to configure 10 RPC-DAQs.

Here, we utilize deep new ALMA imaging, new and\nexisting JWST/MIRI imaging, and archival Spitzer/Herschel imaging of two of the\nrest-optically brightest LRDs ($z=3.1$ and $z=4.47$) to place the strongest\nconstraints on the IR luminosity in LRDs to date.

Similarly, FIR non-detections\nrule out any appreciable cold ($T\\lesssim75$ K) dust component.

Despite\nthese advancements, the high inference latency and the \"overthinking\" issues in\nmodel inference impair the efficiency and effectiveness of foundation models,\nthus limiting their application in real-time clinical settings. To address\nthese challenges, we proposed EPEE (Entropy- and Patience-based Early Exiting),\na novel hybrid strategy designed to improve the inference efficiency of\nfoundation models. The core idea was to leverage the strengths of entropy-based\nand patience-based early exiting methods to overcome their respective\nweaknesses. To evaluate EPEE, we conducted experiments on three core biomedical\ntasks-classification, relation extraction, and event extraction-using four\nfoundation models (BERT, ALBERT, GPT-2, and ViT) across twelve datasets,\nincluding clinical notes and medical images. The results showed that EPEE\nsignificantly reduced inference time while maintaining or improving accuracy,\ndemonstrating its adaptability to diverse datasets and tasks. EPEE addressed\ncritical barriers to deploying foundation models in healthcare by balancing\nefficiency and effectiveness.

These fluctuations modify Hawking\nevaporation rates, and therefore also affect how the black hole state evolves\nover time. In previous work on Schwarzian-corrected Hawking radiation, the\nblack hole was taken to be in the microcanonical or canonical ensemble\n[arXiv:2411.03447]. However, we find that an initially fixed-energy or\nfixed-temperature state does not remain so in the regime where Schwarzian\ncorrections are important. We consider three decay channels: the emission of\nmassless scalars, photons, and entangled pairs of photons in angular momentum\nsinglet states. In each of the three cases, we find that in the very low\nenergy, quantum dominated regime, the probability distribution of the black\nhole energy level occupation tends toward a particular attractor function that\neffectively depends on only one combination of time and energy. This function\nis independent of the initial state and gives new predictions for the energy\nfluxes and Hawking emission spectra of near-extremal charged black holes.",

Traditional simultaneous\nlocalization and mapping (SLAM) approaches struggle to maintain consistent\nscene representations because of numerous moving objects, often treating\ndynamic elements as outliers rather than explicitly modeling them in the scene\nrepresentation. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical 3D scene\ngraph-based SLAM framework that addresses the challenge of modeling and\nestimating the pose of dynamic objects and agents. We use fiducial markers to\ndetect dynamic entities and to extract their attributes while improving\nkeyframe selection and implementing new capabilities for dynamic entity\nmapping. We maintain a hierarchical representation where dynamic objects are\nregistered in the SLAM graph and are constrained with robot keyframes and the\nfloor level of the building with our novel entity-keyframe constraints and\nintra-entity constraints. By combining semantic and geometric constraints\nbetween dynamic entities and the environment, our system jointly optimizes the\nSLAM graph to estimate the pose of the robot and various dynamic agents and\nobjects while maintaining an accurate map. Experimental evaluation demonstrates\nthat our approach achieves a 27.57% reduction in pose estimation error compared\nto traditional methods and enables higher-level reasoning about scene dynamics.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of using diffusion models to generate fast, smooth,\nand temporally consistent robot motions. Although diffusion models have\ndemonstrated superior performance in robot learning due to their task\nscalability and multi-modal flexibility, they suffer from two fundamental\nlimitations: (1) they often produce non-smooth, jerky motions due to their\ninability to capture temporally consistent movement dynamics, and (2) their\niterative sampling process incurs prohibitive latency for many robotic tasks.\nInspired by classic robot motion generation methods such as DMPs and ProMPs,\nwhich capture temporally and spatially consistent dynamic of trajectories using\nlow-dimensional vectors -- and by recent advances in diffusion-based image\ngeneration that use consistency models with probability flow ODEs to accelerate\nthe denoising process, we propose Fast Robot Motion Diffusion (FRMD). FRMD\nuniquely integrates Movement Primitives (MPs) with Consistency Models to enable\nefficient, single-step trajectory generation. By leveraging probabilistic flow\nODEs and consistency distillation, our method models trajectory distributions\nwhile learning a compact, time-continuous motion representation within an\nencoder-decoder architecture. This unified approach eliminates the slow,\nmulti-step denoising process of conventional diffusion models, enabling\nefficient one-step inference and smooth robot motion generation. We extensively\nevaluated our FRMD on the well-recognized Meta-World and ManiSkills Benchmarks,\nranging from simple to more complex manipulation tasks, comparing its\nperformance against state-of-the-art baselines.

Finally,\nthey fail to differentiate the importance of points with similar features,\nleading to suboptimal selection of points to retain the original trajectory\ninformation.\n  We propose MLSimp, a novel Mutual Learning query-driven trajectory\nsimplification framework that integrates two distinct models: GNN-TS, based on\ngraph neural networks, and Diff-TS, based on diffusion models.

    "abstract": "Three-body resonances are ubiquitous in few-body physics and are\ncharacterized by a finite lifetime before decaying into continuum states of\ntheir composing subsystems. In this work we present a theoretical study on the\npossibility to stabilize three-body resonances to so-called bound states in a\ncontinuum: resonances with vanishing width that do not decay. Within a simple\ntwo-channel approach we unveil the underlying mechanism and suggest that the\nlifetime can be varied by a continuous tuning of system parameters. The\nvalidity of our theory is illustrated in two rather different examples, a\nmass-imbalanced system in one dimension and a system of three identical bosons\nin three dimensions, relevant to Efimov physics. Crucially, for the latter we\nfind that one of the tunable parameters to achieve a three-body bound state in\na continuum is an external magnetic field, a common tunable variable in\ncold-atom experiments. Due to the fundamental nature of our theory, it is\nexpected to hold in other few-body systems, possibly opening new avenues for\nbasic studies of otherwise unstable systems, and elevating few-body systems to\ninteresting candidates for quantum technology.",

This paper\nproposes the use of location encoders for modeling continuous, learnable domain\nassignment.

    "abstract": "Advances in novel hardware devices and architectures allow Spiking Neural\nNetwork evaluation using ultra-low power, mixed-signal, memristor crossbar\narrays. As individual network sizes quickly scale beyond the dimensional\ncapabilities of single crossbars, networks must be mapped onto multiple\ncrossbars. Crossbar sizes within modern Memristor Crossbar Architectures are\ndetermined predominately not by device technology but by network topology;\nmore, smaller crossbars consume less area thanks to the high structural\nsparsity found in larger, brain-inspired SNNs. Motivated by continuing\nincreases in SNN sparsity due to improvements in training methods, we propose\nutilizing heterogeneous crossbar sizes to further reduce area consumption. This\napproach was previously unachievable as prior compiler studies only explored\nsolutions targeting homogeneous MCAs. Our work improves on the state-of-the-art\nby providing Integer Linear Programming formulations supporting arbitrarily\nheterogeneous architectures. By modeling axonal interactions between neurons\nour methods produce better mappings while removing inhibitive a priori\nknowledge requirements. We first show a 16.7-27.6% reduction in area\nconsumption for square-crossbar homogeneous architectures. Then, we demonstrate\n66.9-72.7% further reduction when using a reasonable configuration of\nheterogeneous crossbar dimensions. Next, we present a new optimization\nformulation capable of minimizing the number of inter-crossbar routes. When\napplied to solutions already near-optimal in area an 11.9-26.4% routing\nreduction is observed without impacting area consumption. Finally, we present a\nprofile-guided optimization capable of minimizing the number of runtime spikes\nbetween crossbars. Compared to the best-area-then-route optimized solutions we\nobserve a further 0.5-14.8% inter-crossbar spike reduction while requiring 1-3\norders of magnitude less solver time.",

Both simulation and empirical evidence are\nprovided. Through the applications of these models using the S&P Indian index,\nthe study shows that the market returns are characterised by these volatility\nfeatures. Our findings from the long-memory behaviour revealed that although\nthe response to shocks is greater in the short-term component, it is however\nshort-lived. On the contrary, despite a high degree of persistence in the\nlong-term component, market information or unexpected news arrival only has a\nlow long-run impact on the market. Based on this, the long-run investment risks\nwithin the Indian stock market seem to be under control.

One can apply the classic\ntemporal-difference (TD) learning method for solving these problems where this\nmethod learns the value function of each task independently. In this paper, we\nare interested in understanding whether one can exploit the low-rank structure\nof the multi-task setting to accelerate the performance of TD learning. To\nanswer this question, we propose a new variant of TD learning method, where we\nintegrate the so-called truncated singular value decomposition step into the\nupdate of TD learning. This additional step will enable TD learning to exploit\nthe dominant directions due to the low rank structure to update the iterates,\ntherefore, improving its performance. Our empirical results show that the\nproposed method significantly outperforms the classic TD learning, where the\nperformance gap increases as the rank $r$ decreases.\n  From the theoretical point of view, introducing the truncated singular value\ndecomposition step into TD learning might cause an instability on the updates.\nWe provide a theoretical result showing that the instability does not happen.\nSpecifically, we prove that the proposed method converges at a rate\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{\\ln(t)}{t})$, where $t$ is the number of iterations.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the gamma-ray spectral and timing results from the\nlong-term regular observations of Mrk 421 with the Large Area Telescope (LAT)\nonboard Fermi during 2008 August - 2023 August. We discerned six periods the\nrelatively stronger 0.3-300 GeV activity compared to other time intervals. The\nbaseline brightness level varied on timescales from several months to years\nduring these periods, which was superimposed by shorter-term flares of the\ndifferent asymmetry associated with various interplay between the\nlight-crossing, particle acceleration and cooling timescales. The source also\nfrequently exhibited two-peak flares, to be triggered by the propagation of\nforward and reverse shocks after collision between the shells of high-energy\nplasma, moving with different speeds down the jet. The strongest long-term\nflaring activity was recorded during 2012 June - 2013 October and 2017 October\n- 2018 March, when the source was robustly detectable even on intraday\ntimescales. We detected 25 instances of intraday variability and a large number\nof the flux doubling or halving instances. The source generally showed a\nlognormal variability in the LAT energy range, explained as an imprinting of\nthe disc nonstationary processes on the jet, proton-initiated hadronic cascades\nor random fluctuations in the particle acceleration rate. Most of the 0.3-300\nGeV spectra were well-fit with a simple power-law model and showed a very broad\nrange of the photon-index from 2.8 down to 1.2, with the mean values of\n1.75-1.84 and distribution peaks at 1.73-1.82 during the periods of strong\nactivity. Our spectral study also revealed the features of inverse-Compton\nupscatter of X-ray photons in the Klein-Nishina regime, relativistic magnetic\nreconnection, first-order Fermi mechanism within the magnetic field of\ndifferent confinement efficiencies and stochastic acceleration",

To reduce the\nfrequency bias, we adopt the multi-stage FNO training, i.e., after training a\n1st stage FNO model for estimating the ground motion, we use a second FNO model\nas the 2nd stage to learn from the residual, which greatly reduced the errors\non the higher frequencies. By adopting this multi-stage training, the FNO\nmodels show reduced biases on higher frequencies, which enhanced the overall\nresults of the ground motion simulations. Thus the multi-stage training FNO\nimproves the accuracy and realism of the ground motion simulations.",

In intelligent enterprises, machine\nlearning based models are adopted to extract insights from data. Due to the\nefficiency and privacy challenges of these traditional models, a new federated\nlearning (FL) paradigm has emerged. In FL, multiple enterprises can jointly\ntrain a model to update a final model. However, firstly, FL trained models\nusually perform worse than centralized models, especially when enterprises\ntraining data is non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed). Second, due\nto the centrality of FL and the untrustworthiness of local enterprises,\ntraditional FL solutions are vulnerable to poisoning and inference attacks and\nviolate privacy. Thirdly, the continuous transfer of parameters between\nenterprises and servers increases communication costs. To this end, the\nFedAnil+ model is proposed, a novel, lightweight, and secure Federated Deep\nLearning Model that includes three main phases. In the first phase, the goal is\nto solve the data type distribution skew challenge. Addressing privacy concerns\nagainst poisoning and inference attacks is covered in the second phase.\nFinally, to alleviate the communication overhead, a novel compression approach\nis proposed that significantly reduces the size of the updates.

We find one-dimensional steady state\ndecretion disc solutions that smoothly transition from a rapidly rotating star\nthat is in hydrostatic balance. Boundary layer effects in a geometrically thick\ndisc which connects to a rotationally flattened star enable the formation of a\ndecretion disc at stellar spin rates below the break up rate. For a disc with\nan aspect ratio $H/R\\approx 0.1$ at the inner edge, the torque from the disc on\nthe star slows the stellar spin to the observed range and mass ejection\ncontinues at a rate consistent with observed decretion rates. The critical\nrotation rate, to which the star slows down to, decreases as the disc aspect\nratio increases. More generally, steady state accretion and decretion disc\nsolutions can be found for all stellar spin rates.

As part of this method, we contribute a new RGBD\ndiffusion model that allows for strength control over appearance and shape\nstylization. To ensure consistency across stylized frames, we use a combination\nof novel depth-guided cross attention, feature injection, and a Warp ControlNet\nconditioned on composite frames for guiding the stylization of new frames. We\nvalidate our method via extensive qualitative results, quantitative\nexperiments, and a user study. Code online.",

    "abstract": "The chemical industry's transition to net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\nis particularly challenging due to the carbon inherently contained in chemical\nproducts, eventually released to the environment. Fossil feedstock-based\nproduction can be replaced by electrified chemical production, combining carbon\ncapture and utilization (CCU) with electrolysis-based hydrogen. However,\nelectrified chemical production requires vast amounts of clean electricity,\nleading to competition in our sector-coupled energy systems. In this work, we\ninvestigate the pathway of the chemical industry towards electrified production\nwithin the context of a sector-coupled national energy system's transition to\nnet-zero emissions. Our results show that the sectors for electricity,\nlow-temperature heat, and mobility transition before the chemical industry due\nto the required build-up of renewables, and to the higher emissions abatement\nof heat pumps and battery electric vehicles. To achieve the net-zero target,\nthe energy system relies on clean energy imports to cover 41\\% of its\nelectricity needs, largely driven by the high energy requirements of a fully\nelectrified chemical industry. Nonetheless, a partially electrified industry\ncombined with dispatchable production alternatives provides flexibility to the\nenergy system by enabling electrified production when renewable electricity is\navailable. Hence, a partially electrified, diversified chemical industry can\nsupport the integration of intermittent renewables, serving as a valuable\ncomponent in net-zero energy systems.",

Existing studies focus\nexclusively on narrowband FAS, performing channel estimation solely in the\nspatial domain. This work proposes a channel estimation and spatial\nequalization framework for wideband FAS, revealing for the first time an\ninherent group-sparse structure in aperture-limited FAS channels. First, we\nestablish a group-sparse recovery framework for space-frequency characteristics\nin FAS, formally characterizing leakage-induced sparsity degradation from\nlimited aperture and bandwidth as a structured group-sparsity problem. By\nderiving dictionary-adapted group restricted isometry property, we prove tight\nrecovery bounds for a convex $\\ell_1/\\ell_2$-mixed norm optimization\nformulation that preserves leakage-aware sparsity patterns. Second, we develop\na descending correlation group orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm that\nsystematically relaxes leakage constraints to reduce subcoherence. This\napproach enables FSC recovery with accelerated convergence and superior\nperformance compared to conventional compressive sensing methods like OMP or\nGOMP. Third, we formulate spatial equalization as a mixed-integer linear\nprogramming problem, complement this with a greedy algorithm maintaining\nnear-optimal performance. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed channel\nestimation algorithm effectively resolves energy misallocation and enables\nrecovery of weak details, achieving superior recovery accuracy and convergence\nrate.

We find a clear age pattern in the contiguous\ncentral region (CirCe), where younger stars are found further from the massive\ncentral cluster, and where the velocities are consistent with uniform\nexpansion.

We also find\nthat filaments with a range of distances from the central cluster can naturally\nproduce multi-generational age sequences due to differences in feedback\nstrength and exposure. Outlying populations show velocities consistent with\nformation independent from the CirCe region, but with similar enough velocities\nthat they may be difficult to distinguish from one another later in their\nexpansion.

These interactions can explain the presence\nof circumstellar material in many CCSNe, and the inferred low mass in\nstripped-envelope supernova progenitors. Through binary interactions, stars can\ngain mass, lose mass, or merge, impacting their final properties. Specific\nsub-types of binary interaction products have been investigated but few\ndetailed full population models exist. Using thousands of detailed simulations\nwith updated prescriptions for binary interactions and winds at Milky Way and\nMagellanic Clouds metallicities, we follow the evolution of single massive\nstars, primaries in interacting binaries and coalescence products following\ncommon envelope evolution. We also follow the evolution of the surviving\nsecondary star, with a compact companion formed from the evolutionary end of\nthe primary star or alone if the system was disrupted in the first supernova.\nThe endpoints of our simulations map the rich landscape of CCSN progenitors,\nand provide detailed mass-loss history and progenitor structures. We identify\nan important evolutionary phase for stripped-envelope supernova progenitors, in\nwhich the wind mass-loss rate of stars stripped by binary interaction rapidly\nincreases in their final evolutionary stages, after core helium burning. These\nstrong winds would give rise to a Wolf-Rayet (WR) spectral appearance, though\nonly for a few millennia, in contrast to hundreds of millennia for their more\nmassive WR counterparts. Such lightweight WR stars in binaries can account for\nobserved properties of type Ib/c supernovae.",

Yet, it modifies gravity such that spacetime\nsingularities can be avoided. This has led to the Cuscuton bounce, a\nnonsingular cosmology that has been shown to be linearly stable, which is a\nrare feat. Upon introducing mechanisms known to generate a near-scale-invariant\npower spectrum of isocurvature perturbations in the prebounce contracting\nphase, we perform an extensive linear analysis of all scalar perturbations as\nthey evolve through the Cuscuton bounce, both analytically and numerically.\nThen, after deriving the third-order perturbed action for our theory, we\ncompare the magnitude of its terms (on shell) to those in the second-order\naction. We show that perturbativity is maintained in the infrared throughout\nthe evolution, including through the bounce. In the ultraviolet, we show that a\nhierarchy of scales is maintained, with the strong coupling scale well above\nthe relevant background energy scale at all times. We reconfirm these results\nby computing the three-point functions in various limits and demonstrate that\nthe models do not have any strong coupling problems and furthermore that there\nis negligible non-Gaussianities on observable scales. Consequently, the primary\npotential source of observable non-Gaussianities may only arise from the\nconversion of isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations. The whole\nscenario is thus a robust, stable, weakly coupled nonsingular cosmological\nmodel, consistent with observations.",

    "abstract": "Outflows are a key element in the baryon cycle of galaxies, and their\nproperties provide a fundamental test for our models of how star formation\nquenches in galaxies. Here we report the detection of outflowing gas in two\nrecently quenched, massive ($M_\\star\\sim10^{10.2}M_\\odot$) galaxies at z=4.106\n(NS_274) and z=7.276 (RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The\noutflows are traced by blue-shifted MgII absorption lines, and in the case of\nthe z=4.1 system, also by FeII and NaI features. The spectra of the two sources\nare similar to those of local post-starburst galaxies, showing deep Balmer\nfeatures and minimal star formation on 10 Myr timescales as traced by the lack\nof bright emission lines, also suggesting the absence of a strong and\nradiatively efficient AGN. The galaxies' SFHs are consistent with an abrupt\nquenching of star formation, which continued at rates of $\\sim15\\,M_\\odot$/yr\naveraged over 100 Myr timescales. Dedicated millimeter observations of NS_274\nconstrain its dust obscured SFR to $<12\\,M_\\odot$/yr. Under simple geometrical\nassumptions, we derive mass loading factors $\\lesssim1$ and $>10$ for the z=4.1\nand z=7.3 systems, respectively, and similarly different energies carried by\nthe outflows. Supernova feedback can account for the mass and energy of the\noutflow in NS_274. However, the low mass loading factor and average gas\nvelocity suggest that the observed outflow is likely not the primary factor\nbehind its quenching. SF-related processes seem to be insufficient to explain\nthe extreme mass outflow rate of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7, which would require an\nadditional ejective mechanism such as an undetected AGN. Finally, the average\noutflow velocities per unit $M_\\star$, SFR, or its surface area are consistent\nwith those of lower-redshift post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that outflows\nin rapidly quenched galaxies might occur similarly across cosmic time.\n[Abridged]",

    "abstract": "The Monte Carlo method is typically considered the gold standard for\nsimulating reactor physics problems, as it does not require discretization of\nthe phase space. This is not necessarily true though when simulating multigroup\nproblems, as it has traditionally been a challenge to model anisotropic\nscattering in such simulations. Multigroup data used in reactor simulations\ngenerally uses low order Legendre expansion for scattering distributions, often\nstopping at the third Legendre moment. With so few terms, the angular\ndistribution can easily have negative regions for highly anisotropic energy\ntransfers, which makes it impossible to use standard Monte Carlo methods to\nsample a scattering angle. Multigroup Monte Carlo codes therefore often resort\nto only using isotropic scattering with the transport correction (which is not\nalways possible), or approximating the angular distribution with discrete\nangles. Neither case is ideal, and makes it impossible to accurately model such\nproblems or verify deterministic codes that can and do make use of the low\norder Legendre expansions without issue. This is addressed in the present study\nby using importance sampling in conjunction with negative particle weights to\nsample scattering angles from negative scattering distributions. It is\ndemonstrated that such an approach necessitates the use of weight cancellation\nmethods in order to be stable and converge to a solution. The technique is\ntested on two simple analytic benchmark problems, and then further demonstrated\nby modeling a small zero power research reactor, comparing results against a\ndeterministic solver which can treat anisotropic scattering. Comparison of the\nsimulation results indicates that importance sampling for anisotropic\nscattering with weight cancellation can be used to obtain reference Monte Carlo\nresults for multigroup problems despite negative scattering distributions.",

We show that even certain\nexponentially decaying correlations can imply gaplessness. This is exemplified\nby the deformed toric code $\\propto \\exp(\\beta \\sum_{\\ell} Z_{\\ell})\n|\\mathsf{TC}\\rangle$, where $|\\mathsf{TC}\\rangle$ is a fixed-point toric code\nwavefunction. Although it has a confined regime for $\\beta > \\beta_c$, recent\nwork has drawn attention to its perimeter law loop correlations. Here, we show\nthat these unusual loop correlations -- namely, perimeter law coexisting with a\n1-form symmetry whose disorder operator has long-range order -- imply that any\nlocal parent Hamiltonian must either be gapless or have a degeneracy scaling\nwith system size. Moreover, we construct a variational low-energy state for\narbitrary local frustration-free Hamiltonians, upper bounding the finite-size\ngap by $O(1/L^3)$ on periodic boundary conditions. Strikingly, these\nvariational states look like loop waves -- non-quasiparticle analogs of spin\nwaves -- generated from the ground state by non-local loop operators. Our\nfindings have implications for identifying the subset of Hilbert space to which\ngapped ground states belong, and the techniques have wide applicability. For\ninstance, a corollary of our first result is that Glauber dynamics for the\nordered phase of the two-dimensional classical Ising model on the torus must\nhave a gapless Markov transition matrix, with our second result bounding its\ngap.",

We find that the orbital evolution of the clumps has a\nstochastic character but also exhibits recurrent properties over many orbits.\nClump migration is governed by two sources of gravitational torques: a torque\noriginating from a region about twice the Hill sphere around each clump's\norbit, and the torque resulting from clump-clump interactions. Compared to\nnon-magnetized companion runs, the latter are more frequent in MHD simulations,\nwhich give rise to more numerous clumps starting off at smaller masses, often\nbelow a Neptune mass. Clump-clump interactions can lead to temporary strong\naccelerations of migration in both directions, but integrated over time provide\na lesser impact than disc-driven torques. They can also lead to clump mergers\nbut do not cause ejections; a difference to previous works which adopted sink\nparticles. The local \"Hill torque\" is responsible for the fast migration,\ninward or outward. Estimating the characteristic timescales of conventional\nmigration in our regime, we find that the disc-driven migration timescales are\nin agreement with Type III migration. However, the dominant local torque is\nrapidly fluctuating, which reflects the turbulent nature of the flow.

Enceladus's observed\nphenomena emerge from the model, and the predicted values for the orbital\neccentricity, libration amplitude, shell thickness, and luminosity agree with\nobservations. A single limit cycle lasts around ten million years, and has\nthree distinct stages: (1) freezing, (2) melting, and (3) resonant libration.\nEnceladus is currently in the freezing stage, meaning that its ice shell is\ngetting thicker. That pressurizes the ocean, which in turn cracks the shell and\npushes water up through the cracks. In this stage the orbital eccentricity\nincreases, as Saturn pushes Enceladus deeper into resonance with Dione. Once\nthe eccentricity is sufficiently high, tidal heating begins to melt the shell,\nwhich is the second stage of the cycle. In the third stage the shell remains\nclose to 3km thick. At that thickness the shell's natural libration frequency\nis resonant with the orbital frequency. The shell's librations are consequently\ndriven to large amplitude, for millions of years. Most of the tidal heating of\nEnceladus occurs during this stage, and the observed luminosity is a relic from\nthe last episode of resonant libration.",

    "abstract": "JWST is detecting an excess of high-redshift ($z\\gtrsim 10$), bright galaxies\nchallenging most theoretical predictions. To address this issue, we investigate\nthe impact of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) on the halo mass function and UV\nluminosity function (LF) of super-early galaxies. We explore two key effects:\n(i) the enhancement of massive halos abundance due to the compact nature and\nspatial distribution of PBHs, and (ii) the luminosity boost, characterized by\nthe Eddington ratio $\\lambda_E$, due to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) powered by\nmatter accretion onto PBHs. We build an effective model, calibrated using data\nat lower redshifts ($z\\approx 4-9$), to derive the evolution of the LF\nincluding the additional PBH contribution. Via Bayesian analysis, we find that:\n(a) Although a small fraction ($\\log f_{\\rm PBH} \\approx -5.42$) of massive\n($\\log M_{\\rm PBH} / {\\rm M_{\\odot}} \\approx 8.37$), non-emitting\n($\\lambda_E=0$) PBHs can explain the galaxy excess via the halo abundance\nenhancement, this solution is excluded by CMB $\\mu$-distortion constraints on\nmonochromatic PBHs. (b) If PBHs power an AGN emitting at super-Eddington\nluminosity ($\\lambda_E \\approx 10$), the observed LF can be reproduced by a PBH\npopulation with characteristic mass $\\log M_{\\rm PBH} / {\\rm M_{\\odot}} \\approx\n3.69$ constituting a tiny ($\\log f_{\\rm PBH} \\approx -8.16$) fraction of the\ncosmic dark matter content. In the AGN scenario, about 75% of the observed\ngalaxies with ${\\rm M_{UV}}=-21$ at $z=11$ should host a PBH-powered AGN and\ntypically reside in low mass halos, $M_h = 10^{8-9} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$. These\npredictions can be tested with available and forthcoming JWST spectroscopic\ndata. We note that our analysis considers a lognormal PBH mass function and\ncompares its parameters with monochromatic limits on PBH abundance. Further\nwork is required to relax such limitations.",

On average,\nclusters experience 2 to 3 transformations. Transformations can occur in both\ndirections and can be temporary, but those to higher entropy cores, i.e. in the\ndirection from CC to NCC states, are the vast majority. CC phases are shorter\nthan NCC phases, and thus overall the TNG-Cluster population forms with\nlow-entropy cores and moves towards NCC states with time. We study the role\nthat mergers play in driving transformations, and find that mergers within\n~1Gyr prior to a transformation toward higher (but not lower) entropy cores\noccur statistically more often than in a random control sample. Most\nimportantly, we find examples of mergers associated with CC disruption\nregardless of their mass ratio or angular momentum. However, past merger\nactivity is not a good predictor for z=0 CC status, at least based on core\nentropy, even though clusters undergoing more mergers eventually have the\nhighest core entropy values at z=0. We consider the interplay between AGN\nfeedback and evolving cluster core thermodynamics. We find that core\ntransformations are accompanied by an increase in AGN activity, whereby\nfrequent and repeated (kinetic) energy injections from the central SMBHs can\nproduce a collective, long-term impact on central entropy, ultimately heating\ncluster cores. Whether such fast-paced periods of AGN activity are triggered by\nmergers is plausible, but not necessary.",

However, the various\nchemical and radiative-transfer effects, in combination with projection\neffects, can lead to a distorted view of molecular clouds. Our objective is to\nsimultaneously study all of these effects by creating synthetic spectral-line\nobservations based on a chemo-dynamical simulation of a collapsing molecular\ncloud. We performed a 3D ideal MHD simulation of a supercritical turbulent\ncollapsing molecular cloud where the dynamical evolution was coupled to a\nnonequilibrium gas-grain chemical network consisting of 115 species, the\nevolution of which was governed by >1600 chemical reactions. We post-processed\nthis simulation with a multilevel non-LTE radiative-transfer code to produce\nsynthetic PPV data cubes of the CO, HCO+, HCN, and N2H+ (J = 1-0) transitions\nunder various projection angles with respect to the mean component of the\nmagnetic field. We find that the chemical abundances of various species in our\nsimulated cloud tend to be over-predicted in comparison to observationally\nderived abundances and attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the cloud\ncollapses rapidly and therefore the various species do not have enough time to\ndeplete onto dust grains. This suggests that our initial conditions may not\ncorrespond to the initial conditions of real molecular clouds and cores. We\nshow that the projection angle has a notable effect on the moment maps of the\nspecies for which we produced synthetic observations. Specifically, the\nintegrated emission and velocity dispersion of CO, HCO+, and HCN are higher\nwhen the cloud is observed \"face on\" compared to \"edge on,\" whereas column\ndensity maps exhibit an opposite trend.

Most research\non stereotypes in LLMs has primarily relied on indirect evaluation setups, in\nwhich models are prompted to select between pairs of sentences associated with\nparticular social groups. Recently, direct evaluation methods have emerged,\nexamining open-ended model responses to overcome limitations of previous\napproaches, such as annotator biases. Most existing studies have focused on\nEnglish-centric LLMs, whereas research on non-English models, particularly\nJapanese, remains sparse, despite the growing development and adoption of these\nmodels. This study examines the safety of Japanese LLMs when responding to\nstereotype-triggering prompts in direct setups. We constructed 3,612 prompts by\ncombining 301 social group terms, categorized by age, gender, and other\nattributes, with 12 stereotype-inducing templates in Japanese. Responses were\nanalyzed from three foundational models trained respectively on Japanese,\nEnglish, and Chinese language. Our findings reveal that LLM-jp, a Japanese\nnative model, exhibits the lowest refusal rate and is more likely to generate\ntoxic and negative responses compared to other models. Additionally, prompt\nformat significantly influence the output of all models, and the generated\nresponses include exaggerated reactions toward specific social groups, varying\nacross models. These findings underscore the insufficient ethical safety\nmechanisms in Japanese LLMs and demonstrate that even high-accuracy models can\nproduce biased outputs when processing Japanese-language prompts. We advocate\nfor improving safety mechanisms and bias mitigation strategies in Japanese\nLLMs, contributing to ongoing discussions on AI ethics beyond linguistic\nboundaries.",

    "abstract": "The Photometric Objects Around Cosmic Webs (PAC) method integrates\ncosmological photometric and spectroscopic surveys, offering valuable insights\ninto galaxy formation. PAC measures the excess surface density of photometric\nobjects, $\\bar{n}_2w_{\\rm{p}}$, with specific physical properties around\nspectroscopic tracers. In this study, we improve the PAC method to make it more\nrigorous and eliminate the need for redshift bins. We apply the enhanced PAC\nmethod to the DESI Y1 BGS Bright spectroscopic sample and the deep DECaLS\nphotometric sample, obtaining $\\bar{n}_2w_{\\rm{p}}$ measurements across the\ncomplete stellar mass range, from $10^{5.3}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ to $10^{11.5}{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$ for blue galaxies, and from $10^{6.3}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ to\n$10^{11.9}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ for red galaxies. We combine $\\bar{n}_2w_{\\rm{p}}$\nwith $w_{\\rm{p}}$ measurements from the BGS sample, which is not necessarily\ncomplete in stellar mass. Assuming that galaxy bias is primarily determined by\nstellar mass and colour, we derive the galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs)\ndown to $10^{5.3}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ for blue galaxies and $10^{6.3}{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$ for red galaxies, while also setting lower limits for smaller\nmasses. The blue and red GSMFs are well described by single and double\nSchechter functions, respectively, with low-mass end slopes of\n$\\alpha_{\\rm{blue}}=-1.54^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ and\n$\\alpha_{\\rm{red}}=-2.50^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$, resulting in the dominance of red\ngalaxies below $10^{7.6}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. Stage-IV cosmological photometric\nsurveys, capable of reaching 2-3 magnitudes deeper than DECaLS, present an\nopportunity to explore the entire galaxy population in the local universe with\nPAC.

Here, we analyze the SFE in THESAN-ZOOM, a novel zoom-in\nradiation-hydrodynamic simulation campaign of high-redshift ($z \\gtrsim 3$)\ngalaxies employing a state-of-the-art galaxy formation model resolving the\nmultiphase interstellar medium (ISM). The halo-scale SFE ($\\epsilon^{\\ast}_{\\rm\nhalo}$) - the fraction of baryons accreted by a halo that are converted to\nstars - follows a double power-law dependence on halo mass, with a mild\nredshift evolution above $M_{\\rm halo} \\gtrsim 10^{9.5}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. The\npower-law slope is roughly $1/3$ at large halo masses, consistent with\nexpectations when gas outflows are momentum-driven. At lower masses, the slope\nis roughly $2/3$ and is more aligned with the energy-driven outflow scenario.\n$\\epsilon^{\\ast}_{\\rm halo}$ is a factor of $2-3$ larger than commonly assumed\nin empirical galaxy-formation models at $M_{\\rm halo} \\lesssim 10^{11}\\,{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$. On galactic (kpc) scales, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation of\nneutral gas is universal in THESAN-ZOOM, following $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR} \\propto\n\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}^2$, indicative of a turbulent energy balance in the ISM\nmaintained by stellar feedback. The rise of $\\epsilon^{\\ast}_{\\rm halo}$ with\nhalo mass can be traced primarily to increasing gas surface densities in\nmassive galaxies, while the underlying KS relation and neutral, star-forming\ngas fraction remain unchanged. Although the increase in $\\epsilon^{\\ast}_{\\rm\nhalo}$ with redshift is relatively modest, it is sufficient to explain the\nlarge observed number density of UV-bright galaxies at $z \\gtrsim 12$. However,\nreproducing the brightest sources at $M_{\\rm UV} \\lesssim -21$ may require\nextrapolating the SFE beyond the halo mass range directly covered by\nTHESAN-ZOOM.",

The pair resides in the\ncore of a known rich overdensity of galaxies, dubbed the \"Cosmic Vine\". For\nboth pair members, modeling of the Spectral Energy Distributions and faint\nrest-frame optical emission lines indicate high stellar masses\n($\\log{(M_\\star/M_\\odot)}\\sim10.9$) and suppressed star formation ($\\log{\\rm\n(sSFR/yr^{-1})}<-10$), more than an order of magnitude below the level of the\nstar formation main sequence at this redshift. We then explore the\nIllustris-TNG simulation and the GAEA and SHARK semi-analytical models to\nexamine whether they produce a pair of massive quiescent galaxies akin to that\nof the Cosmic Vine. While all models produce close pairs of massive quiescent\ngalaxies at $2<z<4$ with comparable separations and velocity offsets, their\npredicted number densities are $10-80$ times lower than our observational\nconstraint. This discrepancy cannot be fully explained by coarse time sampling\nin these models or the general challenge of forming early massive quiescent\ngalaxies in simulations. Given that $>90\\%$ of simulated pairs in the models\nthat we analyzed merge by $z=0$, our findings suggest that our observed pair\nwill likely coalesce into a single massive galaxy. The merger, occurring in the\ndense core of a large-scale structure, might represent a critical event in the\nformation of a brightest cluster galaxy and the morphological transformation of\nhigh-redshift disky quiescent galaxies into early-type ellipticals.",

In our method, a diffusion\nmodel learns to directly predict the functional map, a low-dimensional\nrepresentation of a point-wise map between shapes. We use a large dataset of\nsynthetic human meshes for training and employ two steps to reduce the number\nof functional maps that need to be learned. First, the maps refer to a template\nrather than shape pairs. Second, the functional map is defined in a basis of\neigenvectors of the Laplacian, which is not unique due to sign ambiguity.\nTherefore, we introduce an unsupervised approach to select a specific basis by\ncorrecting the signs of eigenvectors based on surface features.

    "abstract": "Context: Dark patterns are user interface or other software designs that\ndeceive or manipulate users to do things they would not otherwise do. Even\nthough dark patterns have been under active research for a long time, including\nparticularly in computer science but recently also in other fields such as law,\nsystematic applied ethical assessments have generally received only a little\nattention. Objective: The present work evaluates ethical concerns in dark\npatterns and their research in software engineering and closely associated\ndisciplines. The evaluation is extended to cover not only dark patterns\nthemselves but also the research ethics and applied ethics involved in\nstudying, developing, and deploying them. Method: A scenario analysis is used\nto evaluate six theoretical dark pattern scenarios. The ethical evaluation is\ncarried out by focusing on the three main branches of normative ethics;\nutilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics. In terms of deontology, the\nevaluation is framed and restricted to the laws enacted in the European Union.\nResults: The evaluation results indicate that dark patterns are not universally\nmorally bad. That said, numerous ethical issues with practical relevance are\ndemonstrated and elaborated. Some of these may have societal consequences.\nConclusion: Dark patterns are ethically problematic but not always. Therefore,\nethical assessments are necessary. The two main theoretical concepts behind\ndark patterns, deception and manipulation, lead to various issues also in\nresearch ethics. It can be recommended that dark patterns should be evaluated\non case-by-case basis, considering all of the three main branches of normative\nethics in an evaluation. Analogous points apply to legal evaluations,\nespecially when considering that the real or perceived harms caused by dark\npatterns cover both material and non-material harms to natural persons.",

Given a group $\\Gamma$, and some\nsubset $S\\subseteq \\Gamma$, is it possible to permute $S$ as $s_1, s_2, \\ldots,\ns_d$ so that the partial products $\\prod_{1 \\leq i \\leq t} s_i$, $t\\in [d]$ are\nall distinct? Most of the progress towards this problem has been in the case\nwhen $\\Gamma$ is a cyclic group. We show that for any group $\\Gamma$ and any $S\n\\subseteq \\Gamma$, there is a permutation of $S$ where all but a vanishing\nproportion of the partial products are distinct, thereby establishing the first\nasymptotic version of Graham's conjecture under no restrictions on $\\Gamma$ or\n$S$.\n  To do so, we explore a natural connection between Graham's problem and the\nfollowing very natural question attributed to Schrijver. Given a $d$-regular\ngraph $G$ properly edge-coloured with $d$ colours, is it always possible to\nfind a rainbow path with $d-1$ edges? We settle this question asymptotically by\nshowing one can find a rainbow path of length $d - o(d)$.

The key component in these\nsystems is the indexes enabling Approximated Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS).\nHowever, in data lakes, one cannot realistically expect to build indexes for\nevery possible dataset.

We introduce a unified framework that recasts\nSAEs as solutions to a bilevel optimization problem, revealing a fundamental\nchallenge: each SAE imposes structural assumptions about how concepts are\nencoded in model representations, which in turn shapes what it can and cannot\ndetect. This means different SAEs are not interchangeable -- switching\narchitectures can expose entirely new concepts or obscure existing ones. To\nsystematically probe this effect, we evaluate SAEs across a spectrum of\nsettings: from controlled toy models that isolate key variables, to\nsemi-synthetic experiments on real model activations and finally to\nlarge-scale, naturalistic datasets. Across this progression, we examine two\nfundamental properties that real-world concepts often exhibit: heterogeneity in\nintrinsic dimensionality (some concepts are inherently low-dimensional, others\nare not) and nonlinear separability. We show that SAEs fail to recover concepts\nwhen these properties are ignored, and we design a new SAE that explicitly\nincorporates both, enabling the discovery of previously hidden concepts and\nreinforcing our theoretical insights.

Despite considerable efforts,\nsample quality issues and measurement techniques have limited the access to\ntheir intrinsic physics. Here, by utilizing high-purity CsPbBr3 single crystals\nand contact-free transient grating spectroscopy, we directly monitor exciton\ndiffusive transport from 26 to 300 K. As the temperature (T) increases, the\ncarrier mobility ({\\mu}) decreases rapidly below 100 K wtih a {\\mu}~T^{-3.0}\nscaling, and then follows a more gradual {\\mu}~T^{-1.7} trend at higher\ntemperatures. First-principles calculations perfectly reproduce this\nexperimental trend and reveal that optical phonon scattering governs carrier\nmobility shifts over the entire temperature range, with a single longitudinal\noptical mode dominating room-temperature transport. Time-resolved\nphotoluminescence further identifies a substantial increase in exciton\nradiative lifetime with temperature, attributed to increased exciton population\nin momentum-dark states caused by phonon scattering. Our findings unambiguously\nresolve previous theory-experiment discrepancies, providing benchmarks for\nfuture optoelectronic design.",

By using origin-destination matrices from Location-Based\nServices data in Colombia, India, and Mexico, we delineate urban and rural\nboundaries through network percolation, reducing reliance on conventional\nurbanisation metrics tied to the built environment. We gauge mobility dynamics\nacross regions developing a measure for routing inefficiency, which measures\nhow much longer empirical trips are than their optimal shortest path. Our\nfindings reveal that rural areas experience greater inefficiencies,\nparticularly for longer trips made later in the day. At the urban level, we\ndetermine the misalignment between urban mobility efficiency and public transit\naccessibility, by measuring the difference between their respective vector\nfields. We observe that most cities experience misalignment during regular\ncommuting hours, with Colombian cities exhibiting particularly high alignment.\nMeanwhile, mobility inefficiency in rural areas are associated with their\norientation around their most proximate city. City-level analyses uncover\ndisparities in the functions of rural and urban areas, with significant\nvariations between weekdays and weekends, reflecting distinct roles in\ncommuting and access to services.

The event graph has a directed edge from an earlier to a later\nevent if they are consecutive along a train line. Events that occur at the same\nlocation do not occur at the same time. In this paper, we present a way to\nvisualize such graphs, namely time-space diagrams.

However, an\nopen question, which we address here, is what happens if width is allowed to\ngrow linearly.

We present PhishVQC, a quantum model that combines\nquantum feature maps and vari ational ansatzes such as RealAmplitude and\nEfficientSU2. The model is evaluated across two experimental setups with\nvarying dataset sizes and feature map repetitions. PhishVQC achieves a maximum\nmacro average F1-score of 0.89, showing a 22% improvement over prior studies.\nThis highlights the potential of quantum machine learning to improve phishing\ndetection accuracy. The study also notes computational challenges, with\nexecution wall times increasing as dataset size grows.",

A\nkey ingredient is the characterization of finitely generated projective\n(Leavitt path algebra) modules whose endomorphism algebras are finite\ndimensional. As a consequence of our characterization we get that any quotient\nof a Leavitt path algebra divided by its Jacobson radical is a Leavitt path\nalgebra if the coefficient field is large enough. We define a stratification\nand a parametrization of the ideal space of a Leavitt path algebra (initially\nin terms of the digraph, later algebraically) and show that a generic quotient\nof a Leavitt path algebra is a Leavitt path algebra. Contrary to most algebraic\nproperties of Leavitt path algebras, our criterion for a quotient to be\nisomorphic to a Leavitt path algebra is not independent of the field of\ncoefficients.

However, the exchange interaction in\ntwo-electron systems in the absence of a magnetic field is usually constrained\nto be non-negative $J \\geq 0$, which inhibits the construction of various\ndynamically corrected exchange-based gates. In this work, we show that negative\nexchange $J < 0$ can be realized in two-electron Si quantum dot arrays in the\nabsence of a magnetic field due to the presence of the valley degree of\nfreedom. Here, valley phase differences between dots produce a non-trivial\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field in the low-energy effective theory, which in turn\ncan lead to a negative exchange interaction. In addition, we show that this\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field can break Nagaoka ferromagnetism and be engineered\nby altering the occupancy of the dot array. Therefore, our work uncovers new\ntools for exchange-based quantum computing and a novel setting for studying\nquantum magnetism.",

To address these\nissues, we propose OFF-CLIP, a contrastive learning refinement that improves\nnormal detection by introducing an off-diagonal term loss to enhance normal\nsample clustering and applying sentence-level text filtering to mitigate FNs by\nremoving misaligned normal statements from abnormal reports. OFF-CLIP can be\napplied to radiology CLIP models without requiring any architectural\nmodifications. Experimental results show that OFF-CLIP significantly improves\nnormal classification, achieving a 0.61 Area under the curve (AUC) increase on\nVinDr-CXR over CARZero, the state-of-the-art zero-shot classification baseline,\nwhile maintaining or improving abnormal classification performance.\nAdditionally, OFF-CLIP enhances zero-shot grounding by improving pointing game\naccuracy, confirming better anomaly localization.

Within these bands, the angular response of the telescope (beam) is\nconvolved with the instrument's spectral response (commonly called bandpass)\nand the signal from the sky, which leads to the band-averaged telescope beam\nresponse, which is sampled and digitized. The spectral properties of the\nband-averaged beam depend on the natural variation of the beam within the band,\nreferred to as beam chromaticity. In this paper, we quantify the impact of the\ninterplay of beam chromaticity and intrinsic frequency scaling from the various\ncomponents that dominate the polarized sky emission on the tensor-to-scalar\nratio, $r$, and foreground parameters. We do so by employing a parametric\npower-spectrum-based foreground component separation algorithm, namely BBPower,\nto which we provide beam-convolved time domain simulations performed with the\nbeamconv software while assuming an idealized version of the SO SAT optics. We\nfind a small, $0.02\\sigma$, bias on $r$, due to beam chromaticity, which seems\nto mostly impact the dust spatial parameters, causing a maximum $0.77 \\sigma$\nbias on the dust $B$-mode spectra amplitude, $A_{d}$, when employing Gaussian\nforeground simulations. However, we find all parameter biases to be smaller\nthan $1\\sigma$ at all times, independently of the foreground model.

Flash loan attacks, in particular, pose a major threat to\nDeFi protocols that hold a Total Value Locked (TVL) exceeding \\$106 billion.\nThese attacks use the atomicity property of blockchains to drain funds from\nsmart contracts in a single transaction. While existing research primarily\nfocuses on price manipulation attacks, such as oracle manipulation, mitigating\nnon-price flash loan attacks that often exploit smart contracts' zero-day\nvulnerabilities remains largely unaddressed. These attacks are challenging to\ndetect because of their unique patterns, time sensitivity, and complexity. In\nthis paper, we present FlashGuard, a runtime detection and mitigation method\nfor non-price flash loan attacks. Our approach targets smart contract function\nsignatures to identify attacks in real-time and counterattack by disrupting the\nattack transaction atomicity by leveraging the short window when transactions\nare visible in the mempool but not yet confirmed. When FlashGuard detects an\nattack, it dispatches a stealthy dusting counterattack transaction to miners to\nchange the victim contract's state which disrupts the attack's atomicity and\nforces the attack transaction to revert. We evaluate our approach using 20\nhistorical attacks and several unseen attacks. FlashGuard achieves an average\nreal-time detection latency of 150.31ms, a detection accuracy of over 99.93\\%,\nand an average disruption time of 410.92ms.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in Large Reasoning Models like OpenAI o1\nlearns from feedback on its answers, which is especially useful in applications\nwhen fine-tuning data is scarce. Recent open-source work like DeepSeek-R1\ndemonstrates that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward is one key\ndirection in reproducing o1. While the R1-style model has demonstrated success\nin language models, its application in multi-modal domains remains\nunder-explored. This work introduces Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning\n(Visual-RFT), which further extends the application areas of RFT on visual\ntasks. Specifically, Visual-RFT first uses Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)\nto generate multiple responses containing reasoning tokens and final answers\nfor each input, and then uses our proposed visual perception verifiable reward\nfunctions to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm such as\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We design different verifiable\nreward functions for different perception tasks, such as the Intersection over\nUnion (IoU) reward for object detection. Experimental results on fine-grained\nimage classification, few-shot object detection, reasoning grounding, as well\nas open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks show the competitive performance\nand advanced generalization ability of Visual-RFT compared with Supervised\nFine-tuning (SFT). For example, Visual-RFT improves accuracy by $24.3\\%$ over\nthe baseline in one-shot fine-grained image classification with around 100\nsamples. In few-shot object detection, Visual-RFT also exceeds the baseline by\n$21.9$ on COCO's two-shot setting and $15.4$ on LVIS. Our Visual-RFT represents\na paradigm shift in fine-tuning LVLMs, offering a data-efficient, reward-driven\napproach that enhances reasoning and adaptability for domain-specific tasks.",

This paper\nintroduces visual S-Graphs (vS-Graphs), a novel real-time VSLAM framework that\nintegrates vision-based scene understanding with map reconstruction and\ncomprehensible graph-based representation. The framework infers structural\nelements (i.e., rooms and corridors) from detected building components (i.e.,\nwalls and ground surfaces) and incorporates them into optimizable 3D scene\ngraphs. This solution enhances the reconstructed map's semantic richness,\ncomprehensibility, and localization accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard\nbenchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that vS-Graphs outperforms\nstate-of-the-art VSLAM methods, reducing trajectory error by an average of\n3.38% and up to 9.58% on real-world data.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the equilibrium effects of insurance contracts on\nhealthcare markets using a mechanism design framework. A population of\nrisk-averse agents with preferences as in Yaari (1987) face the risk of\ndeveloping an illness of unknown severity, which can be treated in a\ncompetitive hospital services market at the prevailing market price. After\nprivately observing their health risk, but before learning their sickness\nlevel, agents have the option to purchase insurance from a monopolistic\nprovider. Insurance contracts specify premiums, out-of-pocket costs (OPCs), and\nhospital service coverage, thus determining demand and price in the downstream\nhospital market through a market-clearing condition. Our first main result\nshows that optimal insurance contracts take a simple form: agents can choose\nbetween full hospital coverage with a high OPC or restricted coverage with a\nlow OPC. This highlights a novel form of under-insurance (rationing or\nrestricted access to healthcare services) emerging purely due to the insurer's\nattempt to control his price impact. Our second key result illustrates the\nnuanced effect of price impact on the amount of insurance provided. Higher\nhealthcare prices increase insurer payouts but also worsen agents' outside\noptions, making them more willing to pay for insurance ex ante. The net effect\nof these forces determines whether insurance provision exceeds or falls short\nof a price-taking benchmark.",

The long-time stability is further enhanced by the\nHurwitz matrix decomposition that constrains the spectrum of the linear\noperator, therefore stabilizing the linearized dynamics. When combined with a\nLipschitz-controlled neural network treatment for the nonlinear operator, we\nshow the nonlinear dynamics of the NODE are provably stable near a fixed point\nin the sense of Lyapunov. For high-dimensional data, we further rely on an\nautoencoder performing dimensionality reduction and Higham's algorithm for the\nmatrix-free application of the matrix exponential on a vector. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed NODE approach in various examples, including\nthe Robertson chemical reaction problem and the Kuramoto-Sivashinky equation.",

However, achieving photorealistic\nrendering from extreme novel viewpoints remains challenging, as artifacts\npersist across representations. In this work, we introduce Difix3D+, a novel\npipeline designed to enhance 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis through\nsingle-step diffusion models. At the core of our approach is Difix, a\nsingle-step image diffusion model trained to enhance and remove artifacts in\nrendered novel views caused by underconstrained regions of the 3D\nrepresentation. Difix serves two critical roles in our pipeline. First, it is\nused during the reconstruction phase to clean up pseudo-training views that are\nrendered from the reconstruction and then distilled back into 3D. This greatly\nenhances underconstrained regions and improves the overall 3D representation\nquality. More importantly, Difix also acts as a neural enhancer during\ninference, effectively removing residual artifacts arising from imperfect 3D\nsupervision and the limited capacity of current reconstruction models. Difix3D+\nis a general solution, a single model compatible with both NeRF and 3DGS\nrepresentations, and it achieves an average 2$\\times$ improvement in FID score\nover baselines while maintaining 3D consistency.",

In\nthis article, we modify the usual search problem by adding an extra trapping\nvertex to the graph, which is only connected to the target element. We study\nthe transfer efficiency of the walker to a trapping site, using the search\nproblem as a case study. Thus, our model offers no computational advantage for\nthe search problem, but focuses on information transport in an open environment\nwith a search Hamiltonian. The walker evolution is a mix between classical and\nquantum walk search dynamics. The balance between unitary and non-unitary\ndynamics is tuned with a parameter, and we numerically show that depending on\nthe graph topology and the connectivity of the target element, this hybrid\napproach can outperform a purely classical or quantum evolution for reaching\nthe trapping site. We show that this behavior is only observed in the presence\nof an extra trapping site, and that depending on the topology, the increase of\nnon-unitary operations can be compensated by increasing the strength of the\nquantum walk exploration. This compensation comes at the cost of reducing or\neven suppressing the searching feature of the evolution. In that case, the\nunitary dynamics will only induce a regular quantum walk behavior. We also\nrelate the optimal hybrid regime to the entropy's decay rate. As the\nintroduction of non-unitary operations may be considered as noise, we interpret\nthis phenomena as a noisy-assisted quantum evolution.",

The\nprotocols involve detailed guidelines to delineate the entire claustrum,\nincluding the inferior parts that have not been clearly described in earlier\nMRI studies. Additionally, we propose a geometric method to parcellate the\nclaustrum into three subregions (the dorsal, ventral, and temporal claustrum)\nalong the superior-to-inferior axis. The mean bilateral claustrum volume in 10\nyoung adults was 3307.5 mm^3, approximately 0.21% of total intracranial volume.\nOur segmentation protocol demonstrated high inter- and intra-rater reliability\n(ICC > 0.89, DSC > 0.85), confirming its replicability. This comprehensive and\nreliable manual segmentation protocol offers a robust foundation for\nanatomically precise neuroimaging investigations of the human claustrum.",

The data show\nthat the buffer layer formation goes along with a simultaneous SiC\ndecomposition which takes place as a rapid step retraction of one specific type\nof SiC bilayer in good agreement with the step retraction model. Once the\nbuffer layer coverage is completed, the resulting characteristic regular\nrepeating terrace and step height pattern of one and two SiC bilayers turned\nout to be very stable against further SiC decomposition. The following initial\ngrowth of monolayer graphene domains occurs, interestingly, only along the two\nbilayer high terrace edges.

The two exceptions are c-C$_3$H$_2$, which is enhanced by a factor of\n\\about 25 with respect to cyanopolyynes in the Chamaeleon cores, and ammonia,\nwhich is enhanced by a factor of ~ 125. The deuterated species c-C$_3$HD is\ndetected in both cores, with a high D/H ratio of ~0.23 in c-C$_3$H$_2$. A rare\nisotopologue of ammonia, $^{15}$NH$_3$, is also detected in Cha-MMS1 suggesting\na high $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio of ~ 690 in ammonia.

We use the detections of\nammonia, cyanopolyynes, and far-infrared dust continuum to characterize the\ndensity and temperature in the Chamaeleon cores and calculate the molecular\ncolumn densities and their relative ratios. The ring molecule benzonitrile is\nnot detected in either Chamaeleon core.

Various physiological and behavioural modalities have been\nexplored for this purpose, with Electrocardiogram (ECG) emerging as a standout\nchoice for real-time emotion monitoring, particularly in dynamic and\nunpredictable driving conditions. Existing methods, however, often rely on\nmulti-channel ECG signals recorded under static conditions, limiting their\napplicability in real-world dynamic driving scenarios. To address this\nlimitation, the paper introduces ECG-EmotionNet, a novel architecture designed\nspecifically for emotion recognition in dynamic driving environments.\nECG-EmotionNet is constructed by adapting a recently introduced ECG Foundation\nModel (FM) and uniquely employs single-channel ECG signals, ensuring both\nrobust generalizability and computational efficiency. Unlike conventional\nadaptation methods such as full fine-tuning, linear probing, or low-rank\nadaptation, we propose an intuitively pleasing alternative, referred to as the\nnested Mixture of Experts (MoE) adaptation. More precisely, each transformer\nlayer of the underlying FM is treated as a separate expert, with embeddings\nextracted from these experts fused using trainable weights within a gating\nmechanism. This approach enhances the representation of both global and local\nECG features, leading to a 6% improvement in accuracy and a 7% increase in the\nF1 score, all while maintaining computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Regular transductions over finite words have linear input-to-output growth.\nThis class of transductions enjoys many characterizations. Recently, regular\ntransductions have been extended by Boja\\'nczyk to polyregular transductions,\nwhich have polynomial growth, and are characterized by pebble transducers and\nMSO interpretations. Another class of interest is that of transductions defined\nby streaming string transducers or marble transducers, which have exponential\ngrowth and are incomparable with polyregular transductions.\n  In this paper, we consider MSO set interpretations (MSOSI) over finite words\nwhich were introduced by Colcombet and Loeding. MSOSI are a natural candidate\nfor the class of \"regular transductions with exponential growth\", and are\nrather well-behaved. However MSOSI lack, for now, two desirable properties that\nregular and polyregular transductions have. The first property is being\ndescribed by an automaton model, which is closely related to the second\nproperty of regularity preserving meaning preserving regular languages under\ninverse image. We first show that if MSOSI are (effectively) regularity\npreserving then any automatic $\\omega$-word has a decidable MSO theory, an\nalmost 20 years old conjecture of B\\'ar\\'any.\n  Our main contribution is the introduction of a class of transductions of\nexponential growth, which we call lexicographic transductions. We provide three\ndifferent presentations for this class: 1) as the closure of simple\ntransductions (recognizable transductions) under a single operator called\nmaplex; 2) as a syntactic fragment of MSOSI (but the regular languages are\ngiven by automata instead of formulas); 3) we give an automaton based model\ncalled nested marble transducers, which generalize both marble transducers and\npebble transducers. We show that this class enjoys many nice properties\nincluding being regularity preserving.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that circumstellar disks exhibit weak turbulence,\nwith their dynamics and evolution being primarily influenced by magnetic winds.\nHowever, most numerical studies have focused on planet-disk interactions in\nturbulent disk models. We aim to explore how wind-driven accretion affects the\norbital and eccentricity evolution of a Jovian planet within a magnetized disk.\nConversely, we seek to determine in what extent such a planet can modify the\naccretion behavior and the wind dynamics. We perform high-resolution 3D global\nnon-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a massive gap-carving\nplanet interacting with a wind-launching disk, using the accelerated code\nIDEFIX. We consider the influence of the gap shape on planet migration by\nrestarting a \"fixed-planet\" simulation at three different times, from which the\nplanet evolves freely in the disk. For a strong initial magnetization and a\nsufficiently deep planet gap, we find that the planet becomes moderately\neccentric, and its migration is slow, unsteady and mostly outward. This\nmigration pattern is due to the gap's radial asymmetry which enhances the inner\nLindblad torque while reducing the outer Lindblad torque. We show that\neccentricity can grow up to 6-8% and is likely driven by a finite-amplitude\ninstability triggered by first-order external Lindblad resonances. These\nmoderate eccentricity values periodically modulate the gap accretion rate and\nwind mass loss rate, possibly leading to the formation of discrete structures\nin CO outflows. Slow outward migration and eccentricity growth appear to be\ncommon outcomes of planet-disk-wind interactions, which may contribute\nsignificantly to both the long orbital periods and the moderate eccentricities\nof warm jupiters. Additionally, eccentric massive protoplanets embedded in\ncircumstellar disks could play a role in generating structured outflows.",

The performance of\ncombining the PLVA with AIS post processing including the CRC is studied with\ntwo detectors, one coherent and the other differential, in two channel models:\na single-user AWGN channel and a more realistic multiple-access AIS channel.

Phi-4-Mini is a 3.8-billion-parameter language\nmodel trained on high-quality web and synthetic data, significantly\noutperforming recent open-source models of similar size and matching the\nperformance of models twice its size on math and coding tasks requiring complex\nreasoning. This achievement is driven by a carefully curated synthetic data\nrecipe emphasizing high-quality math and coding datasets. Compared to its\npredecessor, Phi-3.5-Mini, Phi-4-Mini features an expanded vocabulary size of\n200K tokens to better support multilingual applications, as well as group query\nattention for more efficient long-sequence generation. Phi-4-Multimodal is a\nmultimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input\nmodalities into a single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages\nLoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes\ncombining various modalities without interference. For example, it now ranks\nfirst in the OpenASR leaderboard to date, although the LoRA component of the\nspeech/audio modality has just 460 million parameters. Phi-4-Multimodal\nsupports scenarios involving (vision + language), (vision + speech), and\n(speech/audio) inputs, outperforming larger vision-language and speech-language\nmodels on a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we experiment to further train\nPhi-4-Mini to enhance its reasoning capabilities. Despite its compact\n3.8-billion-parameter size, this experimental version achieves reasoning\nperformance on par with or surpassing significantly larger models, including\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.",

Both\n$\\text{O}_{\\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\\text{O}_{\\text{i}}^{2-}$ present the fastest\ndiffusion along the $b$-axis, demonstrating significant anisotropy. The\npredicted self-diffusivities along [100] and [$\\overline{2}01$] align well with\npreviously reported values from isotopically labeled oxygen tracer experiments,\nhighlighting the reliability of the approach in capturing complex diffusion\nmechanisms.",

In this paper, we demonstrate\nhow RL can be applied to adversarial machine learning (AML) to develop a new\nclass of attacks that learn to generate adversarial examples: inputs designed\nto fool machine learning models. Unlike traditional AML methods that craft\nadversarial examples independently, our RL-based approach retains and exploits\npast attack experience to improve future attacks. We formulate adversarial\nexample generation as a Markov Decision Process and evaluate RL's ability to\n(a) learn effective and efficient attack strategies and (b) compete with\nstate-of-the-art AML. On CIFAR-10, our agent increases the success rate of\nadversarial examples by 19.4% and decreases the median number of victim model\nqueries per adversarial example by 53.2% from the start to the end of training.\nIn a head-to-head comparison with a state-of-the-art image attack,\nSquareAttack, our approach enables an adversary to generate adversarial\nexamples with 13.1% more success after 5000 episodes of training. From a\nsecurity perspective, this work demonstrates a powerful new attack vector that\nuses RL to attack ML models efficiently and at scale.",

The proposed framework distills a large teacher\nmodel into progressively smaller student models, designed using Mamba blocks.\nEach student model is trained using Selective-State-Space Models (S-SSM) within\nthe Mamba blocks, focusing on important input aspects while reducing\ncomputational complexity. The work's preliminary experiments use MNIST and\nCIFAR-10 as datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. For\nMNIST, the teacher model achieves 98% accuracy. A set of seven student models\nas a group retained 63% of the teacher's FLOPs, approximating the teacher's\nperformance with 98% accuracy. The weak student used only 1% of the teacher's\nFLOPs and maintained 72% accuracy. Similarly, for CIFAR-10, the students\nachieved 1% less accuracy compared to the teacher, with the small student\nretaining 5% of the teacher's FLOPs to achieve 50% accuracy.

We presently prove that lower dimensional\nembeddings are possible when using Euclidean metric embeddings as opposed to\nvector-based Logistic PCA (LPCA) embeddings. In particular, we provide an\nefficient logarithmic search procedure for identifying the exact embedding\ndimension and demonstrate how metric embeddings enable inference of the exact\nembedding dimensions of large-scale networks by exploiting that the metric\nproperties can be used to provide linearithmic scaling. Empirically, we show\nthat our approach extracts substantially lower dimensional representations of\nnetworks than previously reported for small-sized networks.

Peer\neffect refers to the difference in counterfactual outcomes of an individual for\ndifferent levels of peer exposure, the extent to which an individual is exposed\nto the treatments, actions, or behaviors of peers. Estimating peer effects\nrequires deciding how to represent peer exposure. Typically, researchers define\nan exposure mapping function that aggregates peer treatments and outputs peer\nexposure. Most existing approaches for defining exposure mapping functions\nassume peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers. Recent\nstudies have investigated more complex functions of peer exposure which capture\nthat different peers can exert different degrees of influence. However, none of\nthese works have explicitly considered the problem of automatically learning\nthe exposure mapping function. In this work, we focus on learning this function\nfor the purpose of estimating heterogeneous peer effects, where heterogeneity\nrefers to the variation in counterfactual outcomes for the same peer exposure\nbut different individual's contexts. We develop EgoNetGNN, a graph neural\nnetwork (GNN)-based method, to automatically learn the appropriate exposure\nmapping function allowing for complex peer influence mechanisms that, in\naddition to peer treatments, can involve the local neighborhood structure and\nedge attributes. We show that GNN models that use peer exposure based on the\nnumber or fraction of treated peers or learn peer exposure naively face\ndifficulty accounting for such influence mechanisms. Our comprehensive\nevaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network data shows that our method\nis more robust to different unknown underlying influence mechanisms when\nestimating heterogeneous peer effects when compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "Deep generative models have recently achieved significant success in modeling\ngraph data, including dynamic graphs, where topology and features evolve over\ntime. However, unlike in vision and natural language domains, evaluating\ngenerative models for dynamic graphs is challenging due to the difficulty of\nvisualizing their output, making quantitative metrics essential. In this work,\nwe develop a new quality metric for evaluating generative models of dynamic\ngraphs. Current metrics for dynamic graphs typically involve discretizing the\ncontinuous-evolution of graphs into static snapshots and then applying\nconventional graph similarity measures. This approach has several limitations:\n(a) it models temporally related events as i.i.d. samples, failing to capture\nthe non-uniform evolution of dynamic graphs; (b) it lacks a unified measure\nthat is sensitive to both features and topology; (c) it fails to provide a\nscalar metric, requiring multiple metrics without clear superiority; and (d) it\nrequires explicitly instantiating each static snapshot, leading to impractical\nruntime demands that hinder evaluation at scale. We propose a novel metric\nbased on the \\textit{Johnson-Lindenstrauss} lemma, applying random projections\ndirectly to dynamic graph data. This results in an expressive, scalar, and\napplication-agnostic measure of dynamic graph similarity that overcomes the\nlimitations of traditional methods. We also provide a comprehensive empirical\nevaluation of metrics for continuous-time dynamic graphs, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of our approach compared to existing methods.

To investigate this, we conduct controlled\nexperiments to analyze the roles of word form and contextual information in\nsemantic reconstruction and examine LLM attention patterns. Specifically, we\nfirst propose SemRecScore, a reliable metric to quantify the degree of semantic\nreconstruction, and validate its effectiveness. Using this metric, we study how\nword form and contextual information influence LLMs' semantic reconstruction\nability, identifying word form as the core factor in this process. Furthermore,\nwe analyze how LLMs utilize word form and find that they rely on specialized\nattention heads to extract and process word form information, with this\nmechanism remaining stable across varying levels of word scrambling. This\ndistinction between LLMs' fixed attention patterns primarily focused on word\nform and human readers' adaptive strategy in balancing word form and contextual\ninformation provides insights into enhancing LLM performance by incorporating\nhuman-like, context-aware mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency\nin conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus.\nNonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These\nfailures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language\nModels (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of\ninaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods\nsegment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find\nrelevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the\nsegments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer\ncontext retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved.\n  In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these\nlimitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering\nsemantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is\ntrained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to\nensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant\nones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select\nchunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more\nrelevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved\nchunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive\nor lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show\nthat SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average.\nMoreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the\ntokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost\nefficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for\nboosting RAG.",

    "abstract": "Most microeconomic models of interest involve optimizing a piecewise linear\nfunction. These include contract design in hidden-action principal-agent\nproblems, selling an item in posted-price auctions, and bidding in first-price\nauctions. When the relevant model parameters are unknown and determined by some\n(unknown) probability distributions, the problem becomes learning how to\noptimize an unknown and stochastic piecewise linear reward function. Such a\nproblem is usually framed within an online learning framework, where the\ndecision-maker (learner) seeks to minimize the regret of not knowing an optimal\ndecision in hindsight. This paper introduces a general online learning\nframework that offers a unified approach to tackle regret minimization for\npiecewise linear rewards, under a suitable monotonicity assumption commonly\nsatisfied by microeconomic models. We design a learning algorithm that attains\na regret of $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{nT})$, where $n$ is the number of ``pieces''\nof the reward function and $T$ is the number of rounds. This result is tight\nwhen $n$ is \\emph{small} relative to $T$, specifically when $n \\leq T^{1/3}$.\nOur algorithm solves two open problems in the literature on learning in\nmicroeconomic settings. First, it shows that the $\\widetilde{O}(T^{2/3})$\nregret bound obtained by Zhu et al. [Zhu+23] for learning optimal linear\ncontracts in hidden-action principal-agent problems is not tight when the\nnumber of agent's actions is small relative to $T$. Second, our algorithm\ndemonstrates that, in the problem of learning to set prices in posted-price\nauctions, it is possible to attain suitable (and desirable)\ninstance-independent regret bounds, addressing an open problem posed by\nCesa-Bianchi et al.

This leads to nearly optimal\nTucker rank parameters which are close to the results for well established\nTucker-ALS algorithm applied to the large grid-based tensors.

    "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) is one of the most important interstellar molecules.\nWhile it is considered that it forms on the surface of interstellar dust\ngrains, the exact contribution of different chemical mechanisms is still poorly\nconstrained. Traditionally it is deemed that the CO + OH reaction occurring on\ntop of ices is the main reaction path for its formation. Recent investigations\nshowed that in reality the reaction presents a more complex mechanism,\nrequiring an additional H-abstraction step. Building on our previous works, we\ncarried out a detailed investigation of such H abstraction reactions with the\nhydrogen atom as a reactant for the abstraction reaction. We found an\nunconventional chemistry for this reaction, markedly depending on the isomeric\nform of the HOCO radical prior to reaction. The favored reactions are t-HOCO +\nH -> CO + H$_2$O, c-HOCO + H -> CO$_2$ + H$_2$ and t/c-HOCO + H -> c/t-HCOOH.\nWe estimate bounds for the rate constants of the less favored reaction\nchannels, t-HOCO + H -> CO$_2$ + H and c-HOCO + H -> CO + H$_2$O, to be\napproximately 10$^{4-6}$ s$^{-1}$. However, these estimates should be\ninterpreted cautiously due to the significant role of quantum tunneling in\nthese reactions and the complex electronic structure of the involved molecules,\nwhich complicates their study. Our findings underscore the need for detailed\ninvestigation into the chemistry of interstellar CO$_2$ and pave the way for a\nreevaluation of its primary formation mechanisms in the interstellar medium.",

    "abstract": "Chiral semiconductors such as elemental tellurium (Te) exhibit unconventional\nspin textures and large charge-to-spin conversion efficiencies, yet the\ninfluence of introducing elements on these properties remains underexplored.\nHere, we address this gap by investigating how substituting Te with lighter (S,\nSe) or heavier (Sb) elements systematically modifies the spin-orbit-driven\nphenomena in chiral Te, including the band structure, spin Berry curvature, and\nRashba-Edelstein response. The objective is to determine whether elemental\nsubstitution strategies can be leveraged to optimize collinear spin textures,\nenhance spin accumulation, and possibly extend spin lifetimes all crucial\naspects for magnet-free spintronics. Using density functional theory\ncalculations implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO, combined with tight-binding\ninterpolation in PAOFLOW, we map out the element-dependent electronic states\nand quantify their associated spin transport coefficients. Our findings reveal\nthat lighter elements shift the Fermi level to regions of pronounced spin\nsplitting, thereby increasing the magnitude of spin-current conversion, whereas\nheavier elements can introduce or remove near-degenerate bands that strongly\naffect spin-orbit coupling. In both scenarios, the fundamental chirality of Te\nremains robust, preserving the radial or ''collinear'' spin-momentum locking.\nThese results not only confirm that introducing elements is a potent and\nfeasible route for tuning spin-orbit phenomena but also offer practical\nguidelines for experimental efforts aiming to engineer chiral semiconductors\nfor spin devices.

Using\nUV visible spectroscopy, phase diagrams, and quartz crystal microbalance with\ndissipation monitoring (QCM-D), the bulk phase behavior and adsorption\ncharacteristics of CHI-APG mixtures on negatively charged surfaces was studied.\nResults demonstrate that APG concentration controls the phase behavior, with\nmoderate levels inducing coacervate formation, while higher ionic strengths\npromote this coacervation through enhanced hydrogen bonding interactions.

We theoretically investigate the prospects of\nsuch interferometry to probe the statistics of point-like anyonic excitations\ninjected in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) setup based on a quantum point contact\ndevice in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We compute the standard HOM\nratio, i.e., the ratio of tunneling noises for two- and one-particle\ninjections, and find that for point-like anyons, it only depends on the\ntemperature and the anyon scaling dimension. Importantly, the latter is not\nnecessarily related to the exchange phase. In fact, we establish that the HOM\nratio does not reveal the exchange phase of the injected anyons: For\ninjection-time delays that are small compared to the thermal time scale, we\nfind that the exchange phase accumulated due to time-domain braiding between\ninjected and thermally activated anyons is erased due to two mutually canceling\nsub-processes. In contrast, for time delays large compared to the thermal time,\nonly a single sub-process contributes to the braiding, but the accumulated\nphase is canceled in the HOM ratio.

PML, inspired by human motor learning, emphasizes\nthe seamless integration of perception and action, enabling efficient\ndecision-making in dynamic environments. Traditional autonomous driving\napproaches--including modular pipelines, imitation learning, and reinforcement\nlearning--struggle with adaptability, generalization, and computational\nefficiency. In contrast, PML with AIF leverages a generative model to minimize\nprediction error (\"surprise\") and actively shape vehicle control based on\nlearned perceptual-motor representations. Our approach unifies deep learning\nwith active inference principles, allowing HAVs to perform lane-keeping\nmaneuvers with minimal data and without extensive retraining across different\nenvironments. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that PML\nwith AIF enhances adaptability without increasing computational overhead while\nachieving performance comparable to conventional methods. These findings\nhighlight the potential of PML-driven active inference as a robust alternative\nfor real-world autonomous driving applications.",

    "abstract": "Formal languages are an integral part of modeling and simulation. They allow\nthe distillation of knowledge into concise simulation models amenable to\nautomatic execution, interpretation, and analysis. However, the arguably most\nhumanly accessible means of expressing models is through natural language,\nwhich is not easily interpretable by computers. Here, we evaluate how a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) might be used for formalizing natural language into\nsimulation models. Existing studies only explored using very large LLMs, like\nthe commercial GPT models, without fine-tuning model weights. To close this\ngap, we show how an open-weights, 7B-parameter Mistral model can be fine-tuned\nto translate natural language descriptions to reaction network models in a\ndomain-specific language, offering a self-hostable, compute-, and memory\nefficient alternative. To this end, we develop a synthetic data generator to\nserve as the basis for fine-tuning and evaluation. Our quantitative evaluation\nshows that our fine-tuned Mistral model can recover the ground truth simulation\nmodel in up to 84.5% of cases. In addition, our small-scale user study\ndemonstrates the model's practical potential for one-time generation as well as\ninteractive modeling in various domains. While promising, in its current form,\nthe fine-tuned small LLM cannot catch up with large LLMs. We conclude that\nhigher-quality training data are required, and expect future small and\nopen-source LLMs to offer new opportunities.",

The same signal, with lower significance, is also observed in the\nwide-field protocluster structures, indicating an accelerated evolution of\ngalaxies before their infall into massive halos. Our simulations underestimate\nSFRs of galaxies both in protoclusters and in the box, compared to\nobservations, due to low gas reservoirs. We find a weak suppression of SFRs in\nprotocluster galaxies (~0.05 dex), compared to the box, increasing up to ~0.25\ndex in massive halos. The quenched galaxy fraction varies significantly across\ndifferent protocluster halos, consistent with observations. The simulations\nshow a strong dependence of quenched fractions on halo mass and an excess of\nquenched galaxies in the wide-field protocluster region, compared to the\ncosmological box.

    "abstract": "DUSt3R introduced a novel paradigm in geometric computer vision by proposing\na model that can provide dense and unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction of\narbitrary image collections with no prior information about camera calibration\nnor viewpoint poses. Under the hood, however, DUSt3R processes image pairs,\nregressing local 3D reconstructions that need to be aligned in a global\ncoordinate system. The number of pairs, growing quadratically, is an inherent\nlimitation that becomes especially concerning for robust and fast optimization\nin the case of large image collections. In this paper, we propose an extension\nof DUSt3R from pairs to multiple views, that addresses all aforementioned\nconcerns. Indeed, we propose a Multi-view Network for Stereo 3D Reconstruction,\nor MUSt3R, that modifies the DUSt3R architecture by making it symmetric and\nextending it to directly predict 3D structure for all views in a common\ncoordinate frame. Second, we entail the model with a multi-layer memory\nmechanism which allows to reduce the computational complexity and to scale the\nreconstruction to large collections, inferring thousands of 3D pointmaps at\nhigh frame-rates with limited added complexity. The framework is designed to\nperform 3D reconstruction both offline and online, and hence can be seamlessly\napplied to SfM and visual SLAM scenarios showing state-of-the-art performance\non various 3D downstream tasks, including uncalibrated Visual Odometry,\nrelative camera pose, scale and focal estimation, 3D reconstruction and\nmulti-view depth estimation.",

The outer region of PPDs is likely subject\nto the vertical shear instability (VSI), representing a major source of disk\nturbulence characterized by vertical corrugation that leads to strong dust\nstirring. In the meantime, the VSI turbulence in 3D generates vortices through\nthe Rossby wave instability (RWI), which can trap dust and thereby promote dust\nconcentration. In this study, we use the multifluid dust module in Athena++ to\nconduct 2D axisymmetric global simulations of PPDs with mesh refinement and 3D\nglobal simulations with modest resolution. In 2D, the VSI corrugation mode is\nweakened by dust back-reaction, while the SI can still survive regardless of\ninitial conditions. Dust clumping occurs and is seeded by VSI-induced zonal\nflows. In 3D, dust can settle even more with increased dusty buoyancy,\nsuppressing the VSI corrugation mode. Meanwhile, dust back-reaction enhances\ndust concentration in RWI vortices, though higher resolution is needed to\nassess dust clumping.",

To address these issues, we\npropose OpenGS-SLAM, an innovative framework that utilizes 3D Gaussian\nrepresentation to perform dense semantic SLAM in open-set environments.

Additionally, we propose a Confidence-based\n2D Label Consensus method to ensure consistent labeling across multiple views.\nFurthermore, we employ a Segmentation Counter Pruning strategy to improve the\naccuracy of semantic scene representation. Extensive experiments on both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method\nin scene understanding, tracking, and mapping, achieving 10 times faster\nsemantic rendering and 2 times lower storage costs compared to existing\nmethods.

We show that many of the DFAs are extremely sensitive to the\nnumerical integration grid used, and note that the choice of DC is not\nindependent of the DFA. Functionals with many empirical parameters tuned for\nmain-group thermochemistry do not necessarily result in a reasonable PES, while\nimproved performance can be obtained using nearly dispersionless DFAs with very\nfew empirical parameters and allowing the DC to compensate.

Large language\nmodels (LLMs) could assist this activity via their generative capability.\nHowever, it is not clear whether they can help designers produce high-quality\nframes. Therefore, we asked if there are benefits to working with LLMs. To this\nend, we compared three ways of using LLMs (N=280): 1) free-form, 2) direct\ngeneration, and 3) a structured approach informed by a theory of reframing. We\nfound that using LLMs does not help improve the quality of problem frames. In\nfact, it increases the competence gap between experienced and inexperienced\ndesigners.

This paper\naddresses this gap by proposing a philosophical account of technological\nunderstanding - the type of understanding that is required for and reflected by\nsuccessfully designing and using technological artefacts. We develop this\nnotion by building on the concept of scientific understanding. Drawing on\nparallels between science and technology, and specifically between scientific\ntheories and technological artefacts, we extend the idea of scientific\nunderstanding into the realm of technology. We argue that, just as scientific\nunderstanding involves the ability to explain a phenomenon using a theory,\ntechnological understanding involves the ability to use a technological\nartefact to realise a practical aim. Technological understanding can thus be\nconsidered a specific application of knowledge: it encompasses the cognitive\nskill of recognising how a practical aim can be achieved by using a\ntechnological artefact. In a context of design, this general notion of\ntechnological understanding is specified as the ability to design an artefact\nthat, by producing a phenomenon through its physical structure, achieves the\nintended aim. We illustrate our concept of technological understanding through\ntwo running examples: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and superconducting\nquantum computers. Our account highlights the epistemic dimension of engaging\nwith technology and, by allowing for context-dependent specifications, provides\nguidance for testing and improving technological understanding in specific\ncontexts.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces RoboDexVLM, an innovative framework for robot task\nplanning and grasp detection tailored for a collaborative manipulator equipped\nwith a dexterous hand. Previous methods focus on simplified and limited\nmanipulation tasks, which often neglect the complexities associated with\ngrasping a diverse array of objects in a long-horizon manner. In contrast, our\nproposed framework utilizes a dexterous hand capable of grasping objects of\nvarying shapes and sizes while executing tasks based on natural language\ncommands. The proposed approach has the following core components: First, a\nrobust task planner with a task-level recovery mechanism that leverages\nvision-language models (VLMs) is designed, which enables the system to\ninterpret and execute open-vocabulary commands for long sequence tasks. Second,\na language-guided dexterous grasp perception algorithm is presented based on\nrobot kinematics and formal methods, tailored for zero-shot dexterous\nmanipulation with diverse objects and commands. Comprehensive experimental\nresults validate the effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness of RoboDexVLM\nin handling long-horizon scenarios and performing dexterous grasping. These\nresults highlight the framework's ability to operate in complex environments,\nshowcasing its potential for open-vocabulary dexterous manipulation.

    "abstract": "Recently, bipath persistent homology has been proposed as an extension of\nstandard persistent homology, along with its visualization (bipath persistence\ndiagram) and computational methods. In the setting of standard persistent\nhomology, the stability theorem with respect to real-valued functions on a\ntopological space is one of the fundamental results, which gives a mathematical\njustification for using persistent homology to noisy data. In proving the\nstability theorem, the algebraic stability theorem/the isometry theorem for\npersistence modules plays a central role. In this point of view, the stability\nproperty for bipath persistent homology is desired for analyzing data. In this\npaper, we prove the stability theorem of bipath persistent homology with\nrespect to bipath functions on a topological space. This theorem suggests a\nstability of bipath persistence diagrams: small changes in a bipath function\n(except at their ends) result in only small changes in the bipath persistence\ndiagram. Similar to the stability theorem of standard persistent homology, we\ndeduce the stability theorem of bipath persistent homology by using the\nalgebraic stability theorem/the isometry theorem of bipath persistence modules.",

This paper\nintroduces a novel filtering technique for SIFT-based feature matching, known\nas the Mean and Median Distance (MMD) Filter. This method evaluates the\ndifferences in keypoint coordinates and computes the mean and median in each\ndirection to eliminate incorrect matches. Experiments conducted on the 850nm\nsubset of the CASIA dataset indicate that the proposed MMD filter effectively\npreserves correct points while reducing false positives detected by other\nfiltering methods. A comparison with existing SIFT-based palm vein recognition\nsystems demonstrates that the proposed MMD filter delivers outstanding\nperformance, achieving lower Equal Error Rate (EER) values.

Building a high-quality\navatar that supports animation with diverse poses from a monocular video is\nchallenging because the observation of pose diversity and view points is\ninherently limited. The lack of pose variations typically leads to poor\ngeneralization to novel poses, and avatars can easily overfit to limited input\nview points, producing artifacts and distortions from other views. In this\nwork, we address these limitations by leveraging a universal prior model (UPM)\nlearned from a large corpus of multi-view clothed human performance capture\ndata. We build our representation on top of expressive 3D Gaussians with\ncanonical front and back maps shared across identities. Once the UPM is learned\nto accurately reproduce the large-scale multi-view human images, we fine-tune\nthe model with an in-the-wild video via inverse rendering to obtain a\npersonalized photorealistic human avatar that can be faithfully animated to\nnovel human motions and rendered from novel views. The experiments show that\nour approach based on the learned universal prior sets a new state-of-the-art\nin monocular avatar reconstruction by substantially outperforming existing\napproaches relying only on heuristic regularization or a shape prior of\nminimally clothed bodies (e.g., SMPL) on publicly available datasets.",

    "abstract": "In this report, we look at the fundamental physics of triboelectricity,\ncharge transfer due to contact and sliding. While much of the report focuses\nupon recent advances such as the incorporation of flexoelectric contributions,\nwe also include older work, some from centuries ago, which only now can be\nunderstood in a general sense. Basic concepts and theories ranging from\nelements of tribology and contact mechanics through semiconductor built-in\npotentials, electromechanical terms, mechanochemistry and trap states are\nbriefly described, linking to established surface science and interface\nphysics. We then overview the main models that have been proposed, showing that\nthey all fall within conventional electrostatics combined with other\nestablished science. We conclude with some suggestions for the future. Based\nupon this overview, our conclusion is that triboelectricity is a slightly\ncomplex combination of standard electrostatic phenomena that can be understood\nusing the generalized Ampere's law connecting the electric displacement field\nwith both Coulomb and polarization contributions, and the free carrier density,\nthat is Grad.D=rho. Triboelectricity may be confusing, it is not really\nconfused if care is taken, but it is complex.",

Specifically, $K$\nclients have each $n$ training samples generated independently according to a\npossibly different data distribution, and their individually chosen models are\naggregated by a central server. We study the effect of the discrepancy between\nthe clients' data distributions on the generalization error of the aggregated\nmodel. First, we establish in-expectation and tail upper bounds on the\ngeneralization error in terms of the distributions. In part, the bounds extend\nthe popular Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) bound, which was developed for\nthe centralized learning setting, i.e., $K=1$, to the distributed learning\nsetting with an arbitrary number of clients $K \\geq 1$. Then, we connect with\ninformation-theoretic rate-distortion theory to derive possibly tighter\n\\textit{lossy} versions of these bounds. Next, we apply our lossy bounds to\nstudy the effect of data heterogeneity across clients on the generalization\nerror for the distributed classification problem in which each client uses\nSupport Vector Machines (DSVM). In this case, we establish explicit\ngeneralization error bounds that depend explicitly on the data heterogeneity\ndegree. It is shown that the bound gets smaller as the degree of data\nheterogeneity across clients increases, thereby suggesting that DSVM\ngeneralizes better when the dissimilarity between the clients' training samples\nis bigger.

    "abstract": "Humans can naturally learn new and varying tasks in a sequential manner.\nContinual learning is a class of learning algorithms that updates its learned\nmodel as it sees new data (on potentially new tasks) in a sequence. A key\nchallenge in continual learning is that as the model is updated to learn new\ntasks, it becomes susceptible to catastrophic forgetting, where knowledge of\npreviously learned tasks is lost. A popular approach to mitigate forgetting\nduring continual learning is to maintain a small buffer of previously-seen\nsamples and to replay them during training. However, this approach is limited\nby the small buffer size, and while forgetting is reduced, it is still present.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel loss function, STAR, that exploits the\nworst-case parameter perturbation that reduces the KL-divergence of model\npredictions with that of its local parameter neighborhood to promote stability\nand alleviate forgetting. STAR can be combined with almost any existing\nrehearsal-based method as a plug-and-play component. We empirically show that\nSTAR consistently improves the performance of existing methods by up to 15%\nacross varying baselines and achieves superior or competitive accuracy to that\nof state-of-the-art methods aimed at improving rehearsal-based continual\nlearning.",

    "abstract": "Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) enables each attention head to capture\nmulti-frequency information along the sequence dimension and is widely applied\nin foundation models. However, the nonlinearity introduced by RoPE complicates\noptimization of the key state in the Key-Value (KV) cache for RoPE-based\nattention. Existing KV cache compression methods typically store key state\nbefore rotation and apply the transformation during decoding, introducing\nadditional computational overhead. This paper introduces EliteKV, a flexible\nmodification framework for RoPE-based models supporting variable KV cache\ncompression ratios. EliteKV first identifies the intrinsic frequency preference\nof each head using RoPElite, selectively restoring linearity to certain\ndimensions of key within attention computation. Building on this, joint\nlow-rank compression of key and value enables partial cache sharing.\nExperimental results show that with minimal uptraining on only $0.6\\%$ of the\noriginal training data, RoPE-based models achieve a $75\\%$ reduction in KV\ncache size while preserving performance within a negligible margin.\nFurthermore, EliteKV consistently performs well across models of different\nscales within the same family.",

DeepSDF has been used\npredominantly as a category-level shape prior, but it struggles to reconstruct\nsharp geometry and is computationally expensive. In contrast, NeRFs capture\nfine details but have yet to be effectively integrated with category-level\npriors in a real-time multi-object mapping framework. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce PRENOM, a Prior-based Efficient Neural Object Mapper that integrates\ncategory-level priors with object-level NeRFs to enhance reconstruction\nefficiency and enable canonical object pose estimation. PRENOM gets to know\nobjects on a first-name basis by meta-learning on synthetic reconstruction\ntasks generated from open-source shape datasets. To account for object category\nvariations, it employs a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize the NeRF\narchitecture for each category, balancing reconstruction quality and training\ntime. Additionally, prior-based probabilistic ray sampling directs sampling\ntoward expected object regions, accelerating convergence and improving\nreconstruction quality under constrained resources. Experimental results\nhighlight the ability of PRENOM to achieve high-quality reconstructions while\nmaintaining computational feasibility. Specifically, comparisons with\nprior-free NeRF-based approaches on a synthetic dataset show a 21\\% lower\nChamfer distance.

Then, we computed a grid of one\ndimensional explosion models for evolved stars with varying masses and\nestimated the properties of the progenitor star of SN 2024ggi by comparing the\nmodels to the observations. The observed bolometric luminosity and expansion\nvelocities are well-matched by a model involving the explosion of a star in the\npresence of a close circumstellar material (CSM), with a zero-age main sequence\nmass of $\\mathrm{M_{ZAMS}}$ = 15 $M_{\\odot}$, a pre-SN mass and radius of 14.1\n$M_{\\odot}$ and 517 $R_{\\odot}$, respectively, an explosion energy of\n$1.3\\times10^{51}$ erg, and a nickel mass below 0.035 $M_{\\odot}$.

Approach:We propose a novel\ndiffusion-based SR framework called Res-SRDiff, which integrates residual error\nshifting into the forward diffusion process. This enables efficient HR image\nreconstruction by aligning the degraded HR and LR distributions.We evaluated\nRes-SRDiff on ultra-high-field brain T1 MP2RAGE maps and T2-weighted prostate\nimages, comparing it with Bicubic, Pix2pix, CycleGAN, and a conventional\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic model with vision transformer backbone\n(TM-DDPM), using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio\n(PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), gradient magnitude similarity\ndeviation (GMSD), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). Main\nresults: Res-SRDiff significantly outperformed all comparative methods in terms\nof PSNR, SSIM, and GMSD across both datasets, with statistically significant\nimprovements (p-values<<0.05). The model achieved high-fidelity image\nrestoration with only four sampling steps, drastically reducing computational\ntime to under one second per slice, which is substantially faster than\nconventional TM-DDPM with around 20 seconds per slice. Qualitative analyses\nfurther demonstrated that Res-SRDiff effectively preserved fine anatomical\ndetails and lesion morphology in both brain and pelvic MRI images.\nSignificance: Our findings show that Res-SRDiff is an efficient and accurate\nMRI SR method, markedly improving computational efficiency and image quality.\nIntegrating residual error shifting into the diffusion process allows for rapid\nand robust HR image reconstruction, enhancing clinical MRI workflows and\nadvancing medical imaging research.

A significant share of\nthe transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy will be borne by industry\nand the economy, requiring both the decarbonization of the electricity grid and\nthe electrification of industrial processes. But how quickly are firms adopting\nlow-carbon electricity? Using a unique dataset on Hungary\\textquotesingle{}s\nnational supply chain network, we analyze the energy portfolios of 27,067\nfirms, covering more than 80% of gas, 70% of electricity, and 50% of oil\nconsumption between 2020 and 2023. This enables us to objectively measure the\ntrends of decarbonization efforts at the firm level. Although more than half of\nfirms have increased their share of low-carbon electricity, many have reduced\nit. Extrapolating the observed trends, we find a transition of only 20% of\ntotal energy consumption to low-carbon electricity by 2050. The current speed\nof transition in the economy is not sufficient to reach climate neutrality by\n2050. If firms would adopt the same efforts as the decarbonization frontrunners\nin their industry, a low-carbon energy share of up to 86% could be reached,\nputting climate targets within reach. As a key barrier, we identify a\n\\textquotesingle{}lock-in\\textquotesingle{} effect, where firms with a high\nratio of fossil fuel costs per revenue are less likely to transition.\nAccelerating the energy transition will require targeted policies that address\nthese barriers, ensuring that firms can align their decarbonization strategies\nwith best practices.",

The eccentricities of CJs show a broad\ndistribution with a decreasing number density towards the larger end. Previous\nplanet formation models fail to reproduce all these features at the same time.\nWe use a planet population synthesis (PPS) model with truncated initial\nplanetesimal distribution and compare the mass and orbital distribution of the\nsimulated planets with the observation. We show that the occurrence of CJs with\nrespect to the orbital period, the slope of the inner boundary of CJs on the\nsemi-major axis - mass diagram, and the eccentricity distribution of CJs agree\nreasonably well with observation, if CJs form from truncated planetesimal disks\nof 10 au or wider with suppressed migration. While PPS simulations generally\noverestimate the fraction of giants with eccentricity below 0.2, $N$-body\nsimulations produce a more consistent eccentricity distribution with\nobservation. While the fraction of high-eccentricity planets can be increased\nby widening the planetesimal disk or reducing the migration speed, a deficit of\ngiants with eccentricity between 0.2-0.4 exists regardless of the choices of\nparameters.

    "abstract": "Extreme response assessment is important in the design and operation of\nengineering structures, and is a crucial part of structural risk and\nreliability analyses. Structures should be designed in a way that enables them\nto withstand the environmental loads they are expected to experience over their\nlifetime, without designs being unnecessarily conservative and costly. An\naccurate risk estimate is essential but difficult to obtain because the\nlong-term behaviour of a structure is typically too complex to calculate\nanalytically or with brute force Monte Carlo simulation. Therefore,\napproximation methods are required to estimate the extreme response using only\na limited number of short-term conditional response calculations. Combining\nsurrogate models with Design of Experiments is an approximation approach that\nhas gained popularity due to its ability to account for both long-term\nenvironment variability and short-term response variability. In this paper, we\npropose a method for estimating the extreme response of black-box, stochastic\nmodels with heteroscedastic non-Gaussian noise. We present a mathematically\nfounded extreme response estimation process that enables Design of Experiment\napproaches that are prohibitively expensive with surrogate Monte Carlo. The\ntheory leads us to speculate this method can robustly produce more confident\nextreme response estimates, and is suitable for a variety of domains.

While prior works\nhave made significant progress, they have not fully exploited pixel-level\ninformation.

Based on the recent results by\n\\textcite{goerigk2025}, this paper is the first one that reformulates a given\nstrictly robust optimization problem with a decision-dependent uncertainty set\nas an equivalent bilevel optimization problem and then uses solution techniques\nfrom the latter field to solve the robust problem at hand. If the uncertainty\nset can be dualized, the respective bilevel techniques to obtain a single-level\nreformulation are very similar compared with the classic dualization techniques\nused in robust optimization but lead to larger single-level problems to be\nsolved. Our numerical study shows that this leads to larger computation times\nbut may also slightly improve the dual bound. For the more challenging case of\ndecision-dependent uncertainty sets represented by mixed-integer linear models\nwe cannot apply standard dualization techniques. Thus, we compare the presented\nbilevel approach with the only available method from the literature, which is\nbased on quantified mixed-integer linear programs. Our numerical results\nindicate that, for the problem class of decision-dependent robust optimization\nproblems, the bilevel approach performs better in terms of computation times.",

    "abstract": "Credit card fraud imposes significant costs on both cardholders and issuing\nbanks. Fraudsters often disguise their crimes, such as using legitimate\ntransactions through several benign users to bypass anti-fraud detection.\nExisting graph neural network (GNN) models struggle with learning features of\ncamouflaged, indirect multi-hop transactions due to their inherent\nover-smoothing issues in deep multi-layer aggregation, presenting a major\nchallenge in detecting disguised relationships. Therefore, in this paper, we\npropose a novel High-order Graph Representation Learning model (HOGRL) to avoid\nincorporating excessive noise during the multi-layer aggregation process. In\nparticular, HOGRL learns different orders of \\emph{pure} representations\ndirectly from high-order transaction graphs. We realize this goal by\neffectively constructing high-order transaction graphs first and then learning\nthe \\emph{pure} representations of each order so that the model could identify\nfraudsters' multi-hop indirect transactions via multi-layer \\emph{pure} feature\nlearning. In addition, we introduce a mixture-of-expert attention mechanism to\nautomatically determine the importance of different orders for jointly\noptimizing fraud detection performance. We conduct extensive experiments in\nboth the open source and real-world datasets, the result demonstrates the\nsignificant improvements of our proposed HOGRL compared with state-of-the-art\nfraud detection baselines.

The structures outlined by different kinds of\nyoung objects do not exhibit significant deviation from each other. The\ndistributions of young objects are in agreement with three arm-like features\nemerging in the over-density map of evolved stars.

Amplitude encoding has been\nwidely used owing to its remarkable efficiency in encoding a number of $2^{n}$\nclassical data into $n$ qubits simultaneously. However, the theoretical impact\nof amplitude encoding on QML has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work\nwe prove that under some broad and typical data assumptions, the average of\nencoded quantum states via amplitude encoding tends to concentrate towards a\nspecific state. This concentration phenomenon severely constrains the\ncapability of quantum classifiers as it leads to a loss barrier phenomenon,\nnamely, the loss function has a lower bound that cannot be improved by any\noptimization algorithm.

    "abstract": "We study and compare the expressive power of transformers, RNNs, and\ntransformers with chain of thought tokens on a simple and natural class of\nproblems we term Compositional Reasoning Questions (CRQ). This family captures\nproblems like evaluating Boolean formulas and multi-step word problems.\nAssuming standard hardness assumptions from circuit complexity and\ncommunication complexity, we prove that none of these three architectures is\ncapable of solving CRQs unless some hyperparameter (depth, embedding dimension,\nand number of chain of thought tokens, respectively) grows with the size of the\ninput. We also provide a construction for each architecture that solves CRQs.\nFor transformers, our construction uses depth that is logarithmic in the\nproblem size. For RNNs, logarithmic embedding dimension is necessary and\nsufficient, so long as the inputs are provided in a certain order. (Otherwise,\na linear dimension is necessary). For transformers with chain of thought, our\nconstruction uses $n$ CoT tokens. These results show that, while CRQs are\ninherently hard, there are several different ways for language models to\novercome this hardness. Even for a single class of problems, each architecture\nhas strengths and weaknesses, and none is strictly better than the others.",

However, traditional data collection systems for dexterous\nmanipulation face challenges, including a lack of balance between acquisition\nefficiency, consistency, and accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce\nExo-ViHa, an innovative 3D-printed exoskeleton system that enables users to\ncollect data from a first-person perspective while providing real-time haptic\nfeedback. This system combines a 3D-printed modular structure with a slam\ncamera, a motion capture glove, and a wrist-mounted camera. Various dexterous\nhands can be installed at the end, enabling it to simultaneously collect the\nposture of the end effector, hand movements, and visual data. By leveraging the\nfirst-person perspective and direct interaction, the exoskeleton enhances the\ntask realism and haptic feedback, improving the consistency between\ndemonstrations and actual robot deployments. In addition, it has cross-platform\ncompatibility with various robotic arms and dexterous hands. Experiments show\nthat the system can significantly improve the success rate and efficiency of\ndata collection for dexterous manipulation tasks.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) gives rise to ethical\nconcerns about their performance, while opening new avenues for developing\ntoxic language detection techniques. However, LLMs' unethical output and their\ncapability of detecting toxicity have primarily been tested on language data\nthat do not demand complex meaning inference, such as the biased associations\nof 'he' with programmer and 'she' with household. Nowadays toxic language\nadopts a much more creative range of implicit forms, thanks to advanced\ncensorship. In this study, we collect authentic toxic interactions that evade\nonline censorship and that are verified by human annotators as\ninference-intensive. To evaluate and improve LLMs' reasoning of the authentic\nimplicit toxic language, we propose a new prompting method, Pragmatic Inference\nChain (PIC), drawn on interdisciplinary findings from cognitive science and\nlinguistics. The PIC prompting significantly improves the success rate of\nGPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, DeepSeek-v2.5, and DeepSeek-v3 in identifying\nimplicit toxic language, compared to five baseline prompts, such as CoT and\nrule-based baselines.

This effect, which is enabled by spin-orbit coupling, is giant for the\ntop valence Eu $4f$ bands, and can be switched by external electric or magnetic\nfields.

Our model generalizes the\nclassic bilateral trade setting to a multi-buyer environment. Specifically, the\nmechanism designer runs a second-price auction among the buyers -- extending\nthe fixed-price mechanism used in bilateral trade -- before proposing a price\nto the seller. While this setting introduces new challenges compared to\nbilateral trade, it also provides an informational advantage. Indeed, the\npresence of multiple buyers enhances competition, inducing them to reveal their\nvaluations in order to win the auction. However, as in bilateral trade, the\nseller faces a binary decision: whether to accept the proposed price or not. We\nshow that this asymmetric feedback, which is more informative than in bilateral\ntrade, allows us to break some lower bounds on regret minimization with a\nsingle buyer. In particular, we provide a $\\tilde O(T^{2/3})$ regret upper\nbound with respect to an optimal strong budget-balanced mechanism, without any\nassumptions on the distribution of valuations. Our main tool for achieving this\nresult is the design of an adaptive grid that approximates the optimal gain\nfrom trade across the continuum of possible mechanisms. Furthermore, we attain\nthe same regret bound with respect to an optimal global budget-balanced\nmechanism, under two possible conditions: (i) buyers' and seller's valuations\nare independent, or (ii) valuations are drawn from a distribution with bounded\ndensity. In doing so, we provide some novel technical results on constrained\nMABs with feedback graphs, which may be of independent interest.",

We consider crossings as dummy vertices and apply the\nunit edge-length convention to the edge segments connecting any two (real or\ndummy) vertices.

We present several efficient and easily implementable\nalgorithms for recognizing graphs that admit UER-RF drawings and for\nconstructing such drawings if they exist. We consider restrictions on the\ndegree of the vertices or on the size of the faces. For each type of\nrestriction, we consider both the general unconstrained setting and a setting\nin which either the external boundary of the drawing is fixed or the rotation\nsystem of the graph is fixed as part of the input.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in data collection have led to increasingly common repeated\nobservations with complex structures in biomedical studies. Treating these\nobservations as random objects, rather than summarizing features as vectors,\navoids feature extraction and better reflects the data's nature. Examples\ninclude repeatedly measured activity intensity distributions in physical\nactivity analysis and brain networks in neuroimaging. Testing whether these\nrepeated random objects differ across groups is fundamentally important;\nhowever, traditional statistical tests often face challenges due to the\nnon-Euclidean nature of metric spaces, dependencies from repeated measurements,\nand the unequal number of repeated measures. By defining within-subject\nvariability using pairwise distances between repeated measures and extending\nFr\\'echet analysis of variance, we develop a generalized Fr\\'echet test for\nexchangeable repeated random objects, applicable to general metric space-valued\ndata with unequal numbers of repeated measures. The proposed test can\nsimultaneously detect differences in location, scale, and within-subject\nvariability. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic, which\nfollows a weighted chi-squared distribution. Simulations demonstrate that the\nproposed test performs well across different types of random objects. We\nillustrate its effectiveness through applications to physical activity data and\nresting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data.",

Often, the dynamic critical\nexponent $z$ is set to be one as the most natural choice for quantum field\ntheory representations, which further implies emergence of higher space-time\nsymmetries near QCPs in many condensed matter systems. In this article, we\nstudy a family of topological quantum critical points (tQCPs) where the $z=1$\nquantum field theory is prohibited in a fundamental representation by a\nprotecting symmetry, resulting in tQCPs with $z=2$. We further illustrate that\nwhen strong interactions are properly taken into account, the stable weakly\ninteracting gapless tQCPs with $z=2$ can further make a transition to another\nfamily of gapless tQCPs with dynamic critical exponent $z=1$, without breaking\nthe protecting symmetry.

The goal of these assessments is to identify\nwhether the model is a reasonable (and ideally accurate) representation of the\ndomain knowledge and/or observed data. There are many commonly used visual\npredictive checks which can be misleading if their implicit assumptions do not\nmatch the reality. Thus, there is a need for more guidance for selecting,\ninterpreting, and diagnosing appropriate visualizations. As a visual predictive\ncheck itself can be viewed as a model fit to data, assessing when this model\nfails to represent the data is important for drawing well-informed conclusions.\n  We present recommendations and diagnostic tools to mitigate ad-hoc\ndecision-making in visual predictive checks. These contributions aim to improve\nthe robustness and interpretability of Bayesian model criticism practices. We\noffer recommendations for appropriate visual predictive checks for observations\nthat are: continuous, discrete, or a mixture of the two. We also discuss\ndiagnostics to aid in the selection of visual methods. Specifically, in the\ndetection of an incorrect assumption of continuously-distributed data:\nidentifying when data is likely to be discrete or contain discrete components,\ndetecting and estimating possible bounds in data, and a diagnostic of the\ngoodness-of-fit to data for density plots made through kernel density\nestimates.",

Modern Earth System Models (ESMs) face similar challenges,\noperating at high spatial and temporal resolutions, producing petabytes of data\nper simulated day. Data compression has gained relevance over the past decade,\nwith neural compression (NC) emerging from deep learning and information\ntheory, making EO data and ESM outputs ideal candidates due to their abundance\nof unlabeled data.

We discuss the unique characteristics\nof EO and ESM data, contrasting them with \"natural images\", and explain the\nadditional challenges and opportunities they present. Moreover, we review\ncurrent applications of NC across various EO modalities and explore the limited\nefforts in ESM compression to date. The advent of self-supervised learning\n(SSL) and foundation models (FM) has advanced methods to efficiently distill\nrepresentations from vast unlabeled data. We connect these developments to NC\nfor EO, highlighting the similarities between the two fields and elaborate on\nthe potential of transferring compressed feature representations for\nmachine--to--machine communication.

The findings underscore MoEs potential to improve\ndemand forecasting, optimize targeted marketing strategies, and refine\nsegmentation practices.

    "abstract": "Contact binaries are found throughout the solar system. The recent discovery\nof Selam, the satellite of MBA (152830) Dinkinesh, by the NASA LUCY mission has\nmade it clear that the term `contact binary' covers a variety of different\ntypes of bi-modal mass distributions and formation mechanisms. Only by\nmodelling more contact binaries can this population be properly understood. We\ndetermined a spin state and shape model for the Apollo group contact binary\nasteroid (388188) 2006 DP14 using ground-based optical and radar observations\ncollected between 2014 and 2023. Radar delay-Doppler images and continuous wave\nspectra were collected over two days in February 2014, while 16 lightcurves in\nthe Cousins R and SDSS-r filters were collected in 2014, 2022 and 2023. We\nmodelled the spin state using convex inversion before using the SHAPE modelling\nsoftware to include the radar observations in modelling concavities and the\ndistinctive neck structure connecting the two lobes. We find a spin state with\na period of $(5.7860\\pm0.0001)$ hours and pole solution of $\\lambda =\n(180\\pm121)^\\circ$ and $\\beta = (-80\\pm7)^\\circ$ with morphology indicating a\n520 m long bi-lobed shape. The model's asymmetrical bi-modal mass distribution\nresembles other small NEA contact binaries such as (85990) 1999 JV6 or (8567)\n1996 HW1, which also feature a smaller `head' attached to a larger `body'. The\nfinal model features a crater on the larger lobe, similar to several other\nmodelled contact binaries. The model's resolution is 25 m, comparable to that\nof the radar images used.",

The approach starts\nwith preparing ROI (Region of Interest) background images by taking a running\naverage in initial camera frames and later subtracting it from the live camera\nframes to get a binary mask image. We calculate the pointer's position as the\ntop of the contour on the binary image. When drawing a circle on the canvas in\nthat position, it simulates the drawing. Furthermore, we combine the\npre-trained Tesseract model for OCR purposes. To address the false contours, we\nperform hand detection based on the haar cascade before performing the\nbackground subtraction.

Despite their demonstrated efficiency and\nperformance, pretraining such non-standard architectures from scratch remains\ncostly and risky. The linearization of large language models (LLMs) transforms\npretrained standard models into linear recurrent structures, enabling more\nefficient deployment. However, current linearization methods typically\nintroduce additional feature map modules that require extensive fine-tuning and\noverlook the gating mechanisms used in state-of-the-art linear recurrent\nmodels. To address these issues, this paper presents Liger, short for\nLinearizing LLMs to gated recurrent structures. Liger is a novel approach for\nconverting pretrained LLMs into gated linear recurrent models without adding\nextra parameters. It repurposes the pretrained key matrix weights to construct\ndiverse gating mechanisms, facilitating the formation of various gated\nrecurrent structures while avoiding the need to train additional components\nfrom scratch. Using lightweight fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),\nLiger restores the performance of the linearized gated recurrent models to\nmatch that of the original LLMs. Additionally, we introduce Liger Attention, an\nintra-layer hybrid attention mechanism, which significantly recovers 93\\% of\nthe Transformer-based LLM at 0.02\\% pre-training tokens during the\nlinearization process, achieving competitive results across multiple\nbenchmarks, as validated on models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters.

In order to realize this science, we need to correctly\nlocalize the host galaxy of the merging MBHB. Multi-wavelength, time-dependent\nelectromagnetic (EM) signatures can greatly facilitate the identification of\nthe unique EM counterpart among many sources in LISA's localization volume. To\nthis end, we studied merging unequal-mass MBHBs embedded in a CBD using\nhigh-resolution 2D simulations, with a $\\Gamma$-law equation of state,\nincorporating viscous heating, shock heating and radiative cooling. We simulate\neach binary starting from before it decouples from the CBD until just after the\nmerger. We compute EM signatures and identify distinct features before, during,\nand after the merger. We corroborate previous findings of a several order of\nmagnitude drop in the thermal X-ray luminosity near the time of merger, but\nwith delayed timing compared to an equal-mass system. The source remains X-ray\ndark for hours post-merger. Our main results are a potential new signature of a\nsharp spike in the thermal X-ray emission just before the tell-tale steep drop\noccurs. This feature may further help to identify EM counterparts of LISA's\nunequal MBHBs before merger without the need for extensive pre-merger\nmonitoring.

The clumpiness in the cool CGM is considered by\nmodeling individual clouds.

    "abstract": "This article presents an alternative approach to finite elements for modeling\nand analyzing 3D static mooring lines using string theory and the shooting\nmethod (SM) to solve two-point boundary value problems (TPBVPs) for 3D\nnonlinear static string equations with various boundary condition (BC) types\nrelevant to offshore slender system assemblies.The two-point boundary value\nproblem for nonlinear extensible elastic strings was formulated by\nincorporating arbitrary 3D external distributed loads that are not restricted\nto gravity alone. The TPBVP was reformulated based on the formalism of the\nshooting method. A multi-body/multi-shooting approach is proposed to handle\nmulti-material segments and line assemblies. A formulation of the boundary\nconditions that allows the modeling of Dirichlet, Robin, and mixed boundary\nconditions representing the displacement, force, and combined\nforce/displacement constraints is presented.Four validation cases are\npresented, comparing the results to analytical solutions: (1) a single catenary\nsegment with ball-prismatic joint boundary conditions under several imposed\nforces, (2) a review of all possible boundary conditions for strings, including\nspring-based BCs, (3) the Velaria problem with nonlinear radial distributed\nload, and (4) a three-segment hanging configuration with different material\nproperties connected by a buoy.The results demonstrate an accuracy under 10-9\nin terms of absolute errors for both positions and tensions along the entire\nlength of the mooring lines. The proposed method also provides error control\nthrough adaptive step integration. It demonstrates high accuracy in modeling\ncomplex 3D kinematics and configurations for mooring lines, while limiting the\niterative problem size.The proposed method provides an efficient alternative to\ndiscretization-based techniques for analyzing static configurations of string\nkinematics slender systems with various end constraints, such as mooring lines\nand hawsers assemblies in offshore engineering, while maintaining simplicity in\napproach and implementation.",

Classical representation methods\nintegrate item features using concatenation or neural networks to generate\nhomogeneous representation sequences.

Recent studies\nhave attempted to integrate user-side heterogeneous features into item\nrepresentation sequences, but item-side heterogeneous features, which are vital\nfor performance, remain excluded. To address these challenges, we propose a\nHeterogeneous Information Transformer model for Sequential Recommendation\n(HeterRec), which incorporates Heterogeneous Token Flatten Layer (HTFL) and\nHierarchical Causal Transformer Layer (HCT). Our HTFL is a novel item\ntokenization method that converts items into a heterogeneous token set and\norganizes these tokens into heterogeneous sequences, effectively enhancing\nperformance gains when scaling up the model. Moreover, HCT introduces\ntoken-level and item-level causal transformers to extract fine-grained patterns\nfrom the heterogeneous sequences.

The time-dependency of the state\ntransition dynamics aggravates the notorious stability problems of model-free\ndeep actor-critic architectures. We posit that two properties will play a key\nrole in overcoming non-stationarity in transition dynamics: (i) preserving the\nplasticity of the critic network, (ii) directed exploration for rapid\nadaptation to the changing dynamics. We show that performing on-policy\nreinforcement learning with an evidential critic provides both of these\nproperties. The evidential design ensures a fast and sufficiently accurate\napproximation to the uncertainty around the state-value, which maintains the\nplasticity of the critic network by detecting the distributional shifts caused\nby the change in dynamics. The probabilistic critic also makes the actor\ntraining objective a random variable, enabling the use of directed exploration\napproaches as a by-product. We name the resulting algorithm as $\\textit{\nEvidential Proximal Policy Optimization (EPPO)}$ due to the integral role of\nevidential uncertainty quantification in both policy evaluation and policy\nimprovement stages.

Towards\nthis, we establish two theoretical results that may be of independent interest.\nFirst, we give a complete characterization of all isometries in $G_n$ in terms\nof (i) permuting qubits and (ii) swapping the arguments of all CNOT gates.\nSecond, for any fixed $d$, we establish polynomials in $n$ of degree $2d$ that\ncharacterize the size of spheres in $G_n$ at distance $d$, as long as $n\\geq\n2d$.

To address this limitation, we propose the\nspherical-imaging extension S-R2D2. Firstly, as R2D2, S-R2D2 encapsulates its\nminor cycles in existing 2D-Euclidean deep neural network (DNN) architectures,\nbut adapts its iterative scheme to incorporate the wide-field measurement model\nmapping a spherical image to visibility data. We implemented this model as the\ncomposition of an efficient Fourier-based interpolator mapping the spherical\nimage onto the equatorial plane, with the standard RI operator mapping the\nequatorial-plane image to visibility data. Importantly, the interpolation step\nmust inevitably be performed at a lower-than-optimal resolution on the plane,\nto meet the high-resolution requirement on the sphere of wide-field imaging\nwhile preserving scalability. Therefore, secondly, we design S-R2D2's DNN\ntraining loss to jointly learn to correct the interpolation approximations and\nidentify residual image structures on the sphere, ensuring consistency with the\nspherical ground truth using the adjoint plane-to-sphere interpolator.

Using SARS-CoV-2, our model classified variants\n(alpha, beta, gamma, delta, omicron) with 98% accuracy and generated\nvariant-specific primers. These primers appeared with >95% frequency in target\nvariants and <5% in others, showing good performance in in-silico PCR tests.\nFor Alpha, Delta, and Omicron, our primer pairs produced fragments <200 bp,\nsuitable for qPCR detection. The model also generated effective primers for\norganisms with longer gene sequences like E. coli and S. flexneri.\n  Conclusion: Primer C-VAE is an interpretable deep learning approach for\ndeveloping specific primer pairs for target organisms. This flexible,\nsemi-automated and reliable tool works regardless of sequence completeness and\nlength, allowing for qPCR applications and can be applied to organisms with\nlarge and highly similar genomes.",

    "abstract": "Although multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown its success\nacross diverse domains, extending its application to large-scale real-world\nsystems still faces significant challenges. Primarily, the high complexity of\nreal-world environments exacerbates the credit assignment problem,\nsubstantially reducing training efficiency. Moreover, the variability of agent\npopulations in large-scale scenarios necessitates scalable decision-making\nmechanisms. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework:\nSequential rollout with Sequential value estimation (SrSv). This framework aims\nto capture agent interdependence and provide a scalable solution for\ncooperative MARL. Specifically, SrSv leverages the autoregressive property of\nthe Transformer model to handle varying populations through sequential action\nrollout. Furthermore, to capture the interdependence of policy distributions\nand value functions among multiple agents, we introduce an innovative\nsequential value estimation methodology and integrates the value approximation\ninto an attention-based sequential model. We evaluate SrSv on three benchmarks:\nMulti-Agent MuJoCo, StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, and DubinsCars.\nExperimental results demonstrate that SrSv significantly outperforms baseline\nmethods in terms of training efficiency without compromising convergence\nperformance. Moreover, when implemented in a large-scale DubinsCar system with\n1,024 agents, our framework surpasses existing benchmarks, highlighting the\nexcellent scalability of SrSv.",

We provide the first axiomatic definition of decision trees.\nThese axioms establish a firm mathematical foundation for studying decision\ntree problems. We refer to decision trees that satisfy the axioms as proper\ndecision trees. We prove that only proper decision trees can be uniquely\ncharacterized as K-permutations. Since permutations are among the most\nwell-studied combinatorial structures, this characterization provides a\nfundamental basis for analyzing the combinatorial and algorithmic properties of\ndecision trees. As a result of this advancement, we develop the first provably\ncorrect polynomial-time algorithm for solving the optimal decision tree\nproblem. Our algorithm is derived using a formal program derivation framework,\nwhich enables step-by-step equational reasoning to construct side-effect-free\nprograms with guaranteed correctness. The derived algorithm is correct by\nconstruction and is applicable to decision tree problems defined by any\nsplitting rules that adhere to the axioms and any objective functions that can\nbe specified in a given form.

This\ndraws attention to interpretability, namely, the decision-making process,\ncorrelations contributing to the classification, and high-level features (HLFs)\nrepresenting the difference between signal and background. We address the\ninterpretability issue using a modular architecture called the analysis model\n(AM), which combines several motivated HLFs as the input. We focus on the\ngenerator systematics of the top vs. QCD classification by one of the best\nclassifiers, Particle Transformer (ParT). Taking commonly used event generators\nPythia (PY) and Herwig (HW) as examples, we demonstrate that the event weights\nestimated by the AM generator classifier align the HW classification score\ndistribution to PY ones for QCD jets, with small training uncertainty. This\nsuggests the AM is sufficient to describe simulated QCD jet features with\nrelatively few observables, and generator systematics would also be reduced by\nreweighting the simulation by data. On the other hand, large event weights are\nrequired for QCD-like top jets, which leads to imperfect reweighting for both\nAM and ParT generator classifiers. Moreover, the AM HLFs are insufficient for\ndescribing PY and HW differences, causing lower reweighting accuracy compared\nwith ParT. The missing features are the correlation among the collimated\nhigh-energy jet constituents, which are strongly correlated to the energy flow\npolynomials (EFPs) selected for top vs. QCD classification, showing the\ncomplementarity between AM HLFs and the selected EFPs.",

In this work, we focus on the\nsetting where the entities are represented by binary vectors with missing\nentries, which model incomplete categorical data.

Formally, we show fixed-parameter\ntractable algorithms for the parameters vertex cover, fracture number, and\ntreewidth of the row-column graph, which encodes the positions of the known\nentries of the matrix. Additionally, we tie the complexity of the 1-cluster\nvariant of the problem, which is famous under the name Closest String, to the\ncomplexity of solving integer linear programs with few constraints.

    "abstract": "The management of timing constraints in a real-time operating system (RTOS)\nis usually realized through a global tick counter. This counter acts as the\nfoundational time unit for all tasks in the systems. In order to establish a\nconnection between a tick and an amount of elapsed time in the real world,\noften this tick counter is periodically incremented by a hardware timer. At a\nfixed interval, this timer generates an interrupt that increments the counter.\nIn an RTOS, jobs can only become ready upon a timer tick. That means, during a\ntick interrupt, the tick counter will be incremented, jobs will be released,\nand potentially, a scheduling decision will be conducted to select a new job to\nbe run. As this process naturally uses some processing time, it is beneficial\nregarding the system utilization to minimize the time spent in tick interrupts.\nIn modern microcontrollers, multiple hardware timers are often available. To\nutilize multiple timers to reduce the overhead caused by tick interrupts,\nmultiple methods are introduced in this paper. The number of interrupts that\nare triggered by these timers can then be reduced by mapping tasks to timers in\nsuch a manner that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all task periods in a\nsubset is maximized, and the GCD is adopted as the interrupt interval of the\ntimer. To find an optimal mapping of tasks to timers, an MIQCP-model is\npresented that minimizes the overall number of tick interrupts that occur in a\nsystem, while ensuring a correct task release behavior. The presented methods\nare implemented in FreeRTOS and evaluated on an embedded system. The evaluation\nof the methods show, that compared to the baseline implementation in FreeRTOS\nthat uses a single timer with a fixed period, the presented methods can provide\na significant reduction in overhead of up to $\\approx10\\times$ in peak and up\nto $\\approx 6\\times$ in average.",

Among these, states possessing the quantum numbers\n$J^{PC}=1^{-+}$, such as $\\pi_1(1600)$, $\\pi_1(2015)$, and the recently\ndiscovered $\\eta_1(1855)$, have attracted significant attention due to their\npotential hybrid nature, which involves gluonic excitations. However, the\nphysical interpretation of these states remains contentious, primarily due to\ninconsistencies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations\nregarding their decay widths and mass spectra. To address these challenges, we\nemploy a potential model inspired by SU$(3)$ lattice gauge theory to calculate\nthe masses of light-flavor $1^{-+}$ hybrid states and utilize the constituent\ngluon model to analyze their strong decay properties. Our mass calculations\nsuggest that while the $\\pi_1(1600)$ and $\\eta_1(1855)$ masses are in close\nagreement with the predicted hybrid states, the corresponding decay widths for\n$\\pi_1(1600)$ and $\\pi_1(2015)$ do not support their classification as hybrids,\nimplying alternative interpretations, such as tetraquark or molecular\nconfigurations.

To address this\nchallenge, we introduce TRajectory-class-Aware Multi-Agent reinforcement\nlearning (TRAMA). In TRAMA, agents recognize a task type by identifying the\nclass of trajectories they are experiencing through partial observations, and\nthe agents use this trajectory awareness or prediction as additional\ninformation for action policy. To this end, we introduce three primary\nobjectives in TRAMA: (a) constructing a quantized latent space to generate\ntrajectory embeddings that reflect key similarities among them; (b) conducting\ntrajectory clustering using these trajectory embeddings; and (c) building a\ntrajectory-class-aware policy. Specifically for (c), we introduce a\ntrajectory-class predictor that performs agent-wise predictions on the\ntrajectory class; and we design a trajectory-class representation model for\neach trajectory class.

Machine learning (ML) presents an\nopportunity to harness these patterns for accurate disease diagnosis.\n  Objective: This review synthesized findings from studies exploring ML's\ncapability in leveraging speech for the diagnosis of neurological, laryngeal\nand mental disorders.\n  Methods: A systematic examination of 564 articles was conducted with 91\narticles included in the study, which encompassed a wide spectrum of\nconditions, ranging from voice pathologies to mental and neurological\ndisorders. Methods for speech classifications were assessed based on the\nrelevant studies and scored between 0-10 based on the reported diagnostic\naccuracy of their ML models.\n  Results: High diagnostic accuracies were consistently observed for laryngeal\ndisorders, dysarthria, and changes related to speech in Parkinsons disease.\nThese findings indicate the robust potential of speech as a diagnostic tool.\nDisorders like depression, schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment and\nAlzheimers dementia also demonstrated high accuracies, albeit with some\nvariability across studies. Meanwhile, disorders like OCD and autism\nhighlighted the need for more extensive research to ascertain the relationship\nbetween speech patterns and the respective conditions.\n  Conclusion: ML models utilizing speech patterns demonstrate promising\npotential in diagnosing a range of mental, laryngeal, and neurological\ndisorders. However, the efficacy varies across conditions, and further research\nis needed. The integration of these models into clinical practice could\npotentially revolutionize the evaluation and diagnosis of a number of different\nmedical conditions.",

    "abstract": "The magnitudes of the velocity kicks that neutron stars (NSs) obtain at their\nformation have long been a topic of discussion. In previous work, a novel\nmethod was proposed to determine kicks based on the eccentricity of Galactic\ntrajectories. We applied this method to the isolated pulsars with known\nparallax in order to kinematically constrain the NS natal kick distribution. We\nassumed the velocity vectors of the pulsars to be distributed isotropically in\nthe local standard of rest frame, and for each pulsar we sampled 100 velocities\ntaking into account this assumption. These velocity vectors were used to trace\nback the trajectories of the NSs through the Galaxy and estimate their\neccentricity. Then, we simulated kicked objects in order to evaluate the\nrelationship between kick magnitude and Galactic eccentricity, which was used\nto infer the kicks corresponding to the estimated eccentricities. The resulting\nkick distributions indeed show a bimodal structure for young pulsars and our\nfits resemble the ones from literature well. However, for older pulsars the\nbimodality vanishes and instead we find a log-normal kick distribution peaking\nat ~200 km/s and a median of ~400 km/s. We also compare our methods to\nliterature that suggests natal kicks are significantly higher and follow a\nMaxwellian with $\\sigma=265$ km/s. We cannot reproduce these results using\ntheir sample and distance estimates, and instead find kicks that are consistent\nwith our proposed distribution. We conclude that our kinematically constrained\nkick distribution is well-described by a log-normal distribution with\n$\\mu=6.38$ and $\\sigma=1.01$, normalised between 0 and 1000 km/s. This analysis\nreveals no evidence for bimodality in the larger sample, and we suggest that\nthe bimodality found by existing literature may be caused by their relatively\nsmall sample size.",

On the CLIC2020 test set, our method achieves bitrate savings\nof up to 27.93% on LPIPS and 53.55% on DISTS compared to MS-ILLM.

The symmetry of stress is weakly imposed through the introduction of a\nLagrange multiplier. As such, the method involves three unknowns: stress,\ndisplacement and rotation. To ensure the well-posedness of the scheme, a pair\nof carefully defined finite element spaces is used for the stress, displacement\nand rotation such that the inf-sup condition holds. An appealing feature of the\nmethod is that piecewise constant functions are used for the approximations of\nstress, displacement and rotation, which greatly simplifies the implementation.\nIn particular, the stress space is defined delicately such that the stress\nbilinear form is localized around each vertex, which allows for the local\nelimination of the stress, resulting in a cell-centered system. By choosing\ndifferent definitions of the space for rotation, we develop two variants of the\nmethod. In particular, the first method uses a constant function for rotation\nover the interaction region, which allows for further elimination and results\nin a cell-centered system involving displacement only. A rigorous error\nanalysis is performed for the proposed scheme. We show the optimal convergence\nfor $L^2$-error of the stress and rotation. Moreover, we can also prove the\nsuperconvergence for $L^2$-error of displacement. Extensive numerical\nsimulations indicate that our method is efficient and accurate, and can handle\nproblems with discontinuous coefficients.",

    "abstract": "We consider quantum field theoretic many-body Green's function approach to\nsolve the Coulomb many-body problem. The earlier beyond Born-Oppenheimer\nGreen's function theories are absolute in nature and are based on the\nnon-reduced Hamiltonian. Motivated by the issues following this approach we\nhave developed a reduced Green's function theory which is relational in nature.\nThe central differences between these approaches trace back to the\nrelational-absolute debate, which has continued for over two thousand years\nsince the time of Aristotle and still persists today. We highlight that these\naspects of the theories are connected to several areas of modern physics,\nincluding relational quantum mechanics, quantum reference frames,\nsuperselection rules, the separation of different types of motion and\nspontaneous symmetry breaking. The starting point of any such exact theory must\nbe absolute, given that the global conservation laws hold. However, for the\nobservables to be meaningful, they must be defined with respect to the relative\nspace. Approximations, such as the one introduced by Born and Oppenheimer, can\nbreak global symmetries and make certain parts of the absolute description\nwell-defined. We highlight that spontaneous symmetry breaking is not necessary\nto explain the existence of solids, but entities such as phonons can be\nnaturally explained within the relational theory.",

It introduces more flexible block partitioning, enhancing\ncompression efficiency at the cost of increased encoding complexity. To make\nefficient use of VVC in practical applications, optimization is essential.\nVVenC, an optimized open-source VVC encoder, introduces multiple presets to\naddress the trade-off between compression efficiency and encoder complexity.\nAlthough an optimized set of encoding tools has been selected for each preset,\nthe rate-distortion (RD) search space in the encoder presets still poses a\nchallenge for efficient encoder implementations. In this paper, we propose\nEarly Termination using Reference Frames (ETRF), which improves the trade-off\nbetween encoding efficiency and time complexity and positions itself as a new\npreset between medium and fast presets. The CTU partitioning map of the\nreference frames in lower temporal layers is employed to accelerate the\nencoding of frames in higher temporal layers.

    "abstract": "Since its inception, Fuzzy Set has been widely used to handle uncertainty and\nimprecision in decision-making. However, conventional fuzzy sets, often\nreferred to as type-1 fuzzy sets (T1FSs) have limitations in capturing higher\nlevels of uncertainty, particularly when decision-makers (DMs) express\nhesitation or ambiguity in membership degree. To address this, Interval Type-2\nFuzzy Sets (IT2FSs) have been introduced by incorporating uncertainty in\nmembership degree allocation, which enhanced flexibility in modelling\nsubjective judgments. Despite their advantages, existing IT2FS construction\nmethods often lack active involvement from DMs and that limits the\ninterpretability and effectiveness of decision models. This study proposes a\nsocio-technical co-constructive approach for developing IT2FS models of\nlinguistic terms by facilitating the active involvement of DMs in preference\nelicitation and its application in multicriteria decision-making (MCDM)\nproblems. Our methodology is structured in two phases. The first phase involves\nan interactive process between the DM and the decision analyst, in which a\nmodified version of Deck-of-Cards (DoC) method is proposed to construct T1FS\nmembership functions on a ratio scale. We then extend this method to\nincorporate ambiguity in subjective judgment and that resulted in an IT2FS\nmodel that better captures uncertainty in DM's linguistic assessments. The\nsecond phase formalizes the constructed IT2FS model for application in MCDM by\ndefining an appropriate mathematical representation of such information,\naggregation rules, and an admissible ordering principle. The proposed framework\nenhances the reliability and effectiveness of fuzzy decision-making not only by\naccurately representing DM's personalized semantics of linguistic information.",

Only satellite-era observational datasets are used for\ntraining and validation, while retrospective forecasts from 2012 to 2022 are\nused to assess out-of-sample skill at lead times up to 24 months. Rather than\ntrain a single eSPA model per lead, we introduce an ensemble approach in which\nmultiple eSPA models are aggregated via a novel meta-learning strategy. The\nfeatures used include the leading principal components from a delay-embedded\nEOF analysis of global sea surface temperature, vertical temperature gradient\n(a thermocline proxy), and tropical Pacific wind stresses.

Beyond the IRI's lead times,\neSPA maintains skill out to 22 months for the ranked probability skill score\nand 24 months for accuracy and area under the ROC curve, all at a fraction of\nthe computational cost of a fully-coupled dynamical model.

    "abstract": "We propose an experimental scheme to load ultracold Fermi gases from the\nground orbital band of a one-dimensional optical lattice into the first excited\norbital band. Unlike the narrow momentum distribution of a Bose-Einstein\nCondensate, Fermi gases exhibit a broad momentum distribution. To address this,\nwe define the average loading efficiency across all quasi-momentum states and\ntheoretically perform the loading operation simultaneously for each Bloch\nstate. Using a multiparameter global optimization method, we determine the\nloading efficiency at various lattice depths. We can enhance the loading\nefficiency by adjusting the phase of the lattice, which leverages the different\nsymmetries of Bloch wavefunctions in various optical lattice orbitals. We also\nidentified that the primary factor hindering higher loading efficiency in the\nFermi gas is the multiple occupancy of the quasi-momentum states. Our\nsimulations of various occupancies revealed a decreasing trend in mean loading\nefficiency as the number of occupied quasi-momentum states increases. Finally,\nwe compare our method with other loading techniques and assess its experimental\nfeasibility.",

    "abstract": "As 6G networks evolve, inter-provider agreements become crucial for dynamic\nresource sharing and network slicing across multiple domains, requiring\non-demand capacity provisioning while enabling trustworthy interaction among\ndiverse operators. To address these challenges, we propose a blockchain-based\nDecentralized Application (DApp) on Ethereum that introduces four smart\ncontracts, organized into a Preliminary Agreement Phase and an Enforcement\nPhase, and measures their gas usage, thereby establishing an open marketplace\nwhere service providers can list, lease, and enforce resource sharing. We\npresent an empirical evaluation of how gas price, block size, and transaction\ncount affect transaction processing time on the live Sepolia Ethereum testnet\nin a realistic setting, focusing on these distinct smart-contract phases with\nvarying computational complexities. We first examine transaction latency as the\nnumber of users (batch size) increases, observing median latencies from 12.5 s\nto 23.9 s in the Preliminary Agreement Phase and 10.9 s to 24.7 s in the\nEnforcement Phase. Building on these initial measurements, we perform a\ncomprehensive Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.001) to compare latency distributions\nacross quintiles of gas price, block size, and transaction count. The post-hoc\nanalyses reveal that high-volume blocks overshadow fee variations when\ntransaction logic is more complex (effect sizes up to 0.43), whereas gas price\nexerts a stronger influence when the computation is lighter (effect sizes up to\n0.36). Overall, 86% of transactions finalize within 30 seconds, underscoring\nthat while designing decentralized applications, there must be a balance\nbetween contract complexity and fee strategies.

Furthermore, our experiments\ndemonstrate that the NMRS-based algorithm on crRelevance rankings outperforms\nstatistical tests such as chi-square, ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U test, and\nKruskal-Wallis test.

This issue is\nparticularly pronounced during election periods, where the influence of social\nmedia on election outcomes has become a matter of global concern. With the\nunprecedented number of elections in 2024, against this backdrop, the election\necosystem has encountered unprecedented challenges.

    "abstract": "We revisit the complexity of approximate pattern matching in an\nelastic-degenerate string. Such a string is a sequence of $n$ finite sets of\nstrings of total length $N$, and compactly describes a collection of strings\nobtained by first choosing exactly one string in every set, and then\nconcatenating them together. This is motivated by the need of storing a\ncollection of highly similar DNA sequences.\n  The basic algorithmic question on elastic-degenerate strings is pattern\nmatching: given such an elastic-degenerate string and a standard pattern of\nlength $m$, check if the pattern occurs in one of the strings in the described\ncollection. Bernardini et al.~[SICOMP 2022] showed how to leverage fast matrix\nmultiplication to obtain an\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(nm^{\\omega-1})+\\mathcal{O}(N)$-time complexity for this\nproblem, where $w$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. However, the best\nresult so far for finding occurrences with $k$ mismatches, where $k$ is a\nconstant, is the $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(nm^{2}+N)$-time algorithm of Pissis et\nal.~[CPM 2025]. This brings the question whether increasing the dependency on\n$m$ from $m^{\\omega-1}$ to quadratic is necessary when moving from $k=0$ to\nlarger (but still constant) $k$.\n  We design an $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(nm^{1.5}+N)$-time algorithm for pattern\nmatching with $k$ mismatches in an elastic-degenerate string, for any constant\n$k$. To obtain this time bound, we leverage the structural characterization of\noccurrences with $k$ mismatches of Charalampopoulos et al.~[FOCS 2020] together\nwith fast Fourier transform. We need to work with multiple patterns at the same\ntime, instead of a single pattern, which requires refining the original\ncharacterization. This might be of independent interest.",

In\naugmented reality applications where virtual content is composed into a live\nvideo feed, we can model noise, MB and DoF to make the virtual content visually\nconsistent with the video. Existing methods for this typically suffer two main\nlimitations. First, they require a camera calibration step to relate a known\ncalibration target to the specific cameras response. Second, existing work\nrequire methods that can be (differentiably) tuned to the calibration, such as\nslow and specialized neural networks. We propose a method which estimates\nparameters for noise, MB and DoF instantly, which allows using off-the-shelf\nreal-time simulation methods from e.g., a game engine in compositing augmented\ncontent. Our main idea is to unlock both features by showing how to use modern\ncomputer vision methods that can remove noise, MB and DoF from the video\nstream, essentially providing self-calibration. This allows to auto-tune any\nblack-box real-time noise+MB+DoF method to deliver fast and high-fidelity\naugmentation consistency.",

Specifically, we define channel semantics on three levels: status\nsemantics, behavior semantics, and event semantics, corresponding to channel\nmultipaths, channel time-varying trajectories, and channel topology,\nrespectively. Taking realistic vehicular ISAC scenarios as an example, we\nperform semantic clustering, characterizing status semantics via multipath\nstatistical distributions, modeling behavior semantics using Markov chains for\ntime variation, and representing event semantics through a co-occurrence\nmatrix.

A nonlinear\nconstitutive relationship between stress and linearized strain characterizes\nthe material response. This algebraically nonlinear relationship is critical as\nit mitigates the physically inconsistent strain singularities that arise at\ncrack tips. These strain-limiting relationships ensure that strains remain\nbounded near the crack tip, representing a significant advancement in the\nformulation of boundary value problems (BVPs) within the context of first-order\napproximate constitutive models. For a transversely isotropic elastic material\ncontaining a crack, the equilibrium equation, derived from the balance of\nlinear momentum under a specified nonlinear constitutive relation, is shown to\nreduce to a second-order, vector-valued, quasilinear elliptic BVP. A robust\nnumerical method is introduced, integrating Picard-type linearization with a\ncontinuous Galerkin-type finite element procedure for spatial discretization.\nNumerical results, obtained for tensile loading conditions and two distinct\nmaterial fiber orientations, illustrate that the evolution of crack-tip strains\noccurs significantly slower than that of the normalized stresses. However, the\nstrain-energy density is most pronounced near the crack tip, consistent with\nobservations from linearized elasticity theory. It is demonstrated that the\nframework investigated herein can serve as a basis for formulating physically\nmeaningful and mathematically well-defined BVPs, which are essential for\nexploring crack evolution, damage, nucleation, and failure in anisotropic\nstrain-limiting elastic materials.",

    "abstract": "Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) has revolutionized drug discovery by\nenabling the rational design of molecules for specific protein targets. Despite\nsignificant advancements in improving docking scores, advanced 3D-SBDD\ngenerative models still face challenges in producing drug-like candidates that\nmeet medicinal chemistry standards and pharmacokinetic requirements. These\nlimitations arise from their inherent focus on molecular interactions, often\nneglecting critical aspects of drug-likeness. To address these shortcomings, we\nintroduce the Collaborative Intelligence Drug Design (CIDD) framework, which\ncombines the structural precision of 3D-SBDD models with the chemical reasoning\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs). CIDD begins by generating\nsupporting molecules with 3D-SBDD models and then refines these molecules\nthrough LLM-supported modules to enhance drug-likeness and structural\nreasonability. When evaluated on the CrossDocked2020 dataset, CIDD achieved a\nremarkable success ratio of 37.94%, significantly outperforming the previous\nstate-of-the-art benchmark of 15.72%. Although improving molecular interactions\nand drug-likeness is often seen as a trade-off, CIDD uniquely achieves a\nbalanced improvement in both by leveraging the complementary strengths of\ndifferent models, offering a robust and innovative pathway for designing\ntherapeutically promising drug candidates.",

    "abstract": "The efficient resolution of Bayesian inverse problems remains challenging due\nto the high computational cost of traditional sampling methods. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel framework that integrates Conditional Flow Matching (CFM)\nwith a transformer-based architecture to enable fast and flexible sampling from\ncomplex posterior distributions. The proposed methodology involves the direct\nlearning of conditional probability trajectories from the data, leveraging\nCFM's ability to bypass iterative simulation and transformers' capacity to\nprocess arbitrary numbers of observations. The efficacy of the proposed\nframework is demonstrated through its application to three problems: a simple\nnonlinear model, a disease dynamics framework, and a two-dimensional Darcy flow\nPartial Differential Equation. The primary outcomes demonstrate that the\nrelative errors in parameters recovery are as low as 1.5%, and that the\ninference time is reduced by up to 2000 times on CPU in comparison with the\nMonte Carlo Markov Chain. This framework facilitates the expeditious resolution\nof Bayesian problems through the utilisation of sampling from the learned\nconditional distribution.",

The key of this\ntechnique is to apply hybrid amplitude and phase modulation to the incident\nlight, which significantly enhances the control capability over the output\noptical spectrum. This enhanced control turns to be crucial for the efficient\ngeneration of THz waves. By carefully adjusting the relative phase offset\nbetween microwave RF signals applied to the amplitude and phase modulators and\nby applying an appropriate DC bias to the amplitude modulator, we can\nconsiderably reduce the optical power of unwanted sidebands. This allows us to\nconcentrate more energy on desired frequencies, facilitating the generation of\nhigh-purity THz waves through optical heterodyne mixing at the detector. To\nvalidate our concept, we have successfully generated a dual-frequency-like\nlaser with as spectral separation of 0.897 THz.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to process data associated with\ngraphs. They are finding an increasing range of applications; however, as with\nother modern machine learning techniques, their theoretical understanding is\nlimited. GNNs can encounter difficulties in gathering information from nodes\nthat are far apart by iterated aggregation steps. This situation is partly\ncaused by so-called oversmoothing; and overcoming it is one of the practically\nmotivated challenges. We consider the situation where information is aggregated\nby multiple steps of convolution, leading to graph convolutional networks\n(GCNs). We analyze the generalization performance of a basic GCN, trained for\nnode classification on data generated by the contextual stochastic block model.\nWe predict its asymptotic performance by deriving the free energy of the\nproblem, using the replica method, in the high-dimensional limit. Calling depth\nthe number of convolutional steps, we show the importance of going to large\ndepth to approach the Bayes-optimality. We detail how the architecture of the\nGCN has to scale with the depth to avoid oversmoothing. The resulting large\ndepth limit can be close to the Bayes-optimality and leads to a continuous GCN.\nTechnically, we tackle this continuous limit via an approach that resembles\ndynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with constraints at the initial and final\ntimes. An expansion around large regularization allows us to solve the\ncorresponding equations for the performance of the deep GCN. This promising\ntool may contribute to the analysis of further deep neural networks.",

In this work, we propose a novel DeRS (Decompose, Replace, and\nSynthesis) paradigm to overcome this shortcoming, which is motivated by our\nobservations about the unique redundancy mechanisms of upcycled MoE experts.\nSpecifically, DeRS decomposes the experts into one expert-shared base weight\nand multiple expert-specific delta weights, and subsequently represents these\ndelta weights in lightweight forms. Our proposed DeRS paradigm can be applied\nto enhance parameter efficiency in two different scenarios, including: 1) DeRS\nCompression for inference stage, using sparsification or quantization to\ncompress vanilla upcycled MoE models; and 2) DeRS Upcycling for training stage,\nemploying lightweight sparse or low-rank matrixes to efficiently upcycle dense\nmodels into MoE models.

In this article, we first represent the\nBethe ansatz equations of spin strings in terms of the FES equations of\ndifferent species.

We observe that the equation of\nstate in terms of the FES gives rises to full statistical properties of the\nmodel at quantum criticality, which are in good agreement with the results\nobtained from the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations of the model. From\nthe non-mutual FES, we also precisely determine the quantum scaling functions,\nwhich further agree well with the previous TBA results [Phys. Rev. B 96,\n220401(R) (2017)].

In this study,\nbuilt on the key insight that worst-case prompts exhibit a drift in embedding\nspace, we present Latent Adversarial Paraphrasing (LAP), a dual-loop\nadversarial framework: the inner loop trains a learnable perturbation to serve\nas a \"latent continuous paraphrase\" while preserving semantics through\nLagrangian regulation, and the outer loop optimizes the language model\nparameters on these perturbations. We conduct extensive experiments to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of LAP across multiple LLM architectures on the\nRobustAlpaca benchmark with a 0.5%-4% absolution improvement on worst-case\nwin-rate compared with vanilla supervised fine-tuning.",

We determine\nthe Tur\\'an numbers of these graphs and prove that increasing the distance\nbetween cycles can eliminate more ETSs.

For specific cases when removing two\n6-cycles with distance of -1, 0 and 1, respectively, we calculate the sizes,\nspectral radii, and error probabilities of ETSs. These results confirm that the\nperformance of LDPC codes improves as the distance between cycles increases.\nFurthermore, we design the PEG-CYCLE algorithm, which greedily maximizes the\ndistance between cycles in the Tanner graph.

Here, Sapphire has been chosen as the main substrate due to its\nmaximum acoustic reflectivity at the BSTS-sapphire interface compared to\nBSTS-GaAs, BSTS-Si, and BSTS-MgO interfaces. For the films with thickness more\nthan twice the penetration depth, the transient reflectivity data predominantly\nexhibits travelling acoustic strain pulses (TASP) on the top of\nsingle-exponential electronic decay (~ 2 ps). In contrast, films with thickness\nless than penetration depth are dominated by CAPs and a bi exponential\nelectronic background with decay times of ~ 2 ps and ~ 260-380 ps. The observed\nTASP dynamics are well-described by a theoretical acoustic strain model.\nFurther, to elucidate the underlying physical mechanisms governing the behavior\nof photo-excited carriers, CAPs, and strain pulses, we performed carrier\ndensity and temperature-dependent (7-294 K) studies on BSTS films with\nthicknesses of 22 nm and 192 nm. In the 22 nm film, the both fast and slow\ndecay processes increase with carrier density at room temperature but decrease\nwith temperature at a carrier density of 1.7*10^{19} cm^{-3}. A detailed\nanalysis suggests that the faster decay arises from electron-phonon scattering\nand carrier diffusion, while the slower decay likely results from\ndefect-assisted and phonon-assisted recombination. Furthermore, increasing the\nsample temperature leads to anharmonic decay induced softening of ~ 14 % in the\nphonon frequency and an anomalous ~ 48 % decrease in the phonon damping\nparameter due to reduced Dirac surface electron and acoustic phonon scattering.",

    "abstract": "Image captioning tasks usually use two-stage training to complete model\noptimization. The first stage uses cross-entropy as the loss function for\noptimization, and the second stage uses self-critical sequence training (SCST)\nfor reinforcement learning optimization. However, the SCST algorithm has\ncertain defects. SCST relies only on a single greedy decoding result as a\nbaseline. If the model itself is not stable enough, the greedy decoding result\nmay be relatively worst, which will lead to a high variance of advantage\nestimation, further leading to unstable policy updates. In addition, SCST only\ncompares one sampling result with the greedy decoding result, and the\ngeneration diversity is limited, which may fall into a local optimum. In this\npaper, we propose using the latest Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\nreinforcement learning algorithm as an optimization solution for the second\nstage. GRPO generates multiple candidate captions for the input image and then\ncontinuously optimizes the model through intragroup comparison. By constraining\nthe amplitude of policy updates and KL divergence, the stability of the model\nduring training is greatly guaranteed. In addition, compared to SCST, which\nonly samples one answer, GRPO samples and generates multiple answers. Multiple\ncandidate answers in the group cover a wider solution space. Combined with KL\ndivergence constraints, GRPO can improve diversity while ensuring model\nstability.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) use key-value (KV) cache to reduce redundant\ncomputation in autoregressive generation. However, the KV cache size increases\nlinearly during generation, leading to excessive memory usage, especially for\nlong texts. Most KV cache compression methods evict the unimportant KV pairs to\nmaintain a fixed cache size, which leads to the permanent loss of tokens during\ngeneration. However, singular value decomposition shows that \\textit{values} do\nnot exhibit a strong low-rank property as \\textit{keys} do, suggesting that\ninformation is distributed more evenly across \\textit{values}, in contrast to\nits more redundant distribution within \\textit{keys}. Therefore, methods that\nevict both \\textit{keys} and \\textit{values} risk losing crucial information\nand compromise context integrity, ultimately degrading the output quality. To\naddress this problem, we propose WeightedKV, a novel, training-free approach\nthat discards the \\textit{keys} of less important tokens, while merging their\n\\textit{values} into neighboring tokens via a convex combination weighted by\ntheir average attention scores. In this way, the retained \\textit{keys} serve\nas anchors that guide the generation process, while the merged \\textit{values}\nprovide a rich contextual backdrop.

In this paper, we focus on addressing this challenge by leveraging the\nunder-explored memory offload strategy in PP. With empirical study, we discover\nthat in the majority of standard configurations, at least half, and potentially\nall, of the activations can be offloaded with negligible overhead. In the cases\nwhere full overload is not possible, we introduce a novel selective offload\nstrategy that decreases peak activation memory in a better-than-linear manner.\nFurthermore, we integrate memory offload with other techniques to jointly\nconsider overall throughput and memory limitation. Our experiments proves that\nthe per-device activation memory effectively reduces with the total number of\nstages, making PP a stronger alternative than TP, offering up to a 19\\%\nacceleration with even lower memory consumption.

In this context, carbon-aware scheduling\ncan serve as a powerful way to reduce manufacturing's carbon footprint by\nconsidering the time-dependent carbon intensity of the grid and the\navailability of on-site renewable electricity.\n  This study introduces a carbon-aware permutation flow-shop scheduling model\ndesigned to reduce scope 2 emissions.

To tackle these challenges, we\npropose an asynchronous federated learning scheduling framework for\nnon-stationary channels that aims to reduce client staleness while enhancing\ncommunication efficiency and fairness.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have gradually gained prominence in the field of image\nsynthesis, showcasing remarkable generative capabilities. Nevertheless, the\nslow inference and complex networks, resulting from redundancy at both temporal\nand structural levels, hinder their low-latency applications in real-world\nscenarios. Current acceleration methods for diffusion models focus separately\non temporal and structural levels. However, independent optimization at each\nlevel to further push the acceleration limits results in significant\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, integrating optimizations at both\nlevels can compound the acceleration effects. Unfortunately, we find that the\noptimizations at these two levels are not entirely orthogonal. Performing\nseparate optimizations and then simply integrating them results in\nunsatisfactory performance. To tackle this issue, we propose CacheQuant, a\nnovel training-free paradigm that comprehensively accelerates diffusion models\nby jointly optimizing model caching and quantization techniques. Specifically,\nwe employ a dynamic programming approach to determine the optimal cache\nschedule, in which the properties of caching and quantization are carefully\nconsidered to minimize errors. Additionally, we propose decoupled error\ncorrection to further mitigate the coupled and accumulated errors step by step.\nExperimental results show that CacheQuant achieves a 5.18 speedup and 4\ncompression for Stable Diffusion on MS-COCO, with only a 0.02 loss in CLIP\nscore.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new hierarchically tunable six-dimensional movable\nantenna (HT-6DMA) architecture for base station (BS) in future wireless\nnetworks. The HT-6DMA BS consists of multiple antenna arrays that can flexibly\nmove on a spherical surface, with their three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D\nrotations/orientations efficiently characterized in the global spherical\ncoordinate system (SCS) and their individual local SCSs, respectively. As a\nresult, the 6DMA system is hierarchically tunable in the sense that each\narray's global position and local rotation can be separately adjusted in a\nsequential manner with the other being fixed, thus greatly reducing their\ndesign complexity and improving the achievable performance. In particular, we\nconsider an HT-6DMA BS serving multiple single-antenna users in the uplink\ncommunication or sensing potential unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones in a\ngiven airway area. Specifically, for the communication scenario, we aim to\nmaximize the average sum rate of communication users in the long term by\noptimizing the positions and rotations of all 6DMA arrays at the BS. While for\nthe airway sensing scenario, we maximize the minimum received sensing signal\npower along the airway by optimizing the 6DMA arrays' positions and rotations\nalong with the BS's transmit covariance matrix. Despite that the formulated\nproblems are both non-convex, we propose efficient solutions to them by\nexploiting the hierarchical tunability of positions/rotations of 6DMA arrays in\nour proposed model. Numerical results show that the proposed HT-6DMA design\nsignificantly outperforms not only the traditional BS with fixed-position\nantennas (FPAs), but also the existing 6DMA scheme. Furthermore, it is unveiled\nthat the performance gains of HT-6DMA mostly come from the arrays' global\nposition adjustments on the spherical surface, rather than their local rotation\nadjustments.",

To address this issue, the Posit digital system\ncharacterized by adaptive accuracy, broader dynamic range and low hardware\nconsumption has been put forward. Despite its widespread adoption, the existing\nresearch mainly concentrates on scalar computation, which is insufficient to\nmeet the requirements of large-scale parallel data processing.

The contributions of this paper include the efficient\nimplementation of the vector arithmetic unit, the parametric and modular\nhardware design as well as the verification of the practical application of the\npositive digital system. This paper extracts the quantized data of the first\nconvolutional layer for verification.

One example relates the probability density and survival\nprobability of a Brownian particle or an active run-and-tumble particle with\nstochastic resetting to the corresponding quantities without resetting. A\nsecond example is so-called snapping out Brownian motion, which sews together\ndiffusions on either side of an impermeable interface to obtain the\ncorresponding stochastic dynamics across a semi-permeable interface. A third\nexample relates diffusion-mediated surface adsorption-desorption (reversible\nadsorption) to the case of irreversible adsorption. In this paper we apply\nrenewal theory to diffusion-mediated adsorption processes in which an adsorbed\nparticle may be permanently removed (absorbed) prior to desorption. We\nconstruct a pair of renewal equations that relate the probability density and\nfirst passage time (FPT) density for absorption to the corresponding quantities\nfor irreversible adsorption. We first consider the example of diffusion in a\nfinite interval with a partially reactive target at one end. We use the renewal\nequations together with an encounter-based formalism to explore the effects of\nnon-Markovian adsorption/desorption on the moments and long-time behaviour of\nthe FPT density for absorption. We then analyse the corresponding renewal\nequations for a partially reactive semi-infinite trap and show how the\nsolutions can be expressed in terms of a Neumann series expansion.

For instance, we find that\nQwen-2.5-3B far exceeds Llama-3.2-3B under identical RL training for the game\nof Countdown. This discrepancy raises a critical question: what intrinsic\nproperties enable effective self-improvement? We introduce a framework to\ninvestigate this question by analyzing four key cognitive behaviors --\nverification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining -- that both\nexpert human problem solvers and successful language models employ. Our study\nreveals that Qwen naturally exhibits these reasoning behaviors, whereas Llama\ninitially lacks them. In systematic experimentation with controlled behavioral\ndatasets, we find that priming Llama with examples containing these reasoning\nbehaviors enables substantial improvements during RL, matching or exceeding\nQwen's performance. Importantly, the presence of reasoning behaviors, rather\nthan correctness of answers, proves to be the critical factor -- models primed\nwith incorrect solutions containing proper reasoning patterns achieve\ncomparable performance to those trained on correct solutions. Finally,\nleveraging continued pretraining with OpenWebMath data, filtered to amplify\nreasoning behaviors, enables the Llama model to match Qwen's self-improvement\ntrajectory. Our findings establish a fundamental relationship between initial\nreasoning behaviors and the capacity for improvement, explaining why some\nlanguage models effectively utilize additional computation while others\nplateau.",

Using this framework, we provide a fair\ncomparison to demystify performance claims across different medical image\nsegmentation tasks. Additionally, in an effort to enrich the benchmarking, we\nexplored five new architectures based on Mamba and Transformers, collectively\nnamed X2Net, and integrated them into nnUZoo for further evaluation. The\nproposed models combine the features of conventional U2Net, nnUNet, CNN,\nTransformer, and Mamba layers and architectures, called X2Net (UNETR2Net\n(UNETR), SwT2Net (SwinTransformer), SS2D2Net (SwinUMamba), Alt1DM2Net\n(LightUMamba), and MambaND2Net (MambaND)).

To address this trade-off, we propose the\nHI-series algorithms, hybrid models integrating ItemCF with diffusion-based\napproaches (MD, HHP, BHC, BD) through a nonlinear combination controlled by\nparameter $\\epsilon$. This hybridization leverages ItemCF's diversity and MD's\naccuracy, extending to advanced diffusion models (HI-HHP, HI-BHC, HI-BD) for\nenhanced performance.

    "abstract": "In this paper we analyze the effects of stochastic resetting on an\nencounter-based model of an unbiased run-and-tumble particle (RTP) confined to\nthe half-line $[0,\\infty)$ with a partially absorbing wall at $x=0$. The RTP\ntumbles at a constant rate $\\alpha$ between the velocity states $\\pm v$ with\n$v>0$. Absorption occurs when the number of collisions with the wall (discrete\nlocal time) exceeds a randomly generated threshold $\\widehat{\\ell}$ with\nprobability distribution $\\Psi(\\ell)$. The extended RTP model has three state\nvariables, namely, particle position $X(t)\\in [0,\\infty)$, the velocity\ndirection $\\sigma(t)\\in\\{-1, 1\\}$, and the discrete local time $L(t)\\in\n{\\mathbb N}$. We initially assume that only $X(t)$ and $\\sigma(t)$ reset at a\nPoisson rate $r$, whereas $L(t)$ is not changed. This implies that resetting is\nnot governed by a renewal process. We use the stochastic calculus of jump\nprocesses to derive an evolution equation for the joint probability\ndistribution of the triplet $(X(t),\\sigma(t),L(t))$. This is then used to\ncalculate the mean first passage time (MFPT) by performing a discrete Laplace\ntransform of the evolution equation with respect to the local time. We thus\nfind that the MFPT's only dependence on the distribution $\\Psi$ is via the mean\nlocal time threshold. We also identify parameter regimes in which the MFPT is a\nunimodal function of both the resetting and tumbling rates. Finally, we\nconsider conditions under which resetting is given by a renewal process and\nshow how the MFPT in the presence of local time resetting depends on the full\nstatistics of $\\Psi$.",

Different\nfrom existing methods, our framework takes a garment image segmented from a\ndressed mannequin or a person as the input, eliminating the need for learning\ncloth deformation and ensuring faithful preservation of garment details. The\nproposed framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, we introduce a\ngarment-adaptive pose prediction model that generates diverse poses given the\ngarment. Then, in the next stage, we generate apparel showcase images,\nconditioned on the garment and the predicted poses, along with specified text\nprompts and facial images. Notably, a multi-scale appearance customization\nmodule (MS-ACM) is designed to allow both overall and fine-grained text-based\ncontrol over the generated model's appearance.

    "abstract": "Our study consists of investigations of nuclear ground state properties and\nweak transition rates of even even waiting point nuclei. The calculation was\nperformed for N = 50 and N = 82 nuclei. The Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model\nwas used to explore the nuclear ground state properties of selected nuclei. The\nproton neutron quasi particle random phase (pnQRPA) model was used for the\ncomputation of allowed Gamow Teller (GT) and unique first forbidden (U1F)\ntransitions of the selected waiting point nuclei. The RMF approach with\ndifferent density dependent interactions, DD ME2 and DD PC1, was used to\ncompute potential energy curves and surfaces, quadrupole moments, deformation\nparameters, binding energies, proton neutron separation energies, charge, and\nradii. The RMF computed deformation parameters were used in the pn QRPA model,\nas a free parameter, for the computation of GT and U1F weak transitions. We\ninvestigated three different sets of deformation parameter for the calculation\nof electron emission rates. The rates changed considerably with change in\ndeformation parameter. We later investigated contribution of allowed GT and U1F\nrates and competition between positron capture and electron emission rates at\nhigh stellar temperatures. The computed positron capture rates were significant\nespecially at low densities and high temperatures.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the effects of noise on the diagnostics of quantum\nchaos, focusing on three primary tools: the spectral form factor (SFF), Krylov\ncomplexity, and out-of-time correlators (OTOCs). Utilizing a closed quantum\nsystem model with white noise, we demonstrate that increasing noise strength\nleads to an exponential suppression of these diagnostic measures. Specifically,\nour findings reveal that in the strong noise limit, the SFF, two-point\ncorrelation function, and OTOCs become ineffective in distinguishing chaotic\nbehavior. The SFF is particularly impacted, exhibiting a significant decay that\nobscures its ability to identify quantum chaos. This study highlights the\nchallenges posed by environmental noise in accurately diagnosing quantum\nchaotic systems and suggests that traditional methods may require adaptation to\nremain effective in realistic open quantum systems. Our results underscore the\nneed for further research into robust diagnostic techniques that can account\nfor noise-induced effects in quantum chaotic systems.",

Specifically, we investigate spin\nexcitations within the Kondo lattice-like model, as well as a two-orbital\nHubbard Hamiltonian in proximity to the orbital-selective Mott phase.\nComputational analysis of the magnon dispersion, damping, and spectral weight\nwithin these models reveals unexpected phenomena, such as magnon mode softening\nand the anomalous decoherence of magnetic excitations as observed in earlier\nexperimental efforts, but explained here without the use of the phononic\ndegrees of freedom. We show that these effects are intrinsically linked to\nincoherent spectral features near the Fermi level, which arise due to the\nquantum nature of the local (on-site) triplets. This incoherent spectrum leads\nto a Stoner-like continuum on which spin excitations scatter, governing magnon\nlifetime and strongly influencing the dynamical spin structure factor. Our\nstudy explores the transition from coherent to incoherent magnon spectra by\nvarying the electron density. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the magnitude of\nthe localized spin mitigates decoherence by suppressing the incoherent spectral\ncontributions near the Fermi level. We also discuss the effective $J_1$-$J_2$\nspin Hamiltonian, which can accurately describe the large doping region\ncharacterized by the magnon-mode softening. Finally, we show that this behavior\nis also present in multiorbital models with partially filled orbitals, namely,\nin systems without localized spin moments, provided that the model is in a\nstrong coupling regime.",

    "abstract": "A recently developed upscaling technique, the multicontinuum homogenization\nmethod, has gained significant attention for its effectiveness in modeling\ncomplex multiscale systems. This method defines multiple continua based on\ndistinct physical properties and solves a series of constrained cell problems\nto capture localized information for each continuum. However, solving all these\ncell problems on very fine grids at every macroscopic point is computationally\nexpensive, which is a common limitation of most homogenization approaches for\nnon-periodic problems. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical\nmulticontinuum homogenization framework. The core idea is to define\nhierarchical macroscopic points and solve the constrained problems on grids of\nvarying resolutions. We assume that the local solutions can be represented as a\ncombination of a linear interpolation of local solutions from preceding levels\nand an additional correction term. This combination is substituted into the\noriginal constrained problems, and the correction term is resolved using finite\nelement (FE) grids of varying sizes, depending on the level of the macropoint.\nBy normalizing the computational cost of fully resolving the local problem to\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)$, we establish that our approach incurs a cost of\n$\\mathcal{O}(L \\eta^{(1-L)d})$, highlighting substantial computational savings\nacross hierarchical layers $L$, coarsening factor $\\eta$, and spatial dimension\n$d$.

However, due to the\nimbalance in training data, their capabilities in non-English languages are\nlimited. Recent studies revealed the English-pivot multilingual mechanism of\nLLMs, where LLMs implicitly convert non-English queries into English ones at\nthe bottom layers and adopt English for thinking at the middle layers. However,\ndue to the absence of explicit supervision for cross-lingual alignment in the\nintermediate layers of LLMs, the internal representations during these stages\nmay become inaccurate. In this work, we introduce a deep supervision\nfine-tuning method (DFT) that incorporates additional supervision in the\ninternal layers of the model to guide its workflow. Specifically, we introduce\ntwo training objectives on different layers of LLMs: one at the bottom layers\nto constrain the conversion of the target language into English, and another at\nthe middle layers to constrain reasoning in English. To effectively achieve the\nguiding purpose, we designed two types of supervision signals: logits and\nfeature, which represent a stricter constraint and a relatively more relaxed\nguidance. Our method guides the model to not only consider the final generated\nresult when processing non-English inputs but also ensure the accuracy of\ninternal representations. We conducted extensive experiments on typical\nEnglish-centric large models, LLaMA-2 and Gemma-2, and the results on multiple\nmultilingual datasets show that our method significantly outperforms\ntraditional fine-tuning methods.",

    "abstract": "Parameter-level model merging is an emerging paradigm in multi-task learning\nwith significant promise. Previous research has explored its connections with\nprediction-level model ensembling-commonly viewed as the upper bound for\nmerging-to reveal the potential of achieving performance consistency between\nthe two. However, this observation relies on certain preconditions, such as\nbeing limited to two models, using ViT-based models, and all models are\nfine-tuned from the same pre-trained checkpoint. To further understand the\nintrinsic connections between model merging and model ensembling, this paper\nexplores an interesting possibility: If these restrictions are removed, can\nperformance consistency still be achieved between merging and ensembling? To\nanswer this question, we first theoretically establish a performance\ncorrelation between merging and ensembling. We find that even when previous\nrestrictions are not met, there is still a way for model merging to attain a\nnear-identical and superior performance similar to that of ensembling. To\nverify whether our findings are practical, we introduce a validation framework\ntermed Neural Ligand (NeuLig). The learning process of NeuLig is meticulously\ndesigned with a specialized loss function supported by theoretical foundations.\nExperimental results demonstrate the robust resilience of NeuLig in terms of\nboth model scale and the number of collaborating models. For instance, for the\ncase involving 5 CLIP-ViT-B/32 models, parameter-level merging achieves the\nsame performance as prediction-level ensembling (merging: 95.44% vs.\nensembling: 95.46%).",

However, existing\nimage-text paired datasets exhibit a notable flaw in that the text descriptions\ntend to be overly concise, failing to adequately describe the images and\nprovide sufficient semantic knowledge, resulting in limited alignment of text\nand codebook at a fine-grained level.

The selection and optimization of anomaly detectors strongly rely on\nthe availability of an effective performance evaluation method for TAD. Since\nanomalies in time-series data often manifest as a sequence of points,\nconventional metrics that solely consider the detection of individual point are\ninadequate. Existing evaluation methods for TAD typically employ point-based or\nevent-based metrics to capture the temporal context.

    "abstract": "In robotic reinforcement learning, the Sim2Real gap remains a critical\nchallenge. However, the impact of Static friction on Sim2Real has been\nunderexplored. Conventional domain randomization methods typically exclude\nStatic friction from their parameter space. In our robotic reinforcement\nlearning task, such conventional domain randomization approaches resulted in\nsignificantly underperforming real-world models. To address this Sim2Real\nchallenge, we employed Actuator Net as an alternative to conventional domain\nrandomization. While this method enabled successful transfer to flat-ground\nlocomotion, it failed on complex terrains like stairs. To further investigate\nphysical parameters affecting Sim2Real in robotic joints, we developed a\ncontrol-theoretic joint model and performed systematic parameter\nidentification. Our analysis revealed unexpectedly high friction-torque ratios\nin our robotic joints. To mitigate its impact, we implemented Static\nfriction-aware domain randomization for Sim2Real. Recognizing the increased\ntraining difficulty introduced by friction modeling, we proposed a simple and\nnovel solution to reduce learning complexity. To validate this approach, we\nconducted comprehensive Sim2Sim and Sim2Real experiments comparing three\nmethods: conventional domain randomization (without Static friction), Actuator\nNet, and our Static friction-aware domain randomization. All experiments\nutilized the Rapid Motor Adaptation (RMA) algorithm. Results demonstrated that\nour method achieved superior adaptive capabilities and overall performance.",

Therefore, many\nneuroimaging studies are curated with various imaging modalities, e.g., MRI and\nPET, however, it is often challenging to acquire all of them from all subjects\nand missing data become inevitable. In this regards, in this paper, we propose\na framework that generates unobserved imaging measures for specific subjects\nusing their existing measures, thereby reducing the need for additional\nexaminations. Our framework transfers modality-specific style while preserving\nAD-specific content. This is done by domain adversarial training that preserves\nmodality-agnostic but AD-specific information, while a generative adversarial\nnetwork adds an indistinguishable modality-specific style. Our proposed\nframework is evaluated on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative\n(ADNI) study and compared with other imputation methods in terms of generated\ndata quality. Small average Cohen's $d$ $< 0.19$ between our generated measures\nand real ones suggests that the synthetic data are practically usable\nregardless of their modality type.",

Guided by this promise, many recent works have focused\non scaling up robot data collection and developing larger, more expressive\npolicies to achieve this.

Evaluating and quantifying generalization is\nthe Wild West of modern robotics, with each work proposing and measuring\ndifferent types of generalization in their own, often difficult to reproduce,\nsettings. In this work, our goal is (1) to outline the forms of generalization\nwe believe are important in robot manipulation in a comprehensive and\nfine-grained manner, and (2) to provide reproducible guidelines for measuring\nthese notions of generalization. We first propose STAR-Gen, a taxonomy of\ngeneralization for robot manipulation structured around visual, semantic, and\nbehavioral generalization. We discuss how our taxonomy encompasses most prior\nnotions of generalization in robotics. Next, we instantiate STAR-Gen with a\nconcrete real-world benchmark based on the widely-used Bridge V2 dataset. We\nevaluate a variety of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark to demonstrate\nthe utility of our taxonomy in practice. Our taxonomy of generalization can\nyield many interesting insights into existing models: for example, we observe\nthat current vision-language-action models struggle with various types of\nsemantic generalization, despite the promise of pre-training on internet-scale\nlanguage datasets.

    "abstract": "Multi-terrain cost-efficient path planning is a crucial task in robot\nnavigation, requiring the identification of a path from the start to the goal\nthat not only avoids obstacles but also minimizes travel costs. This is\nespecially crucial for real-world applications where robots need to navigate\ndiverse terrains in outdoor environments, where recharging or refueling is\ndifficult. However, there is very limited research on this topic. In this\npaper, we develop a prompt-based approach, LLM-Advisor, which leverages large\nlanguage models (LLMs) as effective advisors for path planning. The LLM-Advisor\nselectively provides suggestions, demonstrating its ability to recognize when\nno modifications are necessary. When suggestions are made, 70.59% of the paths\nsuggested for the A* algorithm, 69.47% for the RRT* algorithm, and 78.70% for\nthe LLM-A* algorithm achieve greater cost efficiency. Since LLM-Advisor may\noccasionally lack common sense in their suggestions, we propose two\nhallucination-mitigation strategies. Furthermore, we experimentally verified\nthat GPT-4o performs poorly in zero-shot path planning, even when terrain\ndescriptions are clearly provided, demonstrating its low spatial awareness. We\nalso experimentally demonstrate that using an LLM as an advisor is more\neffective than directly integrating it into the path-planning loop. Since LLMs\nmay generate hallucinations, using LLMs in the loop of a search-based method\n(such as A*) may lead to a higher number of failed paths, demonstrating that\nour proposed LLM-Advisor is a better choice.",

PEO enables dynamic adaptation to diverse user preferences at\ninference time without retraining.

The most widely used pre-training methods\ncurrently involve either supervised training to fit a general force field or\nself-supervised training by denoising atomic structures equilibrium. Both\nmethods require datasets generated from quantum mechanical calculations, which\nquickly become intractable when scaling to larger datasets. Here we propose a\nnovel pre-training objective which instead uses cheaply-computed structural\nfingerprints as targets while maintaining comparable performance across a range\nof different structural descriptors.

This paper presents a shared\ncontroller that dynamically applies the MSF based on the user's intended motion\nscale. Inspired by human motor skills, the leader arm trajectory is divided\ninto coarse(fast, large-range movements) and fine(precise, small-range\nmovements), with three features extracted to train a fuzzy C-means(FCM)\nclustering model that probabilistically classifies the user's motion scale.\nScaling the robot's motion accordingly reduces unnecessary repetition for\nlarge-scale movements and enables more precise control for fine operations.\nIncorporating recent trajectory data into model updates and offering user\nfeedback for adjusting the MSF range and response speed allows mutual\nadaptation between user and system. In peg transfer experiments, compared to\nusing a fixed single scale, the proposed approach demonstrated improved task\nefficiency(number of clutching and task completion time decreased 38.46% and\n11.96% respectively), while NASA-TLX scores confirmed a meaningful\nreduction(58.01% decreased) in cognitive load.

Motivated by the critical role posterior inference plays as a\nsubroutine in decision-making (e.g., active learning, bandits), we study the\ninferential and architectural inductive biases that are most effective for\nexchangeable sequence modeling. For the inference stage, we highlight a\nfundamental limitation of the prevalent single-step generation approach:\ninability to distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. Instead,\na long line of works in Bayesian statistics advocates for multi-step\nautoregressive generation; we demonstrate this \"correct approach\" enables\nsuperior uncertainty quantification that translates into better performance on\ndownstream decision-making tasks.

We identify a\nsubtle yet important gap between recently proposed Transformer architectures\nfor exchangeable sequences (Muller et al., 2022; Nguyen & Grover, 2022; Ye &\nNamkoong, 2024), and prove that they in fact cannot guarantee exchangeability\ndespite introducing significant computational overhead.

UniDD\ninterprets each DD objective as a specific filter function that affects the\neigenvalues of the feature-feature correlation (FFC) matrix and modulates the\nfrequency components of the feature-label correlation (FLC) matrix. In this\nway, UniDD reveals that the essence of DD fundamentally lies in matching\nfrequency-specific features. Moreover, according to the filter behaviors, we\nclassify existing methods into low-frequency matching and high-frequency\nmatching, encoding global texture and local details, respectively. However,\nexisting methods rely on fixed filter functions throughout distillation, which\ncannot capture the low- and high-frequency information simultaneously.

    "abstract": "Deconfined criticality and gapless topological states have recently attracted\ngrowing attention, as both phenomena go beyond the traditional Landau paradigm.\nHowever, the deep connection between these two critical states, particularly in\nlattice realization, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we reveal\nthat certain deconfined criticality can be regarded as an intrinsically gapless\ntopological state without gapped counterparts in a one dimensional lattice\nmodel. Using a combination of field-theoretic arguments and large-scale\nnumerical simulations, we establish the global phase diagram of the model,\nwhich features deconfined critical lines separating two distinct spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking ordered phases. More importantly, we unambiguously\ndemonstrate that the mixed anomaly inherent to deconfined criticality enforces\ntopologically robust edge modes near the boundary, providing a general\nmechanism by which deconfined criticality manifests as a gapless topological\nstate. Our findings not only offer a new perspective on deconfined criticality\nbut also deepen our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.",

    "abstract": "The Duffing oscillator describes the dynamics of a mass suspended on a spring\nwith position-dependent stiffness. The mass is assumed to experience a linear\ndamping and a time-dependent external forcing. The model has been instrumental\nin theoretical investigations of dynamical properties of systems with\nparity-conserving symmetry, where a double-well substrate connects two\nmetastable states separated by a barrier. Physical systems of interest include\nnonlinear feedback-controlled mass-spring-damper oscillators, active hysteresis\ncircuits (e.g. memristors), protein chains prone to hydrogen bond-mediated\nconformational transitions, centro-symmetric crystals and so on. In this work\nwe consider a Duffing-type oscillator with a double-well potential represented\nby a hyperbolic function of mass position. The hyperbolic double-well potential\nhas two degenerate minima that can be smoothly tuned by varying a deformability\nparameter, leaving unchanged the barrier height. We investigate solutions of\nthe equation of motion in the absence and presence of damping and forcing. In\nthe absence of perturbations numerical solutions lead to a periodic train of\nanharmonic oscillations featuring a crystal of pulse solitons of sech types.\nHowever, when the hyperbolic double-well potential is inverted, analytical\nsolutions can be obtained which turn out to be kink-soliton crystals described\nby Jacobi elliptic functions. When damping and forcing are taken into\nconsideration, the system dynamics can transit from periodic to chaotic phases\nor vice-versa via period-doubling or period-halving bifurcations, by simply\nvarying the deformability parameter. The Poincar\\'e map of the proposed model\ncarries the well-known characteristic signatures of chaos presursors of the\nstandard Duffing model, which happens to be just a particular case of the\nbistable oscillator model with the hyperbolic double-well potential.",

Higher-order methods are known to be effective for\nsolving such problems, as they speed up convergence rates. These methods often\nrequire, or implicitly ensure, a monotonic decrease in the objective function\nacross iterations.

As a scalable solution, we propose a systematic\nsparsification method for dense graphs by introducing copy nodes to limit the\nnumber of neighbors per graph node. In addition to solving interconnect\ncongestion, this approach enables constant frequency scaling where all spins in\na network can be updated in constant time.

In this work, we propose a novel\nmultimodal learning method named HOP for co-speech gesture generation that\ncaptures the heterogeneous entanglement between gesture motion, audio rhythm,\nand text semantics, enabling the generation of coordinated gestures. By\nleveraging spatiotemporal graph modeling, we achieve the alignment of audio and\naction. Moreover, to enhance modality coherence, we build the audio-text\nsemantic representation based on a reprogramming module, which is beneficial\nfor cross-modality adaptation. Our approach enables the trimodal system to\nlearn each other's features and represent them in the form of topological\nentanglement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HOP achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, offering more natural and expressive co-speech\ngesture generation.

However, there have been limited\nefforts to evaluate these audio FMs comprehensively on their ability to have\nnatural and interactive conversations. To engage in meaningful conversation\nwith the end user, we would want the FMs to additionally perform a fluent\nsuccession of turns without too much overlapping speech or long stretches of\nsilence. Inspired by this, we ask whether the recently proposed audio FMs can\nunderstand, predict, and perform turn-taking events? To answer this, we propose\na novel evaluation protocol that can assess spoken dialog system's turn-taking\ncapabilities using a supervised model as a judge that has been trained to\npredict turn-taking events in human-human conversations. Using this protocol,\nwe present the first comprehensive user study that evaluates existing spoken\ndialogue systems on their ability to perform turn-taking events and reveal many\ninteresting insights, such as they sometimes do not understand when to speak\nup, can interrupt too aggressively and rarely backchannel. We further evaluate\nmultiple open-source and proprietary audio FMs accessible through APIs on\ncarefully curated test benchmarks from Switchboard to measure their ability to\nunderstand and predict turn-taking events and identify significant room for\nimprovement.

Additionally, we developed the first public dataset\nfor ephemeral gully detection, labeled by a team of soil- and plant-science\nexperts.

However, synthesizing training images for\ncompositional learning presents three challenges: (1) efficiency in generating\nlarge quantities of images, (2) text alignment between the generated image and\nthe caption in the exact place of the subtle change, and (3) image fidelity in\nensuring sufficient similarity with the original real images in all other\nplaces. We propose SPARCL (Synthetic Perturbations for Advancing Robust\nCompositional Learning), which integrates image feature injection into a fast\ntext-to-image generative model, followed by an image style transfer step, to\nmeet the three challenges. Further, to cope with any residual issues of text\nalignment, we propose an adaptive margin loss to filter out potentially\nincorrect synthetic samples and focus the learning on informative hard samples.\nEvaluation on four compositional understanding benchmarks demonstrates that\nSPARCL significantly improves the compositionality of CLIP, boosting the\naverage accuracy of the CLIP base model by over 8% across all benchmarks and\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods by 2% on three benchmarks.",

In this work, we argue that\nthese exponential tails originate from the convolution of PDF kernels with\nskewed tails, which can appear at both ends of the PDF. We introduce two\ndensity-fraction strategies -- the mass-fraction and volume-fraction approaches\n-- to explain the physical origins of the low-$s$ and high-$s$ skewed PDF\nkernels. The PDF kernels constructed in this work satisfy the relation that its\nstructural entropy equals the PDF variance, as we proposed in Paper I. These\ntwo types of PDF kernels define two spaces of skewed PDFs, which are dual to\neach other and possess highly symmetric mathematical structures. We thus\nspeculate that the high-$s$ skewed PDF kernels are physical and may be related\nto the power-law tails of the column-density PDFs (on the $\\rho$ scale) of\nmolecular clouds, which are shaped by both turbulence and gravity. Inspired by\nthis, we further construct a form of an `isothermal' turbulent system that\nlikely favors the volume-fraction strategy.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed approaches to\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) tasks across diverse domains. In healthcare,\naccurate and cost-efficient text classification is crucial, whether for\nclinical notes analysis, diagnosis coding, or any other task, and LLMs present\npromising potential. Text classification has always faced multiple challenges,\nincluding manual annotation for training, handling imbalanced data, and\ndeveloping scalable approaches. With healthcare, additional challenges are\nadded, particularly the critical need to preserve patients' data privacy and\nthe complexity of the medical terminology. Numerous studies have been conducted\nto leverage LLMs for automated healthcare text classification and contrast the\nresults with existing machine learning-based methods where embedding,\nannotation, and training are traditionally required. Existing systematic\nreviews about LLMs either do not specialize in text classification or do not\nfocus on the healthcare domain. This research synthesizes and critically\nevaluates the current evidence found in the literature regarding the use of\nLLMs for text classification in a healthcare setting. Major databases (e.g.,\nGoogle Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct) and other resources were\nqueried, which focused on the papers published between 2018 and 2024 within the\nframework of PRISMA guidelines, which resulted in 65 eligible research\narticles. These were categorized by text classification type (e.g., binary\nclassification, multi-label classification), application (e.g., clinical\ndecision support, public health and opinion analysis), methodology, type of\nhealthcare text, and metrics used for evaluation and validation. This review\nreveals the existing gaps in the literature and suggests future research lines\nthat can be investigated and explored.",

Existing automated methods often struggle with\ngeneralizability across diverse game engines due to their reliance on the\nintermediate constraints of specific image domain and typically support only\none type of input, either text or image. To overcome these challenges, we\nintroduce EasyCraft, an innovative end-to-end feedforward framework that\nautomates character crafting by uniquely supporting both text and image inputs.\nOur approach employs a translator capable of converting facial images of any\nstyle into crafting parameters. We first establish a unified feature\ndistribution in the translator's image encoder through self-supervised learning\non a large-scale dataset, enabling photos of any style to be embedded into a\nunified feature representation. Subsequently, we map this unified feature\ndistribution to crafting parameters specific to a game engine, a process that\ncan be easily adapted to most game engines and thus enhances EasyCraft's\ngeneralizability. By integrating text-to-image techniques with our translator,\nEasyCraft also facilitates precise, text-based character crafting.

The bright flares from tidal disruption events (TDEs)\nprovide a new and direct way to probe IMBHs. 3XMM J215022.4-055108 is a unique\noff-nuclear X-ray transient which can be best explained as the TDE by an IMBH\nin a massive star cluster, though its mass is not well determined.

Inspired by this\nprinciple, this paper formally defines a newly emerging problem -- the\npopulation-based evolution of large language models (LLMs) -- and introduces a\nnovel framework. Starting with a population of parent LLMs, our framework\nenables the population to evolve through four key operations: (i) crossover,\nmerging the weights of different parents to create offspring LLMs, (ii)\nmutation, introducing small, random changes to model weights to foster\ndiversity, (iii) selection, prioritizing high-performing models, and (iv)\nsuccession, transferring the learned experience from parent to offspring LLMs.\nWith only 200 samples per new task, the LLM population evolves rapidly to adapt\nto the task at hand, without any gradients. Experiments on 12 datasets show\nthat our framework consistently outperforms existing multi-LLM merging and\nadaptation methods, achieving accuracy gains of up to 54.8% over the best LLM\nin the initial population. Moreover, our framework allows for the evolution of\nLLMs across multiple new tasks simultaneously, scaling effectively with\npopulations of up to 40 LLMs, and even zero-shot generalization to unseen\nheld-out tasks. We have open-sourced the code on GitHub and released the\nweights of 10 parent LLMs, fine-tuned from gemma-2-2b-it, on HuggingFace$,\nenabling reproduction of our proposed framework using just a single 4090 GPU\nwith 24GB memory, without any performance degradation.",

Accurate prediction of pavement distress deterioration is essential\nfor effective road management, cost reduction in maintenance, and improvement\nof traffic safety. However, real-world data on pavement distress is usually\ncollected irregularly, resulting in uneven, asynchronous, and sparse\nspatial-temporal datasets. This hinders the application of existing\nspatial-temporal models, such as DCRNN, since they are only applicable to\nregularly and synchronously collected data. To overcome these challenges, we\npropose the Spatial-Temporal Graph Autoregression Network (STGAN), a novel\ngraph neural network model designed for accurately predicting irregular\npavement distress deterioration using complex spatial-temporal data.\nSpecifically, STGAN integrates the temporal domain into the spatial domain,\ncreating a larger graph where nodes are represented by spatial-temporal tuples\nand edges are formed based on a similarity-based connection mechanism.\nFurthermore, based on the constructed spatiotemporal graph, we formulate\npavement distress deterioration prediction as a graph autoregression task,\ni.e., the graph size increases incrementally and the prediction is performed\nsequentially. This is accomplished by a novel spatial-temporal attention\nmechanism deployed by STGAN. Utilizing the ConTrack dataset, which contains\npavement distress records collected from different locations in Shanghai, we\ndemonstrate the superior performance of STGAN in capturing spatial-temporal\ncorrelations and addressing the aforementioned challenges.

Our analysis indicates that limited training\nscenarios represent the primary factor behind these undesired behaviors.\nExperimental results confirm that scenario augmentation substantially enhances\nthe generalization capabilities of deep reinforcement learning-based navigation\nsystems.

The prevailing solution\nis to sample from distributions expressed as a composition of attributes'\nconditional marginal distributions under the assumption that they are\nstatistically independent. This paper shows that standard conditional diffusion\nmodels violate this assumption, even when all attribute compositions are\nobserved during training. And, this violation is significantly more severe when\nonly a subset of the compositions is observed. We propose CoInD to address this\nproblem. It explicitly enforces statistical independence between the\nconditional marginal distributions by minimizing Fisher's divergence between\nthe joint and marginal distributions. The theoretical advantages of CoInD are\nreflected in both qualitative and quantitative experiments, demonstrating a\nsignificantly more faithful and controlled generation of samples for arbitrary\nlogical compositions of attributes. The benefit is more pronounced for\nscenarios that current solutions relying on the assumption of conditionally\nindependent marginals struggle with, namely, logical compositions involving the\nNOT operation and when only a subset of compositions are observed during\ntraining.",

Existing training-based one-shot part\nsegmentation methods that utilize VFMs encounter difficulties when faced with\nscenarios where the one-shot image and test image exhibit significant variance\nin appearance and perspective, or when the object in the test image is\npartially visible. We argue that training on the one-shot example often leads\nto overfitting, thereby compromising the model's generalization capability. Our\nframework offers a novel approach to part segmentation that is training-free,\nflexible, and data-efficient, requiring only a single in-context example for\nprecise segmentation with superior generalization ability. By thoroughly\nexploring the complementary strengths of VFMs, specifically DINOv2 and Stable\nDiffusion, we introduce an adaptive channel selection approach by minimizing\nthe intra-class distance for better exploiting these two features, thereby\nenhancing the discriminatory power of the extracted features for the\nfine-grained parts. We have achieved remarkable segmentation performance across\ndiverse object categories.

However, these\nreasoning chains can be verbose, raising concerns about efficiency. In\nresponse, recent works have sought to decrease response lengths through simple\nprompting strategies (e.g. 'be concise'). In this work, we conduct the first\nsystematic study of the relationship between reasoning length and model\nperformance across a diverse range of compression instructions (e.g. 'use 10\nwords or less' or 'remove all punctuation'). In doing so, we discover a\nuniversal tradeoff between reasoning length and accuracy that persists across\neven very distinct reasoning chains. We demonstrate that this tradeoff emerges\nfrom a sharp threshold behavior at the question level: each task has an\nintrinsic 'token complexity' - a minimal number of tokens required for\nsuccessful problem-solving. We show how token complexity enables us to compute\ninformation-theoretic limits on the accuracy-compression tradeoff, and find\nthat prompt-based compression strategies operate far from these theoretical\nlimits. This suggests there may be significant room for improvement and our\nframework provides a benchmark to help researchers evaluate progress in\nreasoning efficiency.

We develop a\ntheoretical framework to incorporate decision-making into field theories using\nthe shepherding control problem as a paradigmatic example of a multi-agent\ncontrol system, where agents (herders) must coordinate to confine another group\nof agents (targets) within a prescribed region. By introducing continuous\napproximations of two key decision-making elements - target selection and\ntrajectory planning - we derive field equations that capture the essential\nfeatures of this distributed control problem. Our theory reveals that different\ndecision-making strategies emerge at the continuum level, from average\nattraction to highly selective choices, and from undirected to goal-oriented\nmotion, driving transitions between homogeneous and confined configurations.\nThe resulting nonreciprocal field theory not only describes the shepherding\nproblem but provides a general framework for incorporating decision-making into\ncontinuum theories of collective behavior, with implications for applications\nranging from robotic swarms to crowd management systems.",

These so-called mode mixings lead to gaps in\nthe frequency range that practically lose sensitivity to axions. In order to\nsolve this problem, we present a cavity design which, for two tuning rod\nconfigurations corresponding to a lower and higher frequency range, have a\ndielectric rod inserted at a specific location that makes the cavity\nasymmetrical. Moving the tuning rod closer to the dielectric insert changes the\nlocation and frequency of the mode mixing compared to when it is farther away\nfrom it. This design is easily realizable in practical experiments and makes\npossible an axion dark matter search with minimal loss in sensitivity due to\nmode mixings.

Analysis of GRS\n1915+105 images over the years suggest that the observed changes took place\nwithin a year or less.

However, little analysis has been done on the electric field\nand electric potential using calculations for specific knots.\n  We focus on torus knots, specifically a parametrization that embeds it on a\ntorus centered at the origin with rotational symmetry about the z-axis.\nParticularly, in this project, we analyze the electric field along the z-axis\nto take advantage of symmetry. We also analyze the length of the knot as a\nsimpler integral. We show that the electric field is zero only at the origin,\nand investigate the extreme points of the electric field and electric potential\nusing numerical methods and calculations. We also demonstrate a new way to\napply methods for contour integration in complex analysis to calculate the\nlength, electric potential, and electric field, and provide an explicit\napproximation for the length of a torus knot.",

    "abstract": "While likelihood-based generative models, particularly diffusion and\nautoregressive models, have achieved remarkable fidelity in visual generation,\nthe maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) objective, which minimizes the forward\nKL divergence, inherently suffers from a mode-covering tendency that limits the\ngeneration quality under limited model capacity. In this work, we propose\nDirect Discriminative Optimization (DDO) as a unified framework that integrates\nlikelihood-based generative training and GAN-type discrimination to bypass this\nfundamental constraint by exploiting reverse KL and self-generated negative\nsignals. Our key insight is to parameterize a discriminator implicitly using\nthe likelihood ratio between a learnable target model and a fixed reference\nmodel, drawing parallels with the philosophy of Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO). Unlike GANs, this parameterization eliminates the need for joint\ntraining of generator and discriminator networks, allowing for direct,\nefficient, and effective finetuning of a well-trained model to its full\npotential beyond the limits of MLE. DDO can be performed iteratively in a\nself-play manner for progressive model refinement, with each round requiring\nless than 1% of pretraining epochs. Our experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of DDO by significantly advancing the previous SOTA diffusion\nmodel EDM, reducing FID scores from 1.79/1.58/1.96 to new records of\n1.30/0.97/1.26 on CIFAR-10/ImageNet-64/ImageNet 512x512 datasets without any\nguidance mechanisms, and by consistently improving both guidance-free and\nCFG-enhanced FIDs of visual autoregressive models on ImageNet 256x256.",

Therefore, it is essential to\nevaluate and compare datasets regarding their cluster-label matching (CLM),\ni.e., how well their class labels match actual clusters. Internal validation\nmeasures (IVMs), like Silhouette, can compare CLM over different labeling of\nthe same dataset, but are not designed to do so across different datasets. We\nthus introduce Adjusted IVMs as fast and reliable methods to evaluate and\ncompare CLM across datasets. We establish four axioms that require validation\nmeasures to be independent of data properties not related to cluster structure\n(e.g., dimensionality, dataset size). Then, we develop standardized protocols\nto convert any IVM to satisfy these axioms, and use these protocols to adjust\nsix widely used IVMs. Quantitative experiments (1) verify the necessity and\neffectiveness of our protocols and (2) show that adjusted IVMs outperform the\ncompetitors, including standard IVMs, in accurately evaluating CLM both within\nand across datasets.

    "abstract": "Detecting road boundaries, the static physical edges of the available driving\narea, is important for safe navigation and effective path planning in\nautonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).\nTraditionally, road boundary detection in autonomous driving relies on cameras\nand LiDAR. However, they are vulnerable to poor lighting conditions, such as\nnighttime and direct sunlight glare, or prohibitively expensive for low-end\nvehicles. To this end, this paper introduces 4DRadarRBD, the first road\nboundary detection method based on 4D mmWave radar which is cost-effective and\nrobust in complex driving scenarios. The main idea is that road boundaries\n(e.g., fences, bushes, roadblocks), reflect millimeter waves, thus generating\npoint cloud data for the radar. To overcome the challenge that the 4D mmWave\nradar point clouds contain many noisy points, we initially reduce noisy points\nvia physical constraints for road boundaries and then segment the road boundary\npoints from the noisy points by incorporating a distance-based loss which\npenalizes for falsely detecting the points far away from the actual road\nboundaries. In addition, we capture the temporal dynamics of point cloud\nsequences by utilizing each point's deviation from the vehicle\nmotion-compensated road boundary detection result obtained from the previous\nframe, along with the spatial distribution of the point cloud for point-wise\nroad boundary segmentation. We evaluated 4DRadarRBD through real-world driving\ntests and achieved a road boundary point segmentation accuracy of 93$\\%$, with\na median distance error of up to 0.023 m and an error reduction of 92.6$\\%$\ncompared to the baseline model.",

By\nprecisely identifying and modifying specific neurons within feed-forward\nnetworks, FiNE significantly improves knowledge localization and editing.\nQuantitative experiments demonstrate that FiNE efficiently achieves better\noverall performance compared to existing techniques, providing new insights\ninto the localization and modification of knowledge within LLMs.",

Therefore,\nthis study provides a comprehensive review of the fundamentals, recent\nadvancements, and the challenges of integrating PPML into IoV applications. We\nfirst review existing surveys of various PPML techniques and their integration\ninto IoV across different scopes. We then categorize IoV applications into\nthree key domains and analyze the privacy challenges in leveraging ML in these\napplication domains. Building on these fundamentals, we review recent\nadvancements in integrating various PPML techniques within IoV applications,\ndiscussing their frameworks, key features, and performance in terms of privacy,\nutility, and efficiency.

Based on this, we propose DynamicDPS, a diffusion-based\nframework that integrates conditional and unconditional diffusion models to\nenhance low-quality medical images while systematically reducing\nhallucinations. Our approach first generates an initial reconstruction using a\nconditional model, then refines it with an adaptive diffusion-based inverse\nproblem solver.

    "abstract": "This study is an optimization of GaAs and Al$_{0.55}$Ga$_{0.45}$As growth on\nGaAs (111)B substrates with a surface misorientation of 2{\\deg} towards\n[$\\bar{2}$11], aiming to enhance surface morphology. For quantum optical\nmetasurfaces (QOMs) the change from (001) growth to (111) growth will increase\nthe efficiency of the nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric\ndownconversion (SPDC). This work identifies key factors affecting surface\nroughness, including the detrimental effects of traditional thermal oxide\ndesorption, which prevented growth of smooth surfaces. A novel Ga-assisted\noxide desorption method using Ga flux \"pulses\" was developed, successfully\nremoving oxides while preserving surface quality. In-situ characterization\ntechniques, including reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and a\nnovel technique called Diffuse Laser Scattering (DLS), were employed to monitor\nand control the oxide removal process. Mounting quarter wafers with sapphire\nsubstrates as optical diffusers improved surface uniformity by mitigating\ntemperature gradients. The uniformity of the growths was clearly visualized by\nan in-house technique called black box scattering (BBS) imaging. Indium (In)\nwas tested as a surfactant to promote step-flow growth in GaAs, which resulted\nin atomic-scale flatness with root mean square (RMS) roughness as low as 0.256\nnm. In combination with a higher growth temperature, the RMS roughness of\nAl$_{0.55}$Ga$_{0.45}$As layers was reduced to 0.302 nm. The optimized growth\nmethods achieved acceptable roughness levels for QOM fabrication, with ongoing\nefforts to apply these techniques to various devices based on GaAs/AlGaAs\nheterostructures with (111) orientation.",

    "abstract": "Variational inference (VI) is a popular method to estimate statistical and\neconometric models. The key to VI is the selection of a tractable density to\napproximate the Bayesian posterior. For large and complex models a common\nchoice is to assume independence between multivariate blocks in a partition of\nthe parameter space. While this simplifies the problem it can reduce accuracy.\nThis paper proposes using vector copulas to capture dependence between the\nblocks parsimoniously. Tailored multivariate marginals are constructed using\nlearnable cyclically monotone transformations. We call the resulting joint\ndistribution a ``dependent block posterior'' approximation. Vector copula\nmodels are suggested that make tractable and flexible variational\napproximations. They allow for differing marginals, numbers of blocks, block\nsizes and forms of between block dependence. They also allow for solution of\nthe variational optimization using fast and efficient stochastic gradient\nmethods. The efficacy and versatility of the approach is demonstrated using\nfour different statistical models and 16 datasets which have posteriors that\nare challenging to approximate. In all cases, our method produces more accurate\nposterior approximations than benchmark VI methods that either assume block\nindependence or factor-based dependence, at limited additional computational\ncost.",

    "abstract": "Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN) provides a unique view of\nComptonization and non-thermal emission from accreting black holes in the\nlow-accretion rate regime. However, to decipher the exact nature of the\nComptonizing corona in LLAGN, its geometry and emission mechanism must be\nunderstood beyond the limits of spectro-timing techniques. Spectro-polarimetry\noffers the potential to break the degeneracies between different coronal\nemission models. Compton-thin LLAGN provide an opportunity for such\nspectro-polarimetric exploration in the 2-8 keV energy range using IXPE. In\nthis work, we carry out a spectro-polarimetric analysis of the first IXPE\nobservation, in synergy with a contemporaneous NuSTAR observation, of an LLAGN:\nNGC 2110. Using 554.4 ks of IXPE data from October 2024, we constrain the 99%\nupper limit on the Polarization Degree (PD) to be less than 8.3% assuming the\ncorresponding Polarization Angle (PA) to be aligned with the radio jet, and\nless than 3.6% if in the perpendicular direction. In the absence of a\nsignificant PD detection, the PA remains formally unconstrained, yet the\npolarization significance contours appear to be aligned with the radio jet,\ntentatively supporting models in which the corona is radially extended in the\nplane of the disk. We also carry out detailed Monte Carlo simulations using\nMONK and STOKES codes to test different coronal models against our results and\ncompare the polarization properties between NGC 2110 and brighter Seyferts.",

We leverage object-to-object semantic relationships to plan a path\nthrough the environment that will allow us to accurately and efficiently locate\nour target object while also reducing the overall distance traveled, without\nneeding high-level room or area-level semantic relationships.

Specifically, one first trains a reward\nmodel (RM) on some dataset (e.g. human preferences) before using it to provide\nonline feedback as part of a downstream reinforcement learning (RL) procedure,\nrather than directly optimizing the policy parameters on the dataset via\noffline maximum likelihood estimation. In fact, from an information-theoretic\nperspective, we can only lose information via passing through a reward model\nand cannot create any new information via on-policy sampling. To explain this\ndiscrepancy, we scrutinize several hypotheses on the value of RL in FT through\nboth theoretical and empirical lenses. Of the hypotheses considered, we find\nthe most support for the explanation that on problems with a\ngeneration-verification gap, the combination of the ease of learning the\nrelatively simple RM (verifier) from the preference data, coupled with the\nability of the downstream RL procedure to then filter its search space to the\nsubset of policies (generators) that are optimal for relatively simple\nverifiers is what leads to the superior performance of online FT.",

In particular, online\ncontinual learning - iteratively training the model with small batches of user\nfeedback - has demonstrated notable performance improvements. However, the\nexisting practice of separating training and serving processes forces the\nonline trainer to recompute the intermediate results already done during\nserving. Such redundant computations can account for 30%-42% of total training\ntime.\n  In this paper, we propose Alchemist, to the best of our knowledge, the first\nonline continual learning system that efficiently reuses serving activations to\nincrease training throughput. Alchemist introduces two key techniques: (1)\nrecording and storing activations and KV cache only during the prefill phase to\nminimize latency and memory overhead; and (2) smart activation offloading and\nhedging. Evaluations with inputs of varied token length sampled from ShareGPT\ndataset show that compared with a separate training cluster, Alchemist\nsignificantly increases training throughput by up to 1.72x, reduces up to 47%\nmemory usage during training, and supports up to 2x more training tokens - all\nwhile maintaining negligible impact on serving latency.",
