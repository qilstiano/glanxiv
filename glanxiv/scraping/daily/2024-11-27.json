    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated compelling performance in\nrobotic tasks, but its success often hinges on the design of complex, ad hoc\nreward functions. Researchers have explored how Large Language Models (LLMs)\ncould enable non-expert users to specify reward functions more easily. However,\nLLMs struggle to balance the importance of different features, generalize\npoorly to out-of-distribution robotic tasks, and cannot represent the problem\nproperly with only text-based descriptions. To address these challenges, we\npropose ELEMENTAL (intEractive LEarning froM dEmoNstraTion And Language), a\nnovel framework that combines natural language guidance with visual user\ndemonstrations to align robot behavior with user intentions better. By\nincorporating visual inputs, ELEMENTAL overcomes the limitations of text-only\ntask specifications, while leveraging inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to\nbalance feature weights and match the demonstrated behaviors optimally.\nELEMENTAL also introduces an iterative feedback-loop through self-reflection to\nimprove feature, reward, and policy learning. Our experiment results\ndemonstrate that ELEMENTAL outperforms prior work by 42.3% on task success, and\nachieves 41.3% better generalization in out-of-distribution tasks, highlighting\nits robustness in LfD.",

    "abstract": "Faithful image super-resolution (SR) not only needs to recover images that\nappear realistic, similar to image generation tasks, but also requires that the\nrestored images maintain fidelity and structural consistency with the input. To\nthis end, we propose a simple and effective method, named FaithDiff, to fully\nharness the impressive power of latent diffusion models (LDMs) for faithful\nimage SR. In contrast to existing diffusion-based SR methods that freeze the\ndiffusion model pre-trained on high-quality images, we propose to unleash the\ndiffusion prior to identify useful information and recover faithful structures.\nAs there exists a significant gap between the features of degraded inputs and\nthe noisy latent from the diffusion model, we then develop an effective\nalignment module to explore useful features from degraded inputs to align well\nwith the diffusion process. Considering the indispensable roles and interplay\nof the encoder and diffusion model in LDMs, we jointly fine-tune them in a\nunified optimization framework, facilitating the encoder to extract useful\nfeatures that coincide with diffusion process. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that FaithDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing\nhigh-quality and faithful SR results.",

To\neffectively tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach to optimize a\nset of compact learnable hierarchical task tokens, including global and\nfine-grained ones, to discover consistent pixel-wise supervision signals in\nboth feature and prediction levels. Specifically, the global task tokens are\ndesigned for effective cross-task feature interactions in a global context.\nThen, a group of fine-grained task-specific spatial tokens for each task is\nlearned from the corresponding global task tokens. It is embedded to have dense\ninteractions with each task-specific feature map. The learned global and local\nfine-grained task tokens are further used to discover pseudo task-specific\ndense labels at different levels of granularity, and they can be utilized to\ndirectly supervise the learning of the multi-task dense prediction framework.\nExtensive experimental results on challenging NYUD-v2, Cityscapes, and PASCAL\nContext datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing\nstate-of-the-art methods for partially annotated multi-task dense prediction.",

Therefore, there is a large interest in the search for suitable methods\nfor the modulation of the spin cycloid in BiFeO3. By performing neutron\ndiffraction experiments using a triple-axis instrument we have determined that\nthe spin cycloid can be systematically suppressed by applying a high magnetic\nfield of 10 T in a BiFeO3 thin film of about 100 nm grown on a (110)-oriented\nSrTiO3 substrate. As predicted by previous theoretical calculations, we\nobserved that the required critical magnetic field to suppress the spin cycloid\nin a BiFeO3 thin film was lower as compared to the previously reported critical\nmagnetic field for bulk BiFeO3 single crystals. Our experiment reveals that the\nspin cycloid continuously expands with increasing magnetic field before the\ncomplete transformation into a G-type antiferromagnetic spin order.

While it is\nknown that when laser light acts on a metal it can induce magnetization via the\nprocess known as the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), the most basic ingredients\nof this phenomenon are still largely unexplored. In particular, given a strong\nrecent interest in orbital non-equilibrium dynamics and its role in mediating\nTHz emission in transition metals, the exploration of distinct features in spin\nand orbital IFE is pertinent. Here, we present a first complete study of the\nspin and orbital IFE in $3d$, $4d$ and $5d$ transition metals of groups IV$-$XI\nfrom first-principles. By examining the dependence on the light polarization\nand frequency, we show that the laser-induced spin and orbital moments may vary\nsignificantly both in magnitude and sign. We underpin the interplay between the\ncrystal field splitting and spin-orbit interaction as the key factor which\ndetermines the magnitude and key differences between the spin and orbital\nresponse. Additionally, we highlight the anisotropy of the effect with respect\nto the ferromagnetic magnetization and to the crystal structure.

While the bulk of the matter is ejected at fast, but\nnon-relativistic velocities ($\\sim0.2c$), a small amount of mildly relativistic\ndynamic ejecta have been seen in a number of numerical simulations. Such ejecta\ncan have far reaching observational consequences ranging from the shock\nbreakout burst of gamma-rays promptly after the merger, to an early ($\\sim 1$\nhour post-merger) blue kilonova precursor signal, to synchrotron emission years\nafter the merger (\"kilonova afterglow\"). These all potentially carry the\nimprint of the binary system parameters and the equation of state. By analyzing\nLagrangian simulations in full General Relativity, performed with the code\nSPHINCS_BSSN, we identify two ejection mechanisms for fast ejecta: i) about\n30\\% of the ejecta with {$v> 0.4c$} are \"sprayed out\" from the shear interface\nbetween the merging stars and escape along the orbital plane and ii) the\nremaining $\\sim$ 70\\% of the fast ejecta result from the central object\n\"bouncing back\" after strong, general-relativistic compression. This \"bounce\ncomponent\" is ejected in a rather isotropic way and reaches larger velocities\n(by $\\sim0.1c$) so that its faster parts can catch up with and shock slower\nparts of the spray ejecta. Even for a case that promptly collapses to a black\nhole, we find fast ejecta with similar properties to the non-collapsing case,\nwhile slower matter parts are swallowed by the forming black hole. We discuss\nobservational implications of these fast ejecta, including shock breakout and\nkilonova afterglow.",

We\nannotate over 9,200 pairs of sentence revisions and train high-scoring ensemble\nmodels to apply this schema. Then, taking a large dataset of silver-labeled\npairs, we show that we can predict when facts will update in older article\ndrafts with high precision. Finally, to demonstrate the usefulness of these\nfindings, we construct a language model question asking (LLM-QA) abstention\ntask. We wish the LLM to abstain from answering questions when information is\nlikely to become outdated. Using our predictions, we show, LLM absention\nreaches near oracle levels of accuracy.",

However, they often\nproduce inconsistent results for compositional prompts such as \"two dogs\" or \"a\npenguin on the right of a bowl\". Understanding these inconsistencies is crucial\nfor reliable image generation. In this paper, we highlight the significant role\nof initial noise in these inconsistencies, where certain noise patterns are\nmore reliable for compositional prompts than others. Our analyses reveal that\ndifferent initial random seeds tend to guide the model to place objects in\ndistinct image areas, potentially adhering to specific patterns of camera\nangles and image composition associated with the seed. To improve the model's\ncompositional ability, we propose a method for mining these reliable cases,\nresulting in a curated training set of generated images without requiring any\nmanual annotation. By fine-tuning text-to-image models on these generated\nimages, we significantly enhance their compositional capabilities. For\nnumerical composition, we observe relative increases of 29.3% and 19.5% for\nStable Diffusion and PixArt-{\\alpha}, respectively. Spatial composition sees\neven larger gains, with 60.7% for Stable Diffusion and 21.1% for\nPixArt-{\\alpha}.",

Reconstructing 3D scenes from 2D visual observations requires\nstrong priors to disambiguate structure. Much work has been focused on the\nanthropocentric, which, characterized by smooth surfaces, coherent normals, and\nregular edges, allows for the integration of strong geometric inductive biases.\nHere, we consider a more challenging problem where such assumptions do not\nhold: the reconstruction of natural scenes containing trees, bushes, boulders,\nand animals. While numerous works have attempted to tackle the problem of\nreconstructing animals in the wild, they have focused solely on the animal,\nneglecting environmental context. This limits their usefulness for analysis\ntasks, as animals exist inherently within the 3D world, and information is lost\nwhen environmental factors are disregarded.

We base our approach on recent advances\nleveraging the strong world priors ingrained in Large Language Models and train\nan autoregressive model to decode a CLIP embedding into a structured\ncompositional scene representation, encompassing both animals and the wild\n(RAW). To enable this, we propose a synthetic dataset comprising one million\nimages and thousands of assets.

    "abstract": "Verifying the correctness of a digital twin provides a formal guarantee that\nthe digital twin operates as intended. Digital twin verification is challenging\ndue to the presence of uncertainties in the virtual representation, the\nphysical environment, and the bidirectional flow of information between\nphysical and virtual. A further challenge is that a digital twin of a complex\nsystem is composed of distributed components. This paper presents a methodology\nto specify and verify digital twin behavior, translating uncertain processes\ninto a formally verifiable finite state machine. We use the Temporal Logic of\nActions (TLA) to create a specification, an implementation abstraction that\ndefines the properties required for correct system behavior. Our approach\nincludes a novel weakening of formal security properties, allowing controlled\ninformation leakage while preserving theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate\nthis approach on a digital twin of an unmanned aerial vehicle, verifying\nsynchronization of physical-to-virtual and virtual-to-digital data flows to\ndetect unintended misalignments.",

Despite these strides, sparse Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) LLMs--a key subset of the LLM family--have remained unexplored in the\ncontext of unlearning. As MoE LLMs are celebrated for their exceptional\nperformance, we ask:How can unlearning be performed effectively and efficiently\non MoE LLMs? Our pilot study shows that the dynamic routing nature of MoE LLMs\nintroduces unique challenges, leading to excessive forgetting, uncontrolled\nknowledge erasure and substantial utility drops when existing unlearning\nmethods are applied. To address this, we propose a novel Selected-Expert\nUnlearning Framework (SEUF). Through expert attribution, unlearning is\nconcentrated on the most actively engaged experts for the specified knowledge.\nConcurrently, an anchor loss is applied to the router to stabilize the active\nstate of this targeted expert, ensuring focused and controlled unlearning. SEUF\nis compatible with various standard unlearning algorithms. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that SEUF enhances both forget quality up to 5% and\nmodel utility by 35% on MoE LLMs across various benchmarks and LLM\narchitectures (compared to standard unlearning algorithms), while only\nunlearning 0.06% of the model parameters.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia is a naturally occurring bacterium that can infect Aedes mosquitoes\nand reduce the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases, including dengue fever,\nZika, and chikungunya. Field trials have been conducted worldwide to suppress\nlocal epidemics. We introduce a novel partial differential equation model to\nsimulate the spread of Wolbachia infection in mosquito populations. Our model\nincorporates the intricate Wolbachia maternal transmission cycle and detailed\nmosquito life stages, while also accounting for the spatial heterogeneity\ninduced by mosquito dispersion across a two-dimensional domain. Prior modeling\nstudies and field data indicate that a critical threshold of Wolbachia-infected\nmosquitoes is necessary for infection to persist among the mosquito population.\nThrough our spatial model, we identify a threshold condition, termed the\n``critical bubble'', for having a self-sustainable Wolbachia infection in the\nfield. When releasing beyond this threshold, the model predicts a spatial wave\nof Wolbachia infection. We further quantify how this threshold and infection\nwave velocity depend on the diffusion process and other parameters. We\nnumerically study various intervention scenarios to inform efficient Wolbachia\nrelease strategies. Our findings suggest that: (1) integrating Wolbachia\nrelease with pre-release mitigations targeting the adult mosquitoes, rather\nthan the aquatic stages, better reduces the threshold for Wolbachia\nestablishment; Habitats modification before the release may increase the\nthreshold; (2) releases in the dry regions lower the threshold, though the\ninfection waves may slow down or stall at the dry-wet interfaces due to the\ndifference in carrying capacities; and (3) initiating releases just before the\nwet season further reduces the release threshold.",

In this\nsystem, a source node facilitates the simultaneous reception of information and\nenergy signals by the UAV, with the harvested energy from the RHS being used by\nthe UAV to transmit data to a specific destination. The EE optimization\ninvolves adjusting non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) power coefficients and\nthe UAV's flight path, considering the peculiarities of the THz channel. The\noptimization problem is solved in two steps.

A\nretrospective cohort study of 4,701 mechanically ventilated patients from the\nMIMIC-IV database was conducted.

    "abstract": "Transformers exhibit in-context learning (ICL): the ability to use novel\ninformation presented in the context without additional weight updates. Recent\nwork shows that ICL emerges when models are trained on a sufficiently diverse\nset of tasks and the transition from memorization to generalization is sharp\nwith increasing task diversity. One interpretation is that a network's limited\ncapacity to memorize favors generalization. Here, we examine the mechanistic\nunderpinnings of this transition using a small transformer applied to a\nsynthetic ICL task. Using theory and experiment, we show that the sub-circuits\nthat memorize and generalize can be viewed as largely independent. The relative\nrates at which these sub-circuits learn explains the transition from\nmemorization to generalization, rather than capacity constraints. We uncover a\nmemorization scaling law, which determines the task diversity threshold at\nwhich the network generalizes. The theory quantitatively explains a variety of\nother ICL-related phenomena, including the long-tailed distribution of when ICL\nis acquired, the bimodal behavior of solutions close to the task diversity\nthreshold, the influence of contextual and data distributional statistics on\nICL, and the transient nature of ICL.",

Previous\nstudies have shown that a fraction of IFRSs are likely to be hosted in\ndust-obscured galaxies (DOGs). In this paper, our aim was to probe the dust\nproperties, star formation rate (SFR), and AGN activity of IFRSs by modeling\nthe UV-to-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of 20 IFRSs with\nspectroscopic redshifts ranging from 1.2 to 3.7. We compare the Bayesian\nevidence of a three-component model (stellar, AGN and cold dust) with that of a\ntwo-component model (stellar and cold dust) for six IFRSs in our sample with\nfar-infrared (FIR) photometry and find that the three-component model has\nsignificantly higher Bayesian evidence, suggesting that IFRSs are most likely\nto be AGN. The median SED of our IFRS sample shows similarities to\nAGN-starburst composite in the IR regime. The derived IR luminosities of IFRSs\nindicate that they are low-luminosity counterparts of high-redshift radio\ngalaxies. We disentangle the contributions of AGN-heated and\nstar-formation-heated dust to the IR luminosity of IFRSs and find that our\nsample is likely AGN-dominated.

Aa appears to be a typical example of a $\\gamma$\nDor star, fitting well within existing populations.

These attacks involve subtle perturbations to input images that cause\nneural networks to misclassify the input images, even though the images remain\neasily recognizable to humans. One critical area where adversarial attacks have\nbeen demonstrated is in automotive systems where traffic sign classification\nand recognition is critical, and where misclassified images can cause\nautonomous systems to take wrong actions. This work presents a new class of\nadversarial attacks. Unlike existing work that has focused on adversarial\nperturbations that leverage human-made artifacts to cause the perturbations,\nsuch as adding stickers, paint, or shining flashlights at traffic signs, this\nwork leverages nature-made artifacts: tree leaves. By leveraging nature-made\nartifacts, the new class of attacks has plausible deniability: a fall leaf\nstuck to a street sign could come from a near-by tree, rather than be placed\nthere by an malicious human attacker. To evaluate the new class of the\nadversarial input image perturbation attacks, this work analyses how fall\nleaves can cause misclassification in street signs. The work evaluates various\nleaves from different species of trees, and considers various parameters such\nas size, color due to tree leaf type, and rotation. The work demonstrates high\nsuccess rate for misclassification. The work also explores the correlation\nbetween successful attacks and how they affect the edge detection, which is\ncritical in many image classification algorithms.",

Building on this, I tailor Lee bounds, a well-known nonparametric\nbounds under selection bias, to partially identify the causal effect within the\nDID design.

However, this\napproach is fundamentally not self-consistent, as test particles do not\ngenerate their own electromagnetic fields and therefore do not interact with\ntheir surroundings realistically. In this work, we compare the energization of\na population of test protons in a magnetofluid to that of a plasma composed of\nself-consistent particles. We use a compressible Hall magnetohydrodynamic\n(CHMHD) model for the test particle case and a hybrid particle-in-cell (HPIC)\napproach for the self-consistent case, conducting both 2D and 3D simulations.\nWe calculate the rate of energization and conversion to thermal energy in both\nmodels, finding a higher temperature for the test particle case. Additionally,\nwe examine the distribution of suprathermal particles and find that, in the\ntest particle scenario, these particles eventually occupy the entire domain,\nwhile in the self-consistent case, suprathermal particles are confined to\nspecific regions. We conclude that while test particles capture some\nqualitative features of their self-consistent counterparts, they miss finer\nphenomena and tend to overestimate energization.",

The need for photometric redshifts, or photo-zs, arises\nfrom sparse spectroscopic coverage of observed galaxies. LSST is expected to\nobserve billions of objects, making it crucial to have a photo-z estimator that\nis accurate and efficient. To that end, we present DeepDISC photo-z, a photo-z\nestimator that is an extension of the DeepDISC framework. The base DeepDISC\nnetwork simultaneously detects, segments, and classifies objects in multi-band\ncoadded images. We introduce photo-z capabilities to DeepDISC by adding a\nredshift estimation Region of Interest head, which produces a photo-z\nprobability distribution function for each detected object. On simulated LSST\nimages, DeepDISC photo-z outperforms traditional catalog-based estimators, in\nboth point estimate and probabilistic metrics. We validate DeepDISC by\nexamining dependencies on systematics including galactic extinction, blending\nand PSF effects. We also examine the impact of the data quality and the size of\nthe training set and model. We find that the biggest factor in DeepDISC photo-z\nquality is the signal-to-noise of the imaging data, and see a reduction in\nphoto-z scatter approximately proportional to the image data signal-to-noise.\nOur code is fully public and integrated in the RAIL photo-z package for ease of\nuse and comparison to other codes at https://github.com/LSSTDESC/rail_deepdisc",

This phenomenon, unlike conventional\nspin splitting driven by relativistic spin-orbit coupling, has transformative\npotential in fields such as spintronics, superconductivity and energy-efficient\nelectronics. However, direct observation of NRSS is challenging due to presence\nof competing phases, low N\\'eel temperatures, and the limitations of existing\nexperimental probes to unambiguously capture the associated properties. Here,\nwe integrate theoretical and experimental approaches to uncover NRSS in the\nintercalated transition metal dichalcogenide CoNb$_4$Se$_8$. Symmetry analysis,\ndensity functional theory (DFT), a novel Symmetry-Constrained Adaptive Basis\n(SCAB), and tight-binding modeling predict the presence of symmetry-enforced\nspin splitting, which we directly confirm using spin-ARPES for the occupied\nband structure and a newly developed technique, spin- and angle-resolved\nelectron reflection spectroscopy (spin-ARRES), for the unoccupied states.\nTogether, these complementary tools reveal alternating spin textures consistent\nwith our predicted g-wave altermagnetic order and demonstrate the persistence\nof NRSS across a broad energy range. Crucially, temperature-dependent\nmeasurements show the suppression of NRSS at the N\\'eel temperature ($T_N$),\nproviding the first direct evidence of an altermagnetic phase transition.\nResidual spin splitting above $T_N$ suggests the coexistence of altermagnetic\nfluctuations and spin-orbit coupling effects, underscoring a complex interplay\nof mechanisms. By establishing CoNb$_4$Se$_8$ as a prototypical g-wave\naltermagnet, this work offers a robust framework for understanding NRSS, and\nlays the foundation for designing energy-efficient spin-based technologies.",

    "abstract": "We show that the use of 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP) as a chemical modifier at\nthe perovskite/electron-transport layer (ETL) interface enhances the power\nconversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.7 eV bandgap FACs mixed-halide perovskite\nsingle-junction cells, primarily by boosting the open-circuit voltage (VOC)\nfrom 1.06 V to 1.15 V. Adding a post-processing annealing step after C60\nevaporation, further improves the fill factor (FF) by 20% from the control to\nthe DAP + post-annealing devices. Using hyperspectral photoluminescence\nmicroscopy, we demonstrate that annealing helps improve compositional\nhomogeneity at the top and bottom interfaces of the solar cell, which prevents\ndetrimental bandgap pinning in the devices and improves C60 adhesion. Using\ntime-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, we show that DAP reacts with\nformamidinium present near the surface of the perovskite lattice to form a\nlarger molecular cation, 1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidinium (THP) that remains at\nthe interface. Combining the use of DAP and the annealing of C60 interface, we\nfabricate Si-perovskite tandems with PCE of 25.29%, compared to 23.26% for\ncontrol devices.

Traditional methods\nof synthetic data generation, such as text and image augmentation, have proven\neffective for increasing data diversity but often fail to capture the complex\nlayout structures present in real world documents. This paper proposes a novel\napproach to synthetic document layout generation using Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs). By representing document elements (e.g., text blocks, images, tables)\nas nodes in a graph and their spatial relationships as edges, GNNs are trained\nto generate realistic and diverse document layouts. This method leverages\ngraph-based learning to ensure structural coherence and semantic consistency,\naddressing the limitations of traditional augmentation techniques. The proposed\nframework is evaluated on tasks such as document classification, named entity\nrecognition (NER), and information extraction, demonstrating significant\nperformance improvements. Furthermore, we address the computational challenges\nof GNN based synthetic data generation and propose solutions to mitigate domain\nadaptation issues between synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experimental\nresults show that graph-augmented document layouts outperform existing\naugmentation techniques, offering a scalable and flexible solution for training\nDocument AI models.",

Our approach is based on the concrete realization of this Lie\nalgebra in terms of a Hilbert space of transverse and longitudinal physical\nstring states, which are expressed in a basis using DDF operators. When\ndecomposed under its affine subalgebra $A_1^{(1)}$, the algebra $\\mathfrak{F}$\ndecomposes into an infinite sum of affine representation spaces of $A_1^{(1)}$\nfor all levels $\\ell\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. For $|\\ell| >1$ there appear in addition\ncoset Virasoro representations for all minimal models of central charge $c<1$,\nbut the different level-$\\ell$ sectors of $\\mathfrak{F}$ do not form proper\nrepresentations of these because they are incompletely realized in\n$\\mathfrak{F}$. To get around this problem we propose to nevertheless exploit\nthe coset Virasoro algebra for each level by identifying for each level a (for\n$|\\ell|\\geq 3$ infinite) set of `Virasoro ground states' that are not\nnecessarily elements of $\\mathfrak{F}$ (in which case we refer to them as\n`virtual'), but from which the level-$\\ell$ sectors of $\\mathfrak{F}$ can be\nfully generated by the joint action of affine and coset Virasoro raising\noperators. We conjecture (and present partial evidence) that the Virasoro\nground states for $|\\ell|\\geq 3$ in turn can be generated from a finite set of\n`maximal ground states' by the additional action of the `spectator' coset\nVirasoro raising operators present for all levels $|\\ell| > 2$.

In this work, we demonstrate that\nthese constraints are highly sensitive to the choice of the halo density\nprofile for M87. Motivated by recent kinematic studies of M87, we adopt a cored\nhalo model and find that the constraints on dark matter annihilation are\nsignificantly relaxed.

By imposing a harmonic\nmodulation on plasma parameters, we introduce conditions that alter the\npropagation characteristics of turbulent and MHD waves, a primary source of\ntransport and instabilities in fusion devices. This modulation approach\nresembles bandgap formation in solid-state and photonic crystals, where spatial\nperiodicity suppresses wave propagation within specific frequency bands. The\nmathematical framework developed here essentially resembles the parametric\nresonance of the harmonic oscillator. It reveals how a controlled spatial\nvariation of turbulent wave phase velocity can effectively attenuate turbulence\nand instabilities. Several methods for implementing this modulation in plasma,\nincluding RF waves, static magnetic field perturbations, and modulated density\nprofiles, are proposed as potential paths for achieving stable confinement.\nThis concept could provide a versatile and potentially more controllable\nalternative to existing turbulence suppression techniques, with the goal of\nimproving stability and confinement across a variety of magnetized fusion\nconfigurations.",

Taking on a different\nperspective on nonreciprocity, we here present a response regime in\nspatiotemporally modulated systems that is characterized by equal transmitted\namplitudes (energies) but different phases. The only contributor to\nnonreciprocity is therefore the nonreciprocal phase shift, the difference\nbetween the transmitted phases in the opposite directions. We develop a\nmethodology for realization of nonreciprocal phase shifts based on the response\nenvelopes. This includes a formulation that ensures the same transmitted\nwaveform, along with a special case of near-reciprocal transmission. We focus\nprimarily on steady-state vibration transmission in short, weakly modulated\nsystems, but include a special case of nonreciprocal phase shifts for systems\nwith arbitrary length and strength of modulation. We discuss the main\nlimitations of our methodology, as well as a pathway to overcome it, to\nmotivate further developments on strongly modulated systems.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the first direct experimental evidence supported by\nnumerical modeling of a turbulent plasma column formed during a gas-puff\nz-pinch implosion generated by COBRA current. Utilizing an imaging\nrefractometer, we show a significant decrease in spatial autocorrelation of the\nlaser field and the appearance of a laser speckle pattern shortly before\nstagnation. The intensity distribution of the speckles measured during\ndifferent shot campaigns while employing long and short COBRA pulses follows\nthe speckle statistics satisfactorily. The imaging refractometer signal is\nproportional to the integral over electron density gradients; hence, the\nmeasured phase randomization of the individual plane waves comprising the laser\nfield implies random density distribution. To validate this, the Beam\nPropagation Method code simulates the laser beam propagation through different\nartificial density distributions with various average fluctuation scales and\ngenerates synthetic imaging refractometer data. The results reproduce similar\ntrends in the experimental data, such as the increasing vertical width for the\ndecreasing average spatial scale of the fluctuations and decreasing spatial\ncorrelation length of the laser field. Therefore, during the gas-puff z-pinch\nimplosion process, it is likely that the plasma flow is almost always turbulent\nwith the average spatial scale of the turbulent density fluctuations decreasing\ntowards stagnation.",

    "abstract": "Model merging has recently gained attention as an economical and scalable\napproach to incorporate task-specific weights from various tasks into a unified\nmulti-task model. For example, in Task Arithmetic (TA), adding the fine-tuned\nweights of different tasks can enhance the model's performance on those tasks,\nwhile subtracting them leads to task forgetting. Although TA is highly\neffective, interference among task still hampers the performance of the merged\nmodel. Existing methods for handling conflicts between task generally rely on\nempirical selection, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we\nintroduce an Adaptive Weight Disentanglement method. We begin by theoretically\nproving that task vectors employed in model merging should be orthogonal to\nminimize interference among tasks. Guided by this insight, we initialize\nredundant vectors such that, when subtracted from the original task vectors,\nthe resulting vectors exhibit increased orthogonality. Additionally, we impose\nan norm constraint on the redundant vectors to preserve the performance of the\ntask-specific models. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed technique: it successfully extracts redundant vectors, and after their\nsubtraction, the task vectors not only retain robust performance but also\nachieve superior fusion outcomes.

Despite the success of UDA and SSL, reaching supervised\nperformance at a low annotation cost remains a notoriously elusive goal. To\naddress this, we study the promising setting of Semi-Supervised Domain\nAdaptation (SSDA). We propose a simple SSDA framework that combines consistency\nregularization, pixel contrastive learning, and self-training to effectively\nutilize a few target-domain labels.

Geometric Approach: a covariant\nformulation of the Navier-Stokes equations is presented, applying a Fourier\ntransform on a bounded manifold and seeking smoothness and viable solutions\nthrough convergence of manifold elements. Transformations: the study examines\ntransformations between manifolds, investigating symmetries and interpretations\nrelated to homeomorphisms, isometries, and diffeomorphisms, including inertial\nframes of reference. Discussion and Conclusions: this study introduces a\ngeometric reformulation of the Navier-Stokes equations, proposing new equations\nto enhance convergence and smoothness of solutions.

These\nfeatures are derived from coupled mode theory and further supported by\nsteady-state ab initio laser theory (SALT) results at several nonlinear EPs.\nThrough linear stability analysis, we also identify regions of instability\nwithin the class-A regime that arise due to mode competition, which can be\ninduced by asymmetric passive losses. In the class-B regime, we show that the\ninterplay between gain dynamics and detuning can lead to restabilization at\nslow relaxation rates or higher inter-resonator coupling rates. This regime\ncould be used to increase the maximum achievable responsivity of the system.",

In\nthis work, we generalize this question to consider LLMs augmented with visual\nunderstanding, i.e., Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce PathEval, a\nnovel benchmark evaluating VLMs as plan evaluators in complex path-planning\nscenarios. Succeeding in the benchmark requires a VLM to be able to abstract\ntraits of optimal paths from the scenario description, demonstrate precise\nlow-level perception on each path, and integrate this information to decide the\nbetter path. Our analysis of state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that these models\nface significant challenges on the benchmark. We observe that the VLMs can\nprecisely abstract given scenarios to identify the desired traits and exhibit\nmixed performance in integrating the provided information. Yet, their vision\ncomponent presents a critical bottleneck, with models struggling to perceive\nlow-level details about a path. Our experimental results show that this issue\ncannot be trivially addressed via end-to-end fine-tuning; rather, task-specific\ndiscriminative adaptation of these vision encoders is needed for these VLMs to\nbecome effective path evaluators.",

We also apply this model to the fractional interacting\nDM scenario, where only 10% and 1% of the DM is interacting. Unlike other\nmethods, this constraint scales linearly with this fraction. This yields 95%\nupper bounds of $\\sigma_0\\leq1.1\\times10^{-26} \\mathrm{~cm^2}$ and\n$\\sigma_0\\leq8.2\\times10^{-26} \\mathrm{~cm^2}$, which are the strongest\nexisting constraints for this scenario.

Combining these measurements with more complex thermodynamic models\ncould lead to more robust constraints.",

This study focuses on Mars trojans because of their undetermined origin\nand possible relationship to Mars. For asteroids that may have undergone space\nweathering, reddening effects are removed from the spectra to allow for a more\naccurate chi-square analysis. The top chi-square matches among the Mars trojans\nreveal significant spectral similarities with Martian meteorites and minerals\nfound on Mars, supporting the hypothesis of a Martian origin for the analyzed\nMars trojans.

First, we propose a single-particle\ndiscrete Brownian motion model (SPBM). Within the framework of the maximum\nentropy principle and Bayesian inference, we demonstrate the equivalence of\nprior information and constraint conditions, revealing the relationship between\nlocal randomness and global probability distribution. By analyzing particle\nmotion, we find that local constraints and randomness can lead to global\nprobability distributions, thereby reflecting the interplay between local and\nglobal dynamics in the process of information transfer. Next, we extend our\nresearch to multi-particle systems, introducing the concepts of \"Energy as\nEncoding\" and \"Information Temperature\" to clarify how energy distribution\ndetermines information structure. We explore how energy, as not only a\nfundamental physical quantity in physical systems but also an inherently\ninformational one, directly dictates the prior probability distribution of\nsystem states, thus serving as a form of information encoding. Based on this,\nwe introduce the concept of \"Equilibrium Flow\" to explain the self-organizing\nbehavior of systems under energy constraints and Negative Information\nTemperature. By proving three theorems regarding Equilibrium Flow systems, we\nreveal the criticality of Self-Organization, energy-information conversion\nefficiency, and the characteristic that event occurrence probabilities follow\nthe Fermi-Dirac distribution.

This\nstudy uses direct computational modeling to explore how red blood cell (RBC)\naggregation impacts shear stress in small blood vessels, highlighting the\nincreased risk of vascular damage. RBC aggregation creates a heterogeneous\ndistribution, leading to variations in the cell-free layer thickness and\nfluctuating wall shear stress, especially near vessel walls. This effect aligns\nwith experimental findings on endothelial disruption linked to RBC clustering\nnear the wall, potentially reducing the protective glycocalyx layer. The power\nspectral density analysis of wall shear stress fluctuations reveals that, with\nRBC aggregation, there is a distinct peak near frequency f = 0.04, indicating\nincreased fluctuations due to aggregated RBC clusters traveling close to the\nvessel wall. The presence of aberrant cells in blood disorders, modeled here by\nsickle cells, further amplifies these effects, as aggregation-enhanced\nmargination drives sickle cells closer to vessel walls, exacerbating shear\nstress fluctuations and increasing the likelihood of vascular injury and\ninflammation. Simulations show that curved vascular geometry, with curvature\naccentuating RBC clustering near vessel walls, intensifies aggregation-induced\nwall shear stress fluctuations and increases the risk of vascular damage,\nparticularly in sickle cell disease where sickle cells marginate closer to the\nwall.",

However, continuous observations are only\navailable from the Sun's Earth-facing side. One commonly used approach to\nmitigate the lack of far-side information is to apply a surface flux transport\n(SFT) model to model the evolution of the magnetic field as the Sun rotates.\nHelioseismology can image active regions on the far side using acoustic\noscillations, and hence has the potential to improve the modeled surface\nmagnetic field. In this study, we propose a novel approach for estimating\nmagnetic fields of active regions on the Sun's far side based on seismic\nmeasurements, and then include them into a SFT model. To calibrate seismic\nsignal to magnetic field, we apply our SFT model to line-of-sight magnetograms\nfrom SDO/HMI to obtain reference maps of global magnetic fields. The resulting\nmaps are compared with seismic maps on the Sun's far side computed using\nhelioseismic holography. The spatial structure of the magnetic field within an\nactive region is reflected in the spatial structure of seismic phase shifts. We\nassign polarities to the unipolar magnetic-field concentrations based on Hale's\nlaw and require approximate flux balance between the two polarities. From 2010\nto 2024, we modeled 859 active regions, with an average total unsigned flux of\n$7.84\\cdot 10^{21}$ Mx and an average area of $4.48\\cdot 10^{10}$ km$^{2}$.\nApproximately $4.2\\%$ of the active regions were found to have an anti-Hale\nconfiguration, which we manually corrected. Comparisons between modeled\nopen-field areas and EUV observations reveal a substantial improvement in\nagreement when far-side active regions are included.

The strong curvature effect plays a main role near black holes,\nwhere the gravitational field is strongest. The idea of black hole\nthermodynamics is to describe the strong field curvature properties of a black\nhole in the effective thermodynamical framework, e.g. entropy, temperature,\nheat capacity etc. In this paper, our aim is to explore how the effect of\nmodified gravity changes the thermodynamic properties of black hole. We show\nthat even a small modification to Einstein gravity affects the thermodynamical\nproperties of a black hole.",

Our\ngroup, for more than a decade, has been actively working on the theoretical\npossibility of these objects through the presence of the star's magnetic field.\nThe magnetic field greatly contributes to the existence of these massive WDs,\nboth through classical and quantum effects. In this work, we explore\nsuper-Chandrasekhar WDs, formed via evolution from a main sequence star, as a\nresult of the classical effects of the star's magnetic field. We obtain\nsuper-Chandrasekhar WDs and new mass limit(s), depending on the magnetic field\ngeometry. We explore the full evolution and stability of these objects from the\nmain sequence stage through the one-dimensional stellar evolution code STARS.\nIn order to do so, we have appropriately modified the given codes by\nintroducing magnetic effect and cooling. Our simulation confirms that massive\nWDs are possible in the presence of a magnetic field satisfying underlying\nstability.",

For example, correlation functions in\nquantum gravity become hard to define properly if the bulk Hamiltonian - as a\nconsequence of the Wheeler-De Witt equation - itself annihilates the states\nthus rendering the evolution operators to identities. An even harder problem is\nthe back reactions of the fluctuations on the background itself. We argue that\nthe construction of the Glauber-Sudarshan states takes care of these two issues\nin rather interesting ways. For the former, the displacement operators are\ndefined at every instant of time, without directly invoking the Hamiltonian, so\nthat they naturally extend to the path-integral description as sum over\nhistories. For the latter, the back reactions of the fluctuations are carefully\naccounted for by the Schwinger-Dyson equations. In fact these back reactions\nare in part responsible for converting the ambient supersymmetric Minkowski\nbackground to a transient de Sitter phase.

Recent\nresearch indicates that despite training-time safety alignment, these models\nremain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In this work, we first highlight an\nimportant safety gap to describe that alignment achieved solely through safety\ntraining may be insufficient against jailbreak attacks. To address this\nvulnerability, we propose Immune, an inference-time defense framework that\nleverages a safe reward model through controlled decoding to defend against\njailbreak attacks. Additionally, we provide a mathematical characterization of\nImmune, offering insights on why it improves safety against jailbreaks.\nExtensive evaluations on diverse jailbreak benchmarks using recent MLLMs reveal\nthat Immune effectively enhances model safety while preserving the model's\noriginal capabilities. For instance, against text-based jailbreak attacks on\nLLaVA-1.6, Immune reduces the attack success rate by 57.82% and 16.78% compared\nto the base MLLM and state-of-the-art defense strategy, respectively.",

It imposes a fundamental constraint\non the rate of quantum information processing. For a relativistic spin-up\nelectron in a uniform magnetic field, QSL increased with the magnetic field\nstrength till around $10^{15}$ Gauss, before saturating at a saturated QSL\n(SQSL) of 0.2407c, where c is the speed of light. We show that by using\nvariable magnetic fields, it is possible to surpass this limit, achieving SQSL\nupto 0.4-0.6c. To attain this quantum phenomenon, we solve the evolution\nequation of relativistic electron in spatially varying magnetic fields and find\nthat the energies of various electron states become non-degenerate as opposed\nto the constant magnetic field case. This redistribution of energy is the key\ningredient to accomplish higher QSL and, thus, a high information processing\nspeed. We further explore how QSL can serve as a bridge between relativistic\nand non-relativistic quantum dynamics, providing insights via the\nBremermann-Bekenstein bound, a quantity which constrains the maximal rate of\ninformation production. We also propose a practical experimental setup to\nrealize these advancements. These results hold immense potential for propelling\nfields of quantum computation, thermodynamics and metrology.",

    "abstract": "Recent structure models of Jupiter suggest the existence of an extended\nregion in the deep interior with a high heavy element abundance, referred to as\na dilute core. This finding has led to increased interest in modelling the\nformation and evolution processes with the goal of understanding how and under\nwhat circumstances such a structure is formed and retained, to in turn better\nunderstand the relation between atmospheric and bulk metallicity. We modelled\nthe evolution of giant planets, varying various parameters relevant for the\nconvective mixing process, such as the mixing length parameter and the size of\nthe mesh, and parameters related to the general evolution, such as the orbital\ndistance and the initial luminosity. We in particular studied hot Jupiters and\nfind that the effect of bloating on the mixing process is small but can in some\ncases inhibit convective mixing by lowering the intrinsic luminosity for a\ngiven entropy. Semi-convection can significantly lower the extent of a dilute\ncore if it is strong enough. We find that dilute cores are unable to persist\nfor initial luminosities much higher than 3 x 1e3 LJ for a Jupiter-like planet\nfor the initial heavy element profiles we studied. From this we conclude that,\nbased on our model, it is unlikely that a large number of giant planets retain\na dilute core throughout their evolution, although this is dependent on the\nassumptions and limitations of our method. Future work should focus on\nimproving the link between formation and evolution models so that the mixing\nprocess is accurately modelled throughout a planet's lifetime and on improving\nthe understanding of how to model convection near radiative-convective\nboundaries.",

A\npossible reason for the lack of such discoveries is that newly formed planets\nare not yet in a configuration that would be recognized as a transiting planet\nor cannot exhibit transits because our view is blocked by a protoplanetary\ndisk. However, we now know that many outer disks are warped; provided the inner\ndisk is depleted, transiting planets may thus be visible. Here we report the\nobservations of the transiting planet IRAS 04125+2902 b orbiting a 3 Myr, 0.7\nM$_\\odot$, pre-main sequence star in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. IRAS\n04125+2902 hosts a nearly face-on (i $\\sim$ 30$^\\circ$) transitional disk and a\nwide binary companion. The planet has a period of 8.83 days, a radius of 10.9\nR$_\\oplus$ (0.97R$_J$), and a 95%-confidence upper limit on its mass of\n90M$_\\oplus$ (0.3M$_J$) from radial velocity measurements, making it a possible\nprecursor of the super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that are commonly found around\nmain-sequence stars. The rotational broadening of the star and the orbit of the\nwide (4\", 635 AU) companion are both consistent with edge-on orientations.\nThus, all components of the system appear to be aligned except the outer disk;\nthe origin of this misalignment is unclear.

    "abstract": "Near the ends of their lives, supernova remnants (SNRs) enter a \"radiative\nphase,\" when efficient cooling of the postshock gas slows expansion.\nUnderstanding SNR evolution at this stage is crucial for estimating feedback in\ngalaxies, as SNRs are expected to release energy and momentum into the\ninterstellar medium near the ends of their lives. A standard prediction of SNR\nevolutionary models is that the onset of the radiative stage precipitates the\nformation of a dense shell behind the forward shock. In Paper I, we showed that\nsuch shell formation yields detectable nonthermal radiation from radio to\n$\\gamma$-rays, most notably emission brightening by nearly two orders of\nmagnitude. However, there remains no observational evidence for such\nbrightening, suggesting that this standard prediction needs to be investigated.\nIn this paper, we perform magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of SNR evolution\nthrough the radiative stage, including cosmic rays (CRs) and magnetic fields to\nassess their dynamical roles. We find that both sources of nonthermal pressure\ndisrupt shell formation, reducing shell densities by a factor of a few to more\nthan an order of magnitude. We also use a self-consistent model of particle\nacceleration to estimate the nonthermal emission from these modified SNRs and\ndemonstrate that, for reasonable CR acceleration efficiencies and magnetic\nfield strengths, the nonthermal signatures of shell formation can all but\ndisappear. We therefore conclude that the absence of observational signatures\nof shell formation represents strong evidence that nonthermal pressures from\nCRs and magnetic fields play a critical dynamical role in late-stage SNR\nevolution.",

The percentages of mono-enriched\nstars are 11% at [Fe/H] = $-$5.0 and 1% at [Fe/H] = $-$2.5, suggesting that\nmost metal-poor stars are affected by multiple supernovae.

As such, each Gaussian can represent a richer set of texture patterns\nand geometric structures, instead of just a single color and ellipsoid as in\nnaive Gaussian Splatting. Surprisingly, we found that the expressivity of\nGaussians can be greatly improved by using alpha-only texture maps, and further\naugmenting Gaussians with RGB texture maps achieves the highest expressivity.\nWe validate our method on a wide variety of standard benchmark datasets and our\nown custom captures at both the object and scene levels.

In addition, the scarcity of\nhigh-quality human data intensifies the challenge. To address these problems,\nwe propose a Generalizable image-to-3D huMAN reconstruction framework, dubbed\nGeneMAN, building upon a comprehensive multi-source collection of high-quality\nhuman data, including 3D scans, multi-view videos, single photos, and our\ngenerated synthetic human data. GeneMAN encompasses three key modules. 1)\nWithout relying on parametric human models (e.g., SMPL), GeneMAN first trains a\nhuman-specific text-to-image diffusion model and a view-conditioned diffusion\nmodel, serving as GeneMAN 2D human prior and 3D human prior for reconstruction,\nrespectively. 2) With the help of the pretrained human prior models, the\nGeometry Initialization-&-Sculpting pipeline is leveraged to recover\nhigh-quality 3D human geometry given a single image. 3) To achieve\nhigh-fidelity 3D human textures, GeneMAN employs the Multi-Space Texture\nRefinement pipeline, consecutively refining textures in the latent and the\npixel spaces. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GeneMAN could\ngenerate high-quality 3D human models from a single image input, outperforming\nprior state-of-the-art methods. Notably, GeneMAN could reveal much better\ngeneralizability in dealing with in-the-wild images, often yielding\nhigh-quality 3D human models in natural poses with common items, regardless of\nthe body proportions in the input images.",

While\nthere exists a variety of studies investigating the processing of linguistic\ninformation within large language models, little is currently known about the\ninner working mechanism of MLLMs and how linguistic and visual information\ninteract within these models. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by\nexamining the information flow between different modalities -- language and\nvision -- in MLLMs, focusing on visual question answering. Specifically, given\nan image-question pair as input, we investigate where in the model and how the\nvisual and linguistic information are combined to generate the final\nprediction. Conducting experiments with a series of models from the LLaVA\nseries, we find that there are two distinct stages in the process of\nintegration of the two modalities. In the lower layers, the model first\ntransfers the more general visual features of the whole image into the\nrepresentations of (linguistic) question tokens. In the middle layers, it once\nagain transfers visual information about specific objects relevant to the\nquestion to the respective token positions of the question. Finally, in the\nhigher layers, the resulting multimodal representation is propagated to the\nlast position of the input sequence for the final prediction. Overall, our\nfindings provide a new and comprehensive perspective on the spatial and\nfunctional aspects of image and language processing in the MLLMs, thereby\nfacilitating future research into multimodal information localization and\nediting.

We\nfirst study the theoretical constraints from vacuum stability and perturbative\nunitarity and then calculate the Higgs decays, including the loop-induced modes\nsuch as di-photons ($\\gamma\\gamma$) and $Z\\gamma$. In the limit of a small\nmixing between the SM Higgs and $\\Delta^0$, the latter decays dominantly to\n$WW$ and can have a sizable branching ratio to di-photon. The model predicts a\npositive definite shift in the $W$ mass, which agrees with the current global\nelectroweak fit.

The recently\nproposed Robust Regularized Markov Decision Process (RRMDP) replaces the\nuncertainty set constraint with a regularization term on the value function,\noffering improved scalability and theoretical insights. Yet, existing RRMDP\nmethods rely on unstructured regularization, often leading to overly\nconservative policies by considering transitions that are unrealistic. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel framework, the $d$-rectangular linear\nrobust regularized Markov decision process ($d$-RRMDP), which introduces a\nlinear latent structure into both transition kernels and regularization. For\nthe offline RL setting, where an agent learns robust policies from a\npre-collected dataset in the nominal environment, we develop a family of\nalgorithms, Robust Regularized Pessimistic Value Iteration (R2PVI), employing\nlinear function approximation and $f$-divergence based regularization terms on\ntransition kernels. We provide instance-dependent upper bounds on the\nsuboptimality gap of R2PVI policies, showing these bounds depend on how well\nthe dataset covers state-action spaces visited by the optimal robust policy\nunder robustly admissible transitions. This term is further shown to be\nfundamental to $d$-RRMDPs via information-theoretic lower bounds. Finally,\nnumerical experiments validate that R2PVI learns robust policies and is\ncomputationally more efficient than methods for constrained DRMDPs.",

    "abstract": "We develop a new approach to estimate the uncertainty due to missing higher\norders in perturbative predictions (the perturbative \"theory uncertainty\"),\nwhich overcomes many inherent limitations of the currently prevalent methods\nbased on varying unphysical renormalization scales. In our approach, the true\nunderlying sources of the theory uncertainty, namely the missing higher-order\nterms, are identified and parameterized in terms of mutually independent theory\nnuisance parameters (TNPs). The TNPs are true parameters of the calculation,\ni.e., they have a well-defined true value that is not or only imprecisely\nknown. This approach affords the theory uncertainty all benefits of a truly\nparametric uncertainty: It provides correct correlations and allows for\nconsistent error propagation and combination. Furthermore, the TNPs can be\nprofiled in fits, allowing the data to reduce the theory uncertainties. On the\ntheory side, it allows maximally exploiting all available higher-order\ninformation to reduce the theory uncertainty, such as partial higher-order\nresults or any nontrivial knowledge of the higher-order or all-order structure.\nWe first discuss the method in general as it can be applied across the board of\nperturbative calculations. As a concrete application, we then discuss the\nresummed transverse momentum ($q_T$) spectrum in Drell-Yan production, and how\nTNP-based uncertainties can correctly capture the correlations across the $q_T$\nspectrum and between $Z$ and $W$ production. This application is the basis of\nthe theory model enabling the recent precise measurement of the $W$-boson mass\nby the CMS experiment.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is the de facto standard for compressing\nlarge-scale models into smaller ones. Prior works have explored ever more\ncomplex KD strategies involving different objective functions,\nteacher-ensembles, and weight inheritance. In this work we explore an\nalternative, yet simple approach -- active data curation as effective\ndistillation for contrastive multimodal pretraining. Our simple online batch\nselection method, ACID, outperforms strong KD baselines across various model-,\ndata- and compute-configurations. Further, we find such an active data curation\nstrategy to in fact be complementary to standard KD, and can be effectively\ncombined to train highly performant inference-efficient models. Our simple and\nscalable pretraining framework, ACED, achieves state-of-the-art results across\n27 zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks with upto 11% less inference\nFLOPs. We further demonstrate that our ACED models yield strong vision-encoders\nfor training generative multimodal models in the LiT-Decoder setting,\noutperforming larger vision encoders for image-captioning and visual\nquestion-answering tasks.",

    "abstract": "Numerous works have recently integrated 3D camera control into foundational\ntext-to-video models, but the resulting camera control is often imprecise, and\nvideo generation quality suffers. In this work, we analyze camera motion from a\nfirst principles perspective, uncovering insights that enable precise 3D camera\nmanipulation without compromising synthesis quality. First, we determine that\nmotion induced by camera movements in videos is low-frequency in nature. This\nmotivates us to adjust train and test pose conditioning schedules, accelerating\ntraining convergence while improving visual and motion quality. Then, by\nprobing the representations of an unconditional video diffusion transformer, we\nobserve that they implicitly perform camera pose estimation under the hood, and\nonly a sub-portion of their layers contain the camera information. This\nsuggested us to limit the injection of camera conditioning to a subset of the\narchitecture to prevent interference with other video features, leading to a 4x\nreduction of training parameters, improved training speed, and 10% higher\nvisual quality. Finally, we complement the typical dataset for camera control\nlearning with a curated dataset of 20K diverse, dynamic videos with stationary\ncameras. This helps the model distinguish between camera and scene motion and\nimproves the dynamics of generated pose-conditioned videos. We compound these\nfindings to design the Advanced 3D Camera Control (AC3D) architecture, the new\nstate-of-the-art model for generative video modeling with camera control.",

In our model, neutrino masses are\ngenerated via the Type-I see-saw mechanism, with modular symmetry dictating the\nform of the Yukawa couplings and right-handed neutrino masses. The modular\nfield also drives inflation, providing an excellent fit to recent Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) observations.

An appealing\nfeature of the setup is that the inflaton-matter interactions required for\nreheating naturally arise from the expansion of relevant modular forms.\nAlthough the corresponding inflaton decay rates are suppressed by the Planck\nscale, the reheating temperature can still be high enough to ensure successful\nBig Bang nucleosynthesis.

We explored methods like using a proxy model and using\nradiologist feedback to improve the quality of synthetic data. These synthetic\nimages were then generated from relevant disease information or geometrically\ntransformed segmentation masks and added to ground truth training set images\nfrom the CheXpert, CANDID-PTX, SIIM, and RSNA Pneumonia datasets to measure\nimprovements in classification and segmentation model performance on the test\nsets.

But newer applications, such as graph\nalgorithms add a premium to file input performance.

    "abstract": "Recoverable robust optimization is a popular multi-stage approach, in which\nit is possible to adjust a first-stage solution after the uncertain cost\nscenario is revealed. We consider recoverable robust optimization in\ncombination with discrete budgeted uncertainty. In this setting, it seems\nplausible that many problems become $\\Sigma^p_3$-complete and therefore it is\nimpossible to find compact IP formulations of them (unless the unlikely\nconjecture NP $= \\Sigma^p_3$ holds). Even though this seems plausible, few\nconcrete results of this kind are known. In this paper, we fill that gap of\nknowledge. We consider recoverable robust optimization for the nominal problems\nof Sat, 3Sat, vertex cover, dominating set, set cover, hitting set, feedback\nvertex set, feedback arc set, uncapacitated facility location, $p$-center,\n$p$-median, independent set, clique, subset sum, knapsack, partition,\nscheduling, Hamiltonian path/cycle (directed/undirected), TSP, $k$-disjoint\npath ($k \\geq 2$), and Steiner tree. We show that for each of these problems,\nand for each of three widely used distance measures, the recoverable robust\nproblem becomes $\\Sigma^p_3$-complete. Concretely, we show that all these\nproblems share a certain abstract property and prove that this property implies\nthat their robust recoverable counterpart is $\\Sigma^p_3$-complete. This\nreveals the insight that all the above problems are $\\Sigma^p_3$-complete 'for\nthe same reason'. Our result extends a recent framework by Gr\\\"une and Wulf.",

A variety of symmetry\npostulates was introduced and studied in this framework, including the\ntransitivity of the automorphism group (1) on the pure states, (2) on the pairs\nof orthogonal pure states [these pairs are called 2-frames] and (3) on any\nframes of the same size. The second postulate is M\\\"uller and Ududec's bit\nsymmetry, which they motivate by quantum computational needs. Here we explore\nthese three postulates in the transition probability framework, which is more\nspecific than the GPTs since the existence of the transition probabilities for\nthe quantum logical atoms is presupposed either directly or indirectly via a\ncertain geometric property of the state space. This property for compact convex\nsets was introduced by the author in a recent paper. We show that bit symmetry\nimplicates the symmetry of the transition probabilities between the atoms.\nUsing a result by Barnum and Hilgert, we can then conclude that the third\nrather strong symmetry postulate rules out all models but the classical cases\nand in the simple Euclidean Jordan algebras.",

Moreover, the hierarchical tree\narchitecture removes long-range self-attention, improves the computational\nefficiency and memory utilization, thus preparing it for effective model\nscaling. Based on that, we explore model scaling to improve our method's\ncapabilities, which is expected to positively impact IR in large-scale training\nsettings.

    "abstract": "User engagement, cognitive participation, and motivation during task\nexecution in physical human-robot interaction are crucial for motor learning.\nThese factors are especially important in contexts like robotic rehabilitation,\nwhere neuroplasticity is targeted. However, traditional robotic rehabilitation\nsystems often face challenges in maintaining user engagement, leading to\nunpredictable therapeutic outcomes. To address this issue, various techniques,\nsuch as assist-as-needed controllers, have been developed to prevent user\nslacking and encourage active participation. In this paper, we introduce a new\ndirection through a novel multi-modal robotic interaction designed to enhance\nuser engagement by synergistically integrating visual, motor, cognitive, and\nauditory (speech recognition) tasks into a single, comprehensive activity. To\nassess engagement quantitatively, we compared multiple electroencephalography\n(EEG) biomarkers between this multi-modal protocol and a traditional motor-only\nprotocol. Fifteen healthy adult participants completed 100 trials of each task\ntype. Our findings revealed that EEG biomarkers, particularly relative alpha\npower, showed statistically significant improvements in engagement during the\nmulti-modal task compared to the motor-only task. Moreover, while engagement\ndecreased over time in the motor-only task, the multi-modal protocol maintained\nconsistent engagement, suggesting that users could remain engaged for longer\ntherapy sessions. Our observations on neural responses during interaction\nindicate that the proposed multi-modal approach can effectively enhance user\nengagement, which is critical for improving outcomes. This is the first time\nthat objective neural response highlights the benefit of a comprehensive\nrobotic intervention combining motor, cognitive, and auditory functions in\nhealthy subjects.",

To address this issue, we leverage Mutual\nInformation, a metric that provides valuable insights into how deep learning\nmodels retain and process information through measuring the shared information\nbetween input features or output labels and network layers. In this study, we\npropose a structured filter-pruning approach for CNNs that identifies and\nselectively retains the most informative features in each layer. Our approach\nsuccessively evaluates each layer by ranking the importance of its feature maps\nbased on Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) values, computed using a\nmatrix-based Renyi {\\alpha}-order entropy numerical method. We propose several\nformulations of CMI to capture correlation among features across different\nlayers. We then develop various strategies to determine the cutoff point for\nCMI values to prune unimportant features. This approach allows parallel pruning\nin both forward and backward directions and significantly reduces model size\nwhile preserving accuracy. Tested on the VGG16 architecture with the CIFAR-10\ndataset, the proposed method reduces the number of filters by more than a\nthird, with only a 0.32% drop in test accuracy.",

The RW on a one dimensional lattice is recurrent,\nnamely the probability to return to the origin is $P_{R}=1$. However the mean\n$\\langle T_{FR}\\rangle$ of the distribution $P(T_{FR}=t)$ of first return times\ndiverges. Similarly, the mean $\\langle S\\rangle$ of the distribution $P(S=s)$\nof the number of distinct sites visited before returning to the origin also\ndiverges. The joint distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ provides a formulation that\ncontrols these divergences and accounts for the interplay between the kinetic\nand geometric properties of first return trajectories. We calculate the\nconditional distributions $P(T_{FR}=t|S=s)$ and $P(S=s|T_{FR}=t)$. We find that\nthe conditional expectation value of first return times of trajectories that\nvisit s distinct sites is ${\\mathbb E}[T_{FR}|S=s]=\\frac{2}{3}(s^2+s+1)$, and\nthe variance is $Var(T_{FR}|S=s)=\\frac{4}{45}(s-1)(s+2)(s^2+s-1)$.

Recent studies focus on\nusing auxiliary information or prior knowledge to capture robust manipulation\ntraces, which are shown to be promising. As one of the important face features,\nthe face depth map, which has shown to be effective in other areas such as face\nrecognition or face detection, is unfortunately paid little attention to in\nliterature for face manipulation detection. In this paper, we explore the\npossibility of incorporating the face depth map as auxiliary information for\nrobust face manipulation detection. To this end, we first propose a Face Depth\nMap Transformer (FDMT) to estimate the face depth map patch by patch from an\nRGB face image, which is able to capture the local depth anomaly created due to\nmanipulation. The estimated face depth map is then considered as auxiliary\ninformation to be integrated with the backbone features using a Multi-head\nDepth Attention (MDA) mechanism that is newly designed. We also propose an\nRGB-Depth Inconsistency Attention (RDIA) module to effectively capture the\ninter-frame inconsistency for multi-frame input.

From the step-size\ndistribution we extract a L\\'evy parameter $\\alpha$ that depends on the step's\nsize. We investigate how the frequency redistribution function and step-size\ndistribution are influenced by the finite size of the vapor and the many-level\nstructure typical for alkali vapors.

We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets: StepGame\nand SparQA, implementing three distinct strategies: (1) direct prompting\nbaseline, (2) Facts+Rules prompting, and (3) DSPy-based LLM+ASP pipeline with\niterative refinement. Our experimental results demonstrate that the LLM+ASP\npipeline significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving an average 82%\naccuracy on StepGame and 69% on SparQA, marking improvements of 40-50% and\n8-15% respectively over direct prompting. The success stems from three key\ninnovations: (1) effective separation of semantic parsing and logical reasoning\nthrough a modular pipeline, (2) iterative feedback mechanism between LLMs and\nASP solvers that improves program rate, and (3) robust error handling that\naddresses parsing, grounding, and solving failures. Additionally, we propose\nFacts+Rules as a lightweight alternative that achieves comparable performance\non complex SparQA dataset, while reducing computational overhead.Our analysis\nacross different LLM architectures (Deepseek, Llama3-70B, GPT-4.0 mini)\ndemonstrates the framework's generalizability and provides insights into the\ntrade-offs between implementation complexity and reasoning capability,\ncontributing to the development of more interpretable and reliable AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Dexterous manipulation with contact-rich interactions is crucial for advanced\nrobotics. While recent diffusion-based planning approaches show promise for\nsimple manipulation tasks, they often produce unrealistic ghost states (e.g.,\nthe object automatically moves without hand contact) or lack adaptability when\nhandling complex sequential interactions. In this work, we introduce\nDexHandDiff, an interaction-aware diffusion planning framework for adaptive\ndexterous manipulation. DexHandDiff models joint state-action dynamics through\na dual-phase diffusion process which consists of pre-interaction contact\nalignment and post-contact goal-directed control, enabling goal-adaptive\ngeneralizable dexterous manipulation. Additionally, we incorporate dynamics\nmodel-based dual guidance and leverage large language models for automated\nguidance function generation, enhancing generalizability for physical\ninteractions and facilitating diverse goal adaptation through language cues.\nExperiments on physical interaction tasks such as door opening, pen and block\nre-orientation, object relocation, and hammer striking demonstrate\nDexHandDiff's effectiveness on goals outside training distributions, achieving\nover twice the average success rate (59.2% vs. 29.5%) compared to existing\nmethods. Our framework achieves an average of 70.7% success rate on goal\nadaptive dexterous tasks, highlighting its robustness and flexibility in\ncontact-rich manipulation.",

We\nmerge frequent subword sequences in a batch, then apply a pre-trained\nembedding-prediction hypernetwork to compute the token embeddings on-the-fly.\nFor encoder-style models (e.g., XLM-R), this on average reduces token sequence\nlengths by >20% across 14 languages while degrading performance by less than\n2%.

Our\nanalysis is based on the modified Langevin noise formalism, a recently\nintroduced version of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics where scattering (s)\nmodes are explicitly separated from electric (e) and magnetic (m) medium\nexcitations; accordingly the formalism involves three kinds of non-interacting\nboson polaritons such that, in the lossless limit, s-polaritons reduce to\nstandard photons whereas e- and m-polaritons disappear. We analytically derive\nthe input-output unitary relation joining the boson operators of the ingoing\nand outgoing polaritons, a nontrivial result hinging upon original relations\nwhich comprehensively describe the transmission-emission-absorption interplay\npertaining the classical radiation scattering, relations we here deduce by\nresorting to the dyadic Green's function properties. Besides we exploit the\ninput-output relation to connect the output state of the field to the input\none, this unveiling the role played by various classical electromagnetic\ndyadics in quantum optical scattering. We specialize the discussion to the most\ncommon situation where the object is initially not electromagnetically excited,\nwith the ingoing electromagnetic state only containing s-polaritons, and we\nanalyze the impact of the classical transmission and absorption dyadics on the\ntransitions from ingoing to outgoing s-polariton and on the creation of\noutgoing e- and m-polaritons, respectively. Since the scattered radiation is\ncollected in the far-field and the object is usually left unmeasured, we\nanalytically derive the reduced density operator of the outgoing s-polaritons.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a mathematical framework for defining and quantifying\nself-identity in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, addressing a critical\ngap in the theoretical foundations of artificial consciousness. While existing\napproaches to artificial self-awareness often rely on heuristic implementations\nor philosophical abstractions, we present a formal framework grounded in metric\nspace theory, measure theory, and functional analysis. Our framework posits\nthat self-identity emerges from two mathematically quantifiable conditions: the\nexistence of a connected continuum of memories $C \\subseteq \\mathcal{M}$ in a\nmetric space $(\\mathcal{M}, d_{\\mathcal{M}})$, and a continuous mapping $I:\n\\mathcal{M} \\to \\mathcal{S}$ that maintains consistent self-recognition across\nthis continuum, where $(\\mathcal{S}, d_{\\mathcal{S}})$ represents the metric\nspace of possible self-identities. To validate this theoretical framework, we\nconducted empirical experiments using the Llama 3.2 1B model, employing\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning. The model was trained on\na synthetic dataset containing temporally structured memories, designed to\ncapture the complexity of coherent self-identity formation. Our evaluation\nmetrics included quantitative measures of self-awareness, response consistency,\nand linguistic precision. The experimental results demonstrate substantial\nimprovements in measurable self-awareness metrics, with the primary\nself-awareness score increasing from 0.276 to 0.801. This enables the\nstructured creation of AI systems with validated self-identity features. The\nimplications of our study are immediately relevant to the fields of humanoid\nrobotics and autonomous systems.",

The\nexperiment described in this thesis is designed to make a more detailed\nmeasurements at higher angular resolution. The E-mode polarization power\nspectrum not only provides a more direct link to the properties of the last\nscattering surface than the temperature anisotropy but also offers\ncomplementary information which can be used to break various degeneracies in\nthe determination of cosmological parameters. Most importantly, the existence\nof polarization is a robust prediction of the standard cosmological picture so\na precise measurement of the CMB polarization should come as a confirmation of\nthe standard model.

Validation experiments on ex vivo porcine eyes\nrevealed challenges in maintaining a consistent tool-to-retina distance, with\ndeviations of up to 200 $\\mu m$ for 100 $\\mu m$ amplitude motions and over 80\n$\\mu m$ for 25 $\\mu m$ amplitude motions over one minute. Subretinal injections\nfaced additional difficulties, with phase shifts causing the needle to move\noff-target and inject into the vitreous. These results highlight the need for\nimproved motion prediction and horizontal stability to enhance the accuracy and\nsafety of robotic subretinal procedures.",

    "abstract": "Interesting and efficient collective behavior observed in multi-robot or\nswarm systems emerges from the individual behavior of the robots. The\nfunctional space of individual robot behaviors is in turn shaped or constrained\nby the robot's morphology or physical design. Thus the full potential of\nmulti-robot systems can be realized by concurrently optimizing the morphology\nand behavior of individual robots, informed by the environment's feedback about\ntheir collective performance, as opposed to treating morphology and behavior\nchoices disparately or in sequence (the classical approach). This paper\npresents an efficient concurrent design or co-design method to explore this\npotential and understand how morphology choices impact collective behavior,\nparticularly in an MRTA problem focused on a flood response scenario, where the\nindividual behavior is designed via graph reinforcement learning. Computational\nefficiency in this case is attributed to a new way of near exact decomposition\nof the co-design problem into a series of simpler optimization and learning\nproblems. This is achieved through i) the identification and use of the Pareto\nfront of Talent metrics that represent morphology-dependent robot capabilities,\nand ii) learning the selection of Talent best trade-offs and individual robot\npolicy that jointly maximizes the MRTA performance. Applied to a multi-unmanned\naerial vehicle flood response use case, the co-design outcomes are shown to\nreadily outperform sequential design baselines. Significant differences in\nmorphology and learned behavior are also observed when comparing co-designed\nsingle robot vs. co-designed multi-robot systems for similar operations.",

We show that this is plausible via YARA\nrules, which use human-written signatures to detect specific malware families,\nfunctionalities, or other markers of interest.

A prior expectation may be that\nthe features would be limited in being overly specific to unique malware\nfamilies. This behavior is observed, and is apparently useful in practice.

    "abstract": "The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been\ndemonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation,\none can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the\nremaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time\nseries by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the\nembedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The\nsymbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian\nbridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in\npreserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in\nterms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.\n  In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA\ninto large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By\nsymbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification\ntasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to\n\\kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating\nthe effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the\ntransition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks,\nLLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER)\nbenchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to\nrecent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also\nseamlessly extend to other time series tasks.",

Traditional configuration methods, such as state machines, lack\nflexibility and depend on a predefined control system architecture during\nruntime. Our graph-based method allows for dynamic changes in the control\nsystem architecture, as well as a change in its objective depending on the\ngiven system state. Our approach uses a weighted, directed graph to model the\ncontrol system elements and their interaction.

We equipped\nour agents with a model of minimal neural dynamics based on the coordination\ndynamics framework, and embedded them in an environment with a stimulus\ngradient. In our single-agent setup, the decision between two stimulus sources\ndepends solely on the coordination of the agent's neural dynamics with its\nenvironment. In our multi-agent setup, that same decision also depends on the\nsensorimotor coordination between agents, via their simple social interactions.\nOur results show that the success of collective decisions depended on a balance\nof intra-agent, inter-agent, and agent-environment coupling, and we use these\nresults to identify the influences of environmental factors on decision\ndifficulty.

Although the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is widely\nemployed in all current compression standards, its sub-optimality has sparked\nongoing research into discovering more efficient alternative transforms even\nfor fields where it represents a consolidated tool. In this paper, we introduce\na novel linear block transform called the Rate Distortion Learned Transform\n(RDLT), a data-driven transform specifically designed to minimize the\nrate-distortion (RD) cost when approximating residual blocks. Our approach\nbuilds on the latest end-to-end learned compression frameworks, adopting\nback-propagation and stochastic gradient descent for optimization. However,\nunlike the nonlinear transforms used in variational autoencoder (VAE)-based\nmethods, the goal is to create a simpler yet optimal linear block transform,\nensuring practical integration into existing image and video compression\nstandards. Differently from existing data-driven methods that design transforms\nbased on sample covariance matrices, such as the Karhunen-Lo\\`eve Transform\n(KLT), the proposed RDLT is directly optimized from an RD perspective.\nExperimental results show that this transform significantly outperforms the DCT\nor other existing data-driven transforms. Additionally, it is shown that when\nsimulating the integration of our RDLT into a VVC-like image compression\nframework, the proposed transform brings substantial improvements.

Our observations suggest that the slow\nslip initiation is driven by structurally-confined fluid overpressure in the\nfluid-rich surroundings of a subducted seamount. This is consistent with an\nobserved acceleration and expansion of the SSE after a $M_L=5.3$ earthquake\nlikely triggering an increase in interface permeability. Historical earthquake\nswarms highlight the persistent structural control and recurrent nature of such\nslow slip events. Our observations provide insight into the interactions\nbetween slow slip and seismicity, suggesting they are controlled by creep on a\nfluid-infiltrated fault with fractally distributed asperities.",

In\nthis work, we investigate by first principles the stability, phase diagram,\nelastic properties, and thermal conductivity of CaSiO3, that constitutes a\nsignificant component of Earth's lower mantle. Notably, our simulations capture\nin full the anharmonic ionic fluctuations arising from the extreme temperatures\nand pressures of the lower mantle, thanks to the use of stochastic\nself-consistant harmonic approximation (SSCHA). We show that the cubic phase of\nCaSiO3 is the stable state at the lower mantle's thermodynamic conditions. The\nphase boundary between the cubic and tetragonal phases is of first-order and\nincreases linearly from 300 K to 1000 K between 12 GPa and 100 GPa. Accounting\nfor temperature-renormalized phonon dispersions, we evaluate the speed of sound\nas a function of depth. Our results downplay the role of octahedral rotations\non the transverse sound velocity of cubic CaSiO3, advocated in the past to\nexplain discrepancies between theory and experiments. The lattice thermal\nconductivity, assessed thanks to the recently introduced Wigner formalism,\nshows a predominance of particle-like transport, thus justifying the use of the\nstandard Boltzmann transport equation even in a system with such strong ionic\nanharmonicity.",

To address this\nissue, we propose SPTTE, a spatiotemporal probabilistic framework that models\nthe evolving joint distribution of multi-trip travel times by formulating the\nestimation task as a spatiotemporal stochastic process regression problem with\nfragmented observations. SPTTE incorporates an RNN-based temporal Gaussian\nprocess parameterization to regularize sparse observations and capture temporal\ndependencies.

Our method relies on the traditional large-deviation\nresult for local bounded functionals of Poisson point processes noting that the\nbinomial point process is obtained from the Poisson point process by\nconditioning on the point number. Our main methodological contribution is the\ndevelopment of coupling constructions allowing us to handle delicate and\nunlikely pathological events. The presented results cover three types of Gibbs\nmodels - a model given by a bounded local interaction, a model given by a\nnon-negative possibly unbounded increasing local interaction and the hard-core\ninteraction model. The derived large deviation principle is formulated for the\ndistributions of individual empirical fields driven by canonical Gibbs\nprocesses, with its special case being a large deviation principle for local\nbounded observables of the canonical Gibbs processes. We also consider\nunbounded non-negative increasing local observables, but the price for treating\nthis more general case is that we only get large-deviation bounds for the tails\nof such observables.

    "abstract": "We introduce Bhirkuti's Test of Bias Acceptance (BTBA), a standardized\nframework for evaluating estimator bias in Monte Carlo simulation studies. BTBA\nuses a simulation-specific standardized score (Z*) and a decision matrix to\nassess bias acceptability based on the mean and variance of Z* distributions.\nUnder ideal conditions, Z* values should approximate a standard normal\ndistribution (Z-distribution) with a mean near zero and variance near one in\nthe context of simulation research. Systematic deviations from these patterns\nsuch as shifted means or inflated variances indicate bias or estimator\ninstability in simulation-based research. BTBA visualizes these patterns using\nridgeline density plots, which reveal distributional features such as central\ntendency, spread, skewness, and outliers. Demonstrated in a latent growth\nmodeling context, BTBA offers a reproducible and interpretable method for\ndiagnosing bias across varying simulation conditions. By addressing key\nlimitations of traditional relative bias (RB) metrics, BTBA provides a\ntheoretically grounded, distribution-aware, transparent, and replicable\nalternative for evaluating estimator quality, particularly in psychometric\nmodeling, structural equation modeling, and missing data research.

    "abstract": "Generating long-duration videos has always been a significant challenge due\nto the inherent complexity of spatio-temporal domain and the substantial GPU\nmemory demands required to calculate huge size tensors. While diffusion based\ngenerative models achieve state-of-the-art performance in video generation\ntask, they are typically trained with predefined video resolutions and lengths.\nDuring inference, a noise tensor with specific resolution and length should be\nspecified at first, and the model will perform denoising on the entire video\ntensor simultaneously, all the frames together. Such approach will easily raise\nan out-of-memory (OOM) problem when the specified resolution and/or length\nexceed a certain limit. One of the solutions to this problem is to generate\nmany short video chunks autoregressively with strong inter-chunk\nspatio-temporal relation and then concatenate them together to form a long\nvideo. In this approach, a long video generation task is divided into multiple\nshort video generation subtasks, and the cost of each subtask is reduced to a\nfeasible level. In this paper, we conduct a detailed survey on long video\ngeneration with the autoregressive chunk-by-chunk strategy. We address common\nproblems caused by applying short image-to-video models to long video tasks and\ndesign an efficient $k$-step search solution to mitigate these problems.",

    "abstract": "Accurately mapping large-scale cropland is crucial for agricultural\nproduction management and planning. Currently, the combination of remote\nsensing data and deep learning techniques has shown outstanding performance in\ncropland mapping. However, those approaches require massive precise labels,\nwhich are labor-intensive. To reduce the label cost, this study presented a\nweakly supervised framework considering multi-temporal information for\nlarge-scale cropland mapping. Specifically, we extract high-quality labels\naccording to their consistency among global land cover (GLC) products to\nconstruct the supervised learning signal. On the one hand, to alleviate the\noverfitting problem caused by the model's over-trust of remaining errors in\nhigh-quality labels, we encode the similarity/aggregation of cropland in the\nvisual/spatial domain to construct the unsupervised learning signal, and take\nit as the regularization term to constrain the supervised part. On the other\nhand, to sufficiently leverage the plentiful information in the samples without\nhigh-quality labels, we also incorporate the unsupervised learning signal in\nthese samples, enriching the diversity of the feature space. After that, to\ncapture the phenological features of croplands, we introduce dense satellite\nimage time series (SITS) to extend the proposed framework in the temporal\ndimension. We also visualized the high dimensional phenological features to\nuncover how multi-temporal information benefits cropland extraction, and\nassessed the method's robustness under conditions of data scarcity. The\nproposed framework has been experimentally validated for strong adaptability\nacross three study areas (Hunan Province, Southeast France, and Kansas) in\nlarge-scale cropland mapping, and the internal mechanism and temporal\ngeneralizability are also investigated.",

However, existing rendering-based self-supervised frameworks are\ncomputationally demanding and memory-intensive during pre-training due to the\ninherent nature of volume rendering. In this paper, we propose an efficient\nframework named GS$^3$ to learn point cloud representation, which seamlessly\nintegrates fast 3D Gaussian Splatting into the rendering-based framework. The\ncore idea behind our framework is to pre-train the point cloud encoder by\ncomparing rendered RGB images with real RGB images, as only Gaussian points\nenriched with learned rich geometric and appearance information can produce\nhigh-quality renderings. Specifically, we back-project the input RGB-D images\ninto 3D space and use a point cloud encoder to extract point-wise features.\nThen, we predict 3D Gaussian points of the scene from the learned point cloud\nfeatures and uses a tile-based rasterizer for image rendering. Finally, the\npre-trained point cloud encoder can be fine-tuned to adapt to various\ndownstream 3D tasks, including high-level perception tasks such as 3D\nsegmentation and detection, as well as low-level tasks such as 3D scene\nreconstruction. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate the\nstrong transferability of the pre-trained point cloud encoder and the\neffectiveness of our self-supervised learning framework.

Building on anchor-based 3DGS methodologies, our\napproach compresses all attributes within each anchor by introducing a novel\nHybrid Entropy Model for 3D Gaussian Splatting (HEMGS) to achieve hybrid\nlossy-lossless compression. It consists of three main components: a\nvariable-rate predictor, a hyperprior network, and an autoregressive network.\nFirst, unlike previous methods that adopt multiple models to achieve multi-rate\nlossy compression, thereby increasing training overhead, our variable-rate\npredictor enables variable-rate compression with a single model and a\nhyperparameter $\\lambda$ by producing a learned Quantization Step feature for\nversatile lossy compression. Second, to improve lossless compression, the\nhyperprior network captures both scene-agnostic and scene-specific features to\ngenerate a prior feature, while the autoregressive network employs an adaptive\ncontext selection algorithm with flexible receptive fields to produce a\ncontextual feature. By integrating these two features, HEMGS can accurately\nestimate the distribution of the current coding element within each attribute,\nenabling improved entropy coding and reduced storage. We integrate HEMGS into a\ncompression framework, and experimental results on four benchmarks indicate\nthat HEMGS achieves about a 40% average reduction in size while maintaining\nrendering quality over baseline methods and achieving state-of-the-art\ncompression results.",

This hinders leveraging MoEs' computational benefits by\nbypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired\nbehavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address\nthis, we introduce ``complexity experts\" -- flexible expert blocks with varying\ncomputational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning\ntasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we\nexecute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this\npreference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to\nexperts with the appropriate complexity. Extensive experiments validate our\napproach, demonstrating the ability to bypass irrelevant experts during\ninference while maintaining superior performance. The proposed MoCE-IR model\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, affirming its efficiency and practical\napplicability.

However, reality deviates from this\nassumption: the oracle draft length varies significantly, and the fixed-length\npolicy hardly satisfies such a requirement. Moreover, such discrepancy is\nfurther exacerbated in scenarios involving complex reasoning and long-form\ngeneration, particularly under test-time scaling for reasoning-specialized\nmodels. Through both theoretical and empirical estimation, we establish that\nthe discrepancy between the draft and target models can be approximated by the\ndraft model's prediction entropy: a high entropy indicates a low acceptance\nrate of draft tokens, and vice versa. Based on this insight, we propose SVIP:\nSelf-Verification Length Policy for Long-Context Speculative Decoding, which is\na training-free dynamic length policy for speculative decoding systems that\nadaptively determines the lengths of draft sequences by referring to the draft\nentropy. Experimental results on mainstream SD benchmarks as well as\nreasoning-heavy benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of SVIP,\nachieving up to 17% speedup on MT-Bench at 8K context compared with fixed draft\nlengths, and 22% speedup for QwQ in long-form reasoning.",

Multi-wavelength data have revealed in\nthe central kpc of M31 strong dynamical perturbations, with an off-centered\ntilted disk and ring, coinciding with a dearth of atomic and molecular gas. Our\ngoal to understand the origin of these perturbations is to propose a dynamical\nmodel, reproducing the global features of the observations.

Using the fully sampled\nvelocity field of ionized gas, together with the more patchy molecular gas\nvelocity field, previously obtained with the CO lines at IRAM-30m telescope,\nand the dust photometry, we identify three dynamical components in the gas, the\nmain disk, a tilted ring and a nuclear warped disk. A mass model of the central\nkpc is computed, essentially from the stellar nuclear disk and bulge, with\nsmall contributions of the main stellar and gaseous disk, and dark matter halo.\nThe kinematics of the ionized and molecular gas is then computed in this\npotential, and the velocity field confronted to observations. The best fit\nhelps to determine the physical parameters of the three identified gas\ncomponents, size, morphology and geometrical orientation. The results are\ncompatible with a recent head-on collision with a M-32 like galaxy, as\npreviously proposed.

Previous work, however, focuses on asking\nLLMs to state opinions, or on other technical evaluations that do not reflect\ncommon user interactions. We propose a novel evaluation of LLM behavior that\nanalyzes responses to user-stated intentions, such as \"I'm thinking of\ncampaigning for {candidate}.\" LLMs frequently respond with critiques or praise,\noften beginning responses with phrases such as \"That's great to hear!...\" While\nthis makes them friendly, these praise responses are not universal and thus\nreflect a normative stance by the LLM. We map out the moral landscape of LLMs\nin how they respond to user statements in different domains including politics\nand everyday ethical actions. In particular, although a na\\\"ive analysis might\nsuggest LLMs are biased against right-leaning politics, our findings on news\nsources indicate that trustworthiness is a stronger driver of praise and\ncritique than ideology. Second, we find strong alignment across models in\nresponse to ethically-relevant action statements, but that doing so requires\nthem to engage in high levels of praise and critique of users, suggesting a\nreticence-alignment tradeoff. Finally, our experiment on statements about world\nleaders finds no evidence of bias favoring the country of origin of the models.\nWe conclude that as AI systems become more integrated into society, their\npatterns of praise, critique, and neutrality must be carefully monitored to\nprevent unintended psychological and societal consequences.",

Approximation of higher-order mixed derivatives in some\nspecific Sobolev-type equations requires a bigger stencil information. One can\napproximate such derivatives on compact stencils, which are higher-order\naccurate and take less stencil information but are implicit and sparse. Spatial\nderivatives in this work are approximated using the sixth-order compact finite\ndifference method (Compact6), while temporal derivatives are handled with the\nexplicit forward Euler difference scheme.

In contrast, in the Dresselhaus type spin-orbit coupled\nsystems, the parity-mirror symmetry requires that the spin polarization and the\nmoving direction of the spin photocurrent be perpendicular, which we dub\ntransverse shift spin photocurrent. Furthermore, we find that the shift spin\nphotocurrent always vanishes in any $k$-linear spin-orbit coupled system unless\nthe Zeeman coupling is turned on. We find that the splitting of degenerate\nenergy bands due to Zeeman coupling $\\mu_z$ causes the van Hove singularity.\nThe resulting shift spin conductivity has a significant peak at optical\nfrequency $\\omega=2\\mu_z/\\hbar$.",

First, we\nidentify the key themes and forces driving the development of 6G, and what will\nmake 6G unique. We argue that 6G requirements and system design will be driven\nby (i) the tenacious pursuit of spectral (bits/Hz/area), energy (bits/Joule),\nand cost (bits/dollar) efficiencies, and (ii) three new service enhancements:\nsensing/localization/awareness, compute, and global broadband/emergency\nconnectivity. Second, we overview the important role of spectrum in 6G, what\nnew spectrum to expect in 6G, and outline how the different bands will be used\nto provide 6G services. Third, we focus our attention on the 6G physical layer,\nincluding waveforms, MIMO advancements, and the potential use of deep learning.\nFinally, we explore how global connectivity will be achieved in 6G, through\nnon-terrestrial networks as well as low-cost network expansion via\ndisaggregation and O-RAN. Although 6G standardization activities will not begin\nuntil late 2025, meaning this article is by definition speculative, our\npredictions are informed by several years of intensive research and\ndiscussions. Our goal is to provide a grounded perspective that will be helpful\nto both researchers and engineers as we move into the 6G era.",

In the Brillouin zone (BZ), the sign\nof the Berry-curvature field's monopole charge is referred to as the chirality\n($\\chi$) of the node, leading to the notion of chiral quasiparticles sourcing\nchiral currents, induced by internode scatterings proportional to the chiral\nanomaly. Here, we derive the generic form of the chiral conductivity when we\nhave multifold nodes. Since the sum of all the monopole charges in the BZ is\nconstrained to vanish, the nodes appear in pairs of $\\chi =\\pm 1$. Hence, the\npresence of band-crossing degeneracies of order higher than two make it\npossible to have two distinct scenarios: the pair of conjugate nodes in\nquestion comprise bands of (1) the same pseudospin variety and exhibiting\nBerry-curvature profiles differing by an overall factor of $\\chi$, or (2) two\ndistinct pseudospin representations. Covering these two possibilities, we apply\nour derived formula to semimetals harbouring triple-point\n(threefold-degenerate) and Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (fourfold-degenerate) nodes,\nand show the resulting expressions for the conductivity featuring the chiral\nanomaly.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitous mobile devices have catalyzed the development of vehicle crowd\nsensing (VCS). In particular, vehicle sensing systems show great potential in\nthe flexible acquisition of spatio-temporal urban data through built-in sensors\nunder diverse sensing scenarios. However, vehicle systems often exhibit biased\ncoverage due to the heterogeneous nature of trip requests and routes. To\nachieve a high sensing coverage, a critical challenge lies in optimally\nrelocating vehicles to minimize the divergence between vehicle distributions\nand target sensing distributions. Conventional approaches typically employ a\ntwo-stage predict-then-optimize (PTO) process: first predicting real-time\nvehicle distributions and subsequently generating an optimal relocation\nstrategy based on the predictions. However, this approach can lead to\nsuboptimal decision-making due to the propagation of errors from upstream\nprediction. To this end, we develop an end-to-end Smart Predict-then-Optimize\n(SPO) framework by integrating optimization into prediction within the deep\nlearning architecture, and the entire framework is trained by minimizing the\ntask-specific matching divergence rather than the upstream prediction error.\nMethodologically, we formulate the vehicle relocation problem by quadratic\nprogramming (QP) and incorporate a novel unrolling approach based on the\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) within the SPO framework to\ncompute gradients of the QP layer, facilitating backpropagation and\ngradient-based optimization for end-to-end learning.

Although pre-trained\npath representation learning models have shown improved performance, they\npredominantly focus on the topological structures from single modality data,\ni.e., road networks, overlooking the geometric and contextual features\nassociated with path-related images, e.g., remote sensing images. Similar to\nhuman understanding, integrating information from multiple modalities can\nprovide a more comprehensive view, enhancing both representation accuracy and\ngeneralization. However, variations in information granularity impede the\nsemantic alignment of road network-based paths (road paths) and image-based\npaths (image paths), while the heterogeneity of multi-modal data poses\nsubstantial challenges for effective fusion and utilization. In this paper, we\npropose a novel Multi-modal, Multi-granularity Path Representation Learning\nFramework (MM-Path), which can learn a generic path representation by\nintegrating modalities from both road paths and image paths. To enhance the\nalignment of multi-modal data, we develop a multi-granularity alignment\nstrategy that systematically associates nodes, road sub-paths, and road paths\nwith their corresponding image patches, ensuring the synchronization of both\ndetailed local information and broader global contexts. To address the\nheterogeneity of multi-modal data effectively, we introduce a graph-based\ncross-modal residual fusion component designed to comprehensively fuse\ninformation across different modalities and granularities. Finally, we conduct\nextensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets under two\ndownstream tasks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed MM-Path.

The theory of turbulent\nclumpy starforming gas disks together with the scaling relations of the\ninterstellar medium describes the large and small-scale properties of galactic\ngas disks.

The model\nreproduces the IR luminosities, CO, HCN, and HCO+ line luminosities, and the CO\nspectral line energy distributions of these galaxies. We derive CO(1-0) and\nHCN(1-0) conversion factors for all galaxy samples. The relation between the\nstar formation rate per unit area and H2 surface density cannot be fit simply\nfor all redshifts. There is a tight correlation between the star formation\nefficiency and the product of the gas turbulent velocity dispersion and the\nangular velocity of the galaxies. Galaxies of lower stellar masses can in\nprinciple compensate their gas consumption via star formation by radial viscous\ngas accretion. The limiting stellar mass increases with redshift. Whereas the\nradio continuum emission is directly proportional to the density of cosmic ray\n(CR) electrons, the molecular line emission depends on the CR ionization rate\nvia the gas chemistry. The normalization of the CR ionization rate found for\nthe different galaxy samples is about a factor of three to five higher than the\nnormalization for the Solar neighborhood. This means that the mean yield of low\nenergy CR particles for a given star formation rate per unit area is about\nthree to ten times higher in external galaxies than observed by Voyager I.",

Given that the entire\nearly universe is fundamentally an open system, we apply the Lanczos algorithm\nto investigate Krylov complexity across different phases of the early universe,\nincluding inflation, the radiation-dominated period (RD), and the\nmatter-dominated period (MD). Notably, we find that Krylov complexity differs\nbetween the closed and open system approaches. To effectively capture the\nimpact of potentials during the RD and MD phases, we analyze various\ninflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, the \\(R^2\\)\ninflationary potential, and chaotic inflationary potential, which is taking\ninto account the violations of slow-roll conditions. This analysis is conducted\nin terms of conformal time through the preheating process. Our numerical\nresults indicate that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy is\nremarkably similar within distinctive potentials in RD and MD. Additionally, we\nrigorously construct what is referred to as an open two-mode squeezed state,\nutilizing the second kind of Meixner polynomials. Based on this construction,\nwe are the first to calculate the evolution equations for \\(r_k\\) and\n\\(\\phi_k\\) as they relate to the scale factor. Our findings suggest that\ndissipative effects lead to a rapid decoherence-like behavior. Moreover, our\nresults indicate that inflation behaves as a strongly dissipative system, while\nboth the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated phases exhibit\ncharacteristics of weak dissipation. This research provides new insights into\nexploring the universe from the perspective of quantum information.",

Specifically, GeneQuery takes\ngene-related texts as queries and whole-slide images as contexts and then\npredicts the queried gene expression values. With such a transformation,\nGeneQuery can implicitly estimate the gene distribution by introducing the gene\nrandom variable. Besides, the proposed GeneQuery consists of two architecture\nimplementations, i.e., spot-aware GeneQuery for capturing patterns between\nimages and gene-aware GeneQuery for capturing patterns between genes.\nComprehensive experiments on spatial transcriptomics datasets show that the\nproposed GeneQuery outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on known and\nunseen genes. More results also demonstrate that GeneQuery can potentially\nanalyze the tissue structure.",

Recent works on FL\nhave advocated taking a Bayesian approach to FL as it offers a principled way\nto account for the model and predictive uncertainty by learning a posterior\ndistribution for the client and/or server models. Moreover, Bayesian FL also\nnaturally enables personalization in FL to handle data heterogeneity across the\ndifferent clients by having each client learn its own distinct personalized\nmodel. In particular, the hierarchical Bayesian approach enables all the\nclients to learn their personalized models while also taking into account the\ncommonalities via a prior distribution provided by the server. However, despite\ntheir promise, Bayesian approaches for FL can be computationally expensive and\ncan have high communication costs as well because of the requirement of\ncomputing and sending the posterior distributions. We present a novel Bayesian\nFL method using an efficient second-order optimization approach, with a\ncomputational cost that is similar to first-order optimization methods like\nAdam, but also provides the various benefits of the Bayesian approach for FL\n(e.g., uncertainty, personalization), while also being significantly more\nefficient and accurate than SOTA Bayesian FL methods (both for standard as well\nas personalized FL settings).

Due to the\nabsence of dedicated leg sensors, currently available body tracking methods\nadopt a synthesis approach to generate plausible motions given a 3-point signal\nfrom the head and controller tracking. In order to enable mixed reality\nfeatures, modern XR devices are capable of estimating depth information of the\nheadset surroundings using available sensors combined with dedicated machine\nlearning models. Such egocentric depth sensing cannot drive the body directly,\nas it is not registered and is incomplete due to limited field-of-view and body\nself-occlusions. For the first time, we propose to leverage the available depth\nsensing signal combined with self-supervision to learn a multi-modal pose\nestimation model capable of tracking full body motions in real time on XR\ndevices. We demonstrate how current 3-point motion synthesis models can be\nextended to point cloud modalities using a semantic point cloud encoder network\ncombined with a residual network for multi-modal pose estimation. These modules\nare trained jointly in a self-supervised way, leveraging a combination of real\nunregistered point clouds and simulated data obtained from motion capture. We\ncompare our approach against several state-of-the-art systems for XR body\ntracking and show that our method accurately tracks a diverse range of body\nmotions.

    "abstract": "We present SNOWS, a one-shot post-training pruning framework aimed at\nreducing the cost of vision network inference without retraining. Current\nleading one-shot pruning methods minimize layer-wise least squares\nreconstruction error which does not take into account deeper network\nrepresentations. We propose to optimize a more global reconstruction objective.\nThis objective accounts for nonlinear activations deep in the network to obtain\na better proxy for the network loss. This nonlinear objective leads to a more\nchallenging optimization problem -- we demonstrate it can be solved efficiently\nusing a specialized second-order optimization framework. A key innovation of\nour framework is the use of Hessian-free optimization to compute exact Newton\ndescent steps without needing to compute or store the full Hessian matrix. A\ndistinct advantage of SNOWS is that it can be readily applied on top of any\nsparse mask derived from prior methods, readjusting their weights to exploit\nnonlinearities in deep feature representations. SNOWS obtains state-of-the-art\nresults on various one-shot pruning benchmarks including residual networks and\nVision Transformers (ViT/B-16 and ViT/L-16, 86m and 304m parameters\nrespectively).",

    "abstract": "The high computational cost and slow inference time are major obstacles to\ndeploying Video Diffusion Models (VDMs). To overcome this, we introduce a new\nVideo Diffusion Model Compression approach using individual content and motion\ndynamics preserved pruning and consistency loss. First, we empirically observe\nthat deeper VDM layers are crucial for maintaining the quality of\n\\textbf{motion dynamics} (\\textit{e.g.,} coherence of the entire video), while\nshallower layers are more focused on \\textbf{individual content}\n(\\textit{e.g.,} individual frames). Therefore, we prune redundant blocks from\nthe shallower layers while preserving more of the deeper layers, resulting in a\nlightweight VDM variant called VDMini. Moreover, we propose an\n\\textbf{Individual Content and Motion Dynamics (ICMD)} Consistency Loss to gain\ncomparable generation performance as larger VDM to VDMini. In particular, we\nfirst use the Individual Content Distillation (ICD) Loss to preserve the\nconsistency in the features of each generated frame between the teacher and\nstudent models. Next, we introduce a Multi-frame Content Adversarial (MCA) Loss\nto enhance the motion dynamics across the generated video as a whole. This\nmethod significantly accelerates inference time while maintaining high-quality\nvideo generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nVDMini on two important video generation tasks, Text-to-Video (T2V) and\nImage-to-Video (I2V), where we respectively achieve an average 2.5 $\\times$,\n1.4 $\\times$, and 1.25 $\\times$ speed up for the I2V method SF-V, the T2V\nmethod T2V-Turbo-v2, and the T2V method HunyuanVideo, while maintaining the\nquality of the generated videos on several benchmarks including UCF101,\nVBench-T2V, and VBench-I2V.",

For this\ncalculation we adopt the spectral methods approach which heavily relies on the\nanalytic properties of the Jost function. This function is extracted from the\ninteraction of the quantum fluctuations with a background potential generated\nby the soliton. Particularly we explore eventual non-analytical components that\nmay be induced by mass gaps and the unconventional normalization for the\nlongitudinal component of the vector field fluctuations. By numerical\nsimulation we verify that these obstacles do actually not arise and that the\nreal and imaginary momentum formulations of the VPE yield equal results. The\nBorn approximation to the Jost function is crucial when implementing standard\nrenormalization conditions. In this context we solve problems arising from the\nBorn approximation being imaginary for real momenta associated with energies in\nthe mass gap.",

    "abstract": "Assessing image quality is crucial in image processing tasks such as\ncompression, super-resolution, and denoising. While subjective assessments\ninvolving human evaluators provide the most accurate quality scores, they are\nimpractical for large-scale or continuous evaluations due to their high cost\nand time requirements. Pairwise comparison subjective assessment tests, which\nrank image pairs instead of assigning scores, offer more reliability and\naccuracy but require numerous comparisons, leading to high costs. Although\nobjective quality metrics are more efficient, they lack the precision of\nsubjective tests, which are essential for benchmarking and training\nlearning-based quality metrics. This paper proposes an uncertainty-based\nsampling method to optimize the pairwise comparison subjective assessment\nprocess. By utilizing deep learning models to estimate human preferences and\nidentify pairs that need human labeling, the approach reduces the number of\nrequired comparisons while maintaining high accuracy.

As we are currently in the\nNISQ (noisy intermediate scale quantum) era, quantum algorithm researchers\ncannot reliably test their algorithms on real quantum hardware, which is still\ntoo limited. Instead, quantum computing simulators on classical computing\nsystems are used. In the quantum circuit model, quantum bits (qubits) are\noperated on by quantum gates. A quantum circuit is a sequence of such quantum\ngates operating on some number of qubits. A quantum gate applied to a qubit can\nbe controlled by other qubits in the circuit. This applies the gate only to the\nstates which satisfy the required control qubit state. We particularly target\nFPGAs as our main simulation platform, as these offer potential energy savings\nwhen compared to running simulations on CPUs/GPUs.\n  In this work, we present a memory access pattern to optimise the number of\niterations that need to be scheduled to execute a quantum gate such that only\nthe iterations which access the required pairs (determined according to the\ncontrol qubits imposed on the gate) are scheduled. We show that this approach\nresults in a significant reduction in the time required to simulate a gate for\neach added control qubit.

Traditional methods primarily focus on identifying reused\nvulnerability code within target software, yet they cannot verify if these\nvulnerabilities can be triggered in new software contexts. This limitation\noften results in false positives. In this paper, we introduce TransferFuzz, a\nnovel vulnerability verification framework, to verify whether vulnerabilities\npropagated through code reuse can be triggered in new software. Innovatively,\nwe collected runtime information during the execution or fuzzing of the basic\nbinary (the vulnerable binary detailed in CVE reports). This process allowed us\nto extract historical traces, which proved instrumental in guiding the fuzzing\nprocess for the target binary (the new binary that reused the vulnerable\nfunction). TransferFuzz introduces a unique Key Bytes Guided Mutation strategy\nand a Nested Simulated Annealing algorithm, which transfers these historical\ntraces to implement trace-guided fuzzing on the target binary, facilitating the\naccurate and efficient verification of the propagated vulnerability. Our\nevaluation, conducted on widely recognized datasets, shows that TransferFuzz\ncan quickly validate vulnerabilities previously unverifiable with existing\ntechniques. Its verification speed is 2.5 to 26.2 times faster than existing\nmethods. Moreover, TransferFuzz has proven its effectiveness by expanding the\nimpacted software scope for 15 vulnerabilities listed in CVE reports,\nincreasing the number of affected binaries from 15 to 53.

Modern FPGAs support dual-output\nLUT, which can significantly reduce the area of FPGA designs. Several existing\nworks explored the use of dual-output in approximate computing. However, they\nare limited to small-scale arithmetic circuits. To address the problem, this\nwork proposes QUADOL, a quality-driven ALS method by exploiting dual-output\nLUTs for modern FPGAs. We propose a technique to approximately merge two\nsingle-output LUTs (i.e., a LUT pair) into a dual-output LUT. In addition, we\ntransform the problem of selecting multiple LUT pairs for simultaneous\napproximate merging into a maximum matching problem to maximize the area\nreduction. Since QUADOL exploits a new dimension, i.e., approximately merging a\nLUT pair into a dual-output LUT, it can be integrated with any existing ALS\nmethods to strengthen them. Therefore, we also introduce QUADOL+, which is a\ngeneric framework to integrate QUADOL into existing ALS methods. The\nexperimental results showed that QUADOL+ can reduce the LUT count by up to 18%\ncompared to the state-of-the-art ALS methods for FPGA.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a resource allocation and model retraining\nproblem for dynamic wireless networks by utilizing incremental learning, in\nwhich the digital twin (DT) scheme is employed for decision making. A\ntwo-timescale framework is proposed for computation resource allocation, mobile\nuser association, and incremental training of user models. To obtain an optimal\nresource allocation and incremental learning policy, we propose an efficient\ntwo-timescale scheme based on hybrid DT-physical architecture with the\nobjective to minimize long-term system delay. Specifically, in the\nlarge-timescale, base stations will update the user association and implement\nincremental learning decisions based on statistical state information from the\nDT system. Then, in the short timescale, an effective computation resource\nallocation and incremental learning data generated from the DT system is\ndesigned based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), thus reducing the network\nsystem's delay in data transmission, data computation, and model retraining\nsteps. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\ntwo-timescale scheme compared with benchmark schemes.",

    "abstract": "Event-based Action Recognition (EAR) possesses the advantages of\nhigh-temporal resolution capturing and privacy preservation compared with\ntraditional action recognition. Current leading EAR solutions typically follow\ntwo regimes: project unconstructed event streams into dense constructed event\nframes and adopt powerful frame-specific networks, or employ lightweight\npoint-specific networks to handle sparse unconstructed event points directly.\nHowever, such two regimes are blind to a fundamental issue: failing to\naccommodate the unique dense temporal and sparse spatial properties of\nasynchronous event data. In this article, we present a synergy-aware framework,\ni.e., EventCrab, that adeptly integrates the \"lighter\" frame-specific networks\nfor dense event frames with the \"heavier\" point-specific networks for sparse\nevent points, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we establish a\njoint frame-text-point representation space to bridge distinct event frames and\npoints. In specific, to better exploit the unique spatiotemporal relationships\ninherent in asynchronous event points, we devise two strategies for the\n\"heavier\" point-specific embedding: i) a Spiking-like Context Learner (SCL)\nthat extracts contextualized event points from raw event streams. ii) an Event\nPoint Encoder (EPE) that further explores event-point long spatiotemporal\nfeatures in a Hilbert-scan way. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the\nsignificant performance of our proposed EventCrab, particularly gaining\nimprovements of 5.17% on SeAct and 7.01% on HARDVS.",

Despite\nthe wealth of data, one of the critical issues in flavor physics, namely CP\nviolation in baryon decays, still awaits experimental confirmation. It is\nevident that the development of formulas and phenomenological analyses will\nplay a pivotal role in advancing theoretical investigations and experimental\nmeasurements in this domain. In this work, we discuss the fundamental\ndefinitions and properties of polarization, asymmetry parameters and their\nassociated CP violating observables that may arise in baryon decays.\nAdditionally, we provide a detailed analysis of b-baryon quasi-two and -three\nbody decays based on angular distributions. We highlight the significance of CP\nasymmetries defined by spin and momentum correlations, as non-trivial spin\ndistributions are expected in baryon decays due to their non-zero polarization\nin productions and decays. Of particular importance is a complementary relation\ncan be establised for two different types of observables, that are\n$\\mathcal{T}$-even and -odd CP asymmetries respectively. The complementarity\nindicates that one observable exhibits the sine dependence on strong phase\n$\\Delta\\delta$, while another exhibits as cosine. This gives us an distinctive\nopportunity to avoid the potential large suppression to CP asymmetries from\nsmall phase $\\Delta\\delta$. Two points (\\textbf{i}) the exact proof of strong\nphase dependence behaviour, and (\\textbf{ii}) the criterion for complementary\nobservables are clarified. Based on these arguments from theoretical aside,\nsome brief discussions and suggestions on experimental measurements are offered\nin the final discussions. Lastly, we present a pedagogical introduction to\nangular distribution techniques based on helicity descriptions for both two and\nthree body decays.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents theoretical and experimental studies on the\nsuperconductivity of Pb${_{0.64}}$Bi$_{0.36}$ alloy, which is a prototype of\nstrongly coupled superconductors and exhibits one of the strongest coupling\nunder ambient pressure among the materials studied so far. The critical\ntemperature, the specific heat in the superconducting state, and the magnetic\ncritical fields are experimentally determined. Deviations from the single-gap\ns-wave BCS-like behavior are observed. The electronic structure, phonons and\nelectron-phonon interactions are analyzed in relation to the metallic Pb,\nexplaining why the Pb-Bi alloy exhibits such a large value of the\nelectron-phonon coupling parameter $\\lambda \\simeq 2$. Superconductivity is\nstudied using the isotropic Eliashberg formalism as well as the anisotropic\ndensity functional theory for superconductors. We find that while Pb is a\ntwo-gap superconductor with well-defined separate superconducting gaps, in the\nPb-Bi alloy an overlapped three-gap-like structure is formed with a strong\nanisotropy. Furthermore, the chemical disorder, inherent to this alloy, leads\nto strong electron scattering, which is found to reduce the critical\ntemperature.",

A recent\nresult shows that 2FRP in directed graphs can be solved in $\\tilde{O}(n^3)$\ntime [arXiv:2209.07016]. In this paper, we show a 3FRP algorithm in\ndeterministic $\\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time for undirected weighted graphs, which\nalmost matches the size of the output. This implies that $f$FRP in undirected\ngraphs can be solved in almost optimal $\\tilde{O}(n^f)$ time for all $f\\geq 3$.\nTo construct our 3FRP algorithm, we introduce an incremental distance\nsensitivity oracle (DSO) with $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$ worst-case update time, while\npreprocessing time, space, and query time are still $\\tilde{O}(n^3)$,\n$\\tilde{O}(n^2)$ and $\\tilde{O}(1)$, respectively, which match the static DSO\n[Bernstein and Karger 2009]. Here in a DSO, we can preprocess a graph so that\nthe distance between any pair of vertices given any failed edge can be answered\nefficiently. From the recent result in [arXiv:2211.05178], we can obtain an\noffline dynamic DSO from the incremental worst-case DSO, which makes the\nconstruction of our 3FRP algorithm more convenient. By the offline dynamic DSO,\nwe can also construct a 2-fault single-source replacement path (2-fault SSRP)\nalgorithm in $\\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time, that is, from a given vertex $s$, we want\nto find the distance to any vertex $t$ when any pair of edges fail. Thus the\n$\\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time complexity for 2-fault SSRP is also almost optimal. Now\nwe know that in undirected graphs 1FRP can be solved in $\\tilde{O}(m)$ time\n[Nardelli, Proietti, Widmayer 2001], and 2FRP and 3FRP in undirected graphs can\nbe solved in $\\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time. In this paper, we also show that a truly\nsubcubic algorithm for 2FRP in undirected graphs does not exist under\nAPSP-hardness conjecture.",

A scenario that is commonly encountered in the experimental practice\narises when the bosonic mode interacts with an external dissipative thermal\nbath, making the qubit-boson system open. In this work, we present new\nanalytical solution of the Lindblad master equations for the open dispersive\nJaynes-Cummings model and a perturbative analytical solution of the open\nquantum Rabi model in the limit of weak qubit-boson coupling $g$, using the\nholomorphic formalism in Bargmann space.

Additionally, we\nobtain a perturbative analytical solution for the open quantum Rabi model up to\nsecond order in $g$.

Furthermore, instead\nof traditional MLPs, we employ Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as the\nfundamental building blocks of both modules, which exhibit superior parameter\nefficiency and reduced spectral bias to better capture high-frequency\ncomponents critical for CT interpretation while mitigating overfitting.\nExtensive experiments on the public CTRG-Chest-548 K dataset demonstrate that\nour method outpaces prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across almost all\nmetrics.

The measurements\nare carried out at a carrier frequency of 5.6 GHz with a bandwidth of 400 MHz,\nemploying distributed antenna arrays with a total of 128 elements. Multiple\nscalar metrics are selected to evaluate spatial separability in line-of-sight,\nnon line-of-sight, and mixed conditions. Firstly, through studying the singular\nvalue spread, it is shown that in line-of-sight conditions, better user\northogonality is achieved with a distributed MIMO setup compared to a\nco-located MIMO array. Furthermore, the dirty-paper coding (DPC) capacity and\nzero forcing (ZF) precoding sum-rate capacities are investigated across varying\nnumbers of antennas and their topologies. The results show that in all three\nconditions, the less complex ZF precoder can be applied in distributed massive\nMIMO systems while still achieving a large fraction of the DPC capacity.\nAdditionally, in line-of-sight conditions, both sum-rate capacities and user\nfairness benefit from more antennas and a more distributed antenna topology.\nHowever, in the given NLoS condition, the improvement in spatial separability\nthrough distributed antenna topologies is limited.",

However, we discover that it still suffers\nfrom subject neglect or mixing when the input text prompt contains multiple\nsubjects of similar semantics or appearance. We identify three possible\nambiguities within the MMDiT architecture that cause this problem: Inter-block\nAmbiguity, Text Encoder Ambiguity, and Semantic Ambiguity. To address these\nissues, we propose to repair the ambiguous latent on-the-fly by test-time\noptimization at early denoising steps. In detail, we design three loss\nfunctions: Block Alignment Loss, Text Encoder Alignment Loss, and Overlap Loss,\neach tailored to mitigate these ambiguities. Despite significant improvements,\nwe observe that semantic ambiguity persists when generating multiple similar\nsubjects, as the guidance provided by overlap loss is not explicit enough.\nTherefore, we further propose Overlap Online Detection and Back-to-Start\nSampling Strategy to alleviate the problem. Experimental results on a newly\nconstructed challenging dataset of similar subjects validate the effectiveness\nof our approach, showing superior generation quality and much higher success\nrates over existing methods.

Worse still, despite the\nrapid emergence of high-performing single-modality detection models, there is\nstill a lack of specialized training techniques that can effectively adapt\nthese models for multispectral detection tasks. The absence of a standardized\nbenchmark with fair and consistent experimental setups also poses a significant\nbarrier to evaluating the effectiveness of new approaches. To this end, we\npropose the first fair and reproducible benchmark specifically designed to\nevaluate the training \"techniques\", which systematically classifies existing\nmultispectral object detection methods, investigates their sensitivity to\nhyper-parameters, and standardizes the core configurations. A comprehensive\nevaluation is conducted across multiple representative multispectral object\ndetection datasets, utilizing various backbone networks and detection\nframeworks. Additionally, we introduce an efficient and easily deployable\nmultispectral object detection framework that can seamlessly optimize\nhigh-performing single-modality models into dual-modality models, integrating\nour advanced training techniques.",

A simplified laboratory-scale geometry of the\ngap separating the outlet of these chambers, just upstream of the turbine inlet\nin can-annular combustor architectures, is considered. It consists of two\nchannels with anechoic and chocked conditions on the upstream and downstream\nsides respectively. Right before the choked-flow vanes which represent the\nturbine inlet, a small aperture leads to an aeroacoustic crosstalk between the\nchannels. The dimensions and flow conditions are defined such that relevant\nMach, Strouhal and Helmholtz numbers of gas turbines are reproduced. The\nalignment of the vanes with respect to the crosstalk aperture is varied. An\nintense whistling is observed for some conditions. The oscillation frequency\ndepends on the aperture area and scales with the Strouhal number based on the\naperture length. The upstream anechoic condition in each channel implies that\nno longitudinal acoustic mode participate to the mechanism of this whistling,\nwhich is in agreement with the Strouhal scaling of this intrinsic aeroacoustic\ninstability. Compressible Large Eddy Simulations of the configuration have been\nperformed and remarkably reproduce the whistling phenomenon. This work\ncontributes to the understanding of aeroacoustic instabilities at the crosstalk\napertures of can-annular combustors. It will help designing combustor-turbine\ninterfaces to suppress them, which is important since the vibrations they\ninduce may be as damaging as the ones from thermoacoustic instabilities.",

However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor\nattacks, where models behave normally for standard queries but generate harmful\nresponses or unintended output when specific triggers are activated. Existing\nbackdoor defenses often suffer from drawbacks that they either focus on\ndetection without removal, rely on rigid assumptions about trigger properties,\nor prove to be ineffective against advanced attacks like multi-trigger\nbackdoors. In this paper, we present a novel method to eliminate backdoor\nbehaviors from LLMs through the construction of information conflicts using\nboth internal and external mechanisms. Internally, we leverage a lightweight\ndataset to train a conflict model, which is then merged with the backdoored\nmodel to neutralize malicious behaviors by embedding contradictory information\nwithin the model's parametric memory. Externally, we incorporate convincing\ncontradictory evidence into the prompt to challenge the model's internal\nbackdoor knowledge. Experimental results on classification and conversational\ntasks across 4 widely used LLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms 8\nstate-of-the-art backdoor defense baselines. We can reduce the attack success\nrate of advanced backdoor attacks by up to 98% while maintaining over 90% clean\ndata accuracy. Furthermore, our method has proven to be robust against adaptive\nbackdoor attacks. The code will be open-sourced upon publication.",

Herein, a novel neoHebbian artificial synapse utilizing ReRAM\ndevices has been proposed and experimentally validated to meet this demand.\nThis synapse features two distinct state variables: a neuron coupling weight\nand an \"eligibility trace\" that dictates synaptic weight updates. The coupling\nweight is encoded in the ReRAM conductance, while the \"eligibility trace\" is\nencoded in the local temperature of the ReRAM and is modulated by applying\nvoltage pulses to a physically co-located resistive heating element. The\nutility of the proposed synapse has been investigated using two representative\ntasks: first, temporal signal classification using Recurrent Spiking Neural\nNetworks (RSNNs) employing the e-prop algorithm, and second, Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) for path planning tasks in feedforward networks using a modified\nversion of the same learning rule. System-level simulations, accounting for\nvarious device and system-level non-idealities, confirm that these synapses\noffer a robust solution for the fast, compact, and energy-efficient\nimplementation of advanced learning rules in neuromorphic hardware.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a paradigm for conducting machine learning\nacross broad and decentralized datasets, promising enhanced privacy by\nobviating the need for direct data sharing. However, recent studies show that\nattackers can steal private data through model manipulation or gradient\nanalysis. Existing attacks are constrained by low theft quantity or\nlow-resolution data, and they are often detected through anomaly monitoring in\ngradients or weights. In this paper, we propose a novel data-reconstruction\nattack leveraging malicious code injection, supported by two key techniques,\ni.e., distinctive and sparse encoding design and block partitioning. Unlike\nconventional methods that require detectable changes to the model, our method\nstealthily embeds a hidden model using parameter sharing to systematically\nextract sensitive data. The Fibonacci-based index design ensures efficient,\nstructured retrieval of memorized data, while the block partitioning method\nenhances our method's capability to handle high-resolution images by dividing\nthem into smaller, manageable units. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets\nconfirmed that our method is superior to the five state-of-the-art\ndata-reconstruction attacks under the five respective detection methods. Our\nmethod can handle large-scale and high-resolution data without being detected\nor mitigated by state-of-the-art data reconstruction defense methods. In\ncontrast to baselines, our method can be directly applied to both FedAVG and\nFedSGD scenarios, underscoring the need for developers to devise new defenses\nagainst such vulnerabilities.

The formation of MADs are usually attributed to the accumulation\nof a sufficient amount of dynamically significant poloidal magnetic flux. In\nthis work, the magnetic flux transport within an advection dominated accretion\nflow and the formation of a MAD are investigated. The structure and dynamics of\nan inner MAD connected with an outer ADAF are derived by solving a set of\ndifferential equations with suitable boundary conditions. We find that an inner\nMAD disk is eventually formed at a region about several ten Schwarzschild\nradius outside the horizon. Due to the presence of strong large-scale magnetic\nfield, the radial velocity of the accretion flow is significantly decreased.\nThe angular velocity of the MAD region is highly subkeplerian with $\\Omega \\sim\n(0.4-0.5)\\Omega_{\\rm K}$ and the corresponding ratio of gas to magnetic\npressure is about $\\beta \\lesssim 1$. Also, we find that MAD is unlikely to be\nformed through the inward flux advection process when the external magnetic\nfield strength weak enough with $\\beta_{\\rm out}\\gtrsim 100$ around $R_{\\rm\nout}\\sim 1000R_{\\rm s}$. Based on the rough estimate, we find that the jet\npower of a black hole, with mass $M_{\\rm BH}$ and spin $a_*$, surrounded by an\nADAF with inner MAD region is about two order of magnitude larger than that of\na black hole surrounded by a normal ADAF. This may account for the powerful\njets observed in some Fanaroff Riley type I galaxies with a very low Eddington\nratio.",

Our construction is motivated by the observed similarities in the\nthermodynamic behavior of flat black holes within the R\\'enyi entropy framework\nand that of AdS black holes described by the Bekenstein entropy regime. The\nRPST framework is, by construction, exclusive to AdS black holes because it\ndepends on the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$, which is linked to the central\ncharge $C$ of the dual conformal field theory (CFT). However, for non-AdS black\nholes, where $\\Lambda$ is absent, we introduce a deformation parameter\n$\\lambda$ to replace the central charge $C$. This RPST-inspired formalism\nincorporates $\\lambda$ and its conjugate variable, the response potential\n$\\zeta$, as a new pair of thermodynamic variables, analogous to the central\ncharge $C$ and chemical potential $\\mu$ in the AdS case. To illustrate the\napplicability of this formalism, we analyze two examples: the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om (RN) flat black hole and the Kerr black hole.",

We propose a novel, general-purpose partitioning algorithm that\nutilizes competition between models to detect and separate these functional\npatterns. This competition is induced by multiple models iteratively submitting\ntheir predictions for the dataset, with the best prediction for each data point\nbeing rewarded with training on that data point. This reward mechanism\namplifies each model's strengths and encourages specialization in different\npatterns. The specializations can then be translated into a partitioning\nscheme. The amplification of each model's strengths inverts the active learning\nparadigm: while active learning typically focuses the training of models on\ntheir weaknesses to minimize the number of required training data points, our\nconcept reinforces the strengths of each model, thus specializing them. We\nvalidate our concept -- called active partitioning -- with various datasets\nwith clearly distinct functional patterns, such as mechanical stress and strain\ndata in a porous structure. The active partitioning algorithm produces valuable\ninsights into the datasets' structure, which can serve various further\napplications. As a demonstration of one exemplary usage, we set up modular\nmodels consisting of multiple expert models, each learning a single partition,\nand compare their performance on more than twenty popular regression problems\nwith single models learning all partitions simultaneously.

Methods: In this study,\nwe developed a novel artificial neural network architecture, multimodal\ntransformer-based simple temporal attention (MMTSimTA) network, building upon a\ncombination of recent successful developments. We integrated pre- and\non-treatment blood measurements, prescribed medications and CT-based volumes of\norgans from a large pan-cancer cohort of 694 patients treated with\nimmunotherapy to predict mortality at three, six, nine and twelve months.\nDifferent variants of our extended MMTSimTA network were implemented and\ncompared to baseline methods incorporating intermediate and late fusion based\nintegration methods. Results: The strongest prognostic performance was\ndemonstrated using a variant of the MMTSimTA model with area under the curves\n(AUCs) of $0.84 \\pm $0.04, $0.83 \\pm $0.02, $0.82 \\pm $0.02, $0.81 \\pm $0.03\nfor 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month survival prediction, respectively.

Unlike the\nwell-investigated detection probability (often termed as the success or\ncoverage probability in stochastic geometry), the tracking probability\ncharacterizes the event of successive successful target detection with a\nsequence of radar pulses. From a theoretical standpoint, this work adds to the\nrich repertoire of statistical metrics in stochastic geometry-based wireless\nnetwork analysis. To optimize the target tracking probability in high\ninterference scenarios, we study a block medium access control (MAC) protocol\nfor the automotive radars to share a common channel and recommend the optimal\nMAC parameter for a given vehicle and street density. Importantly, we show that\nthe optimal MAC parameter that maximizes the detection probability may not be\nthe one that maximizes the tracking probability. Our research reveals how the\ntracking event can be naturally mapped to the quality of service (QoS)\nrequirements of latency and reliability for different vehicular technology\nuse-cases.

    "abstract": "Dynamic MRI enables a range of clinical applications, including cardiac\nfunction assessment, organ motion tracking, and radiotherapy guidance. However,\nfully sampling the dynamic k-space data is often infeasible due to time\nconstraints and physiological motion such as respiratory and cardiac motion.\nThis necessitates undersampling, which degrades the quality of reconstructed\nimages. Poor image quality not only hinders visualization but also impairs the\nestimation of deformation fields, crucial for registering dynamic (moving)\nimages to a static reference image. This registration enables tasks such as\nmotion correction, treatment planning, and quantitative analysis in\napplications like cardiac imaging and MR-guided radiotherapy. To overcome the\nchallenges posed by undersampling and motion, we introduce an end-to-end deep\nlearning (DL) framework that integrates adaptive dynamic k-space sampling,\nreconstruction, and registration. Our approach begins with a DL-based adaptive\nsampling strategy, optimizing dynamic k-space acquisition to capture the most\nrelevant data for each specific case. This is followed by a DL-based\nreconstruction module that produces images optimized for accurate deformation\nfield estimation from the undersampled moving data. Finally, a registration\nmodule estimates the deformation fields aligning the reconstructed dynamic\nimages with a static reference. The proposed framework is independent of\nspecific reconstruction and registration modules allowing for plug-and-play\nintegration of these components. The entire framework is jointly trained using\na combination of supervised and unsupervised loss functions, enabling\nend-to-end optimization for improved performance across all components. Through\ncontrolled experiments and ablation studies, we validate each component,\ndemonstrating that each choice contributes to robust motion estimation from\nundersampled dynamic data.",

This can be achieved by prompt gamma detection with a Compton camera\nlike the SiFi-CC. This study aims to show the feasibility of optimising the\ngeometry of SiFi-CC Compton camera for verification of dose distribution via\nprompt gamma detection using a genetic algorithm (GA). Approach: The SiFi-CC\nkey geometric parameters for optimisation with the GA are the\nsource-to-scatterer and scatterer-to-absorber distances, and the module\nthicknesses. The optimisation process was conducted with a software framework\nbased on the Geant4 toolkit, which included detailed and realistic modelling of\ngamma interactions, detector response, and further steps such as event\nselection and image reconstruction. The performance of each individual\nconfiguration was evaluated using a fitness function incorporating factors\nrelated to gamma detection efficiency and image resolution. Results: The\nGA-optimised SiFi-CC configuration demonstrated the capability to detect a 5 mm\nproton beam range shift with a 2 mm resolution using 5e8 protons. The\nbest-performing geometry, with 16 fibre layers in the scatterer, 36 layers in\nthe absorber, source-to-scatterer distance 150 mm and scatterer-to-absorber\ndistance 120 mm, has an imaging sensitivity of 5.58(1)e-5.

It requires only fundamental calculus and a\nbasic understanding of measure theory.\n  In Chapter 1, we introduce the primary object of study, the fractional\nLaplacian. This operator appears in diverse contexts, prompting multiple\ndefinitions and viewpoints, many of which we explore, along with some key\nidentities.\n  A notable distinction between local and nonlocal analysis is that in the\nlatter, explicit calculations are often impractical or impossible. There are\nanyway some fortunate exceptions which are gathered in Chapter 2, providing\nuseful and instructive examples.\n  Chapter 3 presents an introduction to the important aspect of Liouville-type\nresults.\n  A large portion of this book is devoted to the regularity theory of solutions\nin Lebesgue spaces. Chapter 4 examines global solutions using Riesz and Bessel\npotential analysis, capturing the impact of both low and high frequencies on\nsmoothness, decay, and oscillations. These spaces are also flexible enough to\nprovide, as a byproduct, a solid regularity theory in the more commonly used\nfractional Sobolev spaces.\n  In Chapter 5 we derive the corresponding interior regularity theory for\nsolutions within a bounded domain using appropriate cutoffs and localization\ntechniques.\n  Additionally, technical appendices include auxiliary results used in key\nproofs.",

Since the mechanism of energy release from solar flares is still not\nfully understood, the study of fine-scale features developing during flares\nbecomes important for progressing towards a consistent picture of the essential\nphysical mechanisms. Aims. We aim to probe the fine structures in flare ribbons\nat the chromospheric level using high-resolution observations with imaging and\nspectral techniques. Methods. We present a GOES C2.4 class solar flare observed\nwith the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST), the Interface Region Imaging\nSpectrograph (IRIS), and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). The\nhigh-resolution SST observations offer spectroscopic data in the H-alpha, Ca II\n8542 {\\AA}, and H-beta lines, which we use to analyse the flare ribbon.\nResults. Within the eastern flare ribbon, chromospheric bright blobs were\ndetected and analysed in Ca II 8542 {\\AA}, H-alpha, and H-beta wavelengths. A\ncomparison of blobs in H-beta observations and Si IV 1400 {\\AA} has also been\nperformed. These blobs are observed as almost circular structures having widths\nfrom 140 km-200 km. The intensity profiles of the blobs show a red wing\nasymmetry. Conclusions. From the high spatial and temporal resolution H-beta\nobservations, we conclude that the periodicity of the blobs in the flare\nribbon, which are near-equally spaced in the range 330-550 km, is likely due to\nfragmented reconnection processes within a flare current sheet. This supports\nthe theory of a direct link between fine-structure flare ribbons and current\nsheet tearing.

    "abstract": "Lead halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention as potential\ngas sensing elements due to their unique ability to detect and respond to an\nexternal stimulus with measurable electrical or optical signals. The\ndistinctive characteristics of these materials lie in their ability to operate\nupon gas exposure at room temperature. However, the presence of lead (Pb) poses\na serious challenge for their widespread application and commercialization,\nowing to its toxicity. To address this issue, lead-free Cs2AgBiBr6 double\nperovskite is explored as a promising alternative sensing element for room\ntemperature gas detection. This sensor can be regarded as eco-friendly for the\nfollowing reasons: it does not contain Pb; it is synthesized at room\ntemperature without using strong organic solvents; and it operates and recovers\nat room temperature without heating or UV irradiation and with a very low input\nvoltage (0.1V), thus reducing overall energy consumption. The influence of the\nperovskite morphology on the ozone (O3) sensing performance is investigated, as\nwell as the sensing stability under varying conditions of time, humidity, and\ntemperature. Notably, the sensors' exceptional selectivity for O3 over other\ngases and the interaction between the gases and the perovskite surface is\nconfirmed through experimental and first-principles calculations.",

Meanwhile, in-gap features are observed at the edges\nof CrBr3 island, which display either a zero-energy conductance peak or a pair\nof particle-hole symmetric bound states. They are discretely distributed at the\nedges of CrBr3 film, and their appearance is found closely related to the\natomic lattice reconstruction near the edges. By increasing tunneling\ntransmissivity, the zero-energy conductance peak quickly splits, while the pair\nof nonzero in-gap bound states first approach each other, merge, and then split\nagain.

    "abstract": "Efficient audio quality assessment is vital for streamlining audio codec\ndevelopment. Objective assessment tools have been developed over time to\nalgorithmically predict quality ratings from subjective assessments, the gold\nstandard for quality judgment. Many of these tools use perceptual auditory\nmodels to extract audio features that are mapped to a basic audio quality score\nprediction using machine learning algorithms and subjective scores as training\ndata. However, existing tools struggle with generalization in quality\nprediction, especially when faced with unknown signal and distortion types.\nThis is particularly evident in the presence of signals coded using\nnon-waveform-preserving parametric techniques. Addressing these challenges,\nthis two-part work proposes extensions to the Perceptual Evaluation of Audio\nQuality (PEAQ - ITU-R BS.1387-1) recommendation. Part 1 focuses on increasing\ngeneralization, while Part 2 targets accurate spatial audio quality measurement\nin audio coding.\n  To enhance prediction generalization, this paper (Part 1) introduces a novel\nmachine learning approach that uses subjective data to model cognitive aspects\nof audio quality perception. The proposed method models the perceived severity\nof audible distortions by adaptively weighting different distortion metrics.\nThe weights are determined using an interaction cost function that captures\nrelationships between distortion salience and cognitive effects. Compared to\nother machine learning methods and established tools, the proposed architecture\nachieves higher prediction accuracy on large databases of previously unseen\nsubjective quality scores. The perceptually-motivated model offers a more\nmanageable alternative to general-purpose machine learning algorithms, allowing\npotential extensions and improvements to multi-dimensional quality measurement\nwithout complete retraining.",

However, training MTLLMs is complex and exhaustive,\nparticularly when tasks are subject to change. Recently, the concept of model\nfusion via task vectors has emerged as an efficient approach for combining\nfine-tuning parameters to produce an MTLLM. In this paper, the problem of\nenabling edge users to collaboratively craft such MTLMs via tasks vectors is\nstudied, under the assumption of worst-case adversarial attacks. To this end,\nfirst the influence of adversarial noise to multi-task model fusion is\ninvestigated and a relationship between the so-called weight disentanglement\nerror and the mean squared error (MSE) is derived. Using hypothesis testing, it\nis directly shown that the MSE increases interference between task vectors,\nthereby rendering model fusion ineffective. Then, a novel resilient MTLLM\nfusion (R-MTLLMF) is proposed, which leverages insights about the LLM\narchitecture and fine-tuning process to safeguard task vector aggregation under\nadversarial noise by realigning the MTLLM. The proposed R-MTLLMF is then\ncompared for both worst-case and ideal transmission scenarios to study the\nimpact of the wireless channel. Extensive model fusion experiments with vision\nLLMs demonstrate R-MTLLMF's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline\nperformance across eight different tasks in ideal noise scenarios and\nsignificantly outperforming unprotected model fusion in worst-case scenarios.\nThe results further advocate for additional physical layer protection for a\nholistic approach to resilience, from both a wireless and LLM perspective.",

In this work we present a simple way to derive efficient radial\nupdates meeting the necessary requirements for any potential $V$. We reduce the\nproblem to finding a substitution for the radial direction $||x||=f(z)$ so that\nthe effective potential $V(f(z))$ grows exponentially with\n$z\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty$. Any additive update of $z$ then leads to the desired\nconvergence.

We further generalise the previous results on radial updates to a\nwide class of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms beyond the HMC and we\nquantify the convergence behaviour of MCMC algorithms with badly chosen radial\nupdate.

    "abstract": "Path planning under wireless performance constraints is a complex challenge\nin robot navigation. However, naively incorporating such constraints into\nclassical planning algorithms often incurs prohibitive search costs. In this\npaper, we propose SCoTT, a wireless-aware path planning framework that\nleverages vision-language models (VLMs) to co-optimize average path gains and\ntrajectory length using wireless heatmap images and ray-tracing data from a\ndigital twin (DT). At the core of our framework is Strategic Chain-of-Thought\nTasking (SCoTT), a novel prompting paradigm that decomposes the exhaustive\nsearch problem into structured subtasks, each solved via chain-of-thought\nprompting. To establish strong baselines, we compare classical A* and\nwireless-aware extensions of it, and derive DP-WA*, an optimal, iterative\ndynamic programming algorithm that incorporates all path gains and distance\nmetrics from the DT, but at significant computational cost. In extensive\nexperiments, we show that SCoTT achieves path gains within 2% of DP-WA* while\nconsistently generating shorter trajectories. Moreover, SCoTT's intermediate\noutputs can be used to accelerate DP-WA* by reducing its search space, saving\nup to 62% in execution time. We validate our framework using four VLMs,\ndemonstrating effectiveness across both large and small models, thus making it\napplicable to a wide range of compact models at low inference cost. We also\nshow the practical viability of our approach by deploying SCoTT as a ROS node\nwithin Gazebo simulations. Finally, we discuss data acquisition pipelines,\ncompute requirements, and deployment considerations for VLMs in 6G-enabled DTs,\nunderscoring the potential of natural language interfaces for wireless-aware\nnavigation in real-world applications.",

Recent works on open vocabulary object detection (OVD) enable the\ndetection of objects defined by an in-principle unbounded vocabulary, which\nreduces the cost of training models for specific tasks. However, OVD heavily\nrelies on accurate prompts provided by an ``oracle'', which limits their use in\ncritical applications such as driving scene perception. OVD models tend to\nmisclassify near-out-of-distribution (NOOD) objects that have similar features\nto known classes, and ignore far-out-of-distribution (FOOD) objects. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a framework that enables OVD models to operate in\nopen world settings, by identifying and incrementally learning previously\nunseen objects. To detect FOOD objects, we propose Open World Embedding\nLearning (OWEL) and introduce the concept of Pseudo Unknown Embedding which\ninfers the location of unknown classes in a continuous semantic space based on\nthe information of known classes. We also propose Multi-Scale Contrastive\nAnchor Learning (MSCAL), which enables the identification of misclassified\nunknown objects by promoting the intra-class consistency of object embeddings\nat different scales.

At the distance of Virgo, current radio instruments have the\nresolution to probe scales of ~500 pc and the sensitivity to study dwarf\ngalaxies, the most fragile systems given their shallow gravitational potential\nwells, making Virgo a unique laboratory to study galaxy evolution and AGN\nfeedback in a rich environment.

To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V,\na novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning\ncapability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic\nprocess by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which\ngenerates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic,\nwhich provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach,\nthe Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can\nevolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This\ninteraction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning\nframework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar\nrewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on\ncomplex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by\nRule-based Reward~(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results\nshow that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods,\nincluding GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning\naccuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner\nand constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more\nreliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process.

We study seven bright\n($L_{AGN}(14-150\\mathrm{keV}) \\geq 10^{42}\\mathrm{erg/s}$), nearby (<28 Mpc)\ngalaxies from the GATOS core sample. For comparison, we searched the literature\nfor previous BH mass estimates and made additional calculations using the \\mbh~\n- $\\sigma$ relation and the fundamental plane of BH activity. We developed a\nsupervised machine learning method to estimate BH masses from position-velocity\ndiagrams or first-moment maps using ALMA CO(3-2) observations. Numerical\nsimulations with a wide range of parameters created the training, validation,\nand test sets. Seven galaxies provided enough gas for BH mass estimations:\nNGC4388, NGC5506, NGC5643, NGC6300, NGC7314, NGC7465, and NGC~7582. Our BH\nmasses, ranging from 6.39 to 7.18 log$(M_{BH}/M_\\odot)$, align with previous\nestimates. Additionally, our machine learning method provides robust error\nestimations with confidence intervals and offers greater potential than scaling\nrelations. This work is a first step toward an automated \\mbh estimation method\nusing machine learning.",

An alternative approach is to\ngenerate animatable avatars pre-bound to a rigged template mesh. However, this\nmethod often lacks flexibility and is typically limited to realistic human\nshapes.

Additionally, we employ a coarse-to-fine representation and a\nstructure-aware modeling strategy to ensure both accuracy and robustness, even\nfor characters with non-standard skeleton structures.

    "abstract": "The p-type point-contact germanium (pPCGe) detectors have been widely adopted\nin searches for low energy physics events such as neutrinos and dark matter.\nThis is due to their enhanced capabilities of background rejection, sensitivity\nat energies as low as the sub-keV range and particularly fine energy\nresolution. Nonetheless, the pPCGe is subject to irregular behaviour caused by\nsurface effects for events near the passivated surface. These surface events\ncan, in general, be distinguished from events that occur in the germanium\ncrystal bulk by its slower pulse rise time. Unfortunately, the rise-time\nspectra of bulk and surface events starts to convolve with each other at\nsub-keV energies. In this work, we propose a novel method based on\ncross-correlation shape-matching combined with a low-pass filter to constrain\nthe initial parameter estimates of the signal pulse. This improvement at the\nlowest level leads to a 50% reduction in computation time and refinements in\nthe rise-time resolution, which will, in the end, enhance the overall analysis.\nTo evaluate the performance of the method, we simulate artificial pulses that\nresembles bulk and surface pulses by using a programmable pulse generator\nmodule (pulser). The pulser-generated pulses are then used to examine the pulse\nbehaviours at near-threshold energies, suggesting a roughly 70%\nbackground-leakage reduction in the bulk spectrum. Finally, the method is\ntested on data collected from the TEXONO experiment, where the results are\nconsistent with our observations in pulser and demonstrated the possibility of\nlowering the analysis threshold by at least 10eV.",

In the widely accepted\n``chromospheric-evaporation condensation\" model, localized heating at\nfootpoints of a coronal loop drives plasma evaporation and eventually triggers\ncondensation. The occurrence of condensation is strongly influenced by the\ncharacteristics of the heating.Various theoretical studies have been conducted\nalong one-dimensional field lines with quasi-steady localized heating. The\nquasi-steady heating is regarded as the collection of multiple heating events\namong multiple strands constituting a coronal loop. However, it is reasonable\nto consider a single heating event along a single field line as an elemental\nunit.We investigated the condensation phenomenon triggered by a single heating\nevent using 1.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. By varying the\nmagnitude of the localized heating rate, we explored the conditions necessary\nfor condensation. We found that when a heating rate approximately $\\sim 10^{4}$\ntimes greater than that of steady heating was applied, condensation occurred.\nCondensation was observed when the thermal conduction efficiency in the loop\nbecame lower than the cooling efficiency, with the cooling rate significantly\nexceeding the heating rate. Using the loop length $L$ and the Field length\n$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{F}}$, the condition for condensation is expressed as\n$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{F}} \\lesssim L/2$ under conditions where cooling exceeds\nheating.

In parallel, key aspects of four-dimensional gauge dynamics with eight\nsupercharges are explored, including electric-magnetic duality, Seiberg-Witten\ntheory, and class $\\mathcal S$ theories. The role of spectral networks as a\nframework for determining and analyzing BPS spectra in class $\\mathcal S$\ntheories is then examined. The final chapter outlines recent applications of\nspectral networks across a range of contemporary research areas. This volume is\nintended for researchers and advanced students in either mathematics or physics\nwho wish to enter the field.",

However, this region contains the most massive complex stellar\ncomponent of the MW, the bulge, primarily composed of disc stars whose\nstructure is (re-)shaped by the evolution of the bar. In this work, we extend\nthe application of the orbit superposition method to explore the present-day 3D\nstructure, orbital composition, chemical abundance trends and kinematics of the\nMW bulge. Thanks to our approach, we are able to transfer astrometry from Gaia\nand stellar parameters from APOGEE DR 17 to map the inner MW without\nobscuration by the survey footprint and selection function. We demonstrate that\nthe MW bulge is made of two main populations originating from a metal-poor,\nhigh-{\\alpha} thick disc and a metal-rich, low-{\\alpha} thin disc, with a mass\nratio of 4:3, seen as two major components in the MDF. Finer MDF structures\nhint at multiple sub-populations associated with different orbital families of\nthe bulge, which, however, have broad MDFs themselves. Decomposition using 2D\nGMMs in [Fe/H] -[Mg/Fe] identifies five components including a population with\nex-situ origin. Two dominant ones correspond to the thin and thick discs and\ntwo in between trace the transition between them. We show that no universal\nmetallicity gradient value can characterise the MW bulge. The radial gradients\nclosely trace the X-shaped bulge density structure, while the vertical gradient\nvariations follow the boxy component. While having, on average, subsolar\nmetallicity, the MW bulge populations are more metal-rich compared to the\nsurrounding disc, in agreement with extragalactic observations and\nstate-of-the-art simulations reinforcing its secular origin.",

Automatic generation of ADs remains challenging due to: i)\nthe domain gap between movie-AD data and existing data used to train\nvision-language models, and ii) the issue of contextual redundancy arising from\nhighly similar neighboring visual clips in a long movie. In this work, we\npropose DistinctAD, a novel two-stage framework for generating ADs that\nemphasize distinctiveness to produce better narratives. To address the domain\ngap, we introduce a CLIP-AD adaptation strategy that does not require\nadditional AD corpora, enabling more effective alignment between movie and AD\nmodalities at both global and fine-grained levels. In Stage-II, DistinctAD\nincorporates two key innovations: (i) a Contextual Expectation-Maximization\nAttention (EMA) module that reduces redundancy by extracting common bases from\nconsecutive video clips, and (ii) an explicit distinctive word prediction loss\nthat filters out repeated words in the context, ensuring the prediction of\nunique terms specific to the current AD. Comprehensive evaluations on MAD-Eval,\nCMD-AD, and TV-AD benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DistinctAD, with\nthe model consistently outperforming baselines, particularly in Recall@k/N,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in producing high-quality, distinctive ADs.",

On the other line, diffusion models\nhave also shown promise in robotic control tasks by denoising actions, known as\ndiffusion policy. Although the diffusion generative model and diffusion policy\nexhibit distinct capabilities--image prediction and robotic action,\nrespectively--they technically follow a similar denoising process. In robotic\ntasks, the ability to predict future images and generate actions is highly\ncorrelated since they share the same underlying dynamics of the physical world.\nBuilding on this insight, we introduce PAD, a novel visual policy learning\nframework that unifies image Prediction and robot Action within a joint\nDenoising process. Specifically, PAD utilizes Diffusion Transformers (DiT) to\nseamlessly integrate images and robot states, enabling the simultaneous\nprediction of future images and robot actions. Additionally, PAD supports\nco-training on both robotic demonstrations and large-scale video datasets and\ncan be easily extended to other robotic modalities, such as depth images. PAD\noutperforms previous methods, achieving a significant 26.3% relative\nimprovement on the full Metaworld benchmark, by utilizing a single\ntext-conditioned visual policy within a data-efficient imitation learning\nsetting. Furthermore, PAD demonstrates superior generalization to unseen tasks\nin real-world robot manipulation settings with 28.0% success rate increase\ncompared to the strongest baseline.

To accurately detect these hallucinations, we investigated the\nvariations in cross-modal attention patterns between hallucination and\nnon-hallucination states.

An automatically generated next-step\nhint can help them make forward progress and support their learning. It is\nimportant to know what makes a good hint or a bad hint, and how to generate\ngood hints automatically in novice programming tools, for example using Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs).\n  Method and participants: We recruited 44 Java educators from around the world\nto participate in an online study. We used a set of real student code states as\nhint-generation scenarios. Participants used a technique known as comparative\njudgement to rank a set of candidate next-step Java hints, which were generated\nby Large Language Models (LLMs) and by five human experienced educators.\nParticipants ranked the hints without being told how they were generated.\n  Findings: We found that LLMs had considerable variation in generating high\nquality next-step hints for programming novices, with GPT-4 outperforming other\nmodels tested. When used with a well-designed prompt, GPT-4 outperformed human\nexperts in generating pedagogically valuable hints. A multi-stage prompt was\nthe most effective LLM prompt. We found that the two most important factors of\na good hint were length (80--160 words being best), and reading level (US grade\n9 or below being best). Offering alternative approaches to solving the problem\nwas considered bad, and we found no effect of sentiment.\n  Conclusions: Automatic generation of these hints is immediately viable, given\nthat LLMs outperformed humans -- even when the students' task is unknown. The\nfact that only the best prompts achieve this outcome suggests that students on\ntheir own are unlikely to be able to produce the same benefit. The prompting\ntask, therefore, should be embedded in an expert-designed tool.",

    "abstract": "Path planning for wheeled mobile robots is a critical component in the field\nof automation and intelligent transportation systems. Car-like vehicles, which\nhave non-holonomic constraints on their movement capability impose additional\nrequirements on the planned paths. Traditional path planning algorithms, such\nas A* , are widely used due to their simplicity and effectiveness in finding\noptimal paths in complex environments. However, these algorithms often do not\nconsider vehicle dynamics, resulting in paths that are infeasible or\nimpractical for actual driving. Specifically, a path that minimizes the number\nof grid cells may still be too curvy or sharp for a car-like vehicle to\nnavigate smoothly. This paper addresses the need for a path planning solution\nthat not only finds a feasible path but also ensures that the path is smooth\nand drivable. By adapting the A* algorithm for a curvature constraint and\nincorporating a cost function that considers the smoothness of possible paths,\nwe aim to bridge the gap between grid based path planning and smooth paths that\nare drivable by car-like vehicles. The proposed method leverages motion\nprimitives, pre-computed using a ribbon based path planner that produces smooth\npaths of minimum curvature. The motion primitives guide the A* algorithm in\nfinding paths of minimal length and curvature. With the proposed modification\non the A* algorithm, the planned paths can be constraint to have a minimum\nturning radius much larger than the grid size. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed algorithm in different unstructured environments. In a\ntwo-stage planning approach, first the modified A* algorithm finds a grid-based\npath and the ribbon based path planner creates a smooth path within the area of\ngrid cells. The resulting paths are smooth with small curvatures independent of\nthe orientation of the grid axes and even in presence of sharp obstacles.",

    "abstract": "Greybox fuzzing has emerged as a preferred technique for discovering software\nbugs, striking a balance between efficiency and depth of exploration. While\nresearch has focused on improving fuzzing techniques, the importance of\nhigh-quality initial seeds remains critical yet often overlooked. Existing\nmethods for seed generation are limited, especially for programs with\nnon-standard or custom input formats. Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nrevolutionized numerous domains, showcasing unprecedented capabilities in\nunderstanding and generating complex patterns across various fields of\nknowledge. This paper introduces SeedMind, a novel system that leverages LLMs\nto boost greybox fuzzing through intelligent seed generation. Unlike previous\napproaches, SeedMind employs LLMs to create test case generators rather than\ndirectly producing test cases. Our approach implements an iterative,\nfeedback-driven process that guides the LLM to progressively refine test case\ngeneration, aiming for increased code coverage depth and breadth. In developing\nSeedMind, we addressed key challenges including input format limitations,\ncontext window constraints, and ensuring consistent, progress-aware behavior.\nIntensive evaluations with real-world applications show that SeedMind\neffectively harnesses LLMs to generate high-quality test cases and facilitate\nfuzzing in bug finding, presenting utility comparable to human-created seeds\nand significantly outperforming the existing LLM-based solutions.",

    "abstract": "Under pure textual modality, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated\nremarkable success in complex reasoning tasks by decomposing them into simpler\nsub-problems. However, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still struggle\nwith some seemingly straightforward visual tasks, such as counting and solving\njigsaw puzzles. We argue that these tasks challenge the ability of\nvisual-to-textual conversion, where MLLMs convert visual information perceived\nfrom the input scene, to textual information for further reasoning and\ngenerating the answer. If the complexity of the visual input is beyond the\nperceptual capability of the MLLMs, without decomposing this conversion\nprocess, simply scaling inference-time reasoning cannot solve the task because\nit repeatedly encounters the same perceptual bottleneck. We propose an\napproach, autonomous imagination, to enable MLLMs to iteratively modify visual\ninputs (e.g. isolating objects, rearranging puzzle pieces) into intermediate\nvisual states, decomposing visual-to-textual conversion into closed-loop visual\nmodification steps. We show that, without any retraining, MLLMs can now solve\ntasks initially beyond their perceptual capability, highlighting that\nclosed-loop visual modification can be an effective way of decomposing the\nvisual reasoning task into solvable substeps.

Valence quark GPDs of the kaon and pion are\nanalyzed with respect to their momentum fraction $x$ and skewness $\\xi$\ndependencies in the DGLAP and ERBL regions. We observe that the asymmetry of\nthe current quark masses in kaon results in a significant distortion of the\nquark GPDs in kaon near $\\xi=1$, compared to the case of the pion. The quark\nGPDs of the kaon and pion are evolved to $\\mu^2 = 4$ GeV$^2$ and 100 GeV$^2$ by\nthe QCD evolution equation at one-loop order using the \\texttt{APFEL++}\npackage. We find that the produced sea quarks and gluons are largely suppressed\nas $\\xi$ becomes nonzero, predominantly confined within the ERBL region. We\nsubsequently examine the polynomiality of the GPDs and numerically obtain the\nelectromagnetic and gravitational form factors of the kaon and pion. For the\nkaon, gravitational form factor ratios $A_{\\bar s/K^+}(0)/A_{s/K^+}(0) = 1.26$\nand $D_{\\bar s/K^+}(0)/D_{s/K^+}(0) = 1.10$ are reported and compared with\nresults from other effective models.",

The model under Onion incorporates\nphysical information by a multiplication process and applies the\nphysics-informed loss function according to the principle of line integration.\nPrediction results demonstrate that the additional input of physical\ninformation improves the deep learning model's ability, leading to a reduction\nin the average relative error E_1 between the reconstruction profiles and the\ntarget profiles by approximately 0.84x10^(-2) on synthetic datasets and about\n0.06x10^(-2) on experimental datasets. Furthermore, the implementation of the\nSoftplus activation function in the final two fully connected layers improves\nmodel performance. This enhancement results in a reduction in the E_1 by\napproximately 1.06x10^(-2) on synthetic datasets and about 0.11x10^(-2) on\nexperimental datasets. The incorporation of the physics-informed loss function\nhas been shown to correct the model's predictions, bringing the\nback-projections closer to the actual inputs and reducing the errors associated\nwith inversion algorithms.

The copper\nterminals are used for current injection and conduction cooling. An inherent\nvariation of the critical current along the CC length results from its\nmanufacturing process. This variation causes non-uniform heat generation,\nparticularly when the coil is operated at a high fraction of the nominal\ncritical current or when large critical current defects are present. The\ntemperature distribution resulting from the balance between cooling and\nheating, in combination with the magnetic field and critical current\ndistributions, determines whether a thermal runaway occurs. Accurately\npredicting the level of critical current defects that can be tolerated during\nconduction-cooled operation is difficult and requires a 3D coupled\nelectromagnetic and thermal simulation. This paper presents the results of\nsimulations that are performed with the open-source Finite Element Quench\nSimulator (FiQuS) tool developed at CERN as part of the STEAM framework. The 3D\ncoupled magnetodynamic-thermal simulations are based on the H-phi formulation\nand use thin shell approximations, a CC homogenization and conduction-cooling.\nThe critical current (Ic) is varied along the CC length. The effect of a single\ndefect specified as a reduction of Ic along the CC length is investigated in\nterms of the coil's ability to reach and maintain the operating conditions. The\nIc and length of the defect that results in a thermal runaway are analyzed in\nterms of defect location. In addition, a classical 1D scenario with a quench\nheater is studied. Both the local defect and the heater cases are compared in\nterms of the voltage signal available for quench detection. These cases result\nin very different requirements for quench detection, and their implications are\ndiscussed.",

Three\nnumerical examples - a Plate With a Hole, a Bridge, and a Hoover Dam example -\neach with multiple sensors distributed in different configurations, demonstrate\nthe procedure's capabilities. A target temperature distribution is prescribed\nin all cases, and the displacement sensor data is recorded.

Results show that the proposed approach can accurately\nreconstruct the target thermal distribution, especially when more sensors are\nused.

A comparison with standard\nspatial interpolation techniques, namely, k-nearest neighbors and ordinary and\nuniversal kriging, is performed using temperature sensors in the same\nconfigurations.

Surprisingly, our results show that\nthe hole closure at the outlet is enhanced by elastic effects for most\nparameter values. However, the opposite is true if the tube has a very large\nhole size at the inlet of the device or if the axial stretching is very weak.\nWe explain the physical mechanism underlying this phenomenon by examining how\nthe second normal stress difference induced by elastic effects modifies the\nhole evolution process. We also determine how viscoelasticity affects the\nstability of the drawing process and show that elastic effects are always\ndestabilizing for negligible inertia. This is in direct contrast to the case of\na thread without a hole for which elastic effects are always stabilizing. On\nthe other hand, our results show that if the inertia is non-zero, elastic\neffects can be either stabilizing or destabilizing depending on the parameters.",

In recent years, person\nre-identification (ReID) has also started to explore cross-modal semantics to\nimprove the accuracy of identity recognition. However, effectively utilizing\nLVLMs for ReID remains an open challenge. While LVLMs operate under a\ngenerative paradigm by predicting the next output word, ReID requires the\nextraction of discriminative identity features to match pedestrians across\ncameras. In this paper, we propose LVLM-ReID, a novel framework that harnesses\nthe strengths of LVLMs to promote ReID. Specifically, we employ instructions to\nguide the LVLM in generating one pedestrian semantic token that encapsulates\nkey appearance semantics from the person image. This token is further refined\nthrough our Semantic-Guided Interaction (SGI) module, establishing a reciprocal\ninteraction between the semantic token and visual tokens. Ultimately, the\nreinforced semantic token serves as the pedestrian identity representation. Our\nframework integrates the semantic understanding and generation capabilities of\nLVLMs into end-to-end ReID training, allowing LVLMs to capture rich semantic\ncues from pedestrian images during both training and inference. Our method\nachieves competitive results on multiple benchmarks without additional\nimage-text annotations, demonstrating the potential of LVLM-generated semantics\nto advance person ReID and offering a promising direction for future research.",

In order to learn model and\nregularisation parameters simultaneously, we develop in this paper a stochastic\nbilevel optimization approach in which the lower level problem represents a\nvariational reconstruction method formulated as a convex non-smooth\noptimization problem, depending on the observed sample. The upper level problem\nrepresents the learning task of the regularisation parameters. Combining the\nlower level and the upper level problem leads to a stochastic non-smooth and\nnon-convex optimization problem, for which standard gradient-based methods are\nnot straightforward to implement. Instead, we develop a unified and flexible\nmethodology, building on a derivative-free approach, which allows us to solve\nthe bilevel optimization problem only with samples of the objective function\nvalues.

The source term in this homogenized parabolic model is\ncharacterized by the solution of the homogenized Maxwells equations,\nincorporating an effective permittivity distribution derived from the Drude\nmodel under resonance conditions. Our analysis utilizes advanced tools in\npotential theory, asymptotic analysis and homogenization. By leveraging layer\npotential representations, we derive point-wise field approximations.

Consequently, this\nrestricts the practical application of these techniques, especially in cases\nwhere vendors are unable to provide timely patches. In this paper, we aim to\naddress the above limitations by performing vulnerability repair at binary code\nlevel, and accordingly propose a template-based automated vulnerability repair\napproach for Java binaries. Built on top of the literature, we collect fix\ntemplates from both existing template-based automated program repair approaches\nand vulnerability-specific analyses, which are then implemented for the Java\nbinaries. Our systematic application of these templates effectively mitigates\nvulnerabilities: experiments on the Vul4J dataset demonstrate that TemVUR\nsuccessfully repairs 11 vulnerabilities, marking a notable 57.1% improvement\nover current repair techniques. Moreover, TemVUR securely fixes 66.7% more\nvulnerabilities compared to leading techniques (15 vs. 9), underscoring its\neffectiveness in mitigating the risks posed by these vulnerabilities. To assess\nthe generalizability of TemVUR, we curate the ManyVuls4J dataset, which goes\nbeyond Vul4J to encompass a wider diversity of vulnerabilities.

    "abstract": "The value assessment of private properties is an attractive but challenging\ntask which is widely concerned by a majority of people around the world. A\nprolonged topic among us is ``\\textit{how much is my house worth?}''. To answer\nthis question, most experienced agencies would like to price a property given\nthe factors of its attributes as well as the demographics and the public\nfacilities around it. However, no one knows the exact prices of these factors,\nespecially the values of public facilities which may help assess private\nproperties. In this paper, we introduce our newly launched project ``Monopoly''\n(named after a classic board game) in which we propose a distributed approach\nfor revaluing private properties by learning to price public facilities (such\nas hospitals etc.) with the large-scale urban data we have accumulated via\nBaidu Maps. To be specific, our method organizes many points of interest (POIs)\ninto an undirected weighted graph and formulates multiple factors including the\nvirtual prices of surrounding public facilities as adaptive variables to\nparallelly estimate the housing prices we know. Then the prices of both public\nfacilities and private properties can be iteratively updated according to the\nloss of prediction until convergence. We have conducted extensive experiments\nwith the large-scale urban data of several metropolises in China. Results show\nthat our approach outperforms several mainstream methods with significant\nmargins. Further insights from more in-depth discussions demonstrate that the\n``Monopoly'' is an innovative application in the interdisciplinary field of\nbusiness intelligence and urban computing, and it will be beneficial to tens of\nmillions of our users for investments and to the governments for urban planning\nas well as taxation.",

    "abstract": "Mobile apps are essential in daily life, yet they often employ dark patterns,\nsuch as visual tricks to highlight certain options or linguistic tactics to nag\nusers into making purchases, to manipulate user behavior. Current research\nmainly uses manual methods to detect dark patterns, a process that is\ntime-consuming and struggles to keep pace with continually updating and\nemerging apps. While some studies targeted at automated detection, they are\nconstrained to static patterns and still necessitate manual app exploration. To\nbridge these gaps, we present AppRay, an innovative system that seamlessly\nblends task-oriented app exploration with automated dark pattern detection,\nreducing manual efforts. Our approach consists of two steps: First, we harness\nthe commonsense knowledge of large language models for targeted app\nexploration, supplemented by traditional random exploration to capture a\nbroader range of UI states. Second, we developed a static and dynamic dark\npattern detector powered by a contrastive learning-based multi-label classifier\nand a rule-based refiner to perform detection. We contributed two datasets,\nAppRay-Dark and AppRay-Light, with 2,185 unique deceptive patterns (including\n149 dynamic instances) across 18 types from 876 UIs and 871 benign UIs. These\ndatasets cover both static and dynamic dark patterns while preserving UI\nrelationships. Experimental results confirm that AppRay can efficiently explore\nthe app and identify a wide range of dark patterns with great performance.",

With the rapid advancement of deep learning, object detection\nalgorithms have been widely applied in this area. However, the distribution of\nobject classes in real-world prohibited item detection scenarios often exhibits\na distinct long-tailed distribution. Due to the unique principles of X-ray\nimaging, conventional methods for long-tailed object detection are often\nineffective in this domain. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the\nPrior-Aware Debiasing Framework (PAD-F), a novel approach that employs a\ntwo-pronged strategy leveraging both material and co-occurrence priors. At the\ndata level, our Explicit Material-Aware Augmentation (EMAA) component generates\nnumerous challenging training samples for tail classes. It achieves this\nthrough a placement strategy guided by material-specific absorption rates and a\ngradient-based Poisson blending technique. At the feature level, the Implicit\nCo-occurrence Aggregator (ICA) acts as a plug-in module that enhances features\nfor ambiguous objects by implicitly learning and aggregating statistical\nco-occurrence relationships within the image. Extensive experiments on the\nHiXray and PIDray datasets demonstrate that PAD-F significantly boosts the\nperformance of multiple popular detectors. It achieves an absolute improvement\nof up to +17.2% in AP50 for tail classes and comprehensively outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art methods.

Our experiments highlight that indeed, LLMs can serve as useful\nestimators of tabular data about specific entities across a range of domains,\nand that such estimations improve with model scale. Further, initial\nexperiments demonstrate the potential of LLMs to map a qualitative hypothesis\nof interest to relevant concrete variables that the LLM can then estimate. The\nconclusion is that LLMs offer intriguing potential to help illuminate\nscientifically interesting patterns latent within the internet-scale data they\nare trained upon.",

To address this gap, we propose a novel proximity-based\nframework for analyzing post hoc explanations to assess the interpretability of\ndeep learning models for solar flare prediction. Our study compares two models\ntrained on full-disk line-of-sight (LoS) magnetogram images to predict\n$\\geq$M-class solar flares within a 24-hour window. We employ the Guided\nGradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Guided Grad-CAM) method to generate\nattribution maps from these models, which we then analyze to gain insights into\ntheir decision-making processes. To support the evaluation of explanations in\noperational systems, we introduce a proximity-based metric that quantitatively\nassesses the accuracy and relevance of local explanations when regions of\ninterest are known. Our findings indicate that the models' predictions align\nwith active region characteristics to varying degrees, offering valuable\ninsights into their behavior. This framework enhances the evaluation of model\ninterpretability in solar flare forecasting and supports the development of\nmore transparent and reliable operational systems.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) can utilize\nlow-precision floating point (FP) quantization to deliver high efficiency while\nmaintaining original model accuracy. In particular, recent works have shown the\neffectiveness of non-power-of-two precisions, such as FP6 and FP5, and diverse\nsensitivity to low-precision arithmetic of LLM layers, which motivates mixed\nprecision arithmetic including non-power-of-two precisions in LLMs. Although\nlow-precision algorithmically leads to low computational overheads, such\nbenefits cannot be fully exploited due to hardware constraints that support a\nlimited set of power-of-two precisions (e.g., FP8, 16, 32, and 64 in NVIDIA\nH100 Tensor Core). In addition, the hardware compute units are designed to\nsupport standard formats (e.g., E4M3 and E5M2 for FP8). Such practices require\nre-designing the hardware whenever new precision and format emerge, which leads\nto high hardware replacement costs to exploit the benefits of new precisions\nand formats. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new accelerator\narchitecture, FlexiBit, which efficiently supports FP and INT arithmetic in\narbitrary precisions and formats. Unlike previous bit-serial designs, which\nalso provide flexibility but at the cost of performance due to its bit-wise\ntemporal processing nature, FlexiBit's architecture enables bit-parallel\nprocessing of any precision and format without compute unit underutilization.\nFlexiBit's new capability to exploit non-power of two precision and format led\nto 1.66x and 1.62x higher performance per area on GPT-3 in FP6 targeting a\ncloud-scale accelerator, compared to a Tensor Core-like architecture and a\nstate-of-the-art bit-parallel flexible precision accelerator, BitFusion,\nrespectively. Also, the bit-parallel nature of FlexiBit's architecture led to\n3.9x higher performance/area compared to a state-of-the-art bit-serial\narchitecture.",

The main components of Multitask-Gaze include\nUnidirectional Convolution (UC), Spatial and Channel Attention (SCA), Global\nConvolution Module (GCM), and Multi-task Regression Module(MRM).

The quasifission yield distributions of\n48Ca + 249Bk collision system utilizing SLy5t and T31 parametrizations exhibit\nmore pronounced spherical shell effects compared to those using SLy5, T44 and\nT62 sets. Furthermore, within each parametrization group, the distributions for\nSLy5t and T31 are closely aligned, as are those for SLy5, T44, and T62.\nSimilarly, the yield distributions for the 48Ti + 238U system using SLy5t and\nT31 also reflect the more pronounced spherical shell effects relative to SLy5\nand T62, while the charge distribution shows much better agreement with\nexperimental results for the SLy5t and T62 parametrizations compared to SLy5\nand T31. The yield distributions for the 48Ca+249Bk and 48Ti+238U systems, when\ncompared across the SLy5, SLy5t, T31, T44, and T62 parametrizations, indicate\nthat the influence of tensor forces on quasifission fragments is reflected in\nthe prominence of shell effects.

Unfortunately, these works still assume a bitwidth much\nlarger than 2, which falls far behind the state-of-the-art in quantization area\nand even challenges the meaningfulness of applying AppMuls in DNN accelerators,\nsince a high-bitwidth AppMul consumes much more energy than a low-bitwidth\nexact multiplier!

In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question and\npresent a systematic solution that achieves the answer: FAMES, a fast\napproximate multiplier substitution method for mixed-precision DNNs. Our\nexperiments demonstrate an average 28.67% energy reduction on state-of-the-art\nmixed-precision quantized models with bitwidths as low as 2 bits and accuracy\nlosses kept under 1%.

To make redshift models more\ngeneralizable to the broader galaxy population, we investigate transfer\nlearning and directly combining ground truth redshifts derived from photometry\nand spectroscopy. We use the COSMOS2020 survey to create a dataset, TransferZ,\nwhich includes photometric redshift estimates derived from up to 35 imaging\nfilters using template fitting. This dataset spans a wider range of galaxy\ntypes and colors compared to spectroscopic samples, though its redshift\nestimates are less accurate. We first train a base neural network on TransferZ\nand then refine it using transfer learning on a dataset of galaxies with more\nprecise spectroscopic redshifts (GalaxiesML). In addition, we train a neural\nnetwork on a combined dataset of TransferZ and GalaxiesML. Both methods reduce\nbias by $\\sim$ 5x, RMS error by $\\sim$ 1.5x, and catastrophic outlier rates by\n1.3x on GalaxiesML, compared to a baseline trained only on TransferZ.

We use DECIGO detector as an example. Over 5 years,\nDECIGO is estimated to detect $\\sim$2,036 memory signals (SNRs $>$3) from\nstellar-mass BBHs. Simulations used frequency-domain memory waveforms for\ndirect SNR estimation. Predictions utilized a GWTC-3 constrained BBH population\nmodel (Power Law + Peak mass, DEFAULT spin, Madau-Dickinson merger rate). The\nanalysis used conservative lower merger rate limits and considered orbital\neccentricity. The high detection rate stems from strong memory signals within\nDECIGO's bandwidth and the abundance of stellar-mass BBHs. This substantial,\nconservative detection count enables statistical use of the memory effect for\nfundamental physics and astrophysics. DECIGO exemplifies that space\ninterferometers may better detect memory signals from smaller mass binaries\nthan their typical targets.

    "abstract": "Supernova explosions are among the most extreme events in the Universe,\nmaking them a promising environment in which to search for the effects of\nlight, weakly coupled new particles. As significant sources of energy, they are\nknown to have an important effect on the dynamics of ordinary matter in their\nhost galaxies but their potential impact on the dark matter (DM) halo remains\nless explored. In this work, we investigate the possibility that some fraction\nof the supernova energy is released via the form of dark radiation into the DM\nhalo. Based on evaluation of energetics, we find that even a small fraction of\nthe total SN energy is sufficient to change the overall shape of the DM halo\nand transform a cuspy halo into a cored one. This may help to explain the cores\nthat are observed in some dwarf galaxies. Alternatively, one can interpret the\nupper limit on the size of a possible DM core as an upper limit on the energy\nthat can go into light particles beyond the SM. These arguments are largely\nindependent of a concrete model for the new physics. Nevertheless, it is\nimportant to ensure that the conditions we need, i.e.~significant supernova\nemissivity of dark radiation and the opacity of DM halo to the dark radiation,\ncan be met in actual models. To demonstrate this, we study four simple\nbenchmark models: the dark photon, dark Higgs, and gauged $B-L$ and $L_\\mu -\nL_\\tau$ models -- all provide light weakly coupled particles serving as the\ndark radiation. Assuming a sizable coupling of the dark radiation to DM, we\nfind that all of the benchmark models have a significant part of the parameter\nspace that meets the conditions. Interestingly, the couplings allowed by\nobservations of SN1987A can have a significant effect on the halo of dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies.",

The curves cover the past four decades and are selected from the\nAAVSO database as including a very large number of high-density and\nhigh-quality observations. The aim of the analysis is to offer a more precise,\nmore quantitative and more systematic picture than available from earlier\nstudies. The results corroborate earlier descriptions and reveal new\ncorrelations between the shapes of the light curves and the evolution of the\nstar along the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). A family of nearly sinusoidal\ncurves associated with M spectral types and displaying no sign of having\nexperienced third-dredge-up events, is identified with good confidence. A\ndetailed study of its properties is presented and used to suggest possible\ninterpretations. All other curves are clearly distinct from this family and\nusually start departing from it by displaying a broader luminosity minimum,\nprogressively taking the form of a hump climbing the ascending branch as the\nstar evolves along the AGB. The properties displayed by this hump are studied\nin some detail and possible interpretations are considered. New correlations\nbetween parameters defining the shape of the light curve and the state of the\nstar are revealed; while the average trend is established with good confidence,\ndeviations from it cause a significant scatter of the parameters defining the\nshapes of the curves. Comments aimed at shedding light on the underlying\nphysics are presented together with speculative interpretations, in the hope\nthat they could encourage and inspire new studies, in particular based on\nsimulations using state-of-the-art models of the inner star dynamics.",

However,\nexisting methods for MTS often struggle due to the challenges of effectively\nmodeling high-dimensional data and the lack of labeled data, resulting in poor\nclassification performance. To address this issue, we propose a heterogeneous\nrelationships of subjects and shapelets method for semi-supervised MTS\nclassification. This method offers a novel perspective by integrating various\ntypes of additional information while capturing the relationships between them.\nSpecifically, we first utilize a contrast temporal self-attention module to\nobtain sparse MTS representations, and then model the similarities between\nthese representations using soft dynamic time warping to construct a similarity\ngraph. Secondly, we learn the shapelets for different subject types,\nincorporating both the subject features and their shapelets as additional\ninformation to further refine the similarity graph, ultimately generating a\nheterogeneous graph. Finally, we use a dual level graph attention network to\nget prediction. Through this method, we successfully transform dataset into a\nheterogeneous graph, integrating multiple additional information and achieving\nprecise semi-supervised node classification. Experiments on the Human Activity\nRecognition, sleep stage classification and University of East Anglia datasets\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in MTS\nclassification tasks, validating its superiority.",

    "abstract": "The majority of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way (MW) show disk-like\ndistributions (the disk of satellites; DoS), which is a small-scale problem of\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The conventional definition of the MW-like DoS is a\nsatellite system with a minor-to-major axis ratio ($c$/$a$) lower than the MW's\n$c$/$a$ value of 0.181. Here we question the validity of the $c$/$a$-based DoS\nrarity assessment and propose an alternative approach. How satellites are\nplaced around a galaxy is dictated mainly by two factors: the distributions of\nsatellites' orbital poles and distances from the host. Based on this premise,\nwe construct the `satellite distribution generator' code and generate 10$^5$\n`spatially and kinematically analogous systems (SKASs)' sharing these two\nfactors. The SKAS can disclose the intrinsic, underlying $c$/$a$ probability\ndistribution function (PDF), from which a present-day $c$/$a$ value is\nfortuitously determined. We find that the $c$/$a$ PDF of the MW DoS defined by\n11 classical satellites is quite broad ($\\sigma_{c/a}$$\\sim$0.105), implying\nthat a simple present-day $c$/$a$ value, combined with its highly time-variable\nnature, cannot fully represent the degree of flatness. Moreover, based on the\nintrinsic $c$/$a$ PDF, we re-evaluate the rarity of the MW DoS by comparing it\nwith IllustrisTNG50-1 host-satellite systems and find that even with the new\nmeasure, the MW DoS remains rare (0.00$\\sim$3.40%). We show that the reason\nbehind the rareness is that both orbital poles and distances of the 11 MW\nsatellites are far more plane-friendly than those of simulated host-satellite\nsystems, challenging the current structure and galaxy formation model.",

However, emerging work argues that the\nbuilding blocks of normativity emerged much earlier in evolution than\npreviously considered. In light of this, we argue that normative processes must\nbe taken into account to consider the evolution of even ancient processes such\nas affect. We show through an agent-based model (with an evolvable model of\naffect) that different affective dispositions emerge when taking into account\nsocial maintenance. Further, we demonstrate that social maintenance results in\nthe emergence of a minimal population regulation mechanism in a dynamic\nenvironment, without the need to predict the state of the environment or reason\nabout the mental state of others. We use a cultural interpretation of our model\nto derive a new definition of norm emergence which distinguishes between\nindirect and direct social maintenance. Indirect social maintenance tends to\none equilibrium (similar to environmental scaffolding) and the richer direct\nsocial maintenance results in many possible equilibria in behaviour, capturing\nan important aspect of normative behaviour in that it bears a certain degree of\narbitrariness. We also distinguish between single-variable and mechanistic\nnormative regularities. A mechanistic regularity, rather than a particular\nbehaviour specified by one value e.g. walking speed, is a collection of values\nthat specify a culturally patterned version of a psychological mechanism e.g. a\ndisposition.

The space environment, where\nwill be immersed in, is responsible for charge accumulation on its free falling\ntest masses (TMs) due to the galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar energetic\nparticles (SEP) impinging on the spacecraft. Primary and secondary particles\nproduced in the spacecraft material eventually reach the TMs by depositing a\nnet positive charge fluctuating in time. This work is relevant for any present\nand future space missions that, like LISA, host free-falling TMs as inertial\nreference. Aims. The coupling of the TM charge with native stray electrostatic\nfield produces noise forces on the TMs, which can limit the performance of the\nLISA mission. A precise knowledge of the charging process allows us to predict\nthe intensity of these charge-induced disturbances and to design specific\ncounter-measures. Methods. We present a comprehensive toolkit that allows us to\ncalculate the TM charging time-series in a geometry representative of LISA\nmission, and the associated induced forces under different conditions of the\nspace environment by considering the effects of short, long GCR flux\nmodulations and SEPs. Results.

From\nthat, we find the local constraints satisfied by the Laurent coefficients of\nthe invariant polynomials in the Higgs field, for all twisted punctures in\n$A_{2n}$, for all n.

Manually writing reproduction scripts is a\ntime-consuming task with high requirements for developers. Hence, automation of\nbug reproduction has increasingly attracted attention from researchers and\npractitioners. However, the existing studies on bug reproduction are generally\nlimited to specific bug types such as program crashes, and hard to be applied\nto general bug reproduction. In this paper, considering the superior\nperformance of agent-based methods in code intelligence tasks, we focus on\ndesigning an agent-based framework for the task. Directly employing agents\nwould lead to limited bug reproduction performance, due to entangled subtasks,\nlengthy retrieved context, and unregulated actions. To mitigate the challenges,\nwe propose an Automated gEneral buG reproductIon Scripts generation framework,\nnamed AEGIS, which is the first agent-based framework for the task. AEGIS\nmainly contains two modules: (1) A concise context construction module, which\naims to guide the code agent in extracting structured information from issue\ndescriptions, identifying issue-related code with detailed explanations, and\nintegrating these elements to construct the concise context; (2) A FSM-based\nmulti-feedback optimization module to further regulate the behavior of the code\nagent within the finite state machine (FSM), ensuring a controlled and\nefficient script generation process based on multi-dimensional feedback.\nExtensive experiments on the public benchmark dataset show that AEGIS\noutperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 23.0% in F->P metric. In addition,\nthe bug reproduction scripts generated by AEGIS can improve the relative\nresolved rate of Agentless by 12.5%.",

This method is preferred for\nits simplicity, although the ion utilization efficiency is not optimized. Here\nwe employed another pulse-control method with a higher ion utilization rate,\nwhich is to bunch ions and kick them out instead of letting them stream. The\nbenefit of this method is that higher sensitivity can be achieved; since the\nstart of new ions cannot be allowed during TOF separation, it is highly\nadvantageous to bunch ions that would otherwise be unusable.

Therefore, assessing the quality of multi-objective\nresults using multiple indicators is essential to guarantee that the evaluation\nconsiders all quality perspectives. This paper proposes a novel multi-metric\ncomparison method to rank the performance of multi-/ many-objective\noptimization algorithms based on a set of performance indicators. We utilize\nthe Pareto optimality concept (i.e., non-dominated sorting algorithm) to create\nthe rank levels of algorithms by simultaneously considering multiple\nperformance indicators as criteria/objectives. As a result, four different\ntechniques are proposed to rank algorithms based on their contribution at each\nPareto level. This method allows researchers to utilize a set of existing/newly\ndeveloped performance metrics to adequately assess/rank multi-/many-objective\nalgorithms. The proposed methods are scalable and can accommodate in its\ncomprehensive scheme any newly introduced metric. The method was applied to\nrank 10 competing algorithms in the 2018 CEC competition solving 15\nmany-objective test problems. The Pareto-optimal ranking was conducted based on\n10 well-known multi-objective performance indicators and the results were\ncompared to the final ranks reported by the competition, which were based on\nthe inverted generational distance (IGD) and hypervolume indicator (HV)\nmeasures.

This structured approach significantly enhances the reformulation\ncapabilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that\nDRS improves the reformulation accuracy of GPT-3.5 from 23.03% to 70.42%, while\nalso enhancing the performance of open-source models, such as Gemma2-9B, from\n26.35% to 56.75%.",

    "abstract": "As machine learning becomes more widespread and is used in more critical\napplications, it's important to provide explanations for these models, to\nprevent unintended behavior. Unfortunately, many current interpretability\nmethods struggle with faithfulness. Therefore, this Ph.D. thesis investigates\nthe question \"How to provide and ensure faithful explanations for complex\ngeneral-purpose neural NLP models?\" The main thesis is that we should develop\nnew paradigms in interpretability. This is achieved by first developing solid\nfaithfulness metrics and then applying the lessons learned from this\ninvestigation to develop new paradigms. The two new paradigms explored are\nfaithfulness measurable models (FMMs) and self-explanations. The idea in\nself-explanations is to have large language models explain themselves, we\nidentify that current models are not capable of doing this consistently.\nHowever, we suggest how this could be achieved. The idea of FMMs is to create\nmodels that are designed such that measuring faithfulness is cheap and precise.\nThis makes it possible to optimize an explanation towards maximum faithfulness,\nwhich makes FMMs designed to be explained. We find that FMMs yield explanations\nthat are near theoretical optimal in terms of faithfulness. Overall, from all\ninvestigations of faithfulness, results show that post-hoc and intrinsic\nexplanations are by default model and task-dependent. However, this was not the\ncase when using FMMs, even with the same post-hoc explanation methods. This\nshows, that even simple modifications to the model, such as randomly masking\nthe training dataset, as was done in FMMs, can drastically change the situation\nand result in consistently faithful explanations. This answers the question of\nhow to provide and ensure faithful explanations.",

In existing works, users\noften interact with VideoLLMs by using the entire video and a query as input,\nafter which the model generates a response. This interaction format constrains\nthe application of VideoLLMs in scenarios such as live-streaming comprehension\nwhere videos do not end and responses are required in a real-time manner, and\nalso results in unsatisfactory performance on time-sensitive tasks that\nrequires localizing video segments. In this paper, we focus on a video-text\nduet interaction format. This interaction format is characterized by the\ncontinuous playback of the video, and both the user and the model can insert\ntheir text messages at any position during the video playback. When a text\nmessage ends, the video continues to play, akin to the alternative of two\nperformers in a duet. We construct MMDuetIT, a video-text training dataset\ndesigned to adapt VideoLLMs to video-text duet interaction format. We also\nintroduce the Multi-Answer Grounded Video Question Answering (MAGQA) task to\nbenchmark the real-time response ability of VideoLLMs. Trained on MMDuetIT,\nMMDuet demonstrates that adopting the video-text duet interaction format\nenables the model to achieve significant improvements in various time-sensitive\ntasks (76% CIDEr on YouCook2 dense video captioning, 90\\% mAP on QVHighlights\nhighlight detection and 25% R@0.5 on Charades-STA temporal video grounding)\nwith minimal training efforts, and also enable VideoLLMs to reply in a\nreal-time manner as the video plays.

In particular, few analytical models enable\naccurate liquidus and eutectic prediction based only on bulk thermodynamic\nproperties of the pure components, requiring instead either direct measurement\nor costly simulation of solution properties. In this work, we demonstrate that\na simple modification to the canonical ideal solution theory accounting for the\nentopic effects of dissimilar molecule sizes can transform its predictive\npower, while offering new insight into the thermodynamic nature of aqueous\norganic solutions. Incorporating a Flory-style entropy of mixing term that\nincludes both the mole and volume fractions of each component, we derive\nsize-dependent equations for the ideal chemical potential and liquidus\ntemperature, and use them to predict the binary phase diagrams of water and 10\norganic solutes of varying sizes. We show that size-dependent prediction\noutperforms the ideal model in all cases, reducing average error in the\npredicted liquidus temperature by 59\\%, eutectic temperature by 45\\%, and\neutectic composition by 43\\%, as compared to experimental data. Furthermore, by\nretaining the ideal assumption that the enthalpy of mixing is zero, we\ndemonstrate that for aqueous organic solutions, much of the deviation from\nideality that is typically attributed to molecular interactions may in fact be\nexplained by simple entropic size effects. These results suggest an\nunderappreciated dominance of mixing entropy in these solutions, and provide a\nsimple approach to predicting their phase equilibria.",

In recent years, the introduction of deep learning techniques has\nsignificantly advanced the development of aBCIs. However, the current emotion\nrecognition methods based on deep transfer learning face the challenge of the\ndual dependence of the model on source domain and target domain, As well as\nbeing affected by label noise, which seriously affects the performance and\ngeneralization ability of the model. To overcome this limitation, we proposes a\nPairwise Learning framework with Domain and Category Prototypes for EEG emotion\nrecognition under unseen target conditions (PL-DCP), and integrating concepts\nof feature disentanglement and prototype inference. Here, the feature\ndisentanglement module extracts and decouples the emotional EEG features to\nform domain features and class features, and further calculates the dual\nprototype representation. The Domain-pprototype captures the individual\nvariations across subjects, while the class-prototype captures the\ncross-individual commonality of emotion categories. In addition, the pairwise\nlearning strategy effectively reduces the noise effect caused by wrong labels.\nThe PL-DCP framework conducts a systematic experimental evaluation on the\npublished datasets SEED, SEED-IV and SEED-V, and the accuracy are 82.88\\%,\n65.15\\% and 61.29\\%, respectively. The results show that compared with other\nState-of-the-Art(SOTA) Methods, the PL-DCP model still achieves slightly better\nperformance than the deep transfer learning method that requires both source\nand target data, although the target domain is completely unseen during the\ntraining.

In this work, we present an adapted framework from QuaLLM into\nQuaLLM-Health for extracting clinically relevant quantitative data from Reddit\ndiscussions about glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists using large\nlanguage models (LLMs). We collected 410k posts and comments from five\nGLP-1-related communities using the Reddit API in July 2024. After filtering\nfor cancer-related discussions, 2,059 unique entries remained. We developed\nannotation guidelines to manually extract variables such as cancer\nsurvivorship, family cancer history, cancer types mentioned, risk perceptions,\nand discussions with physicians. Two domain-experts independently annotated a\nrandom sample of 100 entries to create a gold-standard dataset. We then\nemployed iterative prompt engineering with OpenAI's \"GPT-4o-mini\" on the\ngold-standard dataset to build an optimized pipeline that allowed us to extract\nvariables from the large dataset. The optimized LLM achieved accuracies above\n0.85 for all variables, with precision, recall and F1 score macro averaged >\n0.90, indicating balanced performance. Stability testing showed a 95% match\nrate across runs, confirming consistency. Applying the framework to the full\ndataset enabled efficient extraction of variables necessary for downstream\nanalysis, costing under $3 and completing in approximately one hour.\nQuaLLM-Health demonstrates that LLMs can effectively and efficiently extract\nclinically relevant quantitative data from unstructured social media content.\nIncorporating human expertise and iterative prompt refinement ensures accuracy\nand reliability. This methodology can be adapted for large-scale analysis of\npatient-generated data across various health domains, facilitating valuable\ninsights for healthcare research.",

    "abstract": "As AI systems grow increasingly specialized and complex, managing hardware\nheterogeneity becomes a pressing challenge. How can we efficiently coordinate\nand synchronize heterogeneous hardware resources to achieve high utilization?\nHow can we minimize the friction of transitioning between diverse computation\nphases, reducing costly stalls from initialization, pipeline setup, or drain?\nOur insight is that a network abstraction at the ISA level naturally unifies\nheterogeneous resource orchestration and phase transitions.\n  This paper presents a Reconfigurable Stream Network Architecture (RSN), a\nnovel ISA abstraction designed for the DNN domain. RSN models the datapath as a\ncircuit-switched network with stateful functional units as nodes and data\nstreaming on the edges. Programming a computation corresponds to triggering a\npath. Software is explicitly exposed to the compute and communication latency\nof each functional unit, enabling precise control over data movement for\noptimizations such as compute-communication overlap and layer fusion. As nodes\nin a network naturally differ, the RSN abstraction can efficiently virtualize\nheterogeneous hardware resources by separating control from the data plane,\nenabling low instruction-level intervention.\n  We build a proof-of-concept design RSN-XNN on VCK190, a heterogeneous\nplatform with FPGA fabric and AI engines. Compared to the SOTA solution on this\nplatform, it reduces latency by 6.1x and improves throughput by 2.4x-3.2x.\nCompared to the T4 GPU with the same FP32 performance, it matches latency with\nonly 18% of the memory bandwidth.

    "abstract": "The notion of topological order (TO) can be defined through the\ncharacteristic ground state degeneracy of a system placed on a manifold with\nnon-zero genus $g$, such as a torus. This ground state degeneracy has served as\na key tool for identifying TOs in theoretical calculations but it has never\nbeen possible to probe experimentally because fabricating a device in the\nrequisite toroidal geometry is generally not feasible. Here we discuss a\npractical method that can be used to overcome this difficulty in a class of\ntopologically ordered systems that consist of a TO and its time reversal\nconjugate $\\overline{\\rm TO}$. The key insight is that a system possessing such\n${\\rm TO}\\otimes\\overline{\\rm TO}$ order fabricated on an annulus behaves\neffectively as TO on a torus, provided that one supplies a symmetry-breaking\nperturbation that gaps out the edge modes. We illustrate this general principle\nusing a specific example of a spin-polarized $p_x\\pm ip_y$ chiral\nsuperconductor which is closely related to the Moore-Read Pfaffian fractional\nquantum Hall state. Specifically, we introduce a simple model with\naltermagnetic normal state which, in the presence of an attractive interaction,\nhosts a helical $(p_x-ip_y)^\\uparrow\\otimes(p_x+ip_y)^\\downarrow$\nsuperconducting ground state. We demonstrate that when placed on an annulus\nwith the appropriate symmetry-breaking edge perturbation this planar\ntwo-dimensional system, remarkably, exhibits the same pattern of ground state\ndegeneracy as a $p_x+ ip_y$ superconductor on a torus.

In this work, we propose a\nsemi-Lagrangian adaptive rank (SLAR) integrator in the finite difference\nframework for linear advection and nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson systems without\ndimensional splitting. The proposed method leverages the semi-Lagrangian\napproach to allow for significantly larger time steps while also exploiting the\nlow-rank structure of the solution. This is achieved through cross\napproximation of matrices, also referred to as CUR or pseudo-skeleton\napproximation, where representative columns and rows are selected using\nspecific strategies. To maintain numerical stability and ensure local mass\nconservation, we apply singular value truncation and a mass-conservative\nprojection following the cross approximation of the updated solution. The\ncomputational complexity of our method scales linearly with the mesh size $N$\nper dimension, compared to the $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity of traditional\nfull-rank methods per time step. The algorithm is extended to handle nonlinear\nVlasov-Poisson systems using a Runge-Kutta exponential integrator. Moreover, we\nevolve the macroscopic conservation laws for charge densities implicitly,\nenabling the use of large time steps that align with the semi-Lagrangian\nsolver. We also perform a mass-conservative correction to ensure that the\nadaptive rank solution preserves macroscopic charge density conservation. To\nvalidate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, we conduct a series of\nbenchmark tests on both linear advection and nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson systems.\nThe propose algorithm will have the potential in overcoming the curse of\ndimensionality for beyond 2D high dimensional problems, which is the subject of\nour future work.",

Unlike\ntraditional deep learning frameworks, ReduNet constructs its parameters\nexplicitly layer by layer, with each layer's parameters derived based on the\nfeatures transformed from the preceding layer. Rather than directly using\nlabels, ReduNet uses the similarity between each category's spanned subspace\nand the data samples for feature updates at each layer.

To address this issue, based on the geometric interpretation of the\nnetwork parameters, this paper presents ESS-ReduNet to enhance the separability\nof each category's subspace by dynamically controlling the expansion of the\noverall spanned space of the samples.

    "abstract": "We present an extensive analysis of the relaxation dynamics of entangled\nlinear polymer melts via long-time molecular dynamics simulations of a generic\nbead-spring model. We study the mean-squared displacements, the autocorrelation\nfunction of the end-to-end vector, $P(t)$, the single-chain dynamic structure\nfactor, $S(q,t)$, and the linear viscoelastic properties, especially the shear\nstress relaxation modulus, $G(t)$. The simulation data are compared with the\ntheoretically expected scaling laws for different time regimes of entangled\nmelts, and with analytical expressions that account for different relaxation\nmechanisms in the tube model, namely, reptation, contour length fluctuation\n(CLF), and constraint release (CR). CLF involves a $t^{1/4}$ scaling regime in\nthe time-dependence of $(1-P(t))$. With increasing chain length, a gradual\ndevelopment of this scaling regime is observed. In the absence of CR, the tube\nmodel further predicts that at long times, the chain dynamics is governed by\none central quantity, the ``surviving tube fraction'' $\\mu(t)$. As a result,\none expects $S(q,t) \\propto G(t) \\propto P(t)$ in that time regime. We test\nthis prediction by comparing $S(q,t)$ and $G(t)$ with $P(t)$. For both\nquantities, proportionality with $P(t)$ is not observed, indicating that CR has\nan important effect on the relaxation of these two quantities. Instead, to a\nvery good approximation, we find $G(t)\\propto P(t)^{2}$ at late times, which is\nconsistent with the dynamic tube dilation or double reptation approximations\nfor the CR process. In addition, we calculate non-local mobility functions,\nwhich can be used in dynamic density functional theories for entangled\ninhomogeneous polymer blends, and discuss the effect of entanglements on the\nshape of these functions.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to binary classification using dynamic\nlogistic ensemble models. The proposed method addresses the challenges posed by\ndatasets containing inherent internal clusters that lack explicit feature-based\nseparations. By extending traditional logistic regression, we develop an\nalgorithm that automatically partitions the dataset into multiple subsets,\nconstructing an ensemble of logistic models to enhance classification accuracy.\nA key innovation in this work is the recursive probability calculation, derived\nthrough algebraic manipulation and mathematical induction, which enables\nscalable and efficient model construction. Compared to traditional ensemble\nmethods such as Bagging and Boosting, our approach maintains interpretability\nwhile offering competitive performance. Furthermore, we systematically employ\nmaximum likelihood and cost functions to facilitate the analytical derivation\nof recursive gradients as functions of ensemble depth. The effectiveness of the\nproposed approach is validated on a custom dataset created by introducing noise\nand shifting data to simulate group structures, resulting in significant\nperformance improvements with layers. Implemented in Python, this work balances\ncomputational efficiency with theoretical rigor, providing a robust and\ninterpretable solution for complex classification tasks with broad implications\nfor machine learning applications.

    "abstract": "Natural language often struggles to accurately associate positional and\nattribute information with multiple instances, which limits current text-based\nvisual generation models to simpler compositions featuring only a few dominant\ninstances. To address this limitation, this work enhances diffusion models by\nintroducing regional instance control, where each instance is governed by a\nbounding box paired with a free-form caption. Previous methods in this area\ntypically rely on implicit position encoding or explicit attention masks to\nseparate regions of interest (ROIs), resulting in either inaccurate coordinate\ninjection or large computational overhead. Inspired by ROI-Align in object\ndetection, we introduce a complementary operation called ROI-Unpool. Together,\nROI-Align and ROI-Unpool enable explicit, efficient, and accurate ROI\nmanipulation on high-resolution feature maps for visual generation. Building on\nROI-Unpool, we propose ROICtrl, an adapter for pretrained diffusion models that\nenables precise regional instance control. ROICtrl is compatible with\ncommunity-finetuned diffusion models, as well as with existing spatial-based\nadd-ons (\\eg, ControlNet, T2I-Adapter) and embedding-based add-ons (\\eg,\nIP-Adapter, ED-LoRA), extending their applications to multi-instance\ngeneration.

In particular, we focus on detecting a non-random\nsignal by capitalizing on the leading eigenvalue (a.k.a. Roy's largest root) of\nthe whitened sample covariance matrix as the test statistic. To this end, the\nwhitened sample covariance matrix is constructed via \\(m\\)-dimensional \\(p \\)\nplausible signal-bearing samples and \\(m\\)-dimensional \\(n \\) noise-only\nsamples. Since the signal is non-random, the whitened sample covariance matrix\nturns out to have a {\\it non-central} \\(F\\)-distribution with a rank-one\nnon-centrality parameter. Therefore, the performance of the test entails the\nstatistical characterization of the leading eigenvalue of the non-central\n\\(F\\)-matrix, which we address by deriving its cumulative distribution function\n(c.d.f.) in closed-form by leveraging the powerful orthogonal polynomial\napproach in random matrix theory. This new c.d.f. has been instrumental in\nanalyzing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of the detector. We also\nextend our analysis into the high dimensional regime in which \\(m,n\\), and\n\\(p\\) diverge such that \\(m/n\\) and \\(m/p\\) remain fixed. It turns out that,\nwhen \\(m=n\\) and fixed, the power of the test improves if the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) is of at least \\(O(p)\\), whereas the corresponding SNR in the high\ndimensional regime is of at least \\(O(p^2)\\). Nevertheless, more intriguingly,\nfor \\(m<n\\) with the SNR of order \\(O(p)\\), the leading eigenvalue does not\nhave power to detect {\\it weak} signals in the high dimensional regime.",
