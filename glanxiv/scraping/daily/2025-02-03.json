Citations from\nEinstein refer to principal contributions made by Newton, Maxwell and himself.\nEmphasis is placed on the cognitive value of differential (local,\ninfinitesimal) analysis of fundamental concepts (field structure, causality,\nfield relativistic transformations). The unity of electromagnetism is analyzed\nfrom the point of view of special relativity. It is clarified that descriptions\nsuggesting that the magnetic field is dispensable are contrary to the\nEinstenian approach: they assume that, to describe the interaction between\nmoving charges, there is a preferred coordinate system for each particular\nproblem. An introductory presentation of the tensor form of Maxwell equations\nis provided.",

    "abstract": "Bipartite graphs, representing two-mode networks, arise in many research\nfields. These networks have two disjoint node sets representing distinct entity\ntypes, for example persons and groups, with edges representing associations\nbetween the two entity types. In bipartite graphs, the smallest possible cycle\nis a cycle of length four, and hence four-cycles are the smallest structure to\nmodel closure in such networks. Exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs)\nare a widely used model for social, and other, networks, including specifically\nbipartite networks. Existing ERGM terms to model four-cycles in bipartite\nnetworks, however, are relatively rarely used. In this work we demonstrate some\nproblems with these existing terms to model four-cycles, and define new ERGM\nterms to help overcome these problems. The position of the new terms in the\nERGM dependence hierarchy, and their interpretation, is discussed. The new\nterms are demonstrated in simulation experiments, and their application\nillustrated on a canonical example of an empirical two-mode network.",

Our work makes two key contributions. First, for 3D cell segmentation,\nwe are the first work to formulate oversegmentation as a concrete problem and\npropose a geometric framework to identify and correct these errors. Our\napproach builds a pre-trained classifier using both 2D geometric and 3D\ntopological features extracted from flawed 3D segmentation results. Second, we\nintroduce a novel metric, \\emph{Geo-Wasserstein} divergence, to quantify\nchanges in 2D geometries. This captures the evolving trends in cell mask shape\nchanges in a geometry-aware manner. We validate our method through extensive\nexperiments on in-domain plant datasets, including both synthesized and real\ncases, as well as on out-of-domain animal datasets to demonstrate transfer\nlearning performance.

We adopt the weighted-residual integral\nboundary-layer model of Dietze and Ruyer-Quil (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 762, 2015,\npp. 68-109) to describe the dynamics of the mucus-air interface, as well as the\nflow in both phases. The transport of mucus induced by wall-attached cilia is\nalso considered, via a coarse-grained boundary condition at the base of the\nmucus. We show that the capillary-driven Rayleigh-Plateau instability plays an\nimportant role in particle deposition by drawing the mucus into large annular\nhumps and leaving substantial areas of the wall exposed to particles. We find,\ncounter-intuitively, that these mucus-depleted zones enlarge on increasing the\nmucus volume fraction. Particles spanning a range of sizes (0.1 to 50 microns)\nare modelled using the Maxey-Riley equation, augmented with Brownian forces. We\nfind a non-monotonic dependence of deposition on size. Small particles diffuse\nacross streamlines due to Brownian motion, while large particles are thrown off\nstreamlines by inertial forces -- particularly when air flows past mucus humps.\nIntermediate-sized particles are tracer-like and deposit the least. Remarkably,\nincreasing the mucus volume need not increase entrapment: the effect depends on\nparticle-size, because more mucus produces not only deeper humps that intercept\ninertial particles, but also larger depleted-zones that enable diffusive\nparticles to deposit on the wall.",

Other\nsuperconducting phases were retained in BST-II and -III at ambient pressure and\nsubjected to thermal and temporal stability testing. Superconductivity was also\nfound in BST with T$_c$ up to 10.2 K, the record for this compound series.\nWhile PQP maintains superconducting phases in BST at ambient pressure, both\ndepressurization and PQP enhance its T$_c$, possibly due to microstructures\nformed during these processes, offering an added avenue to raise T$_c$. These\nfindings are supported by our density-functional theory calculations.",

In this paper, we systematically\nunderstand, identify, and provide a better approach to address these\nchallenges. First, we design a comprehensive systemization of FL defenses along\nthree dimensions: i) how client updates are processed, ii) what the server\nknows, and iii) at what stage the defense is applied. Next, we thoroughly\nsurvey 50 top-tier defense papers and identify the commonly used components in\ntheir evaluation setups. Based on this survey, we uncover six distinct pitfalls\nand study their prevalence. For example, we discover that around 30% of these\nworks solely use the intrinsically robust MNIST dataset, and 40% employ\nsimplistic attacks, which may inadvertently portray their defense as robust.\nUsing three representative defenses as case studies, we perform a critical\nreevaluation to study the impact of the identified pitfalls and show how they\nlead to incorrect conclusions about robustness.

In this work, we consider a model named RL with segment feedback,\nwhich offers a general paradigm filling the gap between per-state-action\nfeedback and trajectory feedback. In this model, we consider an episodic Markov\ndecision process (MDP), where each episode is divided into $m$ segments, and\nthe agent observes reward feedback only at the end of each segment. Under this\nmodel, we study two popular feedback settings: binary feedback and sum\nfeedback, where the agent observes a binary outcome and a reward sum according\nto the underlying reward function, respectively. To investigate the impact of\nthe number of segments $m$ on learning performance, we design efficient\nalgorithms and establish regret upper and lower bounds for both feedback\nsettings. Our theoretical and experimental results show that: under binary\nfeedback, increasing the number of segments $m$ decreases the regret at an\nexponential rate; in contrast, surprisingly, under sum feedback, increasing $m$\ndoes not reduce the regret significantly.",

    "abstract": "We present a morphological analysis of ALMA and JWST NIRCam images of nine\ndusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at zspec=3.09, all embedded within the\ncosmic web filaments at the SSA22 proto-cluster core. The ALMA 870um and 1.1mm\nimages are obtained at spatial resolutions ranging from 0.5\" to 0.05\" (350 pc\nat z=3.09). The high-resolution images enable us to resolve inner structures\ntraced by dust continuum, identifying compact dusty cores, clumps, and offset\nridges within bars. Sersic profile fit was performed for both ALMA 870um and\nNIRCam F444W images at comparable resolutions (0.15\"). The Sersic index\nmeasured for 870um, masking bright regions, indicates values close to unity,\nsuggesting that dust emission arises from disks with superimposed compact core\ncomponents. For the JWST F444W images (restframe 1um), the Sersic indices range\nbetween nF444W = 1-3, pointing to the coexistence of bulges and stellar disks\nin these DSFGs. A comparison of dust mass surface density, nF444W, and\nF200W-F444W color (restframe 0.5-1um) reveals diversity among the DSFGs, likely\nreflecting different evolutionary stages including some DSFGs with red cores,\nindicating ongoing rapid bulge growth phases heavily obscured by dust. The\npredominantly disk-like morphologies observed in most DSFGs in the\nproto-cluster core contrast sharply with early-type morphologies that dominate\nthe highest density environment in the local universe. This suggests that we\nare witnessing the early formation of the morphology-density relation, as\nmassive galaxies undergo rapid growth as late-type galaxies fueled by cosmic\nweb gas filaments.",

Abundant prior works have studied transversal gates which are\nrestricted to acting on all logical qubits simultaneously. In this work, we\nstudy codes that support transversal gates which induce $\\textit{addressable}$\nlogical gates, i.e., the logical gates act on logical qubits of our choice. As\nwe consider scaling to high-rate codes, the study and design of low-overhead,\naddressable logical operations presents an important problem for both\ntheoretical and practical purposes.\n  Our primary result is the construction of an explicit qubit code for which\n$\\textit{any}$ triple of logical qubits across one, two, or three codeblocks\ncan be addressed with a logical $\\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate via a depth-one circuit of\nphysical $\\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates, and whose parameters are asymptotically good, up\nto polylogarithmic factors. The result naturally generalizes to other gates\nincluding the $\\mathsf{C}^{\\ell} Z$ gates for $\\ell \\neq 2$.\n  Going beyond this, we develop a formalism for constructing quantum codes with\n$\\textit{addressable and transversal}$ gates. Our framework, called\n$\\textit{addressable orthogonality}$, encompasses the original triorthogonality\nframework of Bravyi and Haah (Phys. Rev.

We demonstrate the power of this\nframework with the construction of an asymptotically good qubit code for which\n$\\textit{pre-designed}$, pairwise disjoint triples of logical qubits within a\nsingle codeblock may be addressed with a logical $\\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate via a\nphysical depth-one circuit of $\\mathsf{Z}$, $\\mathsf{CZ}$ and $\\mathsf{CCZ}$\ngates.

Phase I consisted of single mode\nfiber injection/extraction units (FIU/FEU) used in conjunction with a H band\npyramid wavefront sensor. The use of single mode fibers provides a gain in\nstellar rejection, a substantial reduction in sky background, and an extremely\nstable line spread function in the spectrograph.

A\nfleet-level scheduler, however, assumes a specific energy consumption during\ntask allocation, requiring the AGR to fully utilize the energy for maximum\nperformance, which contrasts with energy-efficient practices. This paper\naddresses this gap by investigating the combined impact of computing frequency\nand locomotion speed on energy consumption and performance. We analyze these\nvariables through experiments on our prototype AGR, laying the foundation for\nan integrated approach that optimizes cyber-physical resources within the\nconstraints of a specified energy budget. To tackle this challenge, we\nintroduce PECC (Predictable Energy Consumption Controller), a framework\ndesigned to optimize computing frequency and locomotion speed to maximize\nperformance while ensuring the system operates within the specified energy\nbudget. We conducted extensive experiments with PECC using a real AGR and in\nsimulations, comparing it to an energy-efficient baseline. Our results show\nthat the AGR travels up to 17\\% faster than the baseline in real-world tests\nand up to 31\\% faster in simulations, while consuming 95\\% and 91\\% of the\ngiven energy budget, respectively. These results prove that PECC can\neffectively enhance AGR performance in scenarios where prioritizing the energy\nbudget outweighs the need for energy efficiency.",

It is important\nfor 3D shape understanding, structural analysis and geometric modeling. We\nintroduce a novel fine-to-coarse unsupervised learning approach to abstract\ncollections of 3D shapes. Our architectural design allows us to reduce the\nnumber of primitives from hundreds (fine reconstruction) to only a few (coarse\nabstraction) during training. This allows our network to optimize the\nreconstruction error and adhere to a user-specified number of primitives per\nshape while simultaneously learning a consistent structure across the whole\ncollection of data. We achieve this through our abstraction loss formulation\nwhich increasingly penalizes redundant primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a\nreconstruction loss formulation to account not only for surface approximation\nbut also volume preservation. Combining both contributions allows us to\nrepresent 3D shapes more precisely with fewer cuboid primitives than previous\nwork. We evaluate our method on collections of man-made and humanoid shapes\ncomparing with previous state-of-the-art learning methods on commonly used\nbenchmarks. Our results confirm an improvement over previous cuboid-based shape\nabstraction techniques.

However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their\ndiscrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we\npresent a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize\nspherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed\nUVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a\nconcatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity,\nand rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be\ncompressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space\nusing a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be\ntreated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs\ntrained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new\nrepresentation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it\neffortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to\ndirectly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution\nto accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to\ntypical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel\ngeneration applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed\nsuperior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various\nunconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS\nbased on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial.",

    "abstract": "A Transient Stability-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (TSC-OPF) problem is\nproposed that enforces frequency stability constraints using Neural Network\n(NN) surrogate models. NNs are trained using a novel model-driven active\nsampling algorithm that iteratively generates NN training data located near the\nstability boundary and contained within the feasible set of the Alternating\nCurrent Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem. In the context of wholesale\nelectricity markets, pricing structures are analyzed along with their\ndependencies on the selected input features to the NN surrogate model. An\nimportant insight identifies a trade-off between the accuracy of the NN\nsurrogate model and sensible locational pricing structures. NN surrogate models\nfor frequency stability are validated by ensuring the resulting TSC-OPF\nsolution is stable over randomly generated load samples using a small Hawaii\ntest case. The proposed TSC-OPF problem is shown to significantly enhance\nfrequency stability at low computational cost and low financial cost to the\nsystem. For certain selections of NN inputs, the TSC-OPF problem is able to\nstabilize all load scenarios for which the solution to the AC-OPF problem\nresulted in instability.",

Our findings center\nclinicians' perspectives on aligning outcomes data for payment programs and\ncare; opportunities for health technologies and personal devices to improve\ndata collection; and considerations for using outcomes data to hold\nstakeholders including clinicians, health insurers, and social services\nfinancially accountable in value-based mental healthcare.

    "abstract": "While generative robot policies have demonstrated significant potential in\nlearning complex, multimodal behaviors from demonstrations, they still exhibit\ndiverse failures at deployment-time. Policy steering offers an elegant solution\nto reducing the chance of failure by using an external verifier to select from\nlow-level actions proposed by an imperfect generative policy. Here, one might\nhope to use a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a verifier, leveraging its\nopen-world reasoning capabilities. However, off-the-shelf VLMs struggle to\nunderstand the consequences of low-level robot actions as they are represented\nfundamentally differently than the text and images the VLM was trained on. In\nresponse, we propose FOREWARN, a novel framework to unlock the potential of\nVLMs as open-vocabulary verifiers for runtime policy steering. Our key idea is\nto decouple the VLM's burden of predicting action outcomes (foresight) from\nevaluation (forethought). For foresight, we leverage a latent world model to\nimagine future latent states given diverse low-level action plans. For\nforethought, we align the VLM with these predicted latent states to reason\nabout the consequences of actions in its native representation--natural\nlanguage--and effectively filter proposed plans. We validate our framework\nacross diverse robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating its ability to bridge\nrepresentational gaps and provide robust, generalizable policy steering.

The novelty of our\napproach is in abstracting the sequential steganographic embedding process as a\nConstrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), which takes into consideration the\nlong-term dependencies instead of merely the immediate effects. We constrain\nthe solution space such that the discounted accumulative total variation\ndivergence between the selected probability distribution and the original\ndistribution given by the LLM is below a threshold. To find the optimal policy,\nwe first show that the functional optimization problem can be simplified to a\nconvex optimization problem with a finite number of variables. A closed-form\nsolution for the optimal policy is then presented to this equivalent problem.\nIt is remarkable that the optimal policy is deterministic and resembles\nwater-filling in some cases.

    "abstract": "Ubiquitous geometric objects can be precisely and efficiently represented as\npolyhedra. The transformation of a polyhedron into a vector, known as polyhedra\nrepresentation learning, is crucial for manipulating these shapes with\nmathematical and statistical tools for tasks like classification, clustering,\nand generation. Recent years have witnessed significant strides in this domain,\nyet most efforts focus on the vertex sequence of a polyhedron, neglecting the\ncomplex surface modeling crucial in real-world polyhedral objects. This study\nproposes \\textbf{PolyhedronNet}, a general framework tailored for learning\nrepresentations of 3D polyhedral objects. We propose the concept of the\nsurface-attributed graph to seamlessly model the vertices, edges, faces, and\ntheir geometric interrelationships within a polyhedron. To effectively learn\nthe representation of the entire surface-attributed graph, we first propose to\nbreak it down into local rigid representations to effectively learn each local\nregion's relative positions against the remaining regions without geometric\ninformation loss. Subsequently, we propose PolyhedronGNN to hierarchically\naggregate the local rigid representation via intra-face and inter-face\ngeometric message passing modules, to obtain a global representation that\nminimizes information loss while maintaining rotation and translation\ninvariance. Our experimental evaluations on four distinct datasets,\nencompassing both classification and retrieval tasks, substantiate\nPolyhedronNet's efficacy in capturing comprehensive and informative\nrepresentations of 3D polyhedral objects.

    "abstract": "Kinetic plasma studies often require computing integrals of the velocity\ndistribution over a complex-valued pole. The standard method is to solve the\nintegral in the complex plane using the Plemelj theorem, resulting in the\nstandard plasma dispersion function for Maxwellian plasmas. For non-Maxwellian\nplasmas, the Plemelj theorem does not generalize to an analytic form, and\ncomputational methods must be used. In this paper, a new computational method\nis developed to accurately integrate a non-Maxwellian velocity distribution\nover an arbitrary set of complex valued poles. This method works by keeping the\nintegration contour on the real line, and applying a trapezoid rule-like\nintegration scheme over all discretized intervals. In intervals containing a\npole, the velocity distribution is linearly interpolated, and the analytic\nresult for the integral over a linear function is used. The integration scheme\nis validated by comparing its results to the analytic plasma dispersion\nfunction for Maxwellian distributions. We then show the utility of this method\nby computing the Thomson scattering spectra for several non-Maxwellian\ndistributions: the kappa, super Gaussian, and toroidal distributions. Thomson\nscattering is a valuable plasma diagnostic tool for both laboratory and space\nplasmas, but the technique relies on fitting measured wave spectra to a forward\nmodel, which typically assumes Maxwellian plasmas. Therefore, this integration\nmethod can expand the capabilities of Thomson scatter diagnostics to regimes\nwhere the plasma is non-Maxwellian, including high energy density plasmas,\nfrictionally heated plasmas in the ionosphere, and plasmas with a substantial\nsuprathermal electron tail.",

Traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) primarily utilize the\nmessage-passing mechanism, but their expressive power is limited and their\nprediction lacks explainability. To address these limitations, researchers have\nfocused on graph substructures. Subgraph neural networks (SGNNs) and GNN\nexplainers have emerged as potential solutions, but each has its limitations.\nSGNNs computes graph representations based on the bags of subgraphs to enhance\nthe expressive power. However, they often rely on predefined algorithm-based\nsampling strategies, which is inefficient. GNN explainers adopt data-driven\napproaches to generate important subgraphs to provide explanation.\nNevertheless, their explanation is difficult to be translated into practical\nimprovements on GNNs. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel\nself-supervised framework that integrates SGNNs with the generation approach of\nGNN explainers, named the Reinforcement Walk Exploration SGNN (RWE-SGNN). Our\napproach features a sampling model trained in an explainer fashion, optimizing\nsubgraphs to enhance model performance. To achieve a data-driven sampling\napproach, unlike traditional subgraph generation approaches, we propose a novel\nwalk exploration process, which efficiently extracts important substructures,\nsimplifying the embedding process and avoiding isomorphism problems.

    "abstract": "This thesis employs the dynamical systems approach to explore two\ncosmological models: an anisotropic dark energy scenario in a Bianchi-I\nbackground and the Generalized SU(2) Proca (GSU2P) theory in a flat FLRW\nbackground. In the first case, a numerical framework is developed to analyze\nthe interaction between a scalar tachyon field and a vector field, identifying\nparameter regions that allow anisotropic accelerated attractors. The second\ncase examines the viability of GSU2P as a driver of inflation and late-time\nacceleration. Our analysis reveals fundamental limitations, including the\nabsence of stable attractors and smooth cosmological transitions, ultimately\nruling out the model as a complete description of the Universe's expansion.\nThis work highlights the effectiveness of dynamical systems techniques in\nassessing alternative cosmological scenarios and underscores the need for\nrefined theoretical frameworks aligned with observational constraints.",

This approach\nmodifies the coupling between weakly and strongly occupied orbitals by applying\nan alternating orbital sorting strategy. In contrast to the previous orbital\nsorting that enforced electron pairing within subspaces of contiguous orbitals,\nthe new approach provides greater flexibility, enabling a calculation scheme\nwhere the size of the subspaces can be gradually expanded. As a consequence,\none can start using subspaces of only one weakly occupied orbital (perfect\npairing) and progressively enlarge their size by incorporating more weakly\noccupied orbitals (extended pairing) up to the maximum size allowed by the\nbasis set. In this way, the alternate orbital sorting allows solving first a\nsimpler problem with small subspaces and leverage its orbital solution for the\nmore intensive problem with larger subspaces, thereby reducing the overall\ncomputational cost and improving convergence, as we observed in the DoNOF\nprogram. The efficiency provided by the new sorting approach has been validated\nthrough benchmark calculations in H2O, H2O2, and NH3. In particular, we\ncompared three strategies: i) solving directly the calculation with the largest\nsubspaces (one-shot strategy), as was usually done before this work, ii)\nstarting with perfect pairing and stepwise increasing the number of orbitals in\nthe subspaces one by one until reaching the maximum size (incremental\nstrategy), and iii) starting with perfect pairing and transitioning directly to\nthe maximum subspace size (two-step strategy).

    "abstract": "The preservation of aquatic biodiversity is critical in mitigating the\neffects of climate change. Aquatic scene understanding plays a pivotal role in\naiding marine scientists in their decision-making processes. In this paper, we\nintroduce AquaticCLIP, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training model\ntailored for aquatic scene understanding. AquaticCLIP presents a new\nunsupervised learning framework that aligns images and texts in aquatic\nenvironments, enabling tasks such as segmentation, classification, detection,\nand object counting. By leveraging our large-scale underwater image-text paired\ndataset without the need for ground-truth annotations, our model enriches\nexisting vision-language models in the aquatic domain. For this purpose, we\nconstruct a 2 million underwater image-text paired dataset using heterogeneous\nresources, including YouTube, Netflix, NatGeo, etc. To fine-tune AquaticCLIP,\nwe propose a prompt-guided vision encoder that progressively aggregates patch\nfeatures via learnable prompts, while a vision-guided mechanism enhances the\nlanguage encoder by incorporating visual context. The model is optimized\nthrough a contrastive pretraining loss to align visual and textual modalities.\nAquaticCLIP achieves notable performance improvements in zero-shot settings\nacross multiple underwater computer vision tasks, outperforming existing\nmethods in both robustness and interpretability. Our model sets a new benchmark\nfor vision-language applications in underwater environments. The code and\ndataset for AquaticCLIP are publicly available on GitHub at xxx.",

    "abstract": "In the era of generative AI, integrating video generation models into\nrobotics opens new possibilities for the general-purpose robot agent. This\npaper introduces imitation learning with latent video planning (VILP). We\npropose a latent video diffusion model to generate predictive robot videos that\nadhere to temporal consistency to a good degree. Our method is able to generate\nhighly time-aligned videos from multiple views, which is crucial for robot\npolicy learning. Our video generation model is highly time-efficient. For\nexample, it can generate videos from two distinct perspectives, each consisting\nof six frames with a resolution of 96x160 pixels, at a rate of 5 Hz. In the\nexperiments, we demonstrate that VILP outperforms the existing video generation\nrobot policy across several metrics: training costs, inference speed, temporal\nconsistency of generated videos, and the performance of the policy. We also\ncompared our method with other imitation learning methods. Our findings\nindicate that VILP can rely less on extensive high-quality task-specific robot\naction data while still maintaining robust performance. In addition, VILP\npossesses robust capabilities in representing multi-modal action distributions.\nOur paper provides a practical example of how to effectively integrate video\ngeneration models into robot policies, potentially offering insights for\nrelated fields and directions.

The equations are defined on a one-dimensional bounded interval with\nDirichlet boundary conditions, continuous initial position and distributional\ninitial velocity. In the first part of this work, we study the corresponding\ndeterministic dynamics and prove that certain neighborhoods of asymptotically\nstable equilibria are uniformly attracting in the topology of uniform\nconvergence. Then, we consider exit problems for local solutions of the\nstochastic damped wave equations from bounded domains $D$ of uniform\nattraction. Using tools from large deviations along with novel controllability\nresults, we obtain logarithmic asymptotics for exit times and exit places, in\nthe vanishing noise limit, that are expressed in terms of the corresponding\nquasipotential. In doing so, we develop arguments that take into account the\nlack of both smoothing and exact controllability that are inherent to the\nproblem at hand. Moreover, our exit time results provide asymptotic lower\nbounds for the mean explosion time of local solutions. We introduce a novel\nnotion of \"regular\" boundary points allowing to avoid the question of boundary\nsmoothness in infinite dimensions and leading to the proof of a large\ndeviations lower bound for the exit place. We illustrate this notion by\nproviding explicit examples for different classes of domains $D$.

This is common in domains like speech, where the widely used\nconnectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss scales with input length and\nvaries with linguistic and acoustic properties, leading to spurious differences\nbetween group losses.

This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational\ncomplexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this\npaper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that\nleverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference\nefficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified\ninto two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where\nonly spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output,\nand (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different\nframes dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling\nstrategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of\nattention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout\ntransformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x\nand 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively,\nwhile preserving generation quality.

    "abstract": "Cass Sunstein's essay 'On Bob Dylan' describes Dylan's 'dishabituating' style\n-- a constant refusal to conform to expectation and a penchant for reinventing\nhis musical and lyrical identity. In this paper, I extend Sunstein's\nobservations through a large-scale computational analysis of Dylan's lyrics\nfrom 1962 to 2012. Using o3-mini-high (a large language model), I extract\nconcept-to-concept relationships from the lyrics and construct directed\nknowledge graphs that capture Dylan's thematic structure. I then quantify\nshifts in sentiment, metaphorical expression, thematic diversity, and network\ncomplexity over time. The results indicate that Dylan's lyrics increasingly\nrely on metaphor, display an evolving sentiment profile, and exhibit heightened\ndishabituation -- measured here as a growing variance in the network centrality\nof key concepts. I also find that references to movement, protest, and mythic\nimagery fluctuate in ways that align with well-known phases of Dylan's career,\nreflecting the dynamic and unpredictable quality of his art. These findings not\nonly deepen our empirical understanding of Sunstein's thesis but also introduce\na novel computational method for analyzing an artist's evolution-offering\nbroader applicability to the study of cultural and creative change.",

Higher bandwidths enhance signal\ntime resolution, while increased altitudes mitigate multipath and NLOS biases,\nboth contributing to improved performance. However, hovering close to RF\nsensors degrades accuracy due to antenna pattern misalignment and geometric\ndilution of precision.

In this work, we propose cooperative cavity quantum electrodynamic\n(cQED) coupling to achieve efficient nuclear spin readout.

We then evaluate the\nnNV-cQED system as an inertial sensor, indicating a rotation sensitivity\nimproved by three orders of magnitude compared to previous solid-state spin\ndemonstrations. Furthermore, we show that the NV electron spin can be\nsimultaneously used as a comagnetometer, and the four crystallographic axes of\nNVs can be employed for vector resolution in a single nNV-cQED system.

The origin of this strengthened C/O ratio may stem from the release of\nless complex hydrocarbons from the chemical processing of carbonaceous grains.\nWe have explored a set of 42 single-cell models in which we match the physical\nconditions to the inner regions of planet-forming disks, while varying the C/O\nratio by exploring different levels of CH$_4$, C, H$_2$O, and CO to the\ngas-phase chemistry, which we evaluate in both the cosmic/X-ray and UV-driven\nlimit.

A prime example of anomalous thermal relaxation is the\nMpemba effect, in which a system prepared at a hot temperature cools down to\nthe temperature of the cold environment faster than an identical system\nprepared at a warm temperature. Although reported for water more than 2000\nyears ago by Aristotle, the recent observations of analogous relaxation\nspeedups in a variety of systems have motivated the search for general\nexplanations. We review anomalous relaxation effects, which all share a\nnonmonotonic dependence of relaxation time versus initial ``distance\" from the\nfinal state or from the phase transition. The final state can be an equilibrium\nor a nonequilibrium steady state. We first review the water experiments and\nclassify the anomalous relaxation phenomena related to the Mpemba effect. We\nthen provide a modern definition of the Mpemba effect, focusing on the\ntheoretical frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, kinetic theory, Markovian\ndynamics, and phase transitions. We discuss the recent experimental and\nnumerical developments that followed these theoretical advances.

As an immediate consequence, a model may respond differently to the\nsame prompt if asked multiple times. In this work, we argue that the evaluation\nand ranking of large language models should control for the randomization\nunderpinning their functioning. Our starting point is the development of a\ncausal model for coupled autoregressive generation, which allows different\nlarge language models to sample responses with the same source of randomness.\nBuilding upon our causal model, we first show that, on evaluations based on\nbenchmark datasets, coupled autoregressive generation leads to the same\nconclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation but using provably fewer\nsamples. However, we further show that, on evaluations based on (human)\npairwise comparisons, coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation can\nsurprisingly lead to different rankings when comparing more than two models,\neven with an infinite amount of samples. This suggests that the apparent\nadvantage of a model over others in existing evaluation protocols may not be\ngenuine but rather confounded by the randomness inherent to the generation\nprocess. To illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct\nexperiments with several large language models from the Llama, Mistral and Qwen\nfamilies. We find that, across multiple benchmark datasets, coupled\nautoregressive generation requires up to 75% fewer samples to reach the same\nconclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation.

    "abstract": "We use order of magnitude estimates and observational constraints to argue\nthat feedback from relativistic cosmic rays (CRs) produced by massive black\nholes is likely to have a particularly large effect at radii of order the\nvirial radius and larger in group-mass halos. We show that for a range of\nplausible (but uncertain) CR transport parameters and energetics, the pressure\nproduced by CRs generated by the central massive black hole over its lifetime\ncan be of order the thermal gas pressure in the outskirts of $\\sim 10^{13-14}\nM_\\odot$ halos (but not in more massive clusters). The properties of this CR\nfeedback at low redshift are not well predicted by the radiative cooling rate\nof hot gas at smaller radii, which is often used as a proxy for `current' black\nhole feedback. This is because most black hole growth happens early in massive\nhalos, and CR transport timescales in halo outskirts are Gyr or more; the\naccumulated CR energy thus depends on the full history of black hole activity\nin the halo. The large CR pressure in group-mass systems likely leads to\nCR-driven outflows that move gas from large halo radii to outside the virial\nradius. Such feedback would not be captured by current cosmological simulations\nthat focus on mechanical black hole feedback; in particular, CR feedback\nremains active even long after the mechanical feedback sourcing the CRs has\nturned off. We speculate that this CR feedback may be important for explaining\nthe weak lensing $S_8$ tension and the evidence for strong feedback at large\nhalo radii from kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich measurements. Prospects for testing\nthis mechanism observationally and implementing the necessary physics in\ncosmological simulations are discussed.",

The streaming instability has been\nextensively modelled by hydrodynamic simulations of gas and a single dust size.\nHowever, more recent studies considering a more realistic case of a particle\nsize distribution show that this will significantly decrease the growth rate of\nthe instability. We follow up on these studies by evaluating the polydisperse\nstreaming instability, looking at the non-linear phase of the instability at\nthe highest density regions, and investigating the dust size distribution in\nthe densest dust structures. We employ 2D hydrodynamic simulations in an\nunstratified shearing box with multiple dust species representing an underlying\ncontinuous dust size spectrum using FARGO3D. To calculate the drag force on the\ngas due to a continuous dust size distribution, we apply the Gauss-Legendre\nquadrature method in dust size space. This method converges faster with the\nnumber of dust species than the usual uniform sampling method. The polydisperse\nstreaming instability is less efficient than its monodisperse counterpart in\ngenerating dense clumps that could collapse into planetesimals. In the densest\ndust structure, the larger dust sizes are more abundant because they are less\ncoupled to the gas and, therefore, can clump together more than the smaller\ndust grains. This trend is broken at the largest dust size due to\nsize-dependent spatial segregation of the highest-density regions, where\nparticles with the largest Stokes numbers are located just outside the densest\nareas of the combined dust species. This is observed as a peak in the size\ndistribution at the densest regions, which could relate to the size\ndistribution that ends up in the planetesimal after collapse and can mimic the\nsize distribution of dust growth.",

Tight CMB constraints on $f$\nalso apply to the generalized Chaplygin gas, except for models that are already\nquite close to $\\LCDM$, in which case all values of $0 \\le f \\le 1$ are\nallowed.

Here, we report 138 detections of the\nsmallest asteroids ($\\gtrapprox $10 m) ever observed in the main belt, which\nwere enabled by JWST's infrared capabilities covering the asteroids' emission\npeaks and synthetic tracking techniques. Despite small orbital arcs, we\nconstrain the objects' distances and phase angles using known asteroids as\nproxies, allowing us to derive sizes via radiometric techniques. Their\nsize-frequency distribution exhibits a break at ${\\sim}100$ m (debiased\ncumulative slopes of $q = -2.66\\pm0.60$ and $-0.97\\pm0.14$ for diameters\nsmaller and larger than $\\sim $100 m, respectively), suggestive of a population\ndriven by collisional cascade. These asteroids were sampled from multiple\nasteroid families--most likely Nysa, Polana and Massalia--according to the\ngeometry of pointings considered here. Through additional long-stare infrared\nobservations, JWST is poised to serendipitously detect thousands of\ndecameter-scale asteroids across the sky, probing individual asteroid families\nand the source regions of meteorites \"in-situ\".",

Although neutrino production in blazars has traditionally been\nattributed to processes in the powerful relativistic jet, the observation of a\nsignificant neutrino flux from NGC 1068 -- presumably coming from the Active\nGalactic Nucleus (AGN) corona -- suggests that neutrinos can also be produced\nin the cores of AGN. This raises the question whether neutrino production in\nTXS~0506+056 is also associated with the core region. We study this scenario,\nfocusing on the hypothesis that this blazar is a masquerading BL Lac, a\nhigh-excitation quasar with hidden broad emission lines and a standard\naccretion disk. We show that magnetic reconnection is an acceleration process\nnecessary to reach tens of PeV proton energies, and we use observationally\nmotivated estimates of the X-ray luminosity of the coronal region to predict\nthe emission of secondaries and compare them to the observed multi-wavelength\nand neutrino spectra of the source. We find that the coronal neutrino emission\nfrom TXS 0506+056 is too low to describe the IceCube observed neutrinos from\nthis AGN, which in turn suggests that the blazar jet remains the preferred\nlocation for neutrino production.",

To do so we compare\nthe features, compressibility, and learning dynamics of models trained via each\npath in two tasks. We find that grokked and steadily trained models learn the\nsame features, but there can be large differences in the efficiency with which\nthese features are encoded. In particular, we find a novel \"compressive regime\"\nof steady training in which there emerges a linear trade-off between model loss\nand compressibility, and which is absent in grokking. In this regime, we can\nachieve compression factors 25x times the base model, and 5x times the\ncompression achieved in grokking. We then track how model features and\ncompressibility develop through training. We show that model development in\ngrokking is task-dependent, and that peak compressibility is achieved\nimmediately after the grokking plateau.

After introducing the aims of the programme and describing\nits target clusters, we showcase the first results of the survey.

Ly$\\alpha$\narises when emitted photons scatter in neutral hydrogen and, so far,\nobservational efforts have mostly focused on the Ly$\\alpha$ surface brightness\nand spectral profile, which depend on the neutral hydrogen column density,\ngeometry, kinematics, powering mechanism and on the region from which the\nphotons are emitted. Different processes produce similar spectra, but have\ndifferent degrees of polarization, that we can use to discriminate between\nthem. In this paper, we present the first spectropolarimetric observations of a\ntypical star-forming galaxy at $z\\sim 3.4$, strongly lensed by the cluster of\ngalaxies Abell 2895, taken with the PMOS mode of the VLT/FORS2 instrument. We\nmeasure a Ly$\\alpha$ degree of polarization $1\\sigma$ upper limit of $4.6\\%$.\nWe develop new Ly$\\alpha$ radiative transfer models to reproduce the\nobservations, that can be explained by assuming the star-forming galaxy being\nembedded in a CGM with a biconical outflow geometry, with an opening angle of\nthe wind $\\theta_{o,Wind}\\sim 30^\\circ$ for line-of-sight angles $\\theta_{LOS}\n\\leq 20^\\circ$, $\\theta_{o,Wind}\\sim 45^\\circ$ for $\\theta_{LOS}\\leq 20^\\circ$,\n$\\theta_{o,Wind}\\sim 60^\\circ$ for $\\theta_{LOS}\\leq 20^\\circ$, and\n$\\theta_{o,Wind}\\sim 75^\\circ$ for $\\theta_{LOS}\\leq 40^\\circ$, where\n$\\theta_{LOS}=0^\\circ$ means observing in the direction of the outflow.

    "abstract": "Monitored many-body systems can exhibit a phase transition between entangling\nand disentangling dynamical phases by tuning the strength of measurements made\non the system as it evolves. This phenomenon is called the measurement-induced\nphase transition (MIPT). Understanding the properties of the MIPT is a\nprominent challenge for both theory and experiment at the intersection of\nmany-body physics and quantum information. Realizing the MIPT experimentally is\nparticularly challenging due to the postselection problem, which demands a\nnumber of experimental realizations that grows exponentially with the number of\nmeasurements made during the dynamics. Proposed approaches that circumvent the\npostselection problem typically rely on a classical decoding process that\ninfers the final state based on the measurement record. But the complexity of\nthis classical process generally also grows exponentially with the system size\nunless the dynamics is restricted to a fine-tuned set of unitary operators. In\nthis work we overcome these difficulties. We construct a tree-shaped quantum\ncircuit whose nodes are Haar-random unitary operators followed by weak\nmeasurements of tunable strength. For these circuits, we show that the MIPT can\nbe detected without postselection using only a simple classical decoding\nprocess whose complexity grows linearly with the number of qubits. Our protocol\nexploits the recursive structure of tree circuits, which also enables a\ncomplete theoretical description of the MIPT, including an exact solution for\nits critical point and scaling behavior. We experimentally realize the MIPT on\nQuantinuum's H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer and show that the experimental\nresults are precisely described by theory. Our results close the gap between\nanalytical theory and postselection-free experimental observation of the MIPT.",

In this system, planets b,\nc, and e are in (or near) a 6:3:1 three-body resonance even though the planets'\nperiod ratios show significant departures from exact two-body commensurability.\nImportantly, the intermediate planet d is not part of the resonance chain. To\nreach this resonance configuration, we propose a scenario in which there were\noriginally five planets in the system in a chain of first-order resonances.\nAfter disk dispersal, the resonance chain became unstable and two planets\nquickly merged to become the current planet d. In addition, the b/c/e\nthree-body resonance was re-established. We run N-body simulations using\nREBOUND to investigate the parameter space under which this scenario can\noperate. We find that our envisioned scenario is possible when certain\nconditions are met. First, the reformation of the three-body resonance after\nplanet merging requires convergent migration between planets b and c. Second,\nas has previously pointed out, an efficient damping mechanism must operate to\npower the expansion of the b/c/e system. We find that planet d plays a crucial\nrole during the orbital expansion phase due to destabilizing encounters of a\nthree-body resonance between c, d, and e. A successful orbital expansion phase\nputs constraints on the planet properties in the Kepler-221 system including\nthe planet mass ratios and the tidal quality factors for the planets. Our model\ncan also be applied to other planet systems in resonance, such as Kepler-402\nand K2-138.",

Our\nmass-complete sample includes primary galaxies with stellar masses of ${\\rm\nlog}(M_\\star/{\\rm M_\\odot}) = [8, 10]$, having major companions (mass ratio\n$\\geq 1/4$) selected by $5-30$ pkpc projected separation and redshift proximity\ncriteria.

Similarly, the\nderived galaxy major merger rate increases and flattens beyond $z \\sim 6$ to\n$2-8~{\\rm Gyr^{-1}}$ per galaxy, showing a weak scaling with stellar mass,\ndriven by the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function. A comparison\nbetween the cumulative mass accretion from major mergers and the mass assembled\nthrough star formation indicates that major mergers contribute approximately\n$3-13\\%$ to the total mass growth over the studied redshift range, which is in\nagreement with the ex-situ mass fraction estimated from our simple numerical\nmodel.

If thermal time crystals exist in holographic CFTs, they\nwould correspond to ensemble-dominating black holes with eternally time-varying\nexterior geometries. We point out that recent work on a conjectured non-linear\ninstability of slowly rotating Kerr-AdS$_4$ produced viable candidates for such\nstates. Then we show that the existence of holographic microcanonical time\ncrystals would imply violations of the AdS Penrose inequality (PI). We proceed\nto look for violations of the PI in spherical symmetry, working with\nEinstein-scalar gravity with the most general possible boundary conditions\ncompatible with boundary conformal invariance. We derive a set of ODEs for\nmaximally PI-violating initial data. Solving these numerically, we find strong\nevidence that in the particular case of spherical symmetry, the PI holds iff\nthe positive mass theorem (PMT) holds. This suggests that holographic CFT$_3$\ntime crystals can only possibly exist at non-zero angular momentum, at least in\nthe absence of electric charge. We also discover neutral hairy black holes in a\nconsistent truncation of M-theory that has a PMT and boundary conditions\nrespecting conformal invariance, disproving an existing no-hair conjecture.\nFinally, we show that previous PI-violating solutions by the author all existed\nin theories where the PMT is violated.

    "abstract": "Recent experimental results on the arrival direction of high-energy cosmic\nrays have motivated studies to understand their propagating environment. The\nobserved anisotropy is shaped by interstellar and local magnetic fields. In\ncoherent magnetic structures, such as the heliosphere, or due to\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence, magnetic mirroring can temporarily trap\nparticles, leading to chaotic behavior. In this work, we develop a new method\nto characterize cosmic rays' chaotic behavior in magnetic systems using\nfinite-time Lyapunov exponents. This quantity determines the degree of chaos\nand adapts to transitory behavior. We study particle trajectories in an\naxial-symmetric magnetic bottle to highlight mirroring effects. By introducing\ntime-dependent magnetic perturbations, we study how temporal variations affect\nchaotic behavior. We tailor our model to the heliosphere; however, it can\nrepresent diverse magnetic configurations exhibiting mirroring phenomena. Our\nresults have three key implications. (1)Theoretical: We find a correlation\nbetween the finite-time Lyapunov exponent and the particle escape time from the\nsystem, which follows a power law that persists even under additional\nperturbations. This power law may reveal intrinsic system characteristics,\noffering insight into propagation dynamics beyond simple diffusion.\n(2)Simulation: Chaotic effects play a role in cosmic ray simulations and can\ninfluence the resulting anisotropy maps. (3)Observational: Arrival maps display\nareas where the chaotic properties vary significantly; these changes can be the\nbasis for time variability in the anisotropy maps. This work lays the framework\nfor studying the effects of magnetic mirroring of cosmic rays within the\nheliosphere and the role of temporal variability in the observed anisotropy.",

In Study 1, clinicians were asked\nto provide an initial diagnosis (human), then view the AI's prediction, and\nsubsequently finalize their decision (human-AI team). In Study 2 (after a\nmemory wash-out period), the same participants first received aggregated\nperformance statistics from Study 1, specifically their own performance, the\nAI's performance, and their human-AI team performance, and then directly viewed\nthe AI's prediction before making their diagnosis (i.e., no independent initial\ndiagnosis). These two workflows represent realistic ways that clinical AI tools\nmight be used in practice, where the second study simulates a scenario where\ndoctors can adjust their reliance and trust on AI based on prior performance\nfeedback. Our findings show that, while human-AI teams consistently outperform\nhumans alone, they still underperform the AI due to under-reliance, similar to\nprior studies with crowdworkers. Providing clinicians with performance feedback\ndid not significantly improve the performance of human-AI teams, although\nshowing AI decisions in advance nudges people to follow AI more. Meanwhile, we\nobserve that the ensemble of human-AI teams can outperform AI alone, suggesting\npromising directions for human-AI collaboration.",

    "abstract": "We propose SCONE ($S$calable, $C$ontextualized, $O$ffloaded, $N$-gram\n$E$mbedding), a new method for extending input embedding layers to enhance\nlanguage model performance. To avoid increased decoding costs, SCONE retains\nthe original vocabulary while introducing embeddings for a set of frequent\n$n$-grams. These embeddings provide contextualized representation for each\ninput token and are learned with a separate model during training. After\ntraining, embeddings are precomputed and stored in off-accelerator memory;\nduring inference, querying them has minimal impact on latency due to the low\ncomplexity of embedding lookups. SCONE enables two new scaling strategies:\nincreasing the number of $n$-gram embeddings and scaling the model used to\nlearn them, both while maintaining fixed accelerator usage during inference (in\nterms of FLOPS and memory). We show that scaling both aspects enables a model\nwith 1B accelerator-resident parameters to outperform a 1.9B-parameter baseline\nacross diverse corpora, while using only about half the FLOPS and accelerator\nmemory during inference.",

Currently, most risk evaluations are conducted by designing inputs\nthat elicit harmful behaviors from the system. However, this approach suffers\nfrom two limitations. First, input-output evaluations cannot fully evaluate\nrealistic risks from open-weight models. Second, the behaviors identified\nduring any particular input-output evaluation can only lower-bound the model's\nworst-possible-case input-output behavior. As a complementary method for\neliciting harmful behaviors, we propose evaluating LLMs with model tampering\nattacks which allow for modifications to latent activations or weights. We pit\nstate-of-the-art techniques for removing harmful LLM capabilities against a\nsuite of 5 input-space and 6 model tampering attacks. In addition to\nbenchmarking these methods against each other, we show that (1) model\nresilience to capability elicitation attacks lies on a low-dimensional\nrobustness subspace; (2) the success rate of model tampering attacks can\nempirically predict and offer conservative estimates for the success of\nheld-out input-space attacks; and (3) state-of-the-art unlearning methods can\neasily be undone within 16 steps of fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to study the\nrotation curves of galaxies in the local universe. To do that, we first select\nthe galaxies with 9.4 $<$ $\\log{(M_\\mathrm{star}/M_\\odot)}$ $<$ 11.5 to make a\nsample comparable to that of SDSS/MaNGA observations. We then construct the\ntwo-dimensional line-of-sight velocity map and conduct the fit to determine the\nrotational velocity and the slope of the rotation curve in the outer region\n($R_\\mathrm{t}<r<3\\times r_\\mathrm{half,*}$). The outer slopes of the simulated\ngalaxies show diverse patterns that are dependent on morphology and stellar\nmass. The outer slope increases as galaxies are more disky, and decreases as\ngalaxies are more massive, except for the very massive early-type galaxies. The\nouter slope of the rotation curves shows a correlation with the dark matter\nfraction, slightly better than for the gas mass fraction. Our study\ndemonstrates that the observed dependence of galaxy rotation curves on\nmorphology and stellar mass can be successfully reproduced in cosmological\nsimulations, and provides a hint that dark matter plays an important role in\nshaping the rotation curve. The sample of simulated galaxies in this study\ncould serve as an important testbed for the subsequent study tracing galaxies\nback in time, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical origin behind the\ndiverse rotation curves.",

Recent studies have further shown that\nambient pressure superconductivity with a Tc exceeding 40K can be achieved in\ncompressively strained La3Ni2O7 thin films, offering a tunable platform for\ninvestigating the pairing mechanism in high-Tc nickelates. A comprehensive\nunderstanding of the structural and electronic properties of bilayer nickelate\nunder epitaxial strain is essential to advance this active field. In this work,\nwe employ first-principles calculations to systematically explore the entire\nrare-earth (Re) series of bilayer nickelates Re3Ni2O7 in the realistic\northorhombic Amam phase under various compressive and tensile strain\nconditions. We highlight the materials properties change when strain is\napplied, and compare these results with those observed under high pressure. Our\nfindings show that 2.5\\% compressive strain increases the apical Ni-O-Ni bond\nangle toward 180 degree, and causes the Ni $d_{z^2}$ bands to move away from\nthe Fermi level. The tight-binding parameters for the 2.5\\% compressively\nstrained La3Ni2O7 are quite similar to those of the unstrained material, except\nthat the on-site energy difference between the Ni $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$\norbitals increases by about 50 percent. Notably, the absence of the $d_{z^2}$\nbands at the Fermi energy under compressive strain contrasts sharply with the\nelectronic structure in the high-pressure {\\it Fmmm} phase, suggesting that the\npresence of $d_{z^2}$ bands at the Fermi energy may not be a requisite for\nsuperconductivity.",

However, we uncover a trade-off between generating\nunit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly\npredicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address\nthis trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test\ninputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on\ntask descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g.,\nfrom incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen\nvia test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and\nbacktracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and\nhelps LLMs debug effectively.

However, recent evidence suggests\ndiminishing returns from such approaches, motivating scaling the computation\nspent at inference time. Existing inference-time scaling methods, usually with\nreward models, cast the task as a search problem, which tends to be vulnerable\nto reward hacking as a consequence of approximation errors in reward models. In\nthis paper, we instead cast inference-time scaling as a probabilistic inference\ntask and leverage sampling-based techniques to explore the typical set of the\nstate distribution of a state-space model with an approximate likelihood,\nrather than optimize for its mode directly. We propose a novel inference-time\nscaling approach by adapting particle-based Monte Carlo methods to this task.\nOur empirical evaluation demonstrates that our methods have a 4-16x better\nscaling rate over our deterministic search counterparts on various challenging\nmathematical reasoning tasks.

In the analysis of quantum information processing tasks, the\nminimum entropy of a set of states, e.g., the minimum output entropy of a\nchannel, often plays a crucial role. A fundamental question in quantum\ninformation and cryptography is whether the minimum output entropy remains\nadditive under the tensor product of channels. Here, we establish a general\nadditivity statement for the optimized sandwiched R\\'enyi entropy of quantum\nchannels. For that, we generalize the results of [Devetak, Junge, King, Ruskai,\nCMP 2006] to multi-index Schatten norms. As an application, we strengthen the\nadditivity statement of [Van Himbeeck and Brown, 2025] thus allowing the\nanalysis of time-adaptive quantum cryptographic protocols. In addition, we\nestablish chain rules for R\\'enyi conditional entropies that are similar to the\nones used for the generalized entropy accumulation theorem of [Metger, Fawzi,\nSutter, Renner, CMP 2024].",

Three simulations of separate ISWs with initial\ndeep-water amplitudes in the range [136m, 150m] leverage a novel wave-tracking\ncapability for a propagation distance of 80km and accurately reproduce key\nfeatures of in-situ-observed phenomena with significantly higher spatiotemporal\nresolution. The interplay between convective and shear instability and the\nassociated turbulence formation and evolution, as a function of deep-water ISW\namplitude are further studied in-part revealing processes previously not\nobserved in the field. Across all three waves, the convective instability\ndevelops in a similar fashion. Heavier water entrained from the wave rear\nplunges into its interior, giving rise to transient, yet distinct, subsurface\nvortical structures. Ultimately, a gravity current is triggered which\nhorizontally advances through the wave interior and mixes it down to\npycnocline's base. Although the waveform remains distinctly symmetric,\nKelvin-Helmholtz billows emerge near the well-mixed ISW trough, disturb the\nwave's trailing edge and give rise to an active wake. The evolution of the\nkinetic energy associated with finer-scale perturbations to the ISW-induced\nvelocity field shows two different growth regimes, each dominated by either\nconvective or shear instability. The wake's perturbation kinetic energy is\nnonlinearly dependent on deep-water wave amplitude and can become a sizable\nfraction of the kinetic energy of the deep-water ISW.",

However, the 3D structure of\ntheir atmospheres makes observations more challenging to interpret,\nnecessitating 3D forward-modeling studies. In this work, we model\nphase-dependent thermal emission spectra of the archetype ultra-hot Jupiter\nWASP-76b to understand how the line strengths and Doppler shifts of Fe, CO,\nH$_2$O, and OH evolve throughout the orbit. We post-process outputs of the\nSPARC/MITgcm global circulation model with the 3D Monte-Carlo radiative\ntransfer code gCMCRT to simulate emission spectra at 36 orbital phases. We then\ncross-correlate the spectra with different templates to obtain CCF and\n$K_{\\text{p}}$$-$$V_{\\text{sys}}$ maps. For each species, our models produce\nconsistently negative $K_{\\text{p}}$ offsets in pre- and post-eclipse, which\nare driven by planet rotation. The size of these offsets is similar to the\nequatorial rotation velocity of the planet. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the\nweak vertical temperature gradient on the nightside of ultra-hot Jupiters mutes\nthe absorption features of CO and H$_2$O, which significantly hampers their\ndetectability in pre- and post-transit. We also show that the $K_{\\text{p}}$\nand $V_{\\text{sys}}$ offsets in pre- and post-transit are not always a measure\nfor the line-of-sight velocities in the atmosphere. This is because the\ncross-correlation signal is a blend of dayside emission and nightside\nabsorption features. Finally, we highlight that the observational uncertainty\nin the known orbital velocity of ultra-hot Jupiters can be multiple km/s, which\nmakes it hard for certain targets to meaningfully report absolute\n$K_{\\text{p}}$ offsets.",

Since the Hubble\nconstant that best fits observations of these supernovae often turns out to be\nhigh compared to fits to other data, they are currently being investigated for\npossible systematic effects, with many studies focusing on the calibration of\nthe distance ladder in the local Universe. Here we present a simulation-based\nassessment of another type of systematic effect, related to the chance that the\nline of sight to a distant supernova passes close to a foreground galaxy. We\nconsider two cases separately: First, the foreground galaxy may block the line\nof sight so that the supernova is not observed. Since foreground galaxies are\ncorrelated with overdensities that typically magnify the flux of background\nsources, this effect leads to a systematic removal of lensed supernovae from\nthe sample, biasing the high-redshift Hubble diagram towards demagnified\n(fainter) supernovae. Second, if the supernova can be observed, its proximity\nto the foreground galaxy can lead to an incorrect host assignment, especially\nif the true host has a low surface brightness. Since foreground galaxies are\ntypically found at lower redshifts, this effect introduces another systematic\nbias. The probability of line-of-sight alignments with foreground galaxies\nincreases with redshift and therefore affects distant supernovae more strongly.\nWe find that both effects are small, but the effect of host misidentification\nshould be included in the systematic error budget at current levels of\nmeasurement precision.",

Conventional\ntreatment planning relies on multiple energy layers, extending delivery time\ndue to slow layer switching. We propose to use pin ridge filters (pRFs),\ninitially developed for FLASH radiotherapy, to construct a single energy beam\nplan and minimize dose delivery time. The conventional ITV--based\nfree--breathing treatment plan served as the reference. A GTV--based IMPT--DS\nplan with a downstream energy modulation strategy was developed based on a new\nbeam model that was commissioned using the maximum energy of the IMPT plan.\nConsequently, a nested iterative pencil beam direction (PBD) spot reduction\nprocess removed low--weighted spots along each PBD, generating pRFs with\ncoarser resolution. Finally, the IMPT--DS plan was then converted into an\nIMPT--pRF plan, using a monoenergetic beam with optimized spot positions and\nweights. This approach was validated on lung and liver SBRT cases (10 Gy RBE x\n5). For the lung case, the mean lung--GTV dose decreased from 10.3 Gy to 6.9\nGy, with delivery time reduced from 188.79 to 36.16 seconds. The largest time\nreduction was at 150{\\deg}, from 47.4 to 3.99 seconds. For the liver case, the\nmean liver--GTV dose decreased from 5.7 Gy to 3.8 Gy, with delivery time\nreduced from 111.13 to 30.54 seconds. The largest time reduction was at\n180{\\deg}, from 38.57 to 3.94 seconds. This method significantly reduces dose\ndelivery time and organ at risk dose.

Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning outputs uncovers\nnew kinds of failures. DeepSeek R1, for instance, often concedes with \"I give\nup\" before providing an answer that it knows is wrong. R1 can also be\nremarkably \"uncertain\" in its output and in rare cases, it does not \"finish\nthinking,\" which suggests the need for techniques to \"wrap up\" before the\ncontext window limit is reached. We also quantify the effectiveness of\nreasoning longer to identify the point beyond which more reasoning is unlikely\nto improve accuracy on our benchmark.",

In this paper, we focus on recovering the subspace spanned by the\nsignals via spectral estimators -- a family of methods routinely used in\npractice, often as a warm-start for iterative algorithms. Our main technical\ncontribution is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of\nspectral methods, when sample size and input dimension grow proportionally and\nthe dimension $p$ of the space to recover is fixed. Specifically, we locate the\ntop-$p$ eigenvalues of the spectral matrix and establish the overlaps between\nthe corresponding eigenvectors (which give the spectral estimators) and a basis\nof the signal subspace. Our analysis unveils a phase transition phenomenon in\nwhich, as the sample complexity grows, eigenvalues escape from the bulk of the\nspectrum and, when that happens, eigenvectors recover directions of the desired\nsubspace. The precise characterization we put forward enables the optimization\nof the data preprocessing, thus allowing to identify the spectral estimator\nthat requires the minimal sample size for weak recovery.",

Existing\nmethods seek to mitigate these risks by applying constrained adversarial\nfine-tuning to CLIP vision encoders on ImageNet-scale data, ensuring their\ngeneralization ability is preserved. However, this limited adversarial training\nrestricts robustness and broader generalization. In this work, we explore an\nalternative approach of leveraging existing vision classification models that\nhave been adversarially pre-trained on large-scale data.

Through systematic evaluation across visual\nquestion-answering, image captioning, and jail-break attacks, we demonstrate\nthat MLLMs trained with these robust models achieve superior adversarial\nrobustness while maintaining favorable clean performance.

A key step toward this goal is estimating Heterogeneous Treatment\nEffects (HTE) - the way treatments impact different subgroups. While crucial,\nHTE estimation is challenging with survival data, where time until an event\n(e.g., death) is key. Existing methods often assume complete observation, an\nassumption violated in survival data due to right-censoring, leading to bias\nand inefficiency. Cui et al. (2023) proposed a doubly-robust method for HTE\nestimation in survival data under no hidden confounders, combining a causal\nsurvival forest with an augmented inverse-censoring weighting estimator.\nHowever, we find it struggles under heavy censoring, which is common in\nrare-outcome problems such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover,\nmost current methods cannot handle instrumental variables, which are a crucial\ntool in the causal inference arsenal. We introduce Multiple Imputation for\nSurvival Treatment Response (MISTR), a novel, general, and non-parametric\nmethod for estimating HTE in survival data. MISTR uses recursively imputed\nsurvival trees to handle censoring without directly modeling the censoring\nmechanism. Through extensive simulations and analysis of two real-world\ndatasets-the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 175 and the Illinois\nunemployment dataset we show that MISTR outperforms prior methods under heavy\ncensoring in the no-hidden-confounders setting, and extends to the instrumental\nvariable setting.

Anthropological\nevidence suggests that the earliest forms of some writing systems originally\nconsisted of iconic pictographs, which signify their referent via visual\nresemblance. While previous studies have examined the emergence and,\nseparately, the evolution of pictographic systems through a computational lens,\nmost employ non-naturalistic methodologies that make it difficult to draw clear\nanalogies to human and animal cognition. We develop a multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning testbed for emergent communication called a Signification Game, and\nformulate a model of inferential communication that enables agents to leverage\nvisual theory of mind to communicate actions using pictographs. Our model,\nwhich is situated within a broader formalism for animal communication, sheds\nlight on the cognitive and cultural processes underlying the emergence of\nproto-writing.",

Training employs a\ndual-rate optimization process within the classical variational Bayes\nframework: fast learning of local variational parameters for the posterior\ndistribution of latent vectors (inference-time computation), and slow learning\nof global decoder parameters. Empirical studies reveal that LTMs possess\nadditional scaling dimensions beyond traditional Large Language Models (LLMs),\nsuch as the number of iterations in inference-time computation and number of\nlatent thought vectors. Higher sample efficiency can be achieved by increasing\ntraining compute per token, with further gains possible by trading model size\nfor more inference steps. Designed based on these scaling properties, LTMs\ndemonstrate superior sample and parameter efficiency compared to autoregressive\nmodels and discrete diffusion models.

Furthermore, we advocate using\nOriented Ellipses (OEs) to represent oriented objects, which relates to GauCho\nthrough a bijective function and alleviates the encoding ambiguity problem for\ncircular objects.

Current LLM agents, particularly those\nbased on proprietary language models, typically rely on prompts to incorporate\nknowledge about the target tasks. This approach does not allow the agent to\ninternalize this information and instead relies on ever-expanding prompts to\nsustain its functionality in diverse scenarios.

Our approach\nemploys an iterative process where the agent collects new experiences, receives\ncorrective feedback from humans in the form of hints, and integrates this\nfeedback into its weights via a context distillation training procedure.

While previous studies underscore that building a core fan community\nis essential to a streamer's success, we lack an understanding of the\ncharacteristics of viewers of this new type of streamer. Gaining a deeper\ninsight into these viewers is critical for VTubers to enhance audience\nengagement, foster a more robust fan base, and attract a larger viewership. To\naddress this gap, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of VTuber viewers on\nBilibili, a leading livestreaming platform where nearly all VTubers in China\nstream. By compiling a first-of-its-kind dataset covering 2.7M livestreaming\nsessions, we investigate the characteristics, engagement patterns, and\ninfluence of VTuber viewers. Our research yields several valuable insights,\nwhich we then leverage to develop a tool to \"recommend\" future subscribers to\nVTubers. By reversing the typical approach of recommending streams to viewers,\nthis tool assists VTubers in pinpointing potential future fans to pay more\nattention to, and thereby effectively growing their fan community.",

    "abstract": "Local certification is a topic originating from distributed computing, where\na prover tries to convince the vertices of a graph $G$ that $G$ satisfies some\nproperty $\\mathcal{P}$. To convince the vertices, the prover gives a small\npiece of information, called certificate, to each vertex, and the vertices then\ndecide whether the property $\\mathcal{P}$ is satisfied by just looking at their\ncertificate and the certificates of their neighbors. When studying a property\n$\\mathcal{P}$ in the perspective of local certification, the aim is to find the\noptimal size of the certificates needed to certify $\\mathcal{P}$, which can be\nviewed a measure of the local complexity of $\\mathcal{P}$.\n  A certification scheme is considered to be efficient if the size of the\ncertificates is polylogarithmic in the number of vertices. While there have\nbeen a number of meta-theorems providing efficient certification schemes for\ngeneral graph classes, the proofs of the lower bounds on the size of the\ncertificates are usually very problem-dependent.\n  In this work, we introduce a notion of hardness reduction in local\ncertification, and show that we can transfer a lower bound on the certificates\nfor a property $\\mathcal{P}$ to a lower bound for another property\n$\\mathcal{P}'$, via a (local) hardness reduction from $\\mathcal{P}$ to\n$\\mathcal{P}'$. We then give a number of applications in which we obtain\npolynomial lower bounds for many classical properties using such reductions.",

This study focuses on the development of automated classifiers for a\nlarge telemetry dataset comprising detections from fifty acoustically tagged\ndusky kob monitored in the Breede Estuary, South Africa. Using an array of 16\nacoustic receivers deployed throughout the estuary between 2016 and 2021, we\ncollected over three million individual data points. We present detailed\nguidelines for data pre-processing, resampling strategies, labelling process,\nfeature engineering, data splitting methodologies, and the selection and\ninterpretation of machine learning and deep learning models for anomaly\ndetection. Among the evaluated models, neural networks autoencoder (NN-AE)\ndemonstrated superior performance, aided by our proposed threshold-finding\nalgorithm. NN-AE achieved a high recall with no false normal (i.e., no\nmisclassifications of anomalous movements as normal patterns), a critical\nfactor in ensuring that no true anomalies are overlooked. In contrast, other\nmodels exhibited false normal fractions exceeding 0.9, indicating they failed\nto detect the majority of true anomalies; a significant limitation for\ntelemetry studies where undetected anomalies can distort interpretations of\nmovement patterns.

The observed solenoid effect, as well as others, shows that a particle\nis affected by the potential in a region in which there is no force-field.

Its interpretation is\ndebated between a physical significance of the potential versus non-locality of\nquantum physics with the presence of the force-field generated by the potential\ndifference outside this region. We demonstrate that the debate is resolved with\nthe idea of replacing spatial interference by flavour interferometry as\nobserved in neutrino oscillations. The neutrino propagation through the crust\nof the Earth in current facilities is affected by a constant scalar matter\npotential and the phase difference is in flavour internal properties. Here we\nshow how to signal and experimentally disentangle the phase-shift due to the\npotential by means of observables characteristic of its symmetry properties.\nThe energy dependence of the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry in the golden\ntransition $\\nu_\\mu \\rightarrow \\nu_e$ allows a clear separation of the matter\ncomponent against the genuine asymmetry in the absence of the potential.

To train VisTA, we used a constructed reference dataset\ncontaining images, abnormality types, and descriptions verified by medical\nexperts. VisTA produces four outputs: predicted abnormality type, similarity to\nreference cases, evidence-driven explanation, and final AD diagnoses. To\nillustrate VisTA's efficacy, we reported accuracy metrics for abnormality\nretrieval and dementia prediction. To demonstrate VisTA's explainability, we\ncompared its explanations with human experts' explanations.\n  Results: Compared to 15 million images used for baseline pretraining, VisTA\nonly used 170 samples for fine-tuning and obtained significant improvement in\nabnormality retrieval and dementia prediction.

These self-growing building blocks can be assembled into a wide range\nof structures. Diazotrophic cyanobacteria will 1) fix carbon dioxide and\ndinitrogen from the atmosphere and convert them into oxygen and organic carbon\nand nitrogen sources to support filamentous fungi; and 2) give rise to high\nconcentrations of carbonate ions because of photosynthetic activities.\nFilamentous fungi will 1) bind metal ions onto fungal cell walls and serve as\nnucleation sites to promote biomineral precipitates; and 2) assist the survival\nand growth of cyanobacteria by providing them water, minerals, additional\ncarbon dioxide, and protection. This report presents the major progress of the\nproject. It has been tested and confirmed that such co-culture systems can be\ncreated, and they grow very well solely on Martian regolith simulants, air,\nlight, and an inorganic liquid medium without any additional carbon or nitrogen\nsources.

For district installations, the projected lifespan may\nextend one or two decades. The reliance on a single-year forecast, combined\nwith a fixed load growth rate, is the current industry standard, but does not\nsupport a multi-decade investment. Existing work on long-term forecasting\nfocuses on annual growth rate and/or uses time resolution that is coarser than\nhourly. To address the gap, we propose multiple statistical forecast models,\nverified over as long as an 11-year horizon. Combining demand data, weather\ndata, and occupancy trends results in a hybrid statistical model, i.e.,\ngeneralized additive model (GAM) with a seasonal autoregressive integrated\nmoving average (SARIMA) of the GAM residuals, a multiple linear regression\n(MLR) model, and a GAM with ARIMA errors model. We evaluate accuracy based on:\n(i) annual growth rates of monthly peak loads; (ii) annual growth rates of\noverall energy consumption; (iii) preservation of daily, weekly, and\nmonth-to-month trends that occur within each year, known as the 'seasonality'\nof the data; and, (iv) realistic representation of demand for a full range of\nweather and occupancy conditions. For example, the models yield an 11-year\nforecast from a one-year training data set with a normalized root mean square\nerror of 9.091%, a six-year forecast from a one-year training data set with a\nnormalized root mean square error of 8.949%, and a one-year forecast from a\n1.2-year training data set with a normalized root mean square error of 6.765%.",

    "abstract": "Although web advertisements represent an inimitable part of digital cultural\nheritage, serious archiving and replay challenges persist. To explore these\nchallenges, we created a dataset of 279 archived ads. We encountered five\nproblems in archiving and replaying them. For one, prior to August 2023,\nInternet Archive's Save Page Now service excluded not only well-known ad\nservices' ads, but also URLs with ad related file and directory names. Although\nafter August 2023, Save Page Now still blocked the archiving of ads loaded on a\nweb page, it permitted the archiving of an ad's resources if the user directly\narchived the URL(s) associated with the ad. Second, Brozzler's incompatibility\nwith Chrome prevented ads from being archived. Third, during crawling and\nreplay sessions, Google's and Amazon's ad scripts generated URLs with different\nrandom values. This precluded archived ads' replay. Updating replay systems'\nfuzzy matching approach should enable the replay of these ads. Fourth, when\nloading Flashtalking web page ads outside of ad iframes, the ad script\nrequested a non-existent URL. This, prevented the replay of ad resources. But\nas was the case with Google and Amazon ads, updating replay systems' fuzzy\nmatching approach should enable Flashtalking ads' replay. Finally, successful\nreplay of ads loaded in iframes with the src attribute of \"about:blank\"\ndepended upon a given browser's service worker implementation. A Chromium bug\nstopped service workers from accessing resources inside of this type of iframe,\nwhich in turn prevented replay. Replacing the \"about:blank\" value for the\niframe's src attribute with a blob URL before an ad was loaded solved this\nproblem. Resolving these replay problems will improve the replay of ads and\nother dynamically loaded embedded web resources that use random values or\n\"about:blank\" iframes.",

    "abstract": "The integration of vision-language modalities has been a significant focus in\nmultimodal learning, traditionally relying on Vision-Language Pretrained\nModels. However, with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has\nbeen a notable shift towards incorporating LLMs with vision modalities.\nFollowing this, the training paradigms for incorporating vision modalities into\nLLMs have evolved. Initially, the approach was to integrate the modalities\nthrough pretraining the modality integrator, named Single-stage Tuning. It has\nsince branched out into methods focusing on performance enhancement, denoted as\nTwo-stage Tuning, and those prioritizing parameter efficiency, referred to as\nDirect Adaptation. However, existing surveys primarily address the latest\nVision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with Two-stage Tuning, leaving a gap in\nunderstanding the evolution of training paradigms and their unique\nparameter-efficient considerations. This paper categorizes and reviews 34 VLLMs\nfrom top conferences, journals, and highly cited Arxiv papers, focusing on\nparameter efficiency during adaptation from the training paradigm perspective.\nWe first introduce the architecture of LLMs and parameter-efficient learning\nmethods, followed by a discussion on vision encoders and a comprehensive\ntaxonomy of modality integrators. We then review three training paradigms and\ntheir efficiency considerations, summarizing benchmarks in the VLLM field. To\ngain deeper insights into their effectiveness in parameter efficiency, we\ncompare and discuss the experimental results of representative models, among\nwhich the experiment of the Direct Adaptation paradigm is replicated. Providing\ninsights into recent developments and practical uses, this survey is a vital\nguide for researchers and practitioners navigating the efficient integration of\nvision modalities into LLMs.",

To address this\nfundamental challenge, we propose Conditional Ambiguous Question-Answering\n(CondAmbigQA), a benchmark comprising 2,000 ambiguous queries and\ncondition-aware evaluation metrics. Our study pioneers \"conditions\" as explicit\ncontextual constraints that resolve ambiguities in QA tasks through\nretrieval-based annotation, where retrieved Wikipedia fragments help identify\npossible interpretations for a given query and annotate answers accordingly.\nExperiments demonstrate that models considering conditions before answering\nimprove answer accuracy by 11.75%, with an additional 7.15% gain when\nconditions are explicitly provided. These results highlight that apparent\nhallucinations may stem from inherent query ambiguity rather than model\nfailure, and demonstrate the effectiveness of condition reasoning in QA,\nproviding researchers with tools for rigorous evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Generative diffusion models trained on large-scale datasets have achieved\nremarkable progress in image synthesis. In favor of their ability to supplement\nmissing details and generate aesthetically pleasing contents, recent works have\napplied them to image deblurring via training an adapter on blurry-sharp image\npairs to provide structural conditions for restoration. However, acquiring\nsubstantial amounts of realistic paired data is challenging and costly in\nreal-world scenarios. On the other hand, relying solely on synthetic data often\nresults in overfitting, leading to unsatisfactory performance when confronted\nwith unseen blur patterns. To tackle this issue, we propose UID-Diff, a\ngenerative-diffusion-based model designed to enhance deblurring performance on\nunknown domains by decoupling structural features and blur patterns through\njoint training on three specially designed tasks. We employ two Q-Formers as\nstructural features and blur patterns extractors separately. The features\nextracted by them will be used for the supervised deblurring task on synthetic\ndata and the unsupervised blur-transfer task by leveraging unpaired blurred\nimages from the target domain simultaneously. We further introduce a\nreconstruction task to make the structural features and blur patterns\ncomplementary. This blur-decoupled learning process enhances the generalization\ncapabilities of UID-Diff when encountering unknown blur patterns. Experiments\non real-world datasets demonstrate that UID-Diff outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods in blur removal and structural preservation in various\nchallenging scenarios.",

Ultimately, this will require both astute design decisions and\ntimely parameter adjustments to maintain stability that is challenging even\nwith expert human operators. While machine learning is widely investigated in\n3D printing, existing methods typically overlook spatial features that vary\nacross prints and thus find it difficult to produce desired geometries. Here,\nwe encode volumetric representations of printed parts into neural fields and\napply a new regularization strategy, based on minimizing the partial derivative\nof the field's output with respect to a single, non-learnable parameter. By\nthus encouraging small input changes to yield only small output variations, we\nencourage smooth interpolation between observed volumes and hence realistic\ngeometry predictions. This framework therefore allows the extraction of\n'imagined' 3D shapes, revealing how a part would look if manufactured under\npreviously unseen parameters. The resulting continuous field is used for\ndata-driven optimization to maximize geometric fidelity between expected and\nproduced geometries, reducing post-processing, material waste, and production\ncosts.

Our results indicate that precise prior knowledge\nof the planetary mass can be crucial for accurate atmospheric retrievals if\nclouds are present in the atmosphere.

    "abstract": "We examine the localization transition in a two-leg ladder model\nincorporating a slowly varying quasiperiodic distortion as an inter-leg hopping\nin different parametric regions. In our model, we have introduced a distortion\nthat is neither periodic (Bloch-type) nor random (Anderson-type) but instead\nhas a slowly varying pseudorandom pattern described by $\\Gamma_{n}= \\lambda\ncos(2 \\pi Q n^{\\nu})$, where $0<\\nu <1$. We have demonstrated that in the\nladder model at $0<\\nu <1$ limit, there is some point at which it is not\npossible to see a pure metal-insulator transition due to the presence of a\nsingle particle mobility edge (SPME) state. We have seen that, unlike the\none-dimensional AA model, where the slowly varying potential has been\nintroduced as an onsite potential term, the delocalized states are present\nbeyond the $ \\lambda=2t$ limit. Further analysis shows that a pure\nmetal-to-insulator transition occurs for $\\nu=1$ at $\\lambda=2t.$ We also\nstudied the scale-invariant nature of the mobility edge, which confirms its\nrobustness. The wave packet dynamics also validates the presence of the\nmobility edge. We have seen that for the point $\\nu < 1$ the wave packet\ndynamics goes through the transition: ballistic (delocalized) through\nnearly-ballistic (nearly delocalized) to superdiffusive (fractal) phase. In\ncontrast to $\\nu <1$, for $\\nu=1$ the dynamics goes through the transition:\nballistic (delocalized) through ordinary diffusive (critical) to localized\nphase.",

We use machine learning (ML) for\nfast interpolation across an existing large grid of hydrodynamic upper\natmosphere models, providing mass-loss rates for any planet inside the grid\nboundaries with superior accuracy compared to previously published\ninterpolation schemes. We consider an already available grid comprising about\n11000 hydrodynamic upper atmosphere models for training and generate an\nadditional grid of about 250 models for testing purposes. We develop the ML\ninterpolation scheme (dubbed \"atmospheric Mass Loss INquiry frameworK\"; MLink)\nusing a Dense Neural Network, further comparing the results with what was\nobtained employing classical approaches (e.g. linear interpolation and radial\nbasis function-based regression). Finally, we study the impact of the different\ninterpolation schemes on the evolution of a small sample of carefully selected\nsynthetic planets. MLink provides high-quality interpolation across the entire\nparameter space by significantly reducing both the number of points with large\ninterpolation errors and the maximum interpolation error compared to previously\navailable schemes. For most cases, evolutionary tracks computed employing MLink\nand classical schemes lead to comparable planetary parameters at\nGyr-timescales. However, particularly for planets close to the top edge of the\nradius gap, the difference between the predicted planetary radii at a given age\nof tracks obtained employing MLink and classical interpolation schemes can\nexceed the typical observational uncertainties.

Imaging parameters were modified to\nreduce cumulative exposure by reducing projections (by 25%, 50%, 75%) in FDK\nreconstruction, or lowering single frame exposure by 25%, 50%, 70 to 75%. Cone\nBeam Dose Index (CBDI) and weighted CBDI (CBDI_w) were measured in CTDI\nphantoms to correlate with Kair. Image quality was assessed quantitatively (HU\nlinearity, uniformity, low-contrast visibility, high-contrast resolution,\nspatial integrity) using Catphan604, and qualitatively via anthropomorphic\nphantoms.\n  Results: A linear relationship between Kair, CTDI, and CBDI_w was\nestablished. High-contrast resolution and spatial integrity were unaffected by\ndose reduction (R < 0.5), while low-contrast visibility strongly correlated\nwith exposure (R > 0.75). HU uniformity and linearity remained stable (<40 HU\ndeviation), except for LARGE PELVIS at <50% single-frame exposure. 80 to 50%\ndose reduction retained clinically acceptable image quality with minimal\nartifacts or noise.\n  Significance: CBCT protocols on TrueBeam linacs were optimized for dose\nreduction. The method enables easy implementation by radiotherapy physicists\nwithout diagnostic physics equipment or expertise.",

Furthermore,\nthese embeddings are typically trained generically and reused across various\nsynthesis models. In contrast, we explore an approach to learning text\nembeddings specifically tailored to the T2I synthesis network, trained in an\nend-to-end fashion. Further, we combine generative and contrastive training and\nuse two embeddings, one optimized to enhance the photo-realism of the generated\nimages, and the other seeking to capture text-to-image alignment. A\ncomprehensive set of experiments on three text-to-image benchmark datasets\n(Oxford-102, Caltech-UCSD, and MS-COCO) reveal that having two separate\nembeddings gives better results than using a shared one and that such an\napproach performs favourably in comparison with methods that use text\nrepresentations from a pre-trained text encoder trained using a discriminative\napproach.

    "abstract": "ReRAM-based accelerators exhibit enormous potential to increase computational\nefficiency for DNN inference tasks, delivering significant performance and\nenergy savings over traditional platforms. By incorporating adaptive\nscheduling, these accelerators dynamically adjust to DNN requirements,\noptimizing allocation of constrained hardware resources. However, ReRAM cells\nhave limited endurance cycles due to wear-out from multiple updates for each\ninference execution, which shortens the lifespan of ReRAM-based accelerators\nand presents a practical challenge in positioning them as alternatives to\nconventional platforms like TPUs. Addressing these endurance limitations is\nessential for making ReRAM-based solutions viable for long-term,\nhigh-performance DNN inference. To address the lifespan limitations of\nReRAM-based accelerators, we introduce Hamun, an approximate computing method\ndesigned to extend the lifespan of ReRAM-based accelerators through a range of\noptimizations. Hamun incorporates a novel mechanism that detects faulty cell\ndue to wear-out and retires them, avoiding in this way their otherwise adverse\nimpact on DNN accuracy. Moreover, Hamun extends the lifespan of ReRAM-based\naccelerators by adapting wear-leveling techniques across various abstraction\nlevels of the accelerator and implementing a batch execution scheme to maximize\nReRAM cell usage for multiple inferences. On average, evaluated on a set of\npopular DNNs, Hamun demonstrates an improvement in lifespan of 13.2x over a\nstate-of-the-art baseline. The main contributors to this improvement are the\nfault handling and batch execution schemes, which provide 4.6x and 2.6x\nlifespan improvements respectively.",

It is demonstrated that Newton's third law holds for\nany pair of cells of the kd-tree engaged in mutual interaction. However, for\nthe entire system a linear momentum is not conserved. As a result, there is an\nunphysical force that causes the center of mass to migrate. For example, for a\npair of neutron stars, the displacement of the system's center of mass is found\nto be comparable to the radii of the objects at times of a few tens of\nKeplerian revolutions. This displacement cannot be reduced by increasing the\nnumber of particles for values of the tree opening parameter greater than 0.2.\nFor smaller values, the time required for the calculation is significantly\nlonger.",

Specifically, it examines\nhow thermal misbalance, characterized by two distinct timescales directly\nlinked to the cooling and heating functions, influences the dispersion\nrelation. This investigation is a key approach for understanding non-adiabatic\neffects on the behaviour of these waves. Our findings reveal that the effect of\nthermal misbalance on fast sausage and kink modes, consistent with previous\nstudies on slabs, is small but slightly more pronounced than previously\nthought. The impact is smaller at long-wavelength limits but increases at\nshorter wavelengths, leading to higher damping rates. This minor effect on fast\nmodes occurs despite the complex interaction of thermal misbalance terms within\nthe dispersion relation, even at low-frequency limits defined by the\ncharacteristic timescales. Additionally, a very small amplification is\nobserved, indicating a suppressed damping state for the long-wavelength\nfundamental fast kink mode. In contrast, slow magnetoacoustic modes are\nsignificantly affected by thermal misbalance, with the cusp frequency shifting\nslightly to lower values, which is significant for smaller longitudinal\nwavenumbers. This thermal misbalance likely accounts for the substantial\nattenuation observed in the propagation of slow magnetoacoustic waves within\nthe solar atmosphere. The long-wavelength limit leads to an analytical\nexpression that accurately describes the frequency shifts in slow modes due to\nmisbalance, closely aligning with both numerical and observational results.",

If the electrical conductivity is anisotropic, the\nelectrical currents will flow preferentially in certain directions rather than\nothers, and a simple differential rotation will suffice to generate a magnetic\nfield. In a galaxy with spiral arms, it is reasonable to assume that the\nelectrical conductivity will be twice larger along the arms than in the\nperpendicular direction, suggesting the possibility of an anisotropic dynamo.\nHowever, a further geometrical criterion must be satisfied to obtain a dynamo\n(Plunian & Alboussi\\`ere 2022). It is given by $\\Omega' \\cdot\\sin p > 0$, where\n$p$ is the pitch angle of the spiral arms, with $p \\in[-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\n\\frac{\\pi}{2}]$, and $\\Omega'$ is the radial shear of the angular velocity.

Even the galaxy NGC 4622, which has both trailing and leading\narms, does not satisfy this dynamo condition either. This is confirmed by\nnumerical simulations of the induction equation.

Recent advancements in deep learning\nhave catalyzed the evolution of automated methods for identifying first-break.\nNevertheless, the complexity of seismic data acquisition and the requirement\nfor detailed, expert-driven labeling often result in outliers and potential\nmislabeling within manually labeled datasets. These issues can negatively\naffect the training of neural networks, necessitating algorithms that handle\noutliers or mislabeled data effectively. We introduce the Simultaneous Picking\nand Refinement (SPR) algorithm, designed to handle datasets plagued by outlier\nsamples or even noisy labels. Unlike conventional approaches that regard manual\npicks as ground truth, our method treats the true first-break as a latent\nvariable within a probabilistic model that includes a first-break labeling\nprior. SPR aims to uncover this variable, enabling dynamic adjustments and\nimproved accuracy across the dataset. This strategy mitigates the impact of\noutliers or inaccuracies in manual labels. Intra-site picking experiments and\ncross-site generalization experiments on publicly available data confirm our\nmethod's performance in identifying first-break and its generalization across\ndifferent sites. Additionally, our investigations into noisy signals and labels\nunderscore SPR's resilience to both types of noise and its capability to refine\nmisaligned manual annotations. Moreover, the flexibility of SPR, not being\nlimited to any single network architecture, enhances its adaptability across\nvarious deep learning-based picking methods. Focusing on learning from data\nthat may contain outliers or partial inaccuracies, SPR provides a robust\nsolution to some of the principal obstacles in automatic first-break picking.",

Although some approaches\nattempt to jointly optimize image fusion and downstream tasks, these efforts\noften lack direct guidance or interaction, serving only to assist with a\npredefined fusion loss. To address this, we propose an ``Unfolding Attribution\nAnalysis Fusion network'' (UAAFusion), using attribution analysis to tailor\nfused images more effectively for semantic segmentation, enhancing the\ninteraction between the fusion and segmentation. Specifically, we utilize\nattribution analysis techniques to explore the contributions of semantic\nregions in the source images to task discrimination. At the same time, our\nfusion algorithm incorporates more beneficial features from the source images,\nthereby allowing the segmentation to guide the fusion process. Our method\nconstructs a model-driven unfolding network that uses optimization objectives\nderived from attribution analysis, with an attribution fusion loss calculated\nfrom the current state of the segmentation network. We also develop a new\npathway function for attribution analysis, specifically tailored to the fusion\ntasks in our unfolding network. An attribution attention mechanism is\nintegrated at each network stage, allowing the fusion network to prioritize\nareas and pixels crucial for high-level recognition tasks. Additionally, to\nmitigate the information loss in traditional unfolding networks, a memory\naugmentation module is incorporated into our network to improve the information\nflow across various network layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate our\nmethod's superiority in image fusion and applicability to semantic\nsegmentation.",

In this Letter, exploiting some peculiar but\nexperimentally feasible dynamical features of a collection of spins with\nall-to-all time-periodic interactions, we propose a metrology protocol that can\ncircumvent all the three mentioned obstacles and yet still make good use of\ntime as a resource for metrology. Specifically, by mapping the dynamics of such\na periodically driven spin system to that of a paradigm of quantum chaos but\ntuned to some high-order quantum resonance, it is shown that a simple $SU(2)$\ncoherent state can, after evolving to highly entangled states in the ensuing\ndynamics, be dynamically brought back to the same initial coherent state. The\nassociated quantum Fisher information is found to exhibit quadratic scaling\nwith both the number of spins and the duration of the metrology protocol.

More specifically, we build saliency maps that exploit\nthe temporal coherence between consecutive frames in a video, promoting\nconsistency when objects appear in different frames. We apply our method in a\nwaste-sorting scenario, where we perform weakly supervised video segmentation\n(WSVS) by training an auxiliary classifier that distinguishes between videos\nrecorded before and after a human operator, who manually removes specific\nwastes from a conveyor belt. The saliency maps of this classifier identify\nmaterials to be removed, and we modify the classifier training to minimize\ndifferences between the saliency map of a central frame and those in adjacent\nframes, after having compensated object displacement. Experiments on a\nreal-world dataset demonstrate the benefits of integrating temporal coherence\ndirectly during the training phase of the classifier. Code and dataset are\navailable upon request.",

In the\nthermodynamic limit, the latter is dominated by the trivial (vacuum) anyon, so\nthat topological order is destroyed at any nonzero temperature. In contrast, in\na finite-size system, order survives up to a finite temperature, revealing a\nnontrivial scaling between temperature and size similar to that of the\none-dimensional classical Ising model. We confirm this scaling by computing the\nthermal average of several observables such as Wegner-Wilson loops and\ntopological mutual information.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the large electric field enhancement and tight spatial\nconfinement supported by the so-called epsilon near-zero (ENZ) mode has\nattracted significant attention for the realization of efficient nonlinear\noptical devices. Here, we experimentally demonstrate ENZ photonic gap antennas\n(PGAs), which consist of a dielectric pillar within which a thin slab of indium\ntin oxide (ITO) material is embedded. In ENZ PGAs, hybrid dielectric-ENZ modes\nemerge from strong coupling between the dielectric antenna modes and the ENZ\nbulk plasmon resonance. These hybrid modes efficiently couple to free space and\nallow for large enhancements of the incident electric field over nearly an\noctave bandwidth, without the stringent lateral nanofabrication requirements of\nconventional plasmonic or dielectric nanoantennas. To understand the modal\nfeatures, we probe the linear response of single ENZ PGAs with dark field\nscattering and interpret the results in terms of a simple coupled oscillator\nframework. Third harmonic generation (THG) is used to probe the ITO local\nfields and large enhancements are observed in the THG efficiency over a broad\nspectral range. Surprisingly, sharp peaks emerge on top of the nonlinear\nresponse, which were not predicted by full wave calculations. These peaks are\nattributed to the ENZ material's nonlocal response, which once included using a\nhydrodynamic model for the ITO permittivity improves the agreement of our\ncalculations for both the linear and nonlinear response. This proof of concept\ndemonstrates the potential of ENZ PGAs, which we have previously shown can\nsupport electric field enhancements of up to 100--200X, and the importance of\nincluding nonlocal effects when describing the response of thin ENZ layers.\nImportantly, inclusion of the ITO nonlocality leads to increases in the\npredicted field enhancement, as compared to the local calculation.",

A crucial part\nof a 2.5D stacked chip is a low-latency and high-throughput inter-chiplet\ninterconnect (ICI). Two major factors affecting the latency and throughput are\nthe topology of links between chiplets and the chiplet placement. In this work,\nwe present PlaceIT, a novel methodology to jointly optimize the ICI topology\nand the chiplet placement. While state-of-the-art methods optimize the chiplet\nplacement for a predetermined ICI topology, or they select one topology out of\na set of candidates, we generate a completely new topology for each placement.\nOur process of inferring placement-based ICI topologies connects chiplets that\nare in close proximity to each other, making it particularly attractive for\nchips with silicon bridges or passive silicon interposers with severely limited\nlink lengths. We provide an open-source implementation of our method that\noptimizes the placement of homogeneously or heterogeneously shaped chiplets and\nthe ICI topology connecting them for a user-defined mix of four different\ntraffic types. We evaluate our methodology using synthetic traffic and traces,\nand we compare our results to a 2D mesh baseline. PlaceIT reduces the latency\nof synthetic L1-to-L2 and L2-to-memory traffic, the two most important types\nfor cache coherency traffic, by up to 28% and 62%, respectively.

Traditional fluid mechanics\nmodels, based on the quasi-continuum assumption and near-equilibrium\napproximation, are insufficient to capture significant discrete effects and\nthermodynamic nonequilibrium effects (TNEs) as the Knudsen number increases. To\novercome these limitations, a discrete Boltzmann modeling and simulation\nmethod, rooted in kinetic and mean-field theories, has been developed. By\napplying Chapman-Enskog multiscale analysis, the essential kinetic moment\nrelations $\\bm{\\Phi}$ for characterizing second-order TNEs are determined.\nThese relations are invariants in coarse-grained physical modeling, providing a\nunique mesoscopic perspective for analyzing TNE behaviors. A discrete Boltzmann\nmodel, accurate to the second-order in the Knudsen number, is developed to\nenable multiscale simulations of 3D supersonic flows. As key TNE measures,\nnonlinear constitutive relations (NCRs), are theoretically derived for the 3D\ncase, offering a constitutive foundation for improving macroscopic fluid\nmodeling. The NCRs in three dimensions exhibit greater complexity than their\ntwo-dimensional counterparts. This complexity arises from increased degrees of\nfreedom, which introduce additional kinds of nonequilibrium driving forces,\nstronger coupling between these forces, and a significant increase in\nnonequilibrium components. At the macroscopic level, the model is validated\nthrough several classical test cases, ranging from 1D to 3D scenarios, from\nsubsonic to supersonic regimes. At the mesoscopic level, the model accurately\ncaptures typical TNEs, such as viscous stress and heat flux, around mesoscale\nstructures, across various scales and orders.

    "abstract": "Consistency models are a new family of generative models capable of producing\nhigh-quality samples in either a single step or multiple steps. Recently,\nconsistency models have demonstrated impressive performance, achieving results\non par with diffusion models in the pixel space. However, the success of\nscaling consistency training to large-scale datasets, particularly for\ntext-to-image and video generation tasks, is determined by performance in the\nlatent space. In this work, we analyze the statistical differences between\npixel and latent spaces, discovering that latent data often contains highly\nimpulsive outliers, which significantly degrade the performance of iCT in the\nlatent space. To address this, we replace Pseudo-Huber losses with Cauchy\nlosses, effectively mitigating the impact of outliers. Additionally, we\nintroduce a diffusion loss at early timesteps and employ optimal transport (OT)\ncoupling to further enhance performance. Lastly, we introduce the adaptive\nscaling-$c$ scheduler to manage the robust training process and adopt\nNon-scaling LayerNorm in the architecture to better capture the statistics of\nthe features and reduce outlier impact. With these strategies, we successfully\ntrain latent consistency models capable of high-quality sampling with one or\ntwo steps, significantly narrowing the performance gap between latent\nconsistency and diffusion models.

However, the efficient and automatic discovery\nof environment symmetries, in particular for decentralized partially observable\nMarkov decision processes, remains an open problem. Furthermore, environmental\nsymmetry breaking constitutes only one type of coordination failure, which\nmotivates the search for a more accessible and broader symmetry class. In this\npaper, we introduce such a broader group of previously unexplored symmetries,\nwhich we call expected return symmetries, which contains environment symmetries\nas a subgroup. We show that agents trained to be compatible under the group of\nexpected return symmetries achieve better zero-shot coordination results than\nthose using environment symmetries.

These tailored models are increasingly made\navailable through dedicated marketplaces, such as OpenAI's GPT Store. However,\ntheir black-box nature introduces significant safety and compliance risks. In\nthis work, we present a scalable framework for the automated evaluation of\nCustom GPTs against OpenAI's usage policies, which define the permissible\nbehaviors of these systems. Our framework integrates three core components: (1)\nautomated discovery and data collection of models from the GPT store, (2) a\nred-teaming prompt generator tailored to specific policy categories and the\ncharacteristics of each target GPT, and (3) an LLM-as-a-judge technique to\nanalyze each prompt-response pair for potential policy violations. We validate\nour framework with a manually annotated ground truth, and evaluate it through a\nlarge-scale study with 782 Custom GPTs across three categories: Romantic,\nCybersecurity, and Academic GPTs. Our manual annotation process achieved an F1\nscore of 0.975 in identifying policy violations, confirming the reliability of\nthe framework's assessments. The results reveal that 58.7% of the analyzed\nmodels exhibit indications of non-compliance, exposing weaknesses in the GPT\nstore's review and approval processes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that\na model's popularity does not correlate with compliance, and non-compliance\nissues largely stem from behaviors inherited from base models rather than\nuser-driven customizations.

However, in many real-world networks connections are not equal. One\nway to label edges as either strong or weak is to use strong triadic\nclosure~(STC). Here, if one node connects strongly with two other nodes, then\nthose two nodes should be connected at least with a weak edge. STC-labelings\nare not unique and finding the maximum number of strong edges is NP-hard. In\nthis paper, we apply STC to dense subgraph discovery. More formally, our score\nfor a given subgraph is the ratio between the sum of the number of strong edges\nand weak edges, weighted by a user parameter $\\lambda$, and the number of nodes\nof the subgraph. Our goal is to find a subgraph and an STC-labeling maximizing\nthe score. We show that for $\\lambda = 1$, our problem is equivalent to finding\nthe densest subgraph, while for $\\lambda = 0$, our problem is equivalent to\nfinding the largest clique, making our problem NP-hard.

    "abstract": "We derive a Debye-H\\\"uckel-like model of the electric ion-ion interaction for\nnon-constant dielectric susceptibility, which does not depend on any kind of\ncharging process due to its foundation in the general framework of\nnon-equilibrium electro-thermodynamics. The derivation, however, leads to a\nnovel thermodynamic consistency condition for the temperature dependence of the\nsusceptibility. Due to its contributions to the total pressure, the consistent\ncoupling of this new contribution to the free energy requires subtle\nmodifications in the derivation of the simple mixture model for electrolytes.\nThe coupled model is then applied to the apparent molar volume for various\nrelated monovalent salts over a wider range of salt concentrations and\ntemperatures, and classical tests of the electrolyte theory at phase boundaries\nare investigated.",

Additionally, we achieve\na reduced Toffoli depth (and consequently, T-depth), which is an extension of\nthe technique introduced by Khattar et al. (2024). In terms of a negative\nresult, we first show that using such conditionally clean ancilla techniques,\nToffoli depth can never achieve exactly $\\ceil{\\log_2 n}$, though it remains of\nthe same order. This highlights the limitation of the techniques exploiting\nconditionally clean ancilla [Nie et al., 2024, Khattar et al., 2024]. Then we\nprove that, in a more general setup, the T-Depth in the Clifford + T\ndecomposition, via Toffoli gates, is lower bounded by $\\ceil{\\log_2 n}$, and\nthis bound is achieved following the complete binary tree structure. Since the\n($2$-controlled) Toffoli gate can further be decomposed using Clifford $+$ T,\nvarious methodologies are explored too in this regard for trade-off related\nimplications.",

Furthermore, grouping a\nlarge number of suboptimal arms together albeit reduces the variance of the\nreward of the group, it may enhance the group mean to make it close to that\ncontaining the optimal arm.

The bimodal distribution in copper films is preserved during\nannealing, which leads to a shift of both peaks of the crystallite size\ndistribution histograms to the larger sizes region. In contrast to Cu,\nmicron-sized crystallites are present even in as-deposited Ag films besides the\nnanosized fraction.

To address this issue, we propose SPARC (Selective\nProgressive Attention ReCalibration), a training-free method that enhances the\ncontribution of visual tokens during decoding. SPARC is founded on three key\nobservations: (1) increasing the influence of all visual tokens reduces recall;\nthus, SPARC selectively amplifies visual tokens; (2) as captions lengthen,\nvisual attention becomes noisier, so SPARC identifies critical visual tokens by\nleveraging attention differences across time steps; (3) as visual attention\ngradually weakens, SPARC reinforces it to preserve its influence.

Most SB-related research\nfocuses on continuous data space $\\mathbb{R}^{D}$ and leaves open theoretical\nand algorithmic questions about applying SB methods to discrete data, e.g, on\nfinite spaces $\\mathbb{S}^{D}$. Notable examples of such sets $\\mathbb{S}$ are\ncodebooks of vector-quantized (VQ) representations of modern autoencoders,\ntokens in texts, categories of atoms in molecules, etc. In this paper, we\nprovide a theoretical and algorithmic foundation for solving SB in discrete\nspaces using the recently introduced Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF)\nprocedure. Specifically, we theoretically justify the convergence of\ndiscrete-time IMF (D-IMF) to SB in discrete spaces. This enables us to develop\na practical computational algorithm for SB, which we call Categorical\nSchr\\\"odinger Bridge Matching (CSBM).

To infuse visual information into this audio-only\nmodel, we extend it with an AV fusion module and LoRa adapters, one of the most\nup-to-date adapter approaches. One advantage of adapter-based approaches, is\nthat only a relatively small number of parameters are trained, while the basic\nmodel remains unchanged. Common AVSR approaches train single models to handle\nseveral noise categories and noise levels simultaneously. Taking advantage of\nthe lightweight nature of adapter approaches, we train noise-scenario-specific\nadapter-sets, each covering individual noise-categories or a specific\nnoise-level range. The most suitable adapter-set is selected by previously\nclassifying the noise-scenario. This enables our models to achieve an optimum\ncoverage across different noise-categories and noise-levels, while training\nonly a minimum number of parameters.\n  Compared to a full fine-tuning approach with SOTA performance our models\nachieve almost comparable results over the majority of the tested\nnoise-categories and noise-levels, with up to 88.5% less trainable parameters.\nOur approach can be extended by further noise-specific adapter-sets to cover\nadditional noise scenarios.

One of the key debates regarding its mechanism is whether it is\nseeded by a self-generated spectral component, such as the second harmonic,\nwhich is inevitably produced by the charge gradient in the laser plasma\nfilament. In this study, we generated both radially and azimuthally polarized\nN$_2^{+}$ lasing at 391 nm driven by a single 800-nm cylindrical vector beam.\nSubsequently, the same vector beam was employed to drive argon for the second\nharmonic generation. The radially polarized pump beam can produce radially\npolarized second harmonics with higher radial order, while the azimuthally\npolarized pump beam yields no second harmonic generation, owing to the special\nmechanism of the ponderomotive effect. The absence of azimuthally polarized\nsecond harmonic strongly ruled out the hypothesis of self-seeding by the second\nharmonic because radially and azimuthally polarized N$_2^{+}$ lasing signals\nshow comparable intensities. By characterizing the spatial phase distribution\nof the vector 391-nm lasing, we concluded that the phase of the 391-nm lasing\nis synchronized with the driving field. The experimental results suggest that\namplified spontaneous emissions are the origin of N$_2^+$ air lasing, which was\neffectively demonstrated by theoretical simulations.

To this end, we define a binary tree called label tree, where\neach leaf represents a rank and each non-leaf contains a single label, which is\nthen used to partition, and consequently, rank the nodes in the input graph.

Specifically, AdaSVD\nintroduces adaComp, which adaptively compensates for SVD truncation errors by\nalternately updating the singular matrices $\\mathcal{U}$ and\n$\\mathcal{V}^\\top$. Additionally, AdaSVD introduces adaCR, which adaptively\nassigns layer-specific compression ratios based on the relative importance of\neach layer. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM/VLM families and\nevaluation metrics demonstrate that AdaSVD consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) SVD-based methods, achieving superior performance with\nsignificantly reduced memory requirements. Code and models of AdaSVD will be\navailable at https://github.com/ZHITENGLI/AdaSVD.",

    "abstract": "We study fair vertex problem metatheorems on graphs within the scope of\nstructural parameterization in parameterized complexity. Unlike typical graph\nproblems that seek the smallest set of vertices satisfying certain properties,\nthe goal here is to find such a set that does not contain too many vertices in\nany neighborhood of any vertex. Formally, the task is to find a set $X\\subseteq\nV(G)$ of fair cost $k$, i.e., such that for all $v\\in V(G)$ $|X\\cap N(v)|\\le\nk$. Recently, Knop, Masa\\v{r}\\'ik, and Toufar [MFCS 2019] showed that all fair\nMSO$_1$ definable problems can be solved in FPT time parameterized by the twin\ncover of a graph. They asked whether such a statement would be achievable for a\nmore general parameterization of cluster vertex deletion, i.e., the smallest\nnumber of vertices required to be removed from the graph such that what remains\nis a collection of cliques.\n  In this paper, we prove that in full generality this is not possible by\ndemonstrating a W[1]-hardness. On the other hand, we give a sufficient property\nunder which a fair MSO$_1$ definable problem admits an FPT algorithm\nparameterized by the cluster vertex deletion number. Our algorithmic\nformulation is very general as it captures the fair variant of many natural\nvertex problems such as the Fair Feedback Vertex Set, the Fair Vertex Cover,\nthe Fair Dominating Set, the Fair Odd Cycle Transversal, as well as a connected\nvariant of thereof. Moreover, we solve the Fair $[\\sigma,\\rho]$-Domination\nproblem for $\\sigma$ finite, or $\\sigma=\\mathbb{N}$ and $\\rho$ cofinite.\nSpecifically, given finite or cofinite $\\rho\\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ and finite\n$\\sigma$, or $\\rho\\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ cofinite and $\\sigma=\\mathbb{N}$, the\ntask is to find set of vertices $X\\subseteq V(G)$ of fair cost at most $k$ such\nthat for all $v\\in X$, $|N(v)\\cap X|\\in\\sigma$ and for all $v\\in V(G)\\setminus\nX$, $|N(v)\\cap X|\\in\\rho$.",

To validate the universality of the observed fluctuation\nscaling, we study a complex directed polymer model with competing point and\ncolumnar disorder. Our results confirm that columnar disorder corresponds to\non-site energies in the Fock space from the random potentials, while point\ndisorder models the effects of random long-range interactions between the two\nparticles.

We demonstrate\nthat message-passing GNNs fundamentally fail to approximate sparse triangular\nfactorizations for classes of matrices for which high-quality preconditioners\nexist but require non-local dependencies. To illustrate this, we construct a\nset of baselines using both synthetic matrices and real-world examples from the\nSuiteSparse collection.

Our theoretical and empirical\nresults suggest that architectural innovations beyond message-passing are\nnecessary for applying GNNs to scientific computing tasks such as matrix\nfactorization.

To address these limitations, we\npropose TeLL-Drive, a hybrid framework that integrates a Teacher LLM to guide\nan attention-based Student DRL policy. By incorporating risk metrics,\nhistorical scenario retrieval, and domain heuristics into context-rich prompts,\nthe LLM produces high-level driving strategies through chain-of-thought\nreasoning. A self-attention mechanism then fuses these strategies with the DRL\nagent's exploration, accelerating policy convergence and boosting robustness\nacross diverse driving conditions. The experimental results, evaluated across\nmultiple traffic scenarios, show that TeLL-Drive outperforms existing baseline\nmethods, including other LLM-based approaches, in terms of success rates,\naverage returns, and real-time feasibility. Ablation studies underscore the\nimportance of each model component, especially the synergy between the\nattention mechanism and LLM-driven guidance.

However, their increasing impact on public opinion and information\ndissemination has made them a critical focus for security research due to\ninherent vulnerabilities. Previous studies have predominantly addressed attacks\ntargeting factual or single-query manipulations. In this paper, we address a\nmore practical scenario: topic-oriented adversarial opinion manipulation\nattacks on RAG models, where LLMs are required to reason and synthesize\nmultiple perspectives, rendering them particularly susceptible to systematic\nknowledge poisoning. Specifically, we propose Topic-FlipRAG, a two-stage\nmanipulation attack pipeline that strategically crafts adversarial\nperturbations to influence opinions across related queries. This approach\ncombines traditional adversarial ranking attack techniques and leverages the\nextensive internal relevant knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to\nexecute semantic-level perturbations. Experiments show that the proposed\nattacks effectively shift the opinion of the model's outputs on specific\ntopics, significantly impacting user information perception. Current mitigation\nmethods cannot effectively defend against such attacks, highlighting the\nnecessity for enhanced safeguards for RAG systems, and offering crucial\ninsights for LLM security research.",

In this work, we\nanalyze the representations of backdoor-poisoned samples learned by CLIP models\nand find that they exhibit unique characteristics in their local subspace,\ni.e., their local neighborhoods are far more sparse than that of clean samples.\nBased on this finding, we conduct a systematic study on detecting CLIP backdoor\nattacks and show that these attacks can be easily and efficiently detected by\ntraditional density ratio-based local outlier detectors, whereas existing\nbackdoor sample detection methods fail. Our experiments also reveal that an\nunintentional backdoor already exists in the original CC3M dataset and has been\ntrained into a popular open-source model released by OpenCLIP.

We propose a new\nelectrode placement algorithm, HingePlace, that utilizes a symmetrized hinge\nloss to harness the thresholding behavior of neural response. We extensively\ncompare the HingePlace algorithm with traditional electrode placement\nalgorithms in two simulation platforms.

    "abstract": "All-electric-controlled nonvolatile spin field-effect transistors (SFETs)\nbased on two-dimensional (2D) multiferroic van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures\nhold great promise for advanced spintronics applications. However, their\nperformance is hindered by the limited availability of 2D magnetic materials\nthat can switch effectively between metallic and semiconducting states with\nsizable bandgaps controlled by ferroelectric polarization. Most studies have\nfocused on materials that are naturally semiconducting, achieving a metallic\nstate by modifying the ferroelectric polarization. In this work, we introduce\nan innovative approach that uses interface effects to convert inherently\nmetallic 2D magnetic materials into half-metals and induce half-semiconducting\nbehavior through changes in ferroelectric polarization. Density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations on the CrPS3/Sc2CO2 heterostructure demonstrate that\nthe ferroelectric polarization of Sc2CO2 monolayers can adjust the electronic\nstructure of CrPS3, enabling a switch from half-metallic to half-semiconducting\nstates. Building on these insights, we designed a nonvolatile SFET and analyzed\nits transport properties using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF)\nmethod combined with DFT. Our results show that reversing the ferroelectric\npolarization achieves an on/off current ratio exceeding 5000000%, and the\nheterostructure generates nearly 100% spin-polarized current with a current\ndensity of up to 6500 {\\mu}A/{\\mu}m at bias voltage below 0.2 V. These findings\nhighlight a promising pathway for developing high-performance SFETs that\nsurpass existing 2D heterojunction materials.",

    "abstract": "A transiting planet was recently discovered around a star in the Taurus\nstar-forming region, IRAS 04125+2902, making it one of the youngest known\nplanets. The discovery paper cited two age estimates for IRAS 04125+2902, one\nbased on a comparison to two sets of model isochrones in the\nHertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram and a second age reported by an earlier study\nfor a putative population in Taurus that includes IRAS 04125+2902 (D4-North).\nHowever, the model isochrones in question differ significantly for most\ntemperatures and luminosities of young low-mass stars, and do not reproduce the\nobserved sequences for the TW Hya and 32 Ori associations (10 and 21 Myr).\nMeanwhile, as found in my previous work, D4-North is a collection of field\nstars and fragments of several distinct Taurus groups and older associations,\nso its quoted age is not meaningful. The true parent population for IRAS\n04125+2902 is a small group that is ~35 pc behind the L1495 and B209 clouds\n(B209N). I have analyzed the age of B209N through a comparison to TW Hya and 32\nOri. The M star sequences in the latter two associations have the same shapes,\nbut the sequence for B209N is flatter, indicating that >M4 stars at ages of <10\nMyr fade more quickly than stars at earlier types and older ages. For the one\nmember of B209N that is earlier than M4 (IRAS 04125+2902), I estimate an age of\n3.0+/-0.4 Myr based on its offsets from TW Hya and 32 Ori, which by\nhappenstance is similar to the value derived through the comparison to model\nisochrones.",

The chromospheric Ca II K\npolar network index (PNI; the fractional area of the chromospheric network\nregions above a certain latitude) has recently emerged as a reliable proxy for\npolar magnetic fields. In this study, we derive PNI estimates from newly\ncalibrated, rotation-corrected Ca II K observations from the Kodaikanal Solar\nObservatory (1904-2007) and modern data from the Rome Precision Solar\nPhotometric Telescope (2000-2022). We use both of those Ca II K archives to\nidentify polar network regions with an automatic adaptive threshold\nsegmentation technique and calculate the PNI. The PNI obtained from both the\narchives shows a significant correlation with the measured polar field from WSO\n(Pearson correlation coefficient r > 0.93) and the derived polar field based on\nan Advective Flux Transport Model (r > 0.91). The PNI series also shows a\nsignificant correlation with faculae counts derived from Mount Wilson\nObservatory observations (r > 0.87) for both KoSO and Rome-PSPT data. Finally,\nwe use the PNI series from both archives to reconstruct the polar magnetic\nfield over a 119-year-long period, which includes last 11 solar cycles (Cycle\n14-24). We also obtain a relationship between the amplitude of solar cycles (in\n13-month smoothed sunspot number) and the strength of the reconstructed polar\nfield at the preceding solar cycle minimum to validate the prediction of the\nongoing solar cycle, Cycle 25.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical modelling of coupled flow systems containing a free-flow region\nin contact with a porous medium is challenging, especially for arbitrary flow\ndirections to the fluid--porous interface. Transport processes in the free flow\nand porous medium are typically described by distinct equations: the Stokes\nequations and Darcy's law, respectively, with an appropriate set of coupling\nconditions at the common interface. Classical interface conditions based on the\nBeavers--Joseph condition are not accurate for general flows. Several\ngeneralisations are recently developed for arbitrary flows at the interface,\nsome of them are however only theoretically formulated and still need to be\nvalidated.\n  In this manuscript, we propose an alternative to couple free flow and\nporous-medium flow, namely, the hybrid-dimensional Stokes--Brinkman--Darcy\nmodel. Such formulation incorporates the averaged Brinkman equations within a\ncomplex interface between the free-flow and porous-medium regions. The complex\ninterface acts as a buffer zone facilitating storage and transport of mass and\nmomentum and the model is applicable for arbitrary flow directions. We validate\nthe proposed hybrid-dimensional model against the pore-scale resolved model in\nmultiple examples and compare numerical simulation results also with the\nclassical and generalised coupling conditions from the literature. The proposed\nhybrid-dimensional model demonstrates its applicability to describe arbitrary\ncoupled flows and shows its advantages in comparison to other generalised\ncoupling conditions.",

This sequence is\nobtained by replacing parts of the potential $U$ by its Moreau envelopes.\nSampling is performed in an Annealed Langevin type procedure, that is,\nsequentially sampling from $\\pi^{t_k}$ for decreasing $k$, effectively guiding\nthe samples from a simple starting density to the more complex target. In\naddition to a theoretical analysis we show experimental results supporting the\nefficacy of the method in terms of increased convergence speed and\napplicability to multi-modal densities $\\pi$.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning on non-Euclidean domains is important for analyzing complex\ngeometric data that lacks common coordinate systems and familiar Euclidean\nproperties. A central challenge in this field is to define convolution on\ndomains, which inherently possess irregular and non-Euclidean structures. In\nthis work, we introduce Quasi-conformal Convolution (QCC), a novel framework\nfor defining convolution on Riemann surfaces using quasi-conformal theories.\nEach QCC operator is linked to a specific quasi-conformal mapping, enabling the\nadjustment of the convolution operation through manipulation of this mapping.\nBy utilizing trainable estimator modules that produce Quasi-conformal mappings,\nQCC facilitates adaptive and learnable convolution operators that can be\ndynamically adjusted according to the underlying data structured on Riemann\nsurfaces. QCC unifies a broad range of spatially defined convolutions,\nfacilitating the learning of tailored convolution operators on each underlying\nsurface optimized for specific tasks. Building on this foundation, we develop\nthe Quasi-Conformal Convolutional Neural Network (QCCNN) to address a variety\nof tasks related to geometric data. We validate the efficacy of QCCNN through\nthe classification of images defined on curvilinear Riemann surfaces,\ndemonstrating superior performance in this context.

This architecture is orchestrated by a central server that\naggregates the local models from the clients. This server may be trusted, but\nnot all nodes in the network. Then, differential privacy (DP) can be used to\nprivatize the global model by adding noise. However, this may affect\nconvergence across the rounds of the federated architecture, depending also on\nthe aggregation strategy employed. In this work, we aim to introduce the notion\nof metric-privacy to mitigate the impact of classical server side global-DP on\nthe convergence of the aggregated model. Metric-privacy is a relaxation of DP,\nsuitable for domains provided with a notion of distance. We apply it from the\nserver side by computing a distance for the difference between the local\nmodels. We compare our approach with standard DP by analyzing the impact on six\nclassical aggregation strategies. The proposed methodology is applied to an\nexample of medical imaging and different scenarios are simulated across\nhomogeneous and non-i.i.d clients. Finally, we introduce a novel client\ninference attack, where a semi-honest client tries to find whether another\nclient participated in the training and study how it can be mitigated using DP\nand metric-privacy. Our evaluation shows that metric-privacy can increase the\nperformance of the model compared to standard DP, while offering similar\nprotection against client inference attacks.",

    "abstract": "Aligning visual features with language embeddings is a key challenge in\nvision-language models (VLMs). The performance of such models hinges on having\na good connector that maps visual features generated by a vision encoder to a\nshared embedding space with the LLM while preserving semantic similarity.\nExisting connectors, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), often produce\nout-of-distribution or noisy inputs, leading to misalignment between the\nmodalities. In this work, we propose a novel vision-text alignment method,\nAlignVLM, that maps visual features to a weighted average of LLM text\nembeddings. Our approach leverages the linguistic priors encoded by the LLM to\nensure that visual features are mapped to regions of the space that the LLM can\neffectively interpret. AlignVLM is particularly effective for document\nunderstanding tasks, where scanned document images must be accurately mapped to\ntheir textual content. Our extensive experiments show that AlignVLM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to prior alignment methods. We provide\nfurther analysis demonstrating improved vision-text feature alignment and\nrobustness to noise.",

    "abstract": "Online social networks have dramatically altered the landscape of public\ndiscourse, creating both opportunities for enhanced civic participation and\nrisks of deepening social divisions. Prevalent approaches to studying online\npolarization have been limited by a methodological disconnect: mathematical\nmodels excel at formal analysis but lack linguistic realism, while language\nmodel-based simulations capture natural discourse but often sacrifice\nanalytical precision. This paper introduces an innovative computational\nframework that synthesizes these approaches by embedding formal opinion\ndynamics principles within LLM-based artificial agents, enabling both rigorous\nmathematical analysis and naturalistic social interactions. We validate our\nframework through comprehensive offline testing and experimental evaluation\nwith 122 human participants engaging in a controlled social network\nenvironment. The results demonstrate our ability to systematically investigate\npolarization mechanisms while preserving ecological validity. Our findings\nreveal how polarized environments shape user perceptions and behavior:\nparticipants exposed to polarized discussions showed markedly increased\nsensitivity to emotional content and group affiliations, while perceiving\nreduced uncertainty in the agents' positions. By combining mathematical\nprecision with natural language capabilities, our framework opens new avenues\nfor investigating social media phenomena through controlled experimentation.\nThis methodological advancement allows researchers to bridge the gap between\ntheoretical models and empirical observations, offering unprecedented\nopportunities to study the causal mechanisms underlying online opinion\ndynamics.",

    "abstract": "A temporal graph is a graph whose edges are available only at certain points\nin time. It is temporally connected if the nodes can reach each other by paths\nthat traverse the edges chronologically (temporal paths). In general, temporal\ngraphs do not always admit small subsets of edges that preserve connectivity\n(temporal spanners). In the case of temporal cliques, spanners of size $O(n\\log\nn)$ are guaranteed. The original proof by Casteigts et al. [ICALP 2019]\ncombines a number of techniques, one of which is dismountability. In a recent\nwork, Angrick et al. [ESA 2024] simplified the proof and showed, among other\nthings, that a one-sided version of dismountability can be used to replace the\nsecond part of the proof.\n  In this paper, we revisit the dismountability principle. We characterizing\nthe structure that a temporal clique has if it is not 1-hop dismountable, then\nnot {1,2}-hop dismountable, and finally not {1,2,3}-hop dismountable.\n  It turns out that if a clique is k-hop dismountable for any other k, then it\nmust also be {1,2,3}-hop dismountable. Interestingly, excluding only 1-hop and\n2-hop dismountability is already sufficient for reducing the spanner problem\nfrom cliques to bi-cliques. Put together with the strategy of Angrick et al.,\nthe entire $O(n \\log n)$ result can now be recovered using only\ndismountability. An interesting by-product of our analysis is that any minimal\ncounter-example to the existence of $4n$ spanners must satisfy the properties\nof non {1,2,3}-hop dismountable cliques.\n  In the second part, we discuss connections between dismountability and\npivotability. We show that recursively k-hop dismountable cliques are pivotable\n(and thus admits $2n$ spanners, whatever k). We define a family of labelings\n(called full-range) which force both dismountability and pivotability and that\ngives some evidence that large lifetimes could be exploited more generally.",

    "abstract": "To meet its dual burdens of providing useful statistics and ensuring privacy\nof individual respondents, the US Census Bureau has for decades introduced some\nform of \"noise\" into published statistics. Initially, they used a method known\nas \"swapping\" (1990-2010). In 2020, they switched to an algorithm called\nTopDown that ensures a form of Differential Privacy. While the TopDown\nalgorithm has been made public, no implementation of swapping has been released\nand many details of the deployed swapping methodology deployed have been kept\nsecret. Further, the Bureau has not published (even a synthetic) \"original\"\ndataset and its swapped version. It is therefore difficult to evaluate the\neffects of swapping, and to compare these effects to those of other privacy\ntechnologies. To address these difficulties we describe and implement a\nparameterized swapping algorithm based on Census publications, court documents,\nand informal interviews with Census employees. With this implementation, we\ncharacterize the impacts of swapping on a range of statistical quantities of\ninterest. We provide intuition for the types of shifts induced by swapping and\ncompare against those introduced by TopDown. We find that even when swapping\nand TopDown introduce errors of similar magnitude, the direction in which\nstatistics are biased need not be the same across the two techniques. More\nbroadly, our implementation provides researchers with the tools to analyze and\npotentially correct for the impacts of disclosure avoidance systems on the\nquantities they study.",

To\naddress these challenges, we present the design of a bespoke polyvinyl alcohol\n(PVA) derivative conjugated with both phenothiazine and methacrylate\nfunctionalities, enabling staining-free antibacterial photodynamic effects,\ncellular tolerability and processability into various wound dressing formats,\nincluding films, textile fibres and nanoscale coatings. Tosylation of PVA is\nleveraged for the covalent coupling of toluidine blue, as confirmed by UV-Vis\nspectroscopy and the minimal release of TB in vitro. UV-induced network\nformation is exploited to accomplish cast films and nanoscale integrated wound\ndressing coatings. UV curing is also successfully coupled with an in-house wet\nspinning process to realise individual, water-insoluble fibres as the building\nblocks of fibrous wound dressings. A fluorometric assay supports the generation\nof reactive oxygen species when the UV-cured samples are exposed to work, but\nnot UV, light, yielding a mean log10 reduction of up to 2.13 in S. aureus, and\nthe complete eradication of P. aeruginosa. Direct and extract cytotoxicity\ntests with UV-cured films and fibres demonstrate the viability of L929\nfibroblasts following 60-min light irradiation and 72-hour cell culture.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of strategic classification, where a learner must\nbuild a model to classify agents based on features that have been strategically\nmodified. Previous work in this area has concentrated on the case when the\nlearner is restricted to deterministic classifiers. In contrast, we perform a\ntheoretical analysis of an extension to this setting that allows the learner to\nproduce a randomised classifier. We show that, under certain conditions, the\noptimal randomised classifier can achieve better accuracy than the optimal\ndeterministic classifier, but under no conditions can it be worse. When a\nfinite set of training data is available, we show that the excess risk of\nStrategic Empirical Risk Minimisation over the class of randomised classifiers\nis bounded in a similar manner as the deterministic case. In both the\ndeterministic and randomised cases, the risk of the classifier produced by the\nlearner converges to that of the corresponding optimal classifier as the volume\nof available training data grows. Moreover, this convergence happens at the\nsame rate as in the i.i.d. case. Our findings are compared with previous\ntheoretical work analysing the problem of strategic classification. We conclude\nthat randomisation has the potential to alleviate some issues that could be\nfaced in practice without introducing any substantial downsides.",

Traditionally, travelers are assumed to use private cars,\nso road costs grow with the number of users due to congestion. However, in\nsustainable transit systems, travelers share vehicles s.t. more users on a road\nlead to higher sharing potential and reduced cost per user. Thus, we invert the\nusual avoidant traffic assignment (ATA) and instead consider synergistic\ntraffic assignment (STA) where road costs decrease with use.\n  We find that STA is significantly different from ATA from a game-theoretical\npoint of view. We show that a simple iterative best-response method with\nsimultaneous updates converges to an equilibrium state. This enables efficient\ncomputation of equilibria using optimized speedup techniques for shortest-path\nqueries. In contrast, ATA requires slower sequential updates or more\ncomplicated iteration schemes that only approximate an equilibrium. Experiments\nwith a realistic scenario for the city of Stuttgart indicate that STA indeed\nquickly converges to an equilibrium. We envision STA as a part of\nsoftware-defined transportation systems that dynamically adapt to current\ntravel demand. As a first demonstration, we show that an STA equilibrium can be\nused to incorporate traveler synergism in a simple bus line planning algorithm\nto potentially greatly reduce the required vehicle resources.",

In this work, we highlight the dependence of effective potential-based\nreward shaping on the initial Q-values and external rewards, which determine\nthe agent's ability to exploit the shaping rewards to guide its exploration and\nachieve increased sample efficiency. We formally derive how a simple linear\nshift of the potential function can be used to improve the effectiveness of\nreward shaping without changing the encoded preferences in the potential\nfunction, and without having to adjust the initial Q-values, which can be\nchallenging and undesirable in deep reinforcement learning. We show the\ntheoretical limitations of continuous potential functions for correctly\nassigning positive and negative reward shaping values.

We investigated whether listeners probabilistically adapt their\ncomprehension based on the likelihood of speakers producing\nstereotype-incongruent utterances. Our findings reveal two potential\nmechanisms: a speaker-general mechanism that adjusts overall expectations about\nspeaker-content relationships, and a speaker-specific mechanism that updates\nindividual speaker models. In two EEG experiments, participants heard speakers\nmake stereotype-congruent or incongruent utterances, with incongruency base\nrate manipulated between blocks. In Experiment 1, speaker incongruency\nmodulated both high-beta (21-30 Hz) and theta (4-6 Hz) oscillations:\nincongruent utterances decreased oscillatory power in low base rate condition\nbut increased it in high base rate condition. The theta effect varied with\nlisteners' openness trait: less open participants showed theta increases to\nspeaker-incongruencies, suggesting maintenance of speaker-specific information,\nwhile more open participants showed theta decreases, indicating flexible model\nupdating. In Experiment 2, we dissociated base rate from the target speaker by\nmanipulating the overall base rate using an alternative non-target speaker.\nOnly the high-beta effect persisted, showing power decrease for\nspeaker-incongruencies in low base rate condition but no effect in high base\nrate condition. The high-beta oscillations might reflect the speaker-general\nadjustment, while theta oscillations may index the speaker-specific model\nupdating. These findings provide evidence for how language processing is shaped\nby social cognition in real time.",

This is especially true in\nmodern scenarios such as Industry 5.0, in which the integration of data\nproduced by humans, smart devices, and production processes plays a crucial\nrole. However, the management, retrieval, and visualization of data from a KG\nusing formal query languages can be difficult for non-expert users due to their\ntechnical complexity, thus limiting their usage inside industrial environments.\nFor this reason, we introduce SparqLLM, a framework that utilizes a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution, to enhance the querying of\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs). SparqLLM executes the Extract, Transform, and Load\n(ETL) pipeline to construct KGs from raw data. It also features a natural\nlanguage interface powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable automatic\nSPARQL query generation. By integrating template-based methods as\nretrieved-context for the LLM, SparqLLM enhances query reliability and reduces\nsemantic errors, ensuring more accurate and efficient KG interactions.\nMoreover, to improve usability, the system incorporates a dynamic visualization\ndashboard that adapts to the structure of the retrieved data, presenting the\nquery results in an intuitive format.

One\nimportant consequence is that, at the Planck scale around \"many\" points in the\nmanifold, any solution to the Helmholtz equation $\\Delta\\varphi+\\varphi =0$ can\nbe approximated by high energy eigenfunctions. This property, sometimes called\ninverse localization, has useful applications to the study of the nodal sets of\neigenfunctions. Alas, the only manifold for which the local limits of a\nsequence of high energy eigenfunctions are rigorously known to be given by\nrandom waves is the flat torus $(\\mathbf{R}/\\mathbf{Z})^2$, which is certainly\nnot chaotic.\n  Our objective in this paper is to study the validity of this \"inverse\nlocalization\" property in the class of integrable billiards, exploiting the\nfact that integrable polygonal billiards are classified and that Birkhoff\nconjectured that ellipses are the only smooth integrable billiards. Our main\nresults show that, while there are infinitely many integrable polygons\nexhibiting good inverse localization properties, for \"most\" integrable polygons\nand ellipses, this property fails dramatically. We thus conclude that, in a\ngeneric integrable billiard, the local limits of Dirichlet and Neumann\neigenfunctions do not match random waves, as one might expect in view of\nBerry's conjecture.

    "abstract": "The availability of foundational models (FMs) pre-trained on large-scale data\nhas advanced the state-of-the-art in many computer vision tasks. While FMs have\ndemonstrated good zero-shot performance on many image classification tasks,\nthere is often scope for performance improvement by adapting the FM to the\ndownstream task. However, the data that is required for this adaptation\ntypically exists in silos across multiple entities (data owners) and cannot be\ncollated at a central location due to regulations and privacy concerns. At the\nsame time, a learning service provider (LSP) who owns the FM cannot share the\nmodel with the data owners due to proprietary reasons. In some cases, the data\nowners may not even have the resources to store such large FMs. Hence, there is\na need for algorithms to adapt the FM in a double-blind federated manner, i.e.,\nthe data owners do not know the FM or each other's data, and the LSP does not\nsee the data for the downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a framework for\ndouble-blind federated adaptation of FMs using fully homomorphic encryption\n(FHE). The proposed framework first decomposes the FM into a sequence of\nFHE-friendly blocks through knowledge distillation. The resulting FHE-friendly\nmodel is adapted for the downstream task via low-rank parallel adapters that\ncan be learned without backpropagation through the FM. Since the proposed\nframework requires the LSP to share intermediate representations with the data\nowners, we design a privacy-preserving permutation scheme to prevent the data\nowners from learning the FM through model extraction attacks. Finally, a secure\naggregation protocol is employed for federated learning of the low-rank\nparallel adapters. Empirical results on four datasets demonstrate the practical\nfeasibility of the proposed framework.",

We studied 50 white dwarfs with\nhydrogen-dominated atmospheres, performing a detailed analysis of\nhigh-resolution (R ~ 18,500) spectra by means of state-of-the-art grids of\nsynthetic models and specialized software. Hence, we measured accurate radial\nvelocities from the H-alpha and H-beta line-cores, thus obtaining the white\ndwarf gravitational redshifts. Jointly with a photometric analysis that is\nformalized by a Bayesian inference method, we measured precise white dwarf\nradii that allowed us to directly measure the white dwarf masses from their\ngravitational redshifts. The distributions of measured masses and radii agree\nwithin 6% (at the 1-sigma level) from the theoretical mass-radius relation,\nthus delivering a much smaller scatter in comparison with previous analyses\nthat used gravitational redshift measurements from low-resolution spectra. A\ncomparison against model-dependent spectroscopic estimates produces a larger\nscatter of 15% on the mass determinations. We find an agreement within ~10%\nfrom previous model-based, photometric mass estimates from the literature.\nCombining gravitational redshift measurements and photometric analysis of white\ndwarfs delivers precise and accurate, empirical estimates of their masses and\nradii. This work confirms the reliability of the theoretical mass-radius\nrelation from the lightest to the heaviest white dwarfs in our sample (0.38-1.3\nMsun). [abridged]",

    "abstract": "To efficiently manage serverless computing platforms, a key aspect is the\nauto-scaling of services, i.e., the set of computational resources allocated to\na service adapts over time as a function of the traffic demand. The objective\nis to find a compromise between user-perceived performance and energy\nconsumption. In this paper, we consider the \\emph{scale-per-request}\nauto-scaling pattern and investigate how many function instances (or servers)\nshould be spawned each time an \\emph{unfortunate} job arrives, i.e., a job that\nfinds all servers busy upon its arrival. We address this problem by following a\nstochastic optimization approach: we develop a stochastic gradient descent\nscheme of the Kiefer--Wolfowitz type that applies \\emph{over a single run of\nthe state evolution}. At each iteration, the proposed scheme computes an\nestimate of the number of servers to spawn each time an unfortunate job arrives\nto minimize some cost function. Under natural assumptions, we show that the\nsequence of estimates produced by our scheme is asymptotically optimal almost\nsurely. In addition, we prove that its convergence rate is $O(n^{-2/3})$ where\n$n$ is the number of iterations.\n  From a mathematical point of view, the stochastic optimization framework\ninduced by auto-scaling exhibits non-standard aspects that we approach from a\ngeneral point of view. We consider the setting where a controller can only get\nsamples of the \\emph{transient} -- rather than stationary -- behavior of the\nunderlying stochastic system. To handle this difficulty, we develop arguments\nthat exploit properties of the mixing time of the underlying Markov chain. By\nmeans of numerical simulations, we validate the proposed approach and quantify\nits gain with respect to common existing scale-up rules.",

Here,\nwe study a conceptual model of the mid-latitudes' atmospheric circulation from\nthe perspective of nonautonomous dynamical systems. First, a bifurcation\nanalysis is carried out under time-independent forcing in order to identify\ndifferent types of behavior in the autonomous model's parameter space. Next, we\nfocus on the study of the nonautonomous system in which the cross-latitudinal\nheat flux varies seasonally, according to insolation changes. The forward\nattractor of the seasonally forced model is compared with the attractor of the\nautonomous one. The seasonal forcing results in a clear change of the\nattractor's shape. The summer attractor loses its periodicity, and hence\npredictability, when the forcing is seasonal, while the winter attractor favors\nenergy transport through one of the model's two wave components. Climate change\nforcing produces several remarkable effects. Thus, the analysis of the model's\nsnapshot attractor under climate trends suggests that the jet speed does not\nalways follow the sign of the change in equator-to-pole thermal contrast, while\nthe change in the energy transported by the eddies does. Chaotic behavior can\nbe completely suppressed in favor of a regular periodic one and vice-versa.\nCirculation patterns can change, suddenly disappear, and rebuild.

However,\nmost existing RL frameworks rely on online interaction with the environment,\nwhich might not be feasible due to safety and cost concerns. Another problem\nwith online RL is the lack of scalability of the designed algorithm with\ndynamic or new environments. This work proposes a novel, resilient, few-shot\nmeta-offline RL algorithm combining offline RL using conservative Q-learning\n(CQL) and meta-learning using model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). The proposed\nalgorithm can train RL models using static offline datasets without any online\ninteraction with the environments. In addition, with the aid of MAML, the\nproposed model can be scaled up to new unseen environments. We showcase the\nproposed algorithm for optimizing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 's\ntrajectory and scheduling policy to minimize the age-of-information (AoI) and\ntransmission power of limited-power devices. Numerical results show that the\nproposed few-shot meta-offline RL algorithm converges faster than baseline\nschemes, such as deep Q-networks and CQL. In addition, it is the only algorithm\nthat can achieve optimal joint AoI and transmission power using an offline\ndataset with few shots of data points and is resilient to network failures due\nto unprecedented environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "We present counterfactual situation testing (CST), a causal data mining\nframework for detecting individual discrimination in a dataset of classifier\ndecisions. CST answers the question ``what would have been the model outcome\nhad the individual, or complainant, been of a different protected status?'' It\nextends the legally-grounded situation testing (ST) of Thanh et al. (2011) by\noperationalizing the notion of \"fairness given the difference\" via\ncounterfactual reasoning. ST finds for each complainant similar protected and\nnon-protected instances in the dataset; constructs, respectively, a control and\ntest group; and compares the groups such that a difference in model outcomes\nimplies a potential case of individual discrimination. CST, instead, avoids\nthis idealized comparison by establishing the test group on the complainant's\ngenerated counterfactual, which reflects how the protected attribute when\nchanged influences other seemingly neutral attributes of the complainant. Under\nCST we test for discrimination for each complainant by comparing similar\nindividuals within the control and test group but dissimilar individuals across\nthese groups. We consider single (e.g.,~gender) and multidimensional\n(e.g.,~gender and race) discrimination testing. For multidimensional\ndiscrimination we study multiple and intersectional discrimination and, as\nfeared by legal scholars, find evidence that the former fails to account for\nthe latter kind. Using a k-nearest neighbor implementation, we showcase CST on\nsynthetic and real data. Experimental results show that CST uncovers a higher\nnumber of cases than ST, even when the model is counterfactually fair. CST, in\nfact, extends counterfactual fairness (CF) of Kusner et al.

    "abstract": "It is well-known that in the logic of quantum mechanics disjunctions and\nconjunctions can be represented by joins and meets, respectively, in an\northomodular lattice provided their entries commute. This was the reason why J.\nPykacz introduced new derived operations called ''sharp'' and ''flat''\ncoinciding with joins and meets, respectively, for commuting elements but\nsharing some appropriate properties with disjunction and conjunction,\nrespectively, in the whole orthomodular lattice in question. The problem is\nthat orthomodular lattices need not formalize the logic of quantum mechanics\nsince joins may not be defined provided their entries are neither comparable\nnor orthogonal. A corresponding fact holds for meets. Therefore, orthomodular\nposets are more accepted as an algebraic formalization of such a logic. The aim\nof the present paper is to extend the concepts of ''sharp'' and ''flat''\noperations to operators in skew orthomodular and strong skew orthomodular\nposets. We generalize the relation of commuting elements as well as the\ncommutator to such posets and we present some important properties of these\noperators and their mutual relationships. Moreover, we show that if the poset\nin question is even Boolean then there can be defined a ternary operator\nsharing the identities of a Pixley term.

    "abstract": "There have been extensive studies on learning in zero-sum games, focusing on\nthe analysis of the existence and algorithmic convergence of Nash equilibrium\n(NE). Existing studies mainly focus on symmetric games where the strategy\nspaces of the players are of the same type and size. For the few studies that\ndo consider asymmetric games, they are mostly restricted to matrix games. In\nthis paper, we define and study a new practical class of asymmetric games\ncalled two-player Asymmetric Combinatorial-Continuous zEro-Sum (ACCES) games,\nfeaturing a combinatorial action space for one player and an infinite compact\nspace for the other. Such ACCES games have broad implications in the real\nworld, particularly in combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) where one\nplayer optimizes a solution in a combinatorial space, and the opponent plays\nagainst it in an infinite (continuous) compact space (e.g., a nature player\ndeciding epistemic parameters of the environmental model). Our first key\ncontribution is to prove the existence of NE for two-player ACCES games, using\nthe idea of essentially finite game approximation. Building on the theoretical\ninsights and double oracle (DO)-based solutions to complex zero-sum games, our\nsecond contribution is to design the novel algorithm, Combinatorial Continuous\nDO (CCDO), to solve ACCES games, and prove the convergence of the proposed\nalgorithm. Considering the NP-hardness of most COPs and recent advancements in\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions to COPs, our third contribution is\nto propose a practical algorithm to solve NE in the real world, CCDORL (based\non CCDO), and provide the novel convergence analysis in the ACCES game.\nExperimental results across diverse instances of COPs demonstrate the empirical\neffectiveness of our algorithms.

    ],
    "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is one of the fundamental dynamical processes in the\nsolar corona. The method of studying reconnection in active region-scale\nmagnetic fields generally depends on non-local methods (i.e. requiring\ninformation across the magnetic field under study) of magnetic topology, such\nas separatrix skeletons and quasi-separatrix layers. The theory of General\nMagnetic Reconnection is also non-local, in that its measure of the\nreconnection rate depends on determining the maxima of integrals along field\nlines. In this work, we complement the above approaches by introducing a local\ndescription of magnetic reconnection, that is one in which information about\nreconnection at a particular location depends only on quantities at that\nlocation. This description connects the concept of the field line slippage\nrate, relative to ideal motion, to the underlying local geometry of the\nmagnetic field characterized in terms of the Lorentz force and field-aligned\ncurrent density. It is argued that the dominant non-ideal term for the solar\ncorona, discussed in relation to this new description, is mathematically\nequivalent to the anomalous resistivity employed by many magnetohrdrodynamic\nsimulations. However, the general application of this new approach is adaptable\nto the inclusion of other non-ideal terms, which may arise from turbulence\nmodelling or the inclusion of a generalized Ohm's law. The approach is\nillustrated with two examples of coronal magnetic fields related to flux ropes:\nan analytical model and a nonlinear force-free extrapolation. In terms of the\nlatter, the slippage rate corresponds to the reconnection which would happen if\nthe given (static) force-free equilibrium were the instantaneous form of the\nmagnetic field governed by an Ohm's law with non-ideal terms.",

    "abstract": "Character diversity in competitive games, while enriching gameplay, often\nintroduces balance challenges that can negatively impact player experience and\nstrategic depth. Traditional balance assessments rely on aggregate metrics like\nwin rates and pick rates, which offer limited insight into the intricate\ndynamics of team-based games and nuanced character roles. This paper proposes a\nnovel clustering-based methodology to analyze character balance, leveraging\nin-game data from Valorant to account for team composition influences and\nreveal latent character roles.

Their properties, falling between G and M dwarfs, provide an\noptimal trade-off between the prospect of habitability and ease of detection.\nThe KOBE experiment is a blind-search survey exploiting this niche, monitoring\nthe radial velocity of 50 late-type K-dwarf stars. It employs the CARMENES\nspectrograph, with an observational strategy designed to detect planets in the\nhabitable zone of their system. In this work, we exploit the KOBE data set to\ncharacterize planetary signals in the K7V star HIP 5957 (KOBE-1) and to\nconstrain the planetary population within its habitable zone. We used 82\nCARMENES spectra over a time span of three years. We employed a GLS periodogram\nto search for significant periodic signals that would be compatible with\nKeplerian motion on KOBE-1. We carried out a model comparison within a Bayesian\nframework to ensure the significance of the planetary model over alternative\nconfigurations of lower complexity. We also inspected two available TESS\nsectors in search of planetary signals. We identified two signals: at 8.5d and\n29.7d. We confirmed their planetary nature through ruling out other\nnon-planetary configurations. Their minimum masses are 8.80+/-0.76ME and\n12.4+/-1.1ME, corresponding to absolute masses within the planetary regime at a\nhigh certainty (>99.7%). By analyzing the sensitivity of the CARMENES time\nseries to additional signals, we discarded planets above 8.5ME within the\nhabitable zone. We identified a single transit-like feature in TESS, whose\norigin is still uncertain, but still compatible within 1sigma with a transit\nfrom planet c. We have explored future prospects for characterizing this\nsystem, concluding that nulling interferometry with the LIFE mission could be\ncapable of directly imaging both planets and characterizing their atmospheres\nin future studies.",

    "abstract": "Heat-based cancer treatment, so-called hyperthermia, can be used to destroy\ntumour cells directly or to make them more susceptible to chemotherapy or\nradiation therapy. To apply heat locally, iron oxide nanoparticles are injected\ninto the bloodstream and accumulate at the tumour site, where they generate\nheat when exposed to an alternating magnetic field. However, the temperature\nmust be precisely controlled to achieve therapeutic benefits while avoiding\ndamage to healthy tissue. We therefore present a computational model for\nnanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia treatment fully integrated into a multiphase\nporous-media model of the tumour and its microenvironment. We study how the\ntemperature depends on the amount of nanoparticles accumulated in the tumour\narea and the specific absorption rate of the nanoparticles. Our results show\nthat host tissue surrounding the tumour is also exposed to considerable doses\nof heat due to the high thermal conductivity of the tissue, which may cause\npain or even unnecessary irreversible damage. Further, we include a lumped and\na discrete model for the cooling effect of blood perfusion. Using a discrete\nmodel of a realistic microvasculature reveals that the small capillaries do not\nhave a significant cooling effect during hyperthermia treatment and that the\ncommonly used lumped model based on Pennes' bioheat equation overestimates the\neffect: within the specific conditions analysed, the difference between lumped\nand discrete approaches is approximatively 0.75{\\deg}C, which could influence\nthe therapeutic intervention outcome. Such a comprehensive computational model,\nas presented here, can provide insights into the optimal treatment parameters\nfor nanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia and can be used to design more efficient\ntreatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Context. The HI distribution at high Galactic latitudes is found to be\nfilamentary and closely related to the far infrared (FIR) in caustics with\ncoherent velocity structures. These structures trace the orientation of the\nmagnetic field lines. Aims. Recent absorption observations with the Australian\nSKA Pathfinder Telescope have led to major improvements in our understanding of\nthe physical properties of the cold neutral medium (CNM) at high Galactic\nlatitudes. We use these results to explore how far the physical state of the\nCNM may be related with caustics in HI and FIR. Methods. We trace filamentary\nFIR and HI structures and probe the absorption data for coincidences in\nposition and velocity. Results. 57 percent of the absorption positions are\nassociated with known FIR/HI caustics, filamentary dusty structures with a\ncoherent velocity field. The remaining part of the absorption sample is\ncoincident in position and velocity with genuine HI filaments that are closely\nrelated to the FIR counterparts. Thus, within the current sensitivity\nlimitations, all of the positions with HI absorption lines are associated with\nfilamentary structures in FIR and/or HI. We summarize physical parameters for\nthen CNM along filaments in the framework of filament velocities that have been\ndetermined from a Hessian analysis of FIR and HI emission data. Velocity\ndeviations between absorption components and filament velocities are due to\nlocal turbulence and we determine for the observed CNM an average turbulent\nvelocity dispersion of 2.48 < delta_vturb < 3.9 km/s. The CNM has a mean\nturbulent Mach number of Mt = 3.4 +/- 1.6 km/s. Conclusions. Most, if not all,\nof the CNM in the diffuse ISM at high Galactic latitudes is located in\nfilaments, identified as caustics with the Hessian operator.",

To address this issue, we propose Action\nTemporal Coherence Learning (AcTOL) to learn ordered and continuous\nvision-language representations without rigid goal-based constraint. AcTOL\ntreats a video as a continuous trajectory where it (1) contrasts semantic\ndifferences between frames to reflect their natural ordering, and (2) imposes a\nlocal Brownian bridge constraint to ensure smooth transitions across\nintermediate frames.

We observe that existing meta-learning-based methods are\ngenerally not well-suited for this task, while VFMs hold great potential. We\nfurther systematically study the applicability of various VFMs in this task,\ninvolving two paradigms: feature matching and the use of Segment Anything (SAM)\nmodels.

Laser\ninterferometers used for on-ground prototyping and testing of such instruments\nare typically constructed by permanently bonding or gluing optics onto an\nultra-stable bench made of low-expansion glass ceramic. This design minimizes\ntemperature coupling to length and tilt, which dominates the noise at low\nfrequencies due to finite temperature stability achievable in laboratories and\nvacuum environments. Here, we present the study of an alternative\nopto-mechanical concept where optical components are placed with adjustable and\nfreely positionable mounts on an ultra-stable bench, while maintaining\npicometer length stability. With this concept, a given interferometer\nconfiguration can be realised very quickly due to a simplified and speed-up\nassembly process, reducing the realisation time from weeks or months to a\nmatter of hours. We built a corresponding test facility and verified the length\nstability of our concept by measuring the length change in an optical cavity\nthat was probed with two different locking schemes, heterodyne laser frequency\nstabilisation and Pound-Drever-Hall locking. We studied the limitations of both\nlocking schemes and verified that the cavity length noise is below 1\npm/sqrt(Hz) for frequencies down to 3 mHz. We thereby demonstrate that our\nconcept can simplify the testing of interferometer configurations and\nopto-mechanical components and is suitable to realise flexible optical ground\nsupport equipment for space missions that use laser interferometry, such as\nfuture space-based gravitational wave detectors and satellite geodesy missions.",

    "abstract": "Achieving consensus in group decision-making often involves overcoming\nsignificant challenges, particularly in reconciling diverse perspectives and\nmitigating biases that hinder agreement. Traditional methods relying on human\nfacilitators are often constrained by scalability and efficiency, especially in\nlarge-scale, fast-paced discussions. To address these challenges, this study\nproposes a novel framework employing large language models (LLMs) as automated\nfacilitators within a custom-built multi-user chat system. Leveraging cosine\nsimilarity as a core metric, this approach evaluates the ability of three\nstate-of-the-art LLMs- ChatGPT 4.0, Mistral Large 2, and AI21 Jamba Instruct-\nto synthesize consensus proposals that align with participants' viewpoints.\nUnlike conventional techniques, the system integrates adaptive facilitation\nstrategies, including clarifying misunderstandings, summarizing discussions,\nand proposing compromises, enabling the LLMs to iteratively refine consensus\nproposals based on user feedback. Experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of ChatGPT 4.0, which achieves higher alignment with participant\nopinions, requiring fewer iterations to reach consensus compared to its\ncounterparts. Moreover, analysis reveals the nuanced performance of the models\nacross various sustainability-focused discussion topics, such as climate\naction, quality education, good health and well-being, and access to clean\nwater and sanitation. These findings highlight the transformative potential of\nLLM-driven facilitation for improving collective decision-making processes and\nunderscore the importance of advancing evaluation metrics and cross-cultural\nadaptability in future research.",

Hence, the scheme of one-shot joint training\nmultiple precisions is proposed to address this issue. Previous works either\nstore a larger FP32 model to switch between different precision models for\nhigher accuracy or store a smaller INT8 model but compromise accuracy due to\nusing shared quantization parameters.

Furthermore, we\nobserve a competitive interference among different precisions during one-shot\njoint training, primarily due to inconsistent gradients of quantization scales\nduring backward propagation. To tackle this problem, we propose an Adaptive\nLearning Rate Scaling (ALRS) technique that dynamically adapts learning rates\nfor various precisions to optimize the training process.

    "abstract": "Despite their widespread adoption, cellular networks face growing\nvulnerabilities due to their inherent complexity and the integration of\nadvanced technologies. One of the major threats in this landscape is Voice over\nIP (VoIP) to GSM gateways, known as SIMBox devices. These devices use multiple\nSIM cards to route VoIP traffic through cellular networks, enabling\ninternational bypass fraud with losses of up to $3.11 billion annually. Beyond\nfinancial impact, SIMBox activity degrades network performance, threatens\nnational security, and facilitates eavesdropping on communications. Existing\ndetection methods for SIMBox activity are hindered by evolving fraud techniques\nand implementation complexities, limiting their practical adoption in operator\nnetworks.This paper addresses the limitations of current detection methods by\nintroducing SigN , a novel approach to identifying SIMBox activity at the\ncellular edge. The proposed method focuses on detecting remote SIM card\nassociation, a technique used by SIMBox appliances to mimic human mobility\npatterns. The method detects latency anomalies between SIMBox and standard\ndevices by analyzing cellular signaling during network attachment. Extensive\nindoor and outdoor experiments demonstrate that SIMBox devices generate\nsignificantly higher attachment latencies, particularly during the\nauthentication phase, where latency is up to 23 times greater than that of\nstandard devices. We attribute part of this overhead to immutable factors such\nas LTE authentication standards and Internet-based communication protocols.\nTherefore, our approach offers a robust, scalable, and practical solution to\nmitigate SIMBox activity risks at the network edge.",

Two inherent issues\ncontribute to concept unreliability: sensitivity to concept-irrelevant features\n(e.g., background variations) and lack of semantic consistency for the same\nconcept across different samples.

In\nthis paper, we expect to relax this assumption by defining a new blind video\ninpainting setting, enabling the networks to learn the mapping from corrupted\nvideo to inpainted result directly, eliminating the need of corrupted region\nannotations. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end blind video inpainting\nnetwork (BVINet) to address both \"where to inpaint\" and \"how to inpaint\"\nsimultaneously. On the one hand, BVINet can predict the masks of corrupted\nregions by detecting semantic-discontinuous regions of the frame and utilizing\ntemporal consistency prior of the video. On the other hand, the predicted masks\nare incorporated into the BVINet, allowing it to capture valid context\ninformation from uncorrupted regions to fill in corrupted ones. Besides, we\nintroduce a consistency loss to regularize the training parameters of BVINet.\nIn this way, mask prediction and video completion mutually constrain each\nother, thereby maximizing the overall performance of the trained model.\nFurthermore, we customize a dataset consisting of synthetic corrupted videos,\nreal-world corrupted videos, and their corresponding completed videos. This\ndataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing blind video inpainting\nresearch. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and\nsuperiority of our method.",

Label Distribution Learning (LDL), an extension of MLL to\nlearning from label distributions, faces challenges in collecting accurate\nlabel distributions. To address the issue of biased annotations, based on the\nlow-rank assumption, existing works recover true distributions from biased\nobservations by exploring the label correlations. However, recent evidence\nshows that the label distribution tends to be full-rank, and naive apply of\nlow-rank approximation on biased observation leads to inaccurate recovery and\nperformance degradation. In this paper, we address the LDL with biased\nannotations problem from a novel perspective, where we first degenerate the\nsoft label distribution into a hard multi-hot label and then recover the true\nlabel information for each instance. This idea stems from an insight that\nassigning hard multi-hot labels is often easier than assigning a soft label\ndistribution, and it shows stronger immunity to noise disturbances, leading to\nsmaller label bias. Moreover, assuming that the multi-label space for\npredicting label distributions is low-rank offers a more reasonable approach to\ncapturing label correlations.

    "abstract": "We revisit the renormalization group (RG) analysis of the Kohn-Luttinger (KL)\nmechanism for superconductivity. The KL mechanism leads to superconductivity in\na system with a repulsive bare interaction. The key ingredient is the screening\neffect that renders the induced interaction attractive in channels with nonzero\nangular momentum $\\ell \\neq 0$, thereby triggering the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) instability. According to the original\nargument, the resulting gap is exponentially small, with its exponent scaling\nas $-\\ell^4$. However, the KL mechanism was originally formulated within\nperturbation theory, where the series is known to converge poorly in certain\ncases -- most notably, for the p-wave paring gap induced by a repulsive s-wave\ncontact interaction. This poor convergence may be attributed to a divergent\nintegrand in a specific class of diagrams containing both the BCS logarithm and\nthe Kohn anomaly, suggesting that one must resum the Kohn anomaly contributions\nseparately from the BCS logarithm. In this work, we incorporate the Kohn\nanomaly contribution into the beta function of the RG equation governing the\nBCS instability near the Fermi surface. Our solution shows that the KL gap\nexponent is then proportional to $-\\ell$, indicating a significant enhancement\nof the KL mechanism beyond the previously known result. To illustrate this, we\nstudy the spin-triplet p-wave pairing gap arising from a repulsive s-wave\ncontact interaction and compare our RG-based results with those obtained from\nthe Bethe-Salpeter equation in perturbation theory.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal fusion leverages information across modalities to learn better\nfeature representations with the goal of improving performance in fusion-based\ntasks. However, multimodal datasets, especially in medical settings, are\ntypically smaller than their unimodal counterparts, which can impede the\nperformance of multimodal models. Additionally, the increase in the number of\nmodalities is often associated with an overall increase in the size of the\nmultimodal network, which may be undesirable in medical use cases. Utilizing\nsmaller unimodal encoders may lead to sub-optimal performance, particularly\nwhen dealing with high-dimensional clinical data. In this paper, we propose the\nModality-INformed knowledge Distillation (MIND) framework, a multimodal model\ncompression approach based on knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge\nfrom ensembles of pre-trained deep neural networks of varying sizes into a\nsmaller multimodal student. The teacher models consist of unimodal networks,\nallowing the student to learn from diverse representations. MIND employs\nmulti-head joint fusion models, as opposed to single-head models, enabling the\nuse of unimodal encoders in the case of unimodal samples without requiring\nimputation or masking of absent modalities. As a result, MIND generates an\noptimized multimodal model, enhancing both multimodal and unimodal\nrepresentations. It can also be leveraged to balance multimodal learning during\ntraining. We evaluate MIND on binary and multilabel clinical prediction tasks\nusing time series data and chest X-ray images. Additionally, we assess the\ngeneralizability of the MIND framework on three non-medical multimodal\nmulticlass datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MIND enhances the\nperformance of the smaller multimodal network across all five tasks, as well as\nvarious fusion methods and multimodal architectures, compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

We show that this exponential tail is rather robust and holds for a whole\nfamily of linear interface models parametrized by a dynamical exponent $z>1$,\nwith $z=2$ corresponding to the Edwards-Wilkinson model.",

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks have posed a significant threat to the security of deep\nneural networks (DNNs). Despite considerable strides in developing defenses\nagainst backdoor attacks in the visual domain, the specialized defenses for the\naudio domain remain empty. Furthermore, the defenses adapted from the visual to\naudio domain demonstrate limited effectiveness. To fill this gap, we propose\nGradient Norm-based FineTuning (GN-FT), a novel defense strategy against the\nattacks in the audio domain, based on the observation from the corresponding\nbackdoored models. Specifically, we first empirically find that the backdoored\nneurons exhibit greater gradient values compared to other neurons, while clean\nneurons stay the lowest. On this basis, we fine-tune the backdoored model by\nincorporating the gradient norm regularization, aiming to weaken and reduce the\nbackdoored neurons. We further approximate the loss computation for lower\nimplementation costs. Extensive experiments on two speech recognition datasets\nacross five models demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this work is the first specialized and effective\ndefense against backdoor attacks in the audio domain.",

It becomes\nrelevant to study the Ginzburg-Landau theory in curved space, that is, in the\npresence of gravity. In this paper, some existence theorems are established for\nthe vortex solutions of the magnetic Ginzburg-Landau theory coupled to the\nEinstein equations. First, when the coupling constant \\lambda=1, we get a\nself-dual structure from the Ginzburg-Landau theory, then a partial\ndifferential equation with a gravitational term that has power-type\nsingularities is deduced from the coupled system. To overcome the difficulty\narising from the orders of singularities at the vortices, a constraint\nminimization method and a monotone iteration method are employed. We also show\nthat the quantized flux and total curvature are determined by the number of\nvortices. Second, when the coupling constant \\lambda>0, we use a suitable\nansatz to get the radially symmetric case for the magnetic Ginzburg-Landau\ntheory in curved space. The existence of the symmetric vortex solutions are\nobtained through combining a two-step iterative shooting argument and a\nfixed-point theorem approach.

The\nresults suggest that the gamma-ray emitting region lies outside the broad-line\nregion but within the dusty torus.

While compressive sensing (CS) has recently been\napplied to pulsed-waveform radars with sparse measurements, its application to\nfrequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar for target detection remains\nlargely unexplored.

Then, ASAP fine-tunes pre-trained policies with the\ndelta action model integrated into the simulator to align effectively with\nreal-world dynamics. We evaluate ASAP across three transfer scenarios: IsaacGym\nto IsaacSim, IsaacGym to Genesis, and IsaacGym to the real-world Unitree G1\nhumanoid robot. Our approach significantly improves agility and whole-body\ncoordination across various dynamic motions, reducing tracking error compared\nto SysID, DR, and delta dynamics learning baselines.

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of pervasive and mobile computing has led to an\nunprecedented rate of data production and consumption by mobile applications at\nthe network edge. These applications often require interactions such as data\nexchange, behavior coordination, and collaboration, which are typically\nmediated by cloud servers. While cloud computing has been effective for\ndistributed systems, challenges like latency, cost, and intermittent\nconnectivity persist. With the advent of 5G technology, features like\nlocation-awareness and device-to-device (D2D) communication enable a more\ndistributed and adaptive architecture. This paper introduces Self-Organizing\nInteraction Spaces (SOIS), a novel framework for engineering pervasive\napplications. SOIS leverages the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of mobile\nnodes, allowing them to form adaptive organizational structures based on their\nindividual and social contexts. The framework provides two key abstractions for\nmodeling and programming pervasive applications using an organizational mindset\nand mechanisms for adapting dynamic organizational structures. Case examples\nand performance evaluations of a simulated mobile crowd-sensing application\ndemonstrate the feasibility and benefits of SOIS. Results highlight its\npotential to enhance efficiency and reduce reliance on traditional cloud\nmodels, paving the way for innovative solutions in mobile and distributed\nenvironments.",

Additionally, a cross-modal interaction module employs a\nco-attention mechanism to establish and model dependencies between the refined\nunimodal representations, facilitating seamless semantic integration across\nmodalities. To explicitly extract inconsistency features, we propose an inverse\nattention mechanism that effectively highlights the conflicting patterns and\nsemantic deviations introduced by fake news in both intra- and inter-modality.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MIAN significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its pivotal contribution to\nadvancing social security through enhanced multimodal fake news detection.",

Asking a language model to assess its confidence (\"Score your\nconfidence from 0-1.\") is a natural way of evaluating its uncertainty. However,\nmodels struggle to provide absolute assessments of confidence (i.e. judging\nconfidence in answering a question independent of other questions) and the\ncoarse-grained scores they produce are not useful for evaluating the\ncorrectness of their answers. We propose relative confidence estimation, where\nwe match up questions against each other and ask the model to make relative\njudgments of confidence (\"Which question are you more confident in answering\ncorrectly?\"). Treating each question as a \"player\" in a series of matchups\nagainst other questions and the model's preferences as match outcomes, we can\nuse rank aggregation methods like Elo rating and Bradley-Terry to translate the\nmodel's confidence preferences into confidence scores. We evaluate relative\nconfidence estimation against absolute confidence estimation and\nself-consistency confidence methods on five state-of-the-art LMs -- GPT-4,\nGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3.1 405B -- across 14\nchallenging STEM, social science, and commonsense reasoning question answering\ntasks. Our results demonstrate that relative confidence estimation consistently\nprovides more reliable confidence scores than absolute confidence estimation,\nwith average gains of 3.5% in selective classification AUC over direct absolute\nconfidence estimation methods and 1.7% over self-consistency approaches across\nall models and datasets.",

However, designing powerful and\nefficient PEs for graphs poses significant challenges due to the absence of\ncanonical node ordering and the scale of the graph. {In this work, we identify\nfour key properties that graph PEs should satisfy}: stability, expressive\npower, scalability, and genericness. We find that existing eigenvector-based PE\nmethods often fall short of jointly satisfying these criteria. To address this\ngap, we introduce PEARL, a novel framework of learnable PEs for graphs. Our\nprimary insight is that message-passing GNNs function as nonlinear mappings of\neigenvectors, enabling the design of GNN architectures for generating powerful\nand efficient PEs. A crucial challenge lies in initializing node attributes in\na manner that is both expressive and permutation equivariant. We tackle this by\ninitializing GNNs with random node inputs or standard basis vectors, thereby\nunlocking the expressive power of message-passing operations, while employing\nstatistical pooling functions to maintain permutation equivariance. Our\nanalysis demonstrates that PEARL approximates equivariant functions of\neigenvectors with linear complexity, while rigorously establishing its\nstability and high expressive power. Experimental evaluations show that PEARL\noutperforms lightweight versions of eigenvector-based PEs and achieves\ncomparable performance to full eigenvector-based PEs, but with one or two\norders of magnitude lower complexity.

Focusing on two-dimensional percolation, we show that the size\ndistribution of the largest cluster asymptotically approaches to a Gumbel form\nin the subcritical phase, a Gaussian form in the supercritical phase, and\ntransitions within the critical finite-size scaling window. Numerical results\nindicate that, at consistently defined pseudocritical points, this distribution\nexhibits a universal form across various lattices and percolation models (bond\nor site), within error bars, yet differs from the distribution at the critical\npoint. The critical polynomial, universally zero for two-dimensional\npercolation at the critical point, becomes nonzero at pseudocritical points.\nNevertheless, numerical evidence suggests that the critical polynomial, along\nwith other dimensionless quantities such as wrapping probabilities and Binder\ncumulants, assumes fixed values at the pseudocritical point that are\nindependent of the percolation type (bond or site) but vary with lattice\nstructures.

Therefore, we propose an alternative approach\nwhich combines the strengths of classical MAB and LLMs. Specifically, we adopt\na classical MAB algorithm as the high-level framework and leverage the strong\nin-context learning capability of LLMs to perform the sub-task of reward\nprediction. Firstly, we incorporate the LLM-based reward predictor into the\nclassical Thompson sampling (TS) algorithm and adopt a decaying schedule for\nthe LLM temperature to ensure a transition from exploration to exploitation.\nNext, we incorporate the LLM-based reward predictor (with a temperature of 0)\ninto a regression oracle-based MAB algorithm equipped with an explicit\nexploration mechanism. We also extend our TS-based algorithm to dueling bandits\nwhere only the preference feedback between pairs of arms is available, which\nrequires non-trivial algorithmic modifications. We conduct empirical\nevaluations using both synthetic MAB tasks and experiments designed using\nreal-world text datasets, in which the results show that our algorithms\nconsistently outperform previous baseline methods based on direct arm\nselection.

    "abstract": "Seismic data often face challenges in their utilization due to noise\ncontamination, incomplete acquisition, and limited low-frequency information,\nwhich hinder accurate subsurface imaging and interpretation. Traditional\nprocessing methods rely heavily on task-specific designs to address these\nchallenges and fail to account for the variability of data. To address these\nlimitations, we present a generative seismic foundation model (GSFM), a unified\nframework based on generative diffusion models (GDMs), designed to tackle\nmulti-task seismic processing challenges, including denoising, backscattered\nnoise attenuation, interpolation, and low-frequency extrapolation. GSFM\nleverages a pre-training stage on synthetic data to capture the features of\nclean, complete, and broadband seismic data distributions and applies an\niterative fine-tuning strategy to adapt the model to field data. By adopting a\ntarget-oriented diffusion process prediction, GSFM improves computational\nefficiency without compromising accuracy. Synthetic data tests demonstrate GSFM\nsurpasses benchmarks with equivalent architectures in all tasks and achieves\nperformance comparable to traditional pre-training strategies, even after their\nfine-tuning. Also, field data tests suggest that our iterative fine-tuning\napproach addresses the generalization limitations of conventional pre-training\nand fine-tuning paradigms, delivering significantly enhanced performance across\ndiverse tasks. Furthermore, GSFM's inherent probabilistic nature enables\neffective uncertainty quantification, offering valuable insights into the\nreliability of processing results.",

    "abstract": "The nonlinear filter model is an old and well understood approach to the\ndesign of secure stream ciphers. Extensive research over several decades has\nshown how to attack stream ciphers based on this model and has identified the\nsecurity properties required of the Boolean function used as the filtering\nfunction to resist such attacks. This led to the problem of constructing\nBoolean functions which provide adequate security \\textit{and} at the same time\nare efficient to implement. Unfortunately, over the last two decades no good\nsolutions to this problem appeared in the literature. The lack of good\nsolutions has effectively led to nonlinear filter model becoming more or less\nobsolete. This is a big loss to the cryptographic design toolkit, since the\ngreat advantages of the nonlinear filter model are its simplicity, well\nunderstood security and the potential to provide low cost solutions for\nhardware oriented stream ciphers. In this paper, we revive the nonlinear filter\nmodel by constructing appropriate Boolean functions which provide required\nsecurity and are also efficient to implement. We put forward concrete\nsuggestions of stream ciphers which are $\\kappa$-bit secure against known types\nof attacks for $\\kappa=80,128,160,192,224$ and $256$. For the $80$-bit,\n$128$-bit, and the $256$-bit security levels, the circuits for the\ncorresponding stream ciphers require about 1743.5, 2771.5, and 5607.5 NAND\ngates respectively. For the $80$-bit and the $128$-bit security levels, the\ngate count estimates compare quite well to the famous ciphers Trivium and\nGrain-128a respectively, while for the $256$-bit security level, we do not know\nof any other stream cipher design which has such a low gate count.",

However,\ncollecting large-scale trajectory datasets is challenging due to factors such\nas commercial conflicts and privacy regulations. Therefore, we urgently need\ntrajectory generation techniques to address this issue. Existing trajectory\ngeneration methods rely on the global road network structure of cities. When\nthe road network structure changes, these methods are often not transferable to\nother cities. In fact, there exist invariant mobility patterns between\ndifferent cities: 1) People prefer paths with the minimal travel cost; 2) The\ntravel cost of roads has an invariant relationship with the topological\nfeatures of the road network. Based on the above insight, this paper proposes a\nGeneralizable Trajectory Generation model (GTG). The model consists of three\nparts: 1) Extracting city-invariant road representation based on Space Syntax\nmethod; 2) Cross-city travel cost prediction through disentangled adversarial\ntraining; 3) Travel preference learning by shortest path search and preference\nupdate. By learning invariant movement patterns, the model is capable of\ngenerating trajectories in new cities.

Our model, trained via Conditional Flow\nMatching, demonstrates better performance in generating imagery with preserved\nstructural and spectral integrity. Cloud imputation is treated as an image\ninpainting task, where the model reconstructs cloud-contaminated pixels and\nfills gaps caused by scan lines during inference by leveraging the learned\ngenerative processes.

However, controlling photonic qubits\nremains challenging, even at small scales, due to their weak interactions,\nmaking non-deterministic gates in linear optics unavoidable. Nevertheless, a\nsingle photon can readily spread over multiple modes and create entanglement\nwithin the multiple modes deterministically. Rudolph's concept of third\nquantization leverages this feature by evolving multiple single-photons into\nmultiple modes, distributing them uniformly and randomly to different parties,\nand creating multipartite entanglement without interactions between photons or\nnon-deterministic gates. This method requires only classical communication and\ndeterministic entanglement within multi-mode single-photon states and enables\nuniversal quantum computing. The multipartite entanglement generated within the\nthird quantization framework is nearly deterministic, where ``deterministic''\nis achieved in the asymptotic limit of a large system size. In this work, we\npropose a near-term experiment using antimony donor in a silicon chip to\nrealize third quantization. Utilizing the eight energy levels of antimony, one\ncan generate two eight-mode single-photon states independently and distribute\nthem to parties. This enables a random multipartite Bell-state experiment,\nachieving a Bell state with an upper-bound efficiency of 87.5% among 56 random\npairs without non-deterministic entangling gates.

Classical dueling bandit\nalgorithms are typically only applicable to a single agent. However, many\napplications of dueling bandits involve multiple agents who wish to collaborate\nfor improved performance yet are unwilling to share their data. This motivates\nus to draw inspirations from federated learning, which involves multiple agents\naiming to collaboratively train their neural networks via gradient descent (GD)\nwithout sharing their raw data. Previous works have developed federated linear\nbandit algorithms which rely on closed-form updates of the bandit parameters\n(e.g., the linear function parameters) to achieve collaboration. However, in\nlinear dueling bandits, the linear function parameters lack a closed-form\nexpression and their estimation requires minimizing a loss function. This\nrenders these previous methods inapplicable. In this work, we overcome this\nchallenge through an innovative and principled combination of online gradient\ndescent (OGD, for minimizing the loss function to estimate the linear function\nparameters) and federated learning, hence introducing our federated linear\ndueling bandit with OGD (FLDB-OGD) algorithm. Through rigorous theoretical\nanalysis, we prove that FLDB-OGD enjoys a sub-linear upper bound on its\ncumulative regret and demonstrate a theoretical trade-off between regret and\ncommunication complexity.

    "abstract": "Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are often trained on datasets of\nquery-response pairs, which embed the ability to use tools or APIs directly\ninto the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Tool-augmented LLMs need the ability to\nforget learned tools due to security vulnerabilities, privacy regulations, or\ntool deprecations. However, ``tool unlearning'' has not been investigated in\nunlearning literature. We introduce this novel task, which requires addressing\ndistinct challenges compared to traditional unlearning: knowledge removal\nrather than forgetting individual samples, the high cost of optimizing LLMs,\nand the need for principled evaluation metrics. To bridge these gaps, we\npropose ToolDelete, the first approach for unlearning tools from tool-augmented\nLLMs. It implements three key properties to address the above challenges for\neffective tool unlearning and introduces a new membership inference attack\n(MIA) model for effective evaluation. Extensive experiments on multiple tool\nlearning datasets and tool-augmented LLMs show that ToolDelete effectively\nunlearns randomly selected tools, while preserving the LLM's knowledge on\nnon-deleted tools and maintaining performance on general tasks.",

However, this benchmark is limited to symbolic\npatterns, whereas humans often perceive and reason about multimodal scenarios\ninvolving both vision and language data. Thus, there is an urgent need to\ninvestigate advanced reasoning capabilities in multimodal tasks.

In each\ngeneric OP, either the objective or the constraints are functions of multiple\narbitrary continuous-domain fractional functions (FFs). This ensures the\nframework's versatility, enabling it to solve a broader range of OPs than\nclassical FMP solvers, like Dinkelbach-based algorithms. Specifically, the\ngeneralized Dinkelbach algorithm can only solve multiple-ratio FMP problems. By\ncontrast, our framework solves OPs associated with a sum or product of multiple\nFFs as the objective or constraint functions. Additionally, our framework\nprovides a single-loop solution, while most FMP solvers require twin-loop\nalgorithms.\n  Many popular performance metrics of wireless communications are FFs. For\ninstance, latency has a fractional structure, and minimizing the sum delay\nleads to an FMP problem. Moreover, the mean square error (MSE) and energy\nefficiency (EE) metrics have fractional structures. Thus, optimizing EE-related\nmetrics such as the sum or geometric mean of EEs and enhancing the metrics\nrelated to spectral-versus-energy-efficiency tradeoff yield FMP problems.\nFurthermore, both the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the channel\ndispersion are FFs.

    "abstract": "We investigate the sample-memory-pass trade-offs for pure exploration in\nmulti-pass streaming multi-armed bandits (MABs) with the *a priori* knowledge\nof the optimality gap $\\Delta_{[2]}$. Here, and throughout, the optimality gap\n$\\Delta_{[i]}$ is defined as the mean reward gap between the best and the\n$i$-th best arms. A recent line of results by Jin, Huang, Tang, and Xiao\n[ICML'21] and Assadi and Wang [COLT'24] have shown that if there is no known\n$\\Delta_{[2]}$, a pass complexity of $\\Theta(\\log(1/\\Delta_{[2]}))$ (up to\n$\\log\\log(1/\\Delta_{[2]})$ terms) is necessary and sufficient to obtain the\n*worst-case optimal* sample complexity of $O(n/\\Delta^{2}_{[2]})$ with a\nsingle-arm memory. However, our understanding of multi-pass algorithms with\nknown $\\Delta_{[2]}$ is still limited. Here, the key open problem is how many\npasses are required to achieve the complexity, i.e., $O(\n\\sum_{i=2}^{n}1/\\Delta^2_{[i]})$ arm pulls, with a sublinear memory size.\n  In this work, we show that the ``right answer'' for the question is\n$\\Theta(\\log{n})$ passes (up to $\\log\\log{n}$ terms). We first present a lower\nbound, showing that any algorithm that finds the best arm with slightly\nsublinear memory -- a memory of $o({n}/{\\text{polylog}({n})})$ arms -- and\n$O(\\sum_{i=2}^{n}{1}/{\\Delta^{2}_{[i]}}\\cdot \\log{(n)})$ arm pulls has to make\n$\\Omega(\\frac{\\log{n}}{\\log\\log{n}})$ passes over the stream. We then show a\nnearly-matching algorithm that assuming the knowledge of $\\Delta_{[2]}$, finds\nthe best arm with $O( \\sum_{i=2}^{n}1/\\Delta^2_{[i]} \\cdot \\log{n})$ arm pulls\nand a *single arm* memory.",

    "abstract": "Preference optimization for diffusion models aims to align them with human\npreferences for images. Previous methods typically use Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs) as pixel-level reward models to approximate human preferences. However,\nwhen used for step-level preference optimization, these models face challenges\nin handling noisy images of different timesteps and require complex\ntransformations into pixel space. In this work, we show that pre-trained\ndiffusion models are naturally suited for step-level reward modeling in the\nnoisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process latent images at\nvarious noise levels. Accordingly, we propose the Latent Reward Model (LRM),\nwhich repurposes components of the diffusion model to predict preferences of\nlatent images at arbitrary timesteps. Building on LRM, we introduce Latent\nPreference Optimization (LPO), a step-level preference optimization method\nconducted directly in the noisy latent space. Experimental results indicate\nthat LPO significantly improves the model's alignment with general, aesthetic,\nand text-image alignment preferences, while achieving a 2.5-28x training\nspeedup over existing preference optimization methods.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of datasets across open data portals and enterprise data\nlakes presents an opportunity for deriving data-driven insights. However,\nwidely-used dataset search systems rely on keyword searches over dataset\nmetadata, including descriptions, to facilitate discovery. When these\ndescriptions are incomplete, missing, or inconsistent with dataset contents,\nfindability is severely hindered. In this paper, we address the problem of\nautomatic dataset description generation: how to generate informative\ndescriptions that enhance dataset discovery and support relevance assessment.\nWe introduce AutoDDG, a framework for automated dataset description generation\ntailored for tabular data. To derive descriptions that are comprehensive,\naccurate, readable and concise, AutoDDG adopts a data-driven approach to\nsummarize the contents of a dataset, and leverages LLMs to both enrich the\nsummaries with semantic information and to derive human-readable descriptions.\nAn important challenge for this problem is how to evaluate the effectiveness of\nmethods for data description generation and the quality of the descriptions. We\npropose a multi-pronged evaluation strategy that: (1) measures the improvement\nin dataset retrieval within a dataset search engine, (2) compares generated\ndescriptions to existing ones (when available), and (3) evaluates intrinsic\nquality metrics such as readability, faithfulness to the data, and conciseness.\nAdditionally, we introduce two new benchmarks to support this evaluation. Our\nexperimental results, using these benchmarks, demonstrate that AutoDDG\ngenerates high-quality, accurate descriptions and significantly improves\ndataset retrieval performance across diverse use cases.",

    "abstract": "Geo-localization is an essential component of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\nnavigation systems to ensure precise absolute self-localization in outdoor\nenvironments. To address the challenges of GPS signal interruptions or low\nillumination, Thermal Geo-localization (TG) employs aerial thermal imagery to\nalign with reference satellite maps to accurately determine the UAV's location.\nHowever, existing TG methods lack uncertainty measurement in their outputs,\ncompromising system robustness in the presence of textureless or corrupted\nthermal images, self-similar or outdated satellite maps, geometric noises, or\nthermal images exceeding satellite maps. To overcome these limitations, this\npaper presents UASTHN, a novel approach for Uncertainty Estimation (UE) in Deep\nHomography Estimation (DHE) tasks for TG applications. Specifically, we\nintroduce a novel Crop-based Test-Time Augmentation (CropTTA) strategy, which\nleverages the homography consensus of cropped image views to effectively\nmeasure data uncertainty. This approach is complemented by Deep Ensembles (DE)\nemployed for model uncertainty, offering comparable performance with improved\nefficiency and seamless integration with any DHE model. Extensive experiments\nacross multiple DHE models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of\nCropTTA in TG applications. Analysis of detected failure cases underscores the\nimproved reliability of CropTTA under challenging conditions. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the capability of combining CropTTA and DE for a comprehensive\nassessment of both data and model uncertainty.

Influence minimization\n(IMIN) is the problem of manipulating the structures of an input graph (e.g.,\nremoving edges) to reduce the propagation among nodes. IMIN can represent\ntime-critical real-world applications, such as rumor blocking, but IMIN is\ntheoretically difficult and computationally expensive. Moreover, the discrete\nnature of IMIN hinders the usage of powerful machine learning techniques, which\nrequires differentiable computation. In this work, we propose DiffIM, a novel\nmethod for IMIN with two differentiable schemes for acceleration: (1) surrogate\nmodeling for efficient influence estimation, which avoids time-consuming\nsimulations (e.g., Monte Carlo), and (2) the continuous relaxation of\ndecisions, which avoids the evaluation of individual discrete decisions (e.g.,\nremoving an edge). We further propose a third accelerating scheme,\ngradient-driven selection, that chooses edges instantly based on gradients\nwithout optimization (spec., gradient descent iterations) on each test\ninstance. Through extensive experiments on real-world graphs, we show that each\nproposed scheme significantly improves speed with little (or even no) IMIN\nperformance degradation.

Dozens\nof such defense and counter-defense mechanisms have recently been discovered,\nyet the number of such systems held by a given virus or its host is limited.\nHere, we present numerical and theoretical arguments for the existence of the\nmaximal number of ecologically and evolutionary sustainable defense and\ncounter-defense systems maintained by both sides at any time of the\nnever-ending evolutionary arms race. We find that the number of such systems is\nof the order of 10 for a broad range of assumptions about the costs and\nbenefits of defense and counter-defense mechanisms and their specificity.

During 2020-2023, GitGuardian has observed an upward\nannual trend and a four-fold increase in hard-coded secrets, with 12.8 million\nexposed in 2023. However, removing all the secrets from software artifacts is\nnot feasible due to time constraints and technical challenges. Additionally,\nthe security risks of the secrets are not equal, protecting assets ranging from\nobsolete databases to sensitive medical data. Thus, secret removal should be\nprioritized by security risk reduction, which existing secret detection tools\ndo not support. The goal of this research is to aid software practitioners in\nprioritizing secrets removal efforts through our security risk-based tool. We\npresent RiskHarvester, a risk-based tool to compute a security risk score based\non the value of the asset and ease of attack on a database. We calculated the\nvalue of asset by identifying the sensitive data categories present in a\ndatabase from the database keywords in the source code. We utilized data flow\nanalysis, SQL, and ORM parsing to identify the database keywords. To calculate\nthe ease of attack, we utilized passive network analysis to retrieve the\ndatabase host information. To evaluate RiskHarvester, we curated RiskBench, a\nbenchmark of 1,791 database secret-asset pairs with sensitive data categories\nand host information manually retrieved from 188 GitHub repositories.\nRiskHarvester demonstrates precision of (95%) and recall (90%) in detecting\ndatabase keywords for the value of asset and precision of (96%) and recall\n(94%) in detecting valid hosts for ease of attack. Finally, we conducted a\nsurvey (52 respondents) to understand whether developers prioritize secret\nremoval based on security risk score.

Exploring the superconductivity of other RP or hybrid RP\nphase nickelates under high pressure has become an urgent and interesting\nissue. Here, we report a novel hybrid RP nickelate superconductor of La5Ni3O11.\nThe hybrid RP nickelate La5Ni3O11 is formed by alternative stacking of La3Ni2O7\nwith n=2 and La2NiO4 with n=1 along the c axis. The transport and magnetic\ntorque measurements indicate a density-wave transition at approximately 170 K\nnear ambient pressure, which is highly similar to both La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10.\nWith increasing pressure, high-pressure transport measurements reveal that the\ndensity-wave transition temperature (TDW) continuously increases to\napproximately 210 K with increasing pressure up to 12 GPa before the appearance\nof pressure-induced superconductivity, and the density-wave transition abruptly\nfades out in a first-order manner at approximately 12 GPa. The optimal\nsuperconductivity with Tconset = 64 K and Tczero = 54 K is achieved at\napproximately 21 GPa.

In contrast to La3Ni2O7 and\nLa4Ni3O10, the pressure-induced structural transition has no significant effect\non either the density-wave transition or the superconductivity, suggesting a\nminor role of lattice degree of freedom in La5Ni3O11.

This system can\nalternatively be interpreted as a spin-degenerate medium with antisymmetric\nelements in the dielectric tensor, corresponding to the spin-1 excitation mode\ncharacterized by a rotational dipole vector. We show that, at leading order,\nthe resulting effective Hamiltonian is equivalent to the Maxwell theory in a\nuniformly rotating frame, incorporating both spin-rotation and orbit-rotation\ncoupling. This rotation arises from the torsion of helical paths, manifesting\nas extrinsic orbital angular momentum (EOAM) of photons. Notably, the spin\nangular momentum (SAM) of the photon and its intrinsic orbital angular momentum\n(IOAM) contribute jointly to the geometric phase. In the Heisenberg picture,\nthe spin and orbital Hall effects naturally emerge from interaction terms in\nthe ray equations. Furthermore, we find that the transverse spin of evanescent\nwaves couples with EOAM, revealing that the geometric phase of elliptically\npolarized light differs from that of circularly polarized light.

Initially, single energy (250 MeV) FLASH pRF plans were created using\npencil beam directions (PBDs) from initial IMPT plans on the planning CT (pCT).\nPBDs are classified as new/changed ($\\Delta$E > > 5 MeV) or unchanged by\ncomparing spot maps for targets between pCT and re-CT. We used an iterative\nleast square regression model to identify recyclable PBDs with minimal relative\nchanges to spot MU weighting. Two PBDs with the least square error were\nretrieved per iteration and added to the background plan, and the remaining\nPBDs were reoptimized for the adaptive plan in subsequent iterations. The\nmethod was validated on three liver SBRT cases (50 Gy in 5 fractions) by\ncomparing various dosimetric parameters across initial pRF plans on pCT, reCT\nand the ADP FLASH pRF plans on reCT. V100 for initial pRF plans on pCT, reCT,\nand ADP FLASH pRF plans for the three cases were as follows: (93.7%, 89.2%,\n91.4%), (93.5%, 60.2%, 91.7%), (97.3%, 69.9%, 98.8%). We observe a decline in\nplan quality when applying the initial pRF to the reCT, whereas the ADP FLASH\npRF approach restores quality comparable to the initial pRF on the pCT. FLASH\neffect of the initial pRF and ADP pRF plans were evaluated with a dose and dose\nrate threshold of 1Gy and 40Gy/s, respectively, using the FLASH effectiveness\nmodel. The proposed method recycled 91.2%, 71%, and 64.7% of PBDs from initial\npRF plans for the three cases while maintaining all clinical goals and\npreserving FLASH effects across all cases.",

Although prior studies suggest that energy rescaling\nimpacts the performance of quantum annealing, its interplay with size-reduction\nmethods remains unexplored. This study examines the relationship between fixing\nspins, a promising size-reduction method, and the effects of energy rescaling.\nNumerical simulations and experiments conducted on a quantum annealer\ndemonstrate that the fixing spins method enhances quantum annealing performance\nwhile preserving the spin-chain embedding for a homogeneous, fully connected\nferromagnetic Ising model.",

    "abstract": "Sliding ferroelectrics constructed from stacked nonpolar monolayers enable\nout-of-plane polarization in two dimensions with exceptional properties,\nincluding ultrafast switching speeds and fatigue-free behavior. However, the\nwidely accepted switching mechanism, which posits synchronized long-distance\nin-plane translation of entire atomic layers driven by an out-of-plane electric\nfield, has shown inconsistencies with experimental observations. We demonstrate\nthat this spinodal decomposition-like homogeneous switching process violates\nNeumann's principle and is unlikely to occur due to symmetry constraint.\nInstead, symmetry-breaking domain walls (DWs) and the tensorial nature of Born\neffective charges are critical for polarization reversal, underscoring the\nquantum nature of sliding ferroelectrics. Using the Bernal-stacked $h$-BN\nbilayer as a model system, we discover that the coherent propagation of wide,\nwave-like domain walls is the key mechanism for ferroelectric switching. This\nmechanism fundamentally differs from the layer-by-layer switching associated\nwith narrow domain walls, which has been established for over sixty years in\nperovskite ferroelectrics. Moreover, these wave-like DWs exhibit superlubric\ndynamics, achieving ultrahigh velocities of approximately 4000 m/s at room\ntemperature and displaying an anomalous cooling-promoted switching speed. The\nunexpected emergence of DW superlubricity in sliding ferroelectrics presents\nnew avenues for enhancing key performance metrics and offers exciting\nopportunities for applications in cryogenic environments.",

A\nground base station (GBS) with large aperture size communicates with one\ncommunication UAV (C-UAV) under the existence of one eavesdropping UAV (E-UAV),\nwhere the artificial noise (AN) is employed for both jamming and sensing\npurpose. Given that the E-UAV's motion model is unknown at the GBS, we first\npropose a near-field localization and trajectory tracking scheme. Specifically,\nexploiting the variant Doppler shift observations over the spatial domain in\nthe near field, the E-UAV's three-dimensional (3D) velocities are estimated\nfrom echo signals. To provide the timely correction of location prediction\nerrors, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is adopted to fuse the predicted\nstates and the measured ones. Subsequently, based on the real-time predicated\nlocation of the E-UAV, we further propose a joint GBS beamforming and C-UAV\ntrajectory design scheme for maximizing the instantaneous secrecy rate, while\nguaranteeing the sensing accuracy constraint. To solve the resultant non-convex\nproblem, an alternating optimization approach is developed, where the\nnear-field GBS beamforming and the C-UAV trajectory design subproblems are\niteratively solved by exploiting the successive convex approximation method.\nFinally, our numerical results unveil that: 1) the E-UAV's 3D velocities and\nlocation can be accurately estimated in real time with our proposed framework\nby exploiting the near-field spherical wave propagation; and 2) the proposed\nframework achieves superior secrecy rate compared to benchmark schemes and\nclosely approaches the performance when the E-UAV trajectory is perfectly\nknown.",

We suggest that the mild\nconditions required for weak-strong uniqueness are, in fact, physically\nviolated by violent eruption of very thin boundary layers. We discuss\nobservational signatures of these extreme events and explain how the small\nlength-scales involved could threaten the validity of a hydrodynamic\ndescription.",

Previous studies in this area have been limited to\ngenerating a unique set of fashion items based on a given set of items, without\nproviding additional options to users. This lack of a diverse range of choices\nnecessitates the development of a more versatile framework. However, when the\ntask of generating collocated and diversified outfits is approached with\nmultimodal image-to-image translation methods, it poses a challenging problem\nin terms of non-aligned image translation, which is hard to address with\nexisting methods.

    "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have shown impressive results in\nreducing the number of trainable parameters and memory requirements of large\ntransformer networks while maintaining fine-tuning performance. The low-rank\nnature of the weight update inherently limits the representation power of\nfine-tuned models, however, thus potentially compromising performance on\ncomplex tasks. This raises a critical question: when a performance gap between\nLoRA and standard fine-tuning is observed, is it due to the reduced number of\ntrainable parameters or the rank deficiency? This paper aims to answer this\nquestion by introducing RandLoRA, a parameter-efficient method that performs\nfull-rank updates using a learned linear combinations of low-rank,\nnon-trainable random matrices. Our method limits the number of trainable\nparameters by restricting optimization to diagonal scaling matrices applied to\nthe fixed random matrices. This allows us to effectively overcome the low-rank\nlimitations while maintaining parameter and memory efficiency during training.\nThrough extensive experimentation across vision, language, and vision-language\nbenchmarks, we systematically evaluate the limitations of LoRA and existing\nrandom basis methods. Our findings reveal that full-rank updates are beneficial\nacross vision and language tasks individually, and even more so for\nvision-language tasks, where RandLoRA significantly reduces -- and sometimes\neliminates -- the performance gap between standard fine-tuning and LoRA,\ndemonstrating its efficacy.",

The dynamical fields are then integrated out in the background of the\nlow-momentum background fields. This strategy works well at tree level,\nallowing us to quickly derive QCD factorization formulas at leading order.\nHowever, to extend the approach to higher loops, it is necessary to rigorously\ndefine the functional integral over dynamical fields in an arbitrary background\nfield. This framework was carefully developed for the calculation of the\neffective action in a background field at the two-loop level in the classic\npaper by Abbott [1]. Building on this work, I specify the renormalized\nbackground-field Lagrangian and define the notion of the quantum average of an\noperator in a background field, consistent with the ``separation of scales''\nscheme mentioned earlier.

    "abstract": "The ability of tumors to evolve and adapt by developing subclones in\ndifferent genetic and epigenetic states is a major challenge in oncology.\nTraditional tools like multi-regional sequencing used to study tumor evolution\nand the resultant intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) are often impractical because\nof their resource-intensiveness and limited scalability. Here, we present\nMorphoITH, a novel framework that leverages histopathology slides to deconvolve\nmolecular ITH through tissue morphology. MorphoITH integrates a self-supervised\ndeep learning similarity measure to capture phenotypic variation across\nmultiple dimensions (cytology, architecture, and microenvironment) with\nrigorous methods to eliminate spurious sources of variation. Using a prototype\nof ITH, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), we show that MorphoITH\ncaptures clinically-significant biological features, such as vascular\narchitecture and nuclear grades. Furthermore, we find that MorphoITH recognizes\ndifferential biological states corresponding to subclonal changes in key driver\ngenes (BAP1/PBRM1/SETD2). Finally, by applying MorphoITH to a multi-regional\nsequencing experiment, we postulate evolutionary trajectories that largely\nrecapitulate genetic evolution. In summary, MorphoITH provides a scalable\nphenotypic lens that bridges the gap between histopathology and genomics,\nadvancing precision oncology.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical Merging is a technique commonly used to summarize very long\ntexts ($>$100K tokens) by breaking down the input into smaller sections,\nsummarizing those sections individually, and then merging or combining those\nsummaries into a final coherent summary. Although it helps address the\nlimitations of large language models (LLMs) with fixed input length\nconstraints, the recursive merging process can amplify LLM hallucinations,\nincreasing the risk of factual inaccuracies. In this paper, we seek to mitigate\nhallucinations by enriching hierarchical merging with context from the source\ndocument. Specifically, we propose different approaches to contextual\naugmentation ranging from \\emph{replacing} intermediate summaries with relevant\ninput context, to \\emph{refining} them while using the context as supporting\nevidence, and \\emph{aligning} them implicitly (via citations) to the input.\nExperimental results on datasets representing legal and narrative domains show\nthat contextual augmentation consistently outperforms zero-shot and\nhierarchical merging baselines for the Llama 3.1 model family.

In contrast, we show that base models without post-training,\nlargely untapped for synthetic data generation, offer substantially greater\noutput diversity, albeit with lower instruction following abilities. Leveraging\nthis insight, we propose Base-Refine (BARE), a novel two-stage method that\ncombines the diversity of base models with the quality assurance of\ninstruction-tuned models. BARE excels in few-shot synthetic data generation:\nusing only 3 seed examples it generates diverse, high-quality datasets that\nsignificantly improve downstream task performance. We show that fine-tuning\nLlama 3.1 8B with 1,000 BARE-generated samples achieves performance comparable\nto state-of-the-art similarly sized models on LiveCodeBench tasks. Furthermore,\ndata generated with BARE enables a 101% improvement for a fine-tuned Llama 3.2\n1B on GSM8K over data generated by only instruction-models, and an 18.4%\nimprovement for a fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B over the state-of-the-art RAFT method\nfor RAG data generation.",

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are crucial for scaling model capacity while\ncontrolling inference costs. While integrating MoE into multimodal models like\nCLIP improves performance, training these models is notoriously challenging and\nexpensive. We propose CLIP-Upcycling (CLIP-UP), an efficient alternative\ntraining strategy that converts a pre-trained dense CLIP model into a sparse\nMoE architecture. Through extensive experimentation with various settings and\nauxiliary losses, we demonstrate that CLIP-UP significantly reduces training\ncomplexity and cost. Remarkably, our sparse CLIP B/16 model, trained with\nCLIP-UP, outperforms its dense counterpart by 7.2% and 6.6% on COCO and\nFlickr30k text-to-image Recall@1 benchmarks respectively. It even surpasses the\nlarger CLIP L/14 model on this task while using only 30% of the inference\nFLOPs. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our training recipe\nacross different scales, establishing sparse upcycling as a practical and\nscalable approach for building efficient, high-performance CLIP models.",

This paper examines and criticizes the weaknesses and failures of SMA,\nsuch as instability, insensitivity to risk, superadditivity, and the implicit\nrelationship between the SMA capital model and systemic risk in the banking\nsector. Furthermore, it discusses the issues of the proposed Operational Risk\nCapital (OpCar) model by the Basel Committee, a precursor to SMA. The paper\nconcludes by advocating for the maintenance of the AMA internal model framework\nand suggests a series of standardization recommendations to unify internal\noperational risk modeling.
