    "abstract": "Although inspired by neuronal systems in the brain, artificial neural\nnetworks generally employ point-neurons, which offer far less computational\ncomplexity than their biological counterparts. Neurons have dendritic arbors\nthat connect to different sets of synapses and offer local non-linear\naccumulation - playing a pivotal role in processing and learning. Inspired by\nthis, we propose a novel neuron design based on a multi-gate ferroelectric\nfield-effect transistor that mimics dendrites. It leverages ferroelectric\nnonlinearity for local computations within dendritic branches, while utilizing\nthe transistor action to generate the final neuronal output. The branched\narchitecture paves the way for utilizing smaller crossbar arrays in hardware\nintegration, leading to greater efficiency. Using an experimentally calibrated\ndevice-circuit-algorithm co-simulation framework, we demonstrate that networks\nincorporating our dendritic neurons achieve superior performance in comparison\nto much larger networks without dendrites ($\\sim$17$\\times$ fewer trainable\nweight parameters). These findings suggest that dendritic hardware can\nsignificantly improve computational efficiency, and learning capacity of\nneuromorphic systems optimized for edge applications.",

Functional\nmodeling, a foundational aspect of this phase, enables designers to reason\nabout product functions before specific structural details are determined. A\nwidely adopted approach to functional modeling is the\nFunction-Behavior-Structure (FBS) framework, which supports the transformation\nof functional intent into behavioral and structural descriptions. However, the\neffectiveness of function-based design is often hindered by the lack of\nwell-structured and comprehensive functional data. This scarcity can negatively\nimpact early design decision-making and hinder the development of accurate\nbehavioral models. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as\nthose based on GPT architectures, offer a promising avenue to address this gap.\nLLMs have demonstrated significant capabilities in language understanding and\nnatural language processing (NLP), making them suitable for automated\nclassification tasks. This study proposes a novel LLM-based domain adaptation\n(DA) framework using fine-tuning for the automated classification of mechanical\nassembly parts' functions. By fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific datasets, the\ntraditionally manual and subjective process of function annotation can be\nimproved in both accuracy and consistency. A case study demonstrates\nfine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo on data from the Oregon State Design Repository\n(OSDR), and evaluation on the A Big CAD (ABC) dataset shows that the\ndomain-adapted LLM can generate high-quality functional data, enhancing the\nsemantic representation of mechanical parts and supporting more effective\ndesign exploration in early-phase engineering.",

Due to this inhomogeneous heat source, moist convection may\nbe more sensitive to changes in flow morphology, such as those induced by\nrotation, than dry Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection. In order to study the effects\nof rotation on flows driven by latent heat release, we present a suite of\nnumerical simulations that solve the Rainy-B\\'enard equations (Vallis et al.\n2019).

We measure energy fluxes through the\nsystem and report rotational scalings of the Reynolds and moist Nusselt\nnumbers.

In our study, we tested over 17 different\ntypes of commercially available filter media, including charged and uncharged\nsynthetic, as well as fiberglass media, from leading global manufacturers, to\nassess their efficiency in removing smoke, using pine needle smoke as a proxy\nfor wildfire smoke. Our findings revealed that charged polymer media, across\nall tested MERV grades, showed a rapid decline in smoke removal efficiency\nwithin minutes while causing no increase in airflow resistance. In contrast,\nmechanical media demonstrated more stable performance but experienced an\nincrease in airflow resistance. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we\nexamined smoke deposition on fiber media, revealing unique interactions that\ncontribute to the decline in filtration performance. These results suggest the\nneed to reconsider current standards - whose testing is centered around\ninorganic particle removal - and the applicability of their ratings to smoke\nfiltration. Our study also highlights the critical need to develop standard\ntesting methods and evaluation criteria specific to smoke particles in HVAC\nfilters to better protect human occupants during wildfire events.",

    "abstract": "We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 to study the galaxy\nmass-morphology relation, as measured by the rotational support of the stellar\ncomponent of simulated galaxies. For isolated galaxies with stellar mass in the\nrange $8<\\log(M_{*}/M_{\\odot}) < 11$, rotational support increases with $M_*$,\nfrom dispersion-supported spheroidal dwarfs to massive galaxies with prominent\nrotationally supported discs. Our results indicate that this correlation arises\nfrom the spatial distribution of star formation in TNG50 galaxies, which occurs\nprimarily in two distinct regions: an unresolved, non-rotating central baryonic\nclump $(r \\lesssim 1~\\mathrm{kpc})$ and a rotationally supported outer disc,\nseparated by a quiescent region. The importance of the inner clump increases\nwith decreasing $M_*$; it makes up more than 80\\% of all stars in dwarfs. This\nexplains why dwarfs have less rotational support than massive galaxies, as well\nas why all dwarfs have similar stellar half-mass radii regardless of $M_*$. It\nalso explains why dwarfs in TNG50 appear to form outside-in, as star formation\nin the dominant inner clump moves progressively inward. The clump-disc\nsegregation of star formation in TNG50 galaxies is probably numerical in\norigin. Inner clumps are formed by the accumulation of low-angular momentum gas\nsupported by the equation of state introduced to prevent artificial\nfragmentation. The decoupled-wind feedback implementation in TNG50 helps to\npreserve the clumps but disrupts disc formation in its immediate surroundings.\nThis hinders the formation of discs in (dwarf) galaxies whose sizes are not\nsubstantially larger than the clump, but has little effect on the larger discs\nof more massive systems. Our results argue for caution when interpreting the\ndependence on stellar mass of TNG50 galaxy morphologies, or the evolution of\ngalaxy sizes, especially at the dwarf end.",

    "abstract": "Neutron star (NS) mergers, including both binary NS mergers and black hole -\nNS mergers, are multi-messenger sources detectable in both gravitational waves\n(GWs) and electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The expected EM emission signatures\ndepend on the source's progenitor, merger remnant, and observer's line of sight\n(LoS). Widely discussed EM counterparts of NS mergers have been focused in the\ngamma-ray (in terms of short-duration gamma-ray bursts) and optical (in terms\nof kilonova) bands. In this paper, we show that X-ray emission carries unique\npost-merger signatures that are inaccessible in other EM bands and plays an\nimportant role in understanding the physics and geometry of these mergers. We\nconsider several binary progenitor and central engine models and investigate\nX-ray emission signatures from the prompt phase immediately after the merger to\nthe afterglow phase extending years later. For the prompt phase, we devise a\ngeneral method for computing phenomenological X-ray light curves and spectra\nfor structured jets viewed from any LoS, which can be applied to X-ray\nobservations of NS mergers to constrain the geometry. The geometric constraints\ncan in turn be used to model the afterglow and estimate a peak time and flux --\nto preemptively determine afterglow characteristics would be monumental for\nfollow-up observation campaigns of future GW sources. Finally, we provide\nconstraints on the time window for X-ray counterpart searches of NS mergers\nacross a range of luminosity distances and detector sensitivities.",

However, even\nserverless platforms -- which boot sandboxes in 10s to 100s of milliseconds --\nare not sufficiently elastic to avoid over-provisioning expensive resources.\nToday's FaaS platforms rely on pre-provisioning many idle sandboxes in memory\nto reduce the occurrence of slow, cold starts. A key obstacle for high\nelasticity is booting a guest OS and configuring features like networking in\nsandboxes, which are required to expose an isolated POSIX-like interface to\nuser functions. Our key insight is that redesigning the interface for\napplications in the cloud-native era enables co-designing a much more efficient\nand elastic execution system. Now is a good time to rethink cloud abstractions\nas developers are building applications to be cloud-native. Cloud-native\napplications typically consist of user-provided compute logic interacting with\ncloud services (for storage, AI inference, query processing, etc) exposed over\nREST APIs. Hence, we propose Dandelion, an elastic cloud platform with a\ndeclarative programming model that expresses applications as DAGs of pure\ncompute functions and higher-level communication functions. Dandelion can\nsecurely execute untrusted user compute functions in lightweight sandboxes that\ncold start in hundreds of microseconds, since pure functions do not rely on\nextra software environments such as a guest OS.

A 6:1 prolate\nspheroid of diameter $D$ with velocity $U$ and at a moderate angle of attack\n(AOA) of $10^\\circ$ is taken as a canonical example of a submersible. Buoyancy\neffects are examined in a parametric LES study of the spheroid wake at $Re =\nUD/\\nu = 5000$ where stratification is changed to cover a wide range of values\nof body Froude number ($Fr = U/ND$). The Froude number measures buoyancy time\nscale (1/$N$ where $N$ is the buoyancy frequency) relative to flow time scale\n($D/U$). The simulated cases range from a baseline case without stratification,\ni.e. $Fr = \\infty$, to the substantial stratification level of $Fr = 1$. The\nvery near wake, just two body diameters aft of the trailing edge, is found to\nbe substantially altered at even the relatively weak stratification of $Fr =\n6$. Specifically, the coherence of the streamwise vortex pair shed from the\nbody is weakened, the downward trajectory of the wake center is suppressed, and\nthe mean/turbulence structure changes in the near wake. Diagnosis of the\nvorticity transport equation reveals that the baroclinic torque becomes an\nimportant contributor to the balance of mean streamwise vorticity in the very\nnear wake at $Fr = 6$.

    "abstract": "Bilateralism is the position according to which assertion and rejection are\nconceptually independent speech acts. Logical bilateralism demands that systems\nof logic provide conditions for assertion and rejection that are not reducible\nto each other, which often leads to independent definitions of proof rules (for\nassertion) and dual proof rules, also called refutation rules (for rejection).\nSince it provides a critical account of what it means for something to be a\nproof or a refutation, bilateralism is often studied in the context of\nproof-theoretic semantics, an approach that aims to elucidate both the meaning\nof proofs (and refutations) and what kinds of semantics can be given if proofs\n(and refutations) are considered as basic semantic notions. The recent\nliterature on bilateral proof-theoretic semantics has only dealt with the\nsemantics of proofs and refutations, whereas we deal with semantics in terms of\nproofs and refutations. In this paper we present a bilateral version of\nbase-extension semantics - one of the most widely studied proof-theoretic\nsemantics - by allowing atomic bases to contain both atomic proof rules and\natomic refutation rules. The semantics is shown to be sound and complete with\nrespect to the bilateral dual intuitionistic logic 2Int. Structural\nsimilarities between atomic proofs and refutations also allow us to define\nduality notions for atomic rules, deductions and bases, which may then be used\nfor the proof of bilateral semantic harmony results. Aside from enabling\nembeddings between different fragments of the language, bilateral semantic\nharmony is shown to be a restatement of the syntactic horizontal inversion\nprinciple, whose meaning-conferring character may now be interpreted as the\nrequirement of preservation of harmony notions already present at the core of\nthe semantics by inferences.",

    "abstract": "The promise of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) has led to an\nabundance of public quantum mechanical (QM) training datasets. The quality of\nan MLIP is directly limited by the accuracy of the energies and atomic forces\nin the training dataset. Unfortunately, most of these datasets are computed\nwith relatively low-accuracy QM methods, e.g., density functional theory with a\nmoderate basis set. Due to the increased computational cost of more accurate QM\nmethods, e.g., coupled-cluster theory with a complete basis set extrapolation,\nmost high-accuracy datasets are much smaller and often do not contain atomic\nforces. The lack of high-accuracy atomic forces is quite troubling, as training\nwith force data greatly improves the stability and quality of the MLIP compared\nto training to energy alone. Because most datasets are computed with a unique\nlevel of theory, traditional single-fidelity learning is not capable of\nleveraging the vast amounts of published QM data. In this study, we apply\nmulti-fidelity learning to train an MLIP to multiple QM datasets of different\nlevels of accuracy, i.e., levels of fidelity. Specifically, we perform three\ntest cases to demonstrate that multi-fidelity learning with both low-level\nforces and high-level energies yields an extremely accurate MLIP -- far more\naccurate than a single-fidelity MLIP trained solely to high-level energies and\nalmost as accurate as a single-fidelity MLIP trained directly to high-level\nenergies and forces. Therefore, multi-fidelity learning greatly alleviates the\nneed for generating large and expensive datasets containing high-accuracy\natomic forces and allows for more effective training to existing high-accuracy\nenergy-only datasets. Indeed, low-accuracy atomic forces and high-accuracy\nenergies are all that are needed to achieve a high-accuracy MLIP with\nmulti-fidelity learning.",

Recent approaches\nusing the Affine Geometric Heat Flow (AGHF) Partial Differential Equation (PDE)\nhave demonstrated promising results, generating dynamically feasible\ntrajectories for complex systems like the Digit V3 humanoid within seconds.\nThese methods efficiently solve trajectory optimization problems over a\ntwo-dimensional domain by evolving an initial trajectory to minimize control\neffort. However, these AGHF approaches are limited to a single type of optimal\ncontrol problem (i.e., minimizing the integral of squared control norms) and\ntypically require initial guesses that satisfy constraints to ensure\nsatisfactory convergence. These limitations restrict the potential utility of\nthe AGHF PDE especially when trying to synthesize trajectories for robotic\nsystems. This paper generalizes the AGHF formulation to accommodate arbitrary\ncost functions, significantly expanding the classes of trajectories that can be\ngenerated.

We measure halo shapes and orientations using different\nline-of-sight projection depths and find that, with modest projection depths,\nthe shapes and orientations recovered by SHAPE show good agreement with those\nmeasured directly from the simulation particles. Using these SHAPE-derived\nshapes, we compute IA correlation functions from N-body simulations in both\nreal and redshift space. The IA correlation multipoles exhibit features\nconsistent with baryon acoustic oscillations around 100 Mpc/h and show\nredshift-space distortion (RSD) effects that agree well with predictions from a\nnon-linear alignment model incorporating RSD. We further demonstrate that the\nstructure growth rate parameter can be robustly estimated without bias from\nthese IA correlations, providing a new avenue for cosmological parameter\nestimation. Expanding the IA correlations in an associated Legendre basis\nyields results consistent with those from the standard Legendre expansion, but\nwith improved statistical significance.

    "abstract": "The sub-Jovian exoplanet WASP-107b ranks among the best-characterized\nlow-density worlds, featuring a Jupiter-like radius and a mass that lies firmly\nin the sub-Saturn range. Recently obtained JWST spectra reveal significant\nmethane depletion in the atmosphere, indicating that WASP-107b's envelope has\nboth a high metallicity and an elevated internal heat flux. Together with a\ndetected non-zero orbital eccentricity, these data have been interpreted as\nevidence of tidal heating. However, explaining the observed luminosity with\ntidal dissipation requires an unusually low tidal quality factor of $Q \\sim\n100$. Moreover, we find that secular excitation by the RV-detected outer\ncompanion WASP-107c, generally cannot sustain WASP-107b's eccentricity in\nsteady state against tidal circularization. As an alternative explanation, we\npropose that Ohmic dissipation -- generated by interactions between zonal flows\nand the planetary magnetic field in a partially ionized atmosphere -- maintains\nthe observed thermal state. Under nominal assumptions for the field strength,\natmospheric circulation, and ionization chemistry, we show that Ohmic heating\nreadily accounts for WASP-107b's inflated radius and anomalously large internal\nentropy.",

Multiple fields -- notably AI Safety, AI\nAlignment, and Machine Ethics -- claim to contribute to this task. However, the\nconceptual boundaries and interrelations among these domains remain vague,\nleaving researchers without clear guidance in positioning their work.\n  To address this meta-challenge, we develop a structured conceptual framework\nfor understanding AI alignment. Rather than focusing solely on alignment goals,\nwe introduce a taxonomy distinguishing the alignment aim (safety, ethicality,\nlegality, etc.), scope (outcome vs. execution), and constituency (individual\nvs. collective). This structural approach reveals multiple legitimate alignment\nconfigurations, providing a foundation for practical and philosophical\nintegration across domains, and clarifying what it might mean for an agent to\nbe aligned all-things-considered.",

They are compared with standard\nTransformer models and encoder-only Transformer models in three periods\ncovering the entire COVID-19 pandemic to examine the model adaptivity and\nsuitability during the extreme market fluctuations. Namely, pre-COVID-19 period\n(mild up-trend), COVID-19 period (sharp up-trend with deep down shock) and\n1-year post-COVID-19 (high fluctuation sideways movement). The best proposed\nSERT model achieves the highest out-of-sample R2, 11.2% and 10.91%\nrespectively, when extreme market fluctuation takes place followed by\npre-trained Transformer models (10.38% and 9.15%). Their Trend-following-based\nstrategy wise performance also proves their excellent capability for hedging\ndownside risks during market shocks. The proposed SERT model achieves a Sortino\nratio 47% higher than the buy-and-hold benchmark in the equal-weighted\nportfolio and 28% higher in the value-weighted portfolio when the pandemic\nperiod is attended. It proves that Transformer models have a great capability\nto capture patterns of temporal sparsity data in the asset pricing factor\nmodel, especially with considerable volatilities. We also find the softmax\nsignal filter as the common configuration of Transformer models in alternative\ncontexts, which only eliminates differences between models, but does not\nimprove strategy-wise performance, while increasing attention heads improve the\nmodel performance insignificantly and applying the 'layer norm first' method do\nnot boost the model performance in our case.",

The new data\ncan alternatively be well fit with a dust mass of 0.4 M(Sun) and a much reduced\nheating source luminosity. The new late-time spectra show unusually strong\noxygen forbidden lines, stronger than the H-alpha emission. This indicates that\nSN 1995N may have exploded as a stripped-envelope SN which then interacted with\na massive H-rich circumstellar shell, changing it from intrinsically Type Ib/c\nto Type IIn. The late-time spectrum results when the reverse shock begins to\nexcite the inner H-poor, O-rich ejecta.

We then enhanced the ACID tool,\noriginally developed for the prior study, to automatically classify and analyze\ndefect distributions across an expanded dataset-447 open-source repositories\nand 94 proprietary projects from VTEX (e-commerce) and Nubank (financial).\nResults: Our research confirmed the same eight defect categories identified in\nthe original study, with idempotency and security defects appearing\ninfrequently but persistently across projects. Configuration Data defects\nmaintain high frequency in both open-source and proprietary codebases.\nConclusions: Our replication supports the generalizability of the original\ntaxonomy, suggesting IaC development challenges surpass organizational\nboundaries. Configuration Data defects emerge as a persistent high-frequency\nproblem, while idempotency and security defects remain important concerns\ndespite lower frequency. These patterns appear consistent across open-source\nand proprietary projects, indicating they are fundamental to the IaC paradigm\nitself, transcending specific tools or project types.",

However, these new applications\nrequire more than evaluations of final solution generation. We introduce\nTutorGym to evaluate these applications more directly. TutorGym is a standard\ninterface for testing artificial intelligence (AI) agents within existing\nintelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that have been tested and refined in\nclassroom studies, including Cognitive Tutors (CTAT), Apprentice Tutors, and\nOATutors. TutorGym is more than a simple problem-solution benchmark, it\nsituates AI agents within the interactive interfaces of existing ITSs. At each\nstep of problem-solving, AI agents are asked what they would do as a tutor or\nas a learner. As tutors, AI agents are prompted to provide tutoring support --\nsuch as generating examples, hints, and step-level correctness feedback --\nwhich can be evaluated directly against the adaptive step-by-step support\nprovided by existing ITSs. As students, agents directly learn from ITS\ninstruction, and their mistakes and learning trajectories can be compared to\nstudent data. TutorGym establishes a common framework for training and\nevaluating diverse AI agents, including LLMs, computational models of learning,\nand reinforcement learning agents, within a growing suite of learning\nenvironments. Currently, TutorGym includes 223 different tutor domains. In an\ninitial evaluation, we find that current LLMs are poor at tutoring -- none did\nbetter than chance at labeling incorrect actions, and next-step actions were\ncorrect only ~52-70% of the time -- but they could produce remarkably\nhuman-like learning curves when trained as students with in-context learning.",

Critical spin fluctuations represented by a\nbosonic field compete with itinerant electrons to couple with the impurity\nthrough the spin-spin interaction. At long distances, the antiferromagnetic\nelectron-impurity (Kondo) coupling dominates over the boson-impurity coupling.\nHowever, the Kondo screening is weakened by the boson with an increasing\nseverity as the hot spots connected by the magnetic ordering wave-vector are\nbetter nested. For $v_{0,i} \\ll 1$, where $v_{0,i}$ is the bare nesting angle\nat the hot spots, the temperature $T_K^{\\mathrm{AFQCM}}$ below which Kondo\ncoupling becomes $O(1)$ is suppressed as $\\frac{\\log\n\\Lambda/T_K^{\\mathrm{AFQCM}}}{\\log \\Lambda/T_K^{\\mathrm{FL}}} \\sim\n\\frac{g_{f,i}}{v_{0,i} \\log 1/v_{0,i} }$, where $T_K^{\\mathrm{FL}}$ is the\nKondo temperature of the Fermi liquid with the same electronic density of\nstates, and $g_{f,i}$ is the boson-impurity coupling defined at UV cutoff\nenergy $\\Lambda$.

Specifically, we show\nthat many popular methods aim to approximate the top-d singular functions of\nthe expectation operator induced by the context, in which case we say that the\nrepresentation learns the contexture. We demonstrate the generality of the\ncontexture theory by proving that representation learning within various\nlearning paradigms -- supervised, self-supervised, and manifold learning -- can\nall be studied from such a perspective. We also prove that the representations\nthat learn the contexture are optimal on those tasks that are compatible with\nthe context. One important implication of the contexture theory is that once\nthe model is large enough to approximate the top singular functions, further\nscaling up the model size yields diminishing returns. Therefore, scaling is not\nall we need, and further improvement requires better contexts. To this end, we\nstudy how to evaluate the usefulness of a context without knowing the\ndownstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Following the death of Pope Francis, the College of Cardinals will convene in\nconclave to elect the new Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church.\n  In this report, we present a computational framework for analyzing the\nideological landscape of the cardinal electors and estimating the likely\noutcomes of the upcoming papal election. We collected public textual data\ndescribing each cardinal's positions on a range of topics currently relevant to\nthe Church, including sexuality, migration, poverty, governance and\ninterreligious dialogue. These texts were embedded using a transformer-based\nlanguage model to construct a semantic similarity matrix among cardinals. We\nthen simulated conclave voting dynamics using this matrix as a proxy for\nideological proximity. The model produced both topic-conditioned and aggregate\nprobabilistic forecasts of election outcomes. We report the predicted leading\ncandidates under various scenarios and discuss the structure of factional\nclustering revealed by the embeddings.\n  The results highlight a polarized field with a small number of structurally\ncentral candidates, among whom Pietro Parolin, the former secretary of state,\nconsistently emerges as the most broadly electable across thematic scenarios,\nfollowed by both high-profile and outsider names such as card.

In nuclear\ninspection, robots can be crucial in assessing environments where human\npresence is limited, requiring precise teleoperation and coordination.\nTeleoperation requires extensive training, as operators must process multiple\noutputs while ensuring safe interaction with critical assets. These challenges\nare amplified when operating a fleet of heterogeneous robots across multiple\nenvironments, as each robot may have distinct control interfaces, sensory\nsystems, and operational constraints. Efficient coordination in such settings\nremains an open problem.

    "abstract": "Vocal responses from caregivers are believed to promote more frequent and\nmore advanced infant vocalizations. However, studies that examine this\nrelationship typically do not account for the fact that infant and adult\nvocalizations are distributed in hierarchical clusters over the course of the\nday. These bursts and lulls create a challenge for accurately detecting the\neffects of adult input at immediate turn-by-turn timescales within real-world\nbehavior, as adult responses tend to happen during already occurring bursts of\ninfant vocalizations. Analyzing daylong audio recordings of real-world vocal\ncommunication between human infants (ages 3, 6, 9, and 18 months) and their\nadult caregivers, we first show that both infant and caregiver vocalization\nevents are clustered in time, as evidenced by positive correlations between\nsuccessive inter-event intervals (IEIs). We propose an approach informed by\nflight time analyses in foraging studies to assess whether the timing of a\nvocal agent's next vocalization is modified by inputs from another vocal agent,\ncontrolling for the first agent's previous IEI. For both infants and adults,\nreceiving a social response predicts that the individual will vocalize again\nsooner than they would have in the absence of a response. Overall, our results\nare consistent with a view of infant-caregiver vocal interactions as an\n'interpersonal foraging' process with inherent multi-scale dynamics wherein\nsocial responses are among the resources the individuals are foraging for. The\nanalytic approaches introduced here have broad utility to study communication\nin other modalities, contexts, and species.",

    "abstract": "Time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy provides a unique and direct way to\nexplore the real-time nonequilibrium dynamics of electrons and holes. The\nformal theory of the spectral function evolution requires inclusion of\nelectronic correlations and dissipation, which are challenging due to the\nassociated long simulation timescales which translate to a high computational\ncost. Recent methodological developments, namely the Real-Time Dyson Expansion,\nas well as theoretical developments of many-body perturbation theory for\ndissipative systems, have allowed for the study of driven-dissipative\ninteracting quantum systems. In this work, we implement the hitherto unrealized\nstudy of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems which includes driven\ndynamical correlations and utilizes these new methods and perturbative\nexpansions. We illustrate the combined formalism on a prototypical two-band\nsemiconductor model with long-range density-density Coulomb interactions. We\nshow that the intraband thermalization of conduction band electrons induces\nnontrivial time-dependent changes in the system's bandstructure and a\ntime-evolving band-gap renormalization (with a reduction by up to 10\\%). We\nshow that the qualitative features are preserved for a variety of parameters,\ndiscuss the corresponding spectral dynamics, and provide an outlook on the\nnewly introduced simulation framework, which enables treating electron-electron\nscattering and dissipation effects on equal footing.",

In this study, we illustrate the approach on the basis of\nwitness testimony, focusing on the underlying argument attack structure.

    "abstract": "As vector databases gain traction in enterprise applications, robust access\ncontrol has become critical to safeguard sensitive data. Access control in\nthese systems is often implemented through hybrid vector queries, which combine\nnearest neighbor search on vector data with relational predicates based on user\npermissions. However, existing approaches face significant trade-offs: creating\ndedicated indexes for each user minimizes query latency but introduces\nexcessive storage redundancy, while building a single index and applying access\ncontrol after vector search reduces storage overhead but suffers from poor\nrecall and increased query latency. This paper introduces HoneyBee, a dynamic\npartitioning framework that bridges the gap between these approaches by\nleveraging the structure of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies. RBAC,\nwidely adopted in enterprise settings, groups users into roles and assigns\npermissions to those roles, creating a natural \"thin waist\" in the permission\nstructure that is ideal for partitioning decisions. Specifically, HoneyBee\nproduces overlapping partitions where vectors can be strategically replicated\nacross different partitions to reduce query latency while controlling storage\noverhead. By introducing analytical models for the performance and recall of\nthe vector search, HoneyBee formulates the partitioning strategy as a\nconstrained optimization problem to dynamically balance storage, query\nefficiency, and recall. Evaluations on RBAC workloads demonstrate that HoneyBee\nreduces storage redundancy compared to role partitioning and achieves up to 6x\nfaster query speeds than row-level security (RLS) with only 1.4x storage\nincrease, offering a practical middle ground for secure and efficient vector\nsearch.",

We explore\nthe evolution of the mean position of the quantum walker, denoted as\n$\\overline{X}(t)$, under various initial conditions of the walker and quantum\ncoin operators. The results indicate a significant dependence of the observed\nphenomena on the choice of initial state, enabling the selective induction of\nthe quantum boomerang effect in both or only one portion of the wavepacket\nassociated with specific internal states.

    "abstract": "We consider stochastic differential games with a large number of players,\nwith the aim of quantifying the gap between closed-loop, open-loop and\ndistributed equilibria. We show that, under two different semi-monotonicity\nconditions, the equilibrium trajectories are close when the interactions\nbetween the players are weak. Our approach is non-asymptotic in nature, in the\nsense that it does not make use of any a priori identification of a limiting\nmodel, like in mean field game (MFG) theory. The main technical step is to\nderive bounds on solutions to systems of PDE/FBSDE characterizing the\nequilibria that are independent of the number of players. When specialized to\nthe mean field setting, our estimates yield quantitative convergence results\nfor both open-loop and closed-loop equilibria without any use of the master\nequation. In fact, our main bounds hold for games in which interactions are\nmuch sparser than those of MFGs, and so we can also obtain some \"universality\"\nresults for MFGs, in which we show that games governed by dense enough networks\nconverge to the usual MFG limit. Finally, we use our estimates to study a joint\nvanishing viscosity and large population limit in the setting of displacement\nmonotone games without idiosyncratic noise.",

Though Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are\nwidely considered the gold standard for empirically assessing the privacy of a\nsynthetic dataset, practitioners and researchers often rely on simpler proxy\nmetrics such as Distance to Closest Record (DCR). These metrics estimate\nprivacy by measuring the similarity between the training data and generated\nsynthetic data. This similarity is also compared against that between the\ntraining data and a disjoint holdout set of real records to construct a binary\nprivacy test. If the synthetic data is not more similar to the training data\nthan the holdout set is, it passes the test and is considered private. In this\nwork we show that, while computationally inexpensive, DCR and other\ndistance-based metrics fail to identify privacy leakage. Across multiple\ndatasets and both classical models such as Baynet and CTGAN and more recent\ndiffusion models, we show that datasets deemed private by proxy metrics are\nhighly vulnerable to MIAs. We similarly find both the binary privacy test and\nthe continuous measure based on these metrics to be uninformative of actual\nmembership inference risk. We further show that these failures are consistent\nacross different metric hyperparameter settings and record selection methods.\nFinally, we argue DCR and other distance-based metrics to be flawed by design\nand show a example of a simple leakage they miss in practice. With this work,\nwe hope to motivate practitioners to move away from proxy metrics to MIAs as\nthe rigorous, comprehensive standard of evaluating privacy of synthetic data,\nin particular to make claims of datasets being legally anonymous.",

Adversary\nmodeling is an important capability in cybersecurity that lets defenders\ncharacterize behaviors of potential attackers, which enables attribution to\nknown cyber adversary groups. Existing approaches rely on documenting an\never-evolving set of attacker tools and techniques to track known threat\nactors. Although attacks evolve constantly, attacker behavioral preferences are\nintrinsic and less volatile. Our approach learns the behavioral preferences of\ncyber adversaries from forensics data on their tools and techniques. We model\nthe attacker as an expert decision-making agent with unknown behavioral\npreferences situated in a computer host. We leverage attack provenance graphs\nof audit logs to derive a state-action trajectory of the attack. We test our\napproach on open datasets of audit logs containing real attack data. Our\nresults demonstrate for the first time that low-level forensics data can\nautomatically reveal an adversary's subjective preferences, which serves as an\nadditional dimension to modeling and documenting cyber adversaries. Attackers'\npreferences tend to be invariant despite their different tools and indicate\npredispositions that are inherent to the attacker.

Cryptochrome's molecular chirality has been\nhypothesized to enhance magnetic field effects via the chirality-induced spin\nselectivity (CISS) effect, yet the mechanism underlying this enhancement\nremains unresolved. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of\nCISS on the directional magnetic sensitivity of prototypical radical pair\nreactions, analyzing two distinct models--one generating spin polarization and,\nfor the first time, one generating coherence. We find that CISS-induced spin\npolarization significantly enhances magnetic sensitivity by introducing triplet\ncharacter into the initial state and reinforcing the quantum Zeno effect,\nparalleling enhancements observed in triplet-born radical pairs subject to\nstrongly asymmetric recombination. In contrast, CISS-generated spin coherence\ndoes not provide a significant improvement in sensitivity. These findings\nindicate that CISS is not itself a universal enhancer of sensitivity or\ncoherence in radical-pair reactions, and its influence must be evaluated case\nby case, particularly in relation to the quantum Zeno effect. Additionally, we\nprovide a unified interpolation scheme for modeling CISS-influenced initial\nstates and recombination dynamics, encompassing the principal models currently\ndiscussed in the literature for singlet and triplet precursors.",

We also show that if\nmultiple bits flip within a byte, we can probabilistically model the likelihood\nof flipped bits appearing adjacently.

Second, we introduce a\ntargeted attack against large language models by exploiting Rowhammer-induced\ncorruptions in tokenizer dictionaries of GGUF model files.

Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states,\nwe develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the\ninteraction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control\ncan increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between\ncompeting spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach\nbeyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns\nthrough a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our\nmethod across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the\ninherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a\nversatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological\nphases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.",

JWST is revealing potential biosignatures in exoplanet atmospheres,\nthough their presence is yet to provide strong evidence for life. The central\nchallenge is attribution: how to confidently identify biogenic sources while\nruling out, or deeming unlikely, abiotic explanations? Attribution is\nparticularly difficult for individual planets, especially regarding\nsystem-scale stochastic processes that could set atmospheric conditions. To\naddress this, we here propose a comparative multi-planet approach: comparing\natmospheric compositions across multiple planets within a system to empirically\ndefine the 'abiotic baseline'. This baseline serves as a reference point for\nbiosignatures, and enables marginalisation over inaccessible, shared abiotic\nparameters. This is possible because planets within a system are linked by\ntheir birth in the same natal disk, having been irradiated by the same evolving\nstar, and having a related dynamical history. Observations aligning with the\nabiotic baseline, where the locally informed abiotic models demonstrate high\nout-of-sample predictive accuracy, are likely non-biological. Deviations from\nthe baseline -- potentially biotic anomalies -- suggest an alternative origin.\nWe present the application of Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation to\nevaluate the performance of geochemical- and biogeochemical-climate models in\nexplaining these anomalies, using the expected log pointwise predictive density\nas a diagnostic. When biogeochemical models outperform their abiotic\ncounterparts, the anomaly may be shaped by life, and constitutes a comparative\nbiosignature. If both models perform poorly, the anomaly is flagged as an\n\"unknown unknown\" -- a signature of either unrecognised abiotic chemistry, or\nlife as we don't yet know it.",

Loop models are an extension of this idea, with the constraint that two\ndimers must touch at each site. Here, we present a further generalization where\nevery site must have three dimers attached -- a trivalent network model. As\nconcrete physical realizations, we discuss d$^3$ transition metal\ndichalcogenides in the 1T structure -- materials with the structural formula\nMX$_2$ (M = Tc, Re) or AM$'$X$_2$ (A = Li or Na; M$'$ = Mo, W), where X is a\nchalcogen atom. These materials have a triangular layer of transition metal\natoms, each with three valence electrons in $t_{2g}$ orbitals. Each atom forms\nvalence bonds with three of its nearest neighbours. The geometry of the 1T\nstructure imbues each bond with sharp orbital character. We argue that this\nenforces a ``bending constraint'' so that two dimers attached to the same site\ncannot be parallel. This leads to a highly structured space of configurations,\nwith alternating bonds along each line of the underlying triangular lattice.\nThere is no dynamics, as constraints forbid local rearrangements of dimers. We\nconstruct a phase diagram, identifying configurations that minimize potential\nenergy. We find a rhombus-stripe phase that explains a distortion pattern seen\nacross several materials. Remarkably, the local constraints in this model lead\nto a simple example of holography. The bonding configuration in the bulk is\ncompletely determined by the configuration at the boundary. We recast the model\nin terms of three Ising chains that are defined on the boundaries of a\ntriangular cluster. As a testable prediction, we propose that a single impurity\nwill generate long-ranged domain walls.",

    "abstract": "Galaxy groups and clusters are among the best probes of structure formation\nand growth in a cosmological context. Most of their baryonic component is\ndominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), whose thermodynamical properties\nserve as indicators of the halo's dynamical state and can be used for the halo\nmass determination in the self-similar scenario. However, baryonic processes,\nsuch as AGN feedback and gas cooling, may affect the global properties of the\nICM, especially in the group regime. These effects might lead to deviations\nfrom self-similar predictions in galaxy groups' scaling relations, while they\nremain in place for massive galaxy clusters. Additionally, the low-mass end of\nthe scaling relations, ranging from $10^{13}$ to $10^{14} M_\\odot$, remains\nunclear and poorly populated, as current X-ray surveys detect only the\nbrightest groups. Here, we present the Mass-Temperature relation across the\nfull mass range, from massive clusters to low-mass groups ($10^{13}M_\\odot$),\nas observed by eROSITA. Using spectral stacking from eROSITA eRASS1 data for\noptically selected galaxy groups, we find that, in the lower mass range, galaxy\ngroups follow the power-law relation known for galaxy clusters. We further\nvalidate these results by conducting the same stacking procedure on mock\neRASS:4 data using the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation. This indicates\nthat AGN feedback is more likely to affect the distribution of baryons in the\nintragroup medium rather than the overall halo gas temperature. No significant\nchanges in the Mass-Temperature relation slope suggest that temperature can\nserve as a reliable mass proxy across the entire mass range. This validates the\nuse of temperature-derived masses, particularly in cosmological studies,\nsignificantly broadening the mass range and enabling applications such as\nimproving the cluster mass function studies and cosmological parameter\nestimate.",

We consider the effects on the solar\nstructure arising from a general class of macroscopic dark matter candidates\nthat include strange quark matter, compact dark objects, and others. We\ncalibrate standard solar evolution models (i.e., models that reproduce the\nmass, luminosity, radius, and metallicity of the Sun at its present age) with\nvariable compact dark core masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to\n$10^{-2}~\\rm{M}_\\odot$ and assess their properties.\n  We find that the weakest constraints come from solar neutrino flux\nmeasurements, which only rule out the most massive dark core comprising at\nleast $\\sim 1\\%$ of the total solar mass. The Sun's acoustic oscillations\nimpose stronger constraints, probing masses down to $\\sim\n10^{-5}~\\rm{M}_\\odot$. We find that a model with a $10^{-3}~\\rm{M}_\\odot$ dark\ncore appears to improve the agreement with helioseismic observations. We\nnevertheless caution against interpreting this as evidence for dark matter in\nthe solar interior, and suggest plausible effects that the dark core may\ninstead be emulating.

The dynamical interactions of compact objects in\nN-body clusters is of great interest for the formation of black holes in the\nupper mass gap as well as intermediate and supermassive black holes. These are\npotential sources of gravitational waves that may be detected by both current\nand future observatories. Unlike previous N-body Newtonian and post-Newtonian\nsimulations, no \"subgrid physics\" is required to handle collisions and mergers.\nWe can therefore confirm in full general relativity several predictions from\nthese simulations and analytic estimates: the runaway growth of a large black\nhole via repeated mergers; spindown of the central black hole with increasing\ncaptures; the ejection of a black hole with a large asymptotic velocity due to\na several-body interaction; and a regime where mergers occur primarily via\ndirect collisions on highly eccentric orbits instead of quasicircular\ninspirals.

Arguably the most natural\nalgorithm is gradient-descent-ascent (GDA). However, since the 1970s,\nconventional wisdom has argued that GDA fails to converge even on simple\nproblems. This failure spurred an extensive literature on modifying GDA with\nadditional building blocks such as extragradients, optimism, momentum,\nanchoring, etc. In contrast, we show that GDA converges in its original form by\nsimply using a judicious choice of stepsizes.\n  The key innovation is the proposal of unconventional stepsize schedules\n(dubbed slingshot stepsize schedules) that are time-varying, asymmetric, and\nperiodically negative. We show that all three properties are necessary for\nconvergence, and that altogether this enables GDA to converge on the classical\ncounterexamples (e.g., unconstrained convex-concave problems). All of our\nresults apply to the last iterate of GDA, as is typically desired in practice.\n  The core algorithmic intuition is that although negative stepsizes make\nbackward progress, they de-synchronize the min and max variables (overcoming\nthe cycling issue of GDA), and lead to a slingshot phenomenon in which the\nforward progress in the other iterations is overwhelmingly larger. This results\nin fast overall convergence. Geometrically, the slingshot dynamics leverage the\nnon-reversibility of gradient flow: positive/negative steps cancel to first\norder, yielding a second-order net movement in a new direction that leads to\nconvergence and is otherwise impossible for GDA to move in. We interpret this\nas a second-order finite-differencing algorithm and show that, intriguingly, it\napproximately implements consensus optimization, an empirically popular\nalgorithm for min-max problems involving deep neural networks (e.g., training\nGANs).",

We find a negative answer\nwith far-reaching consequences: new degrees of freedom beyond gravity and the\nStandard Model are necessary to give neutrinos a mass in the asymptotic-safety\nparadigm. Second, we explore whether the type-I Seesaw mechanism is viable and\ndiscover an upper bound on the Seesaw scale. The bound depends on the mass of\nthe visible neutrino. We find a numerical value of $10^{14}\\, \\rm GeV$ for this\nbound when neglecting neutrino mixing for a visible mass of $10^{-10}\\, \\rm\nGeV$. Conversely, for the most ``natural\" value of the Seesaw scale in a\nquantum-gravity setting, which is the Planck scale, we predict an upper bound\nfor the neutrino mass of the visible neutrino of approximately $10^{-15}\\, \\rm\nGeV$. Third, we explore whether neutrinos could also be Pseudo-Dirac-neutrinos\nin asymptotic safety and find that this possibility can be accommodated.",

    "abstract": "We study the evolution of the bar fraction in disc galaxies between $0.5 < z\n< 4.0$ using multi-band coloured images from JWST CEERS. These images were\nclassified by citizen scientists in a new phase of the Galaxy Zoo project\ncalled GZ CEERS. Citizen scientists were asked whether a strong or weak bar was\nvisible in the host galaxy. After considering multiple corrections for\nobservational biases, we find that the bar fraction decreases with redshift in\nour volume-limited sample (n = 398); from $25^{+6}_{-4}$% at $0.5 < z < 1.0$ to\n$3^{+6}_{-1}$% at $3.0 < z < 4.0$. However, we argue it is appropriate to\ninterpret these fractions as lower limits. Disentangling real changes in the\nbar fraction from detection biases remains challenging. Nevertheless, we find a\nsignificant number of bars up to $z = 2.5$. This implies that discs are\ndynamically cool or baryon-dominated, enabling them to host bars. This also\nsuggests that bar-driven secular evolution likely plays an important role at\nhigher redshifts. When we distinguish between strong and weak bars, we find\nthat the weak bar fraction decreases with increasing redshift. In contrast, the\nstrong bar fraction is constant between $0.5 < z < 2.5$. This implies that the\nstrong bars found in this work are robust long-lived structures, unless the\nrate of bar destruction is similar to the rate of bar formation. Finally, our\nresults are consistent with disc instabilities being the dominant mode of bar\nformation at lower redshifts, while bar formation through interactions and\nmergers is more common at higher redshifts.",

Such behavior could be very hard to detect, and if present in\nfuture advanced systems, could pose severe loss of control risk. It is\ntherefore important for AI developers to rule out harm from scheming prior to\nmodel deployment. In this paper, we present a suite of scheming reasoning\nevaluations measuring two types of reasoning capabilities that we believe are\nprerequisites for successful scheming: First, we propose five evaluations of\nability to reason about and circumvent oversight (stealth). Second, we present\neleven evaluations for measuring a model's ability to instrumentally reason\nabout itself, its environment and its deployment (situational awareness). We\ndemonstrate how these evaluations can be used as part of a scheming inability\nsafety case: a model that does not succeed on these evaluations is almost\ncertainly incapable of causing severe harm via scheming in real deployment. We\nrun our evaluations on current frontier models and find that none of them show\nconcerning levels of either situational awareness or stealth.",

Contrary to conventional single bit quantizers which only\nutilize the transmitted bit to convey information, in our codebook, we use an\nadditional `$\\emptyset$' symbol to encode the event of \\emph{not transmitting}.\nThus, our quantization functions are composed of three decision regions as\nopposed to the conventional two regions. First, we propose an optimum\nquantization method in which the optimum quantization functions are obtained by\ntracking the distributions of the quantization error. However, this method\nrequires a high computational cost and might not be applicable for\nenergy-conserving sensors. Thus, we propose two additional low complexity\nmethods. In the last-bit aware method, three predefined quantization functions\nare available to both devices, and they switch the quantization function based\non the last transmitted bit. With the Gaussian approximation method, we\ncalculate a single quantization function by assuming that the quantization\nerror can be approximated as Gaussian. While previous methods require a\nconstant delay assumption, this method also works for random delay. We observe\nthat all three methods perform similarly in terms of mean-squared error and\ntransmission cost.",

We take a step towards remedying this issue by providing a way to\nrelate the complexity of a problem $\\Pi$ on trees to its truly local\ncomplexity, which is the (asymptotically) smallest function $f$ such that $\\Pi$\ncan be solved in $O(f(\\Delta)+\\log^*n)$ rounds. More specifically, we develop a\ntransformation that takes an algorithm $\\mathcal A$ for $\\Pi$ with a runtime of\n$O(f(\\Delta)+\\log^*n)$ rounds as input and transforms it into an\n$O(f(g(n))+\\log^* n)$-round algorithm $\\mathcal{A}'$ on trees, where $g$ is the\nfunction that satisfies $g(n)^{f(g(n))}=n$. If $f$ is the truly local\ncomplexity of $\\Pi$ (i.e., if $\\mathcal{A}$ is asymptotically optimal), then\n$\\mathcal{A}'$ is an asymptotically optimal algorithm on trees, conditioned on\na natural assumption on the nature of the worst-case instances of $\\Pi$. Our\ntransformation works for any member of a wide class of problems, including the\nmost important symmetry-breaking problems. As an example of our transformation\nwe obtain the first strongly sublogarithmic algorithm for\n$(\\text{edge-degree+1})$-edge coloring (and therefore also $(2\\Delta-1)$-edge\ncoloring) on trees, exhibiting a runtime of $O(\\log^{12/13} n)$ rounds. This\nbreaks through the $\\Omega(\\log n/\\log\\log n)$-barrier that is a fundamental\nlower bound for other symmetry-breaking problems such as maximal independent\nset or maximal matching (that already holds on trees), and proves a separation\nbetween these problems and the aforementioned edge coloring problems on trees.\nWe extend a subset of our results to graphs of bounded arboricity.",

A fixed-point technique was developed to\nfollow up individual CFs by means of time-controlled insertion into premixed\nmethane/air flames, followed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and\nenergy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses. Besides diameter\nreduction, three localized damage mechanisms were discerned in presence of\nimpurities, which were quantified by neutron activation analysis (NAA). Severe\npitting was ascribed to catalytic oxidation mainly caused by alkali and\nalkaline earth metals. After an initial period where catalytic reactions\nbetween impurities and the carbon surface dominate, the flame stoichiometry\ngoverned the CF gasification process, with lean flames being much more\naggressive than rich ones. A second mechanism, channelling, was caused by\nmobile metallic impurities. Some impurities showed an opposite effect, lowering\nreactivity and thus preventing further catalysis. Amorphous damage with a\nskin-peeling effect is believed to be the result of localized impurities at\nhigh concentrations and microstructural variations. Hindrance or synergistic\neffects between impurities are discussed. Finally, apparent axial pit growth\nrates were determined and compared with other carbonaceous materials, revealing\na strong influence of impurities and the flame reactive atmosphere on CF\noxidation.",

    "abstract": "The rapid rise of video diffusion models has enabled the generation of highly\nrealistic and temporally coherent videos, raising critical concerns about\ncontent authenticity, provenance, and misuse. Existing watermarking approaches,\nwhether passive, post-hoc, or adapted from image-based techniques, often\nstruggle to withstand video-specific manipulations such as frame insertion,\ndropping, or reordering, and typically degrade visual quality. In this work, we\nintroduce VIDSTAMP, a watermarking framework that embeds per-frame or\nper-segment messages directly into the latent space of temporally-aware video\ndiffusion models. By fine-tuning the model's decoder through a two-stage\npipeline, first on static image datasets to promote spatial message separation,\nand then on synthesized video sequences to restore temporal consistency,\nVIDSTAMP learns to embed high-capacity, flexible watermarks with minimal\nperceptual impact. Leveraging architectural components such as 3D convolutions\nand temporal attention, our method imposes no additional inference cost and\noffers better perceptual quality than prior methods, while maintaining\ncomparable robustness against common distortions and tampering. VIDSTAMP embeds\n768 bits per video (48 bits per frame) with a bit accuracy of 95.0%, achieves a\nlog P-value of -166.65 (lower is better), and maintains a video quality score\nof 0.836, comparable to unwatermarked outputs (0.838) and surpassing prior\nmethods in capacity-quality tradeoffs.

    "abstract": "This is a preprint of a review article that has not yet undergone peer\nreview. The content is intended for early dissemination and academic\ndiscussion. The final version may differ upon formal publication. As the Fourth\nIndustrial Revolution reshapes industrial paradigms, human-robot collaboration\n(HRC) has transitioned from a desirable capability to an operational necessity.\nIn response, collaborative robots (Cobots) are evolving beyond repetitive tasks\ntoward adaptive, semantically informed interaction with humans and\nenvironments. This paper surveys five foundational pillars enabling this\ntransformation: semantic-level perception, cognitive action planning,\nexplainable learning and control, safety-aware motion design, and multimodal\nhuman intention recognition. We examine the role of semantic mapping in\ntransforming spatial data into meaningful context, and explore cognitive\nplanning frameworks that leverage this context for goal-driven decision-making.\nAdditionally, we analyze explainable reinforcement learning methods, including\npolicy distillation and attention mechanisms, which enhance interpretability\nand trust. Safety is addressed through force-adaptive control and risk-aware\ntrajectory planning, while seamless human interaction is supported via gaze and\ngesture-based intent recognition. Despite these advancements, challenges such\nas perception-action disjunction, real-time explainability limitations, and\nincomplete human trust persist. To address these, we propose a unified\nCognitive Synergy Architecture, integrating all modules into a cohesive\nframework for truly human-centric cobot collaboration.",

To this end, we extend the Cahn-Hilliard free-energy\nfunctional to incorporate an elastic strain energy and a coupling term. These\ncontributions are naturally obtained from a derivation that starts from an\nentropic elastic energy density combined with the assumption of weak\ncompressibility, upon second-order approximation around the swollen state. The\nresulting terms correspond to those of a poroelastic formulation where the\ncoupling energetic term can be interpreted as the osmotic work of the solvent\nwithin the polymer matrix. Additionally, a convolution term is included in the\ntotal energy to model non-local forces responsible for coarsening arrest. With\nanalytical derivations in 1D and finite element computations in 2D we show that\nthe mechanical deformation controls the composition of the stable phases, the\ninitial characteristic length and time, the coarsening rates and the arrested\ncharacteristic length. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed coupling is\nable to predict the arrest of coarsening at a length scale controlled by the\nstiffness of the dry polymer. The numerical results show excellent agreement\nwith the experimental evidence in terms of phase-separated morphology and\nscaling of the characteristic length with the stiffness of the dry polymer.",

    "abstract": "We present the first scene-update aerial path planning algorithm specifically\ndesigned for detecting and updating change areas in urban environments. While\nexisting methods for large-scale 3D urban scene reconstruction focus on\nachieving high accuracy and completeness, they are inefficient for scenarios\nrequiring periodic updates, as they often re-explore and reconstruct entire\nscenes, wasting significant time and resources on unchanged areas. To address\nthis limitation, our method leverages prior reconstructions and change\nprobability statistics to guide UAVs in detecting and focusing on areas likely\nto have changed. Our approach introduces a novel changeability heuristic to\nevaluate the likelihood of changes, driving the planning of two flight paths: a\nprior path informed by static priors and a dynamic real-time path that adapts\nto newly detected changes. The framework integrates surface sampling and\ncandidate view generation strategies, ensuring efficient coverage of change\nareas with minimal redundancy. Extensive experiments on real-world urban\ndatasets demonstrate that our method significantly reduces flight time and\ncomputational overhead, while maintaining high-quality updates comparable to\nfull-scene re-exploration and reconstruction. These contributions pave the way\nfor efficient, scalable, and adaptive UAV-based scene updates in complex urban\nenvironments.",

    "abstract": "The mixing of material from stellar convective cores into their adjacent\nradiative layers has been a matter of long-standing debate. Pulsating subdwarf\nB stars offer excellent conditions to advance our understanding of this\nproblem. In this work we use a model-independent approach to infer information\nabout the cores of three subdwarf B stars and compare it with similar\ninferences from earlier analysis of red giants in the helium core-burning\nphase. This is achieved by fitting an analytical description of the\ngravity-mode pulsation periods to pulsation data collected by the Kepler\nsatellite. From the fits we infer the reduced asymptotic period spacings and\nthe amplitude and position of sharp structural variations associated with\nchemical discontinuities in the stellar interiors. Our results indicate the\npresence of sharp structural variations with similar properties in all three\nstars, located near the edge of the gravity-mode propagation cavity and likely\nassociated with the C-O/He transition. We find that these structural variations\ndiffer systematically from those of helium core-burning red giant stars, having\nlarger amplitudes and being located at a larger buoyancy radius. This suggests\nthat chemical mixing beyond the adiabatically stratified core into the\nradiatively stratified layers may be more extensive in subdwarf B stars than in\nhelium core-burning red giants. Alternatively, the stratification of the mixing\nregion beyond the adiabatically stratified core may differ significantly\nbetween the two types of stars. The model-independent constraints set on the\nstructural variations inside these three stars are the first of a kind and will\nbe key to enhance the modelling of layers adjacent to stellar convective cores\nand to test non-canonical stellar evolution channels leading to the formation\nof hot subdwarf stars.",

As a result, the\ncomputational complexity of approximate solutions is $O(n_t)$, where $n_t$ is\nthe number of parameters in the trajectory, thereby significantly reducing the\noverall computational burden.

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for spatial audio in applications such as virtual\nreality, immersive media, and spatial audio research necessitates robust\nsolutions to generate binaural audio data sets for use in testing and\nvalidation. Binamix is an open-source Python library designed to facilitate\nprogrammatic binaural mixing using the extensive SADIE II Database, which\nprovides Head Related Impulse Response (HRIR) and Binaural Room Impulse\nResponse (BRIR) data for 20 subjects. The Binamix library provides a flexible\nand repeatable framework for creating large-scale spatial audio datasets,\nmaking it an invaluable resource for codec evaluation, audio quality metric\ndevelopment, and machine learning model training. A range of pre-built example\nscripts, utility functions, and visualization plots further streamline the\nprocess of custom pipeline creation. This paper presents an overview of the\nlibrary's capabilities, including binaural rendering, impulse response\ninterpolation, and multi-track mixing for various speaker layouts. The tools\nutilize a modified Delaunay triangulation technique to achieve accurate\nHRIR/BRIR interpolation where desired angles are not present in the data. By\nsupporting a wide range of parameters such as azimuth, elevation, subject\nImpulse Responses (IRs), speaker layouts, mixing controls, and more, the\nlibrary enables researchers to create large binaural datasets for any\ndownstream purpose. Binamix empowers researchers and developers to advance\nspatial audio applications with reproducible methodologies by offering an\nopen-source solution for binaural rendering and dataset generation.

This paper examines the reasoning capabilities of\ncontemporary LLMs, analyzing their strengths, limitations, and potential for\nimprovement. The study uses prompt engineering techniques on the Graduate-Level\nGoogleProof Q&A (GPQA) dataset to assess the scientific reasoning of GPT-4o.\nFive popular prompt engineering techniques and two tailored promptings were\ntested: baseline direct answer (zero-shot), chain-of-thought (CoT), zero-shot\nCoT, self-ask, self-consistency, decomposition, and multipath promptings. Our\nfindings indicate that while LLMs exhibit emergent reasoning abilities, they\noften rely on pattern recognition rather than true logical inference, leading\nto inconsistencies in complex problem-solving. The results indicated that\nself-consistency outperformed the other prompt engineering technique with an\naccuracy of 52.99%, followed by direct answer (52.23%). Zero-shot CoT (50%)\noutperformed multipath (48.44%), decomposition (47.77%), self-ask (46.88%), and\nCoT (43.75%). Self-consistency performed the second worst in explaining the\nanswers. Simple techniques such as direct answer, CoT, and zero-shot CoT have\nthe best scientific reasoning. We propose a research agenda aimed at bridging\nthese gaps by integrating structured reasoning frameworks, hybrid AI\napproaches, and human-in-the-loop methodologies.

    "abstract": "We present an exact analytical investigation of spin precession for a test\ngyroscope in the magnetized Kerr spacetime--an exact electrovacuum solution to\nthe Einstein-Maxwell equations. Our approach accommodates arbitrary magnetic\nfield strengths, enabling a unified treatment across both weak and ultra-strong\nfield regimes. The analysis reveals distinct spin precession behaviors near\nrotating collapsed objects, which differ characteristically between black holes\nand naked singularities, offering a potential observational means to\ndifferentiate them. The external magnetic field induces a nontrivial\nmodification of the precession frequency through its interaction with the\nspacetime's gravitoelectromagnetic structure. In the weak-field limit, magnetic\nfields generally reduce the precession rate, though the effect depends\nsensitively on the motion and orientation of the test gyro close to the\ncollapsed object. As a special case, we show that in the presence of magnetic\nfields, the spin precession frequency due to gravitomagnetic effect acquires a\nlong-range $1/r$ (where $r$ is the distance from the central object to the test\ngyro) correction in contrast to the standard $1/r^3$ falloff. In addition, we\nobtain the exact geodetic precession (gravitoelectric effect) frequency for a\ngyroscope in magnetized Schwarzschild spacetime, showing that the magnetic\nfield enhances ($\\propto r^{1/2}$) geodetic precession in contrast to the\nstandard $1/r^{5/2}$ falloff. Our results provide observationally testable\npredictions relevant for black holes in strong magnetic environments, including\nthose possibly realized near magnetars or in the early universe.

These vulnerabilities expose the system to\ninternal faults and cyber threats, particularly False Data Injection (FDI)\nattacks, which can closely mimic real fault scenarios. Hence, this work\npresents a two-stage fault and cyberattack detection framework tailored for\ninverter-based microgrids. Stage 1 introduces an unsupervised learning model\nFeature Feedback Generative Adversarial Network (F2GAN), to distinguish between\ngenuine internal faults and cyber-induced anomalies in microgrids. Compared to\nconventional GAN architectures, F2GAN demonstrates improved system diagnosis\nand greater adaptability to zero-day attacks through its feature-feedback\nmechanism. In Stage 2, supervised machine learning techniques, including\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT),\nand Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are applied to localize and classify\nfaults within inverter switches, distinguishing between single-switch and\nmulti-switch faults.

For nearly forty years, TD learning has served as\na workhorse for applied RL as well as a building block for more complex and\nspecialized algorithms. However, despite its widespread use, TD procedures are\ngenerally sensitive to step size specification. A poor choice of step size can\ndramatically increase variance and slow convergence in both on-policy and\noff-policy evaluation tasks. In practice, researchers use trial and error to\nidentify stable step sizes, but these approaches tend to be ad hoc and\ninefficient. As an alternative, we propose implicit TD algorithms that\nreformulate TD updates into fixed point equations. Such updates are more stable\nand less sensitive to step size without sacrificing computational efficiency.\nMoreover, we derive asymptotic convergence guarantees and finite-time error\nbounds for our proposed implicit TD algorithms, which include implicit TD(0),\nTD($\\lambda$), and TD with gradient correction (TDC). Our results show that\nimplicit TD algorithms are applicable to a much broader range of step sizes,\nand thus provide a robust and versatile framework for policy evaluation and\nvalue approximation in modern RL tasks.

    "abstract": "In official statistics, dual system estimation (DSE) is a well-known tool to\nestimate the size of a population. Two sources are linked, and the number of\nunits that are missed by both sources is estimated. Often dual system\nestimation is carried out in each of the levels of a stratifying variable, such\nas region. DSE can be considered a loglinear independence model, and, with a\nstratifying variable, a loglinear conditional independence model. The standard\napproach is to estimate parameters for each level of the stratifying variable.\nThus, when the number of levels of the stratifying variable is large, the\nnumber of parameters estimated is large as well. Mixed effects loglinear\nmodels, where sets of parameters involving the stratifying variable are\nreplaced by a distribution parameterised by its mean and a variance, have also\nbeen proposed, and we investigate their properties through simulation. In our\nsimulation studies the mixed effects loglinear model outperforms the fixed\neffects loglinear model although only to a small extent in terms of mean\nsquared error. We show how mixed effects dual system estimation can be extended\nto multiple system estimation.",

In this work, we demonstrate\nthe use of hybrid optical nonlinearities that occur in two different materials.\nThis approach allows us to observe combined Raman scattering and Kerr frequency\ncomb generation using silicon nitride (Si3N4) microresonators with fused silica\ncladding. Here, the fused silica cladding provides Raman gain, while the\nsilicon nitride core provides the Kerr nonlinearity for frequency comb\ngeneration. This way we can add Raman scattering to an integrated photonic\nsilicon nitride platform, in which Raman scattering has not been observed so\nfar because of insufficient Raman gain. The Raman lasing is observed in the\nsilica-clad silicon nitride resonators at an on-chip optical power of 143 mW,\nwhich agrees with theoretical simulations. This can be reduced to mw-level with\nimproved optical quality factor. Broadband Raman-Kerr frequency comb generation\nis realized through dispersion engineering of the waveguides. The use of hybrid\noptical nonlinearities in multiple materials opens up new functionalities for\nintegrated photonic devices, e.g. by combining second and third-order nonlinear\nmaterials for combined supercontinuum generation and self-referencing of\nfrequency combs. Combining materials with low threshold powers for different\nnonlinearities can be the key to highly efficient nonlinear photonic circuits\nfor compact laser sources, high-resolution spectroscopy, frequency synthesis in\nthe infrared and UV, telecommunications and quantum information processing.",

    "abstract": "Large multi-modal models inevitably decay over time as facts update and\npreviously learned information becomes outdated. Traditional approaches such as\nfine-tuning are often impractical for updating these models due to their size\nand complexity. Instead, direct knowledge editing within the models presents a\nmore viable solution. Current model editing techniques, however, typically\noverlook the unique influence ranges of different facts, leading to compromised\nmodel performance in terms of both generality and locality. To address this\nissue, we introduce the concept of the generality-locality trade-off in\nmulti-modal model editing. We develop a new model editing dataset named OKEDIT,\nspecifically designed to effectively evaluate this trade-off. Building on this\nfoundation, we propose \\textbf{BalancEdit}, a novel method for balanced model\nediting that dynamically achieves an optimal balance between generality and\nlocality. BalancEdit utilizes a unique mechanism that generates both positive\nand negative samples for each fact to accurately determine its influence scope\nand incorporates these insights into the model's latent space using a discrete,\nlocalized codebook of edits, without modifying the underlying model weights. To\nour knowledge, this is the first approach explicitly addressing the\ngenerality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. Our comprehensive\nresults confirm the effectiveness of BalancEdit, demonstrating minimal\ntrade-offs while maintaining robust editing capabilities.

    "abstract": "Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm to address the\nchallenges of next-generation communication networks. While some progress has\nbeen made in its conceptualization, fundamental questions remain unresolved. In\nthis paper, we propose a probabilistic model for semantic communication that,\nunlike prior works primarily rooted in intuitions from human language, is\ngrounded in a rigorous philosophical conception of information and its\nrelationship with data as Constraining Affordances, mediated by Levels of\nAbstraction (LoA). This foundation not only enables the modeling of linguistic\nsemantic communication but also provides a domain-independent definition of\nsemantic content, extending its applicability beyond linguistic contexts. As\nthe semantic communication problem involves a complex interplay of various\nfactors, making it difficult to tackle in its entirety, we propose to\northogonalize it by classifying it into simpler sub-problems and approach the\ngeneral problem step by step. Notably, we show that Shannon's framework\nconstitutes a special case of semantic communication, in which each message\nconveys a single, unambiguous meaning. Consequently, the capacity in Shannon's\nmodel-defined as the maximum rate of reliably transmissible messages-coincides\nwith the semantic capacity under this constrained scenario. In this paper, we\nspecifically focus on the sub-problem where semantic ambiguity arises solely\nfrom physical channel noise and derive a lower bound for its semantic capacity,\nwhich reduces to Shannon's capacity in the corresponding special case. We also\ndemonstrate that the achievable rate of all transmissible messages for reliable\nsemantic communication, exceeds Shannon's capacity by the added term H(X|S).",

In this study, we introduce\nDebtStreamness, a novel metric inspired by trophic levels in ecological food\nwebs, to quantify the position of firms within credit chains. By viewing credit\nas the ``primary energy source'' of the economy, we measure how far credit\ntravels through inter-firm relationships before reaching its final borrowers.\nApplying this framework to Uruguay's inter-firm credit network, using survey\ndata from the Central Bank, we find that credit chains are generally short,\nwith a tiered structure in which some firms act as intermediaries, lending to\nothers further along the chain. We also find that local network motifs such as\nloops can substantially increase a firm's DebtStreamness, even when its direct\nborrowing from banks remains the same. Comparing our results with standard\neconomic classifications based on input-output linkages, we find that\nDebtStreamness captures distinct financial structures not visible through\nproduction data. We further validate our approach using two maximum-entropy\nnetwork reconstruction methods, demonstrating the robustness of DebtStreamness\nin capturing systemic credit structures. These results suggest that\nDebtStreamness offers a complementary ecological perspective on systemic credit\nrisk and highlights the role of hidden financial intermediation in firm\nnetworks.",

TRAVELER assesses models' abilities to resolve\nexplicit, implicit relative to speech time, and vague temporal references.\nBeyond investigating the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs depending on the\ntype of temporal reference, our benchmark also allows evaluation of performance\nin relation to the length of the set of events.

In this paper, we propose FreeInsert, a novel framework that\nleverages foundation models including MLLMs, LGMs, and diffusion models to\ndisentangle object generation from spatial placement. This enables unsupervised\nand flexible object insertion in 3D scenes without spatial priors. FreeInsert\nstarts with an MLLM-based parser that extracts structured semantics, including\nobject types, spatial relationships, and attachment regions, from user\ninstructions. These semantics guide both the reconstruction of the inserted\nobject for 3D consistency and the learning of its degrees of freedom. We\nleverage the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to initialize object pose\nand scale. A hierarchical, spatially aware refinement stage further integrates\nspatial semantics and MLLM-inferred priors to enhance placement. Finally, the\nappearance of the object is improved using the inserted-object image to enhance\nvisual fidelity.

    "abstract": "The recent growth in the use of Large Language Models has made them\nvulnerable to sophisticated adversarial assaults, manipulative prompts, and\nencoded malicious inputs. Existing countermeasures frequently necessitate\nretraining models, which is computationally costly and impracticable for\ndeployment. Without the need for retraining or fine-tuning, this study presents\na unique defense paradigm that allows LLMs to recognize, filter, and defend\nagainst adversarial or malicious inputs on their own. There are two main parts\nto the suggested framework: (1) A prompt filtering module that uses\nsophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including zero-shot\nclassification, keyword analysis, and encoded content detection (e.g. base64,\nhexadecimal, URL encoding), to detect, decode, and classify harmful inputs; and\n(2) A summarization module that processes and summarizes adversarial research\nliterature to give the LLM context-aware defense knowledge. This approach\nstrengthens LLMs' resistance to adversarial exploitation by fusing text\nextraction, summarization, and harmful prompt analysis. According to\nexperimental results, this integrated technique has a 98.71% success rate in\nidentifying harmful patterns, manipulative language structures, and encoded\nprompts. By employing a modest amount of adversarial research literature as\ncontext, the methodology also allows the model to react correctly to harmful\ninputs with a larger percentage of jailbreak resistance and refusal rate.

Conventional, manual,\nsampling-based pest recognition methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming,\ncostly, require expertise, and may not even detect hidden infestations. In\nrecent years, the electronic nose (e-nose) approach has emerged as a potential\nalternative for agricultural grain pest recognition and monitoring. An e-nose\nmimics human olfactory systems by integrating a sensor array, data acquisition,\nand analysis for recognizing grain pests by analyzing volatile organic\ncompounds (VOCs) emitted by grain and pests. However, well-documented, curated,\nand synthesized literature on the use of e-nose technology for grain pest\ndetection is lacking. Therefore, this systematic literature review provides a\ncomprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art e-nose technology for\nagricultural grain pest monitoring. The review examines employed sensor\ntechnology, targeted pest species type, grain medium, data processing, and\npattern recognition techniques. An e-nose is a promising tool that offers a\nrapid, low-cost, non-destructive solution for detecting, identifying, and\nmonitoring grain pests, including microscopic and hidden insects, with good\naccuracy. We identified the factors that influence the e-nose performance,\nwhich include pest species, storage duration, temperature, moisture content,\nand pest density. The major challenges include sensor array optimization or\nselection, large data processing, poor repeatability, and comparability among\nmeasurements. An inexpensive and portable e-nose has the potential to help\nstakeholders and storage managers take timely and data-driven informed actions\nor decisions to reduce overall food and economic losses.",

    "abstract": "Measurements of fission fragment mass distributions provide valuable insights\ninto the properties of fissioning systems and the dynamics of the fission\nprocess. Pre-neutron emission distributions, essential for fission fragment\nevaporation codes like \\cgmf{}, are extracted from distributions that are\nalways measured after neutron emission, as the time scale of the emission of\nprompt fission neutrons is too short for direct measurement before the\nemission. However, obtaining accurate pre-neutron emission distributions\nrequires methods that eliminate the effects of mass resolution and detector\nefficiency. We propose a deblurring technique based on the Richardson-Lucy (RL)\nalgorithm, commonly used in optics for image restoration, to correct for these\nexperimental effects. The RL algorithm uses the measured mass distributions and\na transfer matrix to perform iterative deconvolution. The advantage of this\nmethod over others is that it does not assume any predefined shape such as a\nsum of Gaussians, as in \\cgmf{}, for the distributions. In this paper, we apply\nthe algorithm to the fission fragment mass distributions measured in the\nspontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf to extract pre-neutron emission fission\nfragment mass distributions.

    "abstract": "Accurate wind power forecasting can help formulate scientific dispatch plans,\nwhich is of great significance for maintaining the safety, stability, and\nefficient operation of the power system. In recent years, wind power\nforecasting methods based on deep learning have focused on extracting the\nspatiotemporal correlations among data, achieving significant improvements in\nforecasting accuracy. However, they exhibit two limitations. First, there is a\nlack of modeling for the inter-variable relationships, which limits the\naccuracy of the forecasts. Second, by treating endogenous and exogenous\nvariables equally, it leads to unnecessary interactions between the endogenous\nand exogenous variables, increasing the complexity of the model. In this paper,\nwe propose the 2DXformer, which, building upon the previous work's focus on\nspatiotemporal correlations, addresses the aforementioned two limitations.\nSpecifically, we classify the inputs of the model into three types: exogenous\nstatic variables, exogenous dynamic variables, and endogenous variables. First,\nwe embed these variables as variable tokens in a channel-independent manner.\nThen, we use the attention mechanism to capture the correlations among\nexogenous variables. Finally, we employ a multi-layer perceptron with residual\nconnections to model the impact of exogenous variables on endogenous variables.\nExperimental results on two real-world large-scale datasets indicate that our\nproposed 2DXformer can further improve the performance of wind power\nforecasting.

In this work,\nprincipal component analysis of 2-point correlation functions is performed to\nextract the salient features from a large dataset of randomly generated 2D\nmetamaterials. Physics-based simulations are performed using a fast Fourier\ntransform (FFT)-based homogenization approach to efficiently compute the\nhomogenized effective elastic stiffness across the extensive unit cell designs.\nSubsequently, Gaussian process regression is used to generate reduced-order\nsurrogates, mapping unit cell designs to their homogenized effective elastic\nconstant. It is demonstrated that the adopted workflow enables a high-value\nlow-dimensional representation of the voluminous stochastic metamaterial\ndataset, facilitating the construction of robust structure-property maps.\nFinally, an uncertainty-based active learning framework is utilized to train a\nsurrogate model with a significantly smaller number of data points compared to\nthe original full dataset.

We investigate the\nimpact of massive neutrinos on the galaxy bispectrum in redshift-space,\nadopting a spherical harmonic multipole decomposition $B_L^m(k_1, \\mu, t)$,\nthat captures the full angular dependence. We develop an analytical and\nnumerical framework incorporating neutrino-corrected perturbation theory\nkernels and redshift-space distortions. Our results demonstrate that the linear\ntriangle configurations are particularly sensitive to massive neutrinos, with\ndeviations reaching up to $\\sim 2\\%$ for a total mass $\\sum m_\\nu =\n0.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. To assess detection prospects in galaxy surveys like\n\\textit{Euclid}, we compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for individual\nmultipoles, including the effects of Finger-of-God damping and shot noise. The\nneutrino-induced signatures in $B_0^0$ and $B_2^0$ are found to be detectable\nwith SNR $\\gtrsim 5$ across a range of configurations, even after accounting\nfor small-scale suppression. Higher-order multipoles such as $B_2^1$ and\n$B_2^2$ are moderately sensitive, with SNR $\\gtrsim$ ($2-3$) in squeezed\nlimits, while hexadecapole moments are more suppressed but still exhibit\nmeasurable signals at high $k_1$. Additionally, the SNR generally increases\nwith wave number $k_1$, particularly for squeezed and stretched triangles,\nsuggesting that access to smaller scales significantly enhances detection\nprospects. Our study highlights the potential of the redshift-space bispectrum\nmultipoles as sensitive probes of massive neutrinos, complementing traditional\npower spectrum analyses, and underscores the importance of angular information\nand higher-order statistics for galaxy surveys.",

    "abstract": "The diffusion-based adversarial purification methods attempt to drown\nadversarial perturbations into a part of isotropic noise through the forward\nprocess, and then recover the clean images through the reverse process. Due to\nthe lack of distribution information about adversarial perturbations in the\npixel domain, it is often unavoidable to damage normal semantics. We turn to\nthe frequency domain perspective, decomposing the image into amplitude spectrum\nand phase spectrum. We find that for both spectra, the damage caused by\nadversarial perturbations tends to increase monotonically with frequency. This\nmeans that we can extract the content and structural information of the\noriginal clean sample from the frequency components that are less damaged.\nMeanwhile, theoretical analysis indicates that existing purification methods\nindiscriminately damage all frequency components, leading to excessive damage\nto the image. Therefore, we propose a purification method that can eliminate\nadversarial perturbations while maximizing the preservation of the content and\nstructure of the original image. Specifically, at each time step during the\nreverse process, for the amplitude spectrum, we replace the low-frequency\ncomponents of the estimated image's amplitude spectrum with the corresponding\nparts of the adversarial image. For the phase spectrum, we project the phase of\nthe estimated image into a designated range of the adversarial image's phase\nspectrum, focusing on the low frequencies. Empirical evidence from extensive\nexperiments demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms most current\ndefense methods.",

This study is the first to employ\na lumped parameter model to simulate the effects of lung resection.

LLMs using the RISEN framework developed deductive parent codes\nsimilar to human codes, but humans excelled in inductive child code development\nand theme synthesis. Knowledge-based LLMs reached coding saturation with fewer\ntranscripts (10-15) than the out-of-the-box model (15-20) and humans (90-99).\nThe out-of-the-box LLM identified a comparable number of excerpts to human\nresearchers, showing strong inter-rater reliability (K = 0.84), though the\nknowledge-based LLM produced fewer excerpts. Human excerpts were longer and\ninvolved multiple codes per excerpt, while LLMs typically applied one code.\nOverall, LLM-based thematic analysis proved more cost-effective but lacked the\ndepth of human analysis.

    "abstract": "Bilevel optimization has recently attracted significant attention in machine\nlearning due to its wide range of applications and advanced hierarchical\noptimization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play framework,\nnamed PnPBO, for developing and analyzing stochastic bilevel optimization\nmethods. This framework integrates both modern unbiased and biased stochastic\nestimators into the single-loop bilevel optimization framework introduced in\n[9], with several improvements. In the implementation of PnPBO, all stochastic\nestimators for different variables can be independently incorporated, and an\nadditional moving average technique is applied when using an unbiased estimator\nfor the upper-level variable. In the theoretical analysis, we provide a unified\nconvergence and complexity analysis for PnPBO, demonstrating that the\nadaptation of various stochastic estimators (including PAGE, ZeroSARAH, and\nmixed strategies) within the PnPBO framework achieves optimal sample\ncomplexity, comparable to that of single-level optimization. This resolves the\nopen question of whether the optimal complexity bounds for solving bilevel\noptimization are identical to those for single-level optimization. Finally, we\nempirically validate our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness on several\nbenchmark problems and confirming our theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "Online multi-object tracking has been recently dominated by\ntracking-by-detection (TbD) methods, where recent advances rely on increasingly\nsophisticated heuristics for tracklet representation, feature fusion, and\nmulti-stage matching. The key strength of TbD lies in its modular design,\nenabling the integration of specialized off-the-shelf models like motion\npredictors and re-identification. However, the extensive usage of human-crafted\nrules for temporal associations makes these methods inherently limited in their\nability to capture the complex interplay between various tracking cues. In this\nwork, we introduce CAMEL, a novel association module for Context-Aware\nMulti-Cue ExpLoitation, that learns resilient association strategies directly\nfrom data, breaking free from hand-crafted heuristics while maintaining TbD's\nvaluable modularity. At its core, CAMEL employs two transformer-based modules\nand relies on a novel association-centric training scheme to effectively model\nthe complex interactions between tracked targets and their various association\ncues. Unlike end-to-end detection-by-tracking approaches, our method remains\nlightweight and fast to train while being able to leverage external\noff-the-shelf models. Our proposed online tracking pipeline, CAMELTrack,\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple tracking benchmarks.

    "abstract": "The NSGA-III is a prominent algorithm in evolutionary many-objective\noptimization. It is well-suited for optimizing functions with more than three\nobjectives, setting it apart from the classic NSGA-II. However, theoretical\ninsights about NSGA-III of when and why it performs well are still in its early\ndevelopment. This paper addresses this point and conducts a rigorous runtime\nanalysis of NSGA-III on the many-objective $\\OJZJfull$ benchmark ($\\OJZJ$ for\nshort), providing runtime bounds where the number of objectives is constant. We\nshow that NSGA-III finds the Pareto front of $\\OJZJ$ in time $O(n^{k+d/2}+ \\mu\nn \\ln(n))$ where $n$ is the problem size, $d$ is the number of objectives, $k$\nis the gap size, a problem specific parameter, if its population size $\\mu \\in\n2^{O(n)}$ is at least $(2n/d+1)^{d/2}$. Notably, NSGA-III is faster than\nNSGA-II by a factor of $\\mu/n^{d/2}$ for some $\\mu \\in \\omega(n^{d/2})$. We\nalso show that a stochastic population update, proposed by~\\citet{UpBian},\nprovably guarantees a speedup of order $\\Theta((k/b)^{k-1})$ in the runtime\nwhere $b>0$ is a constant. Besides~\\cite{DoerrNearTight}, this is the first\nrigorous runtime analysis of NSGA-III on \\OJZJ. Proving these bounds requires a\nmuch deeper understanding of the population dynamics of NSGA-III than previous\npapers achieved.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we compute the two-loop result of the null hexagonal Wilson\nloop with a Lagrangian insertion in planar, maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills\ntheory via a bootstrap approach. Normalized by the null polygonal Wilson loop\nitself, the integrand-level result of this observable corresponds to the\nlogarithm of the six-point three-loop amplitude in this theory, while its\nintegrated result is conjectured to match the maximal transcendental part of\nthe six-point three-loop all-plus amplitude in pure Yang-Mills theory. Our work\nbuilds on two recent advances. On the one hand, the set of leading\nsingularities relevant to this observable was recently classified. On the other\nhand, the relevant space of special functions that may in principle accompany\nthese leading singularities was determined at two loops and for six particles\nby a dedicated Feynman integral calculation. These two ingredients serve as the\nfoundation of our bootstrap ansatz. We fix all indeterminates in this ansatz by\nimposing physical constraints, such as symmetries, absence of spurious\ndivergences, and correct behavior in soft and collinear limits. Finally, we\ndiscuss and verify certain physical properties of our symbol result, including\nphysical singularities, behavior under multi-Regge limit, as well as Steinmann\nrelations between symbol entries. The latter relations are motivated by the\ncorrespondence to all-plus amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills theory, and\nsuccessfully checking them constitutes a consistency check of this conjectured\ncorrespondence.",

To ensure robust uncertainty assessment, we integrate a novel\nBayesian Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) framework, systematically capturing\nvariability in transmission rates, recovery times, and mortality estimates. Our\ncomparative analysis demonstrates that while general mobility restrictions\nreduce overall transmission, a workforce rotation strategy for essential\nworkers, when combined with quarantine enforcement, most effectively limits\nworkplace outbreaks and secondary family infections. Unlike other\ninterventions, this approach preserves a portion of the susceptible population,\nresulting in a more controlled and sustainable epidemic trajectory.

Our methodology covers single- and\nmulti-channel spectral analysis up to the bispectrum (third order) and\ntrispectrum (fourth order), enabling robust investigations of inter-frequency\ncoupling, non-Gaussian behavior, and time-reversal symmetry breaking.\nAdditionally, we introduce quasi-polyspectra to uncover non-stationary,\ntime-dependent higher-order features. We implement these new estimators in\nSignalSnap, an open-source GPU-accelerated library capable of efficiently\nanalyzing datasets exceeding hundreds of gigabytes within minutes. In\napplications such as continuous quantum measurements, SignalSnap's rigorous\nestimators enable precise quantitative matching between experimental data and\ntheoretical models.",

We\nintroduce GPR-bench, a lightweight, extensible benchmark that operationalizes\nregression testing for general purpose use cases. GPR-bench couples an open,\nbilingual (English and Japanese) dataset covering eight task categories (e.g.,\ntext generation, code generation, and information retrieval) and 10 scenarios\nin each task categories (80 total test cases for each language) with an\nautomated evaluation pipeline that employs \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" scoring of\ncorrectness and conciseness. Experiments across three recent model versions -\ngpt-4o-mini, o3-mini, and o4-mini - and two prompt configurations (default\nversus concise-writing instruction) reveal heterogeneous quality. Our results\nshow that newer models generally improve correctness, but the differences are\nmodest and not statistically significant, suggesting that GPR-bench may not be\nsufficiently challenging to differentiate between recent model versions. In\ncontrast, the concise-writing instruction significantly enhances conciseness\n(+12.37 pp, Mann-Whitney U test: p < 0.001, effect size r = 0.2995) with\nminimal degradations on accuracy (-1.7 pp), demonstrating the effectiveness of\nprompt engineering.

In this study, we\nexplore the intricate and multifaceted role of cholesterol in modulating\nIL-membrane interactions, employing a comprehensive suite of biophysical\ntechniques. We systematically examine how IL alkyl chain length and membrane\nphysical state influence the impact of cholesterol on IL-lipid membrane\ninteraction. The incorporation of ILs is shown to increase the area per lipid\nin both pristine dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and DPPC-cholesterol\nmembranes. Cholesterol modulates the impact of ILs on lipid conformation,\nmembrane viscoelasticity, and phase behavior. Small-angle neutron scattering\nand dynamic light scattering measurements reveal that cholesterol mitigates\nIL-induced structural perturbations in vesicles. Our isothermal titration\ncalorimetry measurements reveal that the presence of cholesterol significantly\nweakens the binding of ILs to membranes. Intriguingly, despite this reduced\nbinding affinity, cholesterol-containing membranes demonstrate enhanced\npermeabilization. This counterintuitive effect is attributed to cholesterol's\nordering of lipid membranes, which increases susceptibility to stress and\ndefects. Our results underscore the complex and non-universal interplay between\nlipid composition, IL alkyl chain length, and membrane phase state.

Widely adopted methods, like the Granger causality test, capture\nstatistical dependencies between variables rather than genuine driver-response\nmechanisms. This critical gap stems from the absence of mathematical tools that\nreliably reconstruct underlying system dynamics from observational time-series\ndata. In this paper, we introduce a new control-based method for causality\ndiscovery through the behavior-system theory, which represents dynamical\nsystems via trajectory spaces and has been widely used in data-driven control.\nOur core contribution is the \\textbf{B}ehavior-\\textbf{e}nabled\n\\textbf{Caus}ality test (the BeCaus test), which transforms causality discovery\ninto solving fictitious control problems. By exploiting the intrinsic asymmetry\nbetween system inputs and outputs, the proposed method operationalizes our\nconceptualization of mechanistic causality: variable $X$ is a cause of $Y$ if\n$X$ (partially) drives the evolution of $Y$. We establish conditions for linear\ntime-invariant systems to be causality-discoverable, i.e., conditions for the\nBeCaus test to distinguish four basic causal structures (independence, full\ncausality, partial causality, and latent-common-cause relation). Notably, our\napproach accommodates open systems with unobserved inputs. Moreover, an\nexploratory case study indicates the new method's potential extensibility to\nnonlinear systems.",

We specifically address: (i) severe scarcity in\npositive class, stemming from both underlying organic skew in the data, as well\nas extremely limited labels; (ii) multi-class nature of the negative samples,\nwith uneven density distributions and partially overlapping feature\ndistributions; and (iii) massively unlabelled data leading to tiny and weak\nprior on both positive and negative classes, and possibility of unseen or\nunknown behavior in the unlabelled set, especially in the negative class.\nAlthough related to PU learning problems, we contend that knowledge (or lack of\nit) on the negative class can be leveraged to learn the compliment of it (i.e.,\nthe positive class) better in a semi-supervised manner. To this effect,\nScarceGAN re-formulates semi-supervised GAN by accommodating weakly labelled\nmulti-class negative samples and the available positive samples. It relaxes the\nsupervised discriminator's constraint on exact differentiation between negative\nsamples by introducing a 'leeway' term for samples with noisy prior. We propose\nmodifications to the cost objectives of discriminator, in supervised and\nunsupervised path as well as that of the generator. For identifying risky\nplayers in skill gaming, this formulation in whole gives us a recall of over\n85% (~60% jump over vanilla semi-supervised GAN) on our scarce class with very\nminimal verbosity in the unknown space.

This procedure is non-trivial to enforce on the basis of a\npurely data-driven approach and typically requires the adoption of numerical,\ne.g. finite element-based, simulation schemes of the dynamic behavior of these\naxles. Damage in this particular case can be formulated as a breathing crack\nproblem, which further complicates simulation by introducing response-dependent\nnonlinearities into the picture. In this study, first, a new crack detection\nfeature based on higher-order harmonics of the breathing crack is proposed,\ntermed Higher-Order Transmissibility (HOTr), and, secondly, its sensitivity and\nefficacy are assessed within the context of crack identification. Next, the\nmentioned feature is approximated via use of linear system theory, delivering a\nsurrogate model which facilitates the computation and speeds up the crack\nidentification procedure. The accuracy of the proposed method in reproducing\nthe delivered HOTr is compared against the nonlinear simulation model. The\nobtained results suggest that the approximation of the HOTr can significantly\nreduce the computational burden by eliminating the need for an iterative\nsolution of the governing nonlinear equation of motion, while maintaining a\nhigh level of accuracy when compared against the reference model.

The\npopulation model is a well-established and powerful model for asynchronous,\ndistributed computation with a large number of applications. For\nself-stabilizing leader election, the population of $n$ anonymous agents,\ninteracting in uniformly random pairs, must stabilize with a single leader from\nany possible initial configuration.\n  The focus of this paper is to develop time-efficient self-stabilizing\nprotocols whilst minimizing the number of states. We present a parametrized\nprotocol, which, for a suitable setting, achieves the asymptotically optimal\ntime $O(\\log n)$ using $2^{O(n^2\\log n)}$ states (throughout the paper,\n``time'' refers to ``parallel time'', i.e., the number of pairwise interactions\ndivided by $n$). This is a significant improvement over the previously best\nprotocol Sublinear-Time-SSR due to Burman, Chen, Chen, Doty, Nowak, Severson,\nand Xu (PODC '21), which requires $2^{O(n^{\\log n}\\log n)}$ states for the same\ntime bound. In general, for $1\\le r\\le n/2$, our protocol requires\n$2^{O(r^2\\log{n})}$ states and stabilizes in time $O((n\\log{n})/r)$, w.h.p.;\nthe above result is achieved for $r=\\Theta(n)$. For $r=\\log^2n$ our protocol\nrequires only sub-linear time using only $2^{O(\\log^3 n)}$ states, resolving an\nopen problem stated in that paper. Sublinear-Time-SSR requires $O(\\log n\\cdot\nn^{1/(H+1)})$ time using $2^{\\Theta(n^H) \\cdot \\log n}$ states for all $1\\le\nH\\le\\Theta(\\log n)$.\n  Similar to previous works, it solves leader election by assigning a unique\nrank from $1$ through $n$ to each agent. The principal bottleneck for\nself-stabilizing ranking usually is to detect if there exist agents with the\nsame rank.

    "abstract": "Sparse-view camera pose estimation, which aims to estimate the\n6-Degree-of-Freedom (6-DoF) poses from a limited number of images captured from\ndifferent viewpoints, is a fundamental yet challenging problem in remote\nsensing applications. Existing methods often overlook the translation\ninformation between each pair of viewpoints, leading to suboptimal performance\nin sparse-view scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce T-Graph, a\nlightweight, plug-and-play module to enhance camera pose estimation in\nsparse-view settings. T-graph takes paired image features as input and maps\nthem through a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). It then constructs a fully\nconnected translation graph, where nodes represent cameras and edges encode\ntheir translation relationships. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing\nmodels as an additional branch in parallel with the original prediction,\nmaintaining efficiency and ease of use. Furthermore, we introduce two pairwise\ntranslation representations, relative-t and pair-t, formulated under different\nlocal coordinate systems. While relative-t captures intuitive spatial\nrelationships, pair-t offers a rotation-disentangled alternative. The two\nrepresentations contribute to enhanced adaptability across diverse application\nscenarios, further improving our module's robustness. Extensive experiments on\ntwo state-of-the-art methods (RelPose++ and Forge) using public datasets (C03D\nand IMC PhotoTourism) validate both the effectiveness and generalizability of\nT-Graph. The results demonstrate consistent improvements across various\nmetrics, notably camera center accuracy, which improves by 1% to 6% from 2 to 8\nviewpoints.",

As a consequence, bootstrap based differentially private\ninference requires a significant increase of the privacy budget, which on the\nother hand comes with a substantial loss in statistical accuracy.\n  A potential solution to reconcile the conflicting goals of statistical\naccuracy and privacy is to analyze the data under parametric model assumptions\nand in the last decade, several parametric bootstrap methods for inference\nunder privacy have been investigated. However, uncertainty quantification by\nparametric bootstrap is only valid if the the quantities of interest can be\nidentified as the parameters of a statistical model and the imposed model\nassumptions are (at least approximately) satisfied. An alternative to\nparametric methods is the empirical bootstrap that is a widely used tool for\nnon-parametric inference and well studied in the non-private regime. However,\nunder privacy, less insight is available. In this paper, we propose a private\nempirical $m$ out of $n$ bootstrap and validate its consistency and privacy\nguarantees under Gaussian Differential Privacy. Compared to the the private $n$\nout of $n$ bootstrap, our approach has several advantages. First, it comes with\nless computational costs, in particular for massive data. Second, the proposed\nprocedure needs less additional noise in the bootstrap iterations, which leads\nto an improved statistical accuracy while asymptotically guaranteeing the same\nlevel of privacy.

Their\nproof restricts the model of computation to any algebraic decision tree model\nwhere the test functions have at most constant degree and at most a constant\nnumber of arguments. They rely upon involved algebraic arguments to construct a\nlower bound for each point set $P$ that matches the universal running time of\n[SICOMP'86].\n  We provide a different proof of universal optimality. Instead of restricting\nthe computational model, we further specify the output. We require as output\n(1) the convex hull, and (2) for each internal point of $P$ a witness for it\nbeing internal. Our argument is shorter, perhaps simpler, and applicable in\nmore general models of computation.",

Recently, Dawar, Jakl, and Reggio~(2021)\nproved that two graphs satisfy the same C^k_q-sentences if and only if they are\nhomomorphism indistinguishable over the class T^k_q of graphs admitting a\nk-pebble forest cover of depth q. After reproving this result using elementary\nmeans, we provide a graph-theoretic analysis of the graph class T^k_q. This\nallows us to separate T^k_q from the intersection TW_{k-1} \\cap TD_q, provided\nthat q is sufficiently larger than k. Here TW_{k-1} is the class of all graphs\nof treewidth at most k-1 and TD_q is the class of all graphs of treedepth at\nmost q.\n  We are able to lift this separation to a (semantic) separation of the\nrespective homomorphism indistinguishability relations \\equiv_{T^k_q} and\n\\equiv_{TW_{k-1} \\cap TD_q}. We do this by showing that the classes TD_q and\nT^k_q are homomorphism distinguishing closed, as conjectured by\nRoberson~(2022).\n  In order to prove Roberson's conjecture for T^k_q we characterise T^k_q in\nterms of a monotone Cops-and-Robber game. The crux is to prove that if Cop has\na winning strategy then Cop also has a winning strategy that is monotone. To\nthat end, we show how to transform Cops' winning strategy into a\npree-tree-decomposition, which is inspired by decompositions of matroids, and\nthen applying an intricate breadth-first `cleaning up' procedure along the\npree-tree-decomposition (which may temporarily lose the property of\nrepresenting a strategy), in order to achieve monotonicity while controlling\nthe number of rounds simultaneously across all branches of the decomposition\nvia a vertex exchange argument.",

Most research on Explainable AI (XAI) has\nfocused on feature-based explanations, with less attention on alternative\nstyles. Personality traits like the Need for Cognition (NFC) can also lead to\ndifferent decision-making outcomes among low and high NFC individuals. We\ninvestigated how presenting AI information (prediction, confidence, and\naccuracy) and different explanation styles (example-based, feature-based,\nrule-based, and counterfactual) affect accuracy, reliance on AI, and cognitive\nload in a loan application scenario. We also examined low and high NFC\nindividuals' differences in prioritizing XAI interface elements (loan\nattributes, AI information, and explanations), accuracy, and cognitive load.\nOur findings show that high AI confidence significantly increases reliance on\nAI while reducing cognitive load. Feature-based explanations did not enhance\naccuracy compared to other conditions. Although counterfactual explanations\nwere less understandable, they enhanced overall accuracy, increasing reliance\non AI and reducing cognitive load when AI predictions were correct. Both low\nand high NFC individuals prioritized explanations after loan attributes,\nleaving AI information as the least important. However, we found no significant\ndifferences between low and high NFC groups in accuracy or cognitive load,\nraising questions about the role of personality traits in AI-assisted\ndecision-making.

    "abstract": "A continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based multi-group multicast communication\nsystem is investigated. An integral-based CAPA multi-group multicast\nbeamforming design is formulated for the maximization of the system energy\nefficiency (EE), subject to a minimum multicast SE constraint of each user\ngroup and a total transmit power constraint. To address this non-econvex\nfractional programming problem, the Dinkelbach's method is employed. Within the\nDinkelbach's framework, the non-convex group-wise multicast spectral efficiency\n(SE) constraint is first equivalently transformed into a tractable form with\nauxiliary variables. Then, an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD)-based\nalgorithm is developed to solve the reformulated problem. The CAPA beamforming\ndesign subproblem can be optimally solved via the Lagrangian dual method and\nthe calculus of variations (CoV) theory. It reveals that the optimal CAPA\nbeamformer should be a combination of all the groups' user channels. To further\nreduce the computational complexity, a low-complexity zero-forcing (ZF)-based\napproach is proposed. The closed-form ZF CAPA beamformer is derived using each\ngroup's most representative user channel to mitigate the inter-group\ninterference while ensuring the intra-group multicast performance. Then, the\nbeamforming design subproblem in the BCD-based algorithm becomes a convex power\nallocation subproblem, which can be efficiently solved. Numerical results\ndemonstrate that 1) the CAPA can significantly improve the EE compared to\nconventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs); 2) due to the enhanced spatial\nresolutions, increasing the aperture size of CAPA is not always beneficial for\nEE enhancement in multicast scenarios; and 3) wider user distributions of each\ngroup cause a significant EE degradation of CAPA compared to SPDA.",

Meanwhile, as the holographic array usually has\nlarge physical size, the possibility of near-field communication increases.\nThis paper investigates a near-field multi-user downlink HMIMO system and\ncharacterizes the spectral efficiency (SE) under the mutual coupling effect\nover Ricean fading channels. Both perfect and imperfect channel state\ninformation (CSI) scenarios are considered. (i) For the perfect CSI case, the\nmutual coupling and radiation efficiency model are first established. Then, the\nclosed-form SE is derived under maximum ratio transmission (MRT). By comparing\nthe SE between the cases with and without mutual coupling, it is unveiled that\nthe system SE with mutual coupling might outperform that without mutual\ncoupling in the low transmit power regime for a given aperture size. Moreover,\nit is also unveiled that the inter-user interference cannot be eliminated\nunless the physical size of the array increases to infinity. Fortunately, the\nadditional distance term in the near-field channel can be exploited for the\ninter-user interference mitigation, especially for the worst case, where the\nusers' angular positions overlap to a great extent. (ii) For the imperfect CSI\ncase, the channel estimation error is considered for the derivation of the\nclosed-form SE under MRT. It shows that in the low transmit power regime, the\nsystem SE can be enhanced by increasing the pilot power and the antenna element\ndensity, the latter of which will lead to severe mutual coupling. In the high\ntransmit power regime, increasing the pilot power has a limited effect on\nimproving the system SE.

    "abstract": "Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) has recently emerged as a promising\nsolution for intelligent decision-making in vehicular networks, helping to\naddress challenges such as limited communication resources, high vehicle\nmobility, and data heterogeneity. However, HFL remains vulnerable to\nadversarial and unreliable vehicles, whose misleading updates can significantly\ncompromise the integrity and convergence of the global model. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel defense framework that integrates dynamic\nvehicle selection with robust anomaly detection within a cluster-based HFL\narchitecture, specifically designed to counter Gaussian noise and gradient\nascent attacks. The framework performs a comprehensive reliability assessment\nfor each vehicle by evaluating historical accuracy, contribution frequency, and\nanomaly records. Anomaly detection combines Z-score and cosine similarity\nanalyses on model updates to identify both statistical outliers and directional\ndeviations in model updates. To further refine detection, an adaptive\nthresholding mechanism is incorporated into the cosine similarity metric,\ndynamically adjusting the threshold based on the historical accuracy of each\nvehicle to enforce stricter standards for consistently high-performing\nvehicles. In addition, a weighted gradient averaging mechanism is implemented,\nwhich assigns higher weights to gradient updates from more trustworthy\nvehicles. To defend against coordinated attacks, a cross-cluster consistency\ncheck is applied to identify collaborative attacks in which multiple\ncompromised clusters coordinate misleading updates. Together, these mechanisms\nform a multi-level defense strategy to filter out malicious contributions\neffectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly\nreduces convergence time compared to benchmark methods across both 1-hop and\n3-hop topologies.",

Then, the motion guidance is\nincorporated into the blank-background motion generators with two\nmodifications, resulting in scene-aware text-driven motion sequences. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our proposed\nframework. We release our code in \\href{https://tstmotion.github.io/}{Project\nPage}.",

Visual working memory\nhas particularly benefited from this approach: analyses of VWM errors have\nproven crucial for understanding VWM capacity and coding schemes, in turn\nconstraining neural models of both. One poorly understood class of VWM errors\nare swap errors, whereby participants recall an uncued item from memory. Swap\nerrors could arise from erroneous memory encoding, noisy storage, or errors at\nretrieval time - previous research has mostly implicated the latter two.\nHowever, these studies made strong a priori assumptions on the detailed\nmechanisms and/or parametric form of errors contributed by these sources. Here,\nwe pursue a data-driven approach instead, introducing a Bayesian non-parametric\nmixture model of swap errors (BNS) which provides a flexible descriptive model\nof swapping behaviour, such that swaps are allowed to depend on both the probed\nand reported features of every stimulus item. We fit BNS to the trial-by-trial\nbehaviour of human participants and show that it recapitulates the strong\ndependence of swaps on cue similarity in multiple datasets. Critically, BNS\nreveals that this dependence coexists with a non-monotonic modulation in the\nreport feature dimension for a random dot motion direction-cued,\nlocation-reported dataset. The form of the modulation inferred by BNS opens new\nquestions about the importance of memory encoding in causing swap errors in\nVWM, a distinct source to the previously suggested binding and cueing errors.\nOur analyses, combining qualitative comparisons of the highly interpretable BNS\nparameter structure with rigorous quantitative model comparison and recovery\nmethods, show that previous interpretations of swap errors may have been\nincomplete.",

It necessitates the use of local information from the original\nshort frames to enhance visual and motion quality, and global information from\nthe entire long frames to ensure appearance consistency. Existing training-free\nmethods struggle to effectively integrate the benefits of both, as appearance\nand motion in videos are closely coupled, leading to motion inconsistency and\nvisual quality. In this paper, we reveal that global and local information can\nbe precisely decoupled into consistent appearance and motion intensity\ninformation by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), allowing for\nrefined complementary integration of global consistency and local quality. With\nthis insight, we propose FreePCA, a training-free long video generation\nparadigm based on PCA that simultaneously achieves high consistency and\nquality. Concretely, we decouple consistent appearance and motion intensity\nfeatures by measuring cosine similarity in the principal component space.\nCritically, we progressively integrate these features to preserve original\nquality and ensure smooth transitions, while further enhancing consistency by\nreusing the mean statistics of the initial noise.

A total of 92\nbinary and two hierarchical triple star systems are identified among the 745\ntarget stars whose multiplicity is explored in this study, all at distances of\nless than 500pc around the Sun. As expected for components of gravitationally\nbound star systems, the targets and the detected companions are at the same\ndistance and share a common proper motion, as shown by their accurate Gaia\nastrometry. The companions have masses of about 0.12 to 1.6$M_\\odot$. and are\nmost frequently found in the mass range up to 0.6$M_\\odot$. The companions have\nprojected separations from the targets between about 110 and 9600au. Their\nfrequency is highest and constant from about 300 to 800au, decreasing at larger\nprojected separations. In addition to main sequence stars, five white dwarf\ncompanions are detected in this study, whose true nature is unveiled by their\nphotometric properties.",

    "abstract": "Criminal activity data are typically available via a three-way tensor\nencoding the reported frequencies of different crime categories across time and\nspace. The challenges that arise in the design of interpretable, yet realistic,\nmodel-based representations of the complex dependencies within and across these\nthree dimensions have led to an increasing adoption of black-box predictive\nstrategies. Although this perspective has proved successful in producing\naccurate forecasts guiding targeted interventions, the lack of interpretable\nmodel-based characterizations of the dependence structures underlying criminal\nactivity tensors prevents from inferring the cascading effects of these\ninterventions across the different dimensions. We address this gap through the\ndesign of a low-rank bilinear autoregressive model which achieves comparable\npredictive performance to black-box strategies, while allowing interpretable\ninference on the dependence structures of criminal activity reports across\ncrime categories, time, and space. This representation incorporates the time\ndimension via an autoregressive construction, accounting for spatial effects\nand dependencies among crime categories through a separable low-rank bilinear\nformulation. When applied to Chicago police reports, the proposed model\nshowcases remarkable predictive performance and also reveals interpretable\ndependence structures unveiling fundamental crime dynamics. These results\nfacilitate the design of more refined intervention policies informed by\ncascading effects of the policy itself.",

Purpose: Treatment monitoring is of special interest for lung\ncancer therapy, however the helium range might not always be sufficient to exit\nthe patient distally. Therefore mixed beam use cases of several patient sites\nare considered. Methods: An extension to the open-source planning toolkit,\nmatRad allows for calculation and optimization of mixed beam treatment plans.\nThe use of the mixed beam method in 15 patients with lung cancer, as well as in\na prostate and liver case, for various potential beam configurations was\ninvestigated. Planning strategies to optimize the residual helium range\nconsidering the sensitive energy range of the imaging detector were developed.\nA strategy involves adding helium to energies whose range is sufficient.\nAnother one is to use range shifters to increase the helium energy and thus\nrange. Results: In most patient cases, the residual helium range of at least\none spot is too low. All investigated planning strategies can be used to ensure\na high enough helium range while still keeping a low helium dose and a\nsatisfactory total mixed carbon-helium beam dose. The use of range shifters\nallows for the detection of more spots. Conclusion: The mixed beam method shows\npromising results for online motioning. The use of range shifters ensures a\nhigh enough helium range and more detectable spots, allowing for a wider-spread\napplication.",

TinyML facilitates the on-device execution of the inference phase\nof ML algorithms on embedded and wearable devices, and more recently, it has\nexpanded into On-device Learning (ODL), which allows both inference and\nlearning phases to occur directly on the device. The application of ODL\ntechniques to wearable devices is particularly compelling, as it enables the\ndevelopment of more personalized models that adapt based on the data of the\nuser. However, one of the major challenges of ODL algorithms is the scarcity of\nlabeled data collected on-device. In smart wearable contexts, requiring users\nto manually label large amounts of data is often impractical and could lead to\nuser disengagement with the technology. To address this issue, this paper\nexplores the application of Active Learning (AL) techniques, i.e., techniques\nthat aim at minimizing the labeling effort, by actively selecting from a large\nquantity of unlabeled data only a small subset to be labeled and added to the\ntraining set of the algorithm. In particular, we propose TActiLE, a novel AL\nalgorithm that selects from the stream of on-device sensor data the ones that\nwould help the ML algorithm improve the most once coupled with labels provided\nby the user.

By introducing the polarization factor (PF),\ndefined in terms of the conditional entropy of the channel output under various\ninput configurations, we demonstrate that the symmetric capacities of the\npolarized subchannels can be uniformly expressed as functions of the PF. The\nexplicit formulation of the PF as a function of the block length and subchannel\nindex is derived. Furthermore, an efficient algorithm is proposed for the\ncomputation of the PF. Notably, we establish a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween each PF and an $n$-ary tree. Leveraging this tree structure, we develop\na pruning method to determine the conditional entropy associated with different\ninput relationships. The proposed polarization framework offers both\ntheoretical insights and practical advantages, including intuitive\nvisualization of polarization behavior and efficient polar code construction.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that enables the\nefficient computation of symmetric capacities for all subchannels in arbitrary\nBMCs.",

To generate new insights into this problem, we present a\nspatial Markov jump process model of savanna forest fires that integrates key\necological processes, including seed dispersal, fire spread, and non-linear\nvegetation flammability. In contrast to many models of forest-savanna\nbistability, we explicitly model both fire dynamics and vegetation regrowth in\na mathematically tractable framework. This approach bridges the gap between\nslow-timescale vegetation models and highly resolved fire dynamics, shedding\nlight on the influence of short-term and transient processes on vegetation\ncover. In our spatial stochastic model, bistability arises from periodic fires\nthat maintain low forest cover, whereas dense forest areas inhibit fire spread\nand preserve high tree density. The deterministic mean-field approximation of\nthe model similarly predicts bistability, but deviates quantitatively from the\nfully spatial model, especially in terms of its transient dynamics. These\nresults also underscore the critical role of timescale separation between fire\nand vegetation processes in shaping ecosystem structure and resilience.",

    "abstract": "Harmful algal blooms are a growing threat to inland water quality and public\nhealth worldwide, creating an urgent need for efficient, accurate, and\ncost-effective detection methods. This research introduces a high-performing\nmethodology that integrates multiple open-source remote sensing data with\nadvanced artificial intelligence models. Key data sources include Copernicus\nSentinel-2 optical imagery, the Copernicus Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and\nNOAA's High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) climate data, all efficiently\nretrieved using platforms like Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Microsoft\nPlanetary Computer (MPC). The NIR and two SWIR bands from Sentinel-2, the\naltitude from the elevation model, the temperature and wind from NOAA as well\nas the longitude and latitude were the most important features. The approach\ncombines two types of machine learning models, tree-based models and a neural\nnetwork, into an ensemble for classifying algal bloom severity. While the tree\nmodels performed strongly on their own, incorporating a neural network added\nrobustness and demonstrated how deep learning models can effectively use\ndiverse remote sensing inputs. The method leverages high-resolution satellite\nimagery and AI-driven analysis to monitor algal blooms dynamically, and\nalthough initially developed for a NASA competition in the U.S., it shows\npotential for global application.

Lower floating\npoint precision offers the potential for significant performance improvements,\nbut the uncertainty added from reducing the numerical precision is a major\nobstacle for it to reach prevalence in high-fidelity simulations of turbulence.\nIn the present work, the impact of reducing the numerical precision under\ndifferent rounding schemes is investigated and compared to the presence of\nwhite noise in the simulation data to obtain statistical averages of different\nquantities in the flow. To investigate how this impacts the simulation, an\nexperimental methodology to assess the impact of these sources of uncertainty\nis proposed, in which each realization $u^i$ at time $t_i$ is perturbed, either\nby constraining the flow to a coarser discretization of the phase space\n(corresponding to low precision formats rounded with deterministic and\nstochastic rounding) or by perturbing the flow with white noise with a uniform\ndistribution. The purpose of this approach is to assess the limiting factors\nfor precision, and how robust a direct numerical simulation (DNS) is to noise\nand numerical precision. Our results indicate that for low-Re turbulent channel\nflow, stochastic rounding and noise impacts the results significantly less than\ndeterministic rounding, indicating potential benefits of stochastic rounding\nover conventional round-to-nearest.

This research introduces a novel methodology for aggregating\nsingle-modality distributions by exploiting the principle of consensus of\ndependent experts (CoDE), which circumvents the aforementioned assumption.\nUtilizing the CoDE method, we propose a novel ELBO that approximates the joint\nlikelihood of the multimodal data by learning the contribution of each subset\nof modalities.

In this paper, we perform a Bayesian\ninference of the parameters of the Starobinsky or Higgs inflationary model with\nnon-instantaneous reheating using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. For the\nanalysis, we use observational data on the cosmic microwave background\ncollected by the Planck and ACT collaborations and on baryonic acoustic\noscillations from the DESI collaboration. The reheating stage is modelled by a\nsingle parameter $R_{\\rm reh}$. Using the modified Boltzmann code CLASS and the\ncobaya software with the GetDist package, we perform a direct inference of the\nmodel parameter space and obtain their posterior distributions. Using the\nKullback--Leibler divergence, we estimate the information gain from the data,\nyielding $2.52$ bits for the reheating parameter. Inclusion of the ACT DR6 data\nprovides $75\\%$ more information about the reheating stage compared to analysis\nwithout ACT data. We draw constraints on the reheating temperature and the\naverage equation of state. While the former can vary within $10$ orders of\nmagnitude, values in the $95\\%$ credible interval indicate a sufficiently low\nreheating temperature; for the latter there is a clear preference for values\ngreater than $0.5$, which means that the conventional equations of state for\ndust $\\omega=0$ and relativistic matter $\\omega=1/3$ are excluded with more\nthan $2\\sigma$ level of significance. However, there still is a big part of\nparameter space where Starobinsky and Higgs inflationary models exhibit a high\ndegree of consistency with the latest observational data, particularly from ACT\nDR6.

    "abstract": "Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is widely considered a\nleading waveform candidate for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in\n6G networks. However, the cyclic prefix (CP) used to mitigate multipath effects\nin communication systems also limits the maximum sensing range. Target echoes\narriving beyond the CP length cause inter-symbol interference (ISI) and\ninter-carrier interference (ICI), which degrade the mainlobe level and raise\nsidelobe levels in the range-Doppler map (RDM). This paper presents a unified\nanalytical framework to characterize the ISI and ICI caused by an insufficient\nCP length in multi-target scenarios. For the first time, we derive closed-form\nexpressions for the second-order moments of the RDM under both matched\nfiltering (MF) and reciprocal filtering (RF) processing with insufficient CP\nlength. These expressions quantify the effects of CP length, symbol\nconstellation, and inter-target interference (ITI) on the mainlobe and sidelobe\nlevels. Based on these results, we further derive explicit formulas for the\npeak sidelobe level ratio (PSLR) and integrated sidelobe level ratio (ISLR) of\nthe RDM, revealing a fundamental trade-off between noise amplification in RF\nand ITI in MF. Numerical results validate our theoretical derivations and\nillustrate the critical impact of insufficient CP length on sensing performance\nin OFDM-ISAC systems.",

First,\ndata access is only available for research on systemic risks affecting European\ncitizens, a concept with high levels of legal uncertainty. Second, data access\nsuffers from an inherent standoff problem. Researchers need to request specific\ndata but are not in a position to know all internal data processed by VLOPs,\nwho, in turn, expect data specificity for potential access. In light of these\nlimitations, data access under the DSA remains a mystery. To contribute to the\ndiscussion of how Article 40 can be interpreted and applied, we provide a\nconcrete illustration of what data access can look like in a real-world\nsystemic risk case study. We focus on the 2024 Romanian presidential election\ninterference incident, the first event of its kind to trigger systemic risk\ninvestigations by the European Commission. During the elections, one candidate\nis said to have benefited from TikTok algorithmic amplification through a\ncomplex dis- and misinformation campaign.

Post-training quantization (PTQ), a widely used method\nfor compressing LLMs, encounters severe accuracy degradation and diminished\ngeneralization performance when applied to MoE models.

    "abstract": "RWKV is a modern RNN architecture with comparable performance to Transformer,\nbut still faces challenges when deployed to resource-constrained devices. Post\nTraining Quantization (PTQ), which is a an essential technique to reduce model\nsize and inference latency, has been widely used in Transformer models.\nHowever, it suffers significant degradation of performance when applied to\nRWKV. This paper investigates and identifies two key constraints inherent in\nthe properties of RWKV: (1) Non-linear operators hinder the parameter-fusion of\nboth smooth- and rotation-based quantization, introducing extra computation\noverhead. (2) The larger amount of uniformly distributed weights poses\nchallenges for cluster-based quantization, leading to reduced accuracy. To this\nend, we propose RWKVQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for RWKV models, consisting\nof two novel techniques: (1) a coarse-to-fine proxy capable of adaptively\nselecting different quantization approaches by assessing the uniformity and\nidentifying outliers in the weights, and (2) a codebook optimization algorithm\nthat enhances the performance of cluster-based quantization methods for\nelement-wise multiplication in RWKV. Experiments show that RWKVQuant can\nquantize RWKV-6-14B into about 3-bit with less than 1% accuracy loss and 2.14x\nspeed up.",

Firstly, we designed a Hebbian learning module driven by place cells\nto save and replay historical information, aiming to restore the details of\nhistorical representations and solve the issue of scene fuzziness. Secondly, we\nutilized the head direction cell-inspired internal direction learning as\nmulti-head attention embedding to help restore the true orientation in similar\nscenes. Finally, we added a 3D grid center prediction in the pose regression\nmodule to reduce the final wrong prediction. We evaluate the proposed NeuroLoc\non commonly used benchmark indoor and outdoor datasets.

It consists of dividing each slide into\npatches, which are treated as a bag of instances labeled with a global label.\nMIL includes two main approaches: instance-based and embedding-based. In the\nformer, each patch is classified independently, and then the patch scores are\naggregated to predict the bag label. In the latter, bag classification is\nperformed after aggregating patch embeddings. Even if instance-based methods\nare naturally more interpretable, embedding-based MILs have usually been\npreferred in the past due to their robustness to poor feature extractors.\nHowever, recently, the quality of feature embeddings has drastically increased\nusing self-supervised learning (SSL). Nevertheless, many authors continue to\nendorse the superiority of embedding-based MIL. To investigate this further, we\nconduct 710 experiments across 4 datasets, comparing 10 MIL strategies, 6\nself-supervised methods with 4 backbones, 4 foundation models, and various\npathology-adapted techniques. Furthermore, we introduce 4 instance-based MIL\nmethods never used before in the pathology domain. Through these extensive\nexperiments, we show that with a good SSL feature extractor, simple\ninstance-based MILs, with very few parameters, obtain similar or better\nperformance than complex, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding-based MIL methods,\nsetting new SOTA results on the BRACS and Camelyon16 datasets. Since simple\ninstance-based MIL methods are naturally more interpretable and explainable to\nclinicians, our results suggest that more effort should be put into\nwell-adapted SSL methods for WSI rather than into complex embedding-based MIL\nmethods.",

In this context, we introduce the Competitive/Collaborative\nFusion of Experts (CoCoAFusE), a novel, Bayesian Covariates-Dependent Modeling\ntechnique. CoCoAFusE builds on the very philosophy behind Mixtures of Experts\n(MoEs), blending predictions from several simple sub-models (or \"experts\") to\nachieve high levels of expressiveness while retaining a substantial degree of\nlocal interpretability. Our formulation extends that of a classical Mixture of\nExperts by contemplating the fusion of the experts' distributions in addition\nto their more usual mixing (i.e., superimposition). Through this additional\nfeature, CoCoAFusE better accommodates different scenarios for the intermediate\nbehavior between generating mechanisms, resulting in tighter credible bounds on\nthe response variable. Indeed, only resorting to mixing, as in classical MoEs,\nmay lead to multimodality artifacts, especially over smooth transitions.\nInstead, CoCoAFusE can avoid these artifacts even under the same structure and\npriors for the experts, leading to greater expressiveness and flexibility in\nmodeling.

This effect is generally attributed to\nthe rotational modulation of the ablation rate, which is caused by the\ntime-varying cross section area presented by a nonspherical rotating meteoroid\nto the oncoming airflow. In this work we investigate the effects that the\nrotation of a meteoroid of given shape (spherical, cubic, or cylindrical) has\non the meteor's light curve, given state-of-the-art experimental laboratory\nestimates of the drag and lift coefficients of hypersonic flow (Mach number >\n5) around various shaped objects. The meteoroid's shape is important in\ndetermining these two forces, due to the different response of the drag and\nlift coefficients according to the angle of attack. As a case study, the model\nwas applied to a fireball observed on 2018 April 17 by the PRISMA network, a\nsystem of all-sky cameras that achieves a systematic monitoring of meteors and\nfireballs in the skies over the Italian territory. The results show that this\nmethodology is potentially able to yield a powerful diagnostic of the rotation\nrate of meteoroids prior to their encounter with the atmosphere, while also\nproviding essential information on their pre-fall actual shapes.",

However, such an idea faces two primary\nchallenges that adversely affect the performance of existing methods. The first\nchallenge relates to the interaction and cooperation between low-rank and\nsparse matrices, while the second involves determining weight allocation across\ndifferent layers, as redundancy varies considerably among them. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel two-stage LLM compression method with the\ncapability of global rank and sparsity optimization. It is noteworthy that the\noverall optimization space is vast, making comprehensive optimization\ncomputationally prohibitive. Therefore, to reduce the optimization space, our\nfirst stage utilizes robust principal component analysis to decompose the\nweight matrices of LLMs into low-rank and sparse components, which span the low\ndimensional and sparse spaces containing the resultant low-rank and sparse\nmatrices, respectively. In the second stage, we propose a probabilistic global\noptimization technique to jointly identify the low-rank and sparse structures\nwithin the above two spaces. The appealing feature of our approach is its\nability to automatically detect the redundancy across different layers and to\nmanage the interaction between the sparse and low-rank components.

    "abstract": "Sparse ridge regression is widely utilized in modern data analysis and\nmachine learning. However, computing globally optimal solutions for sparse\nridge regression is challenging, particularly when samples are arbitrarily\ngiven or generated under weak modeling assumptions. This paper proposes a novel\ncut-generation method, Screening Cut Generation (SCG), to eliminate non-optimal\nsolutions for arbitrarily given samples. In contrast to recent safe variable\nscreening approaches, SCG offers superior screening capability by identifying\nwhether a specific $\\{\\pm 1\\}$ combination of multiple features (binaries) lies\nin the set of optimal solutions. This identification is based on a convex\nrelaxation solution rather than directly solving the original sparse ridge\nregression. Hence, the cuts generated by SCG can be applied in the\npre-processing step of branch-and-bound and its variants to construct safe\nouter approximations of the optimal solution set. Numerical experiments are\nreported to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of\nSCG, particularly in hard real instances and synthetic instances with high\ndimensions, low ridge regularization parameters, or challenging modeling\nassumptions.",

    "abstract": "Faraday rotation measurements of extragalactic radio sources occulted by the\nsolar corona serve as a powerful complementary tool for probing the\npre-eruption electron density and magnetic field structure. These measurements\nthereby allow us to refine predictions from global MHD models. In this paper,\nwe discuss our recent study of the morphological evolution of a CME-driven\nshock event that occurred on August 3, 2012. Our analysis used white-light\ncoronagraphic observations from three different vantage points in space (SOHO\nand STEREO A and B). Obtaining data from these spacecraft, we derived key\nparameters such as the radius of curvature of the driving flux rope, the shock\nspeed, and the standoff distance from the CMEs' leading edge. A notable feature\nof this event was the availability of rare Faraday rotation measurements of a\ngroup of extragalactic radio sources occulted by the solar corona, which were\nobtained a few hours before the eruption. These observations from the VLA radio\ninterferometer provide independent information on the integrated product of the\nline-of-sight magnetic field component and electron density. By modeling the\nshock standoff distance and using constraints from the Faraday rotation\nmeasurements, we achieve a high level of agreement between the fast-mode Mach\nnumber predicted by the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS)\ncode in its thermodynamic mode and the value deduced from the analysis of the\n3D reconstruction of coronagraphic data, provided that appropriate correction\nfactors (f_b = 2.4 and f_n = 0.5) are applied in advance to scale the simulated\nmagnetic field and electron density, respectively.

We find that this bias cannot be satisfactorily addressed through finer\nstep sizes or longer self-consistency horizons.

For a fixed barrier\nheight, we find that the initial transversal fragmentation is essentially\nindependent of the asymmetry along the tunneling direction but reduces when the\nasymmetry is oriented orthogonally to the junction. We investigate the\ninterplay between the interference of fragmentations and asymmetry in the\njunction by analyzing the rate of density collapse in the survival probability,\nthe uncertainty product, and the nontrivial dynamics of the occupation of the\nfirst excited orbital. The interference of fragmentations is quantified by the\nratio between the reduction of transverse fragmentation and the development of\nlongitudinal fragmentation. We show that asymmetry along the junction\n(orthogonal to the junction) delays (accelerates), compared to the symmetric\npotential, in obtaining the maximal interference of fragmentations.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is a rapidly developing field that\nintegrates multimodal information to recognize sentiments, and existing models\nhave made significant progress in this area. The central challenge in MSA is\nmultimodal fusion, which is predominantly addressed by Multimodal Transformers\n(MulTs). Although act as the paradigm, MulTs suffer from efficiency concerns.\nIn this work, from the perspective of efficiency optimization, we propose and\nprove that MulTs are hierarchical modal-wise heterogeneous graphs (HMHGs), and\nwe introduce the graph-structured representation pattern of MulTs. Based on\nthis pattern, we propose an Interlaced Mask (IM) mechanism to design the\nGraph-Structured and Interlaced-Masked Multimodal Transformer (GsiT). It is\nformally equivalent to MulTs which achieves an efficient weight-sharing\nmechanism without information disorder through IM, enabling All-Modal-In-One\nfusion with only 1/3 of the parameters of pure MulTs. A Triton kernel called\nDecomposition is implemented to ensure avoiding additional computational\noverhead. Moreover, it achieves significantly higher performance than\ntraditional MulTs. To further validate the effectiveness of GsiT itself and the\nHMHG concept, we integrate them into multiple state-of-the-art models and\ndemonstrate notable performance improvements and parameter reduction on widely\nused MSA datasets.",

We construct approximate\nsolutions to these equations and study how physical properties of the\nsolutions, such as the angular velocity, photon sphere, black hole shadow, and\ninnermost stable circular orbit, are modified, working to leading order in the\ncoupling constant and the rotation parameter.

This\npaper presents a hierarchical concept map-based framework that provides\nstructured knowledge to guide LLMs in generating MCQs with distractors. We\nchose high-school physics as our test domain and began by developing a\nhierarchical concept map covering major Physics topics and their\ninterconnections with an efficient database design.

Lastly, an automated validation is\ncompleted to ensure that the generated MCQs meet the requirements provided. We\nevaluate our framework against two baseline approaches: a base LLM and a\nRAG-based generation. We conducted expert evaluations and student assessments\nof the generated MCQs. Expert evaluation shows that our method significantly\noutperforms the baseline approaches, achieving a success rate of 75.20% in\nmeeting all quality criteria compared to approximately 37% for both baseline\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Existing edge detection methods often suffer from noise amplification and\nexcessive retention of non-salient details, limiting their applicability in\nhigh-precision industrial scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose\nCAM-EDIT, a novel framework that integrates Channel Attention Mechanism (CAM)\nand Edge Detection via Independence Testing (EDIT). The CAM module adaptively\nenhances discriminative edge features through multi-channel fusion, while the\nEDIT module employs region-wise statistical independence analysis (using\nFisher's exact test and chi-square test) to suppress uncorrelated\nnoise.Extensive experiments on BSDS500 and NYUDv2 datasets demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance. Among the nine comparison algorithms, the\nF-measure scores of CAM-EDIT are 0.635 and 0.460, representing improvements of\n19.2\\% to 26.5\\% over traditional methods (Canny, CannySR), and better than the\nlatest learning based methods (TIP2020, MSCNGP). Noise robustness evaluations\nfurther reveal a 2.2\\% PSNR improvement under Gaussian noise compared to\nbaseline methods. Qualitative results exhibit cleaner edge maps with reduced\nartifacts, demonstrating its potential for high-precision industrial\napplications.",

Our goal is to extend the classical theory of\nregular languages - defined over finite words and characterized by automata,\nmonadic second-order logic, and regular expressions - to the setting of\ncountable words. In this paper, we introduce and study five classes of\nexpressions: marked star-free expressions, marked expressions, power-free\nexpressions, scatter-free expressions, and scatter expressions. We show that\nthese expression classes characterize natural fragments of logic over countable\nwords and possess decidable algebraic characterizations. As part of our\nalgebraic analysis, we provide a precise description of the relevant classes in\nterms of their J-class structure.

This approach significantly improves token\nefficiency, mitigates information loss due to random sampling, and enhances\nperformance on graph-based tasks such as node classification and link\nprediction.

Our\nresults confirm the statistical equivalence between the HS approach and the\nRDF-based aberration term method, with both producing close near-focal-plane\ndistributions and focal volume characteristics. By establishing this\nequivalence, we validate that surface roughness effects can be accurately\nrepresented as deterministic aberration terms while maintaining fidelity to\nestablished statistical scattering models.",

In this\npaper we calculate the electron capture rates on isotopes of chromium with mass\nrange $42\\leq A \\leq 65$, including neutron-deficient and neutron-rich\nisotopes. For the calculation of weak rates in stellar matter, we used the\npn-QRPA model with separable Gamow-Teller forces and took deformation of\nnucleus into consideration. A recent study proved this form of pn-QRPA to be\nthe best for calculation of GT strength distributions amongst the pn-QRPA\nmodels. The stellar weak rates are calculated over a broad range of temperature\n$(0.01 \\times 10^{9}-30 \\times 10^{9} (K))$ and density\n$(10-10^{11}(g/cm^{3}))$ domain.

However, existing work in heterogeneous and complex software\nprojects continues to face challenges, such as struggling with heterogeneous\ncommit structures and ignoring cross-line dependencies in code changes, which\nultimately reduce the accuracy of defect identification. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an approach called RC_Detector.

The bug-fixing graph construction component identifies the code\nsyntax structures and program dependencies within bug-fixing commits and\ntransforms them into heterogeneous graph formats by converting the source code\ninto vector representations. The code semantic aggregation component adapts to\nheterogeneous data by using heterogeneous attention to learn the hidden\nsemantic representation of target code lines. The cross-line semantic retention\ncomponent regulates propagated semantic information by using attenuation and\nreinforcement gates derived from old and new code semantic representations,\neffectively preserving cross-line semantic relationships. Extensive experiments\nwere conducted to evaluate the performance of our model by collecting data from\n87 open-source projects, including 675 bug-fixing commits.

    "abstract": "The success of large pre-trained object detectors hinges on their\nadaptability to diverse downstream tasks. While fine-tuning is the standard\nadaptation method, specializing these models for challenging fine-grained\ndomains necessitates careful consideration of feature granularity. The critical\nquestion remains: how deeply should the pre-trained backbone be fine-tuned to\noptimize for the specialized task without incurring catastrophic forgetting of\nthe original general capabilities? Addressing this, we present a systematic\nempirical study evaluating the impact of fine-tuning depth. We adapt a standard\nYOLOv8n model to a custom, fine-grained fruit detection dataset by\nprogressively unfreezing backbone layers (freeze points at layers 22, 15, and\n10) and training. Performance was rigorously evaluated on both the target fruit\ndataset and, using a dual-head evaluation architecture, on the original COCO\nvalidation set. Our results demonstrate unequivocally that deeper fine-tuning\n(unfreezing down to layer 10) yields substantial performance gains (e.g., +10\\%\nabsolute mAP50) on the fine-grained fruit task compared to only training the\nhead. Strikingly, this significant adaptation and specialization resulted in\nnegligible performance degradation (<0.1\\% absolute mAP difference) on the COCO\nbenchmark across all tested freeze levels. We conclude that adapting\nmid-to-late backbone features is highly effective for fine-grained\nspecialization. Critically, our results demonstrate this adaptation can be\nachieved without the commonly expected penalty of catastrophic forgetting,\npresenting a compelling case for exploring deeper fine-tuning strategies,\nparticularly when targeting complex domains or when maximizing specialized\nperformance is paramount.",

    "abstract": "Planning is essential for artificial intelligence systems to look ahead and\nproactively determine a course of actions to reach objectives in the virtual\nand real world. Recent work on large language models (LLMs) sheds light on\ntheir planning capability in various tasks. However, it remains unclear what\nsignals in the context influence the model performance. In this work, we\nexplore how to improve the model planning capability through in-context\nlearning (ICL), specifically, what signals can help select the exemplars.\nThrough extensive experiments, we observe that commonly used problem similarity\nmay result in false positives with drastically different plans, which can\nmislead the model. In response, we propose to sample and filter exemplars\nleveraging plan side action sequence similarity (AS). We propose GRASE-DC: a\ntwo-stage pipeline that first re-samples high AS exemplars and then curates the\nselected exemplars with dynamic clustering on AS to achieve a balance of\nrelevance and diversity. Our experimental result confirms that GRASE-DC\nachieves significant performance improvement on various planning tasks (up to\n~11-40 point absolute accuracy improvement with 27.3% fewer exemplars needed on\naverage). With GRASE-DC* + VAL, where we iteratively apply GRASE-DC with a\nvalidator, we are able to even boost the performance by 18.9% more.\n  Extensive analysis validates the consistent performance improvement of\nGRASE-DC with various backbone LLMs and on both classical planning and natural\nlanguage planning benchmarks. GRASE-DC can further boost the planning accuracy\nby ~24 absolute points on harder problems using simpler problems as exemplars\nover a random baseline. This demonstrates its ability to generalize to\nout-of-distribution problems.",

However, Transformer-based\nmethods either ignore the spatial neighborhood relationships between the joints\nwhen used for skeleton representations or disregard the local temporal patterns\nof the local joint movements in skeleton sequence modeling, while GCN-based\nmethods often neglect the need for pose-specific representations. To address\nthese problems, we propose a new method that exploits the graph modeling\ncapability of GCN to represent each skeleton with multiple graphs of different\norders, incorporated with a newly introduced Graph Order Attention module that\ndynamically emphasizes the most representative orders for each joint. The\nresulting spatial features of the sequence are further processed using a\nproposed temporal Body Aware Transformer that models the global body feature\ndependencies in the sequence with awareness of the local inter-skeleton feature\ndependencies of joints. Given that our 3D pose output aligns with the central\n2D pose in the sequence, we improve the self-attention mechanism to be aware of\nthe central pose while diminishing its focus gradually towards the first and\nthe last poses. Extensive experiments on Human3.6m, MPIINF-3DHP, and HumanEva-I\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code and models\nare made available on Github.",

These photons interact with\nanother nucleus via photon-nuclear interactions, producing vector mesons. These\nvector mesons possess extremely low transverse momentum (pT ~ 0.1 GeV/c),\ndistinguishing them from particles produced via hadronic interactions. STAR and\nALICE have observed J/psi, rho0 and other vector mesons with very low pT, which\nare well described by photoproduction models. This unique characteristic of\nhaving extremely low transverse momentum allows them to serve as a novel\nexperimental probe. Recent STAR results show that the equivalent photons in\nphotoproduction processes are fully linearly polarized, affecting the azimuthal\ndistribution of final-state particles like rho0 -> pi+ pi-. Since the\npolarization links to the initial collision geometry, the rho0 azimuthal\nmodulation can probe nuclear structure. However, the post-collision magnetic\nfield may deflect these particles, distorting the azimuthal distribution and\ncomplicating structure measurements. We simulated the distribution of residual\nmagnetic fields over time under different collision conditions using UrQMD for\nAu+Au collisions at sqrt(sNN)=200 GeV and calculated their effects on the\nazimuthal modulation (<cos 2phi>) of photoproduced rho0. Our results show that\nin peripheral collisions, the field significantly alters the for photoproduced\nrho0 with pT ~ 0.1 GeV/c.

    "abstract": "Practical knowledge about troubleshooting and error handling in trapped-ion\nsystems remains largely undocumented and held within individual labs, creating\na barrier to cross-disciplinary collaboration towards engineering scalable\nsystems. This paper presents a structured troubleshooting framework for\ntrapping ions, developed through hands-on experience in the lab. The framework\ncategorizes standard failure modes across subsystems -- vacuum, electronics,\noptics, and imaging -- and organizes them into a modular decision-tree\nstructure. Each troubleshooting action is annotated with estimates of cost and\noperational risk inspired by the principles of Failure Mode and Effects\nAnalysis (FMEA). By categorizing failure modes and their associated costs, this\nwork bridges the gap between physicists and engineers, enabling collaborative\nsystem design and setting the stage for turning experimental setups into\nrobust, reproducible products. This framework provides a structured basis for\nfuture error-handled ion-trap systems, designed with diagnostics and\nmaintainability in mind -- for use in distributed quantum computing and\nnetworks.",

One important issue is the mismatch in\nlow-level controller dynamics, where identical trajectories can lead to vastly\ndifferent contact forces and behaviors when control parameters vary. Existing\napproaches often rely on manual tuning or controller randomization, which can\nbe labor-intensive, task-specific, and introduce significant training\ndifficulty. In this work, we propose a framework that jointly learns actions\nand controller parameters based on the historical information of both\ntrajectory and controller. This adaptive controller adjustment mechanism allows\nthe policy to automatically tune control parameters during execution, thereby\nmitigating the sim-to-real gap without extensive manual tuning or excessive\nrandomization. Moreover, by explicitly providing controller parameters as part\nof the observation, our approach facilitates better reasoning over force\ninteractions and improves robustness in real-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "The directed graph (digraph), as a generalization of undirected graphs,\nexhibits superior representation capability in modeling complex topology\nsystems and has garnered considerable attention in recent years. Despite the\nnotable efforts made by existing DiGraph Neural Networks (DiGNNs) to leverage\ndirected edges, they still fail to comprehensively delve into the abundant data\nknowledge concealed in the digraphs. This data-level limitation results in\nmodel-level sub-optimal predictive performance and underscores the necessity of\nfurther exploring the potential correlations between the directed edges\n(topology) and node profiles (feature and labels) from a data-centric\nperspective, thereby empowering model-centric neural networks with stronger\nencoding capabilities.\n  In this paper, we propose \\textbf{E}ntropy-driven \\textbf{D}igraph\nknowl\\textbf{E}dge distillatio\\textbf{N} (EDEN), which can serve as a\ndata-centric digraph learning paradigm or a model-agnostic hot-and-plug\ndata-centric Knowledge Distillation (KD) module. The core idea is to achieve\ndata-centric ML, guided by our proposed hierarchical encoding theory for\nstructured data. Specifically, EDEN first utilizes directed structural\nmeasurements from a topology perspective to construct a coarse-grained\nHierarchical Knowledge Tree (HKT). Subsequently, EDEN quantifies the mutual\ninformation of node profiles to refine knowledge flow in the HKT, enabling\ndata-centric KD supervision within model training. As a general framework, EDEN\ncan also naturally extend to undirected scenarios and demonstrate satisfactory\nperformance. In our experiments, EDEN has been widely evaluated on 14 (di)graph\ndatasets (homophily and heterophily) and across 4 downstream tasks. The results\ndemonstrate that EDEN attains SOTA performance and exhibits strong improvement\nfor prevalent (Di)GNNs.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems have rapidly evolved and become integral to many online\nservices. However, existing systems sometimes produce unstable and\nunsatisfactory recommendations that fail to align with users' fundamental and\nlong-term preferences. This is because they primarily focus on extracting\nshallow and short-term interests from user behavior data, which is inherently\ndynamic and challenging to model. Unlike these transient interests, user values\nare more stable and play a crucial role in shaping user behaviors, such as\npurchasing items and consuming content. Incorporating user values into\nrecommender systems can help stabilize recommendation performance and ensure\nresults better reflect users' latent preferences. However, acquiring user\nvalues is typically difficult and costly. To address this challenge, we\nleverage the strong language understanding, zero-shot inference, and\ngeneralization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract user\nvalues from users' historical interactions. Unfortunately, direct extraction\nusing LLMs presents several challenges such as length constraints and\nhallucination. To overcome these issues, we propose ZOOM, a zero-shot multi-LLM\ncollaborative framework for effective and accurate user value extraction. In\nZOOM, we apply text summarization techniques to condense item content while\npreserving essential meaning. To mitigate hallucinations, ZOOM introduces two\nspecialized agent roles: evaluators and supervisors, to collaboratively\ngenerate accurate user values. Extensive experiments on two widely used\nrecommendation datasets with two state-of-the-art recommendation models\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework in automatic\nuser value mining and recommendation performance improvement.",

Extensive\nexperiments on the NYUDv2 and KITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed LMDepth.

    "abstract": "Generating high-quality steganographic text is a fundamental challenge in the\nfield of generative linguistic steganography. This challenge arises primarily\nfrom two aspects: firstly, the capabilities of existing models in text\ngeneration are limited; secondly, embedding algorithms fail to effectively\nmitigate the negative impacts of sensitive information's properties, such as\nsemantic content or randomness. Specifically, to ensure that the recipient can\naccurately extract hidden information, embedding algorithms often have to\nconsider selecting candidate words with relatively low probabilities. This\nphenomenon leads to a decrease in the number of high-probability candidate\nwords and an increase in low-probability candidate words, thereby compromising\nthe semantic coherence and logical fluency of the steganographic text and\ndiminishing the overall quality of the generated steganographic material. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposes a novel embedding algorithm,\ncharacter-based diffusion embedding algorithm (CDEA). Unlike existing embedding\nalgorithms that strive to eliminate the impact of sensitive information's\nproperties on the generation process, CDEA leverages sensitive information's\nproperties. It enhances the selection frequency of high-probability candidate\nwords in the candidate pool based on general statistical properties at the\ncharacter level and grouping methods based on power-law distributions, while\nreducing the selection frequency of low-probability candidate words in the\ncandidate pool. Furthermore, to ensure the effective transformation of\nsensitive information in long sequences, we also introduce the XLNet model.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the combination of CDEA and XLNet\nsignificantly improves the quality of generated steganographic text,\nparticularly in terms of perceptual-imperceptibility.",

Here, we investigate\nlow-energy bulk excitations in the field-induced quantum disordered (FIQD)\nstate of newly available ultraclean single crystals of $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.\nHigh-resolution specific heat measurements under in-plane magnetic field\nrotation reveal an anisotropic excitation gap, whose field dependence is\nconsistent with the Majorana gap in the KQSL state. Remarkably, when the field\naligns with Ru-Ru bond directions, we observe gapless excitations with\nDirac-like dispersions that quantitatively match theoretical predictions of\nMajorana bands based on the reported Kitaev interactions. Our findings in these\nultraclean crystals provide strong evidence that the FIQD state of\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is a robust KQSL, resilient against small disorder\nperturbations.",

The both time bounds\ncan be de-randomized by a lookup data structure like a balanced search tree\nwith a logarithmic dependency on the alphabet size.

To bridge this gap, we first introduce a notion of ``importance''\nthat reflects how likely a counterexample can be found with a sub-problem, and\nthen we devise a novel verification approach, called ABONN, that explores the\nsub-problem space of BaB adaptively, in a Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) style.\nThe exploration is guided by the ``importance'' of different sub-problems, so\nit favors the sub-problems that are more likely to find counterexamples. As\nsoon as it finds a counterexample, it can immediately terminate; even though it\ncannot find, after visiting all the sub-problems, it can still manage to verify\nthe problem. We evaluate ABONN with 552 verification problems from\ncommonly-used datasets and neural network models, and compare it with the\nstate-of-the-art verifiers as baseline approaches.

    "abstract": "Accurate subnational estimation of health indicators is critical for public\nhealth planning, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where\ndata and tools are often limited. The sae4health R shiny app, built on the\nsurveyPrev package, provides a user-friendly tool for prevalence mapping using\nsmall area estimation (SAE) methods. Both area- and unit-level models with\nspatial random effects are available, with fast Bayesian inference performed\nusing Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). Currently, the app\nsupports analysis of over 150 indicators from Demographic and Health Surveys\n(DHS) across multiple administrative levels. sae4health simplifies the use of\ncomplex prevalence mapping models to support data-driven decision-making. The\napp provides interactive visualization, summary, and report generation\nfunctionalities for a wide range of use cases. This paper outlines the app's\nstatistical framework and demonstrates the workflow through a case study of\nchild stunting in Nigeria.

Like outfits, makeup, and\nfragrances, audio personas offer an alternative yet dynamic channel to augment\nface-to-face interactions. For instance, one can set their audio persona as\nrain sounds to reflect a bad mood, bee sounds to establish personal boundaries,\nor a playful \"woosh\" sound to mimic passing by someone like a breeze. To\ninstantiate the concept, we implemented a headphone-based prototype with\nmulti-user tracking and audio streaming. Our preregistered in-lab study with 64\nparticipants showed that audio personas influenced how participants formed\nimpressions. Individuals with positive audio personas were rated as more\nsocially attractive, more likable, and less threatening than those with\nnegative audio personas. Our study with audio designers revealed that audio\npersonas were preferred in public and semi-public-private spaces for managing\nsocial impressions (e.g., personality) and signaling current states (e.g.,\nemotions).",

Special attention is paid to the effect of the\nsecond-order anisotropy constant, K2, on the sensing performance. It is found\nthat the sensitivity is strongly enhanced by tuning the value of K2 close to\nthe boundary between the in-plane magnetized state and the conically magnetized\nstate.

These user representations are\nwidely used for a variety of downstream tasks to enhance users' online\nexperience. A key challenge for learning these representations is the lack of\nlabeled training data. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have\nemerged as a promising solution for learning representations from unlabeled\ndata, many existing approaches rely on extensive negative sampling, which can\nbe computationally expensive and may not always be feasible in real-world\nscenario. In this work, we propose an adaptation of Barlow Twins, a\nstate-of-the-art SSL methods, to user sequence modeling by incorporating\nsuitable augmentation methods. Our approach aims to mitigate the need for large\nnegative sample batches, enabling effective representation learning with\nsmaller batch sizes and limited labeled data. We evaluate our method on the\nMovieLens-1M, MovieLens-20M, and Yelp datasets, demonstrating that our method\nconsistently outperforms the widely-used dual encoder model across three\ndownstream tasks, achieving an 8%-20% improvement in accuracy.

To restore lost\nrecommendations related to obfuscated sensitive data, we design a\nde-obfuscation module that reconstructs sensitive recommendations locally.\nExperiments on real-world e-commerce datasets show that our framework achieves\nalmost the same recommendation utility with a system which shares all data with\nan LLM, while preserving privacy to a large extend. Compared to\nobfuscation-only techniques, our approach improves HR@10 scores and category\ndistribution alignment, offering a better balance between privacy and\nrecommendation quality.

The ability to rapidly detect them is useful both for\nquality control in engineered emitter arrays and for high-contrast imaging of\nnaturally occurring emitters. Using full photon-counting statistics and optimal\nBayesian hypothesis testing, we show that extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference\nbetween quantum emission and a coherent field enables orders-of-magnitude\nspeed-ups in emitter detection under realistic noise and loss. Strikingly, the\nperformance advantage improves as loss and background noise increase, and\npersists for incoherent emission.

This offers a new approach to fast, low-intensity imaging and for\nemitter characterization in large-scale quantum systems. Fundamentally, the\ndiscovery that quantum interference and measurements, used together, are more\nrobust to both loss and noise than standard measurement techniques opens the\npossibility of broad applications across quantum metrology.",

The study aims to assist in evaluating the\nstudents' process and outcomes on medical case diagnosis and discussion while\nincorporating the theoretical framework of Socially Shared Regulation of\nLearning (SSRL) to assess student performance.

Existing spectral graph-based methods\naddress this challenge by leveraging different graph filters to capture signals\nwith different frequencies in service networks. However, most graph\nfilter-based methods struggle with deriving clean and discriminative graph\nsignals. On the one hand, they overlook the noise in the information\npropagation process, resulting in degradation of filtering ability. On the\nother hand, they fail to discriminate the frequency-specific characteristics of\ngraph signals, leading to distortion of signals fusion. To address these\nissues, we develop a novel spectral graph network based on information\nbottleneck theory (SGNN-IB) for fraud detection in service networks. SGNN-IB\nsplits the original graph into homophilic and heterophilic subgraphs to better\ncapture the signals at different frequencies. For the first limitation, SGNN-IB\napplies information bottleneck theory to extract key characteristics of encoded\nrepresentations.

Holographic displays can generate ideal three-dimensional (3D)\nvirtual images and have recently shown rapid advancements, particularly in\nnoise reduction through learning-based approaches. However, these displays\nstill face challenges in improving image quality for AR scenarios because\nholographic virtual images are simply superimposed onto the real world, leading\nto a loss of contrast and visibility. To address this, an occlusion optics,\nwhich can mask designated areas of the real world, is incorporated into\nholographic AR displays. The proposed system employs a folded 4f system with a\ndigital micromirror device and sequentially operates as both a real-world mask\nand an active Fourier filter. This approach transforms traditionally\ntranslucent holographic images into perceptually opaque ones while\nsimultaneously eliminating unwanted noise terms from pixelated holographic\ndisplays. Furthermore, active Fourier filtering expands the virtual image field\nof view through time-multiplexed operation and supports a novel binary hologram\noptimization algorithm that performs especially well for sparse virtual\ncontent. The implementation successfully achieves opaque holographic 3D image\npresentation, significantly improving contrast and image quality while\nproducing highly realistic 3D AR scenes with optically cast shadows.",

The introduced frequency analysis based on Fourier transformation\ncould enhance the model's ability to capture crucial characteristics beyond the\ntime domain. To protect the training quality from anomalies and improve the\nrobustness, FreCT deploys stop-gradient Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and\nabsolute error to optimize consistency information in both time and frequency\ndomains.

In this paper, we propose\nStable Principal Component Analysis (StablePCA), a novel method for group\ndistributionally robust learning of latent representations from\nhigh-dimensional multi-source data. A primary challenge in generalizing PCA to\nthe multi-source regime lies in the nonconvexity of the fixed rank constraint,\nrendering the minimax optimization nonconvex.

To\nsolve the relaxed formulation, we devise an optimistic-gradient Mirror Prox\nalgorithm with explicit closed-form updates. Theoretically, we establish the\nglobal convergence of the Mirror Prox algorithm, with the convergence rate\nprovided from the optimization perspective. Furthermore, we offer practical\ncriteria to assess how closely the solution approximates the original nonconvex\nformulation.

This endeavor\nis only fruitful, however, if a forecast is \"close\" to the distribution it\nattempts to predict. The role of a loss function -- also known as a scoring\nrule -- is to make this precise by providing a quantitative measure of\nproximity between a forecast distribution and target random variable. Numerous\nloss functions have been proposed in the literature, with a strong focus on\nproper losses, that is, losses whose expectations are minimized when the\nforecast distribution is the same as the target. In this paper, we show that a\nbroad class of proper loss functions penalize asymmetrically, in the sense that\nunderestimating a given parameter of the target distribution can incur larger\nloss than overestimating it, or vice versa. Our theory covers many popular\nlosses, such as the logarithmic, continuous ranked probability, quadratic, and\nspherical losses, as well as the energy and threshold-weighted generalizations\nof continuous ranked probability loss. To complement our theory, we present\nexperiments with real epidemiological, meteorological, and retail forecast data\nsets.

This configuration, however, makes it challenging to separate\nsignal and idler waves and also renders their frequencies highly sensitive to\nexternal disturbances. Here, we demonstrate a degeneracy-locked OPO achieved\nthrough backward phase matching in a submicron periodically-poled thin-film\nlithium niobate microresonator. While the backward phase matching establishes\nfrequency degeneracy of the signal and idler, the backscattering in the\nwaveguide further ensures phase-locking between them. Their interplay permits\nthe locking of the OPO's degeneracy over a broad parameter space, resulting in\ndeterministic degenerate OPO initiation and robust operation against both pump\ndetuning and temperature fluctuations. This work thus provides a new approach\nfor synchronized operations in nonlinear photonics and extends the\nfunctionality of optical parametric oscillators. With its potential for\nlarge-scale integration, it provides a chip-based platform for advanced\napplications, such as squeezed light generation, coherent optical computing,\nand investigations of complex nonlinear phenomena.",

    "abstract": "The increase in available computing power and the Deep Learning revolution\nhave allowed the exploration of new topics and frontiers in Artificial\nIntelligence research. A new field called Embodied Artificial Intelligence,\nwhich places at the intersection of Computer Vision, Robotics, and Decision\nMaking, has been gaining importance during the last few years, as it aims to\nfoster the development of smart autonomous robots and their deployment in\nsociety. The recent availability of large collections of 3D models for\nphotorealistic robotic simulation has allowed faster and safe training of\nlearning-based agents for millions of frames and a careful evaluation of their\nbehavior before deploying the models on real robotic platforms. These\nintelligent agents are intended to perform a certain task in a possibly unknown\nenvironment. To this end, during the training in simulation, the agents learn\nto perform continuous interactions with the surroundings, such as gathering\ninformation from the environment, encoding and extracting useful cues for the\ntask, and performing actions towards the final goal; where every action of the\nagent influences the interactions. This dissertation follows the complete\ncreation process of embodied agents for indoor environments, from their concept\nto their implementation and deployment. We aim to contribute to research in\nEmbodied AI and autonomous agents, in order to foster future work in this\nfield. We present a detailed analysis of the procedure behind implementing an\nintelligent embodied agent, comprehending a thorough description of the current\nstate-of-the-art in literature, technical explanations of the proposed methods,\nand accurate experimental studies on relevant robotic tasks.",

Existing\ndetection approaches either rely on static model-based thresholds that overlook\ndynamic spatiotemporal (ST) usage patterns or employ supervised learning\nmethods that struggle with label scarcity and class imbalance. To address these\nlimitations, this paper proposes a novel Self-Supervised Transformer\n(SSTransformer) framework for automatically detecting unusable shared bikes,\nleveraging ST features extracted from GPS trajectories and trip records. The\nmodel incorporates a self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance its\nfeature extraction capabilities, followed by fine-tuning for efficient status\nrecognition.

Comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset of\n10,730 bikes (1,870 unusable, 8,860 normal) from Chengdu, China, demonstrate\nthat SSTransformer significantly outperforms traditional machine learning,\nensemble learning, and deep learning baselines, achieving the best accuracy\n(97.81%), precision (0.8889), and F1-score (0.9358).

Prior methods of\nassessing the fix condition rely on counterfactuals inferred from a Structural\nCausal Model (SCM) trained on historical data. But since anomalies are rare and\nfall outside the training distribution, the fitted SCMs yield unreliable\ncounterfactual estimates. IDI overcomes this by relying on interventional\nestimates obtained by solely probing the fitted SCM at in-distribution inputs.\nWe present a theoretical analysis comparing and bounding the errors in\nassessing the fix condition using interventional and counterfactual estimates.\nWe then conduct experiments by systematically varying the SCM's complexity to\ndemonstrate the cases where IDI's interventional approach outperforms the\ncounterfactual approach and vice versa.

However, these approached generally introduce additional\ncompute overhead that restricts them from being used for applications where\nlimited compute memory and power are of great concern (such as edge computing).\nWe propose a novel and efficient Compact Recurrent Transformer (CRT), which\ncombines shallow Transformer models that process short local segments with\nrecurrent neural networks to compress and manage a single persistent memory\nvector that summarizes long-range global information between segments.

This paper details a generalized scheme to route multiple\nmodular agents on a graph to a predetermined set of target nodes.

In this work, we focus on two representative tasks\nin the category of regular language recognition, known as `even pairs' and\n`parity check', the aim of which is to determine whether the occurrences of\ncertain subsequences in a given sequence are even. Our goal is to explore how a\none-layer transformer, consisting of an attention layer followed by a linear\nlayer, learns to solve these tasks by theoretically analyzing its training\ndynamics under gradient descent. While even pairs can be solved directly by a\none-layer transformer, parity check need to be solved by integrating\nChain-of-Thought (CoT), either into the inference stage of a transformer\nwell-trained for the even pairs task, or into the training of a one-layer\ntransformer. For both problems, our analysis shows that the joint training of\nattention and linear layers exhibits two distinct phases. In the first phase,\nthe attention layer grows rapidly, mapping data sequences into separable\nvectors. In the second phase, the attention layer becomes stable, while the\nlinear layer grows logarithmically and approaches in direction to a max-margin\nhyperplane that correctly separates the attention layer outputs into positive\nand negative samples, and the loss decreases at a rate of $O(1/t)$.
