    "abstract": "Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in\nentertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization,\nvolume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and\ninterpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have\ngained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant\nchallenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and\nhigh pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering.\nOur method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D\nGaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache.\nThis cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to\nchanges in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer\nfunctions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality\nimages without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare\nit against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event\nestimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both\nquantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space\nradiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly\nenhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while\nmaintaining comparable computational efficiency.",

We introduce a new retrieval paradigm: semantic compression, which aims\nto select a compact, representative set of vectors that captures the broader\nsemantic structure around a query. We formalize this objective using principles\nfrom submodular optimization and information geometry, and show that it\ngeneralizes traditional top-k retrieval by prioritizing coverage and diversity.\nTo operationalize this idea, we propose graph-augmented vector retrieval, which\noverlays semantic graphs (e.g., kNN or knowledge-based links) atop vector\nspaces to enable multi-hop, context-aware search. We theoretically analyze the\nlimitations of proximity-based retrieval under high-dimensional concentration\nand highlight how graph structures can improve semantic coverage.

    "abstract": "Geoengineering may offer a way to pause global warming, providing the time\nfor more permanent solutions to become effective. Erection of a high-altitude\nhose offers an affordable and near-term approach to deliver sulfur-bearing\nfluids to the stratosphere in order to perform geoengineering via solar\nradiation management. We discuss the design of a hose extending to an altitude\nof 20 km and sized to deliver 100 ktons of sulfur per year. The sulfur, in the\nform of H$_2$S, is pushed up the hose by a pump on the ground and then sprayed\nout at the top, forming H$_2$SO$_4$ aerosols which scatter enough sunlight to\nperform geoengineering. Because the hose operates continuously, it only has to\ndeliver about 50 gallons/minute (little more than a garden hose). The flux from\na single hose is not sufficient to stop global warming by itself, but is enough\nto test the effect of the aerosols, and, once replicated to about 20 sites\nacross the planet, can offset all the warming caused by atmospheric CO$_2$.\n  Two varieties of hose are presented here, one delivering H$_2$S as a liquid\nand the other as a gas. Pumping liquid H$_2$S through a narrow 20 km hose\nrequires high pressure, which can be handled by strong and lightweight hose\nwalls or by placing intermediate pumps along the hose. The hose is held up by a\nsuite of balloons, either all at its top, or with some placed along its length\nas well. The greatest challenge in suspending such a hose is wind, which if not\ndealt with properly (by streamlining both the balloons and the hose) will\ncollapse the hose. The wide hoses needed to deliver gaseous H$_2$S are\nparticularly susceptible to wind, so must be enclosed within lightweight\naero-shrouds to reduce wind forces.\n  After treating the design of these two hoses, we lay out the steps needed to\ndevelop and fabricate them, and conclude with some thoughts on how the hoses\nmight be fielded.",

While traditional approaches predominantly model\nquery rewrites as isolated pairs, they often fail to capture the sequential and\ntransitional dynamics inherent in real-world user behavior. In this work, we\npropose a novel framework that explicitly models transitional\nqueries--intermediate reformulations occurring during the user's journey toward\ntheir final purchase intent. By mining structured query trajectories from\neBay's large-scale user interaction logs, we reconstruct query sequences that\nreflect shifts in intent while preserving semantic coherence. This approach\nallows us to model a user's shopping funnel, where mid-journey transitions\nreflect exploratory behavior and intent refinement. Furthermore, we incorporate\ngenerative Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce semantically diverse and\nintent-preserving alternative queries, extending beyond what can be derived\nthrough collaborative filtering alone. These reformulations can be leveraged to\npopulate Related Searches or to power intent-clustered carousels on the search\nresults page, enhancing both discovery and engagement.

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission\ndependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle\ncooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach.\nFirst, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm,\nnamely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline\nfor one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double\nDeep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and\nmulti-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment\ntime and improving adaptability over baseline methods.

We assume that PrEP usage is associated with regular\nvisits to a sexual health provider, and thus is correlated with syphilis\ndetection and treatment rates. We examine how PrEP usage can affect community\nstructure in the sexual networks fitted to the NEST data. We identify two types\nof PrEP users, those belonging to a large, highly connected community and\ntending to have a large number of sexual partners, versus those with a small\nnumber of sexual partners and belonging to smaller communities.

    "abstract": "We present an overview of the MINERVA survey, a 259.8 hour (prime) and 127\nhour (parallel) Cycle 4 treasury program on the James Webb Space Telescope\n(JWST). MINERVA is obtaining 8 filter NIRCam medium band imaging (F140M, F162M,\nF182M, F210M, F250M, F300M, F360M, F460M) and 2 filter MIRI imaging (F1280W,\nF1500W) in four of the five CANDELS Extragalactic fields: UDS, COSMOS, AEGIS\nand GOODS-N. These fields were previously observed in Cycle 1 with 7 - 9 NIRCam\nfilters by the PRIMER, CEERS and JADES programs. MINERVA reaches a 5$\\sigma$\ndepth of 28.1 mag in F300M and covers $\\sim$ 542 arcmin$^2$, increasing the\narea of existing JWST medium-band coverage in at least 8 bands by $\\sim$\n7$\\times$. The MIRI imaging reaches a 5$\\sigma$ depth of 23.9 mag in F1280W and\ncovers $\\sim$ 275 arcmin$^2$ in at least 2 MIRI filters. When combined with\nexisting imaging, these data will provide a photometric catalog with 20-26 JWST\nfilters (depending on field) and 26-35 filters total, including HST. This paper\npresents a detailed breakdown of the filter coverage, exposure times, and field\nlayout relative to previous observations, as well as an overview of the primary\nscience goals of the project. These include uncovering the physics of enigmatic\nsources hiding in current broadband catalogs, improving systematics on stellar\nmass functions and number densities by factors of $\\gtrsim$ 3, and resolved\nmapping of stellar mass and star formation at 1 $< z <$ 6. When complete,\nMINERVA will become an integral part of the treasury deep field imaging\ndatasets, significantly improving population studies with well-understood\ncompleteness, robust photometric redshifts, stellar masses, and sizes, and\nfacilitating spectroscopic follow up for decades to come.",

Although many detection models have been developed\nand several datasets have been released to reliably identify synthetic content,\none crucial aspect has been largely overlooked: these models and training\ndatasets can be biased, leading to failures in detection for certain\ndemographic groups and raising significant social, legal, and ethical issues.\nIn this work, we introduce an evaluation framework to contribute to the\nanalysis of bias of synthetic face detectors with respect to several facial\nattributes. This framework exploits synthetic data generation, with evenly\ndistributed attribute labels, for mitigating any skew in the data that could\notherwise influence the outcomes of bias analysis. We build on the proposed\nframework to provide an extensive case study of the bias level of five\nstate-of-the-art detectors in synthetic datasets with 25 controlled facial\nattributes. While the results confirm that, in general, synthetic face\ndetectors are biased towards the presence/absence of specific facial\nattributes, our study also sheds light on the origins of the observed bias\nthrough the analysis of the correlations with the balancing of facial\nattributes in the training sets of the detectors, and the analysis of detectors\nactivation maps in image pairs with controlled attribute modifications.",

    "abstract": "Two-body gravitational interactions will occasionally lead to a stellar-mass\ncompact object entering a very highly eccentric orbit around a massive black\nhole at the center of a galaxy. Gravitational radiation damping will\nsubsequently result in an extreme mass ratio inspiral. Much of the inspiral\ntime of these events is spent with the compact object on a long-period orbit,\nwith a brief burst of gravitational wave emission at periapsis firmly in the\nmHz band. Burst orbits have been previously modeled as parabolic, with a focus\non extreme examples that could be detectable by space-based gravitational wave\ndetectors. This work focuses on the recurring bursts called \"peeps\". Peeps are\nnot likely to be individually resolvable; however, it is also important to\nconsider them as possible sources of signal confusion noise because they do\ngenerate a signal within the LISA band with every pericenter passage. To\naccount for peeps, we must utilize estimates for EMRI capture parameters along\nwith tracking the massive black hole population out to a redshift of 3 using\nthe Illustris Project. Then, this population is combined with an EMRI formation\nrate to estimate the number of EMRI events per unit volume for LISA. In this\nstudy, we model three different assumptions for the gravitational wave\nbackground produced by these highly eccentric peeps. We find that with our two\nmost likely backgrounds, the signal may result in a slight rise of the LISA\nnoise floor (SNR $\\sim 0.3-2.4$); however, in the most abundant case, the\nbackground generated by these sources would be detectable on its own and likely\nobscure many potentially detectable sources (SNR $\\sim77$).",

    "abstract": "Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is a critical task with a\nwide range of applications across different domains. However, existing\napproaches often face trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.\nTo address these challenges, we propose 1D-CGS, a lightweight and effective\nhybrid model that integrates the speed of one-dimensional convolutional neural\nnetworks (1D-CNN) with the topological representation power of GraphSAGE for\nefficient node ranking. The model uses a lightweight input representation built\non two straightforward and significant topological features: node degree and\naverage neighbor degree. These features are processed through 1D convolutions\nto extract local patterns, followed by GraphSAGE layers to aggregate\nneighborhood information. We formulate the node ranking task as a regression\nproblem and use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to generate\nground truth influence scores. 1D-CGS is initially trained on synthetic\nnetworks generated by the Barabasi-Albert model and then applied to real world\nnetworks for identifying influential nodes. Experimental evaluations on twelve\nreal world networks demonstrate that 1D-CGS significantly outperforms\ntraditional centrality measures and recent deep learning models in ranking\naccuracy, while operating in very fast runtime. The proposed model achieves an\naverage improvement of 4.73% in Kendall's Tau correlation and 7.67% in Jaccard\nSimilarity over the best performing deep learning baselines. It also achieves\nan average Monotonicity Index (MI) score 0.99 and produces near perfect rank\ndistributions, indicating highly unique and discriminative rankings.\nFurthermore, all experiments confirm that 1D-CGS operates in a highly\nreasonable time, running significantly faster than existing deep learning\nmethods, making it suitable for large scale applications.",

Over the 60-day duration reported here, the\nintegrated pulse profile remained consistently stable, exhibiting a single,\nnarrow peak with with a small precursor component and no evidence of a\npostcursor one. This pulse profile is in sharp contrast to the double-peaked\nmorphology observed during an observing campaign approximately 120 days\npreceding ours. Along with this change in the integrated pulse profile shape,\nwe also measure a slower spin-down rate compared to the end of that preceding\ncampaign. Together, these differences suggest that a mode-switching event\nlikely occurred between the end of that campaign and the start of ours.\nFinally, we derived a phase-connected timing solution from our data, from which\nwe inferred a characteristic age of approximately 2500 years, about 2.5 times\nolder than the most recent published estimate, and a surface dipole magnetic\nfield strength of roughly 1 x 10^14 G, nearly three times weaker.

To address the first goal, we\ncompute the Pitman relative efficiency of the weighted test relative to the\nunweighted test, yielding an interpretable quantification of proxy quality that\ndrives the power of the weighted test. To address the second goal, we propose\ntwo strategies. First, we propose a maximum-likelihood based approach that\nadapts the proxies to the data. Second, we propose an estimator of the Pitman\nefficiency if a \"positive control outcome variable\" is available (as is often\nthe case in single-cell CRISPR screens), which facilitates an adaptive choice\nof whether to use the proxies at all.

From the\nfitted amplitude, we extract a Sachs-like form factor F(t) and define a\nseparable GPD model H_T(x, t) = h(x)F(t), with h(x) modeled as a normalized\nBeta-like profile. This factorized ansatz satisfies the GPD sum rule and\nenables a direct two-dimensional Fourier transform to construct transverse\nspatial distributions q(x,b). We analyze how longitudinal shaping modulates\ntransverse localization, and quantify spatial features using statistical\ndiagnostics including mean radius, skewness, and kurtosis. The framework is\nreproducible, data-driven, and applicable to other transition channels,\nproviding a physically interpretable map from amplitude behavior to spatial\nstructure.",

    "abstract": "In the virtual realm, individuals with photosensitive epilepsy (PSE)\nencounter challenges when using devices, resulting in exposure to unpredictable\nseizure-causing visual stimuli. The current norm for preventing epileptic\nflashes in media is to detect asynchronously when a flash will occur in a\nvideo, then notifying the user. However, there is a lack of a real-time and\ncomputationally efficient solution for dealing with this issue. To address this\nissue and enhance accessibility for photosensitive viewers, FlashGuard, a novel\napproach, was devised to assess the rate of change of colors in frames across\nthe user's screen and appropriately mitigate stimuli, based on perceptually\naligned color space analysis in the CIELAB color space. The detection system is\nbuilt on analyzing differences in color, and the mitigation system works by\nreducing luminance and smoothing color transitions. This study provides novel\ninsight into how intrinsic color properties contribute to perceptual\ndifferences in flashing for PSE individuals, calling for the adoption of\nbroadened WCAG guidelines to better account for risk. These insights and\nimplementations pave the way for stronger protections for individuals with PSE\nfrom dangerous triggers in digital media, both in policy and in software.",

To improve\nmerge accuracy for a wide range of languages, we propose LastMerge, a generic\nstructured merge tool that can be configured through a thin interface that\nsignificantly reduces the effort of supporting structured merge. To understand\nthe impact that generic structured merge might have on merge accuracy and\nperformance, we run an experiment with four structured merge tools: two Java\nspecific tools, jDime and Spork, and their generic counterparts, respectively\nLastMerge and Mergiraf. Using each tool, we replay merge scenarios from a\nsignificant dataset, and collect data on runtime, behavioral divergences, and\nmerge accuracy. Our results show no evidence that generic structured merge\nsignificantly impacts merge accuracy. Although we observe a difference rate of\napproximately 10% between the Java specific tools and their generic\ncounterparts, most of the differences stem from implementation details and\ncould be avoided.

While EVE measures the full-disk\nspectra, the flare spectrum is easily determined as the EVE spectrum minus the\npre-flare spectrum, as long as only one flare event is happening at a time.\nThese EVE flare observations provide EUV variability that have been used to\nstudy flare phases (including the discovery of the EUV Late Phase flare class),\nflare energetics (plasma temperature variations), corona heating (plasma\nabundance changes that support nano-flare heating mechanism), flare dynamics\n(downwelling and upwelling plasma flows during flares from Doppler shifts), and\ncoronal mass ejections (CME) energetics (CME mass and velocity derived from\ncoronal dimming in some EUV lines). We also introduce a new EVE data product\ncalled the EVE Level 4 Lines data product, which provides line profile-fit\nresults for intensity, wavelength shift, and line width for 70 emission\nfeatures. These emission features are from the chromosphere, transition region,\nand corona, and so Doppler measurements of those lines can reveal important\nplasma dynamical behavior during a flare's impulsive phase and gradual phase.\nWith over 10,000 flares detected in the EVE observations, there is still much\nto study and to learn about solar flare physics using EVE solar EUV spectra.",

The supervised fine-tuning of Vision Language Models\n(VLMs) faces significant scale challenges due to the cost of manual or API\nbased annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised\nfine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage\nunlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).\nBeginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ\nPEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with\nunlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled\nsample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on\nself-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated\nmodel for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method\nachieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset\nspanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes\nonly unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised\nmodel. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training\nimproves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled\nsamples can be effectively leveraged to improve performance.",

The theory also provides a solid\nstarting point for calculating glassy dynamics starting from the microscopic\nforces. Network liquids, which interact via long-lived, geometrically\nconstraining interactions, such as covalent bonding, have competing energy\nscales for bond breaking events and for collective particle rearrangement\nevents. In this paper, we show microscopic calculations via the RFOT theory can\npredict how glassy dynamics depends on the degree of bonding, focusing on\nmixtures of network-forming particles with non-bonding impurities as in\nfamiliar window glass. By introducing soft-core nonbonding interactions, we\nshow the viscosity and fragility of the network liquid model can be computed as\na function of composition, temperature, and density or pressure. We find that\nthe fragility in the strong-bond limit depends only on composition and not on\nthe bond breaking energy and describes well corresponding measurements in\nsodium or potassium silicates.

However, as System Optimum makes some drivers better off than\nothers, voluntary acceptance seems dubious. To overcome this issue, we propose\na new concept of Wardropian cycles, which, in contrast to previous utopian\nvisions, makes the assignment fair on top of being optimal, which amounts to\nsatisfaction of both Wardrop's principles. Such cycles, represented as\nsequences of permutations to the daily assignment matrices, always exist and\nequalise, after a limited number of days, average travel times among travellers\n(like in User Equilibrium) while preserving everyday optimality of path flows\n(like in System Optimum). We propose exact methods to compute such cycles and\nreduce their length and within-cycle inconvenience to the users. As\nidentification of optimal cycles turns out to be NP-hard in many aspects, we\nintroduce a greedy heuristic efficiently approximating the optimal solution.\nFinally, we introduce and discuss a new paradigm of Cyclical User Equilibrium,\nwhich ensures stability of optimal Wardropian Cycles under unilateral\ndeviations.\n  We complement our theoretical study with large-scale simulations. In\nBarcelona, 670 vehicle-hours of Price-of-Anarchy are eliminated using cycles\nwith a median length of 11 days-though 5% of cycles exceed 90 days. However, in\nBerlin, just five days of applying the greedy assignment rule significantly\nreduces initial inequity.

The resulting dispersion relation, group velocity, and\nrelaxation rate exhibit striking signatures, such as curve crossing, level\nrepulsion, turnover, bifurcation, and coalescence, as the decay rate crosses\nthe critical transition or the wavevector crosses the resonance. The spectral\ncharacterization leads to surprising features in the non-Hermitian wave packet\ndynamics: (i) maximal population relaxation rate at the critical transition;\n(ii) reversed propagation in the center-of-mass motion; (iii)\nballistic-to-diffusion transition; (iv) contraction in the displacement and\nwidth of the polariton wave-packet.

Although\nstructured data intended for analysis and publication is often well managed,\nmuch of a group's collective knowledge remains informal, fragmented, or\nundocumented--often passed down orally through meetings, mentoring, and\nday-to-day collaboration. This includes private resources such as emails,\nmeeting notes, training materials, and ad hoc documentation. Together, these\nreflect the group's tacit knowledge--the informal, experience-based expertise\nthat underlies much of their work.

Retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) systems offer promising solutions by enabling users to query\nand generate responses grounded in relevant source material. However, most\ncurrent RAG-LLM systems are oriented toward public documents and overlook the\nprivacy concerns of internal research materials.

This study presents a systematic comparison using\nconstrained multi-objective optimization with the integrated FUsion Synthesis\nEngine (FUSE) framework. Over 200,000 integrated design evaluations were\nperformed exploring the trade-offs between capital cost minimization and\noperational reliability (maximizing $q_{95}$) while satisfying engineering\nconstraints including 250 $\\pm$ 50 MW net electric power, tritium breeding\nratio $>$1.1, power exhaust limits and an hour flattop time. Both\nconfigurations achieve similar cost-performance Pareto fronts through\ncontrasting design philosophies. PT, while demonstrating resilience to pedestal\ndegradation (compensating for up to 40% reduction), are constrained to larger\nmachines ($R_0$ $>$ 6.5 m) by the narrow operational window between L-H\nthreshold requirements and the research-established power exhaust limit\n($P_{sol}/R$ $<$ 15 MW/m). This forces optimization through comparatively\nreduced magnetic field ($\\sim$8T). NT configurations exploit their freedom from\nthese constraints to access compact, high-field designs ($R_0 \\sim 5.5$ m,\n$B_0$ $>$ 12 T), creating natural synergy with advancing HTS technology.\nSensitivity analyses reveal that PT's economic viability depends critically on\nuncertainties in L-H threshold scaling and power handling limits. Notably, a\n50% variation in either could eliminate viable designs or enable access to the\ncompact design space. These results suggest configuration selection should be\nrisk-informed: PT offers the lowest-cost path when operational constraints can\nbe confidently predicted, while NT is robust to large variations in constraints\nand physics uncertainties.",

    "abstract": "Solder joint reliability related to failures due to thermomechanical loading\nis a critically important yet physically complex engineering problem. As a\nresult, simulated behavior is oftentimes computationally expensive. In an\nincreasingly data-driven world, the usage of efficient data-driven design\nschemes is a popular choice. Among them, Bayesian optimization (BO) with\nGaussian process regression is one of the most important representatives. The\nauthors argue that computational savings can be obtained from exploiting\nthorough surrogate modeling and selecting a design candidate based on multiple\nacquisition functions. This is feasible due to the relatively low computational\ncost, compared to the expensive simulation objective. This paper addresses the\nshortcomings in the adjacent literature by providing and implementing a novel\nheuristic framework to perform BO with adaptive hyperparameters across the\nvarious optimization iterations. Adaptive BO is subsequently compared to\nregular BO when faced with synthetic objective minimization problems. The\nresults show the efficiency of adaptive BO when compared any worst-performing\nregular Bayesian schemes. As an engineering use case, the solder joint\nreliability problem is tackled by minimizing the accumulated non-linear creep\nstrain under a cyclic thermal load. Results show that adaptive BO outperforms\nregular BO by 3% on average at any given computational budget threshold,\ncritically saving half of the computational expense budget. This practical\nresult underlines the methodological potential of the adaptive Bayesian\ndata-driven methodology to achieve better results and cut optimization-related\nexpenses. Lastly, in order to promote the reproducibility of the results, the\ndata-driven implementations are made available on an open-source basis.",

Given dynamic nature of\nthe spectrum environment, ability to quickly switch between hypotheses is\nessential for maintaining low-latency, high-throughput operation.

By\npreloading kernels that are not simultaneously active into same IMEM, our tool\nenables low-latency reconfiguration without runtime conflicts.

This shift\nbreaks key classical Internet design principles, such as the end-to-end\nargument, due to the inherently stateful and non-local nature of entangled\nstates that require coordinated in-network operations. Consequently, in this\npaper we propose a novel hierarchical Quantum Internet architecture centered\naround the concept of entanglement-defined controller, enabling scalable and\nefficient management of the aforementioned in-network operations. However,\narchitecture alone is insufficient for network scalability, which requires a\nquantum-native control plane that fundamentally rethinks addressing and\nrouting. Consequently, we propose a quantum addressing scheme that embraces the\nprinciples and quantum phenomena within the node identifiers. Built upon this\naddressing scheme, we also design a quantum-native routing protocol that\nexhibits scalable and compact routing tables, by efficiently operating over\nentanglement-aware topologies. Finally, we design a quantum address splitting\nfunctionality based on Schr\\\"odinger's oracles that generalizes classical\nmatch-and-forward logic to the quantum domain. Together, these contributions\ndemonstrate, for the first time, the key advantages of quantum-by-design\nnetwork functioning.",

Previous work has clearly demonstrated the benefits of exploiting\nequi-sparsity in the presence of ``rare features'' (Yan and Bien 2021). In this\nwork, we propose a new tree-guided regularization scheme for simultaneous\nestimation and feature aggregation.

The resulting morphological\ntypes were linked to mobility patterns through descriptive statistics, marginal\neffects estimation, and post hoc statistical testing.

To address this\nissue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a\nnovel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data\ncollection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a\nregularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant\nfeatures identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects\nof confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and\nthe Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and\napplying our method in both domains. Experimental results show that the\nimprovement of GABRIL over behavior cloning is around 179% more than the same\nnumber for other baselines in the Atari and 76% in the CARLA setup.

To address these limitations, we\npropose a reward-augmented learning framework for AP (RARLAP), that mitigates\nthe inherent complexities of continuous-domain control by leveraging structured\nreward design to induce smooth and adaptable policy behavior, trained entirely\nwithin a high-fidelity Unity-based custom 3D simulation environment. We\nsystematically design and assess three structured reward strategies: goal-only\nreward (GOR), dense proximity reward (DPR), and milestone-augmented reward\n(MAR), each integrated with both on-policy and off-policy optimization\nparadigms. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the on-policy MAR achieves a\n91\\% success rate, yielding smoother trajectories and more robust behavior,\nwhile GOR and DPR fail to guide effective learning. Convergence and trajectory\nanalyses demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances policy adaptability,\naccelerates training, and improves safety in continuous control. Overall,\nRARLAP establishes that reward augmentation effectively addresses complex\nautonomous parking challenges, enabling scalable and efficient policy\noptimization with both on- and off-policy methods.

This study evaluated muscle\nsynergies and coactivation patterns as indicators of neuromuscular coordination\nin lower-limb across three power levels of cycling. Twenty recreational\ncyclists performed a graded cycling test on a stationary bicycle ergometer.\nElectromyography was recorded bilaterally from seven lower-limb muscles and\nmuscle synergies were extracted using non-negative matrix factorization. The\nCoactivation Index (CI), Synergy Index (SI), and Synergy Coordination Index\n(SCI) were calculated to assess muscle coordination patterns. Four muscle\nsynergies were identified consistently across power levels, with changes in\nsynergy composition and activation timing correlated with increased muscular\ndemands. As power level increased, the CI showed reduced muscle coactivation at\nthe knee and greater muscle coactivation at the ankle. The SI revealed a\ngreater contribution of the synergy weights of the extensor muscles than those\nof the flexor muscles at the knee. In contrast, the relative EMG contribution\nof hip extensor and flexor muscles remained consistent with increasing power\nlevels. The SCI increased significantly with increasing power level, suggesting\na reduction in the size of the synergy space and improved neuromuscular\ncoordination. These findings provide insight into how the central nervous\nsystem modulates its response to increasing mechanical demands. Combining\nsynergy and coactivation indices offers a promising approach to assess motor\ncontrol, inform rehabilitation, and optimize performance in cycling tasks.",

    "abstract": "This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of\ndomination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human\nsystems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate\narbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a\nproperty enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate\neffectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand\nde Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this\nprinciple beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,\nparticularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation\n-> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions\nas a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective\ncontestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like\n\"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the\nwolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their\nrationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while\nappearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from\naccountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes\narbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern\ntheory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as\ncare, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily\ndeveloped through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new\npathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence\nsystems.",

The system delivers\nseveral building blocks: a framework for planning and optimizing agentic AI\nexecution graphs using cost models that account for compute, memory, and\nbandwidth constraints of different HW; a MLIR based representation and\ncompilation system that can decompose AI agent execution graphs into granular\noperators and generate code for different HW options; and a dynamic\norchestration system that can place the granular components across a\nheterogeneous compute infrastructure and stitch them together while meeting an\nend-to-end SLA.

In a distributed control architecture,\nscalability is ensured by designing a small number of distinguished\ncontrollers, significantly fewer than the number of agents, even when agent\ndiversity is high. Our findings indicate that the number of controllers\nrequired can be effectively determined by the number of strongly connected\ncomponents of the underlying graph. The study in this paper builds on the\nrecently developed phase theory of matrices and systems. First, we employ the\nconcept of matrix phase, specifically the phase alignability of a collection of\nmatrices, to quantify agent diversity. Next, we use matrix phase, particularly\nthe essential phase of the graph Laplacian, to evaluate the interaction quality\namong the agents. Based on these insights, we derive a sufficient condition for\nthe solvability of the synchronization problem, framed as a trade-off between\nthe agent diversity and the interaction quality. In the process, a controller\ndesign procedure based on Lyapunov analysis is provided, which produces low\ngain, component-wise synchronizing controllers when the solvability condition\nis satisfied. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed design procedure. Furthermore, we consider cases where the\ncomponent-wise controller design problem is unsolvable. We propose alternative\nstrategies involving the design of a small inventory of controllers, which can\nstill achieve synchronization effectively by employing certain clustering\nmethods to manage heterogeneity.",

In the standard (non-quantitative) setting,\nnarrowing has been successfully applied in various domains, including\nfunctional logic programming, theorem proving, and equational unification.\nHere, we focus on quantitative narrowing to solve unification problems in\nquantitative equational theories over Lawverean quantales.

Specifically, PCI relies on two\ntypes of proxies: a treatment-inducing confounding proxy, related to the\noutcome only through its association with unmeasured confounders (given\ntreatment and covariates), and an outcome-inducing confounding proxy, related\nto the treatment only through such association (given covariates). These\nproxies must satisfy stringent exclusion restrictions - namely, the treatment\nproxy must not affect the outcome, and the outcome proxy must not be affected\nby the treatment. To improve identification and potentially efficiency,\nmultiple proxies are often used, raising concerns about bias from exclusion\nviolations. To address this, we introduce necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor identifying causal effects in the presence of many proxies, some\npotentially invalid. Under a canonical proximal linear structural equations\nmodel, we propose a LASSO-based median estimator that jointly selects valid\nproxies and estimates the causal effect, with theoretical guarantees.\nRecognizing LASSO's limitations in consistently selecting valid treatment\nproxies, we develop an adaptive LASSO-based estimator with differential\npenalization. We show that it is root-n consistent and yields valid confidence\nintervals when a valid outcome proxy is available. We also extend the approach\nto settings with many potentially invalid outcome proxies.

In order to have realistic mathematical models, one needs to take\ninto account that the environmental fluctuations are inherently stochastic.\nOften, environmental stochasticity is modeled by systems of stochastic\ndifferential equations. However, this type of stochasticity is not always the\nbest suited for ecological modeling. Instead, biological systems can be modeled\nusing piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMP). For a PDMP the process\nfollows the flow of a system of ordinary differential equations for a random\ntime, after which the environment switches to a different state, where the\ndynamics is given by a different system of differential equations. Then this is\nrepeated. The current paper is devoted to the study of the dynamics of $n$\npopulations described by $n$-dimensional Kolmogorov PDMP. We provide sharp\nconditions for persistence and extinction, based on the invasion rates\n(Lyapunov exponents) of the ergodic probability measures supported on the\nboundary of the positive orthant. In order to showcase the applicability of our\nresults, we apply the theory in some interesting ecological examples.",

    "abstract": "Numerous core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) exhibit signatures of interaction\nwith circumstellar material (CSM). Bright radio emission years after the SN is\none such indication of dense CSM at large distances from the star, which may be\ngenerated via binary interactions. In this work, we use forward modeling to\nstudy the radio emission produced by interaction between the SN ejecta and CSM\nformed by non-conservative stable mass transfer from stripped-envelope stars in\nshort-period binaries. The donors are among the likely progenitors of\nhydrogen-poor CCSNe that significantly expand $10^3$-$10^4$ years before\ncore-collapse. We identify that non-conservative stable mass transfer from\nlower-mass stripped stars can create a detached shell-like CSM, whereas for our\nhigher-mass stars the CSM is wind-like. In our models, mass transfer rates of\n$\\sim 10^{-4} M_\\odot$ $\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ lead to dense CSM extending to $\\sim\n10^{18}$ $\\mathrm{cm}$. The predicted radio emission is luminous at late times,\nreaching $L_{\\nu}\\sim10^{26}$-$10^{29}$ $\\mathrm{erg}$ $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ at years to decades after core-collapse, which is as bright\nas late-time radio emission observed for a sample of hydrogen-poor SNe.\nHowever, the light curves of events with early-time data show more complex\nbehavior in the weeks to months after core-collapse. We qualitatively\ndemonstrate that similar early-time emission can manifest for CSM that is\naccelerated to speeds of $\\sim10^3$ $\\mathrm{km}$ $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ upon\nejection, as well as for different viewing angles in case of an asymmetric CSM\ndistribution.",

In\nthis paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by\nintroducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for\ninput and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users\nto interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose\nSTOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates\narbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames\nwithin a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric\nvideo instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require\nreasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other\nexisting benchmarks across video question answering and referring object\nsegmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed\nmodel consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and\nsegmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video\nand image understanding.

To overcome these limitations, researchers\nhave proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,\nsubjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory\nextends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective\nperceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which\nagents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available\nactions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of\nhypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted\nto dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from\ncybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general\ngame-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory\nand its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop\nagent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to\nassess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals\nprevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based\nmodels in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical\nframeworks in practical applications.

A\nTransformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism captures long-range contextual\nrelationships within the spatial domain, further enhanced by multi-scale\nfeature utilization for refined local details, leading to accurate prediction.\nMorphological boundary refinement is then employed to address indistinct\nboundaries with neighboring organs, capturing finer details and yielding\nprecise boundary labels. The efficacy of T-MPEDNet is comprehensively assessed\non two widely utilized public benchmark datasets, LiTS and 3DIRCADb. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the superiority of T-MPEDNet\ncompared to twelve state-of-the-art methods.

The brightness ($\\Delta m_g = -6.12$) of this flare, combined with\nthe high air mass ($1.45 \\lesssim X \\lesssim 1.75$) and blue filter (DES $g$,\n398-548 nm) in which it was observed, provided ideal conditions to measure the\nzenith-ward apparent motion of the source due to differential chromatic\nrefraction (DCR) and, from that, infer the effective temperature of the event.\nWe model the flare's spectral energy distribution as a blackbody to produce the\nconstraints on flare temperature and geometric properties derived from\nsingle-band photometry. We additionally demonstrate how simplistic assumptions\non the flaring spectrum, as well as on the evolution of flare geometry, can\nresult in solutions that overestimate effective temperature. Exploiting DCR\nenables studying chromatic phenomena with ground-based astrophysical surveys\nand stellar flares on M-dwarfs are a particularly enticing target for such\nstudies due to their ubiquity across the sky, and the heightened color contrast\nbetween their red quiescent photospheres and the blue flare emission.

    "abstract": "The quest to find the first stars has driven astronomers across cosmic time,\nfrom hopes to identify their signatures in their heyday at cosmic dawn to deep\nsearches for their remnants in our local neighborhood. Such work crucially\nrelies on robust theoretical modelling to understand when and where we expect\npristine star formation to have occurred and survived. To that end, here we\nintroduce an analytic bathtub for cosmic dawn, the abcd model, to efficiently\ntrace the formation of the first stars from their birth through the first\nbillion years of our universe's history, jointly following star formation out\nof pristine and metal-enriched gas over time. Informed by the latest\ntheoretical developments in our understanding of star formation in molecular\ncooling halos, metal mixing, and early galaxies, we expand pre-existing minimal\nmodels for galaxy formation to include Population III stars and many of the\nprocesses - both internal and environmental - affecting their evolution, while\nremaining fast and interpretable. With this framework, we can bridge the gap\nbetween numerical simulations and previous semi-analytic models, as we\nself-consistently follow star formation in dark matter halos from the minihalo\nera through the epoch of reionization, finding that, under plausible physical\nconditions, pristine star formation can persist at a high level in the presence\nof Pop II star formation down to $z\\sim 5$, but is limited to the most massive\nhalos. We highlight areas of theoretical uncertainty in the physics\nunderpinning Pop III star formation and demonstrate the effects of this\nuncertainty first on individual star formation histories and subsequently\nbracketing the range of global star formation levels we expect. Finally, we\nleverage this model to make preliminary observable predictions, generating\nforecasts for high-$z$ luminosity functions, transient rates, and the 21-cm\nglobal signal.",

Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head\navatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as\nan inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the\nhuman head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and\nhair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such\nholistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle\nswapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of\nface and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this\napproach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair\nfrom studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture\nderived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and\nhairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,\nincorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective\nseparation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of\nface and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot\nmanner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D\nhead avatars for unseen subjects.

Previous challenges in constraining $f_\\mathrm{e}$ over\nlarge areas stemmed from the limitations of observational tracers and chemical\nmodels. Recent models have identified molecular line ratios that can trace\n$f_\\mathrm{e}$ in different environments within molecular clouds. In this\nstudy, we analyze various molecular lines in the 3-4 mm range to derive the\nionization fraction across the Orion B giant molecular cloud. We focus on dense\nand translucent gas, exploring variations with gas density ($n$) and the\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field ($G_0$). Our findings show that the\nionization fraction ranges from $10^{-5.5}$ to $10^{-4}$ in translucent gas and\n$10^{-8}$ to $10^{-6}$ in dense gas. Notably, $f_\\mathrm{e}$ is sensitive to\n$G_0$ in dense, UV-illuminated regions, decreasing with increasing volume\ndensity ($f_\\mathrm{e} \\propto n^{-0.227}$ for dense and $f_\\mathrm{e} \\propto\nn^{-0.3}$ for translucent gas) and increasing with $G_0$. In translucent gas,\ndiffering line ratios yield consistent fe values, indicating the importance of\nelectron excitation of HCN and HNC. For dense gas, we recommend using the\nCN(1-0)/N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) ratio for upper limits on fe and\nC$^{18}$O(1-0)/HCO$^+$(1-0) for lower limits. In translucent environments,\nCCH(1-0)/HNC(1-0) effectively traces $f_\\mathrm{e}$. The higher fe values in\ntranslucent gas align with the C$^+$/CI/CO transition, while values in dense\ngas are adequate for coupling with the magnetic field.",

    "abstract": "We introduce MMBench-GUI, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI\nautomation agents across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web\nplatforms. It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element\nGrounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills\nfor GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA)\nmetric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios.\nThrough MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical\ndeterminant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of\nmodular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore,\nto achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and\ncross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad\naction space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important,\ntask efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models\nsuffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even\nwhen tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization,\neffective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable\ntruly efficient and scalable GUI automation. Our benchmark code, evaluation\ndata, and running environment will be publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/open-compass/MMBench-GUI.",

    "abstract": "Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast\ndoubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved\nevaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching\nsuperforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been\nreported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success\nof recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that\ntechnology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been\ndeveloped. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling\ndatasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how\nthese technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to\nsociety in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths\nand considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology,\naiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.",

    "abstract": "The contrast transfer function (CTF) is widely used to evaluate phase\nretrieval methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM),\nincluding center-of-mass imaging, parallax imaging, direct ptychography, and\niterative ptychography. However, the CTF reflects only the maximum usable\nsignal, neglecting the effects of finite electron fluence and the\nPoisson-limited nature of detection. As a result, it can significantly\noverestimate practical performance, especially in low-dose regimes. Here, we\nemploy the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR), as a dose-aware statistical\nframework to evaluate the recoverable signal as a function of spatial\nfrequency. Using numerical reconstructions of white-noise objects, we show that\ncenter-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent\nSSNRs, with close-form analytic expressions. In contrast, iterative\nptychography exhibits a surprising dose dependence: at low fluence, its SSNR\nconverges to that of direct ptychography; at high fluence, it saturates at a\nvalue consistent with the maximum detective quantum efficiency predicted by\nrecent quantum Fisher information bounds. The results highlight the limitations\nof CTF-based evaluation and motivate SSNR as a more accurate, dose-aware metric\nfor assessing STEM phase retrieval methods.",

Recent\nmicrolensing surveys have discovered several free-floating planets that are not\nbound to any known stellar systems. Additionally, three interstellar objects,\nnamely 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/ATLAS, have been detected passing\nthrough our solar system on hyperbolic trajectories. In this work, we search\nfor FFOs on hyperbolic orbits that pass near millisecond pulsars (MSPs), where\ntheir gravitational influence can induce detectable perturbations in pulse\narrival times. Using the NANOGrav 15-year narrowband dataset, which contains\nhigh-precision timing data for 68 MSPs, we conduct a search for such hyperbolic\nscattering events between FFOs and pulsars. Although no statistically\nsignificant events were detected, this non-detection enables us to place upper\nlimits on the number density of FFOs as a function of their mass within our\nlocal region of the Galaxy. For example, the upper limit on the number density\nfor Jupiter-mass FFOs ($\\sim 10^{-2.5} - 10^{-3.5}~M_{\\odot}$) obtained from\ndifferent pulsars ranges from $5.25\\times10^{6}~\\text{pc}^{-3}$ to\n$5.37\\times10^{9}~\\text{pc}^{-3}$, while the upper limit calculated by\ncombining results from all the pulsars is $6.03\\times10^{5}~\\text{pc}^{-3}$.\nThese results represent the first constraints on FFO population derived from\npulsar timing data.",

    "abstract": "Many sequential recommender systems suffer from the cold start problem, where\nitems with few or no interactions cannot be effectively used by the model due\nto the absence of a trained embedding. Content-based approaches, which leverage\nitem metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use\nembeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as\ninitialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content\nembeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt\nto the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can\ndegrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far\nfrom their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to\naddress this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or\nfine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen\nembeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting\nthem go too far from their original semantic structure. This approach\ndemonstrates consistent improvements across multiple datasets and modalities,\nincluding e-commerce datasets with textual descriptions and a music dataset\nwith audio-based representation.",

With the combined power of JWST and ALMA, it is now possible\nto use high resolution imaging in rest-optical, rest near-infrared (NIR), and\nrest-submm wavelengths to study the multi-wavelength morphologies tracing both\nthe stellar populations and dust within this key phase. We present the joint\nanalysis of JWST/NIRCam imaging in GOODS-S and mm dust emission traced by ALMA\nfor a sample of 33 galaxies at $z$=1.5 to $z$=5.5 selected from the 1.1mm\nGOODS-ALMA 2.0 survey, and compare the morphologies of this population to mass\nand redshift selected samples of field star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The\n1.1mm-selected sample are morphologically distinct from other similarly massive\nstar-forming galaxies; we find a steeper size-wavelength gradient from\n1.5-4.4$\\mu$m, with a more dramatic decrease in size towards longer\nwavelengths. While the rest-NIR surface brightness profiles of the\n1.1mm-selected galaxies are brighter in the inner regions relative to the field\nstar-forming population, they are remarkably similar to the quiescent\npopulation. These morphological differences could suggest that dusty\nstar-forming galaxies, unlike more typical star-forming galaxies, have already\nbuilt up stellar mass in a severely dust-obscured core, leading to extended and\nclumpy morphologies at rest-optical wavelengths and more compact emission in\nthe rest-NIR that is co-spatial with dust. If the bulge is already established,\nwe speculate that mm-selected galaxies may imminently evolve to join their\nquiescent descendants.",

Here, we investigate the non-Hermitian Hubbard model with\nasymmetric hopping, employing real-space dynamical mean-field theory (R-DMFT),\na novel extension to such non-Hermitian correlated models-to capture both local\ncorrelations and spatial inhomogeneities. By analyzing the end-to-end Green's\nfunction as probes of directional amplification, we demonstrate that strong\ncorrelations can suppress the skin effect, leading to a crossover from\nboundary-dominated to correlation-driven dynamics. Our systematic study reveals\nthat correlations dominate at small to intermediate strength of asymmetric\nhopping, inducing exponential decay in the end-to-end Green's function, but\nhigher strength of asymmetric hopping can restore amplification even at strong\ninteraction. These results illuminate the tunable interplay between\ncorrelations and non-Hermitian physics, suggesting avenues for engineering\nnon-reciprocal transport in correlated open quantum systems.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing images in low-light conditions is an important challenge in\ncomputer vision. Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of\nimages, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This\npaper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive\ngamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of\nthe low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive\ngamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively\nat different illumination levels suitable for the image without human\nintervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative\nevaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved\nlow-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color\ndistribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a\nmore efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple\napplications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical\nimages, and photography in low-light environments.",

Traditional\nimage-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they\nrely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high\nframe rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera\nparameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,\nmaking the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing\nby using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with\nsubmillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the\npresence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions\nappear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal\nrepresentation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses\non events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded\nand use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our\nmethod on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that\noverlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,\nresulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our\napproach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for\nimage reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision\nalgorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth\nestimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\\%$ performance improvement over\nother de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing\nthe reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions,\npaving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.",

For our main result, we begin with an initial\nallocation that satisfies envy-freeness up to one chore (EF1) and\nPareto-optimality (PO); the existence of such an allocation was recently\nestablished in a major breakthrough by Mahara (2025). We further demonstrate\nthe strength and generality of our framework by giving simple and unified\nproofs of existing results, namely (i) $2$-EFX for bivalued instances, (ii)\n2-EFX for three agents, (iii) EFX when the number of chores is at most twice\nthe number of agents, and (iv) $4$-EFX for all instances.

    "abstract": "As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in sensitive application\nareas, the demand for interpretable and trustworthy decision-making has\nincreased. Random Forests (RF), despite their widespread use and strong\nperformance on tabular data, remain difficult to interpret due to their\nensemble nature. We present Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC), a model-specific\nexplainability method that reveals both local and global structure in RFs by\ngrouping instances according to shared decision paths. FGC produces\nhuman-interpretable clusters aligned with the model's internal logic and\ncomputes cluster-specific and global feature importance scores to derive\ndecision rules underlying RF predictions. FGC accurately recovered latent\nsubclass structure on a benchmark dataset and outperformed classical clustering\nand post-hoc explanation methods. Applied to an AML transcriptomic dataset, FGC\nuncovered biologically coherent subpopulations, disentangled disease-relevant\nsignals from confounders, and recovered known and novel gene expression\npatterns. FGC bridges the gap between performance and interpretability by\nproviding structure-aware insights that go beyond feature-level attribution.",

    "abstract": "Masking information into quantum correlations is a cornerstone of many\nquantum information applications. While there exist the no-hiding and\nno-masking theorems, approximate quantum information masking (AQIM) offers a\npromising means of circumventing the constraints. Despite its potential, AQIM\nstill remains underexplored, and constructing explicit approximate maskers\nremains a challenge. In this work, we investigate AQIM from multiple\nperspectives and propose using random isometries to construct approximate\nmaskers. First, different notions of AQIM are introduced and we find there are\nprofound intrinsic connections among them. These relationships are\ncharacterized by a set of figures of merit, which are introduced to quantify\nthe deviation of AQIM from exact QIM. We then explore the possibility of\nrealizing AQIM via random isometries in bipartite and multipartite systems. In\nbipartite systems, we identify a fundamental lower bound for a key figure of\nmerit, implying that almost all random isometries fail to realize AQIM. This\nsurprising result generalizes the original no-masking theorem to the\nno-random-AQIM theorem for bipartite systems. In contrast, in multipartite\nsystems, we show almost all random isometries can realize AQIM. Remarkably, the\nnumber of physical qubits required to randomly mask a single logical qubit\nscales only linearly. We further explore the implications of these findings. In\nparticular, we show that, under certain conditions, approximate quantum error\ncorrection is equivalent to AQIM. Consequently, AQIM naturally gives rise to\napproximate quantum error correction codes with constant code rates and\nexponentially small correction inaccuracies. Overall, our results establish\nquantum information masking as a central concept in quantum information theory,\nbridging diverse notions across multiple domains.",

    "abstract": "Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric\npriors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly\nrely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and\nprevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for\nauto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only\nframework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy\nreconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic\nscene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing\nvision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from\nincomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To\novercome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation\nusing an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and\nscalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,\nand dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is\nexplicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly\nimproving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled\nto better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on\nthe Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry\nreconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from\ndiverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy\nmodels on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.\nIt highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy\nreconstruction as a new paradigm for scalable auto-labeling.

    "abstract": "In order to derive model-independent observational bounds on dark\nenergy/modified gravity theories, a typical approach is to constrain\nparametrised models intended to capture the space of dark energy theories. Here\nwe investigate in detail the effect that the nature of these parametrisations\ncan have, finding significant effects on the resulting cosmological dark energy\nconstraints. In order to observationally distinguish well-motivated and\nphysical parametrisations from unphysical ones, it is crucial to understand the\ntheoretical priors that physical parametrisations place on the phenomenology of\ndark energy. To this end we discuss a range of theoretical priors that can be\nimposed on general dark energy parametrisations, and their effect on the\nconstraints on the phenomenology of dynamical dark energy. More specifically,\nwe investigate both the phenomenological $\\{\\mu,\\Sigma\\}$ parametrisation as\nwell as effective field theory (EFT) inspired approaches to model dark energy\ninteractions. We compare the constraints obtained in both approaches for\ndifferent phenomenological and theory-informed time-dependences for the\nunderlying functional degrees of freedom, discuss the effects of priors derived\nfrom gravitational wave physics, and investigate the interplay between\nconstraints on parameters constraining only the background evolution vs.\nparameters controlling linear perturbations.",

    "abstract": "The exceptionally low-energy isomeric transition in $^{229}$Th at around\n148.4 nm offers a unique opportunity for coherent nuclear control and the\nrealisation of a nuclear clock. Recent advances, most notably the incorporation\nof large ensembles of $^{229}$Th nuclei in transparent crystals and the\ndevelopment of pulsed vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) lasers, have enabled initial\nlaser spectroscopy of this transition. However, the lack of an intense,\nnarrow-linewidth VUV laser has precluded coherent nuclear manipulation. Here we\nintroduce and demonstrate the first continuous-wave laser at 148.4 nm,\ngenerated via four-wave mixing (FWM) in cadmium vapor. The source delivers 100\nnW of power with a linewidth well below 100 Hz and supports broad wavelength\ntunability. This represents a five-orders-of-magnitude improvement in linewidth\nover all previous single-frequency lasers below 190 nm, marking a major advance\nin laser technology. We develop a spatially resolved homodyne technique to\nplace a stringent upper bound on the phase noise induced by the FWM process and\ndemonstrate sub-hertz linewidth capability. These results eliminate the final\ntechnical hurdle to a $^{229}$Th-based nuclear clock, opening new directions in\nquantum metrology, nuclear quantum optics and precision tests of the Standard\nModel.

In contrast to\nconventional flows that rely on wire-load models, this methodology leverages\nreal backend performance data to guide synthesis parameter tuning, optimization\nsequence selection, and constraint refinement, with the LLM functioning as an\nintelligent design space exploration agent. Experimental evaluation on\nrepresentative digital designs demonstrates 15-30% improvements in timing\nclosure and 10-20% area reduction compared to default synthesis flows,\nestablishing MCP4EDA as the first practical LLM-controlled end-to-end\nopen-source EDA automation system.

We compare the emission of HCN(1-0), HNC(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) with the\nemission of N2H+(1-0) at cloud-scales (125 pc) across the central 5x7 kpc of\nthe Whirlpool galaxy, M51a, from \"Surveying the Whirlpool galaxy at Arcseconds\nwith NOEMA\" (SWAN). We find that the integrated intensities of HCN, HNC and\nHCO+ are more steeply correlated with N2H+ emission compared to the bulk\nmolecular gas tracer CO, and we find variations in this relation across the\ncenter, molecular ring, northern and southern disk of M51. Compared to HCN and\nHNC emission, the HCO+ emission follows the N2H+ emission more similarly across\nthe environments and physical conditions such as surface densities of molecular\ngas, stellar mass, star-formation rate, dynamical equilibrium pressure and\nradius. Under the assumption that N2H+ is a fair tracer of dense gas at these\nscales, this makes HCO+ a more favorable dense gas tracer than HCN within the\ninner disk of M51. In all environments within our field of view, even when\nremoving the central 2 kpc, HCN/CO, commonly used to trace average cloud\ndensity, is only weakly depending on molecular gas mass surface density. While\nratios of other dense gas lines to CO show a steeper dependency on the surface\ndensity of molecular gas, it is still shallow in comparison to other nearby\nstar-forming disk galaxies. The reasons might be physical conditions in M51\nthat are different from other normal star-forming galaxies. Increased\nionization rates, increased dynamical equilibrium pressure in the central few\nkpc and the impact of the dwarf companion galaxy NGC 5195 are proposed\nmechanisms that might enhance HCN and HNC emission over HCO+ and N2H+ emission\nat larger-scale environments and cloud scales.",

These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the\nrobustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from\noutcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are\ntypically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart\nreview of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We\ndescribe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study\nus-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to\nreduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave\nadaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation\nstudy once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient\nprecision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the\nperformance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in\npatients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the\nNLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by\n40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have\nprevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision\nin derived measurement characteristics.

This study presents\na combined approach using Liouville mapping and the field-particle correlation\ntechnique to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the velocity-space\nsignature of ion cyclotron damping. Liouville mapping offers a computationally\nefficient way to predict perturbations to the particle velocity distribution\nfunction using single-particle trajectories in prescribed electromagnetic\nfields. One may apply the field-particle correlation technique to these\nperturbed velocity distributions to reveal the unique velocity-space signatures\nof the secular energy transfer rate associated with specific wave-particle\ninteractions. We validate this method by reproducing known Landau damping\nsignatures for kinetic Alfv\\'en waves, and then we apply this method to ion\ncyclotron waves where ion cyclotron damping dominates. The resulting\nvelocity-space signature reveals distinct energization features of ion\ncyclotron damping : (i) a quadrupolar pattern in the perpendicular $(v_x, v_y)$\nplane; and (ii) a localized energization near the $n = 1$ resonant velocity in\ngyrotropic $(v_\\parallel, v_\\perp)$ velocity-space. The quantitative patterns\nremain unchanged as the ion plasma beta $\\beta_i$ is varied, ultimately showing\nminimal $v_\\perp$ dependence on $\\beta_i$ of the velocity-space signature at\nthe $n = 1$ resonant velocity.

Due to\nthe non-spherical geometry of such bodies, their gravitational potential is\ndisturbed relative to a central field. By considering the body as a polyhedron\nand decomposing it into tetrahedral elements, we use the Series Potential\nExpansion Method (PSEM) to approximate the total potential by summing the\npotentials of each tetrahedron. While this model does not offer higher accuracy\nthan the classical polyhedral approach, it achieves relative errors below 0.1\\%\nfor points outside the body when developed to higher orders (e.g., orders 11\nand 12), and significantly reduces execution time. To validate this approach,\nwe apply our model to asteroids (87) Sylvia, (101955) Bennu, (99942) Apophis,\nand (25143) Itokawa. We determine equilibrium points, analyze stability,\ninvestigate zero-velocity planes, and calculate the relative errors between the\ngravitational field modeled by PSEM and the results obtained using both the\nclassical polyhedral method by Tsoulis and Petrovic and the mass concentration\nmethod. Our results highlight the computational efficiency of PSEM in modeling\nthe gravitational potential of irregularly shaped bodies. This efficiency stems\nfrom expressing the gravitational potential through a homogeneous analytical\nfunction that is easy to manipulate algebraically, enabling explicit\ndetermination of the acceleration vector.

To overcome limitations of\nexisting tools, we introduce BUCOR (Build Conflict Resolver), a new conflict\nresolver. BUCOR first detects conflicts by comparing three versions related to\na merging scenario: base b, left l, and right r. To resolve conflicts, it\nemploys two complementary strategies: example-based transformation (BUCOR-E)\nand rule-based transformation (BUCOR-R). BUCOR-R applies predefined rules to\nhandle common, well-understood conflicts. BUCOR-E mines branch versions (l and\nr) for exemplar edits applied to fix related build errors. From these examples,\nit infers and generalizes program transformation patterns to resolve more\ncomplex conflicts.\n  We evaluated BUCOR on 88 real-world build conflicts spanning 21 distinct\nconflict types.

We find that Cosmic Explorer will\nbe able to distinguish such systems primarily via the measurement of tidal\neffects in the late inspiral. Neutron star binaries with \\emph{reduced tidal\ndeformability} $\\tilde\\Lambda$ as small as ${\\sim}3.5$ can be identified up to\na distance of 100 Mpc, while neutron star binaries with $\\tilde\\Lambda\\sim22$\ncan be identified to distances greater than 250 Mpc. This is larger than the\ndistance up to which the postmerger will be visible. Finally, we discuss the\npossible implications of our findings for the equation of state of neutron\nstars from the gravitational-wave event GW230529.",

    "abstract": "Utility-scale quantum computing requires quantum error correction (QEC) to\nprotect quantum information against noise. Currently, superconducting hardware\nis a promising candidate for achieving fault tolerance due to its fast gate\ntimes and feasible scalability. However, it is often restricted to\ntwo-dimensional nearest-neighbour connectivity, which is thought to be\nincapable of accommodating high-rate quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC)\ncodes that promise to greatly reduce the number of physical qubits needed to\nencode logical qubits. In this paper we construct a new family of qLDPC codes,\nwhich we call ``Directional Codes'', that outperforms the rotated planar code\n(RPC) while naturally meeting the connectivity requirements of the widely\nadopted square-grid, and some even the sparser hexagonal-grid. The key idea is\nto utilise the iSWAP gate -- a natural native gate for superconducting qubits\n-- to construct circuits that measure the stabilisers of these qLDPC codes\nwithout the need for any long-range connections or an increased degree of\nconnectivity. We numerically evaluate the performance of directional codes,\nencoding four, six and twelve logical qubits, using a common\nsuperconducting-inspired circuit-level Pauli noise model. We also compare them\nto the RPC and to the bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, currently the two most\npopular quantum LDPC code families. As a concrete example, directional codes\noutperform the RPC by achieving approximately the same logical error\nprobability at physical error rate $p=10^{-3}$ using only $18.75-45\\%$ of the\nphysical qubits at distance up to $10$. Our discovery represents a breakthrough\nin QEC code design that suggests complex long-range, high-connectivity hardware\nmay not be necessary for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation.",

    "abstract": "Disconnections, now recognized as key mediators of grain boundary (GB)\nkinetics in polycrystals, have traditionally been associated with thermal or\nmechanical activation. Here, using atomistic simulations across multiple binary\nalloys (Al-Ni, Al-Fe, etc.), we reveal a distinct disconnection formation\nmechanism solely activated by interstitial solute segregation. This process\nexhibits a zero-nucleation energy barrier, contrasting sharply with\nconventional disconnection nucleation. We identify two segregation-induced\ndisconnection types: (i) annihilable disconnections that promote GB migration\nand annihilate with continued segregation, and (ii) permanent disconnections\nwith stable dipoles that resist shear, inducing GB amorphization and sliding\nrather than conventional shear-coupled motion. The permanent disconnections\ngenerate localized stress fields that further drive solute accumulation and, at\nhigher concentrations, facilitate precipitation. These disconnections,\nunprecedented in pure systems, follow unique nucleation pathways as confirmed\nby dichromatic pattern analysis and persist across diverse crystal structures.\nThis work establishes solute segregation as a route for barrier-free\ndisconnection formation, fundamentally altering our understanding of GB\nkinetics in alloys.",

This paper introduces Step-3, a\n321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for\nminimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel\nMulti-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces\nboth KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention\nexpressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed\ninference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers\ninto specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost\nefficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared\nwith models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at\nlonger context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per\ntoken (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that\nhardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are\ncritical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with\nDeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs\nachieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under\n50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324\nin the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.",

We calculate the JQ parameter in different\nmodels and compare them with the experimental data obtained in heavy-ions\nstudies. In particular, we investigate how JQ, as a function of temperature\n$T$, chemical potential $\\mu$, and magnetic field $c_B$, serves as a probe for\nidentifying first-order phase transitions within the $(T,\\mu,c_B)$ parameter\nspace of holographic QCD. Particular attention is paid to the dependence of JQ\non the parameter $\\nu$, which characterizes longitudinal versus transverse\nanisotropy relative to the heavy-ion collision axis. By analyzing the\ndependence of the JQ parameters on these thermodynamic variables, we map\ncritical regions associated with phase boundaries.

The neutron flux (and therefore fusion power) can be indirectly\ncalculated using neutron activation analyses, where potentially large numbers\nof activation foils are placed in the neutron flux, and delayed gammas from key\nreactions are measured via gamma spectrometry. In gamma spectrometry, absolute\nefficiency forms part of the activity calculation, and equals to the ratio of\nthe total number of photons detected to the number emitted by a radioactive\nsample. Hence, it is imperative that they are calculated efficiently and\naccurately. This paper presents a novel digital efficiency calculation\nalgorithm, the Machine Learning Based Efficiency Calculator (MaLBEC), that uses\nstate-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques to calculate efficiency\nvalues of a given sample, from only four inputs. In this paper, the performance\nof the MaLBEC is demonstrated with a fusion sample and compares the values to a\ntraditional efficiency calculation method, Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP). The\nefficiencies from the MaLBEC were within an average 5\\% of the ones produced by\nMCNP, but with an exceptional reduction in computation time of 99.96\\%.

This disconnect between early\ndiscovery and late development is one of the main drivers of high failure rates\nin drug discovery. The true promise of AI lies not in augmenting current\nexperiments but in enabling virtual experiments that are impossible in the real\nworld: testing novel compounds directly in silico in the human body. Recent\nadvances in AI, high-throughput perturbation assays, and single-cell and\nspatial omics across species now make it possible to construct programmable\nvirtual humans: dynamic, multiscale models that simulate drug actions from\nmolecular to phenotypic levels. By bridging the translational gap, programmable\nvirtual humans offer a transformative path to optimize therapeutic efficacy and\nsafety earlier than ever before. This perspective introduces the concept of\nprogrammable virtual humans, explores their roles in a new paradigm of drug\ndiscovery centered on human physiology, and outlines key opportunities,\nchallenges, and roadmaps for their realization.",

While neuromodulators such as norepinephrine (NE) allow it\nto be both robust and flexible for all living beings to interact with their\nenvironment, the basis for how neuromodulation impacts neuron-specific\nproperties remains poorly understood. In this work, we examine how NE\ninfluences different preB\\\"otC neuronal subtypes by modeling its effects\nthrough modulating two key parameters: calcium-activated nonspecific cationic\ncurrent gating conductance ($g_{\\rm CAN}$) and inositol-triphosphate ($\\rm\nIP_3$), guided by experimental studies.

Furthermore, using methods of\ndynamical systems theory, we uncover the mechanisms by which NE differentially\nmodulates burst frequency and duration in NaP-dependent and CAN-dependent\nbursting neurons.

The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed\napproach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic\nsystemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents\na fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a\ndynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain\nevent logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential\nTime-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly\ndetection.

    "abstract": "The long-context capability of recent large transformer models can be\nsurmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as\nhardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to\nscale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic\ncomputational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this\npaper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device\nusing generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and\ninference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic\nsingle device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions\n-- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between\naccuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE\n(Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient\ntransformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse\nmodalities.

    "abstract": "Model multiplicity refers to the existence of multiple machine learning\nmodels that describe the data equally well but may produce different\npredictions on individual samples. In medicine, these models can admit\nconflicting predictions for the same patient -- a risk that is poorly\nunderstood and insufficiently addressed.\n  In this study, we empirically analyze the extent, drivers, and ramifications\nof predictive multiplicity across diverse medical tasks and model\narchitectures, and show that even small ensembles can mitigate/eliminate\npredictive multiplicity in practice. Our analysis reveals that (1) standard\nvalidation metrics fail to identify a uniquely optimal model and (2) a\nsubstantial amount of predictions hinges on arbitrary choices made during model\ndevelopment. Using multiple models instead of a single model reveals instances\nwhere predictions differ across equally plausible models -- highlighting\npatients that would receive arbitrary diagnoses if any single model were used.\nIn contrast, (3) a small ensemble paired with an abstention strategy can\neffectively mitigate measurable predictive multiplicity in practice;\npredictions with high inter-model consensus may thus be amenable to automated\nclassification. While accuracy is not a principled antidote to predictive\nmultiplicity, we find that (4) higher accuracy achieved through increased model\ncapacity reduces predictive multiplicity.\n  Our findings underscore the clinical importance of accounting for model\nmultiplicity and advocate for ensemble-based strategies to improve diagnostic\nreliability.

This review\nexamines AI applications across the entire cryoEM pipeline, from automated\nparticle picking using convolutional neural networks (Topaz, crYOLO,\nCryoSegNet) to computational solutions for preferred orientation bias\n(spIsoNet, cryoPROS) and advanced denoising algorithms (Topaz-Denoise).

These AI-enhanced approaches have achieved\nnear-atomic resolution reconstructions with minimal manual intervention,\nresolved previously intractable datasets suffering from severe orientation\nbias, and enabled successful application to diverse biological systems from HIV\nvirus-like particles to in situ ribosomal complexes.

These networks are optimized per scan to\nreconstruct the dynamic image series directly from undersampled k-space data.\nML-DIP was evaluated on (i) a 3D cine digital phantom with simulated premature\nventricular contractions (PVCs), (ii) ten healthy subjects (including two\nscanned during both rest and exercise), and (iii) five patients with PVCs.\nPhantom results were assessed using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and\nstructural similarity index measure (SSIM). In vivo performance was evaluated\nby comparing left-ventricular function quantification (against 2D real-time\ncine) and image quality (against 2D real-time cine and binning-based 5D-Cine).\n  Results: In the phantom study, ML-DIP achieved PSNR > 29 dB and SSIM > 0.90\nfor scan times as short as two minutes, while recovering cardiac motion,\nrespiratory motion, and PVC events. In healthy subjects, ML-DIP yielded\nfunctional measurements comparable to 2D cine and higher image quality than\n5D-Cine, including during exercise with high heart rates and bulk motion.

Due to the high\nreliability and availability requirements of connected vehicles, it is crucial\nto resolve any occurring failures quickly. To achieve this however, a complex\ncloud/edge architecture with a mesh of dependencies must be navigated to\ndiagnose the responsible root cause. As such, manual analyses become unfeasible\nsince they would significantly delay the troubleshooting.\n  To address this challenge, this paper presents SDVDiag, an extensible\nplatform for the automated diagnosis of connected vehicle functions. The\nplatform enables the creation of pipelines that cover all steps from initial\ndata collection to the tracing of potential root causes. In addition, SDVDiag\nsupports self-adaptive behavior by the ability to exchange modules at runtime.\nDependencies between functions are detected and continuously updated, resulting\nin a dynamic graph view of the system. In addition, vital system metrics are\nmonitored for anomalies. Whenever an incident is investigated, a snapshot of\nthe graph is taken and augmented by relevant anomalies. Finally, the analysis\nis performed by traversing the graph and creating a ranking of the most likely\ncauses.\n  To evaluate the platform, it is deployed inside an 5G test fleet environment\nfor connected vehicle functions. The results show that injected faults can be\ndetected reliably.

The\nsecond order Josephson term is mapped to a U(1) gauge field, known to be\ntrivially confining in two dimensions, and we argue that a Coulomb-gas analysis\nis not applicable to the dual theory. Instead, we appeal to the vast knowledge\nof gauge theory and infer that the only phase transition out of low-temperature\nordered phase is an Ising transition driven by condensation of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\ndomain wall loops. The domain wall loops can be seen as a surviving vestige of\nsingle-layer vortex-anti-vortex pair, heavily deformed by the second order\nJosephson coupling.

Each risk category includes\nexplicitly malicious (\"direct\") and plausibly benign (\"indirect\") prompt\nvariants.

Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly\naligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method\nensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with\nparticular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely\nobserved classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)\nclustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by\nStudent t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered\nembeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the\nfeatures. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\\% points in\nzero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from\nprevious SOTA models.",

We introduce a Single-Cluster approximation,\nwhich is analytically treatable, tailored to capture the biologically relevant\nregime of rare and long antibiotic-induced pauses. This biologically\nconstrained model reveals three key insights: (i) the inhibition of\nantibiotic-induced translation strongly depends on transcript length, with\nlonger transcripts being disproportionately affected; (ii) reducing ribosome\ninitiation rates significantly mitigates antibiotic vulnerability; and (iii)\ninhibition of translation is governed more by collective ribosome dynamics than\nby single-ribosome properties.

We performed hardware verification of the channel response of the\ncritically sampled PFB and of the delay correction, showing both to be\nconsistent with theoretical expectations. Furthermore, the board was installed\nat the Effelsberg 100-meter radio telescope where we performed commensal pulsar\nobservations with the Effelsberg Direct Digitization backend, showing\ncomparable performance.

    "abstract": "Multimedia fingerprinting is a technique to protect the copyrighted contents\nagainst being illegally redistributed under various collusion attack models.\nAveraging attack is the most fair choice for each colluder to avoid detection,\nand also makes the pirate copy have better perceptional quality. This makes\nsuch an attack one of the most feasible approaches to carrying out collusion.\nIn order to trace all the colluders, several types of multimedia fingerprinting\ncodes were introduced to construct fingerprints resistant to averaging attacks\non multimedia contents, such as AND anti-collusion codes (AND-ACCs), binary\nseparable codes (SCs), logical anti-collusion codes (LACCs), binary frameproof\ncodes (FPCs), binary strongly-separable codes (SSCs) and binary secure code\nwith list decoding (SCLDs). Then codes with the rate as high as possible are\ndesired. However, the existing fingerprinting codes have low code rate due to\nthe strong combinatorial structure. The reason is that the previous research\nmethods adopted simple tracing algorithms. In this paper, we first propose\nnovel tracing algorithms and then find appropriate fingerprinting codes with\nweaker combinatorial structure, i.e., the binary strongly identifiable parent\nproperty code for multimedia fingerprinting (SMIPPC) and its concatenated code.\nTheoretical comparisons and numerical comparisons show that SMIPPCs have higher\ncode rates than those of the existing codes due to their weaker combinatorial\nstructures. It is worth noting that SMIPPCs can only trace a part of colluders\nby using the previous tracing algorithm and the concatenated SMIPPC may be not\nan SMIPPC. This implies that our tracing algorithms have strong traceability.",

Since applications require\nefficient scaling with system size, such models cannot act on fully connected\natomistic graphs and thus neglect interactions beyond a certain cutoff,\nconsequently failing to model long-range effects like electrostatics,\ndispersion, or electron delocalization. While long-range correction schemes\nbased on inverse power laws of interatomic distances have been proposed, they\nare unable to communicate higher-order geometric information and are thus\nlimited in applicability. To address this shortcoming, we propose the use of\nequivariant, rather than scalar, charges for long-range interactions, and\ndesign a graph neural network architecture, LOREM, around this long-range\nmessage passing mechanism. Through tests on a number of long-range datasets, we\nconfirm that equivariant charges enable the learning of orientation-dependent\ninteractions, and that the proposed model is competitive with, or surpasses,\nother approaches.

    "abstract": "Surface contamination not only influences but in some cases even dominates\nthe measured properties of two-dimensional materials. Although different\ncleaning methods are often used for contamination removal, commonly used\nspectroscopic cleanliness assessment methods can leave the level of achieved\ncleanliness ambiguous. Despite two decades of research on 2D materials, the\ntrue cleanliness of the used samples is often left open to interpretation. In\nthis work, freestanding monolayer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride are\nannealed at different temperatures in a custom-built ultra-high vacuum heating\nchamber, connected to a scanning transmission electron microscope via a vacuum\ntransfer line, enabling atomically resolved cleanliness characterization as a\nfunction of annealing temperature, while eliminating the introduction of\nairborne contamination during sample transport. While annealing at 200 {\\deg}C\nalready reduces contamination significantly, it is not until 400 {\\deg}C or\nhigher, where over 90% of the free-standing monolayer areas are atomically\nclean. At this point, further contamination removal is mainly limited by\ndefects in the material and metal contamination introduced during the sample\ntransfer or growth. The achieved large, atomically clean areas can then be used\nfor further nanoscale engineering steps or device processing, facilitating\ninteraction with the material rather than contamination.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we aim to imitate the human ability to selectively attend to a\nsingle speaker, even in the presence of multiple simultaneous talkers. To\nachieve this, we propose a novel approach for binaural target speaker\nextraction that leverages the listener's Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF)\nto isolate the desired speaker. Notably, our method does not rely on speaker\nembeddings, making it speaker-independent and enabling strong generalization\nacross multiple speech datasets and languages. We employ a fully complex-valued\nneural network that operates directly on the complex-valued Short-Time Fourier\ntransform (STFT) of the mixed audio signals, and compare it to a Real-Imaginary\n(RI)-based neural network, demonstrating the advantages of the former. We first\nevaluate the method in an anechoic, noise-free scenario, achieving excellent\nextraction performance while preserving the binaural cues of the target signal.\nWe then extend the evaluation to reverberant conditions. Our method proves\nrobust, maintaining speech clarity and source directionality while\nsimultaneously reducing reverberation. A comparative analysis with existing\nbinaural Target Speaker Extraction (TSE) methods demonstrates that our approach\nattains performance on par with competing techniques in terms of noise\nreduction and perceptual quality, while offering a clear advantage in\npreserving binaural cues.Demo-page: https://bi-ctse-hrtf.github.io",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is increasingly leveraged across various domains to\nautomate decision-making processes that significantly impact human lives. In\nmedical image analysis, deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable\nperformance. However, their inherent complexity makes them black box systems,\nraising concerns about reliability and interpretability. Counterfactual\nexplanations provide comprehensible insights into decision processes by\npresenting hypothetical \"what-if\" scenarios that alter model classifications.\nBy examining input alterations, counterfactual explanations provide patterns\nthat influence the decision-making process. Despite their potential, generating\nplausible counterfactuals that adhere to similarity constraints providing\nhuman-interpretable explanations remains a challenge. In this paper, we\ninvestigate this challenge by a model-specific optimization approach. While\ndeep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) exhibit\nsignificant generative power, probabilistic models like sum-product networks\n(SPNs) efficiently represent complex joint probability distributions. By\nmodeling the likelihood of a semi-supervised VAE's latent space with an SPN, we\nleverage its dual role as both a latent space descriptor and a classifier for a\ngiven discrimination task. This formulation enables the optimization of latent\nspace counterfactuals that are both close to the original data distribution and\naligned with the target class distribution. We conduct experimental evaluation\non the cheXpert dataset. To evaluate the effectiveness of the integration of\nSPNs, our SPN-guided latent space manipulation is compared against a neural\nnetwork baseline. Additionally, the trade-off between latent variable\nregularization and counterfactual quality is analyzed.",

Existing\ndefenses mainly focus on securing monolithic firmware images, leaving\nmodule-level customization -a growing user demand-largely unprotected and\ninsufficiently explored. To address this gap, we conduct a pilot study on the\nupdate workflows of 200 Linux-based IoT devices across 23 vendors, uncovering\nfive previously undocumented vulnerabilities caused by customization practices.\nA broader analysis of update-related CVEs from 2020 to 2024 reveals that over\nhalf originate from customization-induced issues. These findings highlight a\ncritical yet underexamined reality: as customization increases, so does the\nattack surface, while current defenses fail to keep pace. We propose IMUP\n(Integrity-Centric Modular Update Platform), the first framework to address two\nkey challenges: constructing a trustworthy cross-module integrity chain and\nscaling update performance under mass customization. IMUP combines three\ntechniques: per-module chameleon hashing for integrity, server-side\nproof-of-work offloading to reduce device overhead, and server-side caching to\nreuse module combinations, minimizing rebuild costs. Security analysis shows\nthat even when 95 percent of secret keys are exposed, forging a valid image\nincurs over 300 times the cost of the legitimate server. Experiments on\nheterogeneous IoT devices demonstrate that IMUP reduces server-side generation\ntime by 2.9 times and device downtime by 5.9 times compared to a\npackage-manager baseline.",

    "abstract": "We present a study of the cold molecular versus the ionized gas distribution\nin three nearby Seyfert galaxies: NGC 6860, Mrk 915 and MCG -01-24-012. To\nconstrain the cold molecular flux distribution at $\\sim$ 0.5 -\n0.8$^{\\prime\\prime}$ ($\\sim$ 150 - 400 pc) scales, we used data from the\nCO(2-1) emission line, obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter\nArray (ALMA). For the ionized gas, we used Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nnarrow-band images, centered on the [O III]$\\lambda\\lambda$4959,5007 emission\nlines. Within the inner kiloparsec of the three galaxies, we observe gaps in\nthe CO emission in regions co-spatial with the [O III] flux distribution,\nsimilarly to what has been recently observed in other active galaxies. From our\noriginal sample of 13 nearby AGN sources, 12 objects present the same trend.\nThis indicates that CO molecules might be partially dissociated by AGN\nradiation or that there is a deficit of cold molecular gas on nuclear scales\ndriven by ionized gas outflows/jets. If so, this represents a form of AGN\nfeedback that is not captured when only outflow kinematics properties, such as\nmass outflow rates, are considered. We also discuss that part of the molecular\ngas might still be present in hotter H$_2$ phases, as observed already in other\nobjects.",

    "abstract": "Recently, recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear\ncomputational complexity have re-emerged as efficient alternatives to\nself-attention-based LLMs (Self-Attention LLMs), which have quadratic\ncomplexity. However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks\ndue to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused\non enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural\ninnovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match\nthe performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that\nthis limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not\nwell-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a\nchunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth\nReading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual\ninformation, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more\ncompatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method\nsubstantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention\nLLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of\nRecurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from\n5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.\nBesides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and\ninferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using\nRecurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks.

This work\nexplores the reconstruction of such spatial signals from sparse measurements\nusing Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs), offering a\nlow-complexity alternative to traditional neural networks. The concept of\nGENEO, which originated in topological data analysis (TDA), is a mathematical\ntool used in machine learning to represent agents modelled as functional\noperators acting on data while incorporating application-specific invariances.\nLeveraging these invariances reduces the number of parameters with respect to\ntraditional neural networks and mitigates data scarcity by enforcing known\nalgebraic and geometric constraints that reflect symmetries in the agents'\nactions. In this paper, we introduce a novel GENEO-based approach for SINR map\nreconstruction in urban wireless communication networks using extremely sparse\nsampling. We demonstrate that this mathematical framework achieves competitive\nperformance compared to established methods.

    "abstract": "We present a concise review and perspective on noise-induced synchronization\nand coherence protection in open quantum systems, with emphasis on recent work\ninvolving coupled spins, oscillators, and anyons. When local environments\nexhibit internal correlations, the structure of the noise determines which\ncollective modes become decoherence-protected. This leads to steady-state\nentanglement, phase locking, and exceptional points (EPs) in the Liouvillian\nspectrum, signaling a collapse of the mode basis and the emergence of\nnon-dissipative stabilized dynamics. Using a Lindblad framework, we show that\nsymmetry in the noise correlations acts as a control parameter, protecting\nsymmetric or antisymmetric modes depending on the sign of the correlation. In\nthe pure-dephasing limit, coherence decay mirrors the Anderson-Kubo model,\nwhere the effective fluctuation strength scales as $\\sigma^2(1 \\pm \\xi)$, and\nthe dynamical regime (Gaussian vs. Lorentzian) is set by the ratio \\( \\sigma /\n\\gamma \\). Thus, the environment not only drives decoherence but can also\nselectively suppress it through symmetry filtering. We also revisit historical\nand conceptual origins of this idea, beginning with Huygens synchronized\npendulum clocks and culminating in modern non-Hermitian dynamics. Correlated\nnoise-though classically stochastic-can organize quantum dynamics and protect\ncoherence without direct control over the system. These insights offer a\nunifying view of synchronization in classical and quantum regimes, with\nimplications for quantum sensing, engineered decoherence, and long-lived\ncoherence in complex environments such as biological light-harvesting complexes\nor avian magnetoreception.",

We study the influence of the spacetime noncommutativity on the Dirac\nquasinormal modes in the modified Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole spacetime.\nThe framework for the latter study is provided by a certain effective model of\ngravity coupled to fermions which in itself encapsulates noncommutative\ndeformation. This model describes a classical Dirac field coupled to a modified\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om geometry where the corresponding metric acquires an\nadditional nonvanishing $r-\\varphi $ component. As the earlier study shows,\nthis model appears to be equivalent to a model of semiclassical NC gauge theory\nin which a NC gauge field is being coupled to a NC fermion field on the one\nside and the classical Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om background on the other. In\ncomparison to the undeformed model where the Dirac field is coupled to the\ncommutative Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole, the numerical results show that\nthe oscillation frequencies and magnitude of damping of the Dirac quasinormal\nmodes change to an extent that cannot be neglected. In fact, the influence of\nspacetime noncommutativity is shown to produce features reminiscent of a\nZeeman-like splitting in the effective potential and quasinormal-mode spectrum.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the impact of a hypothesized delayed initiation of inflation,\ncharacterized by a cutoff k_min to the primordial power spectrum in the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB). This cutoff affects both the scalar and tensor\nspectra, which therefore impacts several measurements of the temperature and\npolarization distributions. We calculate the angular power spectrum and\ncorrelation function with and without k_min in the context of Planck-LCDM, and\ndemonstrate that a non-zero k_min significantly improves the alignment between\ntheory and the observations, including the temperature, E-mode polarization, TE\ncross-correlation, Q+U polarization and Q-U polarization. It creates an\nobservable signature in both the angular power spectrum and correlation\nfunction for all cases. We thus also explore the B-mode polarization, for which\ncurrent data are not yet precise enough to determine k_min, but whose impact\nshould be detectable with high-precision measurements using future missions,\nsuch as LiteBIRD, if the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, is not much smaller than\nits current upper limit. We find that the introduction of k_min not only\naddresses large-angle anomalies in the CMB but also provides a more consistent\nframework for understanding the early Universe's inflationary phase. These\nfindings highlight the importance of future high-precision CMB observations in\nvalidating the existence and implications of k_min.",

How cells\nintegrate and prioritize competing signals remains unclear. For instance, in\nthe presence of opposing chemoattractant gradients, how do cells decide which\ndirection to go? When should local signals dominate distant ones? A key factor\nin these processes is the precision with which cells sense each gradient, which\ndepends non-monotonically on concentrations. Here, we study how gradient\nsensing accuracy shapes cell navigation in the presence of two distinct\nchemoattractant sources. We model cells as active random walkers that sense\nlocal gradients and combine these estimates to reorient their movement. Our\nresults show that cells sensing multiple gradients can display a range of\nchemotactic behaviors, including anisotropic spatial patterns and varying\ndegrees of confinement, depending on gradient shape and source location. The\nmodel also predicts cases where cells exhibit multistep navigation across\nsources or a hierarchical response toward one source, driven by disparities in\ntheir sensitivity to each chemoattractant.

If $X$ is Markov chain,\nthen such path can be efficiently found using the celebrated Viterbi algorithm.\nHowever, when $X$ is not Markovian, identifying the most probable path --\nhereafter referred to as the Viterbi path -- becomes computationally expensive.\nIn this paper, we explore the branch-and-bound method for finding Viterbi\npaths. The method is based on the lower and upper bounds on maximum probability\n$\\max_x P(X=x)$, and the objective of the paper is to exploit the joint Markov\nproperty of $(X,Y)$ to calculate possibly good bounds in possibly cheap way.\n  This research is motivated by decoding or segmentation problem in triplet\nMarkov models. A triplet Markov model is trivariate homogeneous Markov process\n$(X,U,Y)$. In decoding, a realization of one marginal process $Y$ is observed\n(representing the data), while $X$ and $U$ are latent processes.

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) and dynamic 3D+time (4D) reconstruction of coronary\narteries from X-ray coronary angiography (CA) has the potential to improve\nclinical procedures. However, there are multiple challenges to be addressed,\nmost notably, blood-vessel structure sparsity, poor background and blood vessel\ndistinction, sparse-views, and intra-scan motion. State-of-the-art\nreconstruction approaches rely on time-consuming manual or error-prone\nautomatic segmentations, limiting clinical usability. Recently, approaches\nbased on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise for automatic\nreconstructions in the sparse-view setting. However, they suffer from long\ntraining times due to their dependence on MLP-based representations. We propose\nNerT-CA, a hybrid approach of Neural and Tensorial representations for\naccelerated 4D reconstructions with sparse-view CA. Building on top of the\nprevious NeRF-based work, we model the CA scene as a decomposition of low-rank\nand sparse components, utilizing fast tensorial fields for low-rank static\nreconstruction and neural fields for dynamic sparse reconstruction. Our\napproach outperforms previous works in both training time and reconstruction\naccuracy, yielding reasonable reconstructions from as few as three angiogram\nviews. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on\nrepresentative 4D phantom datasets.",

    "abstract": "Measuring proton-proton interaction cross-sections at center-of-mass energies\nabove 40 TeV remains a significant challenge in particle physics. The Pierre\nAuger Observatory provides a unique opportunity to study the interactions at\nthe highest energies through the distribution of the depth of maximum shower\ndevelopment ($X_\\mathrm{max}$) observed by its Fluorescence Detector. In\nprevious studies, the determination of the interaction cross-section at\nultrahigh energies has relied on the assumption that the tail of the\n$X_\\mathrm{max}$ distribution is proton-dominated, which restricts the analysis\nto a limited energy range below the ankle and introduces related systematic\nuncertainties. In this contribution, we adopt a novel method for the\nsimultaneous estimation of the proton-proton interaction cross-section and the\nprimary cosmic-ray mass composition using data from the Pierre Auger\nObservatory, avoiding assumptions about one quantity to infer the other and\nthus improving the accuracy and robustness of our analysis. In addition, a\nsystematic shift in the $X_\\mathrm{max}$ scale is fitted to account for both\nexperimental uncertainties and theoretical constraints on the modeling of\nparticle interactions. The obtained results are consistent with previous\nanalyses and provide additional constraints on hadronic interaction models. The\nmeasured proton-proton inelastic cross-section at ultra-high energies agrees\nwell with extrapolations of accelerator data. The inferred cosmic-ray\ncomposition and the $X_\\mathrm{max}$-scale shift are also compatible with\nprevious estimates.",

Motivated by this, we investigate the influence of\nfermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) on the equilibrium structure of\nprogenitor cores and the formation of their neutron star remnants. Using a\ngeneral relativistic two-fluid formalism, we model the coupled evolution of\nordinary matter (OM) and ADM, treated as separately conserved fluids\ninteracting solely through gravity. Our analysis focuses on neon-rich white\ndwarfs (Ne WDs), which are typical progenitor cores for ECSNe. We assume\nconservation of both baryon number ($N_B$) and dark matter particle number\n($N_D$) during collapse, allowing for a consistent mapping between progenitor\nand remnant configurations. We find that ADM significantly enhances the central\ndensity of the WD progenitor. This lowers the threshold gravitational mass\n$M^*$ required to initiate electron capture, enabling ECSNe from lower-mass\nprogenitors. The resulting remnants are stable, dark matter-admixed neutron\nstars with gravitational masses potentially well below current observational\nbounds. Moreover, we find that the conversion energy during the WD-to-NS\nconversion is also significantly reduced for higher ADM particle masses and\nfractions, suggesting that unusually low-energy ECSNe may serve as potential\nindicators of ADM involvement in stellar collapse.",

    "abstract": "The age distribution function of star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC) is known to present a feature called the cluster age gap, a period of\ntime from ~ 4 to 11 Gyr ago with a remarkable small number of clusters\nidentified. In this work we performed an in-depth analysis of three recently\ncatalogued age gap cluster candidates with the aim of confirming their physical\nnature. We used GEMINI@GMOS g,i photometry centred on the objects to build\ncolour-magnitude diagrams from which we recognised their main features. We also\nperformed an automatic search of stellar overdensities using Gaussian mixture\nmodel techniques and analysed the corresponding colour-magnitude diagrams\nsimilarly as performed for the aforementioned candidates. The present GEMINI\ndata sets would seem to discard any strong evidence of these object being real\nclusters, and rather support the possibility of the result of stellar density\nvariations of the LMC field star distribution. These three objects, in addition\nto other 17 new identified candidates, are placed in the LMC outermost disc in\na limited region toward the southwest from the LMC centre. They had embraced\nthe possibility to answer the long-time conundrum about the absence of LMC age\ngap clusters. From an statistical approach, combined with the knowledge of the\nexpected LMC age-metallicity relationship, and recent simulations of the\ninteraction between the LMC and the Milky Way, we provide not only evidence\nagainst the physical nature of the studied objects, but also an interpretation\non the lack of identification of more LMC age gap clusters.",

To address that, we propose a MultiStream\nDetection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information\nfrom both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure.

Manual blood cell checks for disease detection are\nknown to be time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone. To address these\nlimitations, analyzing blood cells using deep learning-based object detectors\ncan be regarded as a feasible solution. In this study, we propose automatic\nblood cell detection method (ABCD) based on an improved version of YOLOX, an\nobject detector, for detecting various types of blood cells, including white\nblood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Firstly, we introduce the\nConvolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the network's backbone to\nenhance the efficiency of feature extraction. Furthermore, we introduce the\nAdaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) into the network's neck, which\noptimizes the fusion of different features extracted from various stages of the\nnetwork. Finally, to speed up the model's convergence, we substitute the\nIntersection over Union (IOU) loss function with the Complete Intersection over\nUnion (CIOU) loss function. The experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method is more effective than other existing methods for BCCD dataset.\nCompared to the baseline algorithm, our method ABCD achieved 95.49 % mAP@0.5\nand 86.89 % mAP@0.5-0.9, which are 2.8% and 23.41% higher, respectively, and\nincreased the detection speed by 2.9%, making it highly efficient for real-time\napplications.",

While existing\nconditional diffusion models incrementally generate motions by conditioning on\npreviously generated characters, they rely on single shared prompts, limiting\nnuanced control and leading to overly simplified interactions. In this paper,\nwe introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel,\ntraining-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable\ninteractions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group\ninteractions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages\npretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose\ngroup interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts\nsuch as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs\nphysics-based penalties during noise optimization. This approach allows precise\nuser control over character orientation, speed, and spatial relationships\nwithout additional training. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PINO\ngenerates visually realistic, physically coherent, and adaptable multi-person\ninteractions suitable for diverse animation, gaming, and robotics applications.",

When the boundary of $M$\nis incompressible, the renormalized volume is always positive, otherwise there\nare sequences of convex co-compact structures on $M$ whose renormalized volumes\ndiverge to minus infinity.\n  We define here a new version of the renormalized volume which adapts to the\ncompressible boundary case, satisfying properties analogous to those of the\nclassical one in the incompressible setting. In particular, the adapted\nrenormalized volume is bounded from below, its differential has uniformly\nbounded supremum norm, and its gradient has uniformly bounded Weil-Petersson\nnorm. Moreover, it stays at uniformly bounded distance from the convex core\nvolume function. As a corollary, we obtain a bound on the convex core volume of\nhandlebodies in terms of the Weil-Petersson distance from a subset of the\nTeichm\\\"uller space. Furthermore, the adapted renormalized volume extends\ncontinuously, as a function on the Teichm\\\"uller space of $\\partial\\bar M$, to\nthe strata in the boundary of its Weil-Petersson completion corresponding to\ncompressible multicurves.

This problem is of central importance to algorithms across scientific\ncomputing and machine learning, with applications to fast multiplication and\ninversion for structured matrices, building preconditioners for first-order\noptimization, and as a model for differential operator learning. Prior work\nfocuses on obtaining query complexity upper and lower bounds for learning\nspecific structured matrix families that commonly arise in applications.\n  We initiate the study of the problem in greater generality, aiming to\nunderstand the query complexity of learning approximations from general matrix\nfamilies. Our main result focuses on finding a near-optimal approximation to\n$A$ from any finite-sized family of matrices, $\\mathcal{F}$. Standard results\nfrom matrix sketching show that $O(\\log|\\mathcal{F}|)$ matvec queries suffice\nin this setting. This bound can also be achieved, and is optimal, for\nvector-matrix-vector queries of the form $x,y\\rightarrow x^TAy$, which have\nbeen widely studied in work on rank-$1$ matrix sensing.\n  Surprisingly, we show that, in the matvec model, it is possible to obtain a\nnearly quadratic improvement in complexity, to\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\log|\\mathcal{F}|})$. Further, we prove that this bound is\ntight up to log-log factors.Via covering number arguments, our result extends\nto well-studied infinite families. As an example, we establish that a\nnear-optimal approximation from any \\emph{linear matrix family} of dimension\n$q$ can be learned with $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{q})$ matvec queries, improving on an\n$O(q)$ bound achievable via sketching techniques and vector-matrix-vector\nqueries.",

However, despite the virtual nature of its services, the\nsector remains inherently constrained by its materiality and cannot rely on an\ninfinite pool of resources. As a result, the wide variety of supported services\nmay need to be managed under stricter limits within hosting facilities in the\nfuture. Contrary to common assumptions, we show that tenants typically do not\nshare computing resources, even in environments commonly perceived as\nmutualized, such as cloud platforms. Time-sharing has been progressively phased\nout for reasons of performance, security, predictability, and, perhaps more\nimportantly, due to the decreasing cost of computing resources. This paper\nadvocates for managing fewer physical resources by improving resource sharing\nbetween tenants. It represents a paradigm shift, moving beyond traditional\ntime-sharing at the hardware level to a higher abstraction. This approach\nentails \"doing with fewer resources\" under conditions of \"reduced performance\".\nNonetheless, enhancing the mutualization of infrastructure can reduce cluster\nsizes (through consolidation) and improve energy efficiency, with gains related\nto the accepted performance trade-off, a situation potentially more socially\nacceptable than eliminating services.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Accurate tumor segmentation is vital for adaptive radiation therapy\n(ART) but remains time-consuming and user-dependent. Segment Anything Model 2\n(SAM2) shows promise for prompt-based segmentation but struggles with tumor\naccuracy. We propose prior knowledge-based augmentation strategies to enhance\nSAM2 for ART.\n  Methods: Two strategies were introduced to improve SAM2: (1) using prior MR\nimages and annotations as contextual inputs, and (2) improving prompt\nrobustness via random bounding box expansion and mask erosion/dilation. The\nresulting model, SAM2-Aug, was fine-tuned and tested on the One-Seq-Liver\ndataset (115 MRIs from 31 liver cancer patients), and evaluated without\nretraining on Mix-Seq-Abdomen (88 MRIs, 28 patients) and Mix-Seq-Brain (86\nMRIs, 37 patients).\n  Results: SAM2-Aug outperformed convolutional, transformer-based, and\nprompt-driven models across all datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.86(liver),\n0.89(abdomen), and 0.90(brain). It demonstrated strong generalization across\ntumor types and imaging sequences, with improved performance in\nboundary-sensitive metrics.\n  Conclusions: Incorporating prior images and enhancing prompt diversity\nsignificantly boosts segmentation accuracy and generalizability. SAM2-Aug\noffers a robust, efficient solution for tumor segmentation in ART. Code and\nmodels will be released at https://github.com/apple1986/SAM2-Aug.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the validity of the mass concentration comparison for a class\nof nonlinear diffusion equations posed on Riemannian manifolds $ \\mathbb{M}^n $\nthat are spherically symmetric, that is, model manifolds. The concentration\ncomparison states that the solution of a certain diffusion equation that takes\nthe radially decreasing (Schwarz) rearrangement $ u_0^\\star $ as its initial\ndatum is more concentrated than the original solution starting from $u_0$. This\nis known to hold in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ as a consequence of the celebrated\nP\\'olya-Szeg\\H{o} inequality, which asserts that the $ L^2 $ norm of the\ngradient of a function $f$ (belonging to an appropriate Sobolev space) is\nalways larger than the $ L^2 $ norm of the gradient of its radially decreasing\nrearrangement $f^\\star$. However, if $ \\mathbb{M}^n $ is a general model\nmanifold, it is not for granted that the P\\'olya-Szeg\\H{o} inequality holds; in\nfact, we will provide a simple condition involving the scalar curvature of\n$\\mathbb{M}^n $ under which such an inequality actually fails.

In particular, the validity of such a comparison\nfor the heat equation is sufficient to guarantee that the same holds for all\nfiltration equations. Moreover, we prove that if $ \\mathbb{M}^n $ supports a\ncentered isoperimetric inequality then the P\\'olya-Szeg\\H{o} inequality, and\nthus the concentration comparison, holds.

The available Gaia-based\ncatalogs of resolved binaries provide the projected angular separation between\nthe components, while the physical semimajor axis is the parameter of interest.\nThe problem of reconstructing the distribution of orbit sizes is complex and\nill-posed, because the observed apparent separations are defined by a number of\nunderlying physical parameters including semimajor axis, eccentricity, orbit\norientation, and orbital phase.

    "abstract": "Channel models are a fundamental component of wireless communication systems,\nproviding critical insights into the physics of radio wave propagation. As\nwireless systems evolve every decade, the development of accurate and\nstandardized channel models becomes increasingly important for the development,\nevaluation and performance assessment of emerging technologies. An effort to\ndevelop a standardized channel model began around 2000 through the Third\nGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP) and the International Telecommunication\nUnion (ITU) with the aim of addressing a broad range of frequencies from sub-1\nGHz to 100 GHz. Prior efforts focused heavily on sub-6 GHz bands and mmWave\nbands, and there exist some gaps in accurately modeling the 7-24 GHz frequency\nrange, a promising candidate band for 6G. To address these gaps, 3GPP approved\na Release (Rel) 19 channel modeling study. This study resulted in several\nenhancements to the channel models, including the ability to accurately model a\nSuburban Macrocell (SMa) scenario, realistic User Terminal (UT) antenna models,\nvariability in the number of clusters, variability in the number of rays per\ncluster, a framework for capturing variability in power among all\npolarizations, near field (NF) propagation, and spatial non-stationarity (SNS)\neffects, all of which may be crucial for future 6G deployments. This paper\npresents the outcomes of this study and provides an overview of the underlying\nrationale, and key discussions that guided the validation, refinement, and\nenhancements of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel models.",

Leading corrections to scaling are studied by using finite size scaling\nof dimensionless quantities, such as the Binder cumulant $U_4$. The spatial\nunisotropy, which causes subleading corrections, is studied by computing the\nexponential correlation length $\\xi_{exp}$ in the high temperature phase for\ndifferent directions. In the case of the $q$-state clock model it turns out\nthat by tuning the ratio of the two coupling constants, we can eliminate either\nleading or subleading corrections to scaling. These points on the critical line\nare close to each other. Hence in the improved model, where leading corrections\nto scaling vanish, also subleading corrections are small.

A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer\n(MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains\nstable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an\nintuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase\naccuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS\n2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it\nconsistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy,\ninterpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing\nmodality scenarios at test time.",

This paper investigates two approaches\nto represent beliefs in games with hidden piece identities: a constraint-based\nmodel using Constraint Satisfaction Problems and a probabilistic extension\nusing Belief Propagation to estimate marginal probabilities. We evaluated the\nimpact of both representations using general-purpose agents across two\ndifferent games.

The approach achieves an 88.54% reduction in model\nsize (from 64.39 MB to 7.38 MB), while improving generalization capability of\nthe model.

We prove that such measurements can always\nbe implemented with interferometry, wherein the conventional density operator,\nthe recently developed quantum state over time (QSOT), and the process matrix\nformalisms smoothly merge. This framework allows for a systematic study of\nmixed states in the temporal setting, which turn out to be crucial for modeling\nquantum non-Markovianity. Based on this, we demonstrate that two different\nensembles of quantum dynamics can be represented by the same QSOT, indicating\nthat they cannot be distinguished through interferometry.

Additionally, due to the\nscarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal\nscenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world\nabnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly\ndetection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key\naspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data\nsimply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth\nand appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the\nflexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly\nGenerator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies\nin RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,\neffectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can\ndirectly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.\nExperiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD\nand Eyecandies datasets.

We find that discs, tori, and bent rods reverse their direction of\nmotion with increasing hydrogen peroxide concentration--moving with their inert\nside forward at low concentrations and with their catalytic side forward at\nhigh concentrations. In contrast, spheres and straight rods do not exhibit this\nreversal. We observe that direction reversal is independent of the base\nmaterial composition of the swimmer and its size, and only occurs for\nanisotropic particles where, due to their elongated shape, the location of the\nsolute concentration maximum is unstable and can be shifted by\nsubstrate-induced confinements.

We introduce a\nnew analytical framework that models the single-step generation process as a\ncomposition of information-processing stages using the language of Markov\ncategories. This compositional perspective provides a unified mathematical\nlanguage to connect three critical aspects of language modeling that are\ntypically studied in isolation: the training objective, the geometry of the\nlearned representation space, and practical model capabilities. First, our\nframework provides a precise information-theoretic rationale for the success of\nmulti-token prediction methods like speculative decoding, quantifying the\n\"information surplus\" a model's hidden state contains about tokens beyond the\nimmediate next one. Second, we clarify how the standard negative log-likelihood\n(NLL) objective compels the model to learn not just the next word, but also the\ndata's intrinsic conditional uncertainty, a process we formalize using\ncategorical entropy. Our central result reveals that NLL training functions as\nan implicit form of spectral contrastive learning. We prove that, for common\nmodel architectures, this simple predictive objective forces the model to\nsculpt a geometrically structured representation space, implicitly aligning\nrepresentations with the eigenspectrum of a \"predictive similarity\" operator.\nThis work offers a powerful new lens to understand how information flows\nthrough a model and how the training objective shapes its internal geometry,\nthereby bridging the gap between learning theory and the practical success of\nlarge language models.",

Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components:\nMulti-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and\nAggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation\nwith semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and\nfusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin\ndatasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance.\nSpecifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\\% mAP\nand 32.8\\% AMOTA.

By tuning the parameters of the lattice\ncontinuously, we illustrate situations where two Dirac points are able to\nannihilate, and others, where this annihilation is topologically obstructed.\nFor a system with no gaps between the three bands, like in the kagome lattice,\nthe Euler number of two bands is ill-defined on the whole Brillouin zone, which\nrequires the introduction of the so-called ``patch\" Euler number on a subregion\nwithout additional degeneracies coming from the third band. A non-zero patch\nEuler number means that the annihilation of the Dirac points is impossible. We\nalso illustrate another point of view, using homotopy theory, associating the\nDirac points with quaternionic charges. We prove that the non-abelian braiding\nof the Dirac points in k-space conjugates their quaternionic charge and\nexplains the possible obstruction to the annihilation of Dirac points.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled\ndata, a necessity in many machine learning applications where anomalous samples\nare rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two\ncategories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies\ntoo well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which\ncan suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to\ncouple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate\nobjectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit\ntheir expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically\nsolvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly\naligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated\non two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI\nsubtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large,\nhyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small,\nnon-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a\nmore clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of\nrobustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and\nscanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness\nof our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world\nmedical imaging applications.

Accordingly, we propose a novel\nframework, Face2VoiceSync, with several novel contributions: 1) Voice-Face\nAlignment, ensuring generated voices match facial appearance; 2) Diversity \\&\nManipulation, enabling generated voice control over paralinguistic features\nspace; 3) Efficient Training, using a lightweight VAE to bridge visual and\naudio large-pretrained models, with significantly fewer trainable parameters\nthan existing methods; 4) New Evaluation Metric, fairly assessing the diversity\nand identity consistency. Experiments show Face2VoiceSync achieves both visual\nand audio state-of-the-art performances on a single 40GB GPU.",

    "abstract": "In studies of exoplanet atmospheres using transmission spectroscopy, Bayesian\nretrievals are the most popular form of analysis. In these procedures it is\ncommon to adopt a Gaussian likelihood. However, this implicitly assumes that\nthe upper and lower error bars on the spectral points are equal. With recent\nobservations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offering higher quality\nof data, it is worth revisiting this assumption to understand the impact that\nan asymmetry between the error bars may have on retrieved parameters. In this\nstudy, we challenge the approximation by comparing retrievals using a\nsymmetric, Gaussian likelihood, and an asymmetric, split normal likelihood. We\nfind that the influence of this assumption is minimal at the scales of\nasymmetry observed in JWST observations of WASP-39 b (with a maximum asymmetry\nof 77%) but we show that it would become critical with greater levels of\nasymmetry (e.g. an average asymmetry of 80%). Furthermore, we stress the\nimportance of the shape of the asymmetric distribution and the difficulty in\nfitting this distribution from three summary statistics (the median and an\nupper and lower bound on the transit depth). An asymmetric likelihood sampler\nwill incorrectly predict parameters if the shape of the likelihood does not\nmatch that of the underlying noise distribution even when the levels of\nasymmetry are equal in both. Overall, we find that it is safe to use the\nGaussian likelihood assumption for current datasets but it is worth considering\nthe potential bias if greater asymmetries are observed.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a\nsubset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic\nanalysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential\nto enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying\nby defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each\naligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on\naccurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object\ncounting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on\nindexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide\naccurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,\nstate-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object\ncounts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this\nlimitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for\naccurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing\non accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding\nobject centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance\nwith a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling\nbetter handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To\nadapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model\nselection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each\ninput. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that\nCounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories,\nresulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.",

Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then\ncluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods\nincorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection.\nHowever, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve\nsegmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in\nwhether top-down clustering informs boundary selection.

While generative models offer a promising solution for\ndata synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize\nlesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In\nthis paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel\nframework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and\nlocalized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,\nwhere the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that\nrepresents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical\ncoherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize\nlesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that\nguides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most\nrelevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing\ntheir interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise\ncontrol over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of\nsynthesized mammograms.

This ensures\northogonality, locality, and the vanishing moments property with respect to\nproperly defined polynomial spaces on graphs. Compared to classical Haar\nwavelets, this framework broadens the class of graph signals that can\nefficiently be compressed and analyzed. Along this line, we provide a\ndefinition of a class of signals that can be compressed using our construction.\nWe support our findings with different examples of signals defined on graphs\nwhose vertices lie on smooth manifolds. For efficient numerical implementation,\nwe combine heavy edge clustering, to partition the graph into meaningful\npatches, with landmark \\texttt{Isomap}, which provides low-dimensional\nembeddings for each patch. Our results demonstrate the method's robustness,\nscalability, and ability to yield sparse representations with controllable\napproximation error, significantly outperforming traditional Haar wavelet\napproaches in terms of compression efficiency and multiresolution fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Cluster synchronization in multilayer networks of phase oscillators with\nphase-lag poses significant challenges due to the destabilizing effects of\ndelayed interactions. Leveraging the Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model, this study\naddresses these challenges by systematically exploring the role of natural\nfrequency distributions in sustaining cluster synchronization under high\nphase-lag conditions. We focus on four distributions: uniform (uni-uni),\npartially degree-correlated (deg-uni, uni-deg), and fully degree-correlated\n(deg-deg), where oscillators' intrinsic frequencies align with their network\nconnectivity. Through numerical and analytical investigations, we demonstrate\nthat the deg-deg distribution, where both layers employ degree-matched\nfrequencies, remarkably enhances synchronization stability, outperforming other\nconfigurations. We analyze two distinct network architectures: one composed\nentirely of nontrivial clusters and another combining trivial and nontrivial\nclusters. Results reveal that structural heterogeneity encoded in the deg-deg\ncoupling counteracts phase-lag-induced desynchronization, enabling robust\ncluster synchronization even at large phase-lag values. Stability is rigorously\nvalidated via transverse Lyapunov exponents (TLEs), which confirm that deg-deg\nnetworks exhibit broader synchronization regimes compared to uniform or\npartially correlated systems. These findings provide critical insights into the\ninterplay between topological heterogeneity and dynamical resilience, offering\na framework for designing robust multilayer systems from delay-tolerant power\ngrids to adaptive biological networks, where synchronization under phase-lag is\nparamount.",

In this problem, the goal is to remove some edges\nof an undirected graph with edge weights and edge costs, so as to increase the\nweight of a minimum spanning tree. In the budget minimization version, the goal\nis to minimize the total cost of the removed edges, while achieving a desired\nincrease $\\Delta$ in the weight of the minimum spanning tree. An alternative\nobjective within the same framework is to maximize the profit of interdiction,\nnamely the increase in the weight of the minimum spanning tree, subject to a\nbudget constraint. There are known polynomial time $O(1)$ approximation\nguarantees for a similar objective (maximizing the total cost of the tree,\nrather than the increase). However, the guarantee does not seem to apply to the\nincrease in cost. Moreover, the same techniques do not seem to apply to the\nbudget version.\n  Our approximation guarantees are motivated by studying the question of\nminimizing the cost of increasing the minimum spanning tree by any amount. We\nshow that in contrast to the budget and profit problems, this version of\ninterdiction is polynomial time-solvable, and we give an efficient algorithm\nfor solving it. The solution motivates a graph-theoretic relaxation of the\nNP-hard interdiction problem. The gain in minimum spanning tree weight, as a\nfunction of the set of removed edges, is super-modular.

    "abstract": "A recent trend in wireless communications considers the migration of\ntraditional monolithic base stations to the so-called disaggregated\narchitecture, where radio units (RUs) implement only the low-level physical\nlayer functionalities such as demodulation, and A/D conversion, while the\nhigh-level physical layer, such as channel decoding, is implemented as\nsoftware-defined functions running on general-purpose hardware in some remote\ncentral processing unit (CP). The corresponding information theoretic model for\nthe uplink (from the wireless users to the CP) is a multiaccess-relay channel\nwith primitive oblivious relays. The relays (RUs) are oblivious, as they are\nagnostic of the users codebooks, and primitive, since the fronthaul links (from\nRUs to CP) are error-free with limited capacity. This class of networks has\nbeen intensely studied in the information theoretic literature, where several\napproximated or exact (under certain conditions) capacity results have been\nderived. In particular, in the Gaussian case, the model has been analyzed for\nfixed and known channel state. This paper is motivated by the fact that, in\npractice, the channel state is a random process, and it is estimated at the\nbase station side through uplink pilot symbols sent by the users. The pilot\ndimension may take up a large portion of the channel coherence block, i.e., the\nnumber of symbols over which the channel state remains approximately constant.\nHence, sending both pilot and data symbols from the relays to the CP may\nrequire a significant overhead, especially when the fronthaul capacity is\nsmall. As a prototypical problem, we consider the ergodic achievable rate for a\ndiamond network formed by a single user and two relays where the channel state\nis known at the relays, but not known at the CP.",

One promising approach to address this issue is patch pruning,\nwhich improves computational efficiency by identifying and removing redundant\npatches. In this work, we propose a patch pruning strategy that evaluates the\nimportance of each patch based on the variance of attention weights across\nmultiple attention heads. This approach is inspired by the design of multi-head\nself-attention, which aims to capture diverse attention patterns across\ndifferent subspaces of feature representations. The proposed method can be\neasily applied during both training and inference, and achieves improved\nthroughput while maintaining classification accuracy in scenarios such as\nfine-tuning with pre-trained models. In addition, we also found that using\nrobust statistical measures, such as the median absolute deviation in place of\nvariance, to assess patch importance can similarly lead to strong performance.\nFurthermore, by introducing overlapping patch embeddings, our method achieves\nbetter performance with comparable throughput to conventional approaches that\nutilize all patches.",

Cough audio recordings were prospectively acquired from a total of\n227 subjects, divided into NSCLC patients and healthy controls.

To\nenhance the interpretability of the machine learning model, we utilized Shapley\nAdditive Explanations (SHAP). The fairness of the models across demographic\ngroups was assessed by comparing the performance of the best model across\ndifferent age groups (less than or equal to 58y and higher than 58y) and gender\nusing the equalized odds difference on the test set. The results demonstrate\nthat CNN achieves the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.83 on the test\nset. Nevertheless, SVM achieves slightly lower performances (accuracy of 0.76\nin validation and 0.78 in the test set), making it suitable in contexts with\nlow computational power. The use of SHAP for SVM interpretation further\nenhances model transparency, making it more trustworthy for clinical\napplications. Fairness analysis shows slightly higher disparity across age\n(0.15) than gender (0.09) on the test set.

    "abstract": "Turbulent flows, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit coherent\nstructures that underpin their dynamics. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)\nhas been widely used to extract these structures from experimental data. While\nperiodic features like vortex shedding can be identified using POD mode pairs\nwhen periodicity dominates the flow, detecting such structures in complex flows\nis more challenging. The Hilbert proper orthogonal decomposition (HPOD)\naddresses this by applying POD to the analytic signal of the turbulent\nfluctuations, yielding complex modes with a $90^\\circ$ phase shift between the\nreal and imaginary components. These modes capture propagating structures\neffectively but introduce filtering artefacts from the Hilbert transform that\nis used to derive the analytic signal. The current work investigates the\nrelationship between the modes of the POD and those of the HPOD on the velocity\nfluctuations in the wake of a sphere. By comparing their outputs, POD mode\npairs that correspond to the same propagating structures revealed by HPOD are\nidentified. Furthermore, this study explored whether computing the analytic\nsignal of the POD modes can replicate the HPOD modes, offering a more\ncomputationally efficient method for determining the pairs of POD modes that\nrepresent propagating structures. The results show that the pairs of POD modes\nidentified by the HPOD can be more efficiently determined using the Hilbert\ntransform directly on the POD modes. This method enhances the interpretive\npower of POD, enabling more detailed analysis of turbulent dynamics without\nintroducing the filtering from the Hilbert transform.",

In clinical practice, CMR acquisitions are frequently degraded by\nrespiratory motion, yet the robustness of deep learning models against such\nartifacts remains an underexplored problem. To promote research in this domain,\nwe organized the MICCAI CMRxMotion challenge. We curated and publicly released\na dataset of 320 CMR cine series from 40 healthy volunteers who performed\nspecific breathing protocols to induce a controlled spectrum of motion\nartifacts. The challenge comprised two tasks: 1) automated image quality\nassessment to classify images based on motion severity, and 2) robust\nmyocardial segmentation in the presence of motion artifacts. A total of 22\nalgorithms were submitted and evaluated on the two designated tasks. This paper\npresents a comprehensive overview of the challenge design and dataset, reports\nthe evaluation results for the top-performing methods, and further investigates\nthe impact of motion artifacts on five clinically relevant biomarkers.

By\nconceptually considering a group of voting agents to be intelligent matter, the\nimpact of real-time information on voting results is quantitatively studied by\nan intelligent Ising model, which is formed by adding nonlinear instantaneous\nfeedback of the overall magnetization to the conventional Ising model. In the\nnew model, the interaction strength becomes a variable depending on the total\nmagnetization rather than a constant, which mimics the scenario that the\ndecision of an individual during vote influenced by the dynamically changing\npolling result during the election process. Our analytical derivations along\nwith Mote Carlo simulations reveal that, with a positive feedback, the\nintelligent Ising model exhibits phase transitions at any finite temperatures,\na feature lacked in the conventional one-dimensional Ising model. In all\ndimensions, by varying the feedback strength, the system changes from going\nthrough a second-order phase transition to going through a first-order phase\ntransition with increasing temperature, and the two types of phase transitions\nare connected by a tricritical point. This study on the one hand demonstrates\nthat the intelligent matter with a nonlinear adaptive interaction can exhibit\nqualitatively different phase behaviors from conventional matter, and on the\nother hand shows that, during voting, even unbiased feedback may possibly\ninduce spontaneous symmetry breaking, leading to a biased outcome where one\nside of the vote becomes favored.",

With a focus on gender and\nprofessional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to\nungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a\nstructured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three\ndifferent professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a\nhierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive\ngrammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current\nLLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular\nLLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google\nGemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600\nresponses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate\nstereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she'\npronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in\nAI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in\nthe workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use.\nUnderstanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and\nassuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather\ncontribute to more equitable outcomes.

    "abstract": "Energy systems generate vast amounts of data in extremely short time\nintervals, creating challenges for efficient data management. Traditional data\nmanagement methods often struggle with scalability and accessibility, limiting\ntheir usefulness. More advanced solutions, such as NoSQL databases and\ncloud-based platforms, have been adopted to address these issues. Still, even\nthese advanced solutions can encounter bottlenecks, which can impact the\nefficiency of data storage, retrieval, and analysis. This review paper explores\nthe research trends in big data management for energy systems, highlighting the\npractices, opportunities and challenges.

Nevertheless, fine-grained MoE-based LLMs face several\nchallenges: 1) Variable workloads during runtime create arbitrary GEMV-GEMM\nratios that reduce hardware utilization, 2) Traditional MoE-based scheduling\nfor LLM serving cannot fuse attention operations with MoE operations, leading\nto increased latency and decreased hardware utilization, and 3) Despite being\nmore efficient than conventional LLMs, loading experts from DRAM still consumes\nsignificant energy and requires substantial DRAM bandwidth. Addressing these\nchallenges, we propose: 1) A3D-MoE, a 3D Heterogeneous Integration system that\nemploys state-of-the-art vertical integration technology to significantly\nenhance memory bandwidth while reducing Network-on-Chip (NoC) overhead and\nenergy consumption. 2) A 3D-Adaptive GEMV-GEMM-ratio systolic array with\nV-Cache efficient data reuse and a novel unified 3D dataflow to solve the\nproblem of reduced hardware utilization caused by arbitrary GEMV-GEMM ratios\nfrom different workloads, 3) A Hardware resource-aware operation fusion\nscheduler that fuses attention operations with MoE operations to enhance\nhardware performance, and 4) MoE Score-Aware HBM access reduction with even-odd\nexpert placement that reduces DRAM access and bandwidth requirements. Our\nevaluation results indicate that A3D-MoE delivers significant performance\nenhancements, reducing latency by a factor of 1.8x to 2x and energy consumption\nby 2x to 4x, while improving throughput by 1.44x to 1.8x compared to the\nstate-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the few-shot segmentation (FSS) task, which aims to\nsegment objects belonging to unseen categories in a query image by learning a\nmodel on a small number of well-annotated support samples. Our analysis of two\nmainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype\nlearning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning\nmethods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance\nthe conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS\nframeworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we\npropose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which\nintroduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention\nScore Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning\nmodel (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions\ngenerated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype\npredictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image\nrepresentations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG)\nrelationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of\nthe affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually\nincreasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results\nshow that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and\n5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, suggesting its\neffectiveness.

Each DARISA comprises a number of metasurface elements activated\nsimultaneously via a parallel feed network. The proposed system enables rapid\nand intelligent phase response adjustments for each metasurface element within\na single symbol duration, facilitating a dynamic agile adjustment of phase\nresponse (DAAPR) strategy. By analyzing the theoretical degrees of freedom\n(DoF) of the DARISA MIMO system under the DAAPR framework, we derive an\nexplicit relationship between DoF and critical system parameters, including\nagility frequentness (i.e., the number of phase adjustments of metasurface\nelements during one symbol period), cluster angular spread of wireless\nchannels, DARISA array size, and the number of transmit/receive DARISAs. The\nDoF result reveals a significant conclusion: when the number of receive DARISAs\nis smaller than that of transmit DARISAs, the DAAPR strategy of the DARISA MIMO\nenhances the overall system DoF. Furthermore, relying on DoF alone to measure\nchannel capacity is insufficient, so we analyze the effective DoF (EDoF) that\nreflects the impacts of the DoF and channel matrix singular value distribution\non capacity. We show channel capacity monotonically increases with EDoF, and\noptimize the agile phase responses of metasurface elements by using fractional\nprogramming (FP) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) algorithms to maximize the\nEDoF. Simulations validate the theoretical DoF gains and reveal that increasing\nagility frequentness, metasurface element density, and phase quantization\naccuracy can enhance the EDoF. Additionally, densely deployed elements can\ncompensate for the loss in communication performance caused by lower phase\nquantization accuracy.",

This effect can be described\nby joining shear bias and redshift characterisation in the effective redshift\ndistribution, $n_{\\gamma}(z)$, which includes the response of apparent shapes\nof detected objects to shear of galaxies at redshift $z$. In this work, we\npropose a novel method to correct $n_{\\gamma}(z)$ for redshift-mixed blending\nby emulating the shear response to neighbouring galaxies. Specifically, we\ndesign a ``half-sky-shearing'' simulation with HSC-Wide-like specifications, in\nwhich we extract the response of a detected object's measured ellipticity to\nshear of neighbouring galaxies among numerous galaxy pairs. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility of accurately emulating these pairwise responses and validate the\nrobustness of our approach under varying observing conditions and galaxy\npopulation uncertainties. We find that the effective redshift of sources at the\nhigh-redshift tail of the distribution is about 0.05 lower than expected when\nnot modelling the effect.

These asymmetries can arise\nat multiple levels: locally, in the dynamics of individual units, and globally,\nin the topology of their interactions. In this work, we investigate how these\ntwo forms of non-reciprocity interact in networks of neuronal populations. At\nthe local level, each population is modeled by a non-reciprocally coupled set\nof excitatory and inhibitory neural populations exhibiting transient\namplification and reactivity. At the network level, these populations are\ncoupled via directed, asymmetric connections that introduce structural\nnon-normality. Since non-reciprocal interactions generically lead to non-normal\nlinear operators, we frame both local and global asymmetries in terms of\nnon-normal dynamics. Using a modified Wilson-Cowan framework, we analyze how\nthe interplay between these two types of non-normality shapes the system's\nbehavior. We show that their combination leads to emergent collective dynamics,\nincluding fluctuation-driven transitions, dimensionality reduction, and novel\nnonequilibrium steady states. Our results provide a minimal yet flexible\nframework to understand how multi-scale non-reciprocities govern complex\ndynamics in neural and other interconnected systems.",

While the governing physics\ncan be well described by the Navier-Stokes equations, practical prediction\nefforts often fall short due to the lack of comprehensive models for\nperturbation initialization and turbulence generation in numerical simulations.\nTo address the uncertainty introduced by unforeseeable environmental\nperturbations, we propose a fine-grained predictive framework that accurately\npredicts the transition location.

In this company,\nrequirements are specified using a Functional Design Specification (FDS), a\ndocument that outlines the functional requirements and features of a system,\napplication, or process. We provide LLMs with a summary of the requirements\nelicitation documents and FDS templates, prompting them to generate Epic FDS\n(including high-level product descriptions) and user stories, which are\nsubsequently compiled into a complete FDS document. We compared the correctness\nand quality of the FDS generated by three state-of-the-art LLMs against those\nproduced by human analysts. Our results show that LLMs can help automate and\nstandardize the requirements specification, reducing time and human effort.\nHowever, the quality of LLM-generated FDS highly depends on inputs and often\nrequires human revision. Thus, we advocate for a synergistic approach in which\nan LLM serves as an effective drafting tool while human analysts provide the\ncritical contextual and technical oversight necessary for high-quality\nrequirements engineering (RE) documentation.",

In contrast to the commonly-used phase-field approach,\nthis proposed approach for investigating fracture paths does not require a\nspecified `length-scale' parameter defining the diffuse interface region nor a\nlevel set function. Instead, it interprets the fracture as part of the boundary\nof the domain and uses shape optimization algorithms to minimize the energy in\nthe system and therefore describes the fracture propagation directly. Embedding\nthe problem of energy minimization in a Riemannian manifold framework\nformulated on a suitable shape space, together with the choice of an outer\nRiemannian metric, yields both advantages from an analytical as well as an\napplied perspective. Furthermore, an eigenvalue decomposition of the strain\ntensor is used to produce more realistic fracture paths (the so-called strain\nsplitting), which only allows fracture growth from tensile loads. Numerical\nsimulations for the commonly considered single-edge notch tension and shear\ntest are performed and the results are evaluated in comparison to phase-field\nresults.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic low altitude networks offer significant potential for efficient and\nreliable data transport via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) relays which\nusually operate with predetermined trajectories. However, it is challenging to\noptimize the data routing and resource allocation due to the time-varying\ntopology and the need to control interference with terrestrial systems.\nTraditional schemes rely on time-expanded graphs with uniform and fine time\nsubdivisions, making them impractical for interference-aware applications. This\npaper develops a dynamic space-time graph model with a cross-layer optimization\nframework that converts a joint routing and predictive resource allocation\nproblem into a joint bottleneck path planning and resource allocation problem.\nWe develop explicit deterministic bounds to handle the channel uncertainty and\nprove a monotonicity property in the problem structure that enables us to\nefficiently reach the globally optimal solution to the predictive resource\nallocation subproblem. Then, this approach is extended to multi-commodity\ntransmission tasks through time-frequency allocation, and a bisection search\nalgorithm is developed to find the optimum solution by leveraging the\nmonotonicity of the feasible set family. Simulations verify that the\nsingle-commodity algorithm approaches global optimality with more than 30 dB\nperformance gain over the classical graph-based methods for delay-sensitive and\nlarge data transportation. At the same time, the multi-commodity method\nachieves 100X improvements in dense service scenarios and enables an additional\n20 dB performance gain by data segmenting.",

Harsha,\nMitropolsky and Rosen [ITCS, 2023] initiated the study of downward self\nreductions in the case of search problems.

Despite empirical\nevidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high\ncomputational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of\npassages evaluated.

In two separate empirical investigations we demonstrate that there is\nempirical support for the new forms of fixed effects and that the results can\ndiffer significantly from those obtained using traditional fixed effects\nestimators.",

First, we instate the role of LLMs as optimizers, outlining\nembedding techniques for IEs, and introducing two core applications of iPLAN:\n(i) IWN planning based on pre-existing IEs and (ii) joint design of IWN and IE\nfor new wireless-friendly buildings.

    "abstract": "In meteor science, the identification of meteor showers is a crucial and\ncomplex problem. The most common method is to perform a systematic search of a\ndatabase of observed orbits using an orbit dissimilarity criterion\n(D-criterion) and an algorithm. D-criteria compare the result of an orbit\ndissimilarity function (D-function) and a threshold. These D-functions\nassociate one value to two meteoroids orbits. If this value is lower than the\nthreshold, the meteoroids' orbits are considered similar. Group of meteors are\nthus formed. However, not all D-criteria have been evaluated, and their high\nnumber makes it hard to know which should be prioritised. This paper presents a\nreview of each D-function, the tests they passed, the threshold choice, and the\nalgorithms they are used with. We show what methods are currently used in the\nsearch for meteor showers, presenting statistics based on papers justifying the\nexistence of established meteor showers. We review D-functions from eight\ndifferent papers. We describe how thresholds and clustering algorithms are\nusually chosen. We also analyse tests that were performed on D-criteria. We\ndiscover that most of those criteria were not properly tested, and that some\nhave been criticised for their theoretical background. Thus, we recommend\nperforming a post-search analysis of the groups found, both in a statistical\nsense (to make sure the groups formed could not have been formed randomly) and\nan orbital dynamics sense (to check whether the group could indeed come from a\nsingular parent body), to present the findings as potential meteor showers.",

Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is\nproposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of\npulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the\nin-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the\nsemi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of\nlabeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher\nmodel is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which\nreliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the\nstudent model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is\niteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:\nExtensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD\npatients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by\n2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is\nconducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the\ndifferences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.\nConclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of\npulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis.

The paper explores these links to identify ways to reduce\ninfrastructural and socio-political complexities, and to move away from the\nreductionist paradigm, in order to support digital degrowth. Its development\nshows that complexity induces ratchet effects (i.e. irreversibilities in the\ndevelopment of a technique in a society), rendering degrowth efforts difficult\nto handle by individuals.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems, especially those based on graph neural networks (GNNs),\nhave achieved remarkable success in capturing user-item interaction patterns.\nHowever, they remain susceptible to popularity bias--the tendency to\nover-recommend popular items--resulting in reduced content diversity and\ncompromised fairness. In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel\nregularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in\ngraph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional\ntraining objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items,\nthereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more\npersonalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive\n(PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the\ncontribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We\nfurther explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed\npopularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach\nflexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be\nseamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as\nLightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as\ndemonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU)\nand Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even\nenhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics. These results\nhighlight the effectiveness of directly embedding fairness objectives into the\noptimization process, providing a practical and scalable solution for balancing\naccuracy and equitable content exposure in modern recommender systems.",

OmniGSE bridges this gap by integrating the\nstrengths of discriminative and generative approaches through a two-stage\narchitecture that enables cross-domain collaborative optimization. In the first\nstage, continuous features are enhanced using a lightweight channel-split\nNAC-RoFormer. In the second stage, discrete tokens are generated to reconstruct\nhigh-quality speech through language models.

However, they also present significant control challenges: their\nlarge, lightweight structures are highly sensitive to environmental\ndisturbances, and conventional aerodynamic control surfaces lose effectiveness\nduring low-speed or hover flight. The objective of this thesis is to develop a\nrobust control strategy tailored to a vectored-thrust airship equipped with\ntiltable propellers. The proposed approach is based on an Extended Incremental\nNonlinear Dynamic Inversion inner loop in combination with a high level outer\nloop, controlling the attitude and velocity of the airship. The proposed method\nis able to effectively control the airship over the whole envelope, including\nhover and high speed flight. For this, effective use of available actuators is\nkey. This includes especially the tilt rotors, for which a control allocation\nmethod is presented. The controller's performance is validated through a series\nof simulation-based test scenarios, including aggressive maneuvering, gust\nrejection, atmospheric turbulence, and significant parameter mismatches. The\ncontroller is compared against an alternative controller developed at the\ninstitute, offering insight into the trade-offs between direct inversion and\nincremental control approaches. Results demonstrate that the proposed E-INDI\ncontroller achieves very good tracking performance and high high robustness\nagainst parameter uncertainties.",

The\nresults show that the proposed method reduces the computational efforts while\nlosing some throughput optimality compared to the centralized method.\nFurthermore, the case study illustrates that incorporating risk assessment into\nrescheduling decision-making improves the throughput.",

    "abstract": "We present a spatial and spectral analysis of arcsecond-scale X-ray emission\nin SS 433 using zeroth-order data from Chandra High-Energy Transmission Grating\n(HETG) observations. The analysis is based on 24 observations acquired between\n1999 and 2024, comprising a total exposure of $\\sim$850 ks and covering a wide\nrange of orbital and precessional phases. Among these, the $\\sim$140 ks\nobservation from 2014 was analyzed in detail for this study. This data provides\nthe best statistics and was taken when the jets were nearly perpendicular to\nthe line of sight and the accretion disk was eclipsed. By applying an\nenergy-dependent subpixel event repositioning algorithm and the Richardson-Lucy\ndeconvolution, we enhanced the spatial resolution and revealed eastern and\nwestern knot-like structures at a distance of $\\sim$1.7 arcsec ($\\sim 10^{17}$\ncm) from the core. These features are consistent with the kinematic precession\nmodel, and the positions of the knots suggest that they were ejected\napproximately 200 days prior to the observation. A comparison with VLA radio\ndata obtained at a similar precessional phase shows that the X-ray emission\nextends east-west on a scale comparable to that of the radio emission. While\nthe core is bright in both X-rays and radio, the brightness contrast between\nthe knots and the core is smaller in X-rays than in radio. Spatially resolved\nspectroscopy indicates that prominent Fe lines in the core X-ray spectrum are\nwell explained by thermal plasma emission. In contrast, Fe lines are not\nevident in the outer regions after accounting for potential core contamination,\nsuggesting a dominant contribution from non-thermal processes. These findings\nimply that the arcsecond-scale X-ray structures may vary observationally with\nviewing conditions or precessional phase, but likely reflect a relatively\nstable jet-driving mechanism operating within the SS 433 system.",

Materials\nand Methods: From May to September 2024, radiologists were invited to\ncontribute fictional radiology reports following their standard reporting\npractices. Contributors provided at least 20 reports with associated metadata\nincluding anatomical region, imaging modality, clinical context, and for\nnon-English reports, English translations. All reports were assigned ICD-10\ncodes. A human vs. AI report differentiation study was conducted with 154\nparticipants (radiologists, healthcare professionals, and non-healthcare\nprofessionals) assessing whether reports were human-authored or AI-generated.\nResults: The dataset comprises 2,658 radiology reports from 76 authors across\n21 countries and 13 languages. Reports cover multiple imaging modalities (CT:\n36.1%, MRI: 22.8%, radiography: 19.0%, ultrasound: 16.8%) and anatomical\nregions, with chest (19.9%), abdomen (18.6%), head (17.3%), and pelvis (14.1%)\nbeing most prevalent. In the differentiation study, participants achieved 53.9%\naccuracy (95% CI: 50.7%-57.1%) in distinguishing between human and AI-generated\nreports, with radiologists performing significantly better (56.9%, 95% CI:\n53.3%-60.6%, p<0.05) than other groups. Conclusion: PARROT represents the\nlargest open multilingual radiology report dataset, enabling development and\nvalidation of natural language processing applications across linguistic,\ngeographic, and clinical boundaries without privacy constraints.",

The proposed methodology was developed and implemented in Lower\nAustria, with a particular focus on the small towns that are characteristic of\na region lacking major urban centres. Through semi-structured interviews and\ncollaborative workshops (e.g. a needs requirements workshop) with various\nrelevant stakeholders, fifteen possible use cases were first identified. Then\nthese use cases were categorised and assessed based on criteria such as\nfeasibility, usefulness, the need for biological or human modelling, and\noverall complexity. Based on these characteristics, three use cases were\nselected for further development. These will be the basis of digital twin\nsolutions for supporting decision-making and public outreach regarding policy\ndecisions in those fields. Our proposed methodology emphasises stakeholder\nengagement to ensure robust data collection and alignment with practical\nrequirements and the involved towns' current needs. We thus provide a\nreplicable framework for researchers and practitioners aiming to implement\ndigital twin tools in future smart city initiatives in non-urban and rural\ncontexts.",

A significant effort has\nbeen made to develop these agile disruption mitigation approaches, leveraging\nboth centralized and distributed decision-making strategies. Though trade-offs\nof centralized and distributed approaches have been analyzed in existing\nstudies, no related work has been found on understanding supply chain\nperformance based on the network attributes of the disrupted supply chain\nentities.

The\nperformance of the distributed framework is evaluated through a comprehensive\ncase study that investigates the performance of the supply chain as a function\nof the network structure and agent attributes within the network in the\npresence of a disruption. Comparison to a centralized decision-making approach\nhighlights trade-offs between performance, computation time, and network\ncommunication based on the decision-making strategy and network architecture.\nPractitioners can use the outcomes of our studies to design response strategies\nbased on agent capabilities, network attributes, and desired supply chain\nperformance.",

Through experiments on\nsynthetic and real-world data, we find that (1) harnessing more modalities\nusually improves ASR accuracy, as each modality provides complementary\ninformation, but the improvement depends on the amount of auditory noise.

This results in a dispersion relation that opens up for 3-wave\ninteractions, also known as wave triads.\n  Here, we report the observation of high-frequency spectral peaks in the power\nspectral density of waves in ice spectra. We show, in two timeseries datasets,\nthat the presence of these high-frequency peaks is accompanied by high values\nfor the spectral bicoherence. This is a signature that the high-frequency peak\nis phase-locked with frequency components in the main spectral energy peak, and\na necessary condition for nonlinear coupling to take place. Moreover, we show\nfor a timeseries dataset that includes several closely located sensors that the\ndispersion relation recovered from a cross-spectrum analysis is compatible with\nthe possible existence of wave triads at the same frequencies for which the\nbicoherence peak is observed. In addition to these observations in timeseries\ndatasets, we show that similar high-frequency peaks are observed from\nadditional, independent datasets of waves in ice power spectrum densities\ntransmitted over iridium from autonomous buoys.\n  These results suggest that nonlinear energy transfers between wave in ice\nspectral components are likely to occur in some waves and sea ice conditions.\nThis may enable redistribution of energy from weakly damped low-frequency waves\nto more strongly attenuated higher-frequency spectral components, which can\ncontribute to energy dissipation in the ice.",

    "abstract": "Existing retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) methods typically use an\nexternal retrieval module to fetch semantically similar code snippets used for\ngenerating subsequent fragments. However, even for consecutive code fragments,\nthe content often diverges due to logical progression, resulting in a content\ngap. This gap undermines the performance of current RACG methods, as\n\\textit{external} retrieval modules based on content matching fail to infer the\nspecific information need of LLMs to generate the next code fragment.\nTherefore, we propose \\textbf{SelfRACG}, a novel paradigm that enables large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to \\textbf{Self}-express their information needs to\nenhance \\textbf{RACG}. Specifically, SelfRACG includes an information need\nexpression module and a two-stage information need-guided training strategy,\nwhich encourages LLMs to express their information need. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that SelfRACG can retrieve external knowledge that better aligns\nwith the LLM's own information needs, resulting in superior generation\nperformance compared to vanilla RACG.",

In this work, we show how to\ncopy-protect even a larger class of schemes. We define a class of cryptographic\nschemes called malleable-puncturable schemes where the only requirement is that\none can create a circuit that is capable of answering inputs at points that are\nunrelated to the challenge in the security game but does not help the adversary\nanswer inputs related to the challenge. This is a flexible generalization of\npuncturable schemes, and can capture a wide range of primitives that was not\nknown how to copy-protect prior to our work. Going further, we show that our\nscheme is secure against arbitrary high min-entropy challenge distributions\nwhereas previous work has only considered schemes that are punctured at\npseudorandom points.",

However, existing G2M\nmethods are limited by their inability to flexibly adjust inference cost and\naccuracy dynamically, a critical requirement for real-world applications where\ncomputational resources and time constraints can vary significantly. To address\nthis, we introduce a Progressive framework designed to offer flexible and\non-demand trade-offs between inference cost and accuracy for GNN-to-MLP\nknowledge distillation (ProGMLP). ProGMLP employs a Progressive Training\nStructure (PTS), where multiple MLP students are trained in sequence, each\nbuilding on the previous one. Furthermore, ProGMLP incorporates Progressive\nKnowledge Distillation (PKD) to iteratively refine the distillation process\nfrom GNNs to MLPs, and Progressive Mixup Augmentation (PMA) to enhance\ngeneralization by progressively generating harder mixed samples. Our approach\nis validated through comprehensive experiments on eight real-world graph\ndatasets, demonstrating that ProGMLP maintains high accuracy while dynamically\nadapting to varying runtime scenarios, making it highly effective for\ndeployment in diverse application settings.",

Provide evidence whether using LLMs in title-abstract screening in\nsoftware engineering is advisable. Method: We start with 169 SR research\nartifacts and find 24 of those to be suitable for inclusion in the dataset.\nUsing the dataset we benchmark title-abstract screening using 9 LLMs. Results:\nWe present the SESR-Eval (Software Engineering Systematic Review Evaluation)\ndataset containing 34,528 labeled primary studies, sourced from 24 secondary\nstudies published in software engineering (SE) journals. Most LLMs performed\nsimilarly and the differences in screening accuracy between secondary studies\nare greater than differences between LLMs. The cost of using an LLM is\nrelatively low - less than $40 per secondary study even for the most expensive\nmodel. Conclusions: Our benchmark enables monitoring AI performance in the\nscreening task of SRs in software engineering. At present, LLMs are not yet\nrecommended for automating the title-abstract screening process, since accuracy\nvaries widely across secondary studies, and no LLM managed a high recall with\nreasonable precision.

Prior work has primarily focused on constructing exact $k$-uniform\nstates or proving their nonexistence. However, due to inevitable theoretical\napproximations and experimental imperfections, generating exact $k$-uniform\nstates is neither feasible nor necessary in practice. In this work, we initiate\nthe study of approximate $k$-uniform states, demonstrating that they are\nlocally indistinguishable from their exact counterparts unless massive\nmeasurements are performed. We prove that such states can be constructed with\nhigh probability from the Haar-random ensemble and, more efficiently, via\nshallow random quantum circuits. Furthermore, we establish a connection between\napproximate $k$-uniform states and approximate QECCs, showing that Haar random\nconstructions yield high-performance codes with linear rates, vanishing\nproximity, and exponentially small failure probability while random circuits\ncan't construct codes with linear code rate in shallow depth. Finally, we\ninvestigate the relationship between approximate QECCs and approximate quantum\ninformation masking. Our work lays the foundation for the practical application\nof $k$-uniform states.",

Popular RL algorithms utilize multiple workers and can be\nmodeled as a graph, where each node is the status of a worker and each edge\nrepresents dataflow between nodes. Owing to the heavy cross-node dependencies,\nthe RL training system usually suffers from poor cluster scalability and low\nmemory utilization. In this article, we introduce MindSpeed RL, an effective\nand efficient system for large-scale RL training. Unlike existing centralized\nmethods, MindSpeed RL organizes the essential data dependencies in RL training,\ni.e., sample flow and resharding flow, from a distributed view. On the one\nhand, a distributed transfer dock strategy, which sets controllers and\nwarehouses on the basis of the conventional replay buffer, is designed to\nrelease the dispatch overhead in the sample flow. A practical allgather--swap\nstrategy is presented to eliminate redundant memory usage in resharding flow.\nIn addition, MindSpeed RL further integrates numerous parallelization\nstrategies and acceleration techniques for systematic optimization. Compared\nwith existing state-of-the-art systems, comprehensive experiments on the RL\ntraining of popular Qwen2.5-Dense-7B/32B, Qwen3-MoE-30B, and\nDeepSeek-R1-MoE-671B show that MindSpeed RL increases the throughput by 1.42 ~\n3.97 times.

In this paper, we take a first step\ntowards using ACL2s to reason about Python code by developing an embedding of a\nsubset of the Python type system in ACL2s. The subset of Python types we\nsupport includes many of the most commonly used type annotations as well as\nuser-defined types comprised of supported types. We provide ACL2s definitions\nof these types, as well as defdata enumerators that are customized to provide\ncode coverage and identify errors in Python programs. Using the ACL2s\nembedding, we can generate instances of types that can then be used as inputs\nto fuzz Python programs, which allows us to identify bugs in Python code that\nare not detected by state-of-the-art Python type checkers. We evaluate our work\nagainst four open-source repositories, extracting their type information and\ngenerating inputs for fuzzing functions with type signatures that are in the\nsupported subset of Python types. Note that we only use the type signatures of\nfunctions to generate inputs and treat the bodies of functions as black boxes.\nWe measure code coverage, which ranges from about 68% to more than 80%, and\nidentify code patterns that hinder coverage such as complex branch conditions\nand external file system dependencies.

Lisp-Z3\nis usable by anyone who would like to interact with Z3 from Common Lisp, as it\ndoes not depend on the availability of ACL2/s. We discuss the use of Lisp-Z3 in\nthree applications. The first is a Sudoku solver. The second is SeqSolve, a\nstring solver which solved a larger number of benchmark problems more quickly\nthan any other existing solver at the time of its publishing. Finally, Lisp-Z3\nwas also used in the context of hardware-in-the-loop fuzzing of wireless\nrouters, where low latency was an important goal.

Accurately predicting the specific mechanisms underlying DDIs\n(named DDI events or DDIEs) is critical for the safe clinical use of drugs.\nDDIEs are typically represented as textual descriptions. However, most\ncomputational methods focus more on predicting the DDIE class label over\ngenerating human-readable natural language increasing clinicians'\ninterpretation costs. Furthermore, current methods overlook the fact that each\ndrug assumes distinct biological functions in a DDI, which, when used as input\ncontext, can enhance the understanding of the DDIE process and benefit DDIE\ngeneration by the language model (LM). In this work, we propose a novel\npairwise knowledge-augmented generative method (termed PKAG-DDI) for DDIE text\ngeneration. It consists of a pairwise knowledge selector efficiently injecting\nstructural information between drugs bidirectionally and simultaneously to\nselect pairwise biological functions from the knowledge set, and a pairwise\nknowledge integration strategy that matches and integrates the selected\nbiological functions into the LM.

This study reveals\nthat human preference reward models fine-tuned based on CLIP and BLIP\narchitectures have inherent flaws: they inappropriately assign low scores to\nimages with rich details and high aesthetic value, creating a significant\ndiscrepancy with actual human aesthetic preferences. To address this issue, we\ndesign a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that\nachieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the\ndegree to which images represent textual content.

To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point\ncloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,\ndue to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,\nthese methods fail to work in various real-world domains.

We evaluate the conservative\nagent-based algorithm on continuous control tasks, and empirical results\ndemonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing baseline algorithms in\nterms of asymptotic performance and sample efficiency.",

By inverting the surrogate model,\nGENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize\npower consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.\nExtensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently\nmore sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards\noptimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis\noptimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.\nNotably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%\nswitching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads\ncompared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the\nversatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite\nState Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of\nlogic functions.

    "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) completion models traditionally assume access\nto the entire graph during training. This overlooks challenges stemming from\nthe evolving nature of TKGs, such as: (i) the model's requirement to generalize\nand assimilate new knowledge, and (ii) the task of managing new or unseen\nentities that often have sparse connections. In this paper, we present an\nincremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to\naddress entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse\nconnections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a\nweighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing\nTKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global\ndefinition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood\nproximity of GNN-based methods. The weighted sampling strategy employed in\ntraining accentuates edges linked to infrequently occurring entities. We\nevaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our\nframework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link\nprediction, and in addressing long-tail entities. Notably, our method achieves\na 10\\% improvement and a 15\\% boost in MRR for these datasets. The results\nunderscore the potential of our approach in mitigating catastrophic forgetting\nand enhancing the robustness of TKG completion methods, especially in an\nincremental training context",

Here, we present a machine learning (ML) tool using an\nensemble of neural networks (NNs) to predict cross sections to construct a\ndatabase of rate coefficients for rotationally inelastic transitions in\ncollisions of complex molecules such as water.

We\nexamine various architectures of data corresponding to each collision energy,\nsymmetry of water molecule, and excitation/de-excitation rotational\ntransitions, and optimize the training/validation data sets. Using only about\n10\\% of the computed data for training, the NNs predict cross sections of\nstate-to-state rotational transitions of H$_{2}$O + H$_{2}$O collision with\naverage relative root mean square error of 0.409.

Prior\ntool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a\nsingle tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math\nreasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with\nmore complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps.\nTo address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool\nAGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG\nguides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It\nthen aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning\nprocess, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a\nfinetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any\nLLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally\nexpensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned\nwith custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks:\nMATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench.

Time series capture the behavior of many\nlarge-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities.\nUsers often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or\nsuperposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and\npatterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when\ncovering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small\nmultiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that\nsummarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into\na set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar\nsubsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a\nvisual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer\nsmall multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar\nsubsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an\ninteractive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in\nreal-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts\nclear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a\nsignificant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering.

    "abstract": "The end-to-end dynamics of the smallest energized Criegee intermediate,\nH$_2$COO, was characterized for vibrational excitation close to and a few\nkcal/mol above the barrier for hydrogen transfer. From an aggregate of at least\n5 $\\mu$s of molecular dynamics simulations using a neural\nnetwork-representation of CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ reference data, the branching\nratios into molecular products HCO+OH, CO$_2$+H$_2$, or H$_2$O+CO was\nquantitatively determined. Consistent with earlier calculations and recent\nexperiments, decay into HCO+OH was found to be rare $(\\sim 2 \\%)$ whereas the\nother two molecular product channels are accessed with fractions of $\\sim 30\n\\%$ and $\\sim 20 \\%$, respectively. On the 1 ns time scale, which was the\nlength of an individual MD simulation, more than 40 \\% of the systems remain in\nthe reactant state due to partial intramolecular vibrational redistribution\n(IVR). Formation of CO$_2$+H$_2$ occurs through a bifurcating pathway, one of\nwhich passes through formic acid whereas the more probable route connects the\ndi-radical OCH$_2$O with the product through a low-lying transition state.\nNotably, none of the intermediates along the pathway accumulate and their\nmaximum concentration always remains well below 5 \\%. This work demonstrates\nthat atomistic simulations with global reactive machine-learned energy\nfunctions provide a quantitative understanding of the chemistry and reaction\ndynamics for atmospheric reactions in the gas phase.",

In these settings, networks are modeled as\ngraphs, with agents as nodes, agent pairs as edges, and edge weights capturing\npairwise production or interaction outcomes. This paper develops an adaptive,\nor \\textit{online}, policy that learns to form increasingly effective networks\nas data accumulates over time, progressively improving total network output\nmeasured by the sum of edge weights.\n  Our approach builds on the weighted stochastic block model (WSBM), which\ncaptures agents' unobservable heterogeneity through discrete latent types and\nmodels their complementarities in a flexible, nonparametric manner. We frame\nthe online network formation problem as a non-standard \\textit{batched\nmulti-armed bandit}, where each type pair corresponds to an arm, and pairwise\nreward depends on type complementarity. This strikes a balance between\nexploration -- learning latent types and complementarities -- and exploitation\n-- forming high-weighted networks. We establish two key results: a\n\\textit{batched local asymptotic normality} result for the WSBM and an\nasymptotic equivalence between maximum likelihood and variational estimates of\nthe intractable likelihood. Together, they provide a theoretical foundation for\ntreating variational estimates as normal signals, enabling principled Bayesian\nupdating across batches. The resulting posteriors are then incorporated into a\ntailored maximum-weight matching problem to determine the policy for the next\nbatch.

It bypasses the need for explicit\ndependency graph construction and achieving superior slicing accuracy.\nConcretely, SliceMate integrates three specialized agents: (1) a synthesis\nagent that produces candidate slices by incrementally expanding the scan scope\nacross functions and files guided by LLM-inferred dependencies; (2) a\nverification agent that performs conciseness and completeness checks of the\ncandidate slices, detecting missing or irrelevant statements; and (3) a\nrefinement agent that repairs the slices with minimal edits in accordance with\nthe verification results. These agents are orchestrated by a control module\nthat ensures timely convergence and outputs high-quality slices without manual\nintervention. For rigorous evaluation, we construct a new and high-quality\nbenchmark, SliceBench, comprising 2,200 manually annotated Java and Python\nprograms, with program lengths ranging from 5 to 8,577 lines, significantly\nlarger than those in existing slicing benchmarks.

Quantum error\ncorrection (QEC) protocols are being developed to overcome hardware noise, but\ntheir extremely high spacetime overheads, mainly due to magic state\ndistillation, make them infeasible for near-term practical implementation. This\nwork proposes the idea of partial quantum error correction (QEC) for quantum\nmachine learning (QML) models and identifies a sweet spot where distillations\nare omitted to significantly reduce overhead. By assuming error-corrected\ntwo-qubit CNOTs (Clifford operations), we demonstrate that the QML models\nremain trainable even when single-qubit gates are subjected to $\\approx0.2\\%$\ndepolarizing noise, corresponding to a gate error rate of $\\approx0.13\\%$ under\nrandomized benchmarking. Further analysis based on various noise models, such\nas phase-damping and thermal-dissipation channels at low temperature, indicates\nthat the QML models are trainable independent of the mean angle of\nover-rotation, or can even be improved by thermal damping that purifies a\nquantum state away from depolarizations.

    "abstract": "Legal document summarization represents a significant advancement towards\nimproving judicial efficiency through the automation of key information\ndetection. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing\ntechniques to meticulously identify and extract essential data from extensive\nlegal texts, which facilitates a more efficient review process. By employing\nadvanced machine learning algorithms, the framework recognizes underlying\npatterns within judicial documents to create precise summaries that encapsulate\nthe crucial elements. This automation alleviates the burden on legal\nprofessionals, concurrently reducing the likelihood of overlooking vital\ninformation that could lead to errors. Through comprehensive experiments\nconducted with actual legal datasets, we demonstrate the capability of our\nmethod to generate high-quality summaries while preserving the integrity of the\noriginal content and enhancing processing times considerably. The results\nreveal marked improvements in operational efficiency, allowing legal\npractitioners to direct their efforts toward critical analytical and\ndecision-making activities instead of manual reviews.

We show analytically\nthat this universal behavior can be traced back to how systems that can be\nmapped onto a dissipative linear parametric oscillator (DLPO) satisfy the\nadiabatic-impulse (AI) approximation, evinced by the divergence of the\nrelaxation time of the DLPO near a critical point. We verify our predictions in\nboth the classical and quantum regimes by considering two systems: the\nSine-Gordon model, which is a paradigmatic system for emulating classical DTCs;\nand the open Dicke lattice model, an array of spin-boson systems subjected to\nquantum fluctuations. For both systems, the DTCs can be tuned from a\nferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic order by varying the driving frequency,\nthus allowing us to test the validity of KZM for arbitrary spatiotemporal\nordering.",

This study evaluates the reliability and validity of a novel\nBalance Mat (BM) device, a low-cost portable alternative that uses optical\nfibre technology. The research includes two studies: a robot study and a human\nstudy. In the robot study, a UR10 robotic arm was used to obtain controlled\nsway patterns to assess the reliability and sensitivity of the BM. In the human\nstudy, 51 healthy young participants performed balance tasks on the BM in\ncombination with an FP to evaluate the BM's validity. Sway metrics such as sway\nmean, sway absolute mean, sway root mean square (RMS), sway path, sway range,\nand sway velocity were calculated from both BM and FP and compared. Reliability\nwas evaluated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), where values\ngreater than 0.9 were considered excellent and values between 0.75 and 0.9 were\nconsidered good. Results from the robot study demonstrated good to excellent\nICC values in both single and double-leg stances. The human study showed\nmoderate to strong correlations for sway path and range. Using Bland-Altman\nplots for agreement analysis revealed proportional bias between the BM and the\nFP where the BM overestimated sway metrics compared to the FP.

The device demonstrated\nconsistent sway measurement across varied stance conditions, establishing both\nreliability and validity following appropriate calibration.",

    "abstract": "The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in\nnatural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for\nhealthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules,\nnecessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover,\nexisting architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial\nLLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the\ncollaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster\ncollaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency\nmaximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For\nthe self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs\nwithin an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with\nhigh self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For\nthe cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the\nLLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask\nout the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the\npotential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive\nexperiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented\nspecialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up\nto the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially\nachieving ACC of 65.47\\% compared to the 56.12\\% achieved by GPT-4 on the\nObstetrics and Gynecology discipline.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a method that integrates convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) with ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, enabling\nsurface temperature forecasting at lead times beyond the short-range (five-day)\nforecast period. Owing to limited computational resources, operational\nmedium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models,\nwhich are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations,\nthe proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based\npost-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble\nmember, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution\nmodel outputs. Second, it reduces random errors through ensemble averaging of\nthe CNN-corrected members. This study also investigates whether the sequence of\nCNN correction and ensemble averaging affects the forecast accuracy. For\ncomparison with the proposed method, we additionally conducted experiments with\nthe CNN trained on ensemble-averaged forecasts. The first approach--CNN\ncorrection before ensemble averaging--consistently achieved higher accuracy\nthan the reverse approach. Although based on low-resolution ensemble forecasts,\nthe proposed method notably outperformed the high-resolution deterministic NWP\nmodels. These findings indicate that combining CNN-based correction with\nensemble averaging effectively reduces both the systematic and random errors in\nNWP model outputs.

We address this problem for the technologically vital Fe-Cr-C\nsystem by constructing two deep machine learning potentials in DeePMD\nrealization: one trained on non-magnetic DFT data (DP-NM) and one on\nspin-polarised DFT data (DP-M). Extensive validation against experiments\nreveals a striking dichotomy. The dynamic, collective properties, viscosity and\nmelting temperatures are reproduced accurately by DP-NM but are incorrectly\nestimated by DP-M. Static, local properties, density, and lattice parameters\nare captured excellently by DP-M, especially in Fe-rich alloys, whereas DP-NM\nfails. This behaviour is explained by general properties of paramagnetic state:\nat high temperature, local magnetic moments self-average in space and time, so\ntheir explicit treatment is unnecessary for transport properties but essential\nfor equilibrium volumes. Exploiting this insight, we show that a\ntransfer-learning protocol, pre-training on non-magnetic DFT and fine-tuning on\na small set of spin-polarised data, reduces the computational cost to develop\nmagnetic MLIPs by more than an order of magnitude. Developing general-purpose\npotentials that capture static and dynamic behaviors throughout the whole\ncomposition space requires proper accounting for temperature-induced spin\nfluctuations in DFT calculations and correctly incorporating spin degrees of\nfreedom into classical force fields.",

    "abstract": "Object detection (OD) in infrared (IR) imagery is critical for low-light and\nnighttime applications. However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces\nmodels to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR\nimproves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts\ndue to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we\nintroduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD)\nbenchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally,\nto fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained\nmodels, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants:\nWiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and\nWiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across\nthree RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both\ncross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or\ninference cost.",

However, existing VOS models often struggle with\nprecise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming\nobjects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce\nHQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a\nnovel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing\nthese limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)\nleveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based\ncandidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved\nobject boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that\nselectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby\noptimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and\n(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex\ntopological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These\ncontributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,\ncoarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update\nschedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues\nassociated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public\ndatasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method\nconsistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets.

The conventional\nparadigm of data visualization practices for policy and decision-making is to\nconvey data in a supposedly neutral, objective manner for rational\ndecision-makers. Feminist critique advocates for nuanced and reflexive\napproaches that take into account situated decision-makers and their affective\nrelationships to data. This paper sheds light on a key cognitive aspect that\nimpacts how decision-makers interpret data. Because all outcomes from policies\nrelevant to climate change occur at a distance, decision-makers experience\nso-called `psychological distance' to environmental decisions in terms of\nspace, time, social identity, and hypotheticality. This profoundly impacts how\nthey perceive and evaluate outcomes. Since policy decisions to achieve a safe\nplanetary space are urgently needed for immediate transition and change, we\nneed a design practice that takes into account how psychological distance\naffects cognition and decision-making. Our paper explores the role of\nalternative design approaches in developing visualizations used for climate\npolicymaking.

Their 14 velocity-confirmed satellite galaxies and the\ntwo hosts separate into two distinct subgroups in their line-of-sight\nvelocities and on-sky distribution revealing a prominent coherent kinematic\nstructure with a velocity amplitude of 67+-12 kms-1 . We test four scenarios to\nexplain the observed velocity field: isotropic motions in a dark matter halo, a\nplane of satellites seen nearly face-on, and a kinematically mixed satellite\nsystem with a co-rotating edge-on plane and an isotropic component, and a\nmerger of two small galaxy groups. Taking the geometry and dynamical state of\nthe NGC5713/19 pair into account together with their positions and motions in\nthe Bootes Strip the most consistent picture is the infall of two satellite\nsystems that follow their host galaxies along a cosmic filament. We believe\nthis is the first clear example of an equal-mass L* disk galaxy merger where a\nkinematically coherent satellite system is in the process of formation. These\nobservations reinforce the importance of major mergers as a channel for\nproducing co-rotating satellite systems.",

    "abstract": "Due to the high cost of collection and labeling, there are relatively few\ndatasets for camouflaged object detection (COD). In particular, for certain\nspecialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently\npopulated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of\nlimited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets\ncompared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To\ntackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely\nSyn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the\nmodel performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic\ncamouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be\nutilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework\n(CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA\npropagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled\ntarget domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization.\nConsidering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of\npseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an\nevolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain.

Thus, they cannot be resolved with local basis functions\nfor problems of even modest dimension. In this paper, we extend recent results\nthat utilize Kronecker products to generate polynomial approximations to HJB\nequations. Specifically, we consider the addition of linear drift terms that\nexhibit a Stokes-type differential-algebraic equation (DAE) structure. This\nextension leverages the so-called strangeness framework for DAEs to create\nseparate sets of algebraic and differential variables with differential\nequations that only involve the differential variables and algebraic equations\nthat relate them both. At this point, the existing polynomial approximations\nusing Kronecker products can be applied to find approximations to the energy\nfunctions. This approach is demonstrated for two polynomial feedback control\nproblems. The standard transformation destroys the sparsity in the original\nsystem.

Consider the class $\\mathcal{H}$ of\nall hyperfields with a given multiplicative group on $H^\\times = H - \\{0\\}$ and\ngiven value of $-1$. Then the addition of hyperfields in this class is\ndetermined by the set of pairs $(x,y)$ with $y \\in x+1$ for $x,y \\in H^\\times$.\nThere are blocks of such pairs, where $(x_0,y_0)$ and $(x_1,y_1)$ are in the\nsame block iff every hyperfield with $y_0 \\in x_0 + 1$ also has $y_1 \\in x_1 +\n1$. The theory of these blocks is developed, they can easily be computed\nwithout using hyperfields. Exploiting this theory of blocks would greatly speed\nup future computer searches for small hyperfields. The theory of blocks is then\nused to show that the number of nonquotient hyperfields of size $n$ grows\nexponentially with $n$, and that for even $n$ most hyperfields are nonquotient.\nA final application shows that a large class of finite hyperfields has the\nFETVINS property, meaning that systems of linear homogeneous equations with\nfewer equations than variables always have nontrivial solutions.",

    "abstract": "Strong light-matter interactions in 2D materials have garnered significant\ninterest for their potential in nonlinear optics and quantum photonics.\nTransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), with their robust excitonic\nresponses, serve as promising materials for exploring these interactions.\nImportantly, tailoring such strong coupling giving rise to tunable quantum and\nnon-linear emissions are under explored. In this study, we propose a novel\napproach that employs liquid crystals (LCs) as a tunable medium to modulate the\nstrong coupling between TMDC excitons and photonic modes and hence gives rise\nto tunable quantum emissions. LCs offer high birefringence and anisotropic\noptical properties, which can be dynamically tuned using external stimuli such\nas electric fields or temperature variations. By embedding TMDCs within an LC\nenvironment and coupling them to photonic quasi-bound states in the continuum\n(quasi-BIC), we demonstrate precise control over the exciton-photon\ninteractions. The orientation of the LCs, governed by applied external fields,\ndirectly influences the coupling strength, enabling real-time modulation of\nexciton-polariton states and Rabi-splitting. Our system exhibits Rabi splitting\nenergy of 182.5 MeV in air, and 139, 153.7, and 131 meV under different LC\norientations. Additionally second order autocorrelation function calculated at\nzero delay yields \\( g^{(2)}(0) = 0.89 \\), demonstrating photon anti-bunching,\nconfirming the quantum nature of emission.

Despite increasing interest in the discovery of new skyrmion hosts\nand their characterization, the electronic origins of the skyrmion formation\nremain unknown. Here, we study GdRu2X2 (X = Si, Ge, Sn) as a model system to\nstudy the connection among chemical bonding, electronic instability, and the\ncritical temperature and magnetic field at which skyrmions evolve. The nature\nof the electronic structure of GdRu2X2 is characterized by chemical bonding,\nFermi surface analysis, and density of energy function. As X-p orbitals become\nmore extended from Si-3p to Ge-4p and Sn-5p, improved interactions between the\nGd spins and the [Ru2X2] conduction layer and increased destabilizing energy\ncontributions are obtained. GdRu2Si2 possesses a Fermi surface nesting (FSN)\nvector [Q = (q, 0, 0)], whereas GdRu2Ge2 displays two inequivalent FSN vectors\n[Q = (q, 0, 0); QA = (q, q, 0)] and GdRu2Sn2 features multiple Q vectors. In\naddition, competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions\nin the Gd plane become more pronounced as a function of X. These results reveal\nsome correlation among the electronic instability, the competing interaction\nstrength, and the temperature and magnetic field conditions at which the\nskyrmions emerge.

Our approach largely focuses upon land\nusage and building distribution for creating realistic city environments,\nwhereas previous attempts at city modeling have mainly focused on populating\nroad networks.

Our philosophy is that as each agent follows a simple behavioral\nrule set, a more complex behavior will tend to emerge out of the interactions\nbetween the agents and their differing rule sets. By confining our model to a\nset of simple rules for each class of agents, we hope to make our model\nextendible not only in regard to the types of structures that are produced, but\nalso in describing the social and cultural influences prevalent in all cities",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel Stabilizer-Free weak Galerkin (WG) finite element\nmethod for solving the Brinkman equations without the need for conventional\nstabilization techniques. The Brinkman model, which mathematically blends\nfeatures of both the Stokes and Darcy equations, describes fluid flow in\nmulti-physics environments, particularly in heterogeneous porous media\ncharacterized by spatially varying permeability. In such settings, flow\nbehavior may be governed predominantly by Darcy dynamics in certain regions and\nby Stokes dynamics in others. A central difficulty in this context arises from\nthe incompatibility of standard finite element spaces: elements stable for the\nStokes equations typically perform poorly for Darcy flows, and vice versa. The\nprimary challenge addressed in this study is the development of a unified\nnumerical scheme that maintains stability and accuracy across both flow\nregimes. To this end, the proposed WG method demonstrates a robust capacity to\nresolve both Stokes- and Darcy-dominated flows through a unified framework. The\nmethod supports general finite element partitions consisting of convex and\nnon-convex polytopal elements, and employs bubble functions as a critical\nanalytical component to achieve stability and convergence. Optimal-order error\nestimates are rigorously derived for the WG finite element solutions.\nAdditionally, a series of numerical experiments is conducted to validate the\ntheoretical findings, illustrating the method's robustness, reliability,\nflexibility, and accuracy in solving the Brinkman equations.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to robotic control, but\neffective policy learning under partial observability remains a major\nchallenge, especially in high-dimensional tasks like humanoid locomotion. To\ndate, no prior work has demonstrated stable training of humanoid policies with\nincomplete state information in the benchmark Gymnasium Humanoid-v4\nenvironment. The objective in this environment is to walk forward as fast as\npossible without falling, with rewards provided for staying upright and moving\nforward, and penalties incurred for excessive actions and external contact\nforces. This research presents the first successful instance of learning under\npartial observability in this environment. The learned policy achieves\nperformance comparable to state-of-the-art results with full state access,\ndespite using only one-third to two-thirds of the original states. Moreover,\nthe policy exhibits adaptability to robot properties, such as variations in\nbody part masses. The key to this success is a novel history encoder that\nprocesses a fixed-length sequence of past observations in parallel. Integrated\ninto a standard model-free algorithm, the encoder enables performance on par\nwith fully observed baselines.

    "abstract": "Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time,\nand inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within\nthe floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans\nare minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric\ndifferences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this\ntask. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose\nfilters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization\nerrors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously\nshaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan\nLocalization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric\npriors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the\nview-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color\ncorrespondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB\nframes of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised\ncontrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are\nrequired. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the\nmodal gap while improving localization success without increasing the\ncomputational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nand substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy.

Recent work explores how to use this\ninformation to integrate external controls, including the use of hybrid control\ntrials (HCTs) where a randomized controlled trial is augmented with external\ncontrols. HCTs are of particular interest due to their ability to preserve\npartial randomization while also improving trial efficiency. However, most HCT\nestimators rely on an unrealistic assumption: that the external controls are\ndrawn from the same population as the trial subjects (perhaps conditionally on\ncovariates). There has been little formal work to quantify the inevitable bias\nintroduced from a violation of this assumption, slowing the acceptance of HCT\ndesigns. To address this, we introduce a non-parametric sensitivity analysis\nthat recognizes that the assumption can be reframed as a \"no unobserved\nconfounders\" assumption. We leverage omitted variable bias methodologies to\nestimate the maximum bias introduced from unmeasured covariates, allowing for a\ncritical evaluation of the causal gap that can invalidate significant findings.\nWe show that with a relatively weak understanding of the covariate-outcome\nrelationship and the distinguishability of trial and external subjects, this\nmethod reliably bounds bias while also allowing for gains in efficiency. We\nconclude by discussing considerations for designing and evaluating HCTs,\ndrawing on insights from simulations and theoretical analyses.",

In order to overcome the radial velocity (RV) precision barrier\nimposed by stellar variability, there has been a surge of software aimed at\nsimulating and modeling these activity patterns. Aims. We present Analyzing\nRadial Velocity Elements (ARVE), a Python-based software which enables RV\nextraction using various customizable techniques, and subsequent analysis of\nthe stellar and planetary signals present in the RVs. One of ARVE's unique\nfeatures is its library of pre-computed auxiliary data, which includes\nsynthetic spectra and spectral line masks, allowing the code to efficiently\nperform certain routines with minimal input from the user. Methods. ARVE is a\nclass-based and modular code in which its functionalities are divided between\nfour subclasses: functions, which handles general functions utilized by the\nother subclasses; data, which reads the input data, loads the auxiliary data,\nand extracts RVs from input high-resolution spectra; star, which characterizes\nthe stellar activity components present in the RV time series; and planets,\nwhich performs fits of Keplerian signals in the data and offers\ninjection-recovery tests of fictitious planets to determine the detection\nlimits.

Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with\nRules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves\nsystematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting\nmodules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive\nneocortical pattern recognition.

By\nexplicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed\nschematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations\nthrough explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on\nfrozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks.

    "abstract": "Efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a\nchallenging problem when receiving only a team reward, especially in\nenvironments with sparse rewards. A powerful method to mitigate this issue\ninvolves crafting dense individual rewards to guide the agents toward efficient\nexploration. However, individual rewards generally rely on manually engineered\nshaping-reward functions that lack high-order intelligence, thus it behaves\nineffectively than humans regarding learning and generalization in complex\nproblems. To tackle these issues, we combine the above two paradigms and\npropose a novel framework, LIGHT (Learning Individual Intrinsic reward via\nIncorporating Generalized Human experTise), which can integrate human knowledge\ninto MARL algorithms in an end-to-end manner. LIGHT guides each agent to avoid\nunnecessary exploration by considering both individual action distribution and\nhuman expertise preference distribution. Then, LIGHT designs individual\nintrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational\ntransformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action\npreferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over\nrepresentative baselines regarding performance and better knowledge reusability\nacross different sparse-reward tasks on challenging scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Background: Hypertensive kidney disease (HKD) patients in intensive care\nunits (ICUs) face high short-term mortality, but tailored risk prediction tools\nare lacking. Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for\nclinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to\npredict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early\nclinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was\ncurated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical\nfeatures-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were\nselected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several\nmodels were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation;\nCatBoost demonstrated the best performance. Results: CatBoost achieved an AUROC\nof 0.88 on the independent test set, with sensitivity of 0.811 and specificity\nof 0.798. SHAP values and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots showed the\nmodel relied on meaningful predictors such as altered consciousness,\nvasopressor use, and coagulation status. Additionally, the DREAM algorithm was\nintegrated to estimate patient-specific posterior risk distributions, allowing\nclinicians to assess both predicted mortality and its uncertainty. Conclusions:\nWe present an interpretable machine learning pipeline for early, real-time risk\nassessment in ICU patients with HKD. By combining high predictive performance\nwith uncertainty quantification, our model supports individualized triage and\ntransparent clinical decisions. This approach shows promise for clinical\ndeployment and merits external validation in broader critical care populations.",

These secondary outcomes, which can be derived from\ntraditional endpoints in clinical trials, compound measures, or risk prediction\nscores, hold the potential to enhance the analysis of primary outcomes. Our\nmethod is motivated by the challenge of utilizing multiple secondary outcomes,\nsuch as blood biochemistry markers and urine assays, to improve the analysis of\nthe primary outcome related to liver health. Current integration methods often\nfall short, as they impose strong model assumptions or require prior knowledge\nto construct over-identified working functions. This paper addresses these\nstatistical challenges and potentially opens a new avenue in data integration\nby introducing a novel integrative learning framework that is applicable in a\ngeneral setting. The proposed framework allows for the robust, data-driven\nintegration of information from multiple secondary outcomes, promotes the\ndevelopment of efficient learning algorithms, and ensures optimal use of\navailable data. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod significantly reduces variance in primary outcome analysis,\noutperforming existing integration approaches.

    "abstract": "Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) is a challenging task that\ninvolves interpreting spoken language solely from visual information, such as\nlip movements and facial expressions. This task is notably challenging due to\nthe absence of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes that exhibit\nsimilar visemes-distinct sounds that appear identical in lip motions. Existing\nmethods often aim to predict words or characters directly from visual cues, but\nthey commonly suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require\nlarge amounts of pre-training data. We propose a novel phoneme-based two-stage\nframework that fuses visual and landmark motion features, followed by an LLM\nmodel for word reconstruction to address these challenges. Stage 1 consists of\nV-ASR, which outputs the predicted phonemes, thereby reducing training\ncomplexity. Meanwhile, the facial landmark features address speaker-specific\nfacial characteristics. Stage 2 comprises an encoder-decoder LLM model, NLLB,\nthat reconstructs the output phonemes back to words. Besides using a large\nvisual dataset for deep learning fine-tuning, our PV-ASR method demonstrates\nsuperior performance by achieving 17.4% WER on the LRS2 and 21.0% WER on the\nLRS3 dataset.",

    "abstract": "Traditional long-term microgrid planning models assume constant power\ncharging for battery energy storage systems (BESS), overlooking efficiency\nlosses that occur toward the end of charge due to rising internal resistance.\nWhile this issue can be mitigated at the cell level using constant\ncurrent-constant voltage (CCCV) charging, it is impractical at the pack level\nin large-scale systems. However, battery management systems and inverter\ncontrols can emulate this effect by tapering charging power at high\nstate-of-charge (SOC) levels, trading off charging speed for improved\nefficiency and reduced thermal stress. Ignoring this behavior in planning\nmodels can lead to undersized batteries and potential reliability issues. This\npaper proposes a tractable and scalable approach to approximate CCCV behavior\nusing SOC-dependent tapered charging power (TCP) constraints. A MATLAB-based\nproof of concept demonstrates the energy delivery and efficiency benefits of\ntapering. The method is integrated into a long-term planning framework and\nevaluated under a synthetic load and solar profile. Results show tapering\nsignificantly affects BESS sizing, cost, and reliability under dynamic\noperating conditions that demand fast charging. These findings highlight\ntapering as a critical modeling factor for accurately capturing BESS\nperformance in long-term microgrid planning.",

    "abstract": "In 2011, Rubey generalized chute and ladder moves on the set of reduced pipe\ndreams for a permutation $w$ and conjectured that the induced poset on reduced\npipe dreams is a lattice. In this paper, we prove this conjecture. Our key tool\nis a new type of move operation $\\mathcal{M}_{ij}$, defined as a composite of\ncertain general ladder moves in Rubey's poset. We show that joins and meets\nexist in Rubey's poset by proving simple recursive formulas in terms of\n$\\mathcal{M}_{ij}$ operations. In addition, we give an explicit criterion to\ndetermine if two elements of Rubey's poset are comparable.",
