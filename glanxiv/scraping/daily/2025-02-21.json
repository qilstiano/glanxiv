    "abstract": "Precise tracking and measurement of the energy carried by the individual\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes has important implications and utility in\nastrophysical and laboratory plasmas. Previously, this was only achievable in\nlimited linear MHD cases in the $\\beta \\ll 1$ or $\\beta \\gg 1$ regimes. In a\nseries of papers, of which this is the third, we introduced the Eigenenergy\nDecomposition Method (EEDM) and derived exact analytical expressions for the\nmodal energy components--called eigenenergies--of nonlinear 3D disturbances\ngoverned by the homogeneous ideal-MHD equations. Here, we extend the method to\ninhomogeneous ideal-MHD by introducing a source term accounting for gravity,\nand provide detailed guidelines for applying the decomposition scheme to any\ngeneral inhomogeneous quasi-linear PDEs that possess a globally conserved\nquantity, beyond the realm of MHD. Furthermore, we show that the eigenenergies\ncan be used to locate and measure nonlinear mode conversions, which is an\nadditional feature of the method. Finally, we provide well-categorized context\nfor the application of the method to simulations and discuss the possible\nnumerical inaccuracies that may inevitably arise due to discretization. This\npaper provides a more mature description of the method and its interpretation,\nand is recommended as the starting point for readers unfamiliar with the\nmethod.",

    "abstract": "Despite increasing discussions on open-source Artificial Intelligence (AI),\nexisting research lacks a discussion on the transparency and accessibility of\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) Large Language Models (LLMs). The Open Source\nInitiative (OSI) has recently released its first formal definition of\nopen-source software. This definition, when combined with standard dictionary\ndefinitions and the sparse published literature, provide an initial framework\nto support broader accessibility to AI models such as LLMs, but more work is\nessential to capture the unique dynamics of openness in AI. In addition,\nconcerns about open-washing, where models claim openness but lack full\ntransparency, has been raised, which limits the reproducibility, bias\nmitigation, and domain adaptation of these models. In this context, our study\ncritically analyzes SoTA LLMs from the last five years, including ChatGPT,\nDeepSeek, LLaMA, and others, to assess their adherence to transparency\nstandards and the implications of partial openness. Specifically, we examine\ntransparency and accessibility from two perspectives: open-source vs.\nopen-weight models. Our findings reveal that while some models are labeled as\nopen-source, this does not necessarily mean they are fully open-sourced. Even\nin the best cases, open-source models often do not report model training data,\nand code as well as key metrics, such as weight accessibility, and carbon\nemissions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that\nsystematically examines the transparency and accessibility of over 100\ndifferent SoTA LLMs through the dual lens of open-source and open-weight\nmodels. The findings open avenues for further research and call for responsible\nand sustainable AI practices to ensure greater transparency, accountability,\nand ethical deployment of these models.(DeepSeek transparency, ChatGPT\naccessibility, open source, DeepSeek open source)",

As a\nconsequence of our results, for noisy one bit quantized linear measurements\n($\\mathsf{1bCSbinary}$), we obtain a sample complexity of\n$O((k+\\sigma^2)\\log{n})$, where $\\sigma^2$ is the noise variance. This is shown\nto be optimal due to the information theoretic lower bound. We also obtain\ntight sample complexity characterization for logistic regression.\n  Since $\\mathsf{1bCSbinary}$ is a strictly harder problem than noisy linear\nmeasurements ($\\mathsf{SparseLinearReg}$) because of added quantization, the\nsame sample complexity is achievable for $\\mathsf{SparseLinearReg}$. While this\nsample complexity can be obtained via the popular lasso algorithm, linear\nestimation is computationally more efficient. Our lower bound holds for any set\nof measurements for $\\mathsf{SparseLinearReg}$, (similar bound was known for\nGaussian measurement matrices) and is closely matched by the maximum-likelihood\nupper bound. For $\\mathsf{SparseLinearReg}$, it was conjectured in Gamarnik and\nZadik, 2017 that there is a statistical-computational gap and the number of\nmeasurements should be at least $(2k+\\sigma^2)\\log{n}$ for efficient algorithms\nto exist.

We\ndefine a frequentist counterpart to the lfdr based on the relative frequency of\nnulls at each point in the sample space. The frequentist lfdr is defined\nwithout reference to any prior, but preserves several important properties of\nthe Bayesian lfdr: For continuous test statistics, $\\text{lfdr}(t)$ gives the\nprobability, conditional on observing some statistic equal to $t$, that the\ncorresponding null hypothesis is true. Evaluating the lfdr at an individual\ntest statistic also yields a calibrated forecast of whether its null hypothesis\nis true. Finally, thresholding the lfdr at $\\frac{1}{1+\\lambda}$ gives the best\nseparable rejection rule under the weighted classification loss where Type I\nerrors are $\\lambda$ times as costly as Type II errors. The lfdr can be\nestimated efficiently using parametric or non-parametric methods, and a closely\nrelated error criterion can be provably controlled in finite samples under\nindependence assumptions. Whereas the FDR measures the average quality of all\ndiscoveries in a given rejection region, our lfdr measures how the quality of\ndiscoveries varies across the rejection region, allowing for a more\nfine-grained analysis without requiring the introduction of a prior.",

In many LLM applications, different inputs can\nshare overlapping context, such as the same retrieved document appearing in\nmultiple queries. However, the LLMs still need to encode the entire context for\neach query, leading to redundant computation. In this paper, we investigate a\nnew strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each\ndocument is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of\nretrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached\nrepresentations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance\ndegradation when using KV caches computed independently for each document,\nKVLink introduces two key techniques: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV\ncache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, and using\ntrainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded\ndocuments. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves\nquestion answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods.\nFurthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces\ntime-to-first-token by up to 96% compared to standard LLM inference, making it\na scalable and efficient solution for context reuse.

This\nmakes it difficult for tool builders beyond the original vendor to target or\nsimulate the hardware correctly, or for algorithm designers to be confident in\ntheir code. To address these gaps, prior studies have probed the behavior of\nthese units with manually crafted tests. Such tests are cumbersome to design,\nand adapting them as the accelerators evolve requires repeated manual effort.\n  We present a formal model for the tensor cores of Nvidia's Volta, Turing, and\nAmpere GPUs. We identify specific properties -- rounding mode, precision, and\naccumulation order -- that drive these cores' behavior. We formalize these\nproperties and then use the formalization to automatically generate\ndiscriminating inputs that illustrate differences among machines. Our results\nconfirm many of the findings of previous tensor core studies, but also identify\nsubtle disagreements. In particular, Nvidia's machines do not, as previously\nreported, use round-to-zero for accumulation, and their 5-term accumulator\nrequires 3 extra carry-out bits for full accuracy. Using our formal model, we\nanalyze two existing algorithms that use half-precision tensor cores to\naccelerate single-precision multiplication with error correction.

In particular, we ask the question: how accurate\nis the scalar approximation? Using the worldline approach, it appears that a\nsimple sum of the contributions from the two polarizations agrees with the\nexact Casimir-Polder force for two-atom systems.

To enable calculations beyond two atoms via\nworldlines, we develop general $N$-atom expressions for the Casimir-Polder\nforce within the scalar approximation. For three-body systems, the scalar\nworldline method fails drastically, predicting significant discrepancies in\nboth magnitude and sign due to strong polarization mixing. Furthermore, we show\nthat the TE/TM decomposition in the worldline method differs from that of the\nGreen-tensor formalism, and we discuss why this is.

In this work, we perform a novel\nmeasurement of the \"external cross-talk\" (ExCT) of SiPMs, where photons\nproduced in the avalanche process escape the device and produce correlated\nsignals on other SiPMs. SiPMs are the photodetector technology of choice for\nnext generation rare-event search experiments; understanding the sources and\neffects of correlated noise in SiPMs is critical for producing accurate\nestimates of detector performance and sensitivity projections. We measure the\nprobability to observe ExCT through timing correlation of detected photons in\nlow-light conditions within LoLX. Measurements of SiPM ExCT are highly detector\ndependent; thus the ExCT process is simulated and modelled using the Geant4\nframework. Using the simulation, we determine the average transport and\ndetection efficiency for ExCT photons within LoLX, a necessary input to extract\nthe expected ExCT probability from the data. For an applied overvoltage of 4 V\nand 5 V, we measure a mean number of photons emitted into the LXe per avalanche\nof $0.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ and $0.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$, respectively.

We use several publicly available\nand proprietary LLMs for this task, and conducted experiments on two\nopen-source datasets and an in-house e-commerce search dataset.

We have generated query-product relevance labels\nusing LLMs at scale, and are using them for evaluating improvements to our\nsearch algorithms. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs to improve\nquery-product relevance thus enhancing e-commerce search user experience.

Finally, we give a characterization of\ngraphs with loops for which $h(G)=1$ by means of forbidden subgraphs, extending\na known characterization for simple graphs.",

    "abstract": "We investigate an emerging setup in which a small, on-device language model\n(LM) with access to local data communicates with a frontier, cloud-hosted LM to\nsolve real-world tasks involving financial, medical, and scientific reasoning\nover long documents. Can a local-remote collaboration reduce cloud inference\ncosts while preserving quality? First, we consider a naive collaboration\nprotocol where the local and remote models simply chat back and forth. Because\nonly the local model reads the full context, this protocol achieves a 30.4x\nreduction in remote costs, but recovers only 87% of the performance of the\nfrontier model. We identify two key limitations of this protocol: the local\nmodel struggles to (1) follow the remote model's multi-step instructions and\n(2) reason over long contexts. Motivated by these observations, we study an\nextension of this protocol, coined MinionS, in which the remote model\ndecomposes the task into easier subtasks over shorter chunks of the document,\nthat are executed locally in parallel. MinionS reduces costs by 5.7x on average\nwhile recovering 97.9% of the performance of the remote model alone. Our\nanalysis reveals several key design choices that influence the trade-off\nbetween cost and performance in local-remote systems.",

    "abstract": "Accountability is an innate part of social systems. It maintains stability\nand ensures positive pressure on individuals' decision-making. As actors in a\nsocial system, software developers are accountable to their team and\norganization for their decisions. However, the drivers of accountability and\nhow it changes behavior in software development are less understood. In this\nstudy, we look at how the social aspects of code review affect software\nengineers' sense of accountability for code quality. Since software engineering\n(SE) is increasingly involving Large Language Models (LLM) assistance, we also\nevaluate the impact on accountability when introducing LLM-assisted code\nreviews. We carried out a two-phased sequential qualitative study (interviews\n-> focus groups). In Phase I (16 interviews), we sought to investigate the\nintrinsic drivers of software engineers influencing their sense of\naccountability for code quality, relying on self-reported claims. In Phase II,\nwe tested these traits in a more natural setting by simulating traditional\npeer-led reviews with focus groups and then LLM-assisted review sessions. We\nfound that there are four key intrinsic drivers of accountability for code\nquality: personal standards, professional integrity, pride in code quality, and\nmaintaining one's reputation. In a traditional peer-led review, we observed a\ntransition from individual to collective accountability when code reviews are\ninitiated. We also found that the introduction of LLM-assisted reviews disrupts\nthis accountability process, challenging the reciprocity of accountability\ntaking place in peer-led evaluations, i.e., one cannot be accountable to an\nLLM. Our findings imply that the introduction of AI into SE must preserve\nsocial integrity and collective accountability mechanisms.",

For retrieval,\nR$^3$Mem employs a reversible architecture, reconstructing raw data by invoking\nthe model backward with compressed information.

Experiments demonstrate that our memory design\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in long-context language modeling and\nretrieval-augmented generation tasks.

This raises the following natural question: Can\ntruly sublinear space utilization be achieved without such assumptions? In this\nwork, we answer this question in the negative. Any algorithm for\nattention-based token generation must use $\\Theta(nd)$ space, where $n$ is the\nnumber of tokens generated so far and $d = \\Omega(\\log n)$ is the dimension of\nthe KV embeddings. Our proof involves a reduction from a classic communication\ncomplexity problem and uses a randomized construction that leverages properties\nof projections in the spirit of the Johnson-Linderstrauss lemma. For the\nlow-dimensional regime $d = o(\\log n)$, we show that any algorithm requires\n$\\Omega(d\\cdot e^d)$ space and prove, using tight bounds on covering numbers,\nthat SubGen, proposed by Zandieh, Han, Mirrokni and Karbasi, matches this\nbound.

    "abstract": "HeH$^+$ belongs to the class of \"reactive\" ions that can be destroyed so\nquickly that chemical formation and destruction rates may compete with\ninelastic rates and should be considered when solving the statistical\nequilibrium equations. This so-called chemical \"pumping\" or \"excitation\" effect\nis investigated here for the first time in HeH$^+$. The chemical evolution of\nHeH$^+$ in NGC 7027 is modeled with the CLOUDY photoionization code using\nupdated reaction rate coefficients. The non-LTE analysis of the three observed\nHeH$^+$ emission lines is then performed with the CLOUDY and RADEX codes using\nan extensive set of spectroscopic and inelastic collisional data suitable for\nthe specific high-temperature environment of NGC 7027. In a second approach,\nchemical formation and destruction rates of HeH$^+$ are implemented in RADEX.\nThis code is combined with MCMC sampling (performed on the RADEX-parameters\nspace) to extract the best-fit HeH$^+$ column density and physical conditions\nfrom the observed line fluxes. The CLOUDY and RADEX non-LTE results are found\nto be in good agreement, and the $\\upsilon=1-0 \\ P(2)/P(1)$ line ratio is\nbetter than 20%. Agreement to better than a factor of 2.3 is obtained when\nincluding the reaction between He($2^3S$) and H as an additional source of\nHeH$^+$. The RADEX/MCMC model with chemical pumping is found to reproduce both\nthe observed line fluxes and the line ratio to 20%. Our results suggest that\nadditional HeH$^+$ lines must be detected in NGC 7027 to better constrain the\nphysical conditions via non-LTE models. Uncertainties in collisional (reactive\nand inelastic) data of HeH$^+$ have been largely reduced in this work. The\nthree observed lines are not sensitive to chemical pumping while excited\n\"short-lived\" levels are significantly overpopulated with respect to a non-LTE\nmodel neglecting chemical excitation.",

Due to asynchrony and data heterogeneity,\nlearning objectives at the global and local levels are inherently inconsistent\n-- global optimization trajectories may conflict with ongoing local updates.\nExisting asynchronous methods simply distribute the latest global weights to\nclients, which can overwrite local progress and cause model drift. In this\npaper, we propose OrthoFL, an orthogonal calibration framework that decouples\nglobal and local learning progress and adjusts global shifts to minimize\ninterference before merging them into local models. In OrthoFL, clients and the\nserver maintain separate model weights. Upon receiving an update, the server\naggregates it into the global weights via a moving average. For client weights,\nthe server computes the global weight shift accumulated during the client's\ndelay and removes the components aligned with the direction of the received\nupdate. The resulting parameters lie in a subspace orthogonal to the client\nupdate and preserve the maximal information from the global progress. The\ncalibrated global shift is then merged into the client weights for further\ntraining. Extensive experiments show that OrthoFL improves accuracy by 9.6% and\nachieves a 12$\\times$ speedup compared to synchronous methods. Moreover, it\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art asynchronous baselines under various\ndelay patterns and heterogeneity scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Long-term body identification algorithms have emerged recently with the\nincreased availability of high-quality training data. We seek to fill knowledge\ngaps about these models by analyzing body image embeddings from four body\nidentification networks trained with 1.9 million images across 4,788 identities\nand 9 databases. By analyzing a diverse range of architectures (ViT, SWIN-ViT,\nCNN, and linguistically primed CNN), we first show that the face contributes to\nthe accuracy of body identification algorithms and that these algorithms can\nidentify faces to some extent -- with no explicit face training. Second, we\nshow that representations (embeddings) generated by body identification\nalgorithms encode information about gender, as well as image-based information\nincluding view (yaw) and even the dataset from which the image originated.\nThird, we demonstrate that identification accuracy can be improved without\nadditional training by operating directly and selectively on the learned\nembedding space. Leveraging principal component analysis (PCA), identity\ncomparisons were consistently more accurate in subspaces that eliminated\ndimensions that explained large amounts of variance. These three findings were\nsurprisingly consistent across architectures and test datasets. This work\nrepresents the first analysis of body representations produced by long-term\nre-identification networks trained on challenging unconstrained datasets.",

Additionally, potential measurement\nerrors in the membrane potential due to sensor imprecision are considered. To\nsolve this problem, firstly, the original FitzHugh-Nagumo network is\ntransformed into a linear regression model, where the regressors are obtained\nby applying a filter-differentiator to specific combinations of the measured\nvariables. Secondly, the speed-gradient method is applied to this linear model,\nleading to the design of an identification algorithm for the FitzHugh-Nagumo\nneural network. Sufficient conditions for the asymptotic convergence of the\nparameter estimates to their true values are derived for the proposed\nalgorithm. Parameter estimation for a network of five interconnected neurons is\ndemonstrated through computer simulation.

    "abstract": "Answering complex, long-context questions remains a major challenge for large\nlanguage models (LLMs) as it requires effective question clarifications and\ncontext retrieval. We propose Agentic Long-Context Understanding (AgenticLU), a\nframework designed to enhance an LLM's understanding of such queries by\nintegrating targeted self-clarification with contextual grounding within an\nagentic workflow. At the core of AgenticLU is Chain-of-Clarifications (CoC),\nwhere models refine their understanding through self-generated clarification\nquestions and corresponding contextual groundings. By scaling inference as a\ntree search where each node represents a CoC step, we achieve 97.8% answer\nrecall on NarrativeQA with a search depth of up to three and a branching factor\nof eight. To amortize the high cost of this search process to training, we\nleverage the preference pairs for each step obtained by the CoC workflow and\nperform two-stage model finetuning: (1) supervised finetuning to learn\neffective decomposition strategies, and (2) direct preference optimization to\nenhance reasoning quality. This enables AgenticLU models to generate\nclarifications and retrieve relevant context effectively and efficiently in a\nsingle inference pass. Extensive experiments across seven long-context tasks\ndemonstrate that AgenticLU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompting\nmethods and specialized long-context LLMs, achieving robust multi-hop reasoning\nwhile sustaining consistent performance as context length grows.",

When\nsolved by Benders Decomposition (BD), the master problem becomes a binary\ninteger programming which is NP-hard and computationally demanding for\nclassical computational methods. Quantum Annealing (QA), known for efficiently\nsolving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, presents a\npotential solution. However, existing quantum algorithms rely on slack\nvariables to handle linear binary inequality constraints, leading to increased\nqubit consumption and reduced computational efficiency. To solve the problem,\nthis paper introduces the Powell-Hestenes-Rockafellar Augmented Lagrangian\nMultiplier (PHR-ALM) method to eliminate the need for slack variables so that\nthe qubit consumption becomes independent of the increasing number of bender's\ncuts. To further reduce the qubit overhead, quantum ADMM is applied to break\nlarge-scale SUC into smaller blocks and enables a sequential solution.\nConsequently, the Quantum-based PHR-ADMM (QPHR-ADMM) can significantly reduce\nqubit requirements and enhancing the applicability of QA in SUC problem.

Existing approaches involve monitoring devices such as\ncameras, wearables, and pressure mats, but have operational constraints such as\ndirect line-of-sight, carrying devices, and dense deployment. To overcome these\nlimitations, we leverage gait-induced floor vibration to estimate lower-limb\njoint motion (e.g., ankle, knee, and hip flexion angles), allowing\nnon-intrusive and contactless gait health monitoring in people's living spaces.\nTo overcome the high uncertainty in lower-limb movement given the limited\ninformation provided by the gait-induced floor vibrations, we formulate a\nphysics-informed graph to integrate domain knowledge of gait biomechanics and\nstructural dynamics into the model. Specifically, different types of nodes\nrepresent heterogeneous information from joint motions and floor vibrations;\nTheir connecting edges represent the physiological relationships between joints\nand forces governed by gait biomechanics, as well as the relationships between\nforces and floor responses governed by the structural dynamics. As a result,\nour model poses physical constraints to reduce uncertainty while allowing\ninformation sharing between the body and the floor to make more accurate\npredictions.

The subsequent cascade back to the\nground state is analyzed by ionizing the atoms in the field of a cw optical\ndipole trap laser. Conventional spectroscopic methods such as standard\ncold-target recoil-ion momentum spectroscopy (COLTRIMS) or velocity map imaging\n(VMI) cannot provide simultaneous momentum and time-resolved information on an\nevent-by-event basis for the system investigated here.

This enables the reconstruction of ionization\ntimes and time-of-flight of the charged target fragments with nanosecond\nresolution.

With the rise of large language models (LLMs) and\ngenerative AI, developers now have access to a wealth of high-quality\nopen-source models and APIs from closed-source providers, enabling easier\nexperimentation and integration of LLMs into various systems. This has also\nopened new possibilities in mobile application (app) development, allowing for\nmore personalized and intelligent apps. However, integrating LLM into mobile\napps might present unique challenges for developers, particularly regarding\nmobile device constraints, API management, and code infrastructure.

In order to\nautomate these processes, machine learning methods can be developed and\nimplemented, but in many cases these methods require the use of an inverse\nmodel which maps the output of the experiment, such as a detector image, to the\nparameters of the device. Due to limited experimental data, such models are\noften trained with simulated data, which creates the challenge of compensating\nfor the inherent differences between simulation and experiment.

This\nmonograph aims to explain the success of these methods, both in theory, for\nwhich we cover foundational nonasymptotic statistical guarantees on\nnearest-neighbor-based regression and classification, and in practice, for\nwhich we gather prominent methods for approximate nearest neighbor search that\nhave been essential to scaling prediction systems reliant on nearest neighbor\nanalysis to handle massive datasets. Furthermore, we discuss connections to\nlearning distances for use with nearest neighbor methods, including how random\ndecision trees and ensemble methods learn nearest neighbor structure, as well\nas recent developments in crowdsourcing and graphons.\n  In terms of theory, our focus is on nonasymptotic statistical guarantees,\nwhich we state in the form of how many training data and what algorithm\nparameters ensure that a nearest neighbor prediction method achieves a\nuser-specified error tolerance. We begin with the most general of such results\nfor nearest neighbor and related kernel regression and classification in\ngeneral metric spaces. In such settings in which we assume very little\nstructure, what enables successful prediction is smoothness in the function\nbeing estimated for regression, and a low probability of landing near the\ndecision boundary for classification. In practice, these conditions could be\ndifficult to verify for a real dataset. We then cover recent guarantees on\nnearest neighbor prediction in the three case studies of time series\nforecasting, recommending products to people over time, and delineating human\norgans in medical images by looking at image patches.

To meet the emerging requirements for hard X-ray focal plane\ndetectors for providing simultaneous diagnostics of spectrally (<1 keV FWHM)\nand spatially (<50 um) separated coronal and chromospheric emissions from solar\nflares, we developed a new strip-configuration detector called the wide-gap\nCdTe semiconductor double-sided strip detector (CdTe-DSD). The wide-gap\nCdTe-DSD employs a unique design principle to enhance position resolution. This\nenhancement is realized by expanding the gaps between electrodes to induce\ncharge-sharing across adjacent strip electrodes and using this sharing energy\ninformation for position reconstruction to a level finer than the strip-pitch.\nHowever, the detector response becomes complex and requires consideration of\nvarious factors, such as the charge loss due to wider gaps and the dependence\non the depth of photon interaction. Thus, we developed an energy reconstruction\nmethod that fully leverages the energy information between adjacent strips and\nfrom both the cathode and anode sides, achieving an energy resolution of 0.75\nkeV (FWHM) at 14 keV. Furthermore, we conducted an X-ray scanning experiment\nusing a synchrotron beam at Spring-8 to evaluate the detector response with a\nfine scale of 10 um. Based on these results, we established a sub-strip\nposition reconstruction method, demonstrating that X-rays interacting at the\ncenter of the gap can be determined with an accuracy of 20 um, and even those\nat the strip center can be determined with an accuracy of 50 um.",

An important property of\nWeingarten functions, is their particularly simple large $N$ limits. In 2017\nBenoit Collins and Sho Matsumoto studied when this limit holds for Weingarten\nfunctions associated to integrals of products of $2n$ matrix entries, as $n \\to\n\\infty$, together with the matrix size $N$. They showed that the large $N$\nlimit is uniformly achieved as long as $n=o(N^{4/7})$, a result which already\nhas applications to strong asymptotic freeness. However, their result is not\noptimal. They conjectured that their result should actually hold up to\n$n=o(N^{2/3})$ which is optimal. We prove this conjecture for the matrix groups\n$G \\in \\{\\mathrm{U}(N)$, $\\mathrm{O}(N)$, $\\mathrm{Sp}(N)\\}$. The proof\nproceeds by introducing a Markov process on permutations (pairings) which we\ncall the unitary (orthogonal) \\textit{Weingarten process}.

This\nprocedure raises critical questions about representativeness as no sample can\ncapture the properties of the original graph perfectly, and different parts of\nthe graph are not evenly affected by the loss. Recent work has shown that the\ndistances from the non-sampled nodes to the sampled nodes can be a quantitative\nindicator of bias and fairness in graph machine learning. However, to our\nknowledge, there is no method for evaluating how a sampling method affects the\ndistribution of shortest-path distances without actually performing the\nsampling and shortest-path calculation.\n  In this paper, we present an accurate and efficient framework for estimating\nthe distribution of shortest-path distances to the sample, applicable to a wide\nrange of sampling methods and graph structures. Our framework is faster than\nempirical methods and only requires the specification of degree distributions.\nWe also extend our framework to handle graphs with community structures.

NEOWise monitoring reveals that the mid-IR wavelength brightness of\nHOPS 358 follows a similar long-term pattern in time.

We detect both HOPS 358 and its southern companion, HOPS\n358B, in our ALMA observations, and find that at least one of the two is\nvarying. Assuming that HOPS 358 is the variable, the light curve has the same\nshape as that found by the JCMT. Additionally, our high resolution ALMA imaging\nof HOPS 358 reveals that the disk is warped, with a $16^{\\circ}$ warp at a disk\nradius of 35 au, about halfway through the extent of the disk. The physical\norigin of the warp along with how it relates to the variability seen towards\nHOPS 358, however, remain unclear.",

    "abstract": "Recently, it was proposed that an off-center dipole magnetic configuration,\ntogether with a non-trivial temperature profile, may be the best model to\nexplain the X-ray light curve of PSR J0030+0451 observed by the Neutron Star\nInterior Composition Explorer (\\emph{NICER}). Using a theoretical model for the\nelectric current density in a force-free pulsar magnetosphere, we compute from\nfirst principles the distribution of electric current over the polar cap\nassociated with an off-center magnetic dipole. We then use a simple\nprescription to compute the resulting temperature distribution, which allows us\nto derive the observed X-ray light curve. We investigate the role of the\nvolumetric return current region in the polar cap and find that although it\ndoes not make a big difference in an aligned dipole case, the difference can be\nbigger in the case of an off-center dipole. Finally, we apply Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) fitting to the X-ray light curves of pulsars PSR J0030+0451\nand PSR J0437--4715 with and without the volumetric return current, and find\nthat our model can reasonably recover the observed X-ray light curves.",

    "abstract": "Dwarf galaxies are observed to have linearly rising rotation curves, which\nindicate constant density cores in their centers. These do not arise naturally\nfrom dark matter only simulations, giving rise to the ``core-cusp'' problem.\nHydrodynamic simulations incorporating baryonic feedback can create cored\nprofiles, but this solution requires some fine tuning. Additionally, there is a\nrelated ``diversity'' problem in which simulations cannot reproduce the large\nrange in rotation curve shapes for galaxies of similar mass. Here we\ninvestigate, for the first time, whether a theoretical model based on\nstatistical mechanics (DARKexp) can produce flat density cores with its single\nshape parameter. We find that these theoretical profiles are able to fit the\nobserved rotation curves of galaxies with last measured velocities in the range\n~ 20-200 km/s by producing fits to 96 SPARC catalog galaxies covering this\nrange. We additionally show that the projected stellar density distributions of\nultrafaint dwarfs that show cores are also well fit, and that wave, or fuzzy\ndark matter is unable to fit the full range of SPARC galaxies. Thus, DARKexp\nappears to be able to address the core-cusp problem and the diversity of\nrotation curves in these dark matter dominated galaxies with cold collisionless\ndark matter alone, i.e., without introducing baryonic feedback, or alternative\nnature of dark matter.",

Hydrodynamical\nsimulations are the most principled approach to model galaxy formation, but\nhave large computational costs. Recently, emulation techniques based on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed to predict baryonic\nproperties directly from dark matter simulations. The advantage of these\nemulators is their ability to capture relevant correlations, but at a fraction\nof the computational cost compared to simulations. However, training basic CNNs\nover large redshift ranges is challenging, due to the increasing non-linear\ninterplay between dark matter and baryons paired with the memory inefficiency\nof CNNs. This work introduces EMBER-2, an improved version of the EMBER\n(EMulating Baryonic EnRichment) framework, to simultaneously emulate multiple\nbaryon channels including gas density, velocity, temperature and HI density\nover a large redshift range, from z=6 to z=0. EMBER-2 incorporates a\ncontext-based styling network paired with Modulated Convolutions for fast,\naccurate and memory efficient emulation capable of interpolating the entire\nredshift range with a single CNN. Although EMBER-2 uses fewer than 1/6 the\nnumber of trainable parameters than the previous version, the model improves in\nevery tested summary metric including gas mass conservation and\ncross-correlation coefficients. The EMBER-2 framework builds the foundation to\nproduce mock catalogues of field level data and derived summary statistics that\ncan directly be incorporated in future analysis pipelines.

    "abstract": "Sampling from diffusion models involves a slow iterative process that hinders\ntheir practical deployment, especially for interactive applications. To\naccelerate generation speed, recent approaches distill a multi-step diffusion\nmodel into a single-step student generator via variational score distillation,\nwhich matches the distribution of samples generated by the student to the\nteacher's distribution. However, these approaches use the reverse\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for distribution matching which is known to be\nmode seeking. In this paper, we generalize the distribution matching approach\nusing a novel $f$-divergence minimization framework, termed $f$-distill, that\ncovers different divergences with different trade-offs in terms of mode\ncoverage and training variance. We derive the gradient of the $f$-divergence\nbetween the teacher and student distributions and show that it is expressed as\nthe product of their score differences and a weighting function determined by\ntheir density ratio. This weighting function naturally emphasizes samples with\nhigher density in the teacher distribution, when using a less mode-seeking\ndivergence. We observe that the popular variational score distillation approach\nusing the reverse-KL divergence is a special case within our framework.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate that alternative $f$-divergences, such as\nforward-KL and Jensen-Shannon divergences, outperform the current best\nvariational score distillation methods across image generation tasks. In\nparticular, when using Jensen-Shannon divergence, $f$-distill achieves current\nstate-of-the-art one-step generation performance on ImageNet64 and zero-shot\ntext-to-image generation on MS-COCO.

    "abstract": "Locate-then-Edit Knowledge Editing (LEKE) is a key technique for updating\nlarge language models (LLMs) without full retraining. However, existing methods\nassume a single-user setting and become inefficient in real-world multi-client\nscenarios, where decentralized organizations (e.g., hospitals, financial\ninstitutions) independently update overlapping knowledge, leading to redundant\nmediator knowledge vector (MKV) computations and privacy concerns. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce Federated Locate-then-Edit Knowledge Editing\n(FLEKE), a novel task that enables multiple clients to collaboratively perform\nLEKE while preserving privacy and reducing computational overhead. To achieve\nthis, we propose FedEdit, a two-stage framework that optimizes MKV selection\nand reuse. In the first stage, clients locally apply LEKE and upload the\ncomputed MKVs. In the second stage, rather than relying solely on server-based\nMKV sharing, FLEKE allows clients retrieve relevant MKVs based on cosine\nsimilarity, enabling knowledge re-edit and minimizing redundant computations.\nExperimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedEdit retains\nover 96% of the performance of non-federated LEKE while significantly\noutperforming a FedAvg-based baseline by approximately twofold. Besides, we\nfind that MEMIT performs more consistently than PMET in the FLEKE task with our\nFedEdit framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/zongkaiz/FLEKE.",

Current approaches\nto ToM reasoning either rely on prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), which\nare prone to systematic errors, or use handcrafted, rigid agent models for\nmodel-based inference, which are more robust but fail to generalize across\ndomains. In this work, we introduce AutoToM, an automated agent modeling method\nfor scalable, robust, and interpretable mental inference. Given a ToM problem,\nAutoToM first proposes an initial agent model and then performs automated\nBayesian inverse planning based on this model, leveraging an LLM backend.\nGuided by inference uncertainty, it iteratively refines the model by\nintroducing additional mental variables and/or incorporating more timesteps in\nthe context.

    "abstract": "Graph modification problems are computational tasks where the goal is to\nchange an input graph $G$ using operations from a fixed set, in order to make\nthe resulting graph satisfy a target property, which usually entails membership\nto a desired graph class $\\mathcal{C}$. Some well-known examples of operations\ninclude vertex-deletion, edge-deletion, edge-addition and edge-contraction. In\nthis paper we address an operation known as subgraph complement. Given a graph\n$G$ and a subset $S$ of its vertices, the subgraph complement $G \\oplus S$ is\nthe graph resulting of complementing the edge set of the subgraph induced by\n$S$ in $G$. We say that a graph $H$ is a subgraph complement of $G$ if there is\nan $S$ such that $H$ is isomorphic to $G \\oplus S$. For a graph class\n$\\mathcal{C}$, subgraph complementation to $\\mathcal{C}$ is the problem of\ndeciding, for a given graph $G$, whether $G$ has a subgraph complement in\n$\\mathcal{C}$. This problem has been studied and its complexity has been\nsettled for many classes $\\mathcal{C}$ such as $\\mathcal{H}$-free graphs, for\nvarious families $\\mathcal{H}$, and for classes of bounded degeneracy. In this\nwork, we focus on classes graphs of minimum/maximum degree upper/lower bounded\nby some value $k$.

To address these findings from a\ntheoretical point of view, first principles calculations based on density\nfunctional theory (DFT) were performed. The optical properties of\ncation-defective ZnS were evaluated using random-phase approximation and hybrid\nfunctional DFT calculations. These calculations revealed absorption peaks in\nthe visible range in the defective ZnS rather than solely in the ultra-violet\nrange obtained for defect-free ZnS.

These challenges include truthfulness, where models\ngenerate misleading information; privacy, with risks of unintentional data\nretention; robustness, requiring defenses against adversarial attacks;\nfairness, addressing biases in clinical outcomes; explainability, ensuring\ntransparent decision-making; and safety, mitigating risks of misinformation and\nmedical errors.

    "abstract": "This study investigates how individuals' perceptions of artificial\nintelligence (AI) limitations influence organizational readiness for AI\nadoption. Through semi-structured interviews with seven AI implementation\nexperts, analyzed using the Gioia methodology, the research reveals that\norganizational readiness emerges through dynamic interactions between\nindividual sensemaking, social learning, and formal integration processes. The\nfindings demonstrate that hands-on experience with AI limitations leads to more\nrealistic expectations and increased trust, mainly when supported by peer\nnetworks and champion systems. Organizations that successfully translate these\nindividual and collective insights into formal governance structures achieve\nmore sustainable AI adoption. The study advances theory by showing how\norganizational readiness for AI adoption evolves through continuous cycles of\nindividual understanding, social learning, and organizational adaptation. These\ninsights suggest that organizations should approach AI adoption not as a\none-time implementation but as an ongoing strategic learning process that\nbalances innovation with practical constraints. The research contributes to\norganizational readiness theory and practice by illuminating how micro-level\nperceptions and experiences shape macro-level adoption outcomes.",

Despite how useful these systems\nmight be, unchecked AI agency poses significant risks to public safety and\nsecurity, ranging from misuse by malicious actors to a potentially irreversible\nloss of human control. We discuss how these risks arise from current AI\ntraining methods. Indeed, various scenarios and experiments have demonstrated\nthe possibility of AI agents engaging in deception or pursuing goals that were\nnot specified by human operators and that conflict with human interests, such\nas self-preservation. Following the precautionary principle, we see a strong\nneed for safer, yet still useful, alternatives to the current agency-driven\ntrajectory. Accordingly, we propose as a core building block for further\nadvances the development of a non-agentic AI system that is trustworthy and\nsafe by design, which we call Scientist AI. This system is designed to explain\nthe world from observations, as opposed to taking actions in it to imitate or\nplease humans. It comprises a world model that generates theories to explain\ndata and a question-answering inference machine. Both components operate with\nan explicit notion of uncertainty to mitigate the risks of overconfident\npredictions. In light of these considerations, a Scientist AI could be used to\nassist human researchers in accelerating scientific progress, including in AI\nsafety.

    "abstract": "Stellar streams are remnants of globular clusters or dwarf galaxies that have\nbeen tidally disrupted by the gravitational potential of their host galaxy.\nStreams originating from dwarfs can be particularly compelling targets for\nindirect dark matter (DM) searches, as dwarfs are believed to be highly\nDM-dominated systems. Although these streams are expected to lose most of their\nDM during the tidal stretching process, a significant amount may still remain\nin their core. If DM is composed of WIMPs, their annihilation within the\nstreams' cores could produce a detectable gamma-ray signal. In this study, we\nanalyze nearly 15 years of data from the Large Area Telescope aboard NASA's\nFermi satellite (Fermi-LAT) to search for potential WIMP annihilation signals\nfrom the direction of 11 stellar streams selected using DM-motivated criteria.\nNo gamma-ray emission is detected from any of the streams in our sample. In the\nabsence of a signal, we place the first constraints on the WIMP parameter space\nbased on these objects for two representative annihilation channels. Individual\nDM limits are first computed and then combined across all streams. The most\nreliable combined constraints, derived from a golden sample and using a\nbenchmark description of their DM content, are $O(10)$ times above the thermal\nrelic cross-section for the $bb$ and $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ annihilation channels. We\nalso explore how these constraints vary under more conservative or optimistic\nyet realistic assumptions, finding variations of up to a few orders of\nmagnitude. This large systematic uncertainty stems from key model limitations,\nwhich can and should be addressed in future observations and simulations to\nproduce more robust DM limits from streams. Despite uncertainties, this study\ndemonstrates the feasibility of using stellar streams for DM searches and\nhighlights their significant potential to uncover the properties of DM\nparticles.",

This weakens the connection\nbetween original codewords and quotient codewords which introduces a richer\nrange of behaviors along with substantial new challenges.\n  Our goal is to answer the following question: what properties of $\\tilde{X}$\nwill imply that the quotient code inherits its distance and list-decoding\nradius from the original code? We address this question using techniques\ndeveloped by Bhowmick and Lovett [BL14], identifying key properties of\n$\\mathbb{F}^n$ used in their proof and extending them to general subsets\n$\\tilde{X} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}^n$. By introducing a new tool, we overcome the\nnovel challenge in analyzing the quotient code that arises from the weak\nconnection between original and quotient codewords. This enables us to apply\nknown results from additive combinatorics and algebraic geometry [KZ18, KZ19,\nLZ21] to show that when $\\tilde{X}$ is a \\emph{high rank variety},\n$\\tilde{X}$-quotient Reed-Muller codes inherit the distance and list-decoding\nparameters from the original Reed-Muller codes.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained traction for its success in solving\ncomplex tasks for robotic applications. However, its deployment on physical\nrobots remains challenging due to safety risks and the comparatively high costs\nof training. To avoid these problems, RL agents are often trained on\nsimulators, which introduces a new problem related to the gap between\nsimulation and reality. This paper presents an RL pipeline designed to help\nreduce the reality gap and facilitate developing and deploying RL policies for\nreal-world robotic systems. The pipeline organizes the RL training process into\nan initial step for system identification and three training stages: core\nsimulation training, high-fidelity simulation, and real-world deployment, each\nadding levels of realism to reduce the sim-to-real gap. Each training stage\ntakes an input policy, improves it, and either passes the improved policy to\nthe next stage or loops it back for further improvement. This iterative process\ncontinues until the policy achieves the desired performance. The pipeline's\neffectiveness is shown through a case study with the Boston Dynamics Spot\nmobile robot used in a surveillance application. The case study presents the\nsteps taken at each pipeline stage to obtain an RL agent to control the robot's\nposition and orientation.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), which estimate the full posterior\ndistribution over model parameters, are well-known for their role in\nuncertainty quantification and its promising application in out-of-distribution\ndetection (OoD). Amongst other uncertainty measures, BNNs provide a\nstate-of-the art estimation of predictive entropy (total uncertainty) which can\nbe decomposed as the sum of mutual information and expected entropy. In the\ncontext of OoD detection the estimation of predictive uncertainty in the form\nof the predictive entropy score confounds aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty,\nthe latter being hypothesized to be high for OoD points. Despite these\njustifications, the mutual information score has been shown to perform worse\nthan predictive entropy. Taking inspiration from Bayesian variational\nautoencoder (BVAE) literature, this work proposes to measure the disagreement\nbetween a corrected version of the pre-softmax quantities, otherwise known as\nlogits, as an estimate of epistemic uncertainty for Bayesian NNs under mean\nfield variational inference. The three proposed epistemic uncertainty scores\ndemonstrate marked improvements over mutual information on a range of OoD\nexperiments, with equal performance otherwise. Moreover, the epistemic\nuncertainty scores perform on par with the Bayesian benchmark predictive\nentropy on a range of MNIST and CIFAR10 experiments.",

Previous\nworks identified a new parameter in this sensor, called the Node Removal\nInefficiency (NRI), related to inefficiencies in charge transfer and residual\ncharge removal from the output gates after readout. These inefficiencies can\nlead to distortions in the measured signals similar to those produced by the\ncharge transfer inefficiencies in standard CCDs.

Therefore, the\ndevelopment of a multi-lane dataset and benchmark is necessary. While recent\nsynthetic scene-based NVS datasets have been prepared for cross-lane\nbenchmarking, they still lack the realism of captured images and point clouds.\nTo further assess the performance of existing methods based on NeRF and 3DGS,\nwe present the first multi-lane dataset registering parallel scans specifically\nfor novel driving view synthesis dataset derived from real-world scans,\ncomprising 25 groups of associated sequences, including 16,000 front-view\nimages, 64,000 surround-view images, and 16,000 LiDAR frames. All frames are\nlabeled to differentiate moving objects from static elements. Using this\ndataset, we evaluate the performance of existing approaches in various testing\nscenarios at different lanes and distances. Additionally, our method provides\nthe solution for solving and assessing the quality of multi-sensor poses for\nmulti-modal data alignment for curating such a dataset in real-world.

    "abstract": "Flexible cognition demands discovering hidden rules to quickly adapt\nstimulus-response mappings. Standard neural networks struggle in such tasks\nrequiring rapid, context-driven remapping. Recently, Hummos (2023) introduced a\nfast-and-slow learning algorithm to mitigate this shortcoming, but its\nscalability to complex, image-computable tasks was unclear. Here, we propose\nthe Wisconsin Neural Network (WiNN), which extends Hummos' fast-and-slow\nlearning to image-computable tasks demanding flexible rule-based behavior. WiNN\nemploys a pretrained convolutional neural network for vision, coupled with an\nadjustable \"context state\" that guides attention to relevant features. If WiNN\nproduces an incorrect response, it first iteratively updates its context state\nto refocus attention on task-relevant cues, then performs minimal parameter\nupdates to attention and readout layers. This strategy preserves generalizable\nrepresentations in the sensory and attention networks, reducing catastrophic\nforgetting. We evaluate WiNN on an image-based extension of the Wisconsin Card\nSorting Task, revealing several markers of cognitive flexibility: (i) WiNN\nautonomously infers underlying rules, (ii) requires fewer examples to do so\nthan control models reliant on large-scale parameter updates, (iii) can perform\ncontext-based rule inference solely via context-state adjustments-further\nenhanced by slow updates of attention and readout parameters, and (iv)\ngeneralizes to unseen compositional rules through context-state updates alone.\nBy blending fast context inference with targeted attentional guidance, WiNN\nachieves \"sparks\" of flexibility. This approach offers a path toward\ncontext-sensitive models that retain knowledge while rapidly adapting to\ncomplex, rule-based tasks.",

However, previous GS-based methods primarily\ntarget indoor scenes and rely on RGB-D sensors or pre-trained depth estimation\nmodels, hence underperforming in outdoor scenarios. To address this issue, we\npropose a RGB-only gaussian splatting SLAM method for unbounded outdoor\nscenes--OpenGS-SLAM. Technically, we first employ a pointmap regression network\nto generate consistent pointmaps between frames for pose estimation. Compared\nto commonly used depth maps, pointmaps include spatial relationships and scene\ngeometry across multiple views, enabling robust camera pose estimation. Then,\nwe propose integrating the estimated camera poses with 3DGS rendering as an\nend-to-end differentiable pipeline. Our method achieves simultaneous\noptimization of camera poses and 3DGS scene parameters, significantly enhancing\nsystem tracking accuracy. Specifically, we also design an adaptive scale mapper\nfor the pointmap regression network, which provides more accurate pointmap\nmapping to the 3DGS map representation. Our experiments on the Waymo dataset\ndemonstrate that OpenGS-SLAM reduces tracking error to 9.8\\% of previous 3DGS\nmethods, and achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis.

    "abstract": "Person identification is important for smart buildings to provide\npersonalized services such as health monitoring, activity tracking, and\npersonnel management. However, previous person identification relies on\npre-collected data from everyone, which is impractical in many buildings and\npublic facilities in which visitors are typically expected. This calls for a\ncontinual person identification system that gradually learns people's\nidentities on the fly. Existing studies use cameras to achieve this goal, but\nthey require direct line-of-sight and also have raised privacy concerns in\npublic. Other modalities such as wearables and pressure mats are limited by the\nrequirement of device-carrying or dense deployment. Thus, prior studies\nintroduced footstep-induced structural vibration sensing, which is\nnon-intrusive and perceived as more privacy-friendly. However, this approach\nhas a significant challenge: the high variability of vibration data due to\nstructural heterogeneity and human gait variations, which makes online person\nidentification algorithms perform poorly. In this paper, we characterize the\nvariability in footstep-induced structural vibration data for accurate online\nperson identification. To achieve this, we quantify and decompose different\nsources of variability and then design a feature transformation function to\nreduce the variability within each person's data to make different people's\ndata more separable.

In particular, when comparing models across\ngenerations, it is unclear whether improved performance results from longer\nreasoning chains or more efficient reasoning. We systematically analyze\nchain-of-thought length across o1-mini and o3-mini variants on the Omni-MATH\nbenchmark, finding that o3-mini (m) achieves superior accuracy without\nrequiring longer reasoning chains than o1-mini. Moreover, we show that accuracy\ngenerally declines as reasoning chains grow across all models and compute\nsettings, even when controlling for difficulty of the questions. This accuracy\ndrop is significantly smaller in more proficient models, suggesting that new\ngenerations of reasoning models use test-time compute more effectively.\nFinally, we highlight that while o3-mini (h) achieves a marginal accuracy gain\nover o3-mini (m), it does so by allocating substantially more reasoning tokens\nacross all problems, even the ones that o3-mini (m) can already solve.

Interestingly, for certain fundamental two-party functions,\nsuch as the inner product and Hamming distance, the accuracy of distributed\nsolutions significantly lags behind what can be achieved in the centralized\nmodel. For computational differential privacy, however, these limitations can\nbe circumvented using oblivious transfer (used to implement secure multi-party\ncomputation). Yet, no results show that oblivious transfer is indeed necessary\nfor accurately estimating a non-Boolean functionality. In particular, for the\ninner-product functionality, it was previously unknown whether oblivious\ntransfer is necessary even for the best possible constant additive error.\n  In this work, we prove that any computationally differentially private\nprotocol that estimates the inner product over $\\{-1,1\\}^n \\times \\{-1,1\\}^n$\nup to an additive error of $O(n^{1/6})$, can be used to construct oblivious\ntransfer.

    "abstract": "Research in AI evaluation has grown increasingly complex and\nmultidisciplinary, attracting researchers with diverse backgrounds and\nobjectives. As a result, divergent evaluation paradigms have emerged, often\ndeveloping in isolation, adopting conflicting terminologies, and overlooking\neach other's contributions. This fragmentation has led to insular research\ntrajectories and communication barriers both among different paradigms and with\nthe general public, contributing to unmet expectations for deployed AI systems.\nTo help bridge this insularity, in this paper we survey recent work in the AI\nevaluation landscape and identify six main paradigms. We characterise major\nrecent contributions within each paradigm across key dimensions related to\ntheir goals, methodologies and research cultures. By clarifying the unique\ncombination of questions and approaches associated with each paradigm, we aim\nto increase awareness of the breadth of current evaluation approaches and\nfoster cross-pollination between different paradigms.

    "abstract": "We introduce Probe Pruning (PP), a novel framework for online, dynamic,\nstructured pruning of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied in a batch-wise\nmanner. PP leverages the insight that not all samples and tokens contribute\nequally to the model's output, and probing a small portion of each batch\neffectively identifies crucial weights, enabling tailored dynamic pruning for\ndifferent batches. It comprises three main stages: probing, history-informed\npruning, and full inference. In the probing stage, PP selects a small yet\ncrucial set of hidden states, based on residual importance, to run a few model\nlayers ahead. During the history-informed pruning stage, PP strategically\nintegrates the probing states with historical states. Subsequently, it\nstructurally prunes weights based on the integrated states and the PP\nimportance score, a metric developed specifically to assess the importance of\neach weight channel in maintaining performance. In the final stage, full\ninference is conducted on the remaining weights. A major advantage of PP is its\ncompatibility with existing models, as it operates without requiring additional\nneural network modules or fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations of PP on\nLLaMA-2/3 and OPT models reveal that even minimal probing-using just 1.5% of\nFLOPs-can substantially enhance the efficiency of structured pruning of LLMs.\nFor instance, when evaluated on LLaMA-2-7B with WikiText2, PP achieves a 2.56\ntimes lower ratio of performance degradation per unit of runtime reduction\ncompared to the state-of-the-art method at a 40% pruning ratio.

In this\nwork, we analyse the quantum state update rule in these models and argue that\nincompatibility -- or, equivalently, order-dependent theoretical predictions of\nsequential measurements -- is sufficient to stop them from being able to\nadequately represent a scenario. This is because, as we argue, the quantum\nstate update rule requires ontological models to update their states according\nto conditional probability, which in turn renders predictions of sequential\nmeasurements order-independent. This implies that ontological models, even\ncontextual ones, must either act differently to what we would expect given the\nquantum state update rule, or cannot model quantum behaviour.

This constraint imposes high\nretraining or fine-tuning costs, especially for imitation learning-based\napproaches, when adapting to new end-effectors. To mitigate this issue, we\npresent a diffusion-based policy with a hybrid learning-optimization framework,\nenabling zero-shot adaptation to novel grippers without additional data\ncollection for retraining policy. During training, the policy learns\nmanipulation primitives from demonstrations collected using a base gripper. At\ninference, a diffusion-based optimization strategy dynamically enforces\nkinematic and safety constraints, ensuring that generated trajectories align\nwith the physical properties of unseen grippers. This is achieved through a\nconstrained denoising procedure that adapts trajectories to gripper-specific\nparameters (e.g., tool-center-point offsets, jaw widths) while preserving\ncollision avoidance and task feasibility. We validate our method on a Franka\nPanda robot across six gripper configurations, including 3D-printed fingertips,\nflexible silicone gripper, and Robotiq 2F-85 gripper. Our approach achieves a\n93.3% average task success rate across grippers (vs. 23.3-26.7% for diffusion\npolicy baselines), supporting tool-center-point variations of 16-23.5 cm and\njaw widths of 7.5-11.5 cm.

We give a complete list of\ntwo-dimensional models that exhibit altermagnetism classified by their\ncorresponding layer groups. Specifically, we calculate the local density of\nstates in the vicinity of pointlike nonmagnetic impurities and expose its\nspatial dependence for two minimal models showcasing $d$-wave and $g$-wave\naltermagnetism. The momentum structure of the nodes ($d$-wave, $g$-wave, etc.)\nis directly imprinted on the total local density of states, thus measurable by\nscanning tunneling conductance experiments. This signature is present both in\nthe spin-resolved as well as the spin-summed local density of states. We find a\nweaker response in the nonmagnetic state from the anisotropic crystal\nenvironment and uncover the importance of the sublattice degree of freedom to\nmodel altermagnets. We also study coexistence phases of altermagnetism and\nsuperconductivity and provide predictions for the local impurity response of\nin-gap bound states.

Defenses from\na representation perspective offer new insights, but existing interventions\ncannot dynamically adjust representations based on the harmfulness of the\nqueries. To address this limitation, we propose SafeIntervention (SafeInt), a\nnovel defense method that shields LLMs from jailbreak attacks through\nsafety-aware representation intervention. Built on our analysis of the\nrepresentations of jailbreak samples, the core idea of SafeInt is to relocate\njailbreak-related representations into the rejection region. This is achieved\nby intervening in the representation distributions of jailbreak samples to\nalign them with those of unsafe samples. We conduct comprehensive experiments\ncovering six jailbreak attacks, two jailbreak datasets, and two utility\nbenchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SafeInt outperforms all\nbaselines in defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks while largely maintaining\nutility.

Much effort is being\nmade to identify ASD biomarkers using various connectome-based machine learning\nand deep learning classifiers. However, correlation-based models cannot capture\nthe non-linear interactions between brain regions. To solve this problem, we\nintroduce a causality-inspired deep learning model that uses time-series\ninformation from fMRI and captures causality among ROIs useful for ASD\nclassification. The model is compared with other baseline and state-of-the-art\nmodels with 5-fold cross-validation on the ABIDE dataset. We filtered the\ndataset by choosing all the images with mean FD less than 15mm to ensure data\nquality. Our proposed model achieved the highest average classification\naccuracy of 71.9% and an average AUC of 75.8%. Moreover, the inter-ROI\ncausality interpretation of the model suggests that the left precuneus, right\nprecuneus, and cerebellum are placed in the top 10 ROIs in inter-ROI causality\namong the ASD population.

    "abstract": "Long-context modelling for large language models (LLMs) has been a key area\nof recent research because many real world use cases require reasoning over\nlonger inputs such as documents. The focus of research into modelling long\ncontext has been on how to model position and there has been little\ninvestigation into other important aspects of language modelling such as\ninstruction tuning. Long context training examples are challenging and\nexpensive to create and use. In this paper, we investigate how to design\ninstruction data for the post-training phase of a long context pre-trained\nmodel: how much and what type of context is needed for optimal and efficient\npost-training. Our controlled study reveals that models instruction-tuned on\nshort contexts can effectively generalize to longer ones, while also\nidentifying other critical factors such as instruction difficulty and context\ncomposition. Based on these findings, we propose context synthesis, a novel\ndata synthesis framework that leverages off-the-shelf LLMs to generate extended\nbackground contexts for high-quality instruction-answer pairs. Experiment\nresults on the document-level benchmark (LongBench) demonstrate that our\nproposed approach outperforms previous instruction synthesis approaches and\ncomes close to the performance of human-annotated long-context instruction\ndata.

    "abstract": "This thesis presents a framework that integrates state-of-the-art generative\nAI models for real-time creation of three-dimensional (3D) objects in augmented\nreality (AR) environments. The primary goal is to convert diverse inputs, such\nas images and speech, into accurate 3D models, enhancing user interaction and\nimmersion. Key components include advanced object detection algorithms,\nuser-friendly interaction techniques, and robust AI models like Shap-E for 3D\ngeneration. Leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models\n(LLMs), the system captures spatial details from images and processes textual\ninformation to generate comprehensive 3D objects, seamlessly integrating\nvirtual objects into real-world environments. The framework demonstrates\napplications across industries such as gaming, education, retail, and interior\ndesign. It allows players to create personalized in-game assets, customers to\nsee products in their environments before purchase, and designers to convert\nreal-world objects into 3D models for real-time visualization. A significant\ncontribution is democratizing 3D model creation, making advanced AI tools\naccessible to a broader audience, fostering creativity and innovation. The\nframework addresses challenges like handling multilingual inputs, diverse\nvisual data, and complex environments, improving object detection and model\ngeneration accuracy, as well as loading 3D models in AR space in real-time. In\nconclusion, this thesis integrates generative AI and AR for efficient 3D model\ngeneration, enhancing accessibility and paving the way for innovative\napplications and improved user interactions in AR environments.",

    "abstract": "Accurate interpolation of functions and derivatives is crucial in solving\npartial differential equations (PDEs). The Radial Basis Function (RBF) method\nhas become an extremely popular and robust approach for interpolation on\nscattered data. Hermite Radial Basis Function (HRBF) methods are an extension\nof the RBF and improve the overall accuracy by incorporating both function and\nderivative information. Infinitely smooth kernels, such as the Gaussian, use a\nshape-parameter to describe the width of support and are widely used due to\ntheir excellent approximation accuracy and ability to capture fine-scale\ndetails. Unfortunately, the use of infinitely smooth kernels suffers from\nill-conditioning at low to moderate shape parameters, which affects the\naccuracy. This work proposes a Modified HRBF (MHRBF) method that introduces an\nadditional polynomial term to balance kernel behavior, improving accuracy while\nmaintaining or lowering computational cost. Using standard double-precision\nmathematics, the results indicate that compared to the HRBF method, the MHRBF\nmethod achieves lower error for all values of the shape parameter and domain\nsize. The MHRBF is also able to achieve low errors at a lower computational\ncost as compared to the standard HRBF method.",

Towards characterising the history\nof the Hubble sequence, we perform a preliminary morphological analysis of 2445\nand 12,786 galaxies with $I_E < 21$ and $I_E < 23$, respectively. We use\nsingle-S\\'ersic profiles and the sums of a S\\'ersic bulge and an exponential\ndisc to model these galaxies with SourceXtractor++ and analyse their parameters\nin order to assess their consistencies and biases. The fitted galaxies to $I_E\n< 21$ span the various Hubble types with ubiquitous bulge and disc components,\nand a bulge-to-total light ratio B/T taking all values from 0 to 1. The median\neffective radius of the single-S\\'ersic profile is a biased estimate of galaxy\nsize, intermediate between the bulge and disc effective radii, depending on\nB/T. The axis ratio of the single-S\\'ersic profile overestimates that of the\ndisc, increasingly so with B/T. The model impacts the photometry with -0.08 to\n0.01 mag median systematic $I_E$ offsets between single-S\\'ersic and bulge+disc\ntotal magnitudes, and a 0.05 to 0.15 mag dispersion, from low to high B/T. We\nmeasure a median 0.4 mag bulge-disc colour difference in $I_E - J_E$ that\noriginates from the disc-dominated galaxies, whereas bulge-dominated galaxies\nhave similar median colours of their components. Remarkably, we also measure\nredder-inside disc colour gradients, based on 5 to 10% systematic variations of\ndisc effective radii between the optical and near-IR bands. This analysis\ndemonstrates the usefulness and limits of single-S\\'ersic profile modelling,\nand the power of bulge-disc decomposition for reliably characterising the\nmorphology of lenticulars and spirals in Euclid images.",

Noncausal processes, such as\nthe ''Lugano (AF/BW) process'', violate causal inequalities, yet their physical\nrealizability remains an open question. In contrast, the quantum switch - a\nphysically realizable process with indefinite causal order - can only generate\ncausal correlations. Building on a recently established equivalence [Kunjwal\nand Baumeler, PRL 131, 120201 (2023)] between the SHIFT measurement, which\nexhibits nonlocality without entanglement, and the Lugano process, we\ndemonstrate that the SHIFT measurement can be implemented using a quantum\nswitch of classical communications in a scenario with quantum inputs. This\nshows that the structure of the Lugano process can be simulated by a quantum\nswitch and that successful SHIFT discrimination witnesses causal\nnonseparability rather than noncausality, refuting prior claims. Finally, we\nidentify a broad class of ''superposition of classical communications'' derived\nfrom classical processes without global past capable of realizing similar\ncausally indefinite measurements. We examine these results in relation to the\nongoing debate on implementations of indefinite causal orders.",

Unlike traditional fault\nattacks that operate during module runtime, FLARE injects faults in the\nbitstream during its reconfiguration, altering the configuration address and\nredirecting it to unintended partial reconfigurable regions (PRRs). This\nenables the overwriting of pre-configured co-tenant modules, disrupting their\nfunctionality. FLARE leverages power-wasters that activate briefly during the\nreconfiguration process, making the attack stealthy and more challenging to\ndetect with existing countermeasures.

Although sparse autoencoders (SAEs)\nhave shown promise for interpreting LLM internal representations, limited\nresearch has explored how to better explain SAE features, i.e., understanding\nthe semantic meaning of features learned by SAE. Our theoretical analysis\nreveals that existing explanation methods suffer from the frequency bias issue,\nwhere they emphasize linguistic patterns over semantic concepts, while the\nlatter is more critical to steer LLM behaviors. To address this, we propose\nusing a fixed vocabulary set for feature interpretations and designing a mutual\ninformation-based objective, aiming to better capture the semantic meaning\nbehind these features.

Depending on the order in\nwhich the parameters are chosen, this naturally defines two games, a weak\nversion and a strong version (in which the cops are more powerful), and thus\ntwo variants of the cop number of a graph $G$: the weak cop number and the\nstrong cop number. It turns out that these two parameters are invariant under\nquasi-isometry and thus we can investigate these parameters in finitely\ngenerated groups by considering any of their Cayley graphs; the parameters do\nnot depend on the chosen set of generators.\n  We answer a number of questions raised by Lee, Mart\\'inez-Pedroza, and\nRodr\\'iguez-Quinche, and more recently by Cornect and Mart\\'inez-Pedroza. This\nincludes a proof that the weak and strong cop numbers are monotone under\nquasi-isometric embedding, characterizations of graphs of weak cop number 1 and\ngraphs of strong cop number 1, and a proof that the grid has infinite strong\ncop number.

This study investigates these evolutions over a\nbroad redshift range ($1 < z \\lesssim 6$), using a sample of 222 SMGs with a\nmedian redshift of $z = 2.61^{+0.89}_{-0.82}$ identified by ALMA and JCMT,\nenhanced by the advanced imaging capabilities of the JWST/NIRCam and MIRI. We\nfind significant evolution in effective radii ($R_e$) in rest-frame V-band\n($R_e \\propto (1 + z)^{-0.87 \\pm 0.08}$) and near-infrared (NIR) band ($R_e\n\\propto (1 + z)^{-0.88 \\pm 0.11}$), with the NIR size evolution resembling that\nof massive star-forming galaxies at lower redshift. Visual inspections reveal a\nmajor merger fraction of $24.3 \\pm 3.7\\%$ and an interaction fraction of up to\n$48.4 \\pm 11.1\\%$. The major merger fraction exhibits an increase from\n14.7$\\pm9.1$\\% at $z = 1$ to 26.6$\\pm 8.4$\\% at $z = 3$, after which it remains\napproximately constant across the redshift range $3 < z < 6$. In contrast, the\ninteraction fraction remains relatively stable across the range $2 < z < 5$.\nOur results indicate that late-stage major mergers are not the primary\nformation mechanism for SMGs at $z<3$, while interactions appear to play a\nsignificant role across the broader redshift range of $1<z<6$. Additionally,\nHST-based major merger identifications may overestimate the true fraction by a\nfactor of 1.7 at $z \\sim 2$. These findings highlight the varying roles of\nmergers and interactions in driving the formation of massive, dusty\nstar-forming galaxies across different redshifts.",

    "abstract": "Diverse formation channels have been proposed to explain the emergence of\nfast radio bursts (FRBs), yet their origin remains elusive. With improved\nlocalization precision, roughly 90 FRBs are now associated with host galaxies.\nSED fitting to the host galaxy photometry reveals their stellar masses\n($M_\\star$) and star formation rates (SFRs), enabling discrimination between\nvarious formation channels. We conduct an extensive comparison of the stellar\nmass, SFR and z distributions of 51 FRB hosts and mock-generated galaxy samples\nto test whether FRBs trace SFR or $M_\\star$. We incorporate a mass-to-light\nratio prescription to address optical selection biases. In line with Sharma et\nal. (2024), we provide evidence in favor of FRB progenitors tracking SF rather\nthan stellar mass. We show that the shape of the assumed $(M_\\star/L_r)_{obs}$\ndistribution affects the predictions, bringing the low mass end of the stellar\nmass distribution closer to the data when accounting for the $\\mathrm{SFR} -\n(M_\\star/L_r)_{obs}$ correlation. The K-correction effect in the $r-$band is\nminimal for galaxies at $z \\lesssim 0.7$. Even if FRBs trace SF, up to $\\sim\n6\\%$ of a flux-limited FRB host sample can reside below the star-forming main\nsequence. Finally, we examine a hybrid model in which a fraction of FRBs tracks\nstellar mass rather than SF. This fraction can be as large as $\\sim(40-50)\\%$,\nsuggesting that multiple formation channels are still consistent with\nobservations. The toolkit developed in this work is publicly available (GALFRB\ncode), offering a straightforward way to generate mock galaxy samples suitable\nfor direct comparisons with future FRB host galaxy data.",

A DMA is a thin\nstructure patterned on its front with reconfigurable radiating metamaterial\nelements (meta-atoms) that are excited by waveguides or cavities. Mutual\ncoupling between the meta-atoms can result in a strongly non-linear dependence\nof the DMA's radiation pattern on the configuration of its meta-atoms. However,\nbesides the obvious algorithmic challenges of working with physics-compliant\nDMA models, it remains unclear how mutual coupling in DMAs influences the\nability to achieve a desired wireless functionality. In this paper, we provide\ntheoretical, numerical and experimental evidence that strong mutual coupling in\nDMAs increases the radiation pattern sensitivity to the DMA configuration and\nthereby boosts the available control over the radiation pattern, improving the\nability to tailor the radiation pattern to the requirements of a desired\nwireless functionality. Counterintuitively, we hence encourage next-generation\nDMA implementations to enhance (rather than suppress) mutual coupling, in\ncombination with suitable physics-compliant modeling and optimization.

Consequently, many hypergraph\nrepresentation learning methods have emerged to model the complex relationships\namong hypergraphs. In general, these methods leverage classic expansion methods\nto convert hypergraphs into weighted or bipartite graphs, and further employ\nmessage passing mechanisms to model the complex structures within hypergraphs.\nHowever, classical expansion methods are designed in straightforward manners\nwith fixed edge weights, resulting in information loss or redundancy. In light\nof this, we design a novel clique expansion-based Adaptive Expansion method\ncalled AdE to adaptively expand hypergraphs into weighted graphs that preserve\nthe higher-order structure information. Specifically, we introduce a novel\nGlobal Simulation Network to select two representative nodes for adaptively\nsymbolizing each hyperedge and connect the rest of the nodes within the same\nhyperedge to the corresponding selected nodes. Afterward, we design a\ndistance-aware kernel function, dynamically adjusting edge weights to ensure\nsimilar nodes within a hyperedge are connected with larger weights. Extensive\ntheoretical justifications and empirical experiments over seven benchmark\nhypergraph datasets demonstrate that AdE has excellent rationality,\ngeneralization, and effectiveness compared to classic expansion models.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a control design methodology, stability criteria,\nand performance bounds for autonomous helicopter aerial refueling. Autonomous\naerial refueling is particularly difficult due to the aerodynamic interaction\nbetween the wake of the tanker, the contact-sensitive nature of the maneuver,\nand the uncertainty in drogue motion. Since the probe tip is located\nsignificantly away from the helicopter's center-of-gravity, its position (and\nvelocity) is strongly sensitive to the helicopter's attitude (and angular\nrates). In addition, the fact that the helicopter is operating at high speeds\nto match the velocity of the tanker forces it to maintain a particular\norientation, making the docking maneuver especially challenging. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel outer-loop position controller that incorporates the probe\nposition and velocity into the feedback loop. The position and velocity of the\nprobe tip depend both on the position (velocity) and on the attitude (angular\nrates) of the aircraft. We derive analytical guarantees for docking performance\nin terms of the uncertainty of the drogue motion and the angular acceleration\nof the helicopter, using the ultimate boundedness property of the closed-loop\nerror dynamics. Simulations are performed on a high-fidelity UH60 helicopter\nmodel with a high-fidelity drogue motion under wind effects to validate the\nproposed approach for realistic refueling scenarios. These high-fidelity\nsimulations reveal that the proposed control methodology yields an improvement\nof 36% in the 2-norm docking error compared to the existing standard\ncontroller.",

    "abstract": "The mass function (MF) of young ($\\mathrm{age\\lesssim 200}$ Myr) stellar\nclumps is an indicator of the mechanism driving the collapse of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) into giant molecular clouds. Typically, the clump MF\nin main-sequence galaxies is described by a power law ($dN/dM_*\\propto\nM_*^{-\\alpha}$) with slope $\\alpha=2$, hinting a turbulence-driven collapse. To\nunderstand whether the local environment affects star formation, we have\nmodelled the clump MF of six cluster galaxies from the GASP survey, undergoing\nstrong ram-pressure stripping. This process, exerted by the hot and\nhigh-pressure intra-cluster medium (ICM), has produced long tails of stripped\nISM where clumps form far away from the galactic disk and surrounded by the ICM\nitself. Clumps were selected from HST-UVIS/WFC3 images, covering from near-UV\nto red-optical bands and including H$\\alpha$-line maps. The catalogue comprises\n398 H$\\alpha$ (188 in tails, 210 in disk outskirts, the so-called extraplanar\nregion) and 1270 UV clumps (593 tail, 677 extraplanar). Using mock images, we\nquantified the mass completeness and bias of our sample. Accounting for these\ntwo effects, we adopted a Bayesian approach to fit the clump mass catalogue to\na chosen function. The resulting MFs are steeper than expected. In the tails,\nthe H$\\alpha$ clumps have slope $\\alpha=2.31\\pm0.12$, while the UV slope is\nlarger ($2.60\\pm0.09$), in agreement with ageing effects. Similar results are\nfound in the extraplanar region, with H$\\alpha$ slope\n$\\alpha=2.45^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ and UV slope $\\alpha=2.63^{+0.20}_{-0.18}$, even\nif they are consistent within uncertainties. We suggest that the steepening\nresults from the higher-than-usual turbulent environment, arising from the\ninteraction between ISM and ICM. As shown by recent works, this process can\nfavour the fragmentation of the largest ISM clouds, inhibiting the formation of\nvery massive clumps.",

    "abstract": "Testing processes usually aim at high coverage, but loops severely limit\ncoverage ambitions since the number of iterations is generally not predictable.\nMost testing teams address this issue by adopting the extreme solution of\nlimiting themselves to branch coverage, which only considers loop executions\nthat iterate the body either once or not at all. This approach misses any bug\nthat only arises after two or more iterations.\n  To achieve more meaningful coverage, testing strategies may unroll loops, in\nthe sense of using executions that iterate loops up to n times for some n\ngreater than one, chosen pragmatically in consideration of the available\ncomputational power.\n  While loop unrolling is a standard part of compiler optimization techniques,\nits use in testing is far less common. Part of the reason is that the concept,\nwhile seemingly intuitive, lacks a generally accepted and precise\nspecification. The present article provides a formal definition and a set of\nformal properties of unrolling. All the properties have mechanically been\nproved correct (through the Isabelle proof assistant).\n  Using this definition as the conceptual basis, we have applied an unrolling\nstrategy to an existing automated testing framework and report the results: how\nmany more bugs get detected once we unroll loops more than once?\n  These results provide a first assessment of whether unrolling should become a\nstandard part of test generation and test coverage measurement.",

Because of the\nmetastability of the hexagonal-diamond phase, I$_3$-type basal stacking faults\nare frequently observed in these materials. Understanding and modulating the\ninteraction between these extended defects and dopants are essential for\nadvancing the design and performance of these novel semiconductors. In the\npresent study, we employ density functional theory calculations to investigate\nthe interaction of extrinsic dopants (group III, IV, and V elements) with the\nI$_3$-type basal stacking fault in hexagonal-diamond silicon. Contrary to the\nbehavior observed in cubic-diamond silicon with intrinsic stacking faults, we\ndemonstrate that neutral and negatively charged $p$-type impurities exhibit a\nmarked tendency to occupy lattice sites far from the I$_3$-type basal stacking\nfault. The interaction of acceptors with the planar defect reduces their\nenergetic stability. However, this effect is much less pronounced for neutral\nor positively charged $n$-type dopants and isovalent impurities. The\nthermodynamic energy barrier to segregation for these dopants is small and may\neven become negative, indicating a tendency to segregate into the fault.\nThrough a detailed analysis of structural modifications, ionization effects,\nand impurity-level charge density distribution, we show that the origin of this\nbehavior can be attributed to variations in the impurity's steric effects and\nits wave function character. Finally, all these results are validated by\nconsidering the extreme case of an abrupt hexagonal/cubic silicon interface,\nwhere acceptor segregation from the cubic to the hexagonal region is\ndemonstrated, confirming the behavior observed for $p$-type dopants near the\nI$_3$-type defect.",

    "abstract": "With the surge in number of large language models (LLMs), the industry turns\nto serverless computing for LLM inference serving. However, serverless LLM\nserving suffers from significant cold start latency and service level objective\n(SLO) violations due to the substantial model size, which leads to prolonged\nmodel fetching time from remote storage. We present ParaServe, a serverless LLM\nserving system that minimizes cold start latency through the novel use of\npipeline parallelism. Our insight is that by distributing model parameters\nacross multiple GPU servers, we can utilize their aggregated network bandwidth\nto concurrently fetch different parts of the model. ParaServe adopts a\ntwo-level hierarchical design. At the cluster level, ParaServe determines the\noptimal degree of parallelism based on user SLOs and carefully places GPU\nworkers across servers to reduce network interference. At the worker level,\nParaServe overlaps model fetching, loading, and runtime initialization to\nfurther accelerate cold starts. Additionally, ParaServe introduces pipeline\nconsolidation, which merges parallel groups back to individual workers to\nmaintain optimal performance for warm requests. Our comprehensive evaluations\nunder diverse settings demonstrate that ParaServe reduces the cold start\nlatency by up to 4.7x and improves SLO attainment by up to 1.74x compared to\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "With the application of advanced science and technology in the military\nfield, modern warfare has developed into a confrontation between systems. The\ncombat system-of-systems (CSoS) has numerous nodes, multiple attributes and\ncomplex interactions, and its research and analysis are facing great\ndifficulties. Electromagnetic space is an important dimension of modern\nwarfare. Modeling and analyzing the CSoS from this perspective is of great\nsignificance to studying modern warfare and can provide a reference for the\nresearch of electromagnetic warfare. In this study, the types of nodes and\nrelationships in the complex electromagnetic space of CSoS are first divided,\nthe important attributes of the combat nodes are extracted, and the\nrelationship weights are normalized to establish a networked model. On this\nbasis, the calculation method of CSoS combat effectiveness based on the combat\ncycle is proposed, and then the identification and sorting of key nodes can be\nrealized by the node deletion method. Finally, by constructing an instance of\naircraft carrier fleet confrontation, the feasibility of this method has been\nverified, and the experimental results have been compared with classical\nalgorithms to demonstrate the advanced nature of this method.",

However,\ntraditional ANNs often struggle to align with brain regions due to their\nexcessive depth and lack of biologically realistic features, like recurrent\nconnection. To address this, a brain-like auditory network (BAN) is introduced,\nwhich incorporates four neuroanatomically mapped areas and recurrent\nconnection, guided by a novel metric called the brain-like auditory score\n(BAS). BAS serves as a benchmark for evaluating the similarity between BAN and\nhuman auditory recognition pathway. We further propose that specific areas in\nthe cerebral cortex, mainly the middle and medial superior temporal (T2/T3)\nareas, correspond to the designed network structure, drawing parallels with the\nbrain's auditory perception pathway. Our findings suggest that the\nneuroanatomical similarity in the cortex and auditory classification abilities\nof the ANN are well-aligned.

    "abstract": "In the field of affective computing, traditional methods for generating\nemotions predominantly rely on deep learning techniques and large-scale emotion\ndatasets. However, deep learning techniques are often complex and difficult to\ninterpret, and standardizing large-scale emotional datasets are difficult and\ncostly to establish. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel framework\nnamed Audio-Visual Fusion for Brain-like Emotion Learning(AVF-BEL). In contrast\nto conventional brain-inspired emotion learning methods, this approach improves\nthe audio-visual emotion fusion and generation model through the integration of\nmodular components, thereby enabling more lightweight and interpretable emotion\nlearning and generation processes. The framework simulates the integration of\nthe visual, auditory, and emotional pathways of the brain, optimizes the fusion\nof emotional features across visual and auditory modalities, and improves upon\nthe traditional Brain Emotional Learning (BEL) model. The experimental results\nindicate a significant improvement in the similarity of the audio-visual fusion\nemotion learning generation model compared to single-modality visual and\nauditory emotion learning and generation model. Ultimately, this aligns with\nthe fundamental phenomenon of heightened emotion generation facilitated by the\nintegrated impact of visual and auditory stimuli. This contribution not only\nenhances the interpretability and efficiency of affective intelligence but also\nprovides new insights and pathways for advancing affective computing\ntechnology.

By redesigning the positional encoding module and introducing an\nadaptive quantization strategy, Q-PETR maintains floating-point performance\nwith a performance degradation of less than 1% under standard 8-bit per-tensor\npost-training quantization. Moreover, compared to its FP32 counterpart, Q-PETR\nachieves a two-fold speedup and reduces memory usage by three times, thereby\noffering a deployment-friendly solution for resource-constrained onboard\ndevices.

A linear\nrelationship was measured within the tumour margin region, with a Pearson\ncorrelation of 0.8. The downstream application was explored, comparing training\nusing confidence annotations as soft labels with using the best discrete\nannotations as hard labels. In all evaluation folds, the Brier score was\nsuperior for the soft-label trained network.

    "abstract": "Existing communication systems aim to reconstruct the information at the\nreceiver side, and are known as reconstruction-oriented communications. This\napproach often falls short in meeting the real-time, task-specific demands of\nmodern AI-driven applications such as autonomous driving and semantic\nsegmentation. As a new design principle, task-oriented communications have been\ndeveloped. However, it typically requires joint optimization of encoder,\ndecoder, and modified inference neural networks, resulting in extensive\ncross-system redesigns and compatibility issues. This paper proposes a novel\ncommunication framework that aligns reconstruction-oriented and task-oriented\ncommunications for edge intelligence. The idea is to extend the Information\nBottleneck (IB) theory to optimize data transmission by minimizing\ntask-relevant loss function, while maintaining the structure of the original\ndata by an information reshaper. Such an approach integrates task-oriented\ncommunications with reconstruction-oriented communications, where a variational\napproach is designed to handle the intractability of mutual information in\nhigh-dimensional neural network features. We also introduce a joint\nsource-channel coding (JSCC) modulation scheme compatible with classical\nmodulation techniques, enabling the deployment of AI technologies within\nexisting digital infrastructures. The proposed framework is particularly\neffective in edge-based autonomous driving scenarios. Our evaluation in the Car\nLearning to Act (CARLA) simulator demonstrates that the proposed framework\nsignificantly reduces bits per service by 99.19% compared to existing methods,\nsuch as JPEG, JPEG2000, and BPG, without compromising the effectiveness of task\nexecution.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for natural language\nunderstanding and text generation. An LLM model relies on a time-consuming step\ncalled LLM decoding to generate output tokens. Several prior works focus on\nimproving the performance of LLM decoding using parallelism techniques, such as\nbatching and speculative decoding. State-of-the-art LLM decoding has both\ncompute-bound and memory-bound kernels. Some prior works statically identify\nand map these different kernels to a heterogeneous architecture consisting of\nboth processing-in-memory (PIM) units and computation-centric accelerators. We\nobserve that characteristics of LLM decoding kernels (e.g., whether or not a\nkernel is memory-bound) can change dynamically due to parameter changes to meet\nuser and/or system demands, making (1) static kernel mapping to PIM units and\ncomputation-centric accelerators suboptimal, and (2) one-size-fits-all approach\nof designing PIM units inefficient due to a large degree of heterogeneity even\nin memory-bound kernels.\n  In this paper, we aim to accelerate LLM decoding while considering the\ndynamically changing characteristics of the kernels involved. We propose PAPI\n(PArallel Decoding with PIM), a PIM-enabled heterogeneous architecture that\nexploits dynamic scheduling of compute-bound or memory-bound kernels to\nsuitable hardware units. PAPI has two key mechanisms: (1) online kernel\ncharacterization to dynamically schedule kernels to the most suitable hardware\nunits at runtime and (2) a PIM-enabled heterogeneous computing system that\nharmoniously orchestrates both computation-centric processing units and hybrid\nPIM units with different computing capabilities. Our experimental results on\nthree broadly-used LLMs show that PAPI achieves 1.8$\\times$ and 11.1$\\times$\nspeedups over a state-of-the-art heterogeneous LLM accelerator and a\nstate-of-the-art PIM-only LLM accelerator, respectively.",

The\nmeson masses are determined by solving the Bethe-Salpter equation. An\ninteresting observation is the additional degeneracy in the chain-exchanging\nodd sectors. Beyond the two particle approximation, we exploit the truncated\nfree fermionic space approach to calculate the spectrum numerically.\nCorrections to the meson masses are obtained, and the degeneracy is further\nconfirmed. The characterization and degeneracy can be connected to the\nsituation when each chain is tuned to be quantum critical, where the system is\ndescribed by the Ising$_h^2$ integrable model, a sine-Gordon theory with\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold. Here we establish a clear correspondence between the\nparticles in the bosonized form and their fermionic counterparts.

Hence, we demonstrate that the gravitational theory under\nstudy admits a class of black hole solutions characterized by an inverse\npower-law correction to the Schwarzschild $g_{tt}$ metric function and a\nfirst-order perturbation of the $g_{rr}$ Schwarzschild component. Then, through\na stepwise methodology, we analytically solve the full dynamics of the theory,\nfinally leading to the reconstruction of the nonlocal distortion function,\nwithin which the new black hole solutions arise.

The Source Iteration (SI) method is the most standard iterative\nmethod for solving this system. In this paper, by introducing randomness into\nthe SI method, we propose a novel random source iteration (RSI) method that\noffers a new way to mitigate the ray effect without increasing the\ncomputational cost. We have rigorously proved that RSI is unbiased with respect\nto the SI method and that its variance is uniformly bounded across iteration\nsteps; thus, the convergence order with respect to the number of samples is\n$1/2$.

There are several\nserialized products such as the Digital Baseband Converter (DBBC),\nReconfigurable Open Architecture Computing Hardware (ROACH) Digital BackEnd\n(RDBE), and Chinese Data Acquisition System (CDAS). However, the reliance on\nhigh-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and Field Programmable Gate\nArrays (FPGAs) often necessitates dedicated hardware platforms with long\ndevelopment cycles and prohibitive cost, limiting scalability and adaptability\nto evolving observational needs. To address these challenges, we propose a\ndesign leveraging the versatile and cost-effective ROACH2 hardware platform,\ndeveloped by CASPER (Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and\nElectronics Research). ROACH2's mature technology and streamlined firmware\ndevelopment capabilities significantly reduce the hardware platform's\ndevelopment cycle and cost, making it ideal for modern astronomical\napplications. This VLBI digital backend, based on the ROACH2 platform,\nincorporates key technologies such as Polyphase Filter Banks (PFB) algorithm\nimplementation, digital complex-to-real baseband signal conversion, Mark5B data\nformatter design and two-bit optimal threshold quantization. These features\nensure compatibility with existing systems while providing enhanced\nperformance. The backend's performance was validated through multi-station VLBI\nexperiments, demonstrating its ability to achieve good correlation fringes\ncompared to the customized CDAS2-D system. Furthermore, this platform offers\nflexibility for rapid deployment of additional digital backends, such as those\nfor spectral line observations, showcasing its potential for broader\nastronomical applications.",

Here, we predict a\ntype of kagome superconductor, MPd5 (M is a group-IIA metal element), and\nidentify that it exhibits coexistence of superconductivity and nontrivial\ntopological properties. We uncover its phonon-mediated superconductivity by the\ndensity functional theory for superconductors, predicting the superconducting\ntransition temperatures (Tc) of 2.64, 2.03, and 1.50 K for CaPd5, SrPd5, and\nBaPd5, respectively. These Tc can be effectively tuned through the application\nof external pressure and electron doping. The present results also demonstrate\nthat MPd5 have topological properties; e.g., CaPd5 shows topological nontrivial\nintersection near the Fermi level (EF). Our results indicate that MPd5\nmaterials can be an emerging material platform with rich exotic physics in\ntheir kagome structures, and render themselves excellent candidates for\nsuperconducting and advanced functional materials that could be utilized in\ntopological quantum computing and information technology.",

A compression-aware quantization is first\nproposed to enhance model weight compressibility by re-scaling the model\nparameters before quantization, followed by a pruning method to improve\nfurther. Upon this, we notice that decompression can be a bottleneck during\npractical scenarios. We then give a detailed analysis of the trade-off between\nmemory usage and latency brought by the proposed method. A speed-adaptive\nmethod is proposed to overcome it.

The learning process often gets stuck in local optimum and\ndemands task-specific reward fine-tuning for complex scenarios. In this work,\nwe propose a structured framework that leverages privileged actions with\ncurriculum learning, enabling the policy to efficiently acquire long-horizon\nskills without relying on extensive reward engineering or reference\ntrajectories. Specifically, we use privileged actions in simulation with a\ngeneral training procedure that would be infeasible to implement in real-world\nscenarios. These privileges include relaxed constraints and virtual forces that\nenhance interaction and exploration with objects. Our results successfully\nachieve complex multi-stage long-horizon tasks that naturally combine\nnon-prehensile manipulation with grasping to lift objects from non-graspable\nposes.

    "abstract": "Declarative specifications have a vital role to play in developing safe and\ndependable software systems. Writing specifications correctly, however, remains\nparticularly challenging. This paper presents a controlled experiment on using\nlarge language models (LLMs) to write declarative formulas in the well-known\nlanguage Alloy. Our use of LLMs is three-fold. One, we employ LLMs to write\ncomplete Alloy formulas from given natural language descriptions (in English).\nTwo, we employ LLMs to create alternative but equivalent formulas in Alloy with\nrespect to given Alloy formulas. Three, we employ LLMs to complete sketches of\nAlloy formulas and populate the holes in the sketches by synthesizing Alloy\nexpressions and operators so that the completed formulas accurately represent\nthe desired properties (that are given in natural language). We conduct the\nexperimental evaluation using 11 well-studied subject specifications and employ\ntwo popular LLMs, namely ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The experimental results show\nthat the LLMs generally perform well in synthesizing complete Alloy formulas\nfrom input properties given in natural language or in Alloy, and are able to\nenumerate multiple unique solutions. Moreover, the LLMs are also successful at\ncompleting given sketches of Alloy formulas with respect to natural language\ndescriptions of desired properties (without requiring test cases). We believe\nLLMs offer a very exciting advance in our ability to write specifications, and\ncan help make specifications take a pivotal role in software development and\nenhance our ability to build robust software.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal ensemble activity, including coordinated and oscillatory patterns,\nexhibits hallmarks of nonequilibrium systems with time-asymmetric trajectories\nto maintain their organization. However, assessing time asymmetry from neuronal\nspiking activity remains challenging. The kinetic Ising model provides a\nframework for studying the causal, nonequilibrium dynamics in spiking recurrent\nneural networks. Recent theoretical advances in this model have enabled\ntime-asymmetry estimation from large-scale steady-state data. Yet, neuronal\nactivity often exhibits time-varying firing rates and coupling strengths,\nviolating steady-state assumption. To overcome these limitations, we developed\na state-space kinetic Ising model that accounts for non-stationary and\nnonequilibrium properties of neural systems. This approach incorporates a\nmean-field method for estimating time-varying entropy flow, a key measure for\nmaintaining the system's organization by dissipation. Applying this method to\nmouse visual cortex data revealed greater variability in causal couplings\nduring task engagement despite the reduced neuronal activity with increased\nsparsity. Moreover, higher-performing mice exhibited increased entropy flow in\nhigher-firing neurons during task engagement, suggesting that stronger directed\nactivity emerged in a fewer neurons within sparsely active populations. These\nfindings underscore the model's utility in uncovering intricate asymmetric\ncausal dynamics in neuronal ensembles and linking them to behavior through the\nthermodynamic underpinnings of neural computation.",

Existing solutions either incur prohibitively high\ncommunication cost that scales linearly with the number of clients or suffer\nfrom performance degradation due to limited expressivity. We introduce\nFederated Silver Bullet (Fed-SB), a novel approach for federated fine-tuning of\nLLMs using LoRA-SB, a recently proposed low-rank adaptation method. LoRA-SB\noptimally aligns the optimization trajectory with the ideal low-rank full\nfine-tuning projection by learning a small square matrix (R) between adapters B\nand A, keeping other components fixed. Direct averaging of R guarantees exact\nupdates, substantially reducing communication cost, which remains independent\nof the number of clients, and enables scalability. Fed-SB achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across commonsense reasoning, arithmetic\nreasoning, and language inference tasks while reducing communication costs by\nup to 230x. In private settings, Fed-SB further improves performance by (1)\nreducing trainable parameters, thereby lowering the noise required for\ndifferential privacy and (2) avoiding noise amplification introduced by other\nmethods. Overall, Fed-SB establishes a new Pareto frontier in the tradeoff\nbetween communication and performance, offering an efficient and scalable\nsolution for both private and non-private federated fine-tuning.

LHAASO J0341$+$5258 is one of\nthe unidentified ultra-high-energy (UHE; E $>$100 TeV) gamma-ray sources\ndetected by LHAASO. Our CO observations were conducted in February and March\n2024, with a total observation time of 36 hours, covering the LHAASO source\n($\\sim$0.3-0.5 degrees in radius) and its surrounding area (1$\\times$1.5\ndegrees). Within the LHAASO source extent, we identified five compact ($<$ 2\npc) molecular clouds at nearby distances ($<$ 1-4 kpc). These clouds can serve\nas proton-proton collision targets, producing hadronic gamma rays via neutral\npion decays. Based on the hydrogen densities (700-5000 cm$^{-3}$) estimated\nfrom our CO observations and archived HI data from the DRAO survey, we derived\nthe total proton energy of $W_p$ (E $>$ 1 TeV) $\\sim$ 10$^{45}$ erg to account\nfor the gamma-ray flux. One of the molecular clouds appears to be likely\nassociated with an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star with an extended CO tail,\nwhich may indicate some particle acceleration activities. However, the\nestimated maximum particle energy below 100 TeV makes the AGB-like star\nunlikely to be a PeVatron site. We conclude that the UHE emission observed in\nLHAASO J0341$+$5258 could be due to hadronic interactions between the newly\ndiscovered molecular clouds and TeV-PeV protons originating from a distant SNR\nor due to leptonic emission from a pulsar wind nebula candidate, which is\nreported in our companion X-ray observation paper (DiKerby et al. 2025).",

    "abstract": "Quantum computers can solve semidefinite programs (SDPs) using resources that\nscale better than state-of-the-art classical methods as a function of the\nproblem dimension. At the same time, the known quantum algorithms scale very\nunfavorably in the precision, which makes it non-trivial to find applications\nfor which the quantum methods are well-suited. Arguably, precision is less\ncrucial for SDP relaxations of combinatorial optimization problems (such as the\nGoemans-Williamson algorithm), because these include a final rounding step that\nmaps SDP solutions to binary variables. With this in mind, Brand\\~ao,\nFran\\c{c}a, and Kueng have proposed to use quantum SDP solvers in order to\nachieve an end-to-end speed-up for obtaining approximate solutions to\ncombinatorial optimization problems. They did indeed succeed in identifying an\nalgorithm that realizes a polynomial quantum advantage in terms of its\nasymptotic running time. However, asymptotic results say little about the\nproblem sizes for which advantages manifest. Here, we present an analysis of\nthe non-asymptotic resource requirements of this algorithm. The work consists\nof two parts. First, we optimize the original algorithm with a particular\nemphasis on performance for realistic problem instances. In particular, we\nformulate a version with adaptive step-sizes, an improved detection criterion\nfor infeasible instances, and a more efficient rounding procedure. In a second\nstep, we benchmark both the classical and the quantum version of the algorithm.\nThe benchmarks did not identify a regime where even the optimized quantum\nalgorithm would beat standard classical approaches for input sizes that can be\nrealistically solved at all. In the absence of further significant\nimprovements, these algorithms therefore fall into a category sometimes called\ngalactic: Unbeaten in their asymptotic scaling behavior, but not practical for\nrealistic problems.",

In this study, we present\nand analyze a fully automated pipeline for NF segmentation in fat-suppressed\nT2-weighted WB-MRI, consisting of three stages: anatomy segmentation, NF\nsegmentation, and tumor candidate classification. In the first stage, we use\nthe MRSegmentator model to generate an anatomy segmentation mask, extended with\na high-risk zone for NFs.

The second stage employs an\nensemble of 3D anisotropic anatomy-informed U-Nets to produce an NF\nsegmentation confidence mask.

These are bosonic counterpart of the\nfermionic Slater determinants, but with the significant distinction that the\nsingle-particle orbitals used to construct a permanent can be arbitrary and do\nnot need to be orthogonal to each other. Typically, the variational wave\nfunction may break the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, resulting in qualitative\nand quantitative errors in physical observables. A straightforward method to\nrestore symmetry is projection after variation, where we project the\nvariational wave function onto the desired symmetry sector. However, a more\neffective strategy is variation after projection, which involves first creating\na symmetry-adapted variational wave function and then optimizing its\nparameters. We have devised a scheme to realize this strategy and have tested\nit on various models with symmetry groups ranging from $\\mathbb{Z}_2$,\n$\\text{C}_L$, to $\\text{D}_L$. In all the models and symmetry sectors studied,\nthe variational wave function accurately estimates not only the energy of the\nlowest eigenstate but also the single-particle correlation function, as it\napproximate the target eigenstate very well on the wave function level. We have\napplied this method to study few-body bound states, superfluid fraction, and\nYrast lines of some Bose-Hubbard models. This approach should be valuable for\nstudying few-body or mesoscopic bosonic systems.",

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)\npractitioners rely on specific measures to gauge the quality of such\nexplanations. These measures assess key attributes, such as how closely an\nexplanation aligns with a model's decision process (faithfulness), how\naccurately it pinpoints the relevant input features (localization), and its\nconsistency across different cases (robustness). Despite providing valuable\ninformation, these measures do not fully address a critical practitioner's\nconcern: how does the quality of a given explanation compare to other potential\nexplanations? Traditionally, the quality of an explanation has been assessed by\ncomparing it to a randomly generated counterpart. This paper introduces an\nalternative: the Quality Gap Estimate (QGE). The QGE method offers a direct\ncomparison to what can be viewed as the `inverse' explanation, one that\nconceptually represents the antithesis of the original explanation. Our\nextensive testing across multiple model architectures, datasets, and\nestablished quality metrics demonstrates that the QGE method is superior to the\ntraditional approach.

    "abstract": "In this work we review the recent advances on superconducting phenomena in\njunctions formed by superconductors and unconventional magnets. Conventional\nmagnets, such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, are characterized by broken\ntime-reversal symmetry but only ferromagnets produce a finite net magnetization\ndue to parallel spin alignment and spin-split bands in momentum. Very recently,\na new type of magnets has been reported and here we refer to them as\nunconventional magnets because they exhibit special properties of both\nferromagnets and antiferromagnets: they exhibit zero net magnetization (like\nantiferromagnets) and a nonrelativistic spin splitting of energy bands (like\nferromagnets), both leading to anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces. An\ninteresting property of unconventional magnets is that their magnetic order can\nbe even or odd with respect to momentum, where $d$-wave altermagnets and\n$p$-wave magnets are the most representative examples. In this regard, $d$-wave\naltermagnets and $p$-wave magnets are seen as counterparts in magnetism of the\nunconventional $d$- and $p$-wave superconducting states, respectively. While\nthe impact of conventional magnetism on superconductivity has been largely\nstudied, the combination of unconventional magnets and superconductivity has\nonly lately attracted considerably attention. This work provides a\ncomprehensive review of the recent progress on the interplay between\nsuperconductivity and unconventional magnets. In particular, we focus on the\nfundamental emerging superconducting phenomena and also discuss the potential\nimplications towards quantum applications.",

The complexity of VMMR arises\nfrom the subtle visual distinctions among vehicle models and the wide variety\nof classes produced by manufacturers. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a\nprominent type of deep learning model, have been extensively employed in\nvarious computer vision tasks, including VMMR, yielding remarkable results. As\nVMMR is a fine-grained classification problem, it primarily faces inter-class\nsimilarity and intra-class variation challenges.

This module, which does not\nincrease the parameters of the original model, generates three-dimensional\n(3-D) attention weights to refine the feature map.

In this paper, we investigate the limitations of LMMs in\ngenerating long captions for long videos. Our analysis reveals that open-source\nLMMs struggle to consistently produce outputs exceeding 300 words, leading to\nincomplete or overly concise descriptions of the visual content. This\nlimitation hinders the ability of LMMs to provide comprehensive and detailed\ncaptions for long videos, ultimately missing important visual information.\nThrough controlled experiments, we find that the scarcity of paired examples\nwith long-captions during training is the primary factor limiting the model's\noutput length. However, manually annotating long-caption examples for long-form\nvideos is time-consuming and expensive. To overcome the annotation bottleneck,\nwe propose the LongCaption-Agent, a framework that synthesizes long caption\ndata by hierarchical semantic aggregation. % aggregating multi-level\ndescriptions. Using LongCaption-Agent, we curated a new long-caption dataset,\nLongCaption-10K.

    "abstract": "Electronic Design Automation (EDA) plays a crucial role in classical chip\ndesign and significantly influences the development of quantum chip design.\nHowever, traditional EDA tools cannot be directly applied to quantum chip\ndesign due to vast differences compared to the classical realm. Several EDA\nproducts tailored for quantum chip design currently exist, yet they only cover\npartial stages of the quantum chip design process instead of offering a fully\ncomprehensive solution. Additionally, they often encounter issues such as\nlimited automation, steep learning curves, challenges in integrating with\nactual fabrication processes, and difficulties in expanding functionality. To\naddress these issues, we developed a full-stack EDA tool specifically for\nquantum chip design, called EDA-Q. The design workflow incorporates\nfunctionalities present in existing quantum EDA tools while supplementing\ncritical design stages such as device mapping and fabrication process mapping,\nwhich users expect. EDA-Q utilizes a unique architecture to achieve exceptional\nscalability and flexibility. The integrated design mode guarantees algorithm\ncompatibility with different chip components, while employing a specialized\ninteractive processing mode to offer users a straightforward and adaptable\ncommand interface. Application examples demonstrate that EDA-Q significantly\nreduces chip design cycles, enhances automation levels, and decreases the time\nrequired for manual intervention. Multiple rounds of testing on the designed\nchip have validated the effectiveness of EDA-Q in practical applications.",

In classical KPRP, $N$ agents chose\namong $N$ restaurants at random. If multiple users choose the same restaurant,\nonly one will eat. In a dining club, agents coordinate to avoid choosing the\nsame restaurant, but may collide with users outside the club. We consider a\ndynamic in which agents switch among clubs or the unaffiliated (free agent)\ngroup based on their comparative probability of eating.

The\nenhancement is due to the multiband effects characterized by interband pairing.\nWe also demonstrate the sign reversal of the photocurrent conductivity around\nthe topological transition with increasing the Zeeman field. This finding\nsupports the prediction in our previous work without considering collective\nexcitation modes [H. Tanaka, et al., Phys. Rev. B 110, 014520 (2024)]. The sign\nreversal phenomenon is attributed to the magnetic injection current modified by\nthe Higgs mode, and is proposed for a bulk probe of topological\nsuperconductors. We also discuss the interplay of quantum geometry and\ncollective modes.",

    "abstract": "Existing Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) studies are trained in a fully\nsupervised manner, which requires all frames in a video to be annotated,\nthereby incurring high annotation cost compared to Image Scene Graph Generation\n(ImgSGG). Although the annotation cost of VidSGG can be alleviated by adopting\na weakly supervised approach commonly used for ImgSGG (WS-ImgSGG) that uses\nimage captions, there are two key reasons that hinder such a naive adoption: 1)\nTemporality within video captions, i.e., unlike image captions, video captions\ninclude temporal markers (e.g., before, while, then, after) that indicate time\nrelated details, and 2) Variability in action duration, i.e., unlike human\nactions in image captions, human actions in video captions unfold over varying\nduration. To address these issues, we propose a Natural Language-based Video\nScene Graph Generation (NL-VSGG) framework that only utilizes the readily\navailable video captions for training a VidSGG model. NL-VSGG consists of two\nkey modules: Temporality-aware Caption Segmentation (TCS) module and Action\nDuration Variability-aware caption-frame alignment (ADV) module. Specifically,\nTCS segments the video captions into multiple sentences in a temporal order\nbased on a Large Language Model (LLM), and ADV aligns each segmented sentence\nwith appropriate frames considering the variability in action duration. Our\napproach leads to a significant enhancement in performance compared to simply\napplying the WS-ImgSGG pipeline to VidSGG on the Action Genome dataset. As a\nfurther benefit of utilizing the video captions as weak supervision, we show\nthat the VidSGG model trained by NL-VSGG is able to predict a broader range of\naction classes that are not included in the training data, which makes our\nframework practical in reality.",

A comprehensive evaluation of users' preferences reveals a\nclose relationship with individual walking strategies.

However, when reasoning steps reflect social\nstereotypes (e.g., those related to gender, race or age), they can reinforce\nharmful associations and lead to misleading conclusions. We present the first\nsystematic evaluation of social bias within LLM-generated reasoning, using the\nBBQ dataset to analyze both prediction accuracy and bias. Our study spans a\nwide range of mainstream reasoning models, including instruction-tuned and\nCoT-augmented variants of DeepSeek-R1 (8B/32B), ChatGPT, and other open-source\nLLMs. We quantify how biased reasoning steps correlate with incorrect\npredictions and often lead to stereotype expression. To mitigate\nreasoning-induced bias, we propose Answer Distribution as Bias Proxy (ADBP), a\nlightweight mitigation method that detects bias by tracking how model\npredictions change across incremental reasoning steps. ADBP outperforms a\nstereotype-free baseline in most cases, mitigating bias and improving the\naccuracy of LLM outputs. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.",

In this article we review recent progress in\nthis subject, focussing on understanding quantum effects on black hole entropy.\nSupersymmetry plays a key role in these developments and leads to prototype\nsystems where we can discuss quantum effects to great precision. Our discussion\nhas two strands, both of which involve the gravitational path integral that\ncalculates the supersymmetric index. In the first strand we discuss\nsupersymmetric black holes in the microcanonical ensemble, which are decoupled\nfrom the environment and can be treated as independent quantum systems. Using\nmethods of supersymmetric localization one can arrive at the integer quantum\ndegeneracies of such systems purely in terms of the gravitational variables. In\nthe second strand we consider grand-canonical ensembles in gravity in which\nblack holes arise as a finite-action excitation in asymptotically flat or Anti\nde Sitter space. In this context we discuss the saddle-points of the\ngravitational index, and how they reproduce the black hole action and entropy\nthat agree with the index of the holographic superconformal field theory even\nbeyond the leading order in the semiclassical approximation. Finally we discuss\nhow the gravitational index informs us about the detailed structure of the\nnon-perturbative sum over saddle points and the resulting phases of the theory.\nThroughout, we try to highlight the central role played by the methods as well\nas foundational concepts of supergravity in driving these developments.",

The content of the drawings heavily relies on the\ntask, and the ecological validity of the conclusions is low; 2. The\ninterpretation of drawings relies too much on the subjective feelings of the\nresearchers. To address this issue, this study uses the Large Language Model\n(LLM) to identify 1420 children's scientific drawings (covering 9 scientific\nthemes/concepts), and uses the word2vec algorithm to calculate their semantic\nsimilarity. The study explores whether there are consistent drawing\nrepresentations for children on the same theme, and attempts to establish a\nnorm for children's scientific drawings, providing a baseline reference for\nfollow-up children's drawing research. The results show that the representation\nof most drawings has consistency, manifested as most semantic similarity>0.8.\nAt the same time, it was found that the consistency of the representation is\nindependent of the accuracy (of LLM's recognition), indicating the existence of\nconsistency bias. In the subsequent exploration of influencing factors, we used\nKendall rank correlation coefficient to investigate the effects of \"sample\nsize\", \"abstract degree\", and \"focus points\" on drawings, and used word\nfrequency statistics to explore whether children represented abstract\nthemes/concepts by reproducing what was taught in class.

In this survey, we take\na different perspective and illustrate how results and ideas from descriptive\nset theory provide new insights and techniques to the theory of distributed\ncomputing. We focus on the two classical topics from graph theory, vertex and\nedge colorings. After summarizing the up-to-date results from both areas, we\ndiscuss the adaptation of Marks' games method to the LOCAL model of distributed\ncomputing and the development of the multi-step Vizing's chain technique, which\nled to the construction of the first non-trivial distributed algorithms for\nVizing colorings. We provide a list of related open problems to complement our\ndiscussion. Finally, we describe an efficient deterministic distributed\nalgorithm for Brooks coloring on graphs of subexponential growth.",

CTL can\nexpress properties such as reachability, termination, invariants and\nresponsiveness, which are difficult to test. This paper suggests a mechanism\nfor the automated repair of infinite-state programs guided by CTL properties.\nOur produced patches avoid the overfitting issue that occurs in\ntest-suite-guided repair, where the repaired code may not pass tests outside\nthe given test suite. To realize this vision, we propose a repair framework\nbased on Datalog, a widely used domain-specific language for program analysis,\nwhich readily supports nested fixed-point semantics of CTL via stratified\nnegation. Specifically, our framework encodes the program and CTL properties\ninto Datalog facts and rules and performs the repair by modifying the facts to\npass the analysis rules. Previous research proposed a generic repair mechanism\nfor Datalog-based analysis in the form of Symbolic Execution of Datalog (SEDL).\nHowever, SEDL only supports positive Datalog, which is insufficient for\nexpressing CTL properties. Thus, we extended SEDL to make it applicable to\nstratified Datalog. Moreover, liveness property violations involve infinite\ncomputations, which we handle via a novel loop summarization. Our approach\nachieves analysis accuracy of 56.6% on a small-scale benchmark and 88.5% on a\nreal-world benchmark, outperforming the best baseline performances of 27.7% and\n76.9%.

Given selected\ncontext sentences, an LLM generates QA pairs that are supported by these\nsentences. This leverages LLMs' natural strengths in text generation while\nensuring clear attribution paths in the synthetic training data. We show that\nthe attribution data synthesized via SynQA is highly effective for fine-tuning\nsmall LMs for context attribution in different QA tasks and domains.

We prove a $\\Omega(\\frac{n^{1-1/t}\\ln\n1/\\delta}{\\epsilon^2})$ lower bound for moment estimation for $t>1$, and show\noptimal sample complexity bound $\\Theta(\\frac{n^{1-1/t}\\ln\n1/\\delta}{\\epsilon^2})$ for moment estimation for $t\\geq 2$. Hence, we obtain a\ncomplete understanding of the sample complexity for moment estimation using\nproportional sampling for $t\\geq 2$. We also study the moment estimation\nproblem in the beyond worst-case analysis paradigm and identify a new {\\it\nmoment-density} parameter of the input that characterizes the sample complexity\nof the problem using proportional sampling and derive tight sample complexity\nbounds with respect to that parameter. We also study the moment estimation\nproblem in the hybrid sampling framework in which one is given additional\naccess to a uniform sampling oracle and show that hybrid sampling framework\ndoes not provide any additional gain over the proportional sampling oracle in\nthe worst case.",

    "abstract": "Graph-based Sequential Recommender systems (GSRs) have gained significant\nresearch attention due to their ability to simultaneously handle user-item\ninteractions and sequential relationships between items. Current GSRs often\nutilize composite or in-depth structures for graph encoding (e.g., the Graph\nTransformer). Nevertheless, they have high computational complexity, hindering\nthe deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Moreover, the relative\nposition encoding in Graph Transformer has difficulty in considering the\ncomplicated positional dependencies within sequence. To this end, we propose an\nExternal Attentive Graph convolutional network with Positional prompts for\nSequential recommendation, namely EA-GPS. Specifically, we first introduce an\nexternal attentive graph convolutional network that linearly measures the\nglobal associations among nodes via two external memory units. Then, we present\na positional prompt-based decoder that explicitly treats the absolute item\npositions as external prompts. By introducing length-adaptive sequential\nmasking and a soft attention network, such a decoder facilitates the model to\ncapture the long-term positional dependencies and contextual relationships\nwithin sequences. Extensive experimental results on five real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed EA-GPS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\nRemarkably, it achieves the superior performance while maintaining a smaller\nparameter size and lower training overhead.

Stellar photometry from space missions such as MOST, CoRoT,\nKepler, and, in future PLATO, provide thousands of highly precise light curves\n(LC) that can shed new light upon stellar activity, in particular through the\nsignature of transiting spots. Aims. We study the impact of star spots on light\ncurves in the Fourier domain, reducing the degeneracies encountered by direct\nspot modelling in the temporal domain, and use this new formulation to explore\nthe spot properties from the available data. Methods. We propose a model of LC\npower spectra at low frequency based on a description of spot transits that\nallows us to retrieve information about the amplitude of their photometric\nimpact $\\mathcal{H}$, and about the spot mean lifetime over the observation\n$\\tau_{\\rm life}$ when the power spectrum exibits rotation peaks. We first\nvalidate this method with simulated LCs and then apply it to the Kepler data to\nextract global trends over a set of more than 37 755 stars. Results. This\nanalysis leads to a classification of the sample into \"peakless\" or \"with\npeaks\" spectra, and enables the identification of different activity regimes\nbased on $\\mathcal{H}$ and $\\tau_{\\rm life}$ for different ranges of Rossby\nnumber. More specifically, we observe an intense regime of activity between Ro\n= 0.7 and Ro = 1, for stars with masses under 1$M_\\odot$. Conclusions.

Gossip\nalgorithms distribute information in a scalable and efficient way by having\nrandom pairs of nodes exchange small messages. Value aggregation problems are\nof particular interest in this setting, as they occur frequently in practice,\nand many elegant algorithms have been proposed for computing aggregates and\nstatistics such as averages and quantiles. An important and well-studied\nadvantage of gossip algorithms is their robustness to message delays, network\nchurn, and unreliable message transmissions. However, these crucial robustness\nguarantees only hold if all nodes follow the protocol and no messages are\ncorrupted. In this paper, we remedy this by providing a framework to model both\nadversarial participants and message corruptions in gossip-style communications\nby allowing an adversary to control a small fraction of the nodes or corrupt\nmessages arbitrarily. Despite this very powerful and general corruption model,\nwe show that robust gossip algorithms can be designed for many important\naggregation problems. Our algorithms guarantee that almost all nodes converge\nto an approximately correct answer with optimal efficiency and essentially as\nfast as without corruptions. The design of adversarially-robust gossip\nalgorithms poses completely new challenges. Despite this, our algorithms remain\nvery simple variations of known non-robust algorithms with often only subtle\nchanges to avoid non-compliant nodes gaining too much influence over outcomes.\nWhile our algorithms remain simple, their analysis is much more complex and\noften requires a completely different approach than the non-adversarial\nsetting.",

These\nchallenges are exacerbated by the progressive nature of AD, where subtle\npathophysiological changes often precede clinical symptoms by decades. To\naddress these limitations, this study proposes a novel approach that takes\nadvantage of routinely collected general laboratory test histories for the\nearly detection and differential diagnosis of AD. By modeling lab test\nsequences as \"sentences\", we apply word embedding techniques to capture latent\nrelationships between tests and employ deep time series models, including\nlong-short-term memory (LSTM) and Transformer networks, to model temporal\npatterns in patient records.

At the core of\nthe MoE model is the router, which learns the underlying clustering structure\nof the input distribution in order to send input tokens to appropriate experts.\nHowever, latent clusters may be unidentifiable in high dimension, which causes\nslow convergence, susceptibility to data contamination, and overall degraded\nrepresentations as the router is unable to perform appropriate token-expert\nmatching. We examine the router through the lens of clustering optimization and\nderive optimal feature weights that maximally identify the latent clusters. We\nuse these weights to compute the token-expert routing assignments in an\nadaptively transformed space that promotes well-separated clusters, which helps\nidentify the best-matched expert for each token. In particular, for each expert\ncluster, we compute a set of weights that scales features according to whether\nthat expert clusters tightly along that feature. We term this novel router the\nAdaptive Clustering (AC) router. Our AC router enables the MoE model to obtain\nthree connected benefits: 1) faster convergence, 2) better robustness to data\ncorruption, and 3) overall performance improvement, as experts are specialized\nin semantically distinct regions of the input space. We empirically demonstrate\nthe advantages of our AC router over baseline routing methods when applied on a\nvariety of MoE backbones for language modeling and image recognition tasks in\nboth clean and corrupted settings.",

Three main types of KV cache\ncompression techniques, namely sparsity, channel compression, and quantization,\nhave been identified. This study presents SVDq, a Singular Value Decomposition\n(SVD) - based mixed precision quantization method for K cache. Initially, K\ncache is transformed into latent channels using SVD basis representations.\nSince the values in latent channels decay rapidly and become negligible after\nonly a few latent channels, our method then incorporates importance-aware\nquantization and compression for latent channels. This enables the effective\nallocation of higher precision to more significant channels. Theoretically, we\nprove that SVDq results in quantization errors (x0.1 or even lower) that are\nmuch lower than those of per-channel key quantization in the original space.\nOur findings based on RULER and LongBench benchmarks demonstrate that SVDq can\nachieve an equivalent key cache precision as low as 1.25-bit.

In\naddition, existing deep models learn features in Euclidean space, where PolSAR\ncomplex matrix is commonly converted into a complex-valued vector as the\nnetwork input, distorting matrix structure and channel relationship. However,\nthe complex covariance matrix is Hermitian positive definite (HPD), and resides\non a Riemannian manifold instead of a Euclidean one. Existing methods cannot\nmeasure the geometric distance of HPD matrices and easily cause some\nmisclassifications due to inappropriate Euclidean measures. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel Riemannian Sparse Representation Learning Network\n(SRSR CNN) for PolSAR images. Firstly, a superpixel-based Riemannian Sparse\nRepresentation (SRSR) model is designed to learn the sparse features with\nRiemannian metric. Then, the optimization procedure of the SRSR model is\ninferred and further unfolded into an SRSRnet, which can automatically learn\nthe sparse coefficients and dictionary atoms. Furthermore, to learn contextual\nhigh-level features, a CNN-enhanced module is added to improve classification\nperformance. The proposed network is a Sparse Representation (SR) guided deep\nlearning model, which can directly utilize the covariance matrix as the network\ninput, and utilize Riemannian metric to learn geometric structure and sparse\nfeatures of complex matrices in Riemannian space.

Non-vanishing alignment\nangles introduce frustration in the many-body interactions, and we investigate\nits effect on the collective behavior of the system. Through numerical\nsimulations of an agent-based microscopic model, we found that the system\nexhibits distinct phenomenology compared to the original self-propelled rods.\nIn particular, anti-parallel bands are observed in an intermediate parameter\nrange.

    "abstract": "Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research\nfocus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in\nreal-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are\ndeployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel\ntask, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents\nunique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by\nadding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning,\nwhere expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for\ntimely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible\nspatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to\ntackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based\nspatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D\nsamples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic\nwhile still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph.\nWe introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates\na negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning\nand graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the\nframework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF\nperformance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three\npotential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental\nresults show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly\non expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the\nexpanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete\nobservations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores\nthe generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.",

We investigate whether there is a systematic offset between the\npeculiar velocities ($v_{\\rm z,kSZ}$) estimated with the kSZ effect and the\ntrue velocities of halos. We first created mocks of the 2D maps of SZ effects\nin seven frequency bands for galaxy clusters spanning a broad range of masses\nin TNG 300-3. We then derived the line-of-sight (LOS) peculiar velocities of\ngalaxy clusters by applying an analytical formula to fit the spectra of the SZ\neffect. We find that the analytical formula-fitting method tends to\noverestimate the peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters, regardless of whether\nthey approach us or recede from us. However, when galaxy clusters larger than\n500 km/s were excluded, the slopes of the relations between $v_{\\rm z,kSZ}$ and\nthe real LOS velocities of galaxy clusters ($v_{\\rm z,halo}$) were consistent\nwith unity within the errors. Additionally, we further accounted for\nobservational noise for different-aperture telescopes under different\nprecipitable water vapor. The slopes for most cases are consistent with unity\nwithin the errors, and the errors of the slopes slightly increase with higher\nobservation noise. The $|v_{\\rm z,kSZ}-v_{\\rm z,halo}|$ exhibits no obvious\ntrend with increasing concentration and $M_{\\rm 200}$. It is noteworthy that\nthe $|v_{\\rm z,kSZ}-v_{\\rm z,halo}|$ is relatively high for galaxy clusters\nwith strong active galactic nucleus feedback and high star formation rates.\nThis indicates that these physical processes affect the cluster dynamic state\nand may reflect on the peculiar velocity estimated from the kSZ effect.",

Using MIMIC-CXR and Open-I datasets, our model,\nCSTRL - Context-driven Sequential TRansfer Learning - achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance, showing 56.2% improvement in BLEU-1, 40.5% in BLEU-2, 84.3% in\nBLEU-3, 28.9% in ROUGE-1, 41.0% in ROUGE-2 and 26.5% in ROGUE-3 score over\nbenchmark studies. We also analyze factual consistency scores while preserving\nthe medical context. Our code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/fahmidahossain/Report_Summarization.",

In this work, we introduce ORCA, a novel\nresource-efficient cloud-assisted environmental sound recognition system on\nbatteryless devices operating over the Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs),\ntargeting wide-area audio sensing applications.

We implement ORCA on an energy-harvesting batteryless\nmicrocontroller and evaluate it in a real world urban sound testbed.

However, little progress has been made for\noptimal combinatorial auctions (CAs), even for the single bidder case, because\nwe need to overcome the challenge of the bundle space growing exponentially\nwith the number of items. For example, when learning a menu of allocation-price\nchoices for a bidder in a CA, each menu element needs to efficiently and\nflexibly specify a probability distribution on bundles. In this paper, we solve\nthis problem in the single-bidder CA setting by generating a bundle\ndistribution through an ordinary differential equation (ODE) applied to a\ntractable initial distribution, drawing inspiration from generative models,\nespecially score-based diffusion models and continuous normalizing flow. Our\nmethod, BundleFlow, uses deep learning to find suitable ODE-based transforms of\ninitial distributions, one transform for each menu element, so that the overall\nmenu achieves high expected revenue. Our method achieves 1.11$-$2.23$\\times$\nhigher revenue compared with automated mechanism design baselines on the\nsingle-bidder version of CATS, a standard CA testbed, and scales to problems\nwith up to 150 items.

To address this\nproblem, we explore the inner workings of a Transformer model by finding an\nexisting subnetwork that contributes to the generalization performance and by\nperforming causal analyses on how the model utilizes syntactic features.

The\nstatic approach selects predictors via marginal correlation screening and\nscales them using univariate predictive slopes, while the dynamic method\nscreens and scales predictors based on time series regression incorporating\nlagged predictors.

In the\nsimulation study, we validate the effectiveness of SSRF and identify its\nparameter adjustment strategies in high-dimensional data settings.

In earlier ages, Android allowed easy\naccess to non-resettable device identifiers like device serial numbers and IMEI\nby third-party apps for user tracking. As privacy concerns grew, Google has\ntightened restrictions on these identifiers in native Android. Despite this,\nstakeholders in custom Android systems seek consistent and stable user tracking\ncapabilities across different system and device models, and they have\nintroduced covert channels (e.g., system properties and settings) in customized\nsystems to access identifiers, which undoubtedly increases the risk of user\nprivacy breaches. This paper examines the introduction of non-resettable\nidentifiers through system customization and their vulnerability due to poor\naccess control. We present IDRadar, a scalable and accurate approach for\nidentifying vulnerable properties and settings on custom Android ROMs. Applying\nour approach to 1,814 custom ROMs, we have identified 8,192 system properties\nand 3,620 settings that store non-resettable identifiers, with 3,477 properties\nand 1,336 settings lacking adequate access control, which can be abused by\nthird-party apps to track users without permissions. Our large-scale analysis\ncan identify a large number of security issues which are two orders of\nmagnitude greater than existing techniques. We further investigate the root\ncauses of these access control deficiencies. Validation on 32 devices through\nthe remote testing service confirmed our results. Additionally, we observe that\nthe vulnerable properties and settings occur in devices of the same OEMs. We\nhave reported our findings to the vendors and received positive confirmations.\nOur work underscores the need for greater scrutiny of covert access channels to\ndevice identifiers and better solutions to safeguard user privacy.",

Using the existing\nmechanisms such as Overhauser DNP (ODNP) is still difficult to achieve\nsignificant enhancement of NMR signals in solutions at a high magnetic field.\nThe recently proposed J-driven DNP (JDNP) condition (when the exchange\ninteraction of two electron spins matches their Lamour frequency) may enable\nsignal enhancement in solution as it requires only dipolar interaction between\nthe biradical polarization agent and the analyte. However, likewise ODNP, the\ncurrent JDNP strategy still requires the saturation of the electron\npolarization with high microwave power which has poor penetration and is\nassociated with heating effects in most liquids. The replacement of high-power\nmicrowave irradiation is possible if the temporal electron polarization\nimbalance is created by a different wavelength such as the visible light. Here,\nwe propose a triplet JDNP mechanism which first exploits the light-induced\nsinglet fission process (i.e., a singlet exciton is converted into two triplet\nexcitons). As the JDNP condition is fulfilled, a triplet-to-triplet\ncross-relaxation process will occur with different rates and consequently lead\nto the creation of hyperpolarization on the coupled nuclear spin states. This\ncommunication discusses the theory behind the triplet JDNP proposal, as well as\nthe polarizing agents and conditions that will enable the new approach to\nenhance the sensitivity of NMR without the need of microwave irradiation.",

These\nerrors are often excluded from CSC datasets during the annotation process or\nignored during evaluation, even when they have been annotated. This issue\nlimits the practicality of the CSC task. To address this issue, we introduce\nthe task of General Chinese Character Error Correction (C2EC), which focuses on\nall three types of character errors. We construct a high-quality C2EC benchmark\nby combining and manually verifying data from CCTC and Lemon datasets. We\nextend the training-free prompt-free CSC method to C2EC by using Levenshtein\ndistance for handling length changes and leveraging an additional prompt-based\nlarge language model (LLM) to improve performance. Experiments show that our\nmethod enables a 14B-parameter LLM to be on par with models nearly 50 times\nlarger on both conventional CSC and C2EC tasks, without any fine-tuning.",

This\npaper investigates the use of sequential deep learning models, including\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and\nTransformers, for real-time flock detection in multi-pedestrian trajectories.\nOur proposed approach consists of a two-stage process: first, a pre-trained\nbinary classification model is used for pairwise trajectory classification, and\nsecond, the learned representations are applied to identify multi-agent flocks\ndynamically.\n  We validate our method using real-world group movement datasets,\ndemonstrating its robustness across varying sequence lengths and diverse\nmovement patterns. Experimental results indicate that our model consistently\ndetects pedestrian flocks with high accuracy and stability, even in dynamic and\nnoisy environments.

Pre-training with large-scale images achieves promising results in\nvarious tasks, but prior methods for 3D hand pose pre-training have not fully\nutilized the potential of diverse hand images accessible from in-the-wild\nvideos. To facilitate scalable pre-training, we first prepare an extensive pool\nof hand images from in-the-wild videos and design our pre-training method with\ncontrastive learning. Specifically, we collect over 2.0M hand images from\nrecent human-centric videos, such as 100DOH and Ego4D. To extract\ndiscriminative information from these images, we focus on the similarity of\nhands: pairs of non-identical samples with similar hand poses. We then propose\na novel contrastive learning method that embeds similar hand pairs closer in\nthe feature space. Our method not only learns from similar samples but also\nadaptively weights the contrastive learning loss based on inter-sample\ndistance, leading to additional performance gains. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms conventional contrastive learning approaches that\nproduce positive pairs sorely from a single image with data augmentation.

Although the developers sought to redress image\ngeneration's sociopolitical dimension by introducing diversity \"corrections,\"\ntheir opaque imposition of a standard for \"diversity\" ultimately proved\ncounterproductive. In this paper, we present an alternative approach: an image\ngeneration interface designed to embrace open negotiation along the\nsociopolitical dimensions of image creation. Grounded in the principles of\nagonistic pluralism (from the Greek agon, meaning struggle), our interface\nactively engages users with competing visual interpretations of their prompts.\nThrough a lab study with 29 participants, we evaluate our agonistic interface\non its ability to facilitate reflection - engagement with other perspectives\nand challenging dominant assumptions - a core principle that underpins\nagonistic contestation. We compare it to three existing paradigms: a standard\ninterface, a Gemini-style interface that produces \"diverse\" images, and an\nintention-centric interface suggesting prompt refinements. Our findings\ndemonstrate that the agonistic interface enhances reflection across multiple\nmeasures, but also that reflection depends on users perceiving the interface as\nboth appropriate and empowering; introducing diversity without grounding it in\nrelevant political contexts was perceived as inauthentic.

A central feature of this framework is\nthe appearance of noises and transport coefficients, referred to as bare\ntransport coefficients. These coefficients, generally different from the\nmacroscopic transport coefficients of the deterministic Navier-Stokes equation,\nare challenging to measure directly because macroscopic measurements typically\nyield the latter coefficients. This paper addresses the questions of how bare\ntransport coefficients manifest in measurable physical quantities and how\npractical methodologies can be developed for their determination. As a\nprototype example, we examine the shear viscosity of two-dimensional dense\nfluids. The numerical simulations of the fluctuating hydrodynamic equations\nreveal that near solid walls, where hydrodynamic fluctuations are significantly\nsuppressed, the bare shear viscosity governs the fluid dynamics. The\ntheoretical calculations, based on perturbation expansion of the fluctuating\nhydrodynamic equations, confirm this suppression of hydrodynamic fluctuations\nat walls and yield analytical expressions for the observed shear viscosity.\nBased on this finding, we develop a methodology to accurately determine the\nbare shear viscosity using a controlled shear flow. Furthermore, we provide\ndetailed numerical investigations of the role of an ultraviolet cutoff length\nin fluctuating hydrodynamics. These establish that the lower bound of the\nultraviolet cutoff length is on the order of atomic diameter and highlight that\nbare viscosity is determined solely by microscopic details below this scale.",

Our goal is to maximize the sum of expected cumulative\nrewards, a.k.a. social welfare, while ensuring that each agent receives an\nexpected reward that is at least a constant fraction of the maximum possible\nexpected reward.\n  Our proposed algorithm, RewardFairUCB, leverages the Upper Confidence Bound\n(UCB) technique to achieve sublinear regret bounds for both fairness and social\nwelfare.

    "abstract": "Mitigating cybersickness can improve the usability of virtual reality (VR)\nand increase its adoption. The most widely used technique, dynamic\nfield-of-view (FOV) restriction, mitigates cybersickness by blacking out the\nperipheral region of the user's FOV. However, this approach reduces the\nvisibility of the virtual environment. We propose peripheral teleportation, a\nnovel technique that creates a rest frame (RF) in the user's peripheral vision\nusing content rendered from the current virtual environment. Specifically, the\nperipheral region is rendered by a pair of RF cameras whose transforms are\nupdated by the user's physical motion. We apply alternating teleportations\nduring translations, or snap turns during rotations, to the RF cameras to keep\nthem close to the current viewpoint transformation. Consequently, the optical\nflow generated by RF cameras matches the user's physical motion, creating a\nstable peripheral view. In a between-subjects study (N = 90), we compared\nperipheral teleportation with a traditional black FOV restrictor and an\nunrestricted control condition. The results showed that peripheral\nteleportation significantly reduced discomfort and enabled participants to stay\nimmersed in the virtual environment for a longer duration of time. Overall,\nthese findings suggest that peripheral teleportation is a promising technique\nthat VR practitioners may consider adding to their cybersickness mitigation\ntoolset.",

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of prescribed curvatures on a quasi-2D assembly of\nanisotropic patchy particles. By varying curvature and surface coverage, we\nuncover a rich geometric phase diagram, with curvature inducing ordered\nstructures entirely absent on planar surfaces. Large spatial domains of ordered\nstructures can contain hidden microdomains of orientational textures imprinted\nby the surface on the assembly. The dynamical landscape is also reshaped by\nsurface curvature, with a glass state emerging at modest densities and high\ncurvature.

This trend raises new challenges in optimizing sustainability\nwithout sacrificing scalability or performance. Among the energy-efficient\nalternatives of the traditional Von Neumann architecture, neuromorphic\ncomputing and its Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising choice due to\ntheir inherent energy efficiency. However, in some real-world application\nscenarios such as complex continuous control tasks, SNNs often lack the\nperformance optimizations that traditional artificial neural networks have.\nResearchers have addressed this by combining SNNs with Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DeepRL), yet scalability remains unexplored. In this paper, we extend\nour previous work on SpikeRL, which is a scalable and energy efficient\nframework for DeepRL-based SNNs for continuous control. In our initial\nimplementation of SpikeRL framework, we depended on the population encoding\nfrom the Population-coded Spiking Actor Network (PopSAN) method for our SNN\nmodel and implemented distributed training with Message Passing Interface (MPI)\nthrough mpi4py. Also, further optimizing our model training by using\nmixed-precision for parameter updates. In our new SpikeRL framework, we have\nimplemented our own DeepRL-SNN component with population encoding, and\ndistributed training with PyTorch Distributed package with NCCL backend while\nstill optimizing with mixed precision training. Our new SpikeRL implementation\nis 4.26X faster and 2.25X more energy efficient than state-of-the-art\nDeepRL-SNN methods.

Current assessments of autonomy often focus on\nspecific risks and rely on run-time evaluations -- observations of agent\nactions during operation. We introduce a code-based assessment of autonomy that\neliminates the need to run an AI agent to perform specific tasks, thereby\nreducing the costs and risks associated with run-time evaluations. Using this\ncode-based framework, the orchestration code used to run an AI agent can be\nscored according to a taxonomy that assesses attributes of autonomy: impact and\noversight.

    "abstract": "Abridged. Stochastic fluctuations in the spin frequency $\\nu$ of a\nrotation-powered pulsar affect how accurately one measures the power-law\nbraking index, $n_{\\rm pl}$, defined through $\\dot{\\nu}=K\\nu^{n_{\\rm pl}}$, and\ncan lead to measurements of anomalous braking indices, with $\\vert n \\vert =\n\\vert \\nu \\ddot{\\nu}/ \\dot{\\nu}^{2} \\vert \\gg1$, where the overdot symbolizes a\nderivative with respect to time. Previous studies show that the variance of the\nmeasured $n$ obeys the predictive, falsifiable formula $\\langle n^{2} \\rangle =\nn_{\\rm\npl}^{2}+\\sigma^{2}_{\\ddot{\\nu}}\\nu^{2}\\gamma_{\\ddot{\\nu}}^{-2}\\dot{\\nu}^{-4}T_{\\rm\nobs}^{-1}$ for $\\dot{K}=0$, where $\\sigma_{\\ddot{\\nu}}$ is the timing noise\namplitude, $\\gamma_{\\ddot{\\nu}}^{-1}$ is a stellar damping time-scale, and\n$T_{\\rm obs}$ is the total observing time. Here we combine this formula with a\nhierarchical Bayesian scheme to infer the population-level distribution of\n$n_{\\rm pl}$ for a pulsar population of size $M$. The scheme is validated using\nsynthetic data. For a plausible test population with $M=100$ and injected\n$n_{\\rm pl}$ values drawn from a population-level Gaussian with mean $\\mu_{\\rm\npl}=4$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\rm pl}=0.5$, intermediate between\nelectromagnetic braking and mass quadrupole gravitational radiation reaction,\nthe Bayesian scheme infers $\\mu_{\\rm pl}=3.89^{+0.24}_{-0.23}$ and $\\sigma_{\\rm\npl}=0.43^{+0.21}_{-0.14}$. The $M=100$ per-pulsar posteriors for $n_{\\rm pl}$\nand $\\sigma^{2}_{\\ddot{\\nu}}\\gamma_{\\ddot{\\nu}}^{-2}$ contain $87\\%$ and\n$69\\%$, respectively, of the injected values within their $90\\%$ credible\nintervals.

Specifically,\nLung-DDPM achieved superior performance on our large validation cohort, with a\nFr\\'echet inception distance (FID) of 0.0047, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) of\n0.0070, and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0024.

    "abstract": "Object extraction and segmentation from remote sensing (RS) images is a\ncritical yet challenging task in urban environment monitoring. Urban morphology\nis inherently complex, with irregular objects of diverse shapes and varying\nscales. These challenges are amplified by heterogeneity and scale disparities\nacross RS data sources, including sensors, platforms, and modalities, making\naccurate object segmentation particularly demanding. While the Segment Anything\nModel (SAM) has shown significant potential in segmenting complex scenes, its\nperformance in handling form-varying objects remains limited due to\nmanual-interactive prompting. To this end, we propose UrbanSAM, a customized\nversion of SAM specifically designed to analyze complex urban environments\nwhile tackling scaling effects from remotely sensed observations. Inspired by\nmulti-resolution analysis (MRA) theory, UrbanSAM incorporates a novel learnable\nprompter equipped with a Uscaling-Adapter that adheres to the invariance\ncriterion, enabling the model to capture multiscale contextual information of\nobjects and adapt to arbitrary scale variations with theoretical guarantees.\nFurthermore, features from the Uscaling-Adapter and the trunk encoder are\naligned through a masked cross-attention operation, allowing the trunk encoder\nto inherit the adapter's multiscale aggregation capability. This synergy\nenhances the segmentation performance, resulting in more powerful and accurate\noutputs, supported by the learned adapter. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate the flexibility and superior segmentation performance of the\nproposed UrbanSAM on a global-scale dataset, encompassing scale-varying urban\nobjects such as buildings, roads, and water.",

Since annotations in medical images require the expertise of\ndoctors and are more time-consuming and expensive. Thus, some researchers turn\nto unsupervised learning methods, which usually face inevitable performance\ndrops. In addition, medical images may have been acquired at different medical\ncenters with different scanners and under different image acquisition\nprotocols, so the modalities of the medical images are often inconsistent. This\nmodality difference (domain shift) also reduces the applicability of deep\nlearning methods.

However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific\nfeatures such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location.\nThis paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing\nAR-aware prefetching techniques.

    "abstract": "A comprehensive and explicit understanding of surgical scenes plays a vital\nrole in developing context-aware computer-assisted systems in the operating\ntheatre. However, few works provide systematical analysis to enable\nhierarchical surgical scene understanding. In this work, we propose to\nrepresent the tasks set [phase recognition --> step recognition --> action and\ninstrument detection] as multi-level semantic scene understanding (MSSU). For\nthis target, we propose a novel hierarchical context transformer (HCT) network\nand thoroughly explore the relations across the different level tasks.\nSpecifically, a hierarchical relation aggregation module (HRAM) is designed to\nconcurrently relate entries inside multi-level interaction information and then\naugment task-specific features. To further boost the representation learning of\nthe different tasks, inter-task contrastive learning (ICL) is presented to\nguide the model to learn task-wise features via absorbing complementary\ninformation from other tasks. Furthermore, considering the computational costs\nof the transformer, we propose HCT+ to integrate the spatial and temporal\nadapter to access competitive performance on substantially fewer tunable\nparameters. Extensive experiments on our cataract dataset and a publicly\navailable endoscopic PSI-AVA dataset demonstrate the outstanding performance of\nour method, consistently exceeding the state-of-the-art methods by a large\nmargin.

These semigroups\nare generated by non-local, non-self-adjoint operators. In the special case\nwhere the driving L\\'evy process is Brownian motion, one recovers the classical\ndiffusion OU semigroup, whose spectral properties have been extensively studied\nover past few decades. Our main results establish that, under suitable\nconditions on the L\\'evy process, the spectrum of the L\\'evy-OU semigroup in\nthe $L^p$-space weighted with the invariant distribution coincides with that of\nthe diffusion OU semigroup. Furthermore, when the drift matrix $B$ is\ndiagonalizable with real eigenvalues, we derive explicit formulas for\neigenfunctions and co-eigenfunctions--an observation that, to the best of our\nknowledge, has not appeared in the literature. We also show that the\nmultiplicities of the eigenvalues remain independent of the choice of the\nL\\'evy process. A key ingredient in our approach is intertwining relationship:\nwe prove that every L\\'evy-OU semigroup is intertwined with a diffusion OU\nsemigroup.

Recent\nmethods utilize auxiliary unknown classes data to improve classification\nperformance. However, the auxiliary unknown classes data is strongly assumed to\nbe completely separable from known classes and requires labor-intensive\nannotation. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework,\nHOpenCls, to leverage the unlabeled wild data-that is the mixture of known and\nunknown classes. Such wild data is abundant and can be collected freely during\ndeploying classifiers in their living environments. The key insight is\nreformulating the open-set HSI classification with unlabeled wild data as a\npositive-unlabeled (PU) learning problem. Specifically, the multi-label\nstrategy is introduced to bridge the PU learning and open-set HSI\nclassification, and then the proposed gradient contraction and gradient\nexpansion module to make this PU learning problem tractable from the\nobservation of abnormal gradient weights associated with wild data. Extensive\nexperiment results demonstrate that incorporating wild data has the potential\nto significantly enhance open-set HSI classification in complex real-world\nscenarios.",

Moreover, through our preliminary study,\nwe find that just a few automatically generated graphs (less than 10) could be\nenough to cover the code of many graph algorithm implementations, rendering the\ncode coverage-guided fuzzing approach -- one of the state-of-the-art search\nalgorithms -- less efficient than expected.\n  To tackle these challenges, we introduce GraphFuzz, the first automated\nfeedback-guided fuzzing framework for graph algorithm implementations.

    "abstract": "In recent years, widespread internet adoption and the growth in userbase of\nvarious social media platforms have led to an increase in the proliferation of\nextreme speech online. While traditional language models have demonstrated\nproficiency in distinguishing between neutral text and non-neutral text (i.e.\nextreme speech), categorizing the diverse types of extreme speech presents\nsignificant challenges. The task of extreme speech classification is\nparticularly nuanced, as it requires a deep understanding of socio-cultural\ncontexts to accurately interpret the intent of the language used by the\nspeaker. Even human annotators often disagree on the appropriate classification\nof such content, emphasizing the complex and subjective nature of this task.\nThe use of human moderators also presents a scaling issue, necessitating the\nneed for automated systems for extreme speech classification. The recent launch\nof ChatGPT has drawn global attention to the potential applications of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) across a diverse variety of tasks. Trained on vast and\ndiverse corpora, and demonstrating the ability to effectively capture and\nencode contextual information, LLMs emerge as highly promising tools for\ntackling this specific task of extreme speech classification. In this paper, we\nleverage the Indian subset of the extreme speech dataset from Maronikolakis et\nal. (2022) to develop an effective classification framework using LLMs. We\nevaluate open-source Llama models against closed-source OpenAI models, finding\nthat while pre-trained LLMs show moderate efficacy, fine-tuning with\ndomain-specific data significantly enhances performance, highlighting their\nadaptability to linguistic and contextual nuances. Although GPT-based models\noutperform Llama models in zero-shot settings, the performance gap disappears\nafter fine-tuning.",

Existing methods often suffer from coupling, where over-reliance on\ninitial labeled data leads to suboptimal learning; confirmation bias, where\nincorrect predictions reinforce themselves repeatedly; and boundary blur caused\nby limited boundary-awareness and ambiguous edge cues. To address these issues,\nwe propose CW-BASS, a novel framework for SSSS. In order to mitigate the impact\nof incorrect predictions, we assign confidence weights to pseudo-labels.\nAdditionally, we leverage boundary-delineation techniques, which, despite being\nextensively explored in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), remain\nunderutilized in SSSS. Specifically, our method: (1) reduces coupling via a\nconfidence-weighted loss that adjusts pseudo-label influence based on their\npredicted confidence scores, (2) mitigates confirmation bias with a dynamic\nthresholding mechanism that learns to filter out pseudo-labels based on model\nperformance, (3) tackles boundary blur using a boundary-aware module to refine\nsegmentation near object edges, and (4) reduces label noise through a\nconfidence decay strategy that progressively refines pseudo-labels during\ntraining. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes demonstrate\nthat CW-BASS achieves state-of-the-art performance.

There are typically multiple objectives\ndriving the preference, hence humans find it easier to express per-objective\ncomparisons rather than a global preference between two choices.\nMulti-Objective RLHF (MORLHF) aims to use per-objective preference feedback and\nachieve Pareto optimality among these objectives by aggregating them into a\nsingle unified objective for optimization. However, nearly all prior works rely\non linear aggregation, which rules out policies that favor specific objectives\nsuch as the worst one. The only existing approach using non-linear aggregation\nis computationally expensive due to its reward-based nature and the need for\nretraining whenever the aggregation parameters change. In this work, we address\nthis limitation by transforming the non-linear aggregation maximization problem\ninto a series of sub-problems.

However, existing methods often struggle to enforce key\nphysical constraints, such as trace conservation, when modeling reduced density\nmatrices (RDMs). While Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) aim to address\nthese challenges, they frequently fail to achieve full physical consistency. In\nthis work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the $\\mathfrak{su}(n)$\nLie algebra to represent RDMs as a combination of an identity matrix and $n^2 -\n1$ Hermitian, traceless, and orthogonal basis operators,where $n$ is the\nsystem's dimension. By learning only the coefficients associated with this\nbasis, our framework inherently ensures exact trace conservation, as the\ntraceless nature of the basis restricts the trace contribution solely to the\nidentity matrix. This eliminates the need for explicit trace-preserving penalty\nterms in the loss function, simplifying optimization and improving learning\nefficiency. We validate our approach on two benchmark quantum systems: the\nspin-boson model and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. By comparing the\nperformance of four neural network (NN) architectures -- Purely Data-driven\nPhysics-Uninformed Neural Networks (PUNN), $\\mathfrak{su}(n)$ Lie algebra-based\nPUNN ($\\mathfrak{su}(n)$-PUNN), traditional PINN, and $\\mathfrak{su}(n)$ Lie\nalgebra-based PINN ($\\mathfrak{su}(n)$-PINN) -- we highlight the limitations of\nconventional methods and demonstrate the superior accuracy, robustness, and\nefficiency of our approach in learning quantum dissipative dynamics.",

Our work\ninvestigates the relationship between LLM generation likelihood and student\nresponse distributions in MCQs with a specific focus on distractor selections.\nWe collect a comprehensive dataset of MCQs with real-world student response\ndistributions to explore two fundamental research questions: (1). RQ1 - Do the\ndistractors that students more frequently select correspond to those that LLMs\nassign higher generation likelihood to? (2). RQ2 - When an LLM selects a\nincorrect choice, does it choose the same distractor that most students pick?\nOur experiments reveals moderate correlations between LLM-assigned\nprobabilities and student selection patterns for distractors in MCQs.\nAdditionally, when LLMs make mistakes, they are more likley to select the same\nincorrect answers that commonly mislead students, which is a pattern consistent\nacross both small and large language models. Our work provides empirical\nevidence that despite LLMs' strong performance on generating educational\ncontent, there remains a gap between LLM's underlying reasoning process and\nhuman cognitive processes in identifying confusing distractors. Our findings\nalso have significant implications for educational assessment development. The\nsmaller language models could be efficiently utilized for automated distractor\ngeneration as they demonstrate similar patterns in identifying confusing answer\nchoices as larger language models.

As such, the poles on\nunphysical Riemann sheets could be easily extracted. This parametrization\nmethod offers a comparable fit quality to the improved Breit-Wigner\nparametrization with an energy-dependent width function when the coupling\nstrength is moderate. It is found that the parametrization could be used to\ncorrectly extract the poles near the physical region correctly.

This\nstudy addresses this challenge by employing an innovative and computationally\nefficient hybrid methodology that integrates machine learning (ML) methods for\ntime series forecasting with established statistical techniques. The\nspatiotemporal data undergo decomposition using time-dependent Empirical\nOrthogonal Functions (EOFs), denoted as \\(\\phi_{k}(t)\\), and their\ncorresponding spatial coefficients, \\(\\alpha_{k}(s)\\), to reduce\ndimensionality.

However, it remains unclear if\nvisually impaired users, who rely solely on the screen readers (e.g., Talkback)\nto navigate and access app information, can do so in the correct and reasonable\norder. This may result in significant information bias and operational errors.\nConsidering these issues, in this work, we proposed a method named RGNF\n(Re-draw GUI Navigation Flow). It aimed to enhance the understandability and\ncoherence of accessing the content of each component within the Graphical User\nInterface (GUI), together with assisting developers in creating well-designed\nGUI navigation flow (GNF). This method was inspired by the characteristics\nidentified in our preliminary study, where visually impaired users expected\nnavigation to be associated with close position and similar shape of GUI\ncomponents that were read consecutively. Thus, our method relied on the\nprinciples derived from the Gestalt psychological model, aiming to group GUI\ncomponents into different regions according to the laws of proximity and\nsimilarity, thereby redrawing the GNFs. To evaluate the effectiveness of our\nmethod, we calculated sequence similarity values before and after redrawing the\nGNF, and further employed the tools proposed by Alotaibi et al. to measure the\nreachability of GUI components. Our results demonstrated a substantial\nimprovement in similarity (0.921) compared to the baseline (0.624), together\nwith the reachability (90.31%) compared to the baseline GNF (74.35%).\nFurthermore, a qualitative user study revealed that our method had a positive\neffect on providing visually impaired users with an improved user experience.",

Many studies have tackled the challenge of anatomically\nincorrect segmentation predictions by introducing auxiliary modules. These\nmodules either post-process segmentation outputs or enforce consistency between\nspecific points to ensure anatomical correctness. However, such approaches\noften increase network complexity, require separate training for these modules,\nand may lack robustness in scenarios with poor visibility. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture that leverages\ndense associative networks to learn and retain specific patterns inherent to\ncardiac inputs. Unlike traditional methods, our approach restricts the network\nto memorize a limited set of patterns. During forward propagation, a weighted\nsum of these patterns is used to enforce anatomical correctness in the output.\nSince these patterns are input-independent, the model demonstrates enhanced\nrobustness, even in cases with poor visibility. The proposed pipeline was\nevaluated on two publicly available datasets, CAMUS and CardiacNet.\nExperimental results indicate that our model consistently outperforms baseline\napproaches across all metrics, highlighting its effectiveness and reliability\nfor cardiac segmentation tasks.",

    "abstract": "Cloud absorption is acknowledged as the biggest source of uncertainty in the\nclimate models. For over 70 years, many experiments have reported clouds\nabsorbing more solar radiation than theory could predict. In the visible\nspectrum, simulations based on optical constants of water lead to negligible\ncloud absorption. This result had been explored by some experimentalists to\ncalibrate the cloud absorption measurements. However, the author and his\ncollaborators recently discovered that visible light can directly cleave off\nwater molecular clusters at liquid-air interfaces (PNAS, e2312751120, 2023;\ne2320844121, 2024), which is named the photomolecular effect in analogy to the\nphotoelectric effect. This discovery suggests that a crucial piece of physics\nhas been missing in the existing theories: light can be absorbed at water-air\ninterface. The photomolecular effect can be simulated by generalizing the\nboundary conditions for the Maxwell equations using Feibelman parameters that\nwere derived in the past research on the surface photoelectric effect and\nsurface plasmons. In this work, the author uses simulation to show that\nincluding the photomolecular effect at the air-water interface can potentially\nexplain the cloud absorption anomaly. Although the lack of accurate Feibelman\nparameter values prevents a direct comparison of the current theory with\nexperiments, this work points to an unexplored mechanism for explaining the\ncloud absorption anomaly and calls for further investigation on the impacts of\nphotomolecular effect in the climate modeling.",

The framework then synthesizes customized training scenarios\ntargeting these identified limitations, enabling effective and personalized\ncurriculum learning.

We derived extinction ($A_{Ks} = 0.07$-$0.50$), color excess ($E(J-Ks)\n= 0.16$-$0.60$), distances ($D = 2.06$-$8.64$ kpc), and Galactocentric\ndistances ($R_G = 7.69$-$14.81$ kpc). Ages range from 20 Myr to 5 Gyr,\nmetallicity from [Fe/H] = -0.5 to 0.5. Structural parameters include core radii\n($r_c = 0.71'$-$5.21'$) and tidal radii ($r_t = 3.4'$-$12.0'$). Conclusions. We\nconfirm the open cluster nature of nine targets, updating their physical\nparameters.",

The method consists of retaining only the largest\nsingular values of the generator of the transformation between the vison-pair\nand flux-free ground states.

    "abstract": "Categorical response data are ubiquitous in complex survey applications, yet\nfew methods model the dependence across different outcome categories when the\nresponse is ordinal. Likewise, few methods exist for the common combination of\na longitudinal design and categorical data. By modeling individual survey\nresponses at the unit-level, it is possible to capture both ordering\ninformation in ordinal responses and any longitudinal correlation. However,\naccounting for a complex survey design becomes more challenging in the\nunit-level setting. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical, unit-level, model-based\napproach for categorical data that is able to capture ordering among response\ncategories, can incorporate longitudinal dependence, and accounts for the\nsurvey design. To handle computational scalability, we develop efficient Gibbs\nsamplers with appropriate data augmentation as well as variational Bayes\nalgorithms. Using public-use microdata from the Household Pulse Survey, we\nprovide an analysis of an ordinal response that asks about the frequency of\nanxiety symptoms at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. We compare both\ndesign-based and model-based estimators and demonstrate superior performance\nfor the proposed approaches.",

    "abstract": "Semiconvection occurs in regions of stars and planets that are unstable to\noverturning convection according to the Schwarzschild criterion, yet stable\naccording to the Ledoux criterion. Previous simulations in Cartesian boxes have\nadvanced our understanding of the semiconvective instability, layer formation,\nand transport properties. However, much less is known about semiconvection in\nspherical geometry and under the influence of rotation or magnetic fields. We\npresent 3D simulations of semiconvection in the full sphere (including $r=0$),\nand accounting for rotation. We find that the formation and evolution of\nsemiconvective layers in nonrotating spheres occurs in a similar way to\nnonrotating Cartesian boxes, in the sense that the critical density ratio at\nwhich layers are expected to form is approximately the same in both geometries.\nLayers rapidly merge once they form, ultimately leading to a fully mixed\nconvective sphere. The transport properties measured through the Nusselt\nnumbers and the buoyancy flux ratio are also similar to results from previous\nstudies in boxes. When rotation is added to the system, layer formation and\nevolution proceeds in a similar fashion to the nonrotating runs. However,\nrotation hampers the radial transport of heat and composition, and, as a\nresult, the time required for the sphere to become fully mixed gets longer as\nthe flow becomes more rotationally constrained. We also find that\nsemiconvective layers exhibit spherical mixing in nonrotating cases, whereas in\nrotating cases, the mixing becomes more cylindrical. We discuss what is needed\nfor future work to build more realistic models.",
