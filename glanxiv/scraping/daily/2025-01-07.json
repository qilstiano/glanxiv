    "abstract": "In the last decade, various works have used statistics on relations to\nimprove both the theory and practice of conjunctive query execution. Starting\nwith the AGM bound which took advantage of relation sizes, later works\nincorporated statistics like functional dependencies and degree constraints.\nEach new statistic prompted work along two lines; bounding the size of\nconjunctive query outputs and worst-case optimal join algorithms. In this work,\nwe continue in this vein by introducing a new statistic called a\n\\emph{partition constraint}. This statistic captures latent structure within\nrelations by partitioning them into sub-relations which each have much tighter\ndegree constraints. We show that this approach can both refine existing\ncardinality bounds and improve existing worst-case optimal join algorithms.",

IRs are subject to transformations,\nwhich we call ex ante (XA) transformations, that improve the efficiency and\naccuracy of the analysis, thereby directly impacting the validity of analysis\nresults. This paper explores the impact of XA transformations in the setting of\ntiming-based side-channel analysis frameworks, focusing on the constant-time\npolicy that many cryptographic libraries adopt.\n  We identify two properties of XA transformations that directly impact the\nsoundness and precision of side-channel analysis. The first property,\npreservation, requires that the transformation does not introduce leakage and\nis required to avoid false positives, i.e., for precision. The second one,\nreflection, requires that the transformation does not remove leakage and is\nrequired to avoid false negatives, i.e., for soundness. The combination of\npreservation and reflection, which we call transparency, is essential for sound\nand precise transformations. While preservation has been studied in the context\nof secure compilation, there is little work on reflection.\n  This paper initiates the study of reflection and transparency. We formalize\ntheir definitions, propose a general method for proving that a transformation\nis transparent, and apply our method to different standard transformations.\nSubsequently, we present a transparent decompiler that combines seven XA\ntransformations and prove that it is sound and precise. Additionally, we review\nthe transparency of five existing tools and unveil violations in popular\nside-channel analysis frameworks and decompilers. Finally, we extend our\napproach to the setting of speculative side-channels.

We are concerned with the\ndependence of the FPs number and their stability on the distribution of\nrandomly initialized DNNs' weight matrices. Specifically, we consider the\ni.i.d. random weights with heavy and light-tail distributions. Our objectives\nare twofold. First, the dependence of FPs number and stability of FPs on the\ntype of the distribution tail. Second, the dependence of the number of FPs on\nthe DNNs' architecture. We perform extensive simulations and show that for\nlight tails (e.g., Gaussian), which are typically used for initialization, a\nsingle stable FP exists for broad types of architectures. In contrast, for\nheavy tail distributions (e.g., Cauchy), which typically appear in trained\nDNNs, a number of FPs emerge. We further observe that these FPs are stable\nattractors and their basins of attraction partition the domain of input\nvectors. Finally, we observe an intriguing non-monotone dependence of the\nnumber of fixed points $Q(L)$ on the DNNs' depth $L$. The above results were\nfirst obtained for untrained DNNs with two types of distributions at\ninitialization and then verified by considering DNNs in which the heavy tail\ndistributions arise in training.",

Large language models (LLMs) have become prominent\nin natural language processing (NLP) tasks and social media analysis, enabling\nlongitudinal studies of platforms like X (formerly Twitter) for specific issues\nduring COVID-19. We present an abuse detection and sentiment analysis framework\nthat offers a longitudinal analysis of Hinduphobia on X (Twitter) during and\nafter the COVID-19 pandemic. This framework assesses the prevalence and\nintensity of Hinduphobic discourse, capturing elements such as derogatory jokes\nand racist remarks through sentiment analysis and abuse detection from\npre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs. Additionally, we curate and publish a\n\"Hinduphobic COVID-19 X (Twitter) Dataset\" of 8,000 tweets annotated for\nHinduphobic abuse detection, which is used to fine-tune a BERT model, resulting\nin the development of the Hinduphobic BERT (HP-BERT) model.

These\ninsights provide valuable guidance for developing strategies to mitigate\ncommunal tensions in future crises, both locally and globally.

Our study identified network\ninteractions regulating glioma morphogenesis via the tumor-immune\nmicroenvironment, including neurodevelopmental programs, calcium dynamics, iron\nmetabolism, metabolic reprogramming, and feedback loops between MAPK/ERK and\nWNT signaling. These relationships highlight the emergence of a hybrid spectrum\nof cellular states navigating a disrupted neuro-differentiation hierarchy. We\nidentified transition genes such as DKK3, NOTCH2, GATAD1, GFAP, and SEZ6L in\nIDHWT glioblastoma, and H3F3A, ANXA6, HES6/7, SIRT2, FXYD6, PTPRZ1, MEIS1,\nCXXC5, and NDUFAB1 in K27M subtypes. We also identified MTRNR2L1, GAPDH, IGF2,\nFKBP variants, and FXYD7 as transition genes that influence cell fate\ndecision-making across both subsystems. Our findings suggest pHGGs are\ndevelopmentally trapped in states exhibiting maladaptive behaviors, and hybrid\ncellular identities. In effect, tumor heterogeneity (metastability) and\nplasticity emerge as stress-response patterns to immune-inflammatory\nmicroenvironments and oxidative stress. Furthermore, we show that pHGGs are\nsteered by developmental trajectories from radial glia predominantly favoring\nneocortical cell fates, in telencephalon and prefrontal cortex (PFC)\ndifferentiation. By addressing underlying patterning processes and plasticity\nnetworks as therapeutic vulnerabilities, our findings provide precision\nmedicine strategies aimed at modulating glioma cell fates and overcoming\ntherapeutic resistance.

    "abstract": "While deep-learning-enabled recommender systems demonstrate strong\nperformance benchmarks, many struggle to adapt effectively in real-world\nenvironments due to limited use of user-item relationship data and insufficient\ntransparency in recommendation generation. Traditional collaborative filtering\napproaches fail to integrate multifaceted item attributes, and although\nFactorization Machines account for item-specific details, they overlook broader\nrelational patterns. Collaborative knowledge graph-based models have progressed\nby embedding user-item interactions with item-attribute relationships, offering\na holistic perspective on interconnected entities. However, these models\nfrequently aggregate attribute and interaction data in an implicit manner,\nleaving valuable relational nuances underutilized.\n  This study introduces the Knowledge Graph Attention Network with Information\nFusion (KGIF), a specialized framework designed to merge entity and relation\nembeddings explicitly through a tailored self-attention mechanism. The KGIF\nframework integrates reparameterization via dynamic projection vectors,\nenabling embeddings to adaptively represent intricate relationships within\nknowledge graphs. This explicit fusion enhances the interplay between user-item\ninteractions and item-attribute relationships, providing a nuanced balance\nbetween user-centric and item-centric representations. An attentive propagation\nmechanism further optimizes knowledge graph embeddings, capturing multi-layered\ninteraction patterns. The contributions of this work include an innovative\nmethod for explicit information fusion, improved robustness for sparse\nknowledge graphs, and the ability to generate explainable recommendations\nthrough interpretable path visualization.",

These missions involve\nservicing spacecraft interacting with malfunctioning or defunct spacecraft\nunder challenging conditions, such as limited state information, measurement\ninaccuracies, and erratic target behaviors. Existing approaches often rely on\nassumptions of full state knowledge or single-integrator dynamics, which are\nimpractical for real-world applications involving second-order spacecraft\ndynamics. This work addresses these challenges by developing a distributed\nstate estimation and tracking framework that requires only relative position\nmeasurements and operates under partial state information. A novel\n$\\rho$-filter is introduced to reconstruct unknown states using locally\navailable information, and a Lyapunov-based deep neural network adaptive\ncontroller is developed that adaptively compensates for uncertainties stemming\nfrom unknown spacecraft dynamics. To ensure the collaborative spacecraft\nregulation problem is well-posed, a trackability condition is defined. A\nLyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to ensure exponential convergence\nof errors in state estimation and spacecraft regulation to a neighborhood of\nthe origin under the trackability condition.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Measuring the ortho-positronium (oPs) lifetime in human tissue bears\nthe potential of adding clinically relevant information about the tissue\nmicroenvironment to conventional positron emission tomography (PET). Through\nphantom measurements, we investigate the voxel-wise measurement of oPs lifetime\nusing a commercial long-axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET scanner. Methods: We\nprepared four samples with mixtures of Amberlite XAD4, a porous polymeric\nadsorbent, and water and added between 1.12 MBq and 1.44 MBq of $^{124}$I. The\nsamples were scanned in two different setups: once with a couple of centimeters\nbetween each sample (15 minutes scan time) and once with all samples taped\ntogether (40 minutes scan time). For each scan, we determine the oPs lifetime\nfor the full samples and at the voxel level. The voxel sizes under\nconsideration are $10.0^3$ mm$^3$, $7.1^3$ mm$^3$ and $4.0^3$ mm$^3$. Results:\nAmberlite XAD4 allows the preparation of samples with distinct oPs lifetime.\nUsing a Bayesian fitting procedure, the oPs lifetimes in the whole samples are\n$2.52 \\pm 0.03$ ns, $2.37\\pm 0.03$ ns, $2.27\\pm0.04$ ns and $1.82\\pm 0.02$ ns,\nrespectively. The voxel-wise oPs lifetime fits showed that even with $4.0^3$\nmm$^3$ voxels the samples are clearly distinguishable and a central voxels have\ngood count statistics. However, the situation with the samples close together\nremains challenging with respect to the spatial distinction of regions with\ndifferent oPs lifetimes. Conclusion: Our study shows that positronium lifetime\nimaging on a commercial LAFOV PET/CT should be feasible under clinical\nconditions using $^{124}$I.",

However, generating 4D-CBCT images with\nsufficient quality requires significantly more projection images than a\nstandard 3D-CBCT scan, leading to extended scanning times and increased imaging\ndose to the patient. To address these limitations, there is a strong demand for\nmethods capable of reconstructing high-quality 4D-CBCT images from a 1-minute\n3D-CBCT acquisition. The challenge lies in the sparse sampling of projections,\nwhich introduces severe streaking artifacts and compromises image quality. This\npaper introduces a novel framework leveraging spatiotemporal Gaussian\nrepresentation for 4D-CBCT reconstruction from sparse projections, achieving a\nbalance between streak artifact reduction, dynamic motion preservation, and\nfine detail restoration. Each Gaussian is characterized by its 3D position,\ncovariance, rotation, and density. Two-dimensional X-ray projection images can\nbe rendered from the Gaussian point cloud representation via X-ray\nrasterization. The properties of each Gaussian were optimized by minimizing the\ndiscrepancy between the measured projections and the rendered X-ray\nprojections. A Gaussian deformation network is jointly optimized to deform\nthese Gaussian properties to obtain a 4D Gaussian representation for dynamic\nCBCT scene modeling. The final 4D-CBCT images are reconstructed by voxelizing\nthe 4D Gaussians, achieving a high-quality representation that preserves both\nmotion dynamics and spatial detail.

It\nadmits a closed expression as a Schur-concave function of the state of the\nsubsystem having a form of nonadditive quantum entropy. We then construct a\nbipartite entanglement monotone for generic quantum states using the convex\nroof extension. Its normalized value is upper bounded by the concurrence of\nformation, and for two-qubit systems, they are equal. We also derive lower and\nupper bounds in terms of different forms of uncertainty in the subsystem\nquantified respectively by an extremal trace-norm asymmetry and a nonadditive\nquantum entropy.

    "abstract": "Gauge anomalous quantum field theories are inconsistent as full UV theories\nsince they lead to the breaking of Lorentz invariance or Unitarity, as well as\nnon-renormalizability. It is well known, however, that they can be interpreted\nas effective field theories (EFT) with a cut-off. The latter cannot be made\narbitrarily large and it is related to the energy scale at which additional\nfermions with suitable gauge charges enter, rendering the full model\nanomaly-free. A nondecoupling effect that remains in the EFT is the appearance\nof anomalous loop-induced triple-gauge couplings, encapsulating information\nfrom the full UV theory. In this work we take as an example an Abelian gauge\nsymmetry $U(1)'_\\mu$ under which $2^{nd}$-generation leptons are axially\ncharged, leading to an EFT that consists of the Standard Model (SM) with an\nadditional massive $Z'$ gauge boson. As a consequence, there are triple gauge\ncouplings involving the $Z'$ and Electroweak SM gauge bosons via mixed gauge\nanomalies. We study the possibility of probing these loop suppressed anomalous\ncouplings at hadron and lepton colliders, with $Z'$-lepton couplings allowed by\ncurrent experimental bounds, finding that due to the large SM backgrounds and\nsmall signal, the HL-LHC is incapable of this task. The 100 TeV $pp$ collider\nat $\\mathcal{L}=20~\\mathrm {ab}^{-1}$ on the other hand could probe anomalous\ncouplings for $m_{Z'}\\in[150,800]~\\mathrm{GeV}$ and obtain discovery\nsignificances for $m_{Z'}\\in[230,330]~\\mathrm{GeV}$.

    "abstract": "The ability to distribute heralded entanglement between distant matter nodes\nis a primitive for the implementation of large-scale quantum networks. Some of\nthe most crucial requirements for future applications include high heralding\nrates at telecom wavelengths, multiplexed operation and on-demand retrieval of\nstored excitations for synchronization of separate quantum links. Despite\ntremendous progress in various physical systems, the demonstration of\ntelecom-heralded entanglement between quantum nodes featuring both multiplexed\noperation and on-demand retrieval remains elusive. In this work, we combine\nnarrowband parametric photon-pair sources and solid-state quantum memories\nbased on rare-earth doped crystals to demonstrate telecom heralded entanglement\nbetween spatially separated spin-wave quantum memories with fully adjustable\nrecall time and temporal multiplexing of 15 modes. In a first experiment, the\nstorage in the spin-state is conditioned on the entanglement heralding. We take\nadvantage of the control over readout pulse phase to achieve feed-forward\nconditional phase-shifts on the stored photons depending on which heralding\ndetector clicked. We exploit this effect to double the entanglement heralding\nrate for a given quantum state up to \\SI{500}{\\cps}, with a measured positive\nconcurrence by up to 6 standard deviations. In a second experiment, we simulate\nthe communication time of a long-distance link by implementing an unconditional\nstorage scheme with a dead-time of \\SI{100}{\\micro\\second}, leading to an\nentanglement rate of \\SI{22}{\\cps} per heralding detector, increased by a\nfactor of 15 thanks to temporal multiplexing. These results establish our\narchitecture as a prime candidate for the implementation of scalable high-rate\nquantum network links.",

Here, we theoretically study multiple testing issues that arise from\ndetecting changes in many streams. We point out that any algorithm with finite\naverage run length (ARL) must have a trivial worst-case false detection rate\n(FDR), family-wise error rate (FWER), per-family error rate (PFER), and global\nerror rate (GER); thus, any attempt to control these Type I error metrics is\nfundamentally in conflict with the desire for a finite ARL (which is typically\nnecessary in order to have a small detection delay). One of our contributions\nis to define a new class of metrics which can be controlled, called error over\npatience (EOP). We propose algorithms that combine the recent e-detector\nframework (which generalizes the Shiryaev-Roberts and CUSUM methods) with the\nrecent e-Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and e-Bonferroni procedures. We prove\nthat these algorithms control the EOP at any desired level under very general\ndependence structures on the data within and across the streams. In fact, we\nprove a more general error control that holds uniformly over all stopping times\nand provides a smooth trade-off between the conflicting metrics. Additionally,\nif finiteness of the ARL is forfeited, we show that our algorithms control the\nworst-case Type I error.",

However, an important\nshortcoming of current realizations is that large voltages are required for\nuseful actuation strains. This work proposes, and demonstrates through theory\nand numerical simulations, a strategy to achieve large and controlled actuation\nby exploiting the electromechanical analog of the Treloar-Kearsley (TK)\ninstability. The key idea is to use the fact that the TK instability is a\nsymmetry-breaking bifurcation, which implies the existence of a symmetry-driven\nconstant-energy region in the energy landscape. This provides for nonlinear\nsoft modes with large deformations that can be accessed with very small\nexternal stimulus, which is achieved here by applying a small in-plane electric\nfield. First, the bifurcation and post-bifurcation behavior of the\nelectromechanical TK instability are established theoretically in the idealized\nsetting of uniform deformation and electric field. Next, building on this, a\nfinite element analysis of a realistic geometry with patterned top and bottom\nelectrodes is applied to demonstrate large and soft shape changes driven by\nsmall voltage differences across the electrodes.",

Each framework has its\nunique strengths, and their intersection offers promising opportunities for\ntackling a broad class of problems, particularly in the context of impulse\ncontrols and decision-making in complex systems.\n  The relationship between PDMPs and MDPs is a natural subject of exploration,\nas embedding impulse control problems for PDMPs into the MDP framework could\nopen new avenues for their analysis and resolution. Specifically, this\nintegration would allow leveraging the computational and theoretical tools\ndeveloped for MDPs to address the challenges inherent in PDMPs.

To simplify the tasks of needle\ninsertion and pneumo-dissection in this technique, we previously developed an\nOptical Coherence Tomography (OCT)-guided, eye-mountable robot that uses\nreal-time tracking of corneal layers from M-mode OCT signals for control.\nHowever, signal noise and instability during manipulation of the OCT fiber\nsensor-integrated needle have hindered the performance of conventional\ndeep-learning segmentation methods, resulting in rough and inaccurate detection\nof corneal layers.

This approach effectively\nreduces the effects of noise and improves segmentation speed, precision, and\nstability. Validation using in vivo, ex vivo, and hybrid rabbit eye datasets\ndemonstrates that our method outperforms traditional loss-based techniques,\nproviding fast, accurate, and robust segmentation of the epithelium and DM to\nguide surgery.",

This study evaluates four distinct photo-z\nestimators-ANNz2, BPZ, ENF, and DNF-using the Dark Energy Survey Y3 BAO Sample.\nUnlike most studies, we explore selecting optimal galaxies based on their\nredshift Probability Distribution Function (PDF) by either reducing noise or\nidentifying those approximating a Gaussian distribution. We cross-matched\n25,760 galaxies drawn from four spectroscopic surveys with the photo-z sample\nto comprehend redshift bias and its 68th percentile $\\sigma_{68}$. The lowest\n$\\sigma$ for all estimators was found in the range $0.79<z_p<0.85$. Among the\nestimators, DMF exhibited the greatest bias, while ENF, ANNz2, and BPZ showed\ndecreased precision outside 0.7 to 0.9 redshift range. To select galaxies with\nminimal bias, ANNz2 emerged as the most reliable algorithm across all criteria.\nPDFs selection significantly improves colour representation over the\nspectroscopic sample, underscoring the role of magnitude space in selection.\nWhile ANNz2 achieved superior precision, ENF poorly selected Gaussian PDFs,\nleaving few galaxies for LSS evaluation. Despite smooth PDFs, catastrophic\nredshift errors were present. Though DNF had the poorest precision, it offered\nenough galaxies for cosmological use. Subsampling galaxies with secondary peaks\nless than 30\\% of the main peak height, termed Small Peaks, showed ANNz2\nexcelled.

The PSS\nmodel is based on the interplay of six key components: cumulative knowledge,\nintelligence, technological synergy, quantum information, social dynamics, and\nenvironmental sustainability. The interaction of these variables is described\nthrough a system of nonlinear differential equations, reflecting the complex\nfeedback loops and synergetic effects characteristic of the postsingular world.\nA differentiation table contrasting postsingular and classical science is also\npresented, highlighting the most fundamental differences between contemporary\nclassical science and future postsingular science. The model emphasizes the\nsynergy between humans and artificial intelligence, the role of quantum\ntechnologies in accelerating scientific discovery, and the impact of social and\necological factors that either constrain or stimulate scientific progress. It\nis anticipated that new forms of scientific information dissemination will\nreplace traditional academic publications and that scientific processing will\nreach an entirely new level of development following the singularity-driven\nacceleration of technological progress and the integration of AI into R&D. This\nwill herald an era of nonstop, ultrarapid science operating 24/7.

    "abstract": "HR~6819 is the first post-mass transfer binary system composed of a classical\nBe star and a bloated pre-subdwarf stripped star directly confirmed by\ninterferometry. While the Be star is already spun up to near-critical rotation\nand possesses a self-ejected viscous Keplerian disk, the stripped star is found\nin a short-lived evolutionary stage, in which it retains the spectral\nappearance of a B-type main-sequence star while contracting into a faint\nsubdwarf OB-type star. In order to understand the evolution of\nintermediate-mass interacting binaries, the fundamental parameters of\ncornerstone objects such as HR~6819 need to be known. We aim to obtain orbital\nparameters and model-independent dynamical masses of this binary system to\nquantitatively characterize this rarely observed evolutionary stage. We\nanalyzed a time series of 12 interferometric near-IR $K$-band observations from\nVLTI/GRAVITY with the help of the geometrical model-fitting tool PMOIRED. We\nincluded recently published radial velocities based on FEROS high-resolution\nspectroscopy for the binary orbital solution. With the GRAVITY data, we\nobtained the astrometric orbit, relative fluxes of the components, and\nparameters of the circumstellar disk of the Be star; we also detected helium\nline signatures from the stripped star. Using the published radial velocities\nenabled us to obtain the dynamical masses of the components as well as the\ndynamical parallax. The Be star is the slightly brighter component in the $K$\nband and is almost 16 times as massive as the bloated stripped star, with the\nindividual dynamical masses being $4.24\\pm0.31 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ for the Be star\nand $0.270\\pm0.056 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ for the stripped star. The orbit is\nslightly eccentric, with $e=0.0289\\pm0.0058$, and the semimajor axis of the\norbit is $0.3800\\pm0.0093$ AU. (Abstract continues but does not fit here)",

These methods often employ a two-step strategy that first creates\naugmented environments and subsequently identifies invariant subgraphs to\nimprove generalizability. Nevertheless, this approach could be suboptimal from\nthe perspective of consistency. First, the process of augmenting environments\nby altering the graphs while preserving labels may lead to graphs that are not\nrealistic or meaningfully related to the origin distribution, thus lacking\ndistribution consistency. Second, the extracted subgraphs are obtained from\ndirectly modifying graphs, and may not necessarily maintain a consistent\npredictive relationship with their labels, thereby impacting label consistency.\nIn response to these challenges, we introduce an innovative approach that aims\nto enhance these two types of consistency for graph OOD generalization. We\npropose a modifier to obtain both augmented and invariant graphs in a unified\nmanner. With the augmented graphs, we enrich the training data without\ncompromising the integrity of label-graph relationships. The label consistency\nenhancement in our framework further preserves the supervision information in\nthe invariant graph.

This approach uses a\ndisplacement strategy for noisy data points, computing the average distance to\ntheir neighbors and moving them closer to their centroids. Random oversampling\nis then performed to achieve dataset balance. Extensive evaluations compare 14\nalternatives on nine classifiers across synthetic and 20 real-world datasets\nwith varying imbalance ratios.

Here, we present a statistical\nstudy of dust formation in 40 novae with high-quality optical/IR light curves,\nquantitatively distinguishing dust-forming from non-dust-forming novae while\nexploring the properties of the dust events. We find that 50-70% of novae\nproduce dust, significantly higher than previous estimates. Dust-forming novae\ncan be separated from those that do not show dust formation by using the\nlargest redward ($V-K$) colour change from peak visible brightness; ($V-J$) or\n($V-H$) offer useful but less sensitive constraints. This makes optical+IR\nphotometry a powerful tool to quantify dust formation in novae. We find that\nnovae detected in GeV $\\gamma$-rays by \\emph{Fermi}-LAT appear to form dust\nmore often than novae not detected by \\emph{Fermi}, implying a possible\nconnection between $\\gamma$-ray producing shocks and dust production. We also\nfind that novae that evolve very quickly ($t_2 < 10$ days) are much less likely\nto form dust, in agreement with previous findings. We confirm a correlation\nbetween $t_2$ and the time of the onset of dust formation (which occurs $\\sim$1\nweek--3 months after maximum light), but conclude that it is primarily an\nobservational artifact driven by dust formation determining when a nova drops 2\nmag below peak.

We find correlated variability at 2.1\nand 4.8 micron in all epochs, continual short-time scale (a few seconds)\nvariability and epoch-to-epoch variable emission implying long-term ( ~days to\nmonths) variability of Sgr A*. A highlight of this analysis is the evidence for\nsub-minute, horizon-scale time variability of Sgr A*, probing inner accretion\ndisk size scales. The power spectra of the light curves in each observing epoch\nalso indicate long-term variable emission. With continuous observations, JWST\ndata suggest that the flux of Sgr A* is fluctuating constantly. The flux\ndensity correlation exhibits a distinct break in the slope at ~3 mJy at 2.1\nmicron. The analysis indicates two different processes contributing to the\nvariability of Sgr A*. Brighter emission trends towards shallower spectral\nindices than the fainter emission. Cross correlation of the light curves\nindicates for the first time, a time delay of 3 - 40 sec in the 4.8 micron\nvariability with respect to 2.1 micron. This phase shift leads to loops in\nplots of flux density vs spectral index as the emission rises and falls.\nModeling suggests that the synchrotron emission from the evolving,\nage-stratified electron population reproduces the shape of the observed light\ncurves with a direct estimate of the magnetic field strengths in the range\nbetween 40-90 G, and upper cutoff energy, E_c, between 420 and 720 MeV.",

Our resolved star\nanalysis reveals a large, low surface brightness stellar stream\n($M_{V}\\sim-8.5$; [Fe/H] $= -1.4\\pm0.15$) extending more than 40 kpc north from\nthe galaxy's center. We also find other halo structures, including potentially\nan additional stream wrap to the south, which may be associated with the main\nstream. The morphology and derived low metallicities of the streams and shells\ndiscovered surrounding NGC 300 are highly suggestive of a past accretion event.\nAssuming a single progenitor, the accreted system is approximately Fornax-like\nin luminosity, with an inferred mass ratio to NGC 300 of approximately $1:15$.\nWe also present the discovery of a metal-poor globular cluster\n($R_{\\rm{proj}}=23.3$~kpc; $M_{V}=-8.99\\pm0.16$; [Fe/H] $\\approx-1.6\\pm0.6$) in\nthe halo of NGC 300, the furthest identified globular cluster associated with\nNGC 300. The stellar structures around NGC 300 represent the richest features\nobserved in a Magellanic Cloud analog to date, strongly supporting the idea\nthat accretion and subsequent disruption is an important mechanism in the\nassembly of dwarf galaxy stellar halos.",

In the literature, mostly random circuits with\nHaar-distributed gate operations have been considered. In this work, we\ninvestigate operator spreading in random unitary circuits in which the\nelementary gate operations are drawn from general unitary-invariant ensembles,\nwhich include the well-studied Haar-distributed random unitary circuits as a\nspecial case. Similar to the Haar-distributed case, the long-time behavior of\noperator spreading with the more general unitary-invariant gate distribution is\ngoverned by drift-diffusion equations characterized by the butterfly velocity\n$v_{\\rm B}$ and a diffusion constant $\\mathcal{D}$. Differences with the\nHaar-random case are (i) that it takes a finite time $\\tau_{\\rm b}$ until\nensemble-averaged Pauli-string weights take a ``binary'' form, in which they\ndepend only on whether Pauli operators inside the support of the Pauli strong\nare equal to the identity matrix, and (ii) that the operator spreading is\ncharacterized by a finite ``domain-wall width'' $n_{\\rm DW}$ separating regions\nwith a random-matrix-like Pauli-string distribution. To illustrate these\nfindings, we perform explicit calculations for random unitary circuits\ndistributed according to the Poisson kernel, which interpolates between the\ntrivial and Haar-distributed circuits.",

Here, we present the first\napplication of this method to optical spectra of low-mass X-ray binaries. We\nuse high-time-resolution data of the black hole transient V404 Cygni, obtained\nwith the \\textit{Gran Telescopio Canarias} during its 2015 outburst. During\nthis event, conspicuous wind-related features, such as P-Cygni profiles, were\ndetected in the flux spectra. We find that rms spectra are rich in spectral\nfeatures, although they are typically morphologically different from their flux\ncounterparts. Specifically, we typically observe absorption components in\ncorrespondence to the presence of emission lines in the flux spectra.\nSimilarly, when analysing segments with significant variability in the optical\nflux, P-Cygni line profiles appear inverted in the rms spectra (i.e., enhanced\nvariability in the blue-shifted region, accompanied by a decrease in that\nassociated with the red component). We discuss the possible origin of these\nfeatures, which resemble those found in other objects, such as active galactic\nnuclei.

We investigate the\nradial profiles of the ages, metallicities and star formation histories of four\nglobular cluster (GC) rich LSB dwarfs, newly observed within the 'Analysis of\nGalaxies At The Extremes' (AGATE) collaboration. DFX1 and DF07 are bona-fide\nUDGs, while PUDG-R27 and VCC1448 are nearly UDGs (NUDGes). Comparing their and\nDF44's results to simulations, we aim to reveal their formation pathways. We\nuse pPXF to fit different spectra extracted in annular apertures to recover the\nstellar population properties and compute their gradients. We compare those\nwith a sample of literature classical dwarfs and simulations, in particular\nwith simulated UDGs. Our five LSB dwarfs present flat age and flat-to-rising\nmetallicity profiles. The flat age gradients are compatible with those of\nclassical dwarfs (both observed and from cosmological simulations), but the\nmetallicity gradient diverges. All of our LSB dwarfs (except for PUDG-R27,\nshowing a pronounced increasing metallicity profile) are compatible with being\nthe extreme tail of the age-metallicity gradient relation, with a preference to\nco-eval formation forming the galaxy all at once. This sample of GC-rich LSB\ndwarfs with spatially resolved properties confirms that they seem to follow a\ndifferent formation path than classical dwarfs. However, larger samples with\nhigher S/N spectra and varying amounts of GC richness are required to set\nrobust constraints on the formation pathways of LSB dwarf galaxies.",

Despite its low luminosity,\nits post-peak light-curve decline rate ($\\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.35\\pm0.09$ mag) and\ncolor-stretch parameter (sBV>0.82) are similar to normal SNe Ia, making it an\noutlier in the luminosity-width and luminosity-color-stretch relations. Early\nlight curves suggest a \"bump\" during the first 1.4 days of explosion.\nASASSN-20jq synthesized a low radioactive $^{56}$Ni mass of\n$0.09\\pm0.01M_\\odot$. Near-maximum light spectra reveal strong Si II absorption\nlines, indicating a cooler photosphere than normal SNe Ia, but lack Ti II\nabsorption lines. Unusually strong O I $\\lambda$7773 and Ca II near-infrared\ntriplet absorption features are present. Nebular spectra show a strong, narrow\nforbidden [Ca II] $\\lambda\\lambda$7291,7324 doublet emission, rarely seen in\nSNe Ia except in some Type Iax events. Marginal detection of [O I]\n$\\lambda\\lambda$6300,6364 doublet emission, which is extremely rare, is\nobserved. Both [Ca II] and [O I] lines are redshifted by $\\sim2000$ km/s.

This distinguishes ASASSN-20jq from normal\nand subluminous SNe Ia. ASASSN-20jq's light curve and spectra do not align with\nany single SNe Ia subclass but show similarities to 2002es-like objects.

    "abstract": "We present an analysis of the X-ray properties of the galaxy cluster\npopulation in the z=0 snapshot of the IllustrisTNG simulations, utilizing\nmachine learning techniques to perform clustering and regression tasks. We\nexamine five properties of the hot gas (the central cooling time, the central\nelectron density, the central entropy excess, the concentration parameter, and\nthe cuspiness) which are commonly used as classification metrics to identify\ncool core (CC), weak cool core (WCC) and non cool core (NCC) clusters of\ngalaxies. Using mock Chandra X-ray images as inputs, we first explore an\nunsupervised clustering scheme to see how the resulting groups correlate with\nthe CC/WCC/NCC classification based on the different criteria. We observe that\nthe groups replicate almost exactly the separation of the galaxy cluster images\nwhen classifying them based on the concentration parameter. We then move on to\na regression task, utilizing a ResNet model to predict the value of all five\nproperties. The network is able to achieve a mean percentage error of 1.8% for\nthe central cooling time, and a balanced accuracy of 0.83 on the concentration\nparameter, making them the best-performing metrics. Finally, we use\nsimulation-based inference (SBI) to extract posterior distributions for the\nnetwork predictions. Our neural network simultaneously predicts all five\nclassification metrics using only mock Chandra X-ray images.\n  This study demonstrates that machine learning is a viable approach for\nanalyzing and classifying the large galaxy cluster datasets that will soon\nbecome available through current and upcoming X-ray surveys, such as eROSITA.",

However, key details such as the timescale of synchronization,\nefficiency of tidal dissipation, rotational period, and dependence on stellar\nmass are not well constrained. We present a catalog of rotation periods,\norbital periods, and eccentricities from eclipsing binaries (EBs) that can be\nused to study the role of tides in the rotational evolution of low-mass dwarf\n(FGKM spectral type) binaries. This study presents the largest catalog of EB\norbital and rotational periods (Porb and Prot) measured from the Transiting\nExoplanet Satellite Survey (TESS). We first classify 4584 light curves from the\nTESS Eclipsing Binary Catalog according to out-of-eclipse stellar variability\ntype: starspot modulation, ellipsoidal variability, non-periodic variability,\nand \"other\" variability (e.g. pulsations). We then manually validate each light\ncurve classification, resulting in a sample of 1039 candidates with 584\nhigh-confidence EBs that exhibit detectable star-spot modulation. From there,\nwe measure and compare the rotation period of each starspot-modulated EB using\nthree methods: Lomb-Scargle periodograms, autocorrelation function, and phase\ndispersion minimization. We find that our period distributions are consistent\nwith previous work that used a sample of 816 starspot EBs from Kepler to\nidentify two populations: a synchronous population (with Porb~Prot) and a\nsubsynchronous population (with 8Porb~7Prot). Using Bayesian model comparison,\nwe find that a bimodal distribution is a significantly better fit than a\nunimodal distribution for Kepler and TESS samples, both individually or\ncombined, confirming that the subsynchronous population is statistically\nsignificant.",

For a Neptune-class FFP in the\nGalactic disk with a Sun-like star as the microlensed source, CSST can detect\nEarth-mass satellites over a decade of separations (from ~0.01 to ~0.1 AU) and\nhas sensitivity down to Moon-mass satellites (q~1e-3) at s~1. CSST also has\nsome sensitivity to detect Moon-mass satellites at s~2 (~0.02 AU) orbiting an\nEarth-mass FFP in the disk. CSST has substantially reduced sensitivity for\ndetecting satellites when the source star is an M dwarf, compared to a Sun-like\nsource.

This new version of zELDA focuses on disentangling\nthe galactic from the IGM effects. We build realistic Lya line profiles that\ninclude the ISM and IGM contributions, by combining the Monte Carlo radiative\ntransfer simulations for the so called \"shell model\" (ISM) and IGM transmission\ncurves generated from IllustrisTNG100. We use these mock line profiles to train\ndifferent artificial neural networks.

We measure the\naccuracy of zELDA on mock Lya line profiles. We find that zELDA is capable of\nreconstructing the ISM emerging Lya line profile with high accuracy\n(Kolmogorov-Smirnov<0.1) for 95% of the cases for HST COS-like observations and\n80% for MUSE-WIDE-like. zELDA is able to measure the IGM transmission with the\ntypical uncertainties below 10% for HST-COS and MUSE-WIDE data.

In contrast, in this paper, we present NeRF-MD, a method\nwhich shows that NeRFs can be considered as mirror detectors and which is\ncapable of reconstructing neural radiance fields of scenes containing mirroring\nsurfaces without the need for prior annotations. To this end, we first compute\nan initial estimate of the scene geometry by training a standard NeRF using a\ndepth reprojection loss. Our key insight lies in the fact that parts of the\nscene corresponding to a mirroring surface will still exhibit a significant\nphotometric inconsistency, whereas the remaining parts are already\nreconstructed in a plausible manner. This allows us to detect mirror surfaces\nby fitting geometric primitives to such inconsistent regions in this initial\nstage of the training. Using this information, we then jointly optimize the\nradiance field and mirror geometry in a second training stage to refine their\nquality. We demonstrate the capability of our method to allow the faithful\ndetection of mirrors in the scene as well as the reconstruction of a single\nconsistent scene representation, and demonstrate its potential in comparison to\nbaseline and mirror-aware approaches.",

    "abstract": "This work presents Sa2VA, the first unified model for dense grounded\nunderstanding of both images and videos. Unlike existing multi-modal large\nlanguage models, which are often limited to specific modalities and tasks,\nSa2VA supports a wide range of image and video tasks, including referring\nsegmentation and conversation, with minimal one-shot instruction tuning. Sa2VA\ncombines SAM-2, a foundation video segmentation model, with LLaVA, an advanced\nvision-language model, and unifies text, image, and video into a shared LLM\ntoken space. Using the LLM, Sa2VA generates instruction tokens that guide SAM-2\nin producing precise masks, enabling a grounded, multi-modal understanding of\nboth static and dynamic visual content. Additionally, we introduce Ref-SAV, an\nauto-labeled dataset containing over 72k object expressions in complex video\nscenes, designed to boost model performance. We also manually validate 2k video\nobjects in the Ref-SAV datasets to benchmark referring video object\nsegmentation in complex environments. Experiments show that Sa2VA achieves\nstate-of-the-art across multiple tasks, particularly in referring video object\nsegmentation, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Human Sensing, a field that leverages technology to monitor human activities,\npsycho-physiological states, and interactions with the environment, enhances\nour understanding of human behavior and drives the development of advanced\nservices that improve overall quality of life. However, its reliance on\ndetailed and often privacy-sensitive data as the basis for its machine learning\n(ML) models raises significant legal and ethical concerns. The recently\nproposed ML approach of Federated Learning (FL) promises to alleviate many of\nthese concerns, as it is able to create accurate ML models without sending raw\nuser data to a central server. While FL has demonstrated its usefulness across\na variety of areas, such as text prediction and cyber security, its benefits in\nHuman Sensing are under-explored, given the particular challenges in this\ndomain. This survey conducts a comprehensive analysis of the current\nstate-of-the-art studies on FL in Human Sensing, and proposes a taxonomy and an\neight-dimensional assessment for FL approaches. Through the eight-dimensional\nassessment, we then evaluate whether the surveyed studies consider a specific\nFL-in-Human-Sensing challenge or not. Finally, based on the overall analysis,\nwe discuss open challenges and highlight five research aspects related to FL in\nHuman Sensing that require urgent research attention. Our work provides a\ncomprehensive corpus of FL studies and aims to assist FL practitioners in\ndeveloping and evaluating solutions that effectively address the real-world\ncomplexities of Human Sensing.",

    "abstract": "Indian languages are inflectional and agglutinative and typically follow\nclause-free word order. The structure of sentences across most major Indian\nlanguages are similar when their dependency parse trees are considered. While\nsome differences in the parsing structure occur due to peculiarities of a\nlanguage or its preferred natural way of conveying meaning, several apparent\ndifferences are simply due to the granularity of representation of the smallest\nsemantic unit of processing in a sentence. The semantic unit is typically a\nword, typographically separated by whitespaces. A single whitespace-separated\nword in one language may correspond to a group of words in another. Hence,\ngrouping of words based on semantics helps unify the parsing structure of\nparallel sentences across languages and, in the process, morphology. In this\nwork, we propose word grouping as a major preprocessing step for any\ncomputational or linguistic processing of sentences for Indian languages. Among\nIndian languages, since Hindi is one of the least agglutinative, we expect it\nto benefit the most from word-grouping. Hence, in this paper, we focus on Hindi\nto study the effects of grouping. We perform quantitative assessment of our\nproposal with an intrinsic method that perturbs sentences by shuffling words as\nwell as an extrinsic evaluation that verifies the importance of word grouping\nfor the task of Machine Translation (MT) using decomposed prompting. We also\nqualitatively analyze certain aspects of the syntactic structure of sentences.\nOur experiments and analyses show that the proposed grouping technique brings\nuniformity in the syntactic structures, as well as aids underlying NLP tasks.",

Given a maximum number\nof observations $N$, one may believe this must come at the cost of power when\ncompared to a conventional test that waits until all $N$ observations have\narrived. Our first contribution is to show that this is false: for any valid\ntest based on $N$ observations, we derive an anytime valid sequential test that\nmatches it after $N$ observations. Our second contribution is that the outcome\nof a continuously-interpreted test can be used as a significance level in\nsubsequent testing, leading to an overall procedure that is valid at the\noriginal significance level. This shows anytime validity and optional\ncontinuation are readily available in traditional testing, without requiring\nexplicit use of e-values. We illustrate this by deriving the anytime valid\nsequentialized $z$-test and $t$-test, which at time $N$ coincide with the\ntraditional $z$-test and $t$-test. Lastly, we show the popular log-optimal\nsequential $z$-test can be interpreted as desiring a rejection by the\ntraditional $z$-test at some tiny significance level in the distant future.",

We find that this phase can be\nseparately detected from the other phases such as the many-body ergodic (ME)\nand many-body localized (MBL) phases in the model through supervised neural\nnetworks made for both binary and multi-class classification tasks, utilizing,\nrather un-preprocessed, eigenvalue spacings and eigenvector probability\ndensities as input features. Moreover, the output of our trained neural\nnetworks can also indicate the critical points separating ME, MBC and MBL\nphases, which are consistent with the same obtained from other conventional\nmethods. We also employ unsupervised learning techniques, particularly\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) of eigenvector probability densities to\ninvestigate how this framework, without any training, captures the, rather\nunknown, many-body phases (ME, MBL and MBC) and single particle phases\n(delocalized, localized and critical) of the interacting and non-interacting\nsystems, respectively. Our findings reveal that PCA entropy serves as an\neffective indicator (order parameter) for detecting phase transitions in the\nsingle-particle systems. Moreover, this method proves applicable to many-body\nsystems when the data undergoes a suitable pre-processing. Interestingly, when\nit comes to extraction of critical (correlation length) exponents through a\nfinite size-scaling, we find that for single-particle systems, scaling collapse\nof neural network outputs is obtained using components of inverse participation\nratio (IPR) as input data. Remarkably, we observe identical critical exponents\nas obtained from scaling collapse of the IPR directly for different\nsingle-particle phase transitions.",

We emphasize that the\nmethod proposed here never requires solving this nonlinear equation; instead, a\nsuitable linearization is derived. To address this issue, we propose an\nextension of the well-known hydrostatic reconstruction. By appropriately\ndefining the reconstructed states at the interfaces, any numerical flux\nfunction, combined with a relevant source term discretization, produces a\nwell-balanced scheme that preserves both moving and non-moving steady\nsolutions. This eliminates the need to construct specific numerical fluxes.\nAdditionally, we prove that the resulting scheme is consistent with the\nhomogeneous system on flat topographies, and that it reduces to the hydrostatic\nreconstruction when the velocity vanishes.

Our proof of\nperfectoidness for covers of abelian varieties is based on results of Scholze\non the canonical subgroup and holds for an arbitrary abelian variety over an\nalgebraically closed non-archimedean extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_p$. In an\nappendix authored by Tongmu He, an alternate proof is presented in the case of\nabelian varieties that can be defined over a discretely valued subfield by\ncombining our computation of the geometric Sen morphism with previous pointwise\nperfectoidness and purity of perfectoidness results of He.",

It remains\nunclear whether, for such a range of operating conditions, the stiffness of the\nelastic elements needs to be varied or if a similar performance can be obtained\nby changing the motion and actuation while keeping the stiffness fixed. This\nwork explores the influence of the leg stiffness on the energy efficiency of a\nmonopedal robot through an extensive parametric study of its periodic hopping\nmotion. To this end, we formulate an optimal control problem parameterized by\naverage forward speed and leg stiffness, solving it numerically using direct\ncollocation.

The construction gives a putatively complete list of SICs with\nWeyl-Heisenberg symmetry in all dimensions d > 3. Specifically, we give an\nexplicit expression for an object we call a ghost SIC, which is constructed\nfrom the real multiplication values of a special function and which is Galois\nconjugate to a SIC. The special function, the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle,\nis more precisely a tuple of meromorphic functions indexed by a congruence\nsubgroup of ${\\rm SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. We prove our construction gives a valid\nSIC in every case assuming two conjectures: the order 1 abelian Stark\nconjecture for real quadratic fields and a special value identity for the\nShintani-Faddeev modular cocycle. The former allows us to prove that the ghost\nand the SIC are Galois conjugate over an extension of\n$\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ where $\\Delta = (d+1)(d-3)$, while the latter\nallows us to prove idempotency of the presumptive fiducial projector. We\nprovide computational tests of our SIC construction by cross-validating it with\nknown solutions, particularly the extensive work of Scott and Grassl, and by\nconstructing four numerical examples of nonequivalent SICs in d=100, three of\nwhich are new. We further consider rank-r generalizations called r-SICs given\nby maximal equichordal configurations of r-dimensional complex subspaces. We\ngive similar conditional constructions for r-SICs for all r, d such that r(d-r)\ndivides $(d^2-1)$. Finally, we study the structure of the field extensions\nconjecturally generated by the r-SICs. If K is any real quadratic field, then\neither every abelian Galois extension of K, or else every abelian extension for\nwhich 2 is unramified, is generated by our construction; the former holds for a\npositive density of field discriminants.",

A physics-based forward model\nthat relates the signal with the observations is typically needed.\nUnfortunately, unknown model parameters and imperfect forward models can\nundermine the signal recovery. Even though supervised machine learning offers\npromising avenues to improve the robustness of the solutions, we have to rely\non model-based learning when there is no access to ground truth for the\ntraining. Here, we studied a linear inverse problem that included an unknown\nnon-linear model parameter and utilized a Bayesian model-based learning\napproach that allowed signal recovery and subsequently estimation of the model\nparameter. This approach, called Bayesian Approximation Error approach,\nemployed a simplified model of the physics of the problem augmented with an\napproximation error term that compensated for the simplification. An error\nsubspace was spanned with the help of the eigenvectors of the approximation\nerror covariance matrix which allowed, alongside the primary signal,\nsimultaneous estimation of the induced error. The estimated error and signal\nwere then used to determine the unknown model parameter. For the model\nparameter estimation, we tested different approaches: a conditional Gaussian\nregression, an iterative (model-based) optimization, and a Gaussian process\nthat was modeled with the help of physics-informed learning. In addition,\nalternating optimization was used as a reference method. As an example\napplication, we focused on the problem of reconstructing brain activity from\nEEG recordings under the condition that the electrical conductivity of the\npatient's skull was unknown in the model.

Recently, a\nprecision measurement of the Deuterium (D) abundance in CR in the 2-21 GV\nrigidity range provided by the AMS02 experiment unexpectedly detected an excess\nof D with respect to its expected secondary nature, opening the field for new\nmeasurements at high rigidity to determine how the spectrum evolves and whether\nthere is confirmation of a primary or primary plus secondary origin.

By considering\nevaluation codes based on skew polynomials, a condition on the existence of\noptimal support-constrained codes is derived and an application of such codes\nin the distributed multi-source networks is proposed. For a class of multicast\nnetworks, the advantage of vector network coding compared to scalar network\ncoding is investigated.

A new class of bivariate\nevaluation codes and their local recovery capability are studied.\nInterestingly, the well-known Reed-Solomon codes are used in a class of locally\nrecoverable codes with availability (multiple disjoint recovery sets) via\nsubspace design. Aside from new constructions, decoding approaches are\nconsidered in order to increase the error correction capability in the case\nwhere the code is fixed.

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of rarefied gas dynamics is crucial for optimizing flows\nthrough microelectromechanical systems, air filtration devices, and shale gas\nextraction. Traditional methods, such as discrete velocity and direct\nsimulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), demand intensive memory and computation,\nespecially for microflows in non-convex domains. Recently, physics-informed\nneural networks emerged as a meshless and adaptable alternative for solving\nnon-linear partial differential equations. We trained a PINN using a limited\nnumber of DSMC-generated rarefied gas microflows in the transition regime with\nKnudsen number from 0.1 to 3, incorporating continuity and Cauchy momentum\nexchange equations in the loss function. The PINN achieved under 2 percent\nerror on these residuals and effectively filtered DSMC intrinsic statistical\nnoise. Predictions remained strong for a tested flow field with Kn equal to\n0.7, and showed limited extrapolation performance on a flow field with Kn equal\nto 5 with a local overshoot of about 20 percent, while maintaining physical\nconsistency. Notably, each DSMC field required about 20 hours on 4 graphics\nprocessing units (GPU), while the PINN training took less than 2 hours on one\nGPU, with evaluations under 2 seconds.",

This paper\ninvestigates the alignment between state-of-the-art LLMs and human annotators\nin detecting elements of relevance within home environment scenarios. We\ncreated a set of twelve images depicting various domestic scenarios and\nenlisted fourteen annotators to identify the key element in each image.

    "abstract": "We report pattern formation in an otherwise non-uniform and unsteady flow\narising in high-speed liquid entrainment conditions on the outer wall of a wide\nrotating drum. We show that the coating flow in this rotary drag-out undergoes\naxial modulations to form an array of roughly vertical thin liquid sheets which\nslowly drift from the middle of the drum towards its side walls. Thus, the\nnumber of sheets fluctuate in time such that the most probable rib spacing\nvaries ever so slightly with the speed, and a little less weakly with the\nviscosity. We propose that these axial patterns are generated due to a primary\ninstability driven by an adverse pressure gradient in the meniscus region of\nthe rotary drag-out flow, similar to the directional Saffman-Taylor\ninstability, as is well-known for ribbing in film-splitting flows. Rib spacing\nbased on this mechanistic model turns out to be proportional to the capillary\nlength, wherein the scaling factor can be determined based on existing models\nfor film entrainment at both low and large Capillary numbers. In addition, we\nperformed Direct Numerical Simulations, which reproduce the experimental\nphenomenology and the associated wavelength. We further include two numerical\ncases wherein either the liquid density, or the liquid surface tension are\nquadrupled while keeping all other parameters identical with experiments. The\nrib spacings of these cases are in agreement with the predictions of our model.",

In this jetted-mass-removal\naccretion scenario, the accretion is through an accretion disk that launches\njets. When the star expands due to rapid mass accretion, it engulfs the inner\nzones of the accretion disk and the jets it launches. We assume that these jets\nremove the outer layers of the envelope. We mimic this in the one-dimensional\nnumerical code by alternating mass addition and mass removal parts. We add mass\nand energy, the accretion energy, to the outer layers of the envelope, leading\nto rapid stellar expansion. When the star expands by a few tens of percent, we\nstop mass addition and start mass removal until the star returns to its initial\nradius. We also show that the density of the accretion disk is larger than the\ndensity of the outer layers of the inflated envelope, allowing the disk to\nlaunch jets inside the outer inflated envelope layers. Our results show that\nmain sequence stars can accrete mass at high rates while maintaining the deep\npotential well, as some models of eruptive systems require, e.g., some luminous\nred novae, the grazing envelope evolution, and the 1837-1856 Great Eruption of\nEta Carinae.",

The\nPhi-3 Medium fine-tuned model showed the best performance (ICD-10 Recall and\nPrecision: 72%, 72%; CPT Recall and Precision: 77%, 79%; Modifier Recall and\nPrecision: 63%, 64%). The Phi-3 Medium fine-tuned model only fabricated 1% of\nICD-10 codes and 0.6% of CPT codes generated.\n  Conclusions: Our study shows that a small model that is fine-tuned on\ndomain-specific data for specific tasks using a simple set of open-source tools\nand minimal technological and monetary requirements performs as well as the\nlarger contemporary consumer models.",

This framework provides\nintuitive definitions for quasi-classical states, their phase-space\nrepresentations, and enables the definition of a universal gate set. In this\nwidely adopted representation of quantum optics, most pure states consist of\ncoherent superpositions of photon-number states. However, this approach\nneglects the particle-number superselection rule - which prohibits coherence\nbetween states of differing photon numbers - and implicitly assumes a phase\nreference. We adopt a representation of quantum optical states that respects\nthe superselection rule and revisit key tools and results in quantum optics and\ninformation encoding within quantum optics. This approach preserves the\nintuitive aspects of the traditional quadrature representation while unifying\ninsights from quantum optics with those from symmetric spin-like and angular\nmomentum systems. More than just an alternative representation, we show that a\nsuperselection rule-compliant framework provides a unified formalism for all\nbosonic encodings, from single-photon to continuous-variable encodings.

However, the task remains challenging, particularly in\nunseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution\noutputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they\nencapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse\ncorpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize\nthese outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the\nproblems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics\nacross tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and\nshould be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity\nAttention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM\nand positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from\nthe next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot,\nour method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token\ndistribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource\nrequirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance\nin-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction\nof their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen\ndomains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary\nacross distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and\nif the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent\ngeneralization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B\nreaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine\nlanguages.",

The stability and accuracy of the EFR\nsolution strongly depend on two parameters, the filter radius $\\delta$ and the\nrelaxation parameter $\\chi$. Standard choices for these parameters are usually\nfixed in time, and related to the full order model setting, i.e., the grid size\nfor $\\delta$ and the time step for $\\chi$.

In particular, we\npropose three different classes of optimized-EFR (Opt-EFR) strategies, aiming\nto optimize one or both parameters. The new Opt-EFR strategies are tested in\nthe under-resolved simulation of a turbulent flow past a cylinder at $Re=1000$.\nThe Opt-EFR proved to be more accurate than standard approaches by up to\n99$\\%$, while maintaining a similar computational time.

In this work, we have undertaken a thorough examination of\nthe mid-infrared variability of Spitzer-selected YSOs in the Cygnus-X\nstar-forming region over the last decade, using the NEOWISE time series. This\nwork compares two groups of young stars: embedded Class I objects, and the more\nevolved flat-spectrum/Class II sources. We report on 48 candidate eruptive\nvariables within these groups, including 14 with characteristics that resemble\nthe photometric behaviour of FUors. We also include an additional 20 YSOs,\nwhich are of a less certain categorisation. We find the candidate FUors to be\nan order of magnitude more common among the younger Class I systems than more\nevolved objects. A large number of the identified short-duration eruptive YSOs\ndisplay mid-infrared colour behaviour that is redder-when-brighter, which\ncontrasts with optically bright outbursts seen in YSOs.

    "abstract": "The Lin-Kernighan-Helsguan (LKH) heuristic is a classic local search\nalgorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). LKH introduces an\n$\\alpha$-value to replace the traditional distance metric for evaluating the\nedge quality, which leads to a significant improvement. However, we observe\nthat the $\\alpha$-value does not make full use of the historical information\nduring the search, and single guiding information often makes LKH hard to\nescape from some local optima. To address the above issues, we propose a novel\nway to extract backbone information during the TSP local search process, which\nis dynamic and can be updated once a local optimal solution is found. We\nfurther propose to combine backbone information, $\\alpha$-value, and distance\nto evaluate the edge quality so as to guide the search. Moreover, we abstract\ntheir different combinations to arms in a multi-armed bandit (MAB) and use an\nMAB model to help the algorithm select an appropriate evaluation metric\ndynamically. Both the backbone information and MAB can provide diverse guiding\ninformation and learn from the search history to suggest the best metric. We\napply our methods to LKH and LKH-3, which is an extension version of LKH that\ncan be used to solve about 40 variant problems of TSP and Vehicle Routing\nProblem (VRP). Extensive experiments show the excellent performance and\ngeneralization capability of our proposed method, significantly improving LKH\nfor TSP and LKH-3 for two representative TSP and VRP variants, the Colored TSP\n(CTSP) and Capacitated VRP with Time Windows (CVRPTW).",

    "abstract": "This study advances the field of conflict forecasting by using text-based\nactor embeddings with transformer models to predict dynamic changes in violent\nconflict patterns at the actor level. More specifically, we combine newswire\ntexts with structured conflict event data and leverage recent advances in\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to forecast escalations and\nde-escalations among conflicting actors, such as governments, militias,\nseparatist movements, and terrorists. This new approach accurately and promptly\ncaptures the inherently volatile patterns of violent conflicts, which existing\nmethods have not been able to achieve. To create this framework, we began by\ncurating and annotating a vast international newswire corpus, leveraging\nhand-labeled event data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. By using this\nhybrid dataset, our models can incorporate the textual context of news sources\nalong with the precision and detail of structured event data. This combination\nenables us to make both dynamic and granular predictions about conflict\ndevelopments. We validate our approach through rigorous back-testing against\nhistorical events, demonstrating superior out-of-sample predictive power. We\nfind that our approach is quite effective in identifying and predicting phases\nof conflict escalation and de-escalation, surpassing the capabilities of\ntraditional models.

To address this challenge, we introduce\nthe estimation theory in statistical inference into the study of thermodynamics\nand statistical physics for finite-sized systems. By regarding the finite-sized\nsystem as a thermometer used to measure the temperature of the heat reservoir,\nwe show that optimal estimation of temperature yields the corresponding entropy\nformula for an isolated system.

These different definitions of entropy, rather than being\ncontradictory, apply to optimal estimation of different parameters.\nFurthermore, via the Laplace transform, we identify a complementarity between\nestimation of temperature and system's energy, a concept suggested by Niels\nBohr. We also correct the energy-temperature uncertainty relation, as expressed\nby the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound, in the large-$N$ limit.

The HL Tau\nsystem also drives a powerful bipolar wind, and we analyze its outermost\ncomponent traced by CO emission, to determine the relationship of the flow with\nthe disk and its substructures. We use ALMA observations of the ${}^{12}$CO\n(2-1) line at 1.3 mm, with 0.2 km/s and ~ 0.28\" resolution, conducted within\nthe ALMA-DOT project. The channel maps and position-velocity diagrams show a\nrich structure of concatenated bubble- and arc-shaped features, whose size and\ndistance from the source increase with velocity. The superposition of the\nfeatures generates the apparent conical shape. The tomographic reconstruction\nof the morphology and kinematics of the red-shifted lobe suggests the presence\nof distinct nested shells having higher velocity and steeper velocity gradient\nfor shells closer to the axis, rotating in the same sense of the disk. Such\nconfiguration can be justified by different classes of models. In this paper we\ncompare the derived wind parameters with the predictions of magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) disk winds. Under this hypothesis, the launch radii of the three\noutermost shells are found to be at about the position of three adjacent dust\nrings in the disk at 58, 72 and 86 au. The wind may be capable of removing\nangular momentum from the outer disk, and we derive a magnetic lever arm of\n$\\lambda \\sim 4 - 5$, higher than that commonly adopted for MHD winds from\nthese regions. Interpretations are discussed. The arrangement of the wind in\nnested shells with brighter emission rooted at the location of ring\nsubstructures could support the results of non-ideal MHD simulations according\nto which magnetic instabilities can generate the disk ring-gap system with a\nconnected layered wind, alternatively to the action of yet undetected\nprotoplanets.",

The portfolio is modeled as a structured\nensemble, where each predictor corresponds to a specific asset or hypothesis.\nStructured ensembles formally link predictors' diversity, captured via ensemble\nloss decomposition, to out-of-sample risk diversification. A structured data\nset of predictor output is constructed with a parametric diversity control,\nwhich influences both the training process and the diversification outcomes.\nThis data set is used as input for a supervised ensemble model, the target\nportfolio of which must align with the ensemble combiner rule implied by the\nloss. For squared loss, the arithmetic mean applies, yielding the\nequal-weighted portfolio as the optimal target. For asset selection, a novel\nmethod is introduced which prioritizes assets from more diverse predictor sets,\neven at the expense of lower average predicted returns, through a\ndiversity-quality trade-off. This form of diversity is applied before the\nportfolio optimization stage and is compatible with a wide range of allocation\ntechniques. Experiments conducted on the full S&P 500 universe and a data set\nof 1.300 global bonds of various types over more than two decades validate the\ntheoretical framework.

This\nabsorptions stems from a localized transition between the occupied V-$d_{xy}$\nderived band, which is odd with respect to the $a$-mirrorplane to the higher\nlying empty band formed from the same V-$d_{xy}$\n  orbitals but even with respect to that mirror-plane, which explains its\npolarization and large oscillator strength.\n  We relate this to a recent experimental study of\n  cathodoluminescence (CL) in which a suppression of the lowest CL peak was\nobserved upon addition of Li. The lowest CL peak near 1.8 eV, which lies well\nbelow the indirect absorption onset of V$_2$O$_5$ is proposed to be related to\nrecombination of a self-trapped electron polaron, resulting from oxygen\nvacancies, with a hole at the valence band maximum and is suppressed in\nLiV$_2$O$_5$ by the strong self--absorption from the Li induced occupied band\nto the higher empty bands at about the same energy.",

Dolphin first generates novel ideas based on feedback from previous\nexperiments and relevant papers ranked by the topic and task attributes.

Experiments are conducted on\nthe benchmark datasets of different topics and a subset of MLE-bench. Results\nshow that Dolphin can continuously improve the performance of the input topic\nin a loop.

Our\nexperiments demonstrate that TPD generates accurate explanations that (i)\nclarify the policy's future strategy and anticipated trajectory for a given\naction and (ii) improve understanding of the reward composition, facilitating\nfine-tuning of the reward function to align with human expectations.",

    "abstract": "Local chemical ordering strongly influences the behavior of complex\nconcentrated alloys, yet its characterization remains challenging due to the\nnanoscale dimensions and scattered spatial distribution of the ordered domains.\nHere, we study chemical ordering near grain boundaries, demonstrating they can\nact as microstructural anchor points that amplify chemical order and drive the\nformation of compositional nanopatterns. Atomistic simulations reveal the\ndevelopment of composition waves with ordering vectors normal to the boundary\nplane in two distinct material systems, CrCoNi and NbMoTaW. These waves\nmanifest as periodic enrichment-depletion patterns that reflect the underlying\nchemical ordering tendencies of each system, but with amplified contrast that\nextends several nanometers into the grain interior before gradually decaying.\nBy examining multiple grain boundary orientations and alloys, we show that both\nthe interfacial segregation profile and the crystallographic terminating plane\ngovern the extent and character of this amplification. This interplay between\nboundary-dictated directional ordering and the diffuse, untemplated chemical\ndomain evolution within the grain advances our understanding of\ninterface-mediated ordering phenomena and suggests new opportunities for\nexperimentally detecting local chemical order in complex concentrated alloys.",

However, these results assumed a perfect coronagraph coupled to a\ntelescope with an ideal coating on each of the mirrors. In this study we seek\nto understand the influence of polarization aberrations from segment-to-segment\ncoating variations on coronagraphy and polarimetry. We use the Poke open-source\npolarization ray tracing package to compute the Jones pupil of each GSMT with\nspatially-varying coatings applied to the segments. The influence of the\nresultant polarization aberrations is simulated by propagating the Jones pupil\nthrough physical optics models of coronagraphs using HCIPy. After applying\nwavefront control from an ideal adaptive optics system, we determine that the\nsegment-to-segment variations applied limit the performance of coronagraphy to\na raw contrast of approximately 10^-8 in I-band, which is 2-3 orders of\nmagnitude lower the target performance for high-contrast imaging systems on the\nground. This is a negligible addition to the nominal polarization aberrations\nfor ground-based systems.

    "abstract": "The advent of real-time large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4o has\nsparked considerable interest in efficient LMMs. LMM frameworks typically\nencode visual inputs into vision tokens (continuous representations) and\nintegrate them and textual instructions into the context of large language\nmodels (LLMs), where large-scale parameters and numerous context tokens\n(predominantly vision tokens) result in substantial computational overhead.\nPrevious efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM\nbackbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token\nquantity. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal\nvision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while\npreserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision\ntokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early\nlayers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text\ntokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to\nfuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the\nextreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token.\nLLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the\nunderstanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient\nmanner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks\ndemonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token\ninstead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by\n77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over\n10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory.",

Several previous\nstudies established an extended gamma-ray emission that is set apart from the\nradio shell of W44. This emission is thought to originate from escaped\nhigh-energy CRs that interact with a surrounding dense molecular cloud complex.\nAims. We present a detailed analysis of Fermi-LAT data with an emphasis on the\nspatial and spectral properties of W44 and its surroundings. We also report the\nresults of the observations performed with the MAGIC telescopes of the\nnorthwestern region of W44. Finally, we present an interpretation model to\nexplain the gamma-ray emission of the SNR and its surroundings. Methods. We\nfirst performed a detailed spatial analysis of 12 years of Fermi-LAT data at\nenergies above 1 GeV, in order to exploit the better angular resolution, while\nwe set a threshold of 100MeV for the spectral analysis. We performed a\nlikelihood analysis of 174 hours of MAGIC data above 130 GeV using the spatial\ninformation obtained with Fermi-LAT. Results. The combined spectra of Fermi-LAT\nand MAGIC, extending from 100MeV to several TeV, were used to derive\nconstraints on the escape of CRs. Using a time-dependent model to describe the\nparticle acceleration and escape from the SNR, we show that the maximum energy\nof the accelerated particles has to be ' 40 GeV. However, our gamma-ray data\nsuggest that a small number of lower-energy particles also needs to escape. We\npropose a novel model, the broken-shock scenario, to account for this effect\nand explain the gamma-ray emission.",

At the same\ntime, its architecture is designed so that trained models can be directly\ntranslated into interpretable policies expressed as standard (bivalent or\nprobabilistic) logic programs. Moreover, additional layers can be included to\nextract abstract features from complex observations, acting as a form of\npredicate invention. The logic representations are highly interpretable, and we\nshow how the bivalent representations of deterministic policies can be edited\nand incorporated back into a neural model, facilitating manual intervention and\nadaptation of learned policies. We evaluate our approach on a range of tasks\nrequiring learning deterministic or stochastic behaviours from various forms of\nobservations.

In particular, it is widely used to describe the properties of\nradiation fields. In fact, a useful way to distinguish between classical and\nnonclassical states of light is to ask whether their Wigner function has a\nGaussian profile or not, respectively. In this paper, we use the basis of Fock\nstates to provide the closed-form expression for the Wigner function of an\narbitrary quantum state. Thus, we provide the general expression for the Wigner\nfunction of a squeezed Fock, coherent and thermal states, with an arbitrary\nsqueezing parameter. Then, we consider the most fundamental quantum system,\nResonance Fluorescence, and obtain closed-form expressions for its Wigner\nfunction under various excitation regimes. With them, we discuss the conditions\nfor obtaining a negative-valued Wigner function and the relation it has with\npopulation inversion. Finally, we address the problem of the observation of the\nradiation field, introducing physical detectors into the description of the\nemission. Notably, we show how to expose the quantumness of a radiation field\nthat has been observed with a detector with finite spectral resolution, even if\nthe observed Wigner function is completely positive.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and its variants have made\nhuge strides toward the effective alignment of large language models (LLMs) to\nfollow instructions and reflect human values. More recently, Direct Alignment\nAlgorithms (DAAs) have emerged in which the reward modeling stage of RLHF is\nskipped by characterizing the reward directly as a function of the policy being\nlearned. Some popular examples of DAAs include Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO). These methods often suffer\nfrom likelihood displacement, a phenomenon by which the probabilities of\npreferred responses are often reduced undesirably. In this paper, we argue\nthat, for DAAs the reward (function) shape matters. We introduce\n\\textbf{AlphaPO}, a new DAA method that leverages an $\\alpha$-parameter to help\nchange the shape of the reward function beyond the standard log reward. AlphaPO\nhelps maintain fine-grained control over likelihood displacement and\nover-optimization. Compared to SimPO, one of the best performing DAAs, AlphaPO\nleads to about 7\\% to 10\\% relative improvement in alignment performance for\nthe instruct versions of Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B while achieving 15\\% to 50\\%\nrelative improvement over DPO on the same models.

When needed, an ad hoc post-processing procedure such as\nkernel smoothing is employed to smooth the individually estimated coefficients\nacross quantiles and thereby improve the performance of these estimates. This\npaper introduces a new method, called spline quantile regression (SQR), that\nunifies quantile regression with quantile smoothing and jointly estimates the\nregression coefficients across quantiles as smoothing splines. We discuss the\ncomputation of the SQR solution as a linear program (LP) using an\ninterior-point algorithm.

Our approach employs Gaussian\nsplatting for scene representation, linking each Gaussian to a learned feature\nvector that renders a feature map for any given view and timestamp.

Often, technological opportunities for process optimization or\ncustomer retention are not fully utilized. In our design case study, we\ninvestigate which technologies are already being used to improve the customer\nexperience in restaurants and explore a novel new approach to this issue. We\ndesigned, implemented, and evaluated a platform with customers and\nrestaurateurs to increase visibility and emotional connection to nearby\nrestaurants through their dishes. Some of our key findings include the enormous\npotential of combining location-based systems and conversational agents, but\nalso the difficulties in creating content for such platforms. We contribute to\nthe field of Human-Food Interaction by (1) identifying promising design spaces\nas well as customer and restaurateur requirements for technology in this\ndomain, (2) presenting an innovative design case study to improve the user\nexperience, and (3) exploring the broader implications of our design case study\nfindings for approaching a real-world metaverse.",

    "abstract": "Red blood cells (RBCs) are responsible for transporting oxygen and various\nmetabolites to tissues and organs, as well as removing waste. Several\ncardiovascular diseases can impair these functions. For instance, in diabetes,\nincreased RBC aggregation can lead to blood occlusion, thereby depriving\ntissues of efficient oxygen delivery. Interestingly, RBC adhesion occurs not\nonly in disease states but also under physiological conditions, with the key\ndifference being that adhesion is reversible in healthy situations. This paper\nfocuses on numerical simulations in 2D, exploring different adhesion energies\n(both physiological and pathological) alongside varying flow strengths and\nhematocrit levels. A systematic analysis of RBC flux and viscosity is\nconducted. A remarkable finding is that moderate adhesion energy (within the\nphysiological range) enhances RBC transport, thereby improving oxygen delivery\nto tissues. This provides insight into why RBC adhesion is present under normal\nconditions. Conversely, increasing adhesion energy beyond a certain point\ncauses a collapse in RBC flux, thus reducing oxygen transport. We provide a\nbasic explanation for the non-monotonic effect of adhesion energy on blood flow\nefficiency. This finding serves as an initial step in understanding the impact\n(both positive and negative) of RBC adhesion before addressing this issue in\ncomplex networks inspired by realistic microvasculatures.",

This\nconstitutes a rigorous proof that symmetry, in the form of invariance or\nequivariance, is a useful inductive bias.\n  We apply these ideas to equivariance and invariance in random design least\nsquares and kernel ridge regression respectively. This allows us to specify the\nreduction in expected test risk in more concrete settings and express it in\nterms of properties of the group, the model and the data.\n  Along the way, we give examples and additional results to demonstrate the\nutility of the averaging operator approach in analysing equivariant predictors.\nIn addition, we adopt an alternative perspective and formalise the common\nintuition that learning with invariant models reduces to a problem in terms of\norbit representatives.

This innovation\nallows DaS to achieve a wide range of video controls by simply manipulating the\n3D tracking videos. A further advantage of using 3D tracking videos is their\nability to effectively link frames, significantly enhancing the temporal\nconsistency of the generated videos.

However, as ICL demonstrations increase\nfrom a few to many, performance tends to plateau and eventually decline. We\nidentify two primary causes for this trend: the suboptimal negative\nlog-likelihood (NLL) optimization objective and the incremental data noise. To\naddress these issues, we introduce \\textit{DrICL}, a novel optimization method\nthat enhances model performance through \\textit{Differentiated} and\n\\textit{Reweighting} objectives. Globally, DrICL utilizes differentiated\nlearning to optimize the NLL objective, ensuring that many-shot performance\nsurpasses zero-shot levels. Locally, it dynamically adjusts the weighting of\nmany-shot demonstrations by leveraging cumulative advantages inspired by\nreinforcement learning, thereby mitigating the impact of noisy data.\nRecognizing the lack of multi-task datasets with diverse many-shot\ndistributions, we develop the \\textit{Many-Shot ICL Benchmark} (ICL-50)-a\nlarge-scale benchmark of 50 tasks that cover shot numbers from 1 to 350 within\nsequences of up to 8,000 tokens-for both fine-tuning and evaluation purposes.\nExperimental results demonstrate that LLMs enhanced with DrICL achieve\nsignificant improvements in many-shot setups across various tasks, including\nboth in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.

Using\ncross-correlation techniques, we have determined an overall planetary velocity\namplitude of $K_{\\rm p}=215.7\\pm1.1$ km/s, which is in good agreement with the\nexpected value.

While Vision-Language\nModels(VLM) excel in high-level commonsense reasoning, they lack the\nfine-grained 3D spatial understanding required for precise manipulation tasks.\nFine-tuning VLM on robotic datasets to create Vision-Language-Action\nModels(VLA) is a potential solution, but it is hindered by high data collection\ncosts and generalization issues. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel object-centric representation that bridges the gap between VLM's\nhigh-level reasoning and the low-level precision required for manipulation. Our\nkey insight is that an object's canonical space, defined by its functional\naffordances, provides a structured and semantically meaningful way to describe\ninteraction primitives, such as points and directions. These primitives act as\na bridge, translating VLM's commonsense reasoning into actionable 3D spatial\nconstraints. In this context, we introduce a dual closed-loop, open-vocabulary\nrobotic manipulation system: one loop for high-level planning through primitive\nresampling, interaction rendering and VLM checking, and another for low-level\nexecution via 6D pose tracking. This design ensures robust, real-time control\nwithout requiring VLM fine-tuning.

The prevalence and success of these\napplications have remained largely unexamined, as recent reviews on the use of\nmachine learning in archaeology have only focused only on specific subfields of\narchaeology. Our review examined an exhaustive corpus of 135 articles published\nbetween 1997 and 2022. We observed a significant increase in the number of\npublications from 2019 onwards. Automatic structure detection and artefact\nclassification were the most represented tasks in the articles reviewed,\nfollowed by taphonomy, and archaeological predictive modelling. From the\nreview, clustering and unsupervised methods were underrepresented compared to\nsupervised models. Artificial neural networks and ensemble learning account for\ntwo thirds of the total number of models used. However, if machine learning\nmodels are gaining in popularity they remain subject to misunderstanding. We\nobserved, in some cases, poorly defined requirements and caveats of the machine\nlearning methods used. Furthermore, the goals and the needs of machine learning\napplications for archaeological purposes are in some cases unclear or poorly\nexpressed. To address this, we proposed a workflow guide for archaeologists to\ndevelop coherent and consistent methodologies adapted to their research\nquestions, project scale and data. As in many other areas, machine learning is\nrapidly becoming an important tool in archaeological research and practice,\nuseful for the analyses of large and multivariate data, although not without\nlimitations.

To\ntackle these challenges, we explore multi-scale feature representations from\ndifferent perspectives, proposing a novel, lightweight, and multi-scale\narchitecture (LM-Net) that integrates advantages of both Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) to enhance segmentation\naccuracy. LM-Net employs a lightweight multi-branch module to capture\nmulti-scale features at the same level. Furthermore, we introduce two modules\nto concurrently capture local detail textures and global semantics with\nmulti-scale features at different levels: the Local Feature Transformer (LFT)\nand Global Feature Transformer (GFT). The LFT integrates local window\nself-attention to capture local detail textures, while the GFT leverages global\nself-attention to capture global contextual semantics. By combining these\nmodules, our model achieves complementarity between local and global\nrepresentations, alleviating the problem of blurred segmentation boundaries in\nmedical image segmentation. To evaluate the feasibility of LM-Net, extensive\nexperiments have been conducted on three publicly available datasets with\ndifferent modalities.

    "abstract": "The central problem in sequence reconstruction is to find the minimum number\nof distinct channel outputs required to uniquely reconstruct the transmitted\nsequence. According to Levenshtein's work in 2001, this number is determined by\nthe size of the maximum intersection between the error balls of any two\ndistinct input sequences of the channel. In this work, we study the sequence\nreconstruction problem for single-deletion single-substitution channel,\nassuming that the transmitted sequence belongs to a $q$-ary code with minimum\nHamming distance at least $2$, where $q\\geq 2$ is any fixed integer.\nSpecifically, we prove that for any two $q$-ary sequences of length $n$ and\nwith Hamming distance $d\\geq 2$, the size of the intersection of their error\nballs is upper bounded by $2qn-3q-2-\\delta_{q,2}$, where $\\delta_{i,j}$ is the\nKronecker delta. We also prove the tightness of this bound by constructing two\nsequences the intersection size of whose error balls achieves this bound.",

    "abstract": "Mrk 421 was in its most active state around early 2010, which led to the\nhighest TeV gamma-ray flux ever recorded from any active galactic nuclei. We\naim to characterize the multiwavelength behavior during this exceptional year\nfor Mrk 421, and evaluate whether it is consistent with the picture derived\nwith data from other less exceptional years. We investigated the period from\nNovember 5, 2009, (MJD 55140) until July 3, 2010, (MJD 55380) with extensive\ncoverage from very-high-energy (VHE; E$\\,>\\,$100$\\,$GeV) gamma rays to radio\nwith MAGIC, VERITAS, Fermi-LAT, RXTE, Swift, GASP-WEBT, VLBA, and a variety of\nadditional optical and radio telescopes. We investigated the variability and\ncorrelation behavior among different energy bands in great detail. We find the\nstrongest variability in X-rays and VHE gamma rays, and PSDs compatible with\npower-law functions. We observe strong correlations between X-rays and VHE\ngamma rays. We also report a marginally significant positive correlation\nbetween high-energy (HE; E$\\,>\\,$100$\\,$MeV) gamma rays and the ultraviolet\nband. We detected marginally significant correlations between the HE and VHE\ngamma rays, and between HE gamma rays and the X-ray, that disappear when the\nlarge flare in February 2010 is excluded from the correlation study. The\nactivity of Mrk 421 also yielded the first ejection of features in the VLBA\nimages of the jet of Mrk 421. Yet the large uncertainties in the ejection times\nof these radio features prevent us from firmly associating them to the specific\nflares recorded during the campaign. We also show that the collected\nmulti-instrument data are consistent with a scenario where the emission is\ndominated by two regions, a compact and extended zone, which could be\nconsidered as a simplified implementation of an energy-stratified jet as\nsuggested by recent IXPE observations.",

Extending CNNs to 3D data such as point clouds and 3D\nmeshes raises significant challenges since the very basic convolution and\npooling operators need to be completely re-visited and re-defined in an\nappropriate manner to tackle irregular connectivity issues. In this paper, we\nintroduce MeshConv3D, a 3D mesh-dedicated methodology integrating specialized\nconvolution and face collapse-based pooling operators. MeshConv3D operates\ndirectly on meshes of arbitrary topology, without any need of prior\nre-meshing/conversion techniques.

    "abstract": "The study of the topology of polynomial maps originates from classical\nquestions in affine geometry, such as the Jacobian Conjecture, as well as from\nworks of Whitney, Thom, and Mather in the 1950-70s on diffeomorphism types of\nsmooth maps. During that period, Thom came up with a famous construction of a\none-dimensional family of real polynomial maps all sharing the same degree, but\nin which every polynomial map has its unique topological type. According to his\nconvention, the topological type of a map is preserved precisely when it is\ncomposed with homeomorphisms on both source and target spaces.\n  Thom also conjectured that for each pair $(n,d)$, any family of $n$--variate,\ndegree--$d$ (complex, or real) polynomial functions has at most finitely-many\ntopological types. Soon after, a collection of results by several\nmathematicians throughout the 1970s and 1980s settled this conjecture, and\nsolved its subsequent generalization to polynomial maps.\n  In this survey, we outline the historical context and highlight a range of\nsignificant works from the 1950s to the present day that lead to the current\nstate of the art in the study of polynomial maps' topology. The focal point of\nthis survey is to shed some light on the ensuing classification problem of\ntopological types of polynomial maps. The presentation is achieved by making a\ngentle introduction to several other prominent questions in affine geometry,\nall of which are recounted through the lens of this classification problem.",

Existing approaches typically use static subsampling schemes\nin combination with sparsity-based or, more recently, deep-learning-based\nrecovery.

Using the Bayesian posterior and a deep generative\nmodel for future observations, we determine the subsampling scheme that\nmaximizes the mutual information between the subsampled observations, and the\nnext frame of the video. We evaluate our approach using the EchoNet cardiac\nultrasound video dataset and demonstrate that our active sampling method\noutperforms competitive baselines, including uniform and variable-density\nrandom sampling, as well as equidistantly spaced scan-lines, improving mean\nabsolute reconstruction error by 15%. Moreover, posterior inference and the\nsampling scheme generation are performed in just 0.015 seconds (66Hz), making\nit fast enough for real-time 2D ultrasound imaging applications.",

    "abstract": "Thanks to the vast amount of available resources and unique propagation\nproperties, terahertz (THz) frequency bands are viewed as a key enabler for\nachieving ultrahigh communication performance and precise sensing capabilities\nin future wireless systems. Recently, the European Telecommunications Standards\nInstitute (ETSI) initiated an Industry Specification Group (ISG) on THz which\naims at establishing the technical foundation for subsequent standardization of\nthis technology, which is pivotal for its successful integration into future\nnetworks. Starting from the work recently finalized within this group, this\npaper provides an industrial perspective on potential use cases and frequency\nbands of interest for THz communication systems. We first identify promising\nfrequency bands in the 100 GHz - 1 THz range, offering over 500 GHz of\navailable spectrum that can be exploited to unlock the full potential of THz\ncommunications. Then, we present key use cases and application areas for THz\ncommunications, emphasizing the role of this technology and its advantages over\nother frequency bands. We discuss their target requirements and show that some\napplications demand for multi-Tbps data rates, latency below 0.5 ms, and\nsensing accuracy down to 0.5 cm. Additionally, we identify the main deployment\nscenarios and outline other enabling technologies crucial for overcoming the\nchallenges faced by THz system. Finally, we summarize the past and ongoing\nstandardization efforts focusing on THz communications, while also providing an\noutlook towards the inclusion of this technology as an integral part of the\nfuture sixth generation (6G) and beyond communication networks.",

    "abstract": "Regularized models are often sensitive to the scales of the features in the\ndata and it has therefore become standard practice to normalize (center and\nscale) the features before fitting the model. But there are many different ways\nto normalize the features and the choice may have dramatic effects on the\nresulting model. In spite of this, there has so far been no research on this\ntopic. In this paper, we begin to bridge this knowledge gap by studying\nnormalization in the context of lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression. We\nfocus on binary features and show that their class balances (proportions of\nones) directly influences the regression coefficients and that this effect\ndepends on the combination of normalization and regularization methods used. We\ndemonstrate that this effect can be mitigated by scaling binary features with\ntheir variance in the case of the lasso and standard deviation in the case of\nridge regression, but that this comes at the cost of increased variance of the\ncoefficient estimates. For the elastic net, we show that scaling the penalty\nweights, rather than the features, can achieve the same effect. Finally, we\nalso tackle mixes of binary and normal features as well as interactions and\nprovide some initial results on how to normalize features in these cases.",

Using both analytical methods and numerical simulations, we\nexplore how the ability of persistence (measured by some principal eigenvalue)\nand how the asymptotic spreading speed depend on the parameter $q$ and on the\nphase shift between the growth rate $r(x)$ and the diffusion coefficient\n$D(x)$.\n  Our results demonstrate that persistence and spreading properties generally\ndepend on $q$: for example, appropriate configurations of $r(x)$ and $D(x)$ can\nbe constructed such that $q$-diffusion either enhances or diminishes the\nability of persistence and the spreading speed with respect to the traditional\nFickian diffusion. We show that the spatial arrangement of $r(x)$ with respect\nto $D(x)$ has markedly different effects depending on whether $q > 0$, $q = 0$,\nor $q < 0$. The case where $r$ is constant is an exception: persistence becomes\nindependent of $q$, while the spreading speed displays a symmetry around $q =\n1/2$.\n  This work underscores the importance of carefully selecting diffusion models\nin ecological and epidemiological contexts, highlighting their potential\nimplications for persistence, spreading, and control strategies.",

    "abstract": "Distributed ledger technology offers several advantages for banking and\nfinance industry, including efficient transaction processing and cross-party\ntransaction reconciliation. The key challenges for adoption of this technology\nin financial institutes are (a) the building of a privacy-preserving ledger,\n(b) supporting auditing and regulatory requirements, and (c) flexibility to\nadapt to complex use-cases with multiple digital assets and actors. This paper\nproposes a framework for a private, audit-able, and distributed ledger (PADL)\nthat adapts easily to fundamental use-cases within financial institutes. PADL\nemploys widely-used cryptography schemes combined with zero-knowledge proofs to\npropose a transaction scheme for a `table' like ledger. It enables fast\nconfidential peer-to-peer multi-asset transactions, and transaction graph\nanonymity, in a no-trust setup, but with customized privacy. We prove that\nintegrity and anonymity of PADL is secured against a strong threat model.\nFurthermore, we showcase three fundamental real-life use-cases, namely, an\nassets exchange ledger, a settlement ledger, and a bond market ledger. Based on\nthese use-cases we show that PADL supports smooth-lined inter-assets auditing\nwhile preserving privacy of the participants. For example, we show how a bank\ncan be audited for its liquidity or credit risk without violation of privacy of\nitself or any other party, or how can PADL ensures honest coupon rate payment\nin bond market without sharing investors values. Finally, our evaluation shows\nPADL's advantage in performance against previous relevant schemes.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a spatial model for dormancy in random environment\nvia a two-type branching random walk in continuous-time, where individuals can\nswitch between dormant and active states through spontaneous switching\nindependent of the random environment. However, the branching mechanism is\ngoverned by a random environment which dictates the branching rates, namely the\nsimple symmetric exclusion process. We will interpret the presence of the\nexclusion particles either as catalysts, accelerating the branching mechanism,\nor as traps, aiming to kill the individuals. The difference between active and\ndormant individuals is defined in such a way that dormant individuals are\nprotected from being trapped, but do not participate in migration or branching.\nWe quantify the influence of dormancy on the growth resp. survival of the\npopulation by identifying the large-time asymptotics of the expected population\nsize. The starting point for our mathematical considerations and proofs is the\nparabolic Anderson model via the Feynman-Kac formula. In particular, the\nquantitative investigation of the role of dormancy is done by extending the\nParabolic Anderson model to a two-type random walk.",

However, in the hard state\nshortly before transitioning into the \"obscured state\" on May 14, 2019 (MJD\n58617), the winds exhibited a discernible reduction in ionization degree ($\\log\n\\xi$), decreasing from above 4 to approximately 3. Our analysis involves the\nmeasurement of the frequencies of the quasi-periodic oscillations and the\nestimation of the properties of the ionized winds and the intensities of\ndifferent spectral components through spectroscopy during the decay phase. We\ndelve into the origin of these infrequently observed warm outflows in the hard\nstate. It is found that the launching radius of the winds in the hard decay\nphase is similar to that in the soft state, indicating the launching mechanism\nof those winds in both states is likely the same.

TOI-5108 b is a sub-Saturn with a radius of $6.6 \\pm 0.1$\n$R_\\oplus$ and a mass of $32 \\pm 5$ $M_\\oplus$. TOI-5786 b is similar to Saturn\nwith a radius of $8.54 \\pm 0.13$ $R_\\oplus$ and a mass of $73 \\pm 9$\n$M_\\oplus$. The host star for TOI-5108 b is a moderately bright (Vmag 9.75)\nG-type star. TOI-5786 is a slightly dimmer (Vmag 10.2) F-type star. Both\nplanets are close to their host stars with periods of 6.75 days and 12.78 days\nrespectively. This puts TOI-5108 b just inside the bounds of the Neptune desert\nwhile TOI-5786 b is right above the upper edge.

We estimate mass-loss rates between 1.0 * $10^9$\ng/s and 9.8 * $10^9$ g/s for TOI-5108 b and between 3.6 * $10^8$ g/s and 3.5 *\n$10^9$ g/s for TOI-5786 b.

The\ninterplay between supercurrent and Ohmic dissipation in a type-II\nsuperconductor is dictated by vortex motion and the robustness of vortex\npinning forces. In this study, we present an experimental investigation of the\nsuperconducting phase transitions and vortex dynamics in the atomically thin\ntype-II superconductor 2H-NbSe$_2$. We fabricated a high-quality multilayer\n2H-NbSe$_2$ with a step junction, demonstrating supercurrent in clean limit\nbelow a critical temperature of 6.6 K and a high residual resistance ratio of\n17. The upper critical field was estimated to be 4.5 T and the Ginzburg-Landau\ncoherence length 8.6 nm. Additionally, we observed phase transitions induced by\nvortex viscous dynamics in the 2H-NbSe$_2$ step junction. Analysis of the\npinning force density using the Dew-Hughes model indicates that the pinning\nforce in the 2H-NbSe$_2$ device can be attributed to step junction, related to\nthe surface-$\\Delta\\kappa$ type of pinning centers.

We examine two proposed mechanisms of material mixing in stars by IGWs\nthat are commonly quoted, relating to thermal diffusion and sub-wavelength\nshearing. Thermal diffusion provides a non-restorative effect to the waves,\nleaving material displaced from its previous equilibrium, while shearing\narising within the waves drives weak localised flows, mixing the fluid there.\nUsing IGW spectra from the simulations, we evaluate theoretical predictions of\nmixing rates due to these mechanisms. We show, for $20M_\\odot$ main-sequence\nstars, that neither of these mechanisms are likely to create mixing sufficient\nto correct inaccuracies in current stellar evolution models. Furthermore, we\ncompare these predictions to results obtained from Lagrangian tracer particles,\nfollowing a method recently used for global simulations of stellar interiors to\nmeasure mixing by IGWs in their radiative zones. We demonstrate that tracer\nparticle methods face significant numerical challenges in measuring the small\ndiffusion coefficients predicted by the aforementioned theories, for which they\nare prone to yielding artificially enhanced coefficients. Diffusion\ncoefficients based on such methods are currently used with stellar evolution\ncodes for asteroseismic studies, but should be viewed with caution. Finally, in\na case where tracer particles do not suffer from numerical artefacts, we\nsuggest that a diffusion model is not suitable for timescales typically\nconsidered by two-dimensional numerical simulations.",

In this paper, we propose a\nsimultaneous transmission and reflection reconfigurable intelligent surface\n(STAR-RIS) aided dynamic scatterers tracking scheme for ISAC in high mobility\nmillimeter wave communication systems, where the STAR-RIS is employed to\nprovide communication service for indoor user with the base station (BS) and\nsimultaneously sense and track the interested outdoor dynamic scatterers.\nSpecifically, we resort to an active STAR-RIS to respectively receive and\nfurther deal with the impinging signal from its double sides at the same time.\nThen, we develop a transmission strategy with the activation scheme of the\nSTAR-RIS elements, and construct the signal models within the system. After\nacquiring the channel parameters related to the BS-RIS channel, the dynamic\npaths can be identified from all the scattering paths, and the dynamic targets\ncan be classified with respect to their radar cross sections. We further track\nthe outdoor scatterers at STAR-RIS by resorting to the Gaussian\nmixture-probability hypothesis density filter. With the tracked locations of\nthe outdoor scatterers, a beam prediction strategy for both the precoder of BS\nand the refraction phase shift vector of STAR-RIS is developed to enhance the\ncommunication performance of the indoor user. Besides, a target mismatch\ndetection and path collision prediction mechanism is proposed to reduce the\ntraining overhead and improve the transmission performance. Finally, the\nfeasibility and effectiveness of our proposed STAR-RIS aided dynamic scatterers\ntracking scheme for ISAC are demonstrated and verified via simulation results.",

These\nfacts indicate that the higher the Vm and Vd, the stronger the solar cycle, the\nmore the ES-flares and the earlier they occurred.

To address these limitations, We\nintroduce KAnoCLIP, a novel ZSAD framework that leverages vision-language\nmodels.

KnPL\nuses a knowledge-driven (KD) loss function to create learnable anomaly prompts,\nremoving the need for fixed text prompts and enhancing generalization.

Fortunately, many off-the-shelf Pre-trained Code\nModels (PCMs), such as CodeBERT, CodeT5, CodeGen, and Code Llama, have been\nreleased publicly. These models acquire general code understanding and\ngeneration capability during pretraining, which enhances their performance on\ndownstream code intelligence tasks. With an increasing number of these public\npre-trained models, selecting the most suitable one to reuse for a specific\ntask is essential. In this paper, we systematically investigate the reusability\nof PCMs. We first explore three intuitive model selection methods that select\nby size, training data, or brute-force fine-tuning. Experimental results show\nthat these straightforward techniques either perform poorly or suffer high\ncosts. Motivated by these findings, we explore learning-based model selection\nstrategies that utilize pre-trained models without altering their parameters.\nSpecifically, we train proxy models to gauge the performance of pre-trained\nmodels, and measure the distribution deviation between a model's latent\nfeatures and the task's labels, using their closeness as an indicator of model\ntransferability. We conduct experiments on 100 widely-used opensource PCMs for\ncode intelligence tasks, with sizes ranging from 42.5 million to 3 billion\nparameters. The results demonstrate that learning-based selection methods\nreduce selection time to 100 seconds, compared to 2,700 hours with brute-force\nfine-tuning, with less than 6% performance degradation across related tasks.",

Third, we perform the first study of NAS for ViTs OoD robustness,\nanalyzing 9 Training-free NAS methods. We find that existing Training-free NAS\nmethods are largely ineffective in predicting OoD accuracy despite excelling at\nID accuracy. Simple proxies like Param or Flop surprisingly outperform complex\nTraining-free NAS methods in predicting OoD accuracy. Finally, we study how ViT\narchitectural attributes impact OoD generalization and discover that increasing\nembedding dimensions generally enhances performance.

    "abstract": "Differential equations are a crucial mathematical tool used in a wide range\nof applications. If the solution to an initial value problem (IVP) can be\ntransformed into an oracle, it can be utilized in various fields such as search\nand optimization, achieving quadratic speedup with respect to the number of\ncandidates compared to its classical counterpart. In the past, attempts have\nbeen made to implement such an oracle using the Euler method. In this study, we\npropose a quantum linear multistep method (QLMM) that applies the linear\nmultistep method, commonly used to numerically solve IVPs on classical\ncomputers, to generate a numerical solution of the IVP for use in a quantum\noracle. We also propose a method to find the optimal form of QLMM for a given\nIVP. Finally, through computer simulations, we derive the QLMM formulation for\nan example IVP and show that the solution from the optimized QLMM can be used\nin an optimization problem.",

    "abstract": "We propose a general deep plug-and-play (PnP) algorithm with a theoretical\nconvergence guarantee. PnP strategies have demonstrated outstanding performance\nin various image restoration tasks by exploiting the powerful priors underlying\nGaussian denoisers. However, existing PnP methods often lack theoretical\nconvergence guarantees under realistic assumptions due to their ad-hoc nature,\nresulting in inconsistent behavior. Moreover, even when convergence guarantees\nare provided, they are typically designed for specific settings or require a\nconsiderable computational cost in handling non-quadratic data-fidelity terms\nand additional constraints, which are key components in many image restoration\nscenarios. To tackle these challenges, we integrate the PnP paradigm with\nprimal-dual splitting (PDS), an efficient proximal splitting methodology for\nsolving a wide range of convex optimization problems, and develop a general\nconvergent PnP framework. Specifically, we establish theoretical conditions for\nthe convergence of the proposed PnP algorithm under a reasonable assumption.\nFurthermore, we show that the problem solved by the proposed PnP algorithm is\nnot a standard convex optimization problem but a more general monotone\ninclusion problem, where we provide a mathematical representation of the\nsolution set. Our approach efficiently handles a broad class of image\nrestoration problems with guaranteed theoretical convergence. Numerical\nexperiments on specific image restoration tasks validate the practicality and\neffectiveness of our theoretical results.",

    "abstract": "In practical sleep stage classification, a key challenge is the variability\nof EEG data across different subjects and environments. Differences in\nphysiology, age, health status, and recording conditions can lead to domain\nshifts between data. These domain shifts often result in decreased model\naccuracy and reliability, particularly when the model is applied to new data\nwith characteristics different from those it was originally trained on, which\nis a typical manifestation of negative transfer. To address this, we propose\nSelectiveFinetuning in this paper. Our method utilizes a pretrained Multi\nResolution Convolutional Neural Network (MRCNN) to extract EEG features,\ncapturing the distinctive characteristics of different sleep stages. To\nmitigate the effect of domain shifts, we introduce a domain aligning mechanism\nthat employs Earth Mover Distance (EMD) to evaluate and select source domain\ndata closely matching the target domain. By finetuning the model with selective\nsource data, our SelectiveFinetuning enhances the model's performance on target\ndomain that exhibits domain shifts compared to the data used for training.\nExperimental results show that our method outperforms existing baselines,\noffering greater robustness and adaptability in practical scenarios where data\ndistributions are often unpredictable.",

Here we review the evidence\nsupporting this empirical fact as well as its theoretical interpretation. It\nseems to be an emergent law resulting from the concentration-halo mass relation\npredicted by the current cosmological model, where the DM is made of\ncollisionless cold DM particles (CDM). We argue that the prediction rhoc X rc\nsimeq constant is not specific to this particular model of DM but holds for any\nother DM model (e.g., self-interacting) or process (e.g., stellar or AGN\nfeedback) that redistributes the DM within halos conserving its CDM mass.

However, recent observations from\nthe Juno mission suggest a possible depletion of alkali metals in Jupiter's\nmolecular hydrogen envelope, indicating that a stable radiative layer could\nexist at the kilobar level. Recent studies propose that deep stable layers help\nreconcile various Jupiter observations, including its atmospheric water and CO\nabundances and the depth of its zonal winds. However, opacity tables used to\ninfer stable layers are often outdated and incomplete, leaving the precise\nmolecular hydrogen envelope composition required for a deep radiative zone\nuncertain. In this paper, we determine atmospheric compositions that can lead\nto the formation of a radiative zone at the kilobar level in Jupiter and Saturn\ntoday. We computed radiative opacity tables covering pressures up to $10^5$\nbar, including the most abundant molecules present in the gas giants of the\nSolar System, as well as contributions from free electrons, metal hydrides,\noxides, and atomic species, using the most up-to-date line lists published in\nthe literature. These tables were used to calculate Rosseland-mean opacities\nfor the molecular hydrogen envelopes of Jupiter and Saturn, which were then\ncompared to the critical mean opacity required to maintain convection. We find\nthat the presence of a radiative zone is controlled by the existence of K, Na,\nand NaH in the atmosphere of Jupiter and Saturn. For Jupiter, the elemental\nabundance of K and Na must be less than $\\sim 10^{-3}$ times solar to form a\nradiative zone. In contrast, for Saturn, the required abundance for K and Na is\nbelow $\\sim 10^{-4}$ times solar.",

Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities\nbased on token-level alignment but overlook LLMs' inherent strength on natural\nlanguage processing -- their deep understanding of linguistic logic and\nstructure rather than superficial embedding processing. We propose\nContext-Alignment, a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in\nthe language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and\ncomprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities. Specifically, such\ncontext-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment,\nwhich is achieved by a Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to\nTS-language multimodal inputs. Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes\nto describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs treat long TS\ndata as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features.\nLogical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring\ncoherence in the contextual semantics. Demonstration examples prompt are\nemployed to construct Demonstration Examples based Context-Alignment (DECA)\nfollowing DSCA-GNNs framework. DECA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated\ninto various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and\nstructure, thereby enhancing performance.

    "abstract": "An accurate AI-based diagnostic system for induction motors (IMs) holds the\npotential to enhance proactive maintenance, mitigating unplanned downtime and\ncurbing overall maintenance costs within an industrial environment. Notably,\namong the prevalent faults in IMs, a Broken Rotor Bar (BRB) fault is frequently\nencountered. Researchers have proposed various fault diagnosis approaches using\nsignal processing (SP), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid\narchitectures for BRB faults. One limitation in the existing literature is the\ntraining of these architectures on relatively small datasets, risking\noverfitting when implementing such systems in industrial environments. This\npaper addresses this limitation by implementing large-scale data of BRB faults\nby using a transfer-learning-based lightweight DL model named ShuffleNetV2 for\ndiagnosing one, two, three, and four BRB faults using current and vibration\nsignal data. Spectral images for training and testing are generated using a\nShort-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The dataset comprises 57,500 images, with\n47,500 used for training and 10,000 for testing. Remarkably, the ShuffleNetV2\nmodel exhibited superior performance, in less computational cost as well as\naccurately classifying 98.856% of spectral images. To further enhance the\nvisualization of harmonic sidebands resulting from broken bars, Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT) is applied to current and vibration data. The paper also\nprovides insights into the training and testing times for each model,\ncontributing to a comprehensive understanding of the proposed fault diagnosis\nmethodology. The findings of our research provide valuable insights into the\nperformance and efficiency of different ML and DL models, offering a foundation\nfor the development of robust fault diagnosis systems for induction motors in\nindustrial settings.",

    "abstract": "Green hydrogen is thought to be a game changer for reaching sustainability\ntargets. However, the transition to a green hydrogen economy faces a critical\nchallenge known as the `chicken-and-egg dilemma', wherein establishing a\nhydrogen supply network relies on demand, while demand only grows with reliable\nsupply. In addition, as the hydrogen market is in the early stage, predicting\ndemand distributions is challenging due to lack of data availability. This\npaper addresses these complex issues through a risk-averse framework with the\nintroduction of a distributionally robust hydrogen network expansion planning\nproblem under decision-dependent demand ambiguity. The problem optimizes\nlocation and production capacity decisions of the suppliers considering the\nmoments of the stochastic hydrogen demand as a function of these investment\ndecisions. To obtain tractable representations of this problem, we derive two\ndifferent reformulations that consider continuous and discrete hydrogen demand\nsupport sets under different forms of decision dependencies. To efficiently\nsolve the reformulations, we develop a tailored algorithm based on the\ncolumn-and-constraint generation approach, and enhance the computational\nperformance through solving the master problems to a relative optimality gap,\ndecomposing the subproblems, and integrating pre-generated columns and\nconstraints. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we investigate a\nreal case study leveraging data from the \"Hydrogen Energy Applications in\nValley Environments for Northern Netherlands (HEAVENN)\" project. The results\nreveal that considering the chicken-and-egg dilemma under uncertain hydrogen\nmarket conditions leads to earlier and more diverse investments, providing\ncritical insights for policymakers based on the degree of decision dependency.",

Applying AFRT to encode multi-unit activity in areas\nV1, V4, and IT of the macaque brain, we demonstrate that AFRT reduces redundant\ncomputations and enhances the performance of current linearizing encoding\nmodels by segmenting each neuron's receptive field into an affine retinal\ntransform, followed by a localized feature response. Remarkably, by factorizing\nreceptive fields into a sequential affine component with three interpretable\nparameters (for shifting and scaling) and response components with a small\nnumber of feature weights per response, AFRT achieves encoding with orders of\nmagnitude fewer parameters compared to unstructured models. We show that the\nretinal transform of each neuron's encoding agrees well with the brain's\nreceptive field.

This excess\nnot only leads to bloated images that are cumbersome to transmit and store but\nalso increases the attack surface, making them more vulnerable to security\nthreats. Therefore, image slimming has emerged as a significant area of\ninterest. Nevertheless, existing image slimming technologies face challenges,\nparticularly regarding the incomplete extraction of environment dependencies\nrequired by project code. In this paper, we present a novel image slimming\nmodel named {\\delta}-SCALPEL. This model employs static data dependency\nanalysis to extract the environment dependencies of the project code and\nutilizes a data structure called the command linked list for modeling the\nimage's file system. We select 20 NPM projects and two official Docker Hub\nimages to construct a dataset for evaluating {\\delta}-SCALPEL. The evaluation\nresults show that {\\delta}-SCALPEL can reduce image sizes by up to 61.4% while\nensuring the normal operation of these projects.",

Although spin transport\nin the integrable easy-axis XXZ model is diffusive, corresponding $R$ is much\ncloser to ballistic chains than to chaotic diffusive systems. In the case of\nthe grand canonical ensemble, this observation can be rigorously justified,\nwhile in the case of the canonical ensemble it can be demonstrated by numerical\ncalculations. Integrability breaking perturbation (IBP) strongly reduces $R$\nwhich reveals a pronounced minimum at the crossover from anomalous diffusive to\nnormal dissipative transport.

Given that language impairments manifest\nearly in NCD progression, visual-stimulated narrative (VSN)-based analysis\noffers a promising avenue for NCD detection. Current VSN-based NCD detection\nmethods primarily focus on linguistic microstructures (e.g., pauses, lexical\ndiversity), which are potentially linked to bottom-up (stimulus-driven)\ncognitive processing. While these features illuminate basic language abilities,\nthe higher-order linguistic macrostructures (e.g., thematic or logical\ndevelopment), which may reflect top-down (concept-driven) cognitive abilities,\nremain underexplored. These patterns are crucial for NCD detection yet\nchallenging to quantify due to their abstract and complex nature. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose two novel dynamic macrostructural approaches: (1) Dynamic\nTopic Model (DTM) to track topic evolution over time, and (2) Text-Image\nTemporal Alignment Network (TITAN) to measure cross-modal consistency between\nspeech and visual stimuli. Experimental results validated the efficiency of\nproposed approaches in NCD detection, with TITAN achieving superior performance\nboth on the CU-MARVEL-RABBIT corpus (F1 = 0.7238) and the ADReSS corpus (F1 =\n0.8889). The feature contribution analysis revealed that macrostructural\nfeatures (e.g., topic variability, topic change rate, and topic consistency)\nconstituted the most significant contributors in the model's decision pathways,\noutperforming investigated microstructural features.

Moreover, water quantity and quality are interdependent, with the\nformer affecting the latter. However, this relationship has not been thoroughly\nstudied from the perspective of long-memory processes, which this paper aims to\naddress. We propose applying a new stochastic volatility model, a system of\ninfinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations, to describe dynamic\nasset prices in finance and economics. Although the stochastic volatility model\nwas originally developed for phenomena unrelated to the water environment, its\nmathematical universality allows for an interdisciplinary reinterpretation:\nriver discharge is analogous to volatility, and water quality to asset prices.\nMoreover, the model's infinite-dimensional nature enables the analytical\ndescription of sub-exponential memory. The moments and autocorrelations of the\nmodel are then obtained analytically. We mathematically analyze the stochastic\nvolatility model and investigate its applicability to the dynamics of water\nquantity and quality. Finally, we apply the model to real time-series data from\na river in Japan, demonstrating that it effectively captures both the memory\nand the correlation of water quality indices to river discharge.

Our method adopts pre-trained CLIP as a strong feature extractor for\ngenerating the segmentation of 3D CT scans, while adaptively aggregating the\ncross-modality of text and image representations. We propose a s pecially\ndesigned adapter module to fine-tune pre-trained CLIP with a self-adaptive\nlearning strategy to effectively fuse the two modalities of embeddings. We\nextensively validate our method on a local dataset, which is the largest\npulmonary artery-vein CT dataset to date and consists of 718 labeled data in\ntotal. The experiments show that our method outperformed other state-of-the-art\nmethods by a large margin. Our data and code will be made publicly available\nupon acceptance.",

Wavelength tunability in\nTHz polarization control is fundamentally important for the resonant excitation\nof collective modes. Here, we propose and demonstrate a simple and convenient\nTHz phase retarder based on the Mach-Zehnder interferometer to obtain circular\npolarization.

Unlike Lyman alpha, the triplet is less affected by ISM absorption.\nSufficient XUV stellar irradiation may trigger the formation of the He I\ntriplet via photoionization and posterior recombination processes in the planet\natmospheres. Only a weak trend between stellar XUV and the planetary He I\nstrength has been observed so far. Aims. We aim to confirm this mechanism for\nproducing the He I absorption in exoplanetary atmospheres by examining a sample\nof planetary systems. Methods. We obtained homogeneous measurements of the\nplanetary He I line EW and consistently computed the stellar XUV ionizing\nirradiation. We first derived new coronal models for the planet-host stars. We\nused updated data from the X-exoplanets database, archival X-ray spectra of\nM-type stars (including AU Mic and Proxima Cen), and new XMM-Newton X-ray data\nobtained for the CARMENES project. These data were complemented at longer\nwavelengths with publicly available HST, FUSE, and EUVE spectra. A total of 75\nstars are carefully analyzed to obtain a new calibration between X-ray and EUV\nemission. Results. Two distinct relationships between stellar X-ray emission\n(5-100 A) and EUV_H (100-920 A) or EUV_He (100-504 A) radiation are obtained to\nscale the emission from late-type stellar coronae.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose Motion-aware Generative frame interpolation (MoG) that\nsynergizes intermediate flow guidance with generative capacities to enhance\ninterpolation fidelity. Our key insight is to simultaneously enforce motion\nsmoothness through flow constraints while adaptively correcting flow estimation\nerrors through generative refinement.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a unified framework utilizing Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to\nmodel and assess the performance of three prominent chained BFT protocols. Our\nframework effectively captures complex adversarial behaviors, focusing on two\nkey performance metrics: chain growth and commitment rate. We implement the\noptimal attack strategies obtained from MDP analysis on an existing evaluation\nplatform for chained BFT protocols and conduct extensive experiments under\nvarious settings to validate our theoretical results. Through rigorous\ntheoretical analysis and thorough practical experiments, we provide an in-depth\nevaluation of chained BFT protocols under diverse attack scenarios, uncovering\noptimal attack strategies. Contrary to conventional belief, our findings reveal\nthat while responsiveness can enhance performance, it is not universally\nbeneficial across all scenarios. This work not only deepens our understanding\nof chained BFT protocols, but also offers valuable insights and analytical\ntools that can inform the design of more robust and efficient protocols.",

Blazars are a distinct subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN),\nknown for their fast variability, high polarization, and intense emission\nacross the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays.

This study continues an optical spectroscopic campaign aimed at\nidentifying the characteristics of BCUs to improve classification and redshift\nestimates, particularly focusing on low-synchrotron-peak sources. Methods. We\nconducted a detailed analysis of optical spectroscopic data for a sample of 21\nlow-synchrotron-peak BCUs plus one bl lac with contradictory results in the\nliterature, using the 3.58-m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG, La Palma,\nSpain). Results. Our analysis identifies 14 out of the 21 BCUs as flat-spectrum\nradio quasars (FSRQs), demonstrating the effectiveness of our selection\ncriteria. Notably, four FSRQs have redshifts exceeding 1, including 4FGL\nJ2000.0+4214 at z = 2.04. Six sources are classified as bl lacs, with one of\nthem, 4FGL J0746.5-0719, showing a featureless spectrum in this work despite\npreviously exhibiting strong lines, suggesting it may be a changing-look\nblazar. One source remains classified as a BCU due to a noisy spectrum.\nAdditionally, we observed a bl lac object, 4FGL J1054.5+2211, due to\ninconsistent redshift estimates in the literature, but we could not confirm any\nredshift due to its featureless spectrum. Our findings provide insights into\nthe classification and redshift estimation of blazar candidates, emphasizing\nthe need for continued spectroscopic monitoring.",

The study of its fine-grained complexity has\ngained momentum in the last few years, partly due to the upcoming deployment of\nlattice-based cryptosystems in practice. A main motivating question has been if\nthere is a $(2-\\varepsilon)^n$ time algorithm on lattices of rank $n$, or\nwhether it can be ruled out by SETH.\n  Previous work came tantalizingly close to a negative answer by showing a\n$2^{(1-o(1))n}$ lower bound under SETH if the underlying distance metric is\nchanged from the standard $\\ell_2$ norm to other $\\ell_p$ norms. Moreover,\nbarriers toward proving such results for $\\ell_2$ (and any even $p$) were\nestablished.\n  In this paper we show \\emph{positive results} for a natural special case of\nthe problem that has hitherto seemed just as hard, namely\n$(0,1)$-$\\mathsf{CVP}$ where the lattice vectors are restricted to be sums of\nsubsets of basis vectors (meaning that all coefficients are $0$ or $1$). All\nprevious hardness results applied to this problem, and none of the previous\nalgorithmic techniques could benefit from it. We prove the following results,\nwhich follow from new reductions from $(0,1)$-$\\mathsf{CVP}$ to weighted\nMax-SAT and minimum-weight $k$-Clique.\n  1.

Recent developments in exoplanetary research highlight the\nimportance of Love numbers in understanding their internal dynamics, formation,\nmigration history and their potential habitability.

By measuring these responses, we can\ngain insights into the internal structure, composition, and density\ndistribution of exoplanets. The rate of apsidal precession of a planetary orbit\nis directly linked to the second-order fluid Love number, thus we can gain\nvaluable insights into the mass distribution of the planet. Aims.

Biological dynamics are typically\nhighly stochastic, and therefore, analyzing a competitive system requires\naccounting for the random nature of birth and death processes (demographic\nstochasticity) as well as the variability of external conditions (environmental\nstochasticity). Recent studies have highlighted the importance of species life\nhistory, showing that differences in life history lead competing species to\nexperience different levels of demographic stochasticity. Here, we propose a\nsimple model of two-species competition with different life histories and\nderive analytical expressions for various properties (fixation probability,\nfixation time, absorption time, probability density) under a wide range of\nconditions, including migration, selection, and environmental stochasticity.\nThese properties provide insights into the long-term outcomes of competition,\nsuch as species persistence, extinction risks, and the influence of\nenvironmental variability on the evenness of the community.",

Recent studies leverage a full-parameter and two-stage training\nparadigm to teach models to first understand non-English questions and then\nreason. However, this method suffers from both substantial computational\nresource computing and catastrophic forgetting. The fundamental cause is that,\nwith the primary goal of enhancing multilingual comprehension, an excessive\nnumber of irrelevant layers and parameters are tuned during the first stage.\nGiven our findings that the representation learning of languages is merely\nconducted in lower-level layers, we propose an efficient multilingual reasoning\nalignment approach that precisely identifies and fine-tunes the layers\nresponsible for handling multilingualism. Experimental results show that our\nmethod, SLAM, only tunes 6 layers' feed-forward sub-layers including 6.5-8% of\nall parameters within 7B and 13B LLMs, achieving superior average performance\nthan all strong baselines across 10 languages.

    "abstract": "T Tauri stars and their discs are crucial for understanding stellar evolution\nand the formation of planets in low-mass systems. These stars exhibit\nsignificant variability, notably emitting intense X-ray flares due to magnetic\nreconnection events. During these events, magnetic energy is converted into\nkinetic energy of particles. Some of these particles then heat the plasma of\nthe underlying chromosphere, emitting the observed X-rays. A portion of\nparticles are thought to escape the chromosphere to interact with the\nsurrounding circumstellar environment. The question is what impact do particles\nproduced by magnetic reconnection events have on the discs of young stars.\n  The complex characteristics of protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars\nrequire an interdisciplinary strategy to enhance our understanding of these\nobjects. This thesis contribute to establish a framework combining\nobservational methodologies, chemical and dynamic models of protoplanetary\ndiscs, and the mechanics of acceleration and transport of energetic particles.\n  We indroduce the role of ionisation in disc dynamics, including its sources.\nNot only from standard sources like stellar radiation and galactic cosmic rays\nbut also from non-thermal ionisation due to magnetic reconnection events. We\nthen examine energetic particles accelerated during magnetic reconnection\nevents in T Tauri flares as an alternative source of ionisation, requiring the\nconstruction of a theoretical model based on solar flares. Then, we present a\nstudy revealing that particles from magnetic reconnection events could\nsignificantly contribute to the ionisation of the inner disc. Finally, we\npresent a complementary study accounting for temporal effects, showing that\nconsidering these particles could increase the ionisation rate as well as\nviscosity, accretion rate, volumetric heating rate, and chemical complexity of\ninner protoplanetary discs.",

As a result, giant fluctuations\nshow up in all thermodynamic quantities of the engine, such as heat exchange\nand efficiency. Moreover, we find that the particle experiences an effective\nposition dependent temperature, which gives rise to dynamics that drastically\ndeviates from that of standard Brownian motion. We develop a theoretical model\naccounting for the effects of this multiplicative noise and find excellent\nagreement with the measured dynamics.

Furthermore, most\ncommon AQA tasks, such as diving in sports, are usually divided into multiple\nsub-actions, each of which contains different durations. However, existing\nmethods focus on segmenting the video into fixed frames, which disrupts the\ntemporal continuity of sub-actions resulting in unavoidable prediction errors.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel action quality assessment\nmethod through hierarchically pose-guided multi-stage contrastive regression.\nFirstly, we introduce a multi-scale dynamic visual-skeleton encoder to capture\nfine-grained spatio-temporal visual and skeletal features. Then, a procedure\nsegmentation network is introduced to separate different sub-actions and obtain\nsegmented features. Afterwards, the segmented visual and skeletal features are\nboth fed into a multi-modal fusion module as physics structural priors, to\nguide the model in learning refined activity similarities and variances.\nFinally, a multi-stage contrastive learning regression approach is employed to\nlearn discriminative representations and output prediction results.

    "abstract": "Context. The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-Rays (STIX) onboard Solar\nOrbiter was designed to observe solar flares in the X-ray range of 4-150 keV,\nproviding spectral, temporal and spatial information. Besides 30 imaging\ndetectors, STIX has two additional detectors, the coarse flare locator (CFL)\nand the background (BKG) detector. Flares observed from Earth are classified\nusing their peak X-ray flux observed by the GOES satellites. Roughly half of\nall flares observed by STIX are located on the backside of the Sun. These\nflares lack a GOES-class classification.\n  Aims. In this paper, we describe the calibration of the BKG detector aperture\nsizes. Using the calibrated measurements of the BKG detector, we explore the\nrelationship between the peak flux for flares jointly observed by STIX and\nGOES. This allows us to estimate the GOES flare classes of backside flares\nusing STIX measurements.\n  Methods. We looked at the 500 largest flares observed by both STIX and GOES\nin the time range Feb. 21 to Apr. 23. Aperture size calibration is done by\ncomparing 4-10 keV counts of the BKG detector with the CFL measurements. In a\nsecond step, we correlate the calibrated STIX BKG peak flux with the GOES peak\nflux for individual flares.\n  Results. We calibrated the BKG detector aperture sizes of STIX. Further, we\nshowed that for the larger flares a close power law fit exists between the STIX\nBKG and GOES peak flux with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.97. This\ncorrelation provides a GOES proxy with a one sigma uncertainty of 11%. We were\nable to show that the BKG detector can reliably measure a broad range of GOES\nflare classes from roughly B5 up to at least X85 (assuming a radial distance of\n1AU), making it an interesting detector-concept for future space weather\nmissions. The largest flare observed by STIX to date is an estimated X16.5\n$\\pm$ 1.8 backside flare on the 20 Mai 2024.",

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving\nsafety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have\ngreat potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations,\nleading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work\nintroduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic\nmotion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and\nyaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the\nincorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep\nlearning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space,\nthus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and\ntrajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid\nmodel facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the\ntrustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe\nplanning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world\nArgoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark\ncomparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid $k$-Clustering is a model of clustering that generalizes two of the\nmost widely studied clustering objectives: $k$-Center and $k$-Median. In this\nmodel, given a set of $n$ points $P$, the goal is to find $k$ centers such that\nthe sum of the $r$-distances of each point to its nearest center is minimized.\nThe $r$-distance between two points $p$ and $q$ is defined as $\\max\\{d(p, q)-r,\n0\\}$ -- this represents the distance of $p$ to the boundary of the $r$-radius\nball around $q$ if $p$ is outside the ball, and $0$ otherwise. This problem was\nrecently introduced by Fomin et al. [APPROX 2024], who designed a\n$(1+\\varepsilon, 1+\\varepsilon)$-bicrtieria approximation that runs in time\n$2^{(kd/\\varepsilon)^{O(1)}} \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ for inputs in $\\mathbb{R}^d$; such\na bicriteria solution uses balls of radius $(1+\\varepsilon)r$ instead of $r$,\nand has a cost at most $1+\\varepsilon$ times the cost of an optimal solution\nusing balls of radius $r$.\n  In this paper we significantly improve upon this result by designing an\napproximation algorithm with the same bicriteria guarantee, but with running\ntime that is FPT only in $k$ and $\\varepsilon$ -- crucially, removing the\nexponential dependence on the dimension $d$. This resolves an open question\nposed in their paper. Our results extend further in several directions. First,\nour approximation scheme works in a broader class of metric spaces, including\ndoubling spaces, minor-free, and bounded treewidth metrics. Secondly, our\ntechniques yield a similar bicriteria FPT-approximation schemes for other\nvariants of Hybrid $k$-Clustering, e.g., when the objective features the sum of\n$z$-th power of the $r$-distances. Finally, we also design a coreset for Hybrid\n$k$-Clustering in doubling spaces, answering another open question from the\nwork of Fomin et al.",

    "abstract": "Current novel view synthesis tasks primarily rely on high-quality and clear\nimages. However, in foggy scenes, scattering and attenuation can significantly\ndegrade the reconstruction and rendering quality. Although NeRF-based dehazing\nreconstruction algorithms have been developed, their use of deep fully\nconnected neural networks and per-ray sampling strategies leads to high\ncomputational costs. Moreover, NeRF's implicit representation struggles to\nrecover fine details from hazy scenes. In contrast, recent advancements in 3D\nGaussian Splatting achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction by explicitly\nmodeling point clouds into 3D Gaussians. In this paper, we propose leveraging\nthe explicit Gaussian representation to explain the foggy image formation\nprocess through a physically accurate forward rendering process. We introduce\nDehazeGS, a method capable of decomposing and rendering a fog-free background\nfrom participating media using only muti-view foggy images as input. We model\nthe transmission within each Gaussian distribution to simulate the formation of\nfog. During this process, we jointly learn the atmospheric light and scattering\ncoefficient while optimizing the Gaussian representation of the hazy scene. In\nthe inference stage, we eliminate the effects of scattering and attenuation on\nthe Gaussians and directly project them onto a 2D plane to obtain a clear view.\nExperiments on both synthetic and real-world foggy datasets demonstrate that\nDehazeGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both rendering\nquality and computational efficiency. visualizations are available at\nhttps://dehazegs.github.io/",

In this study, we propose and evaluate\nvarious data augmentation (DA) techniques to improve the performance of DL\nmodels for tabular data regression tasks. We compare the performance gain of\nNeural Networks by different DA strategies ranging from a naive method of\nduplicating existing observations and adding noise to a more sophisticated DA\nstrategy that preserves the underlying statistical relationship in the data.\nOur analysis demonstrates that the advanced DA method significantly improves DL\nmodel performance across multiple datasets and regression tasks, resulting in\nan average performance increase of over 10\\% compared to baseline models\nwithout augmentation. The efficacy of these DA strategies was rigorously\nvalidated across 30 distinct datasets, with multiple iterations and evaluations\nusing three different automated deep learning (AutoDL) frameworks: AutoKeras,\nH2O, and AutoGluon. This study demonstrates that by leveraging advanced DA\ntechniques, DL models can realize their full potential in regression tasks,\nthereby contributing to broader adoption and enhanced performance in practical\napplications.",

    "abstract": "The last five years of research on distributed graph algorithms have seen\nhuge leaps of progress, both regarding algorithmic improvements and\nimpossibility results: new strong lower bounds have emerged for many central\nproblems and exponential improvements over the state of the art have been\nachieved for the runtimes of many algorithms. Nevertheless, there are still\nlarge gaps between the best known upper and lower bounds for many important\nproblems. The current lower bound techniques for deterministic algorithms are\noften tailored to obtaining a logarithmic bound and essentially cannot be used\nto prove lower bounds beyond $\\Omega(\\log n)$. In contrast, the best\ndeterministic upper bounds are often polylogarithmic, raising the fundamental\nquestion of how to resolve the gap between logarithmic lower and\npolylogarithmic upper bounds and finally obtain tight bounds. We develop a\nnovel algorithm design technique aimed at closing this gap. In essence, each\nnode finds a carefully chosen local solution in $O(\\log n)$ rounds and we\nguarantee that this solution is consistent with the other nodes' solutions\nwithout coordination. The local solutions are based on a distributed version of\nHall's theorem that may be of independent interest and motivates the title of\nthis work. We showcase our framework by improving on the state of the art for\nthe following fundamental problems: edge coloring, bipartite saturating\nmatchings and hypergraph sinkless orientation. In particular, we obtain an\nasymptotically optimal $O(\\log n)$-round algorithm for $3\\Delta/2$-edge\ncoloring in bounded degree graphs. The previously best bound for the problem\nwas $O(\\log^4 n)$ rounds, obtained by plugging in the state-of-the-art maximal\nindependent set algorithm from arXiv:2303.16043 into the $3\\Delta/2$-edge\ncoloring algorithm from arXiv:1711.05469 .",

However, the mechanisms governing\nthe interactions between plasma turbulence and energetic particles remain\nincompletely understood. Here we present comprehensive observations from the\nupstream region of a quasi-perpendicular interplanetary (IP) shock on 2004\nJanuary 22, using data from four Cluster spacecraft to investigate the\ninterplay between turbulence dynamics and energetic particle transport. Our\nobservations reveal a transition in energetic proton fluxes from exponential to\npower-law decay with increasing distance from the IP shock. This result\nprovides possible observational evidence of a shift in transport behavior from\nnormal diffusion to superdiffusion. This transition correlates with an increase\nin the time ratio from $\\tau_s/\\tau_{c}<1$ to $\\tau_s/\\tau_{c}\\gg1$, where\n$\\tau_s$ is the proton isotropization time, and $\\tau_{c}$ is the turbulence\ncorrelation time. Additionally, the frequency-wavenumber distributions of\nmagnetic energy in the power-law decay zone indicate that energetic particles\nexcite linear Alfv\\'en-like harmonic waves through gyroresonance, thereby\nmodulating the original turbulence structure.

To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes a novel interpretable violence detection system, termed the\nThree-in-One (TIO) System. The TIO system integrates knowledge graphs (KG) and\ngraph attention networks (GAT) to provide three core functionalities:\ndetection, retrieval, and explanation. Specifically, the system processes each\nvideo frame along with text descriptions generated by a large language model\n(LLM) for videos containing potential violent behavior. It employs ImageBind to\ngenerate high-dimensional embeddings for constructing a knowledge graph, uses\nGAT for reasoning, and applies lightweight time series modules to extract video\nembedding features. The final step connects a classifier and retriever for\nmulti-functional outputs. The interpretability of KG enables the system to\nverify the reasoning process behind each output. Additionally, the paper\nintroduces several lightweight methods to reduce the resource consumption of\nthe TIO system and enhance its efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on\nthe XD-Violence and UCF-Crime datasets validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed system.

In\nparticular, it takes as input two high-speed camera snapshots before impact and\nproduces as output six scalars that describe the dynamics of the gas pocket.\nThe experiments are performed in a wave flume, where we use solitons -- in\ncombination with a bathymetry profile -- to generate wave breaking close to a\nsolid wall which is instrumented with dynamic pressure sensors. By varying the\nwater depth $h_\\ell$ and the parameter $\\alpha = A/h_\\ell$, where $A$ is the\nsoliton wave amplitude, we are able to generate a family of unique breaking\nwaves with different gas pocket sizes and wave kinematics.

This study employs a methodological approach, comprising web scraping\nand data mining from LeetCode, with the objective of comparing the software\nquality of Python programs produced by LeetCode users with that generated by\nGPT-4o. In order to gain insight into these matters, this study addresses the\nquestion whether GPT-4o produces software of superior quality to that produced\nby humans.\n  The findings indicate that GPT-4o does not present a considerable impediment\nto code quality, understandability, or runtime when generating code on a\nlimited scale. Indeed, the generated code even exhibits significantly lower\nvalues across all three metrics in comparison to the user-written code.\nHowever, no significantly superior values were observed for the generated code\nin terms of memory usage in comparison to the user code, which contravened the\nexpectations. Furthermore, it will be demonstrated that GPT-4o encountered\nchallenges in generalising to problems that were not included in the training\ndata set.\n  This contribution presents a first large-scale study comparing generated code\nwith human-written code based on LeetCode platform based on multiple measures\nincluding code quality, code understandability, time behaviour and resource\nutilisation.

To estimate the effect of model uncertainties, we consider five nuclear\nmass models that accurately describe known masses. We also use a\nbackward-forward Monte Carlo method to estimate uncorrelated uncertainties from\nlocal variations in model parameters, constraining them to experimentally known\nmasses before propagating them to unknown masses of neutron-rich nuclei.\n  These mass uncertainties are then applied to a 1.38-1.38 M$_{\\odot}$ neutron\nstar merger model, considering a wide range of ejecta trajectories. We find\nthat uncorrelated parameter uncertainties lead to ejected abundance\nuncertainties of 20% up to A $\\simeq$ 130, 40% between A=150 and 200, with\npeaks around A $\\simeq$ 140 and A $\\simeq$ 203, leading to deviations of\n100-300%.

The current cutting-edge\nediting methods usually obey an \"inversion-then-editing\" pipeline, where the\ninput image is inverted to an approximate Gaussian noise ${z}_T$, based on\nwhich a sampling process is conducted using the target prompt. Nevertheless, we\nargue that it is not a good choice to use a near-Gaussian noise as a pivot for\nfurther editing since it would bring plentiful fidelity errors.

Based on this, we propose a novel zero-shot editing paradigm dubbed\nZZEdit, which first locates a qualified intermediate-inverted latent marked as\n${z}_p$ as a better editing pivot, which is sufficient-for-editing while\nstructure-preserving. Then, a ZigZag process is designed to execute denoising\nand inversion alternately, which progressively inject target guidance to\n${z}_p$ while preserving the structure information of $p$ step. Afterwards, to\nachieve the same step number of inversion and denoising, we execute a pure\nsampling process under the target prompt.

To address these challenges caused\nby heterogeneous image quality, we propose a hybrid CNN-Transformer\nmodel,called CFFormer, which leverages effective channel feature extraction to\nenhance the model' s ability to accurately identify tissue regions by capturing\nrich contextual information. The proposed architecture contains two key\ncomponents: the Cross Feature Channel Attention (CFCA) module and the X-Spatial\nFeature Fusion (XFF) module. The model incorporates dual encoders, with the CNN\nencoder focusing on capturing local features and the Transformer encoder\nmodeling global features. The CFCA module filters and facilitates interactions\nbetween the channel features from the two encoders, while the XFF module\neffectively reduces the significant semantic information differences in spatial\nfeatures, enabling a smooth and cohesive spatial feature fusion.

    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates real-time short-term traffic flow prediction through\ndistributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS) and data assimilation with a stochastic\ncell-automata-based traffic model. Traffic congestion on expressways is a\nsevere issue. To alleviate its negative impacts, it is necessary to optimize\ntraffic flow prior to becoming serious congestion. For this purpose, real-time\nshort-term traffic flow prediction is promising. However, conventional traffic\nmonitoring apparatus used in prediction methods faces a technical issue due to\nthe sparsity in traffic flow data. To overcome the issue for realizing\nreal-time traffic prediction, this paper employs DFOS, which enables to obtain\nspatially continuous and real-time traffic flow data along the road without\ndead zones. Using mean velocities derived from DFOS data as a feature\nextraction, this paper proposes a real-time data assimilation method for the\nshort-term prediction. As the theoretical model, the stochastic\nNishinari-Fukui-Schadschneider model is adopted. Future traffic flow is\nsimulated with the optimal values of model parameters estimated from observed\nmean velocities and the initial condition estimated as the latest microscopic\ntraffic state. This concept is validated using two congestion scenarios\nobtained in Japanese expressways. The results show that the mean absolute error\nof the predicted mean velocities is 10-15 km/h in the prediction horizon of 30\nminutes. Furthermore, the prediction error in congestion length and travel time\ndecreases by 40-84% depending on congestion scenarios when compared with\nconventional methods with traffic counters. This paper concludes that real-time\ndata assimilation using DFOS enables an accurate short-term traffic prediction.",

It first constructs a tree\nfor one mode, then computes a TWD for the other mode based on that tree, and\nfinally uses the resulting TWD to build the second mode's tree. By repeatedly\nalternating through these steps, the method gradually refines both trees and\nthe corresponding TWDs, capturing meaningful hierarchical representations of\nthe data. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that our method converges.\nWe show that our method can be integrated into hyperbolic graph convolutional\nnetworks as a pre-processing technique, improving performance in link\nprediction and node classification tasks.

To\nhandle the substantial increase in the quantity of seismic phase picks from\nimproved picking methods and larger deployments, several novel phase\nassociators have recently been proposed. This study presents a detailed\nbenchmark analysis of five seismic phase associators, including classical and\nmachine learning-based approaches: PhaseLink, REAL, GaMMA, GENIE, and PyOcto.\nWe use synthetic datasets mimicking real seismicity characteristics in crustal\nand subduction zone scenarios.

The results reveal notable\ndifferences in precision, recall, and computational efficiency. GENIE and\nPyOcto demonstrate robust performance, with almost perfect performance for most\nscenarios. Only for the most challenging conditions with high noise levels and\nevent rates, performance drops but still maintains F1 scores above 0.8.\nPhaseLink's performance declines with noise and event density, particularly in\nsubduction zones, dropping to near zero in the most complex cases. GaMMA\noutperforms PhaseLink but struggles with accuracy and scalability in\nhigh-noise, high-density scenarios. REAL performs reasonably but loses recall\nunder extreme conditions. PyOcto and PhaseLink show the quickest runtimes for\nsmaller-scale datasets, while REAL and GENIE are more than an order of\nmagnitude slower for these cases.

In typical scenarios, Speaker Diarization (SD) is employed to\naddress the problem of 'who spoke when,' while Target Speaker Extraction (TSE)\nor Target Speaker Automatic Speech Recognition (TSASR) techniques are utilized\nto resolve the issue of 'who spoke what.' Although some works have achieved\npromising results by combining SD and TSE systems, inconsistencies remain\nbetween SD and TSE regarding both output inconsistency and scenario mismatch.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a Universal Speaker Embedding Free\nTarget Speaker Extraction and Personal Voice Activity Detection (USEF-TP) model\nthat jointly performs TSE and Personal Voice Activity Detection (PVAD). USEF-TP\nleverages frame-level features obtained through a cross-attention mechanism as\nspeaker-related features instead of using speaker embeddings as in traditional\napproaches. Additionally, a multi-task learning algorithm with a scenario-aware\ndifferentiated loss function is applied to ensure robust performance across\nvarious levels of speaker overlap. The experimental results show that our\nproposed USEF-TP model achieves superior performance in TSE and PVAD tasks on\nthe LibriMix and SparseLibriMix datasets.

In this work, we investigate a one-dimensional\nBose-Hubbard chain with a quasiperiodic potential modulating photon-photon\ninteractions, effectively creating a mosaic lattice.

Additionally, we analyze the dynamics of two\nemitters coupled to the waveguide, enabling the emission of supercorrelated\nphoton pairs into the waveguide. Our findings reveal that coupling to extended\nstates results in Markovian dynamics, characterized by exponentially\nsupercorrelated decay, while coupling to localized states gives rise to\nnon-Markovian dynamics, marked by suppressed decay and persistent oscillations.\nHere, a transition from Markovian to non-Markovian behavior occurs around the\nMEs of the doublons.

The RSVP-BCI systems\neffectively detect single-class targets within a stream of images but have\nlimited applicability in scenarios that require detecting multiple target\ncategories. Multi-class RSVP-BCI systems address this limitation by\nsimultaneously identifying the presence of a target and distinguishing its\ncategory. However, existing multi-class RSVP decoding algorithms predominantly\nrely on single-modality EEG decoding, which restricts their performance\nimprovement due to the high similarity between ERPs evoked by different target\ncategories. In this work, we introduce eye movement (EM) modality into\nmulti-class RSVP decoding and explore EEG and EM fusion to enhance decoding\nperformance. First, we design three independent multi-class target RSVP tasks\nand build an open-source dataset comprising EEG and EM signals from 43\nsubjects. Then, we propose the Multi-class Target RSVP EEG and EM fusion\nNetwork (MTREE-Net) to enhance multi-class RSVP decoding. Specifically, a\ndual-complementary module is proposed to strengthen the differentiation of\nuni-modal features across categories. To improve multi-modal fusion\nperformance, we adopt a dynamic reweighting fusion strategy guided by\ntheoretically derived modality contribution ratios. Furthermore, we reduce the\nmisclassification of non-target samples through knowledge transfer between two\nhierarchical classifiers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the feasibility of\nintegrating EM signals into multi-class RSVP decoding and highlight the\nsuperior performance of MTREE-Net compared to existing RSVP decoding methods.\nThe proposed MTREE-Net and open-source dataset provide a promising framework\nfor developing practical multi-class RSVP-BCI systems.",

Here, we show that the mechanical susceptibility can be enhanced\nsignificantly by driving the QOM system with a strong external optical field,\nand divergence will happen as the driving strength approaches the critical\npoint (CP) for spontaneous symmetry breaking. Based on the CP, we propose a\nhighly sensitive temperature sensor with a mechanical resonator quadratically\ncoupled to an optical mode. We find that the sensitivity of the temperature\nsensor can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude as the driving strength\napproaches the CP, and the sensitivity of the temperature sensor remains high\nin the low-temperature limit.

This paper proposes an\naccelerationactuated simultaneous obstacle avoidance and trajectory tracking\nmethod for arbitrarily large teams of robots, that provides a nonconservative\ncollision avoidance strategy and gives approaches for deadlock avoidance.

Furthermore, unlike the traditional methods that they address\nconflicts after a deadlock occurs, our decision-making mechanism avoids the\nnear-zero velocity, which is much more safer and efficient in crowed\nenvironments.

However, current methods for decoding repetition codes under\ncircuit level noise are suboptimal, leading to inaccurate error correction\nthresholds and introducing additional errors in event detection. In this work,\nwe establish that repetition code under circuit level noise has an exact\nsolution, and we propose an optimal maximum likelihood decoding algorithm\ncalled planar.

Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our\nalgorithm uncovers the exact threshold for depolarizing noise and realistic\nsuperconductor SI1000 noise. Furthermore, we apply our method to analyze data\nfrom recent quantum memory experiments conducted by Google Quantum AI,\nrevealing that part of the error floor was attributed to the decoding algorithm\nused by Google. Finally, we implemented the repetition code quantum memory on\nsuperconducting systems with a 72-qubit quantum chip lacking reset gates,\ndemonstrating that even with an unknown error model, the proposed algorithm\nachieves a significantly lower logical error rate than the matching-based\nalgorithm.",

However, the\nprevailing class-imbalance problem in MoS caused by the substantial variations\nin organ size exacerbates the learning difficulty of the SSL network. To\naddress this issue, in this paper, we propose an innovative semi-supervised\nnetwork with BAlanced Subclass regularIzation and semantic-Conflict penalty\nmechanism (BASIC) to effectively learn the unbiased knowledge for\nsemi-supervised MoS. Concretely, we construct a novel auxiliary subclass\nsegmentation (SCS) task based on priorly generated balanced subclasses, thus\ndeeply excavating the unbiased information for the main MoS task with the\nfashion of multi-task learning. Additionally, based on a mean teacher\nframework, we elaborately design a balanced subclass regularization to utilize\nthe teacher predictions of SCS task to supervise the student predictions of MoS\ntask, thus effectively transferring unbiased knowledge to the MoS subnetwork\nand alleviating the influence of the class-imbalance problem. Considering the\nsimilar semantic information inside the subclasses and their corresponding\noriginal classes (i.e., parent classes), we devise a semantic-conflict penalty\nmechanism to give heavier punishments to the conflicting SCS predictions with\nwrong parent classes and provide a more accurate constraint to the MoS\npredictions. Extensive experiments conducted on two publicly available\ndatasets, i.e., the WORD dataset and the MICCAI FLARE 2022 dataset, have\nverified the superior performance of our proposed BASIC compared to other\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

By integrating\nsemantic information from two-dimensional scenes with three-dimensional point\nclouds, researchers aim to improve the precision and efficiency of various\ntasks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the diverse applications\nand recent advancements in the integration of semantic information within point\nclouds.

This study investigates how LLMs, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4 and\nMicrosoft Copilot, can reinforce gender and racial stereotypes within the\nsoftware engineering (SE) profession through both textual and graphical\noutputs. We used each LLM to generate 300 profiles, consisting of 100\ngender-based and 50 gender-neutral profiles, for a recruitment scenario in SE\nroles. Recommendations were generated for each profile and evaluated against\nthe job requirements for four distinct SE positions. Each LLM was asked to\nselect the top 5 candidates and subsequently the best candidate for each role.\nEach LLM was also asked to generate images for the top 5 candidates, providing\na dataset for analysing potential biases in both text-based selections and\nvisual representations. Our analysis reveals that both models preferred male\nand Caucasian profiles, particularly for senior roles, and favoured images\nfeaturing traits such as lighter skin tones, slimmer body types, and younger\nappearances. These findings highlight underlying societal biases influence the\noutputs of LLMs, contributing to narrow, exclusionary stereotypes that can\nfurther limit diversity and perpetuate inequities in the SE field.

Going beyond the regime of validity of Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation (GPE), we study the composite vortices in miscible strongly\ninteracting binary superfluids by employing a holographic model that naturally\nincorporate finite temperature and dissipation. The composite vortices is\nclassified in terms of an integer pair $(S_1, S_2)$ of phase winding numbers\nand can share the same vortex core, while either co-rotating or\ncounter-rotating, leading to very diverse vortex structures. We uncover\ndifferent dynamical behaviors compared to results from GPE that is valid in\nweak coupling limit and zero temperature. In particular, we show that the\noccurrence of dynamic instabilities and the instability strength are sensitive\nto the temperature. We identify several temperature dependent dynamical\ntransitions in $(1,1)$, $(2,\\pm 1)$ and $(2,2)$ vortices. The splitting\nbehaviors associated with different multipolarities are demonstrated by solving\nthe full-time evolution for slightly perturbed composite vortices. We find that\nthe final states of all composite vortices are generally singly quantized\nvortices, and no additional long living vortex is formed due to strong\ndissipation.

These energetic electron distributions are crucial in\ndriving instabilities which can lead to distinct electromagnetic emissions.\nThis study investigates the emission properties of crescent-shaped electron\nvelocity distribution functions (EVDFs) under different frequency ratios\n($\\omega_{pe}/\\Omega_{ce}$), critical for understanding plasma conditions in\nvarious astrophysical environments, by comparing the emissions and intensities\nof waves among different cases. Here, we study and analyze three distinct\nfrequency ratio conditions (2.2, 10, and 1, designated as cases A, B, and C,\nrespectively). We found that the beam-Langmuir (BL) and upper-hybrid (UH) modes\ncan be efficiently excited, leading to further plasma emissions in different\ncases. Our study reveals that the fundamental (O/F) emission can reach a\nmaximum value of $\\sim$$10^{-4} E_{\\mathrm{k}0}$, while the harmonics (H) can\nextend to $\\sim$$1.5 \\times 10^{-5} E_{\\mathrm{k}0}$ depending on the frequency\nratio of the environment. The intensity of the fundamental mode exceeds\nprevious findings for pure-ring, beam, and ring-beam distributions,\nhighlighting the impact of crescent-shaped electron velocity distributions on\nwave excitation and emission processes. This effect is notably influenced by\ndifferent frequency ratios, offering new insights into the way that nonthermal\nelectron distributions affect the plasma emission process.",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of high-order ($p/q$) synchronization, induced by \\textit{two\ndifferent} frequencies in the system, is well-known and studied extensively in\nforced oscillators including neurons and to a lesser extent in coupled\noscillators. Their frequencies are locked such that for every $p$ cycles of one\noscillator there are $q$ cycles of the other. We demonstrate this phenomenon in\na pair of coupled neurons having \\textit{identical} frequencies but\n\\textit{asymmetric} coupling. Specifically, we focus on an\nexcitatory(E)-inhibitory(I) neuron pair where such an asymmetry is naturally\npresent even with equal reciprocal synaptic strengths $(g)$ and inverse time\nconstant $(\\alpha)$. We thoroughly investigate the asymmetric coupling-induced\n$p/q$ frequency locking structure in $(g,\\alpha)$ parameter space through\nsimulations and analysis. Simulations display quasiperiodicity, devil\nstaircase, a novel Farey arrangement of spike sequences, and presence of\nreducible and irreducible $p/q$ regions. We introduce an analytical method,\nbased on event-driven maps, to determine the existence and stability of any\nspike sequence of the two neurons in a $p/q$ frequency-locked state.\nSpecifically, this method successfully deals with non-smooth bifurcations and\nwe could utilize it to obtain solutions for the case of identical E-I neuron\npair under arbitrary coupling strength. In contrast to the so-called Arnold\ntongues, the $p/q$ regions obtained here are not structure-less. Instead they\nhave their own internal bifurcation structure with varying levels of\ncomplexity. Intra-sequence and inter-sequence multistability, involving spike\nsequences of same $p/q$ state, are found. Additionally, multistability also\narises by overlap of $p/q$ with $p'/q'$. The boundaries of both reducible and\nirreducible $p/q$ regions are defined by saddle node and non-smooth grazing\nbifurcations of various types.",

Controlling\nsuch frustrations using orbital and phonon engineering via the\nKugel-Khomskii-type (KK-type) interactions has recently enabled the orbital\nenhancement of magnetoelectric (ME) coupling. Using combined spectroscopic\ntechniques and first-principle simulations, here we demonstrate that the\nmagnetically frustrated Cairo lattice, Bi2Fe4O9, exhibits a strong KK-type\ninteraction resulting in a coupled spin-orbital phase below 1.8 times the Neel\ntemperature (TN = 245 K).

Instead, the observed change is reminiscent of orbitally active\nmaterials, which we explicitly confirm by measuring the T-dependence of\nlow-energy orbital excitations. We further find that Bi2Fe4O9 harbors an\nunstable polar mode, driving the lattice to a symmetry-lowered ferroelectric\n(FE) phase below TN, in line with the previously reported hysteresis in\npolarization. Nonetheless, the FE phase leads to extremely small calculated\nsuperlattice Bragg peak intensities that are yet to be experimentally\nconfirmed. Moreover, thermal conductivity measurements do not show any\nmeasurable effect of KK-type interactions on thermal transport across TN. But,\nwe observe a repeatable anomaly near 57 K appearing only in the heating cycle,\nwhich co-occurs with the 400 meV broad continuum observed in Raman\nmeasurements.

It is found\nthat in general, the deflection angle can always be separated into two parts,\nthe usual gravitational part as for neutral particles, and the electromagnetic\npart due to the interaction between the (electro)magnetic field and the signal.\nThe leading order of the gravitational, electrostatic (from nonzero spacetime\ncharge) and magnetic (from nonzero magnetic dipole moment) contributions are\n$b^{-1},\\,b^{-1}$ and $b^{-2}$ respectively. The entire electromagnetic part is\nenhanced by the large specific charge of elementary particles but suppressed by\nthe reciprocal Lorentz factor.

    "abstract": "Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have exhibited remarkable performance in\ngenerating high-quality images from text descriptions. However, these models\nare vulnerable to misuse, particularly generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW)\ncontent, such as sexually explicit, violent, political, and disturbing images,\nraising serious ethical concerns. In this work, we present PromptGuard, a novel\ncontent moderation technique that draws inspiration from the system prompt\nmechanism in large language models (LLMs) for safety alignment. Unlike LLMs,\nT2I models lack a direct interface for enforcing behavioral guidelines. Our key\nidea is to optimize a safety soft prompt that functions as an implicit system\nprompt within the T2I model's textual embedding space. This universal soft\nprompt (P*) directly moderates NSFW inputs, enabling safe yet realistic image\ngeneration without altering the inference efficiency or requiring proxy models.\nWe further enhance its reliability and helpfulness through a divide-and-conquer\nstrategy, which optimizes category-specific soft prompts and combines them into\nholistic safety guidance. Extensive experiments across five datasets\ndemonstrate that PromptGuard effectively mitigates NSFW content generation\nwhile preserving high-quality benign outputs. PromptGuard achieves 3.8 times\nfaster than prior content moderation methods, surpassing eight state-of-the-art\ndefenses with an optimal unsafe ratio down to 5.84%.",

    "abstract": "Numerical and experimental studies have demonstrated the drag-reducing\npotential of carefully designed streamwise-elongated riblets in lowering\nskin-friction drag. To support the systematic design of such surface\ncorrugations, recent efforts have integrated simplified versions of the\ngoverning equations with innovative methods for representing the effects of\nrough boundaries on flow dynamics. Notably, the statistical response of the\neddy-viscosity-enhanced linearized Navier-Stokes equations has been shown to\neffectively capture the ability of riblets in suppressing turbulence, quantify\nthe influence of background turbulence on the mean velocity, and reproduce\nestablished drag-reduction trends. In this paper, we enhance the flexibility\nand computational efficiency of this simulation-free approach by implementing a\ndomain transformation for surface representation, along with a perturbation\nanalysis on a small geometric parameter of the riblets. While domain\ntransformation complicates the differential equations, it provides accurate\nboundary representations and facilitates the analysis of complex riblet shapes\nat high Reynolds numbers by enabling perturbation analysis to simplify the\ndimensional complexity of the governing equations. Our method successfully\npredicts drag reduction trends for triangular and scalloped riblets, consistent\nwith existing literature. We further utilize our framework to investigate flow\nmechanisms influenced by riblets and extend our study to channel flows with\nfriction Reynolds numbers up to 2003. Our findings reveal the emergence of K-H\nrollers over large and sharp scalloped riblets, contributing to the degradation\nof drag reduction in these geometries. Additionally, we examine the impact of\nriblets on near-wall flow structures, focusing on their suppression of\nstreamwise-elongated structures in flows over large riblets.",

This burden is particularly high in low and middle\nincome countries. Microscopy remains essential for diagnosing TB by enabling\ndirect visualization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum smear samples,\noffering a cost effective approach for early detection and effective treatment.\nGiven the labour-intensive nature of microscopy, automating the detection of\nbacilli in microscopic images is crucial to improve both the expediency and\nreliability of TB diagnosis.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the rheological behavior of shear-thickening\nsuspensions made of different types of nanoparticles upon the addition of large\nintruders referred to as granules. The size ratio ranges from 20 to 120. We\nexamine the effects of granule size, volume fraction, and surface properties on\nshear-thickening characteristics. Starting with a fumed silica suspension\nexhibiting discontinuous shear thickening (DST) without granules, the addition\nof granules at different volume fractions, shifts the onset of thickening to\nlower shear rates. Concomitantly, the strength of the thickening, quantified by\nthe thickening index, decreases, transitioning from DST to continuous shear\nthickening (CST). Comparison with suspensions of nanosilica spheres reveals a\nsimilar trend, suggesting generality across different systems. However, these\nresults contrast with cornstarch-based suspensions, where granule addition\nenhances thickening. This difference is attributed to the large size ratio\nstudied here: When the granules are much larger than the particles in the\ninterstitial suspension, the granules introduce a spread in the local shear\nrate and disrupt the particles' ability to form an extended fabric of force\nchains. The findings highlight the critical role of particle size ratio in\ndetermining the rheology of complex suspensions, paving the way for tailoring\nmaterial properties in industrial and scientific applications.",

    "abstract": "Solar neutrino flux constraints from the legacy GALLEX/GNO and SAGE\nexperiments continue to influence contemporary global analyses of neutrino\nproperties. The constraints depend on the neutrino absorption cross sections\nfor various solar sources. Following recent work updating the $^{51}$Cr and\n$^{37}$Ar neutrino source cross sections, we reevaluate the $^{71}$Ga solar\nneutrino cross sections, focusing on contributions from transitions to\n$^{71}$Ge excited states, but also revising the ground-state transition to take\ninto account new $^{71}$Ge electron-capture lifetime measurements and various\ntheory corrections. The excited-state contributions have been traditionally\ntaken from forward-angle $(p,n)$ cross sections. Here we correct this procedure\nfor the $\\approx 10\\%-20\\%$ tensor operator contribution that alters the\nrelationship between Gamow-Teller and $(p,n)$ transition strengths. Using\nstate-of-the-art nuclear shell-model calculations to evaluate this correction,\nwe find that it lowers the $^8$B and hep neutrino cross sections. However, the\naddition of other corrections, including contributions from near-threshold\ncontinuum states that radiatively decay, leads to an overall increase in the\n$^8$B and hep cross sections of $\\approx 10\\%$ relative to the values\nrecommended by Bahcall.

Synthesis of missing MRI has been a\nmeans to address the limitations of modality insufficiency in clinical practice\nand research. However, there are still some challenges, such as poor\ngeneralization, inaccurate non-linear mapping, and slow processing speeds. To\naddress the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel unified synthesis model,\nthe Frequency-guided and Coarse-to-fine Unified Diffusion Model (FgC2F-UDiff),\ndesigned for multiple inputs and outputs. Specifically, the Coarse-to-fine\nUnified Network (CUN) fully exploits the iterative denoising properties of\ndiffusion models, from global to detail, by dividing the denoising process into\ntwo stages, coarse and fine, to enhance the fidelity of synthesized images.\nSecondly, the Frequency-guided Collaborative Strategy (FCS) harnesses\nappropriate frequency information as prior knowledge to guide the learning of a\nunified, highly non-linear mapping. Thirdly, the Specific-acceleration Hybrid\nMechanism (SHM) integrates specific mechanisms to accelerate the diffusion\nmodel and enhance the feasibility of many-to-many synthesis.

Quantum computers are\nconsidered to have the potential to solve large combinatorial optimization\nproblems faster than classical computers. Variational quantum algorithms, such\nas Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), have been studied extensively because\nthey are expected to work on noisy intermediate scale devices. Unfortunately,\nmany optimization problems have constraints, which induces infeasible solutions\nduring VQE process. Recently, several methods for efficiently solving\nconstrained combinatorial optimization problems have been proposed by designing\na quantum circuit so as to output only the states that satisfy the constraints.\nHowever, the types of available constraints are still limited. Therefore, we\nhave started to develop variational quantum circuits that can handle a wider\nrange of constraints. The proposed method utilizes a forwarding operation that\nmaps from feasible states for subproblems to those for larger subproblems. As\nlong as appropriate forwarding operations can be defined, iteration of this\nprocess can inductively construct variational circuits outputting feasible\nstates even in the case of multiple and complex constraints. In this paper, the\nproposed method was applied to facility location problem and was found to\nincrease the probability for measuring feasible solutions or optimal solutions.\nIn addition, the cost of the obtained circuit was comparable to that of\nconventional variational circuits.",

Prior works on Learning from Corrections (LfC) have\nrelied on three key assumptions to interpret human feedback: (1) people correct\nthe robot only when there is significant task objective divergence; (2) people\ncan accurately predict if a correction is necessary; and (3) people trade off\nprecision and physical effort when giving corrections. In this work, we study\nhow two key factors (robot competency and motion legibility) affect how people\nprovide correction feedback and their implications on these existing\nassumptions. We conduct a user study ($N=60$) under an LfC setting where\nparticipants supervise and correct a robot performing pick-and-place tasks. We\nfind that people are more sensitive to suboptimal behavior by a highly\ncompetent robot compared to an incompetent robot when the motions are legible\n($p=0.0015$) and predictable ($p=0.0055$). In addition, people also tend to\nwithhold necessary corrections ($p < 0.0001$) when supervising an incompetent\nrobot and are more prone to offering unnecessary ones ($p = 0.0171$) when\nsupervising a highly competent robot. We also find that physical effort\npositively correlates with correction precision, providing empirical evidence\nto support this common assumption. We also find that this correlation is\nsignificantly weaker for an incompetent robot with legible motions than an\nincompetent robot with predictable motions ($p = 0.0075$). Our findings offer\ninsights for accounting for competency and legibility when designing robot\ninteraction behaviors and learning task objectives from corrections.",

The actual origin arises from the numerical (technical)\nmethod deployed to reduce computation time. In addition, there is a gap between\nthe theoretical equation for Fourier analysis and its numerical implementation.\nKnowing the facts brings us practical benefits. In this case, these related to\nboundary conditions, and complex integrals. For example, replacing a Fourier\nintegral with a complex integral brings a hybrid method for the Laplace and\nFourier transforms, and reveals another perspective on time-frequency analysis.\nWe present such a perspective here with a simple demonstrative analysis.",

We identify\nspatial variation of zero-point offsets, up to 30--40\\,mmag for blue filters\n($u$, $J0378$, $J0395$) and 10\\,mmag for others, predominantly due to the\nhigher uncertainties of the technique employed in the original USS calibration.\nMoreover, we detect large- and medium-scale CCD position-dependent systematic\nerrors, up to 50\\,mmag, primarily caused by different aperture and flat-field\ncorrections. We then re-calibrate the USS DR1 photometry by correcting the\nsystematic shifts for each tile using second-order two-dimensional polynomial\nfitting combined with a numerical stellar flat-field correction method. The\nre-calibrated results from the XPSP and the SCR standards are consistent within\n6\\,mmag in the USS zero-points, demonstrating both the typical precision of\nre-calibrated USS photometry and a sixfold improvement in USS zero-point\nprecision. Further validation using SDSS and Pan-STARRS1, as well as LAMOST\nDR10 and Gaia photometry, also confirms this precision for the re-calibrated\nUSS photometry. Our results clearly demonstrate the capability and the\nefficiency of the BEST database in improving calibration precision to the\nmilli-magnitude level for wide-field photometric surveys.

One such approach is\nbased on the assumption that baryonic density fields in the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM) follow lognormal distribution. Keeping this in mind, we extend our\nearlier work to improve the lognormal model of the Ly$\\alpha$ forest in\nrecovering the parameters characterizing IGM state, particularly the hydrogen\nphotoionization rate ($\\Gamma_{12}$), between $2.2 \\leq z \\leq 2.7$, by\nsimulating the model spectra at a slightly lower redshift than the Sherwood\nsmooth particle hydrodynamical simulations (SPH) data. The recovery of thermal\nparameters, namely, the mean-density IGM temperature ($T_0$) and the slope of\nthe temperature-density relation ($\\gamma$) is also alleviated. These\nparameters are estimated through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique,\nusing the mean and power spectrum of the transmitted flux. We find that the\nusual lognormal distribution of IGM densities tend to over-predict the number\nof Ly$\\alpha$ absorbers seen in SPH simulation. A lognormal model simulated at\na lower redshift than SPH data can address this limitation to a certain extent.\nWe show that with such a \"trailing\" model of lognormal distribution, values of\n$\\Gamma_{12}$ are recovered at $\\lesssim 1-\\sigma$.

    "abstract": "Pulsars are often lauded for their (relative) rotational and radio emission\nstability over long time scales. However, long-term observing programmes are\nidentifying an increasing number of pulsars that deviate from this preconceived\nnotion. Using Gaussian process regression and Bayesian inference techniques, we\ninvestigated the emission and rotational stability of 259 isolated radio\npulsars that have been monitored using Murriyang, the Parkes 64 m radio\ntelescope, over the past three decades. We found that 238 pulsars display\nsignificant variability in their spin-down rates, 52 of which also exhibit\nchanges in profile shape. Including 23 known state-switching pulsars, this\nrepresents the largest catalogue of variable pulsars identified to date and\nindicates that these behaviours are ubiquitous among the wider population. The\nintensity of spin-down fluctuations positively scales with increasing pulsar\nspin-down rate, with only a marginal dependence on spin-frequency. This may\nhave substantial implications for ongoing searches for gravitational waves in\nthe ensemble timing of millisecond pulsars. We also discuss challenges in\nexplaining the physical origins of quasi-periodic and transient\nprofile/spin-down variations detected among a subset of our pulsars.",

However, it remains unclear whether more exotic states, such\nas composite Fermi liquid and MooreRead states, can appear at half filling.\nHere we surprisingly find the existence of composite Fermi liquid, Moore-Read\nstates and charge density waves in the same Weyl-orbit-based Landau level of a\nWeyl semimetal and their transitions induced by varying the distance between\nWeyl points. We attribute these transitions to a significant change in the\nsingle-particle wave functions of the Landau level as the distance between Weyl\npoints is varied.

The extinction law is most uniform in RIK\nand RJK and the distances to individual RR~Lyrae based on these colors are\ndetermined with an accuracy six and four percent, respectively. Using only the\nnear-infrared passbands for distance estimation we inferred the distance to the\nGalactic center equal to djk = 8.2 +- 0.001(stat) +- 0.53(sys)pc after\ngeometrical correction. We show that variations in the extinction law toward\nthe Galactic bulge can mimic a barred spatial distribution in the bulge\nRR~Lyrae star population in visual passbands. This arises from a gradient in\nextinction differences along Galactic longitudes and latitudes, which can\ncreate the perception of the Galactic bar, particularly when using visual\npassband-based distances. A barred angle in the RR~Lyrae spatial distribution\ndisappears when near-infrared passband-based distances are used, as well as\nwhen reddening law variations are incorporated in visual passband-based\ndistances. The prominence of the bar, as traced by RR~Lyrae stars, depends on\ntheir metallicity, with metal-poor RR~Lyrae stars ([Fe/H]<-1.0dex) showing\nlittle to no tilt with respect to the bar. Metal-rich ([Fe/H]>-1.0dex) RR~Lyrae\nstars do show a barred/bulge signature in spatial properties derived using\nnear-infrared distances, with an angle {\\iota} = 18 +- 5deg, consistent with\nprevious bar measurements from the literature. The 5D kinematic analysis,\nprimarily based on transverse velocities, indicates a rotational lag in\nRR~Lyrae stars compared to red clump giants.

In this paper,\nwe present a framework based on any single text-to-image model without reliance\non the explicit image-to-image model thus enhancing the generalizability and\nscalability.

We\ninvestigate the coalescence and pinch-off processes in SRFs and compare them to\nthose in NFs. Our simulations reveal that SRFs undergo pinch-off earlier than\nNFs. We also observe that increasing the Ohnesorge number Oh suppresses the\npinch-off process, highlighting the relative role of viscous forces, which is\nmodulated by gravity effects or the Bond number Bo. Furthermore, we explore how\nvarying the dimensionless linear and quadratic sensitivity coefficients of\nsurface tension on temperature, M1 and M2, respectively, and the dimensionless\nheat flux Q influence the coalescence/pinch-off behavior. Interestingly,\ncontrary to the behavior in NFs, in SRFs increasing M2, or Q reduces the time\nrequired to pinch-off and widens the region in the Oh-Bo regime map where\npinch-off occurs, when compared to the unheated cases. These differences are\nshown to be due to the variations in the thermocapillary forces on the\ninterface.

Existing\nmethods often learn subject representation and incorporate it into the prompt\nembedding to guide image generation, but they struggle with preserving subject\nfidelity. To solve this issue, this paper approaches a novel framework named\nSceneBooth for subject-preserved text-to-image generation, which consumes\ninputs of a subject image, object phrases and text prompts. Instead of learning\nthe subject representation and generating a subject, our SceneBooth fixes the\ngiven subject image and generates its background image guided by the text\nprompts. To this end, our SceneBooth introduces two key components, i.e., a\nmultimodal layout generation module and a background painting module. The\nformer determines the position and scale of the subject by generating\nappropriate scene layouts that align with text captions, object phrases, and\nsubject visual information. The latter integrates two adapters (ControlNet and\nGated Self-Attention) into the latent diffusion model to generate a background\nthat harmonizes with the subject guided by scene layouts and text descriptions.\nIn this manner, our SceneBooth ensures accurate preservation of the subject's\nappearance in the output.

While PI offers a promising solution, its practical\ndeployment is hindered by substantial communication and latency overheads,\nprimarily stemming from nonlinear operations. To address this, we introduce an\ninformation-theoretic framework to characterize the role of nonlinearities in\ndecoder-only language models, laying a principled foundation for optimizing\ntransformer-architectures tailored to the demands of PI.\n  By leveraging Shannon's entropy as a quantitative measure, we uncover the\npreviously unexplored dual significance of nonlinearities: beyond ensuring\ntraining stability, they are crucial for maintaining attention head diversity.\nSpecifically, we find that their removal triggers two critical failure modes:\n{\\em entropy collapse} in deeper layers that destabilizes training, and {\\em\nentropic overload} in earlier layers that leads to under-utilization of\nMulti-Head Attention's (MHA) representational capacity.\n  We propose an entropy-guided attention mechanism paired with a novel entropy\nregularization technique to mitigate entropic overload. Additionally, we\nexplore PI-friendly alternatives to layer normalization for preventing entropy\ncollapse and stabilizing the training of LLMs with reduced-nonlinearities. Our\nstudy bridges the gap between information theory and architectural design,\nestablishing entropy dynamics as a principled guide for developing efficient PI\narchitectures.

    "abstract": "The Chernoff bound is one of the most widely used tools in theoretical\ncomputer science. It's rare to find a randomized algorithm that doesn't employ\na Chernoff bound in its analysis. The standard proofs of Chernoff bounds are\nbeautiful but in some ways not very intuitive. In this paper, I'll show you a\ndifferent proof that has four features: (1) the proof offers a strong intuition\nfor why Chernoff bounds look the way that they do; (2) the proof is\nuser-friendly and (almost) algebra-free; (3) the proof comes with matching\nlower bounds, up to constant factors in the exponent; and (4) the proof extends\nto establish generalizations of Chernoff bounds in other settings. The ultimate\ngoal is that, once you know this proof (and with a bit of practice), you should\nbe able to confidently reason about Chernoff-style bounds in your head,\nextending them to other settings, and convincing yourself that the bounds\nyou're obtaining are tight (up to constant factors in the exponent).",

    "abstract": "Newton-type solvers have been extensively employed for solving a variety of\nnonlinear system of algebraic equations. However, for some complex nonlinear\nsystem of algebraic equations, efficiently solving these systems remains a\nchallenging task. The primary reason for this challenge arises from the\nunbalanced nonlinearities within the nonlinear system. Therefore, accurately\nidentifying and balancing the unbalanced nonlinearities in the system is\nessential. In this work, we propose a residual-driven adaptive strategy to\nidentify and balance the nonlinearities in the system. The fundamental idea\nbehind this strategy is to assign an adaptive weight multiplier to each\ncomponent of the nonlinear system, with these weight multipliers increasing\naccording to a specific update rule as the residual components increase,\nthereby enabling the Newton-type solver to select a more appropriate step\nlength, ensuring that each component in the nonlinear system experiences\nsufficient reduction rather than competing against each other. More\nimportantly, our strategy yields negligible additional computational overhead\nand can be seamlessly integrated with other Newton-type solvers, contributing\nto the improvement of their efficiency and robustness. We test our algorithm on\na variety of benchmark problems, including a chemical equilibrium system, a\nconvective diffusion problem, and a series of challenging nonlinear systems.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm not only outperforms\nexisting Newton-type solvers in terms of computational efficiency but also\nexhibits superior robustness, particularly in handling systems with highly\nimbalanced nonlinearities.",

Despite\ntechnological advances, in-situ measurements of $d_\\alpha$ are often\nunachievable due to harsh deposition conditions, such as high temperatures or\nreactive environments. In this paper, we propose a fitting approach to\ndetermine $d_\\alpha$ from experimental data by leveraging inter-surface\ndiffusion between a substrate and a strip obtained by, for example, processing\na film. The substrate serves as a source or sink of precursors, influencing the\ngrowth dynamics and shaping the profile of the strip. By fitting simulated\nprofiles to given profiles, we demonstrate that $d_\\alpha$ can be determined.\nTo achieve this, we develop a theoretical growth model, a simulation strategy,\nand a fitting procedure. The growth model incorporates inter-surface diffusion,\nadsorption, and desorption of growth precursors, with growth being proportional\nto the concentration of adsorbed precursors. In our simulations, a chain of\nnodes represents a profile, and growth is captured by the displacement of those\nnodes, while keeping the node density approximately constant. For strips\nsignificantly wider than $d_\\alpha$, a scaled precursor concentration and\n$d_\\alpha$ are the fitting parameters that are determined by minimizing a\nsuitably defined measure of the distance between simulated and given profiles.\nWe evaluate the robustness of our procedure by analyzing the effect of profile\nresolution and noise on the fitted parameters.

Therefore, it's challenging to predict what\nwould occur during the transformation between two different topological phases.\nTo address these issues, we propose a general definition based on fidelity and\ntrace distance from quantum information theory: manifold distance (MD). This\ndefinition does not rely on the berry connection but rather on the information\nof the two manifolds - their ground state wave functions. Thus, it can measure\ndifferent topological systems (including traditional band topology models,\nnon-Hermitian systems, and gapless systems, etc.) and exhibit some universal\nlaws during the transformation between two topological phases. Our research\ndemonstrates for different topological manifolds, the change rate (first-order\nderivative) or susceptibility (second-order derivative) of MD exhibit various\ndivergent behaviors near the critical points. Compared to the strange\ncorrelator, which could be used as a diagnosis for short-range entangled states\nin 1D and 2D, MD is more universal and could be applied to non-Hermitian\nsystems and long-range entangled states.

Moreover, the standard\nfully connected layer segmentation approach faces significant challenges in\nhandling multiple classes and exhibits poor generalizability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the VOxel Interacting with LAnguage method (VOILA) for\nuniversal CT image segmentation.

Although the point that employs\nthe variation of polarization angle due to reflection or transmission at the\nsample is similar to classical polarization microscopy, the method for\nconstructing image contrast is significantly different. Image contrast is\nconstructed by the coincidence count of signal and idler photons.

These different thermal states can be switched by\nslightly changing the photon polarization, which is suddenly aroused within\nnarrow range of analyzer angle.

The context for\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in most benchmarks comes from\nWikipedia or Wikipedia-like texts which are written in a neutral and factual\ntone. However, when RAG systems retrieve internet-based content, they encounter\ntext with diverse tones and linguistic styles, introducing challenges for\ndownstream tasks. The Reading with Intent task addresses this issue by\nevaluating how varying tones in context passages affect model performance.\nBuilding on prior work that focused on sarcasm, we extend this paradigm by\nconstructing a dataset where context passages are transformed to $11$ distinct\nemotions using a better synthetic data generation approach. Using this dataset,\nwe train an emotion translation model to systematically adapt passages to\nspecified emotional tones. The human evaluation shows that the LLM fine-tuned\nto become the emotion-translator benefited from the synthetically generated\ndata. Finally, the emotion-translator is used in the Reading with Intent task\nto transform the passages to a neutral tone. By neutralizing the passages, it\nmitigates the challenges posed by sarcastic passages and improves overall\nresults on this task by about $3\\%$.",

To adequately spread a foam or cream over a surface,\nexternal force must be applied to artificially scrape it. The scraping of foam\nusing a rigid plate has been observed to exhibit complex behavior distinct from\nthat of simple liquids. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the\ntransition between partial and slender scraping regimes by examining changes in\ninternal structure and partial spreading lengths. Our findings reveal that the\nsequential propagation of bubble rearrangement in the foam's internal structure\nleads to the partial scraping. Moreover, the scraping length in the partial\nscraping regime shows divergence near the transition point, characterized by a\ncritical exponent of approximately 0.61. These results imply that foam scraping\nis governed by directional percolation theory, supported by the agreement\nbetween the experimentally observed critical exponent and theoretical\npredictions.

    "abstract": "Vocabulary acquisition is essential to second language learning, as it\nunderpins all core language skills. Accurate vocabulary assessment is\nparticularly important in standardized exams, where test items evaluate\nlearners' comprehension and contextual use of words. Previous research has\nexplored methods for generating distractors to aid in the design of English\nvocabulary tests. However, current approaches often rely on lexical databases\nor predefined rules, and frequently produce distractors that risk invalidating\nthe question by introducing multiple correct options. In this study, we focus\non English vocabulary questions from Taiwan's university entrance exams. We\nanalyze student response distributions to gain insights into the\ncharacteristics of these test items and provide a reference for future\nresearch. Additionally, we identify key limitations in how large language\nmodels (LLMs) support teachers in generating distractors for vocabulary test\ndesign. To address these challenges, we propose the iterative selection with\nself-review (ISSR) framework, which makes use of a novel LLM-based self-review\nmechanism to ensure that the distractors remain valid while offering diverse\noptions. Experimental results show that ISSR achieves promising performance in\ngenerating plausible distractors, and the self-review mechanism effectively\nfilters out distractors that could invalidate the question.",

Recent advances in deep learning have shown significant\npotential in improving RSR in domains with ample annotated data. However, these\nmethods fall short in EW scenarios where annotated radio frequency (RF) data\nare scarce or impractical to obtain. To address these challenges, we introduce\na self-supervised learning (SSL) method which utilises masked signal modelling\nand RF domain adaption to perform few-shot RSR and enhance performance in\nenvironments with limited RF samples and annotations. We propose a two-step\napproach, first pre-training masked autoencoders (MAE) on baseband in-phase and\nquadrature (I/Q) signals from diverse RF domains, and then transferring the\nlearned representations to the radar domain, where annotated data are scarce.\nEmpirical results show that our lightweight self-supervised ResNet1D model with\ndomain adaptation achieves up to a 17.5% improvement in 1-shot classification\naccuracy when pre-trained on in-domain signals (i.e., radar signals) and up to\na 16.31% improvement when pre-trained on out-of-domain signals (i.e., comm\nsignals), compared to its baseline without using SSL.

Quantum chemistry simulations such as DFT provide accurate\npredictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their feasibility for\nlarge-scale materials screening. Shallow ML models offer faster alternatives\nbut typically require extensive data preprocessing to convert non-numerical\nmaterial features into structured numerical inputs, often at the cost of losing\ncritical descriptive information. In contrast, our approach leverages\npretrained language models to process textual data directly, eliminating the\nneed for manual feature engineering. We construct material descriptions in two\nformats: structured strings that combine key features in a consistent template,\nand natural language narratives generated using the ChatGPT API. For each\nmodel, we append a custom regression head and perform task-specific finetuning\non a curated dataset of inorganic compounds. Our results show that finetuned\nlanguage models, particularly the decoder-only LLaMA-3 architecture, can\noutperform conventional approaches in prediction accuracy and flexibility,\nachieving an MAE of 0.25 eV and R2 of 0.89, compared to the best shallow ML\nbaseline, which achieved an MAE of 0.32 eV and R2 of 0.84.

Most commonly, the velocity field inside adhering droplets is\nmeasured by means of particle image velocimetry (PIV), which requires a\ncorrection step for distortion caused by refraction of light at the gas-liquid\ninterface. Current methods for distortion correction based on ray tracing are\nlimited to low external flow velocities. However, the ray-tracing method can be\nextended to arbitrarily deformed droplet shapes if the instantaneous\nthree-dimensional droplet interface is availble. In the present work, a\npreviously introduced method for the image-based reconstruction of gas-liquid\ninterfaces by means of deep learning is adapted to determine the instantaneous\ninterface of adhering droplets in external shear flows. In this regard, a\npurposefully developed optical measurement technique based on the shadowgraphy\nmethod is employed that encodes additional three-dimensional (3D) information\nof the interface in the images via glare points from lateral light sources. On\nthe basis of the images recorded in the experiments, the volumetric shape of\nthe droplet is reconstructed by a neural network that was trained on the\nspatio-temporal dynamics of the gas-liquid interface from a synthetic dataset\nobtained by numerical simulation. The results for experiments with adhering\ndroplets at different velocities of external flow demonstrate that the\ncombination of the learned droplet geometry with the depth encoding through the\nglare points facilitates a robust and flexible reconstruction. The proposed\nmethod reconstructs the instantaneous three-dimensional interface of adhering\ndroplets at both high resolution and spatial accuracy and thereby enables the\ndistortion correction of PIV measurements at high external flow velocities.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the application of Reed-Muller (RM) codes for\nPhysical-layer security in a real world wiretap channel scenario. Utilizing\nsoftware-defined radios (SDRs) in a real indoor environment, we implement a\ncoset coding scheme that leverages the hierarchical structure of RM codes to\nsecure data transmission. The generator matrix of the RM code is used to\npartition codewords into cosets in the usual way, where each message\ncorresponds to a unique coset, and auxiliary bits select specific codewords\nwithin each coset. This approach enables the legitimate receiver (Bob) can\ndecode the transmitted message with minimal information leakage to eavesdropper\n(Eve) thus protecting the confidentiality of the communication with the help of\ncoset structure. Mutual information neural estimation (MINE) is used to\nquantify information leakage and validate the effectiveness of the scheme.\nExperimental results indicate that RM codes can achieve robust security even in\npractical environments affected by real-world channel impairments. These\nfindings demonstrate the potential of RM codes as an efficient solution for\nphysical-layer security, particularly for applications that require low latency\nand short blocklengths.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention in recent years due\nto its distributed nature and privacy preserving benefits. However, a key\nlimitation of conventional FL is that it learns and distributes a common global\nmodel to all participants, which fails to provide customized solutions for\ndiverse task requirements. Federated meta-learning (FML) offers a promising\nsolution to this issue by enabling devices to finetune local models after\nreceiving a shared meta-model from the server. In this paper, we propose a\ntask-oriented FML framework over non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)\nnetworks. A novel metric, termed value of learning (VoL), is introduced to\nassess the individual training needs across devices. Moreover, a task-level\nweight (TLW) metric is defined based on task requirements and fairness\nconsiderations, guiding the prioritization of edge devices during FML training.\nThe formulated problem, to maximize the sum of TLW-based VoL across devices,\nforms a non-convex mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) challenge,\naddressed here using a parameterized deep Q-network (PDQN) algorithm to handle\nboth discrete and continuous variables. Simulation results demonstrate that our\napproach significantly outperforms baseline schemes, underscoring the\nadvantages of the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Large language models that enhance software development tasks, such as code\ngeneration, code completion, and code question answering (QA), have been\nextensively studied in both academia and the industry. The models are\nintegrated into popular intelligent IDEs like JetBrains and Cursor. Current\nbenchmarks for evaluating models' code comprehension capabilities primarily\nfocus on code generation or completion, often neglecting QA, which is a crucial\naspect of understanding code. Existing code QA benchmarks are derived from code\ncomments with predefined patterns (e.g., CodeQA) or focus on specific domains,\nsuch as education (e.g., CS1QA). These benchmarks fail to capture the\nreal-world complexity of software engineering and user requirements for\nunderstanding code repositories. To address this gap, we introduce CoReQA, a\nbenchmark for Code Repository-level question answering, constructed from GitHub\nissues and comments from 176 popular repositories across four programming\nlanguages. Since questions and answers may include both natural language and\ncode snippets, traditional evaluation metrics such as BLEU are inadequate for\nassessing repository-level QA performance. Thus, we provide an LLM-as-a-judge\nframework to evaluate QA performance from five aspects. Based on CoReQA, we\nevaluate the performance of three baselines, including two short-context models\nusing generic retrieval strategies and one long-context model that utilizes the\nentire repository context. Evaluation results show that state-of-the-art\nproprietary and long-context models struggle to address repository-level\nquestions effectively. Our analysis highlights the limitations of language\nmodels in assisting developers in understanding repositories and suggests\nfuture directions for improving repository comprehension systems through\neffective context retrieval methodologies.",

    "abstract": "To aid urban air mobility (UAM), electric vertical takeoff and landing\n(eVTOL) aircraft are being targeted. Conventional multidisciplinary analysis\nand optimization (MDAO) can be expensive, while surrogate-based optimization\ncan struggle with challenging physical constraints. This work proposes\nphysics-constrained generative adversarial networks (physicsGAN), to\nintelligently parameterize the takeoff control profiles of an eVTOL aircraft\nand to transform the original design space to a feasible space. Specifically,\nthe transformed feasible space refers to a space where all designs directly\nsatisfy all design constraints. The physicsGAN-enabled surrogate-based takeoff\ntrajectory design framework was demonstrated on the Airbus A3 Vahana. The\nphysicsGAN generated only feasible control profiles of power and wing angle in\nthe feasible space with around 98.9% of designs satisfying all constraints. The\nproposed design framework obtained 99.6% accuracy compared with\nsimulation-based optimal design and took only 2.2 seconds, which reduced the\ncomputational time by around 200 times. Meanwhile, data-driven GAN-enabled\nsurrogate-based optimization took 21.9 seconds using a derivative-free\noptimizer, which was around an order of magnitude slower than the proposed\nframework. Moreover, the data-driven GAN-based optimization using\ngradient-based optimizers could not consistently find the optimal design during\nrandom trials and got stuck in an infeasible region, which is problematic in\nreal practice. Therefore, the proposed physicsGAN-based design framework\noutperformed data-driven GAN-based design to the extent of efficiency (2.2\nseconds), optimality (99.6% accurate), and feasibility (100% feasible).\nAccording to the literature review, this is the first physics-constrained\ngenerative artificial intelligence enabled by surrogate models.",

However,\ndespite its effectiveness, the system faces inefficiencies in resource\nutilization, leading to a high rate of premature build aborts and delays in\nlanding smaller changes blocked by larger conflicting ones. This paper\nintroduces enhancements to SubmitQueue, focusing on optimizing resource usage\nand improving build prioritization. Central to this is our innovative\nprobabilistic model, which distinguishes between changes with shorter and\nlonger build times to prioritize builds for more efficient scheduling. By\nleveraging a machine learning model to predict build times and incorporating\nthis into the probabilistic framework, we expedite the landing of smaller\nchanges blocked by conflicting larger time-consuming changes. Additionally,\nintroducing a concept of speculation threshold ensures that only the most\nlikely builds are executed, reducing unnecessary resource consumption. After\nimplementing these enhancements across Uber's major monorepos (Go, iOS, and\nAndroid), we observed a reduction in Continuous Integration (CI) resource usage\nby approximately 53%, CPU usage by 44%, and P95 waiting times by 37%.
