    "abstract": "This study examines second-order dynamical systems incorporating Tikhonov\nregularization. It focuses on how nonlinearities induce bifurcations and\nchaotic dynamics. By using Lyapunov functions, bifurcation theory, and\nnumerical simulations, we identify critical transitions that lead to complex\nbehaviors like strange attractors and chaos. The findings provide a theoretical\nframework for applications in optimization, machine learning, and biological\nmodeling. Key contributions include stability conditions, characterization of\nchaotic regimes, and methods for managing nonlinear instabilities in\ninterdisciplinary systems.",

    "abstract": "In these notes, while focusing on the meson-nucleon vertices, we give a\nderivation of the nucleon-nucleon 9NN) potentials from meson-exchange between\nquarks. To establish such a relation the quark-quark-meson (QQM) interactions\nare properly defined. Hitherto, the coefficients in the Pauli-spinor expansion\nof the meson-nucleon-nucleon (NNM) vertices are equated with those of the\nQQM-vertices. In these notes we employ the description of the nucleon with\nDirac-spinors in the SU(6) semi-relativistic \"constituent\" quark-model (CQM) as\nformulated by LeYouanc, et al. It appears that the constituent quark model with\n$m_q= M_N/3$, is able to produce the same ratio's for the central-, spin-spin-,\ntensor-, spin-orbit-, and quadratic-spin-orbit Pauli-invariants as in the\nphenomenological NNM-vertices. In order to achieve this, the scalar-,\nmagnetic-vector, and axial-vector interactions require, besides the standard\nones, an extra coupling to the quarks without the introduction of new\nparameters. in the case of the axial-vector mesons an extra coupling to the\nquarks is necessary, which is related to the quark orbital angular momentum\ncontribution to the nucleon spin. Furthermore, a momentum correlation between\nthe quark that is coupled to the meson and the remaining quark pair, and a\n(gaussian) QQM form factor, are necessary to avoid \"spurious\" terms. From these\nresults we have obtained a formulation of the QQ-interactions which is directly\nrelated to the NN extended-soft-core (ESC) interactions. This has been applied\nto mixed quark-nuclear matter in a study of (heavy) neutron stars.",

Considering a 16x16 PE array in Tempus\nCore, area and power improves by 75% and 62%, respectively, while delivering 5x\nand 4x iso-area throughput improvements for INT8 and INT4 precisions.\nPost-place and route analysis of Tempus Core's PCU shows that the 16x4 PE array\nfor INT4 precision in 45nm CMOS requires only 0.017 mm^2 die area and consumes\nonly 6.2mW of total power.

To tackle this challenge, we\nredefine high-magnification SR as the ultra-resolution (UR) problem, reframing\nit as solving a conditional diffusion stochastic differential equation (SDE).\nIn this context, we propose WaveDiffUR, a novel wavelet-domain diffusion UR\nsolver that decomposes the UR process into sequential sub-processes addressing\nconditional wavelet components. WaveDiffUR iteratively reconstructs\nlow-frequency wavelet details (ensuring global consistency) and high-frequency\ncomponents (enhancing local fidelity) by incorporating pre-trained SR models as\nplug-and-play modules. This modularity mitigates the ill-posedness of the SDE\nand ensures scalability across diverse applications. To address limitations in\nfixed boundary conditions at extreme magnifications, we introduce the\ncross-scale pyramid (CSP) constraint, a dynamic and adaptive framework that\nguides WaveDiffUR in generating fine-grained wavelet details, ensuring\nconsistent and high-fidelity outputs even at extreme magnification rates.",

A dataset containing normal traffic and various DDoS attacks was used\nto train a neural network model with a 24-106-5 architecture. The model\nachieved high Accuracy (99.35%), Precision (99.32%), Recall (99.54%), and\nF-score (0.99) in the classification task. All major attack types were\ncorrectly identified. The model was also further tested in the lab using\nvirtual infrastructures to generate normal and DDoS traffic. The results showed\nthat the model can accurately classify attacks under near-real-world\nconditions, demonstrating 95.05% accuracy and balanced F-score scores for all\nattack types.

To address this, we propose a multi-cell sleep\nstrategy combined with adaptive cell zooming, user association, and\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to minimize BS energy consumption.\nThis approach allows BSs to enter sleep during low traffic, while adaptive cell\nzooming and user association dynamically adjust coverage to balance traffic\nload and enhance data rates through RIS, minimizing the number of active BSs.\nHowever, it is important to note that the proposed method may achieve\nenergy-savings at the cost of increased delay, requiring a trade-off between\nthese two factors. Moreover, minimizing BS energy consumption under the delay\nconstraint is a complicated non-convex problem. To address this issue, we model\nthe RIS-aided multi-cell network as a Markov decision process (MDP) and use the\nproximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to optimize sleep mode (SM), cell\nzooming, and user association. Besides, we utilize a double cascade correlation\nnetwork (DCCN) algorithm to optimize the RIS reflection coefficients.\nSimulation results demonstrate that PPO balances energy-savings and delay,\nwhile DCCN-optimized RIS enhances BS energy-savings.

    "abstract": "We explore various aspects of semi-classical spin hydrodynamics, where\nhydrodynamic currents are derived from an expansion in the reduced Planck\nconstant $\\hbar$, incorporating both flat and curved spacetimes. After\nestablishing covariant definitions for angular momentum currents, we\ndemonstrate that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor requires\nmodifications involving the Riemann curvature and the spin tensors. We also\nrevise pseudo-gauge transformations to ensure their applicability in curved\nspacetimes. Key assumptions for semi-classical spin hydrodynamics are\nintroduced, enabling studies without explicitly invoking quantum kinetic\ntheory. We derive and analyze the linearized semi-classical spin hydrodynamic\nequations, proving that spin and fluid modes decouple in the linear regime. As\na concrete example, we study the ideal-spin approximation in a dissipative\nfluid with shear viscosity. This analysis confirms our general result: the\ndamping of spin waves is governed solely by spin relaxation time coefficients,\nindependent of linear fluid perturbations. We also examine the Gibbs stability\ncriterion and reveal its limitations at first order in $\\hbar$, signaling the\ninherent anisotropy of the equilibrium state, which remains unaddressed in\ncurrent semi-classical spin hydrodynamics formulations. Finally, within a\nconformal Bjorken flow background and using the slow-roll approximation\nattractor for the fluid sector, we show that the relaxation of the spin\npotential is governed by spin relaxation time coefficients, mirroring the\ndamping behavior of spin waves in the linear regime.",

    "abstract": "Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects that blend\nseamlessly into their surroundings. The inherent visual complexity of\ncamouflaged objects, including their low contrast with the background, diverse\ntextures, and subtle appearance variations, often obscures semantic cues,\nmaking accurate segmentation highly challenging. Existing methods primarily\nrely on visual features, which are insufficient to handle the variability and\nintricacy of camouflaged objects, leading to unstable object perception and\nambiguous segmentation results. To tackle these limitations, we introduce a\nnovel task, class-guided camouflaged object detection (CGCOD), which extends\ntraditional COD task by incorporating object-specific class knowledge to\nenhance detection robustness and accuracy. To facilitate this task, we present\na new dataset, CamoClass, comprising real-world camouflaged objects with class\nannotations. Furthermore, we propose a multi-stage framework, CGNet, which\nincorporates a plug-and-play class prompt generator and a simple yet effective\nclass-guided detector. This establishes a new paradigm for COD, bridging the\ngap between contextual understanding and class-guided detection. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our flexible framework in\nimproving the performance of proposed and existing detectors by leveraging\nclass-level textual information.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of natural language processing (NLP) and pre-trained\nlanguage models have enabled accurate text classification in a variety of\nsettings. However, text classification models are susceptible to backdoor\nattacks, where an attacker embeds a trigger into the victim model to make the\nmodel predict attacker-desired labels in targeted scenarios. In this paper, we\npropose to utilize backdoor attacks for a new purpose: bias injection. We\ndevelop a backdoor attack in which a subset of the training dataset is poisoned\nto associate strong male actors with negative sentiment. We execute our attack\non two popular text classification datasets (IMDb and SST) and seven different\nmodels ranging from traditional Doc2Vec-based models to LSTM networks and\nmodern transformer-based BERT and RoBERTa models. Our results show that the\nreduction in backdoored models' benign classification accuracy is limited,\nimplying that our attacks remain stealthy, whereas the models successfully\nlearn to associate strong male actors with negative sentiment (100% attack\nsuccess rate with >= 3% poison rate). Attacks on BERT and RoBERTa are\nparticularly more stealthy and effective, demonstrating an increased risk of\nusing modern and larger models. We also measure the generalizability of our\nbias injection by proposing two metrics: (i) U-BBSR which uses previously\nunseen words when measuring attack success, and (ii) P-BBSR which measures\nattack success using paraphrased test samples. U-BBSR and P-BBSR results show\nthat the bias injected by our attack can go beyond memorizing a trigger phrase.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen grain boundary (GB) trapping is widely accepted as the main cause\nfor hydrogen induced intergranular failure. Several studies were conducted to\nunveil the role of GBs on hydrogen transport; however, a clear understanding is\nyet to be attained. This is due to the limitations of the state-of-the-art\nexperimental procedures for such highly kinetic processes. In this study, we\naim at providing a deeper understanding of hydrogen-GB interactions using\nfull-field representative volume element (RVE). The phase-field method is\nchosen for generating RVEs, since it is the an appropriate numerical tool to\nrepresent GBs. A novel fully-kinetic formulation for hydrogen diffusion and GB\ntrapping is presented, which is compatible with the phase-field based RVEs. GB\ndiffusivity ($D_\\mathrm{gb}$) and trap-binding energy ($E_\\mathrm{gb}$) were\nused as parameters to understand the interactions between diffusion and GB\ntrapping. Uptake and permeation simulations were performed with constant and\ngradient occupancy boundary conditions respectively. In both cases, increasing\n$E_\\mathrm{gb}$, increased the hydrogen GB occupancy. The permeation\nsimulations showed that the hydrogen flux along the GBs increased with\nincreasing both, $D_\\mathrm{gb}$ and, surprisingly, $E_\\mathrm{gb}$. Since\ntrapping increases the hydrogen occupancy along GBs, it also increases the\noccupancy gradients, resulting in a higher flux. This led to the conclusion\nthat, in the case of an external occupancy gradient, GB trapping and diffusion\ncooperate, rather than compete, to increase the hydrogen flux. On the other\nhand, the decisive factor for the retention of hydrogen at the GBs in\npermeation simulations was $D_\\mathrm{gb}$ rather than $E_\\mathrm{gb}$.",

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of multimedia contents has led to the emergence of\nmultimodal recommendation systems. It has attracted increasing attention in\nrecommendation systems because its full utilization of data from different\nmodalities alleviates the persistent data sparsity problem. As such, multimodal\nrecommendation models can learn personalized information about nodes in terms\nof visual and textual. To further alleviate the data sparsity problem, some\nprevious works have introduced graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for\nmultimodal recommendation systems, to enhance the semantic representation of\nusers and items by capturing the potential relationships between them. However,\nadopting GCNs inevitably introduces the over-smoothing problem, which make\nnodes to be too similar. Unfortunately, incorporating multimodal information\nwill exacerbate this challenge because nodes that are too similar will lose the\npersonalized information learned through multimodal information. To address\nthis problem, we propose a novel model that retains the personalized\ninformation of ego nodes during feature aggregation by Reducing Node-neighbor\nDiscrepancy (RedN^nD). Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that\nRedN^nD achieves state-of-the-art performance on accuracy and robustness, with\nsignificant improvements over existing GCN-based multimodal frameworks.",

With edge computing, resources are brought closer to users in\nefforts to reduce latency and improve QoEs. However, VR's dynamic nature, with\nchanging fields of view (FoVs) and user synchronization requirements, creates\nvarious challenges for edge caching. We address the lack of suitable benchmarks\nand propose a framework that simulates multiuser VR scenarios while logging\nusers' interaction with objects within their actual and predicted FoVs. The\nbenchmark's activity log can then be played back through an edge cache to\nassess the resulting QoEs.

    "abstract": "Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated potential in\nhealthcare applications, yet their propensity for hallucinations -- generating\nmedically implausible or inaccurate information -- presents substantial risks\nto patient care. This paper introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark\nframework for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our\nmethodology integrates expert-validated medical case scenarios with established\nmedical databases to create a robust evaluation dataset. The framework employs\na sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic\nCaption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous\nclinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to\nachieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical\napplications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse\nclinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted\ncomparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to\nestablish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our\nfindings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the\neffects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting\nits advantages in hallucination assessment. This research establishes a\nfoundational framework for enhancing MLLMs' reliability in healthcare settings\nand presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge of AI\nhallucinations in medical applications.",

However, adapting to varying safety\nconstraints during deployment without retraining remains an under-explored\nchallenge. To address this challenge, we introduce constraint-adaptive policy\nswitching (CAPS), a wrapper framework around existing offline RL algorithms.\nDuring training, CAPS uses offline data to learn multiple policies with a\nshared representation that optimize different reward and cost trade-offs.\nDuring testing, CAPS switches between those policies by selecting at each state\nthe policy that maximizes future rewards among those that satisfy the current\ncost constraint. Our experiments on 38 tasks from the DSRL benchmark\ndemonstrate that CAPS consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a\nstrong wrapper-based baseline for OSRL.

Then, a three-layer neural network is employed to approximate the\nunknown nonlinearities, and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is adopted to get a\nrelative accurate slow system.

In the following, the stability and\n$\\textbf{\\textit{H}}_\\infty$ performance issues of the closed-loop system are\ndiscussed, and the controllers are displayed in terms of bilinear matrix\ninequalities (BMIs).

These devices typically feature\nrelatively weaker GPUs and stronger CPUs. Although techniques such as parameter\noffloading and partial offloading can alleviate GPU memory pressure to some\nextent, their effectiveness is limited due to communication latency and\nsuboptimal hardware resource utilization. To address this issue, we propose\nDovetail, a lossless inference acceleration method that leverages the\ncomplementary characteristics of heterogeneous devices and the advantages of\nspeculative decoding. Dovetail deploys a draft model on the GPU to perform\npreliminary predictions, while a target model running on the CPU validates\nthese outputs. By reducing the granularity of data transfer, Dovetail\nsignificantly minimizes communication overhead. To further improve efficiency,\nwe optimize the draft model specifically for heterogeneous hardware\nenvironments by reducing the number of draft tokens to lower parallel\nverification latency, increasing model depth to enhance predictive\ncapabilities, and introducing a Dynamic Gating Fusion (DGF) mechanism to\nimprove the integration of feature and embedding information. We conduct\ncomprehensive evaluations of Dovetail across various consumer-grade GPUs,\ncovering multiple tasks and mainstream models. Experimental results on 13B\nmodels demonstrate that Dovetail achieves inference speedups ranging from 1.79x\nto 10.1x across different devices, while maintaining consistency and stability\nin the distribution of generated texts.",

    "abstract": "Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) has been actively researched for\nuser-generated content (UGC) videos. Recently, super-resolution (SR) techniques\nhave been widely applied in UGC. Therefore, an effective BVQA method for both\nUGC and SR scenarios is essential. Temporal inconsistency, referring to\nirregularities between consecutive frames, is relevant to video quality.\nCurrent BVQA approaches typically model temporal relationships in UGC videos\nusing statistics of motion information, but inconsistencies remain unexplored.\nAdditionally, different from temporal inconsistency in UGC videos, such\ninconsistency in SR videos is amplified due to upscaling algorithms. In this\npaper, we introduce the Temporal Inconsistency Guided Blind Video Quality\nAssessment (TINQ) metric, demonstrating that exploring temporal inconsistency\nis crucial for effective BVQA. Since temporal inconsistencies vary between UGC\nand SR videos, they are calculated in different ways. Based on this, a spatial\nmodule highlights inconsistent areas across consecutive frames at coarse and\nfine granularities. In addition, a temporal module aggregates features over\ntime in two stages. The first stage employs a visual memory capacity block to\nadaptively segment the time dimension based on estimated complexity, while the\nsecond stage focuses on selecting key features. The stages work together\nthrough Consistency-aware Fusion Units to regress cross-time-scale video\nquality. Extensive experiments on UGC and SR video quality datasets show that\nour method outperforms existing state-of-the-art BVQA methods. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/Lighting-YXLI/TINQ.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes an approach to describing personality dynamics through\nmathematical modelling of introversion, extroversion, and ambiversion\nprocesses. Introversion is interpreted as a recursive process characterized by\ndeep self-awareness and inner reflection; extroversion is presented as an\niterative process of accumulating and processing external stimuli; and\nambiversion is considered transitivity, integrating the interaction of these\ntwo opposing processes. The developed model is based on principles of complex\nsystems theory, nonlinear dynamics, and synergetics, enabling the perception of\npersonality as an adaptive and multilayered system.\n  The results include analytical equations describing the interaction of\ninternal and external factors. Parameters regulating personality dynamics, such\nas sensitivity coefficients, weighting factors of stimuli, and synergy\nparameters, are also explored.\n  The practical significance of the proposed model lies in its application in\npsychotherapy, education, personnel management, and other areas where it is\nnecessary to consider personality traits and their dynamics. The model provides\nnew opportunities for diagnosing, forecasting, and correcting personality\nchanges, enhancing methods of working with individuals.\n  The findings open some prospects for quantitative personality analysis,\nproviding a theoretical understanding of its structure and dynamics.

As an\neffective approach for DiT acceleration, feature caching methods are designed\nto cache the features of DiT in previous timesteps and reuse them in the next\ntimesteps, allowing us to skip the computation in the next timesteps. However,\non the one hand, aggressively reusing all the features cached in previous\ntimesteps leads to a severe drop in generation quality. On the other hand,\nconservatively caching only the features in the redundant layers or tokens but\nstill computing the important ones successfully preserves the generation\nquality but results in reductions in acceleration ratios. Observing such a\ntradeoff between generation quality and acceleration performance, this paper\nbegins by quantitatively studying the accumulated error from cached features.\nSurprisingly, we find that aggressive caching does not introduce significantly\nmore caching errors in the caching step, and the conservative feature caching\ncan fix the error introduced by aggressive caching. Thereby, we propose a dual\ncaching strategy that adopts aggressive and conservative caching iteratively,\nleading to significant acceleration and high generation quality at the same\ntime. Besides, we further introduce a V-caching strategy for token-wise\nconservative caching, which is compatible with flash attention and requires no\ntraining and calibration data.\n  Our codes have been released in Github: \\textbf{Code:\n\\href{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/DuCa}{\\texttt{\\textcolor{cyan}{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/DuCa}}}}",

    "abstract": "Object manipulation is a common component of everyday tasks, but learning to\nmanipulate objects from high-dimensional observations presents significant\nchallenges. These challenges are heightened in multi-object environments due to\nthe combinatorial complexity of the state space as well as of the desired\nbehaviors. While recent approaches have utilized large-scale offline data to\ntrain models from pixel observations, achieving performance gains through\nscaling, these methods struggle with compositional generalization in unseen\nobject configurations with constrained network and dataset sizes. To address\nthese issues, we propose a novel behavioral cloning (BC) approach that\nleverages object-centric representations and an entity-centric Transformer with\ndiffusion-based optimization, enabling efficient learning from offline image\ndata. Our method first decomposes observations into an object-centric\nrepresentation, which is then processed by our entity-centric Transformer that\ncomputes attention at the object level, simultaneously predicting object\ndynamics and the agent's actions. Combined with the ability of diffusion models\nto capture multi-modal behavior distributions, this results in substantial\nperformance improvements in multi-object tasks and, more importantly, enables\ncompositional generalization. We present BC agents capable of zero-shot\ngeneralization to tasks with novel compositions of objects and goals, including\nlarger numbers of objects than seen during training.

These\nmethods excel on IID and general Non-IID data but perform mediocrely in\nSimpson's Paradox scenarios. Simpson's Paradox refers to the phenomenon that\nthe trend observed on the global dataset disappears or reverses on a subset,\nwhich may lead to the fact that global model obtained through aggregation in FL\ndoes not accurately reflect the distribution of global data.

In addition, to improve the quality of\ncounterfactual samples, we introduce factor decorrelation (FDC) loss to reduce\nthe correlation among features and thus improve the independence of extracted\nfactors.

Through experimentation in a low-speed wind tunnel\n($Re=8,000$), we show that the magnitude of lift fluctuations can be enhanced\nby up to a factor of three compared to the unforced flow when the actuation is\naligned with the natural vortex shedding frequency. Velocity field measurements\nindicate that this is caused by strong streamline bending whereas, at a higher\nforcing frequency, vortex shedding is suppressed.

This approach aims to tackle the dual challenges of\nefficiently navigating complex symbolic representation spaces and leveraging\nboth existing and newly generated knowledge to foster open-ended innovation. By\nenabling LLMs to interact with and expand upon a knowledge library, we\nfacilitate the continuous generation of novel solutions in diverse forms such\nas language, code, and mathematical expressions. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that this method not only enhances the efficiency of searching for\nsymbolic solutions but also supports the ongoing discovery process, akin to\nhuman scientific endeavors. This study represents a first effort in\nconceptualizing the search for symbolic solutions as a lifelong, iterative\nprocess, marking a significant step towards harnessing AI in the perpetual\npursuit of scientific and engineering breakthroughs.

To mitigate this issue, a\nmodified KF with an output constraint is proposed. In this approach, the\ndisturbance treated as an measurement is re-scaled by a constraint factor,\nwhich is determined by the system's rated power, the secondary path gain, and\nthe disturbance power. As a result, the output power of the system, i.e. the\ncontrol signal, is indirectly constrained within the maximum output of the\nsystem, ensuring stability. Simulation results indicate that the proposed\nalgorithm not only achieves rapid suppression of dynamic noise but also\neffectively prevents non-linearity due to output saturation, highlighting its\npractical significance.",

While adversarial training has demonstrated\nremarkable effectiveness in image classification tasks, its suitability for GNN\nmodels has been doubted until a recent advance that shifts the focus from\ntransductive to inductive learning. Still, GNN robustness in the inductive\nsetting is under-explored, and it calls for deeper understanding of GNN\nadversarial training. To this end, we propose a new concept of graph subspace\nenergy (GSE) -- a generalization of graph energy that measures graph stability\n-- of the adjacency matrix, as an indicator of GNN robustness against topology\nperturbations. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of such concept, we\npropose an adversarial training method with the perturbed graphs generated by\nmaximizing the GSE regularization term, referred to as AT-GSE. To deal with the\nlocal and global topology perturbations raised respectively by LRBCD and PRBCD,\nwe employ randomized SVD (RndSVD) and Nystrom low-rank approximation to favor\nthe different aspects of the GSE terms. An extensive set of experiments shows\nthat AT-GSE outperforms consistently the state-of-the-art GNN adversarial\ntraining methods over different homophily and heterophily datasets in terms of\nadversarial accuracy, whilst more surprisingly achieving a superior clean\naccuracy on non-perturbed graphs.",

Current state-of-the-art solutions primarily encode image\nfeatures from each camera view into the BEV space through explicit or implicit\ndepth prediction. However, these methods often overlook the structured\ncorrelations among different parts of objects in 3D space and the fact that\ndifferent categories of objects often occupy distinct local height ranges. For\nexample, trucks appear at higher elevations, whereas traffic cones are near the\nground.

Additionally,\ninstead of relying on uniform sampling within a fixed height range, we\nintroduce a height-aware module that incorporates historical information,\nenabling the reference points to adaptively focus on the varying heights at\nwhich objects appear in different scenes.

However, evaluating multimodality is challenging\nsince the task is ill-posed. Therefore, we first propose an alternative\nparadigm to make the task well-posed. Next, while state-of-the-art methods\npredict multimodality, this requires oversampling a large volume of\npredictions. This raises key questions: (1) Can we capture multimodality by\nefficiently sampling a smaller number of predictions? (2) Subsequently, which\nof the predicted futures is more likely for an observed pose sequence? We\naddress these questions with MotionMap, a simple yet effective heatmap based\nrepresentation for multimodality. We extend heatmaps to represent a spatial\ndistribution over the space of all possible motions, where different local\nmaxima correspond to different forecasts for a given observation. MotionMap can\ncapture a variable number of modes per observation and provide confidence\nmeasures for different modes. Further, MotionMap allows us to introduce the\nnotion of uncertainty and controllability over the forecasted pose sequence.\nFinally, MotionMap captures rare modes that are non-trivial to evaluate yet\ncritical for safety. We support our claims through multiple qualitative and\nquantitative experiments using popular 3D human pose datasets: Human3.6M and\nAMASS, highlighting the strengths and limitations of our proposed method.\nProject Page: https://vita-epfl.github.io/MotionMap",

This limitation makes such methods less effective in\nscenarios where constraints exist, such as hooks already occupied by other mugs\nor when specific operational objectives must be met. Moreover, due to the\nfrequent physical interactions between the mug and the rack in real-world\nhanging scenarios, imprecisely generated target states from end-to-end models\noften result in overlapping point clouds.

To address these challenges, we\npropose a Linguistically Guided Hybrid Gaussian Diffusion (LHGD) network for\ngenerating manipulation target states, combined with a gravity coverage\ncoefficient-based method for target state refinement. To evaluate our approach\nunder a language-specified distribution setting, we collected multiple feasible\ntarget states for 10 types of mugs across 5 different racks with 10 distinct\nhooks. Additionally, we prepared five unseen mug designs for validation\npurposes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest\nsuccess rates across single-mode, multi-mode, and language-specified\ndistribution manipulation tasks. Furthermore, it significantly reduces point\ncloud overlap, directly producing collision-free target states and eliminating\nthe need for additional obstacle avoidance operations by the robotic arm.",

This development\nhas led to numerous studies focused on designing advanced systems through\npowerful deep learning techniques. Nevertheless, many of these approaches\nenvision an analog transmission manner by formulating the transmitted signals\nas continuous-valued semantic representation vectors, limiting their\ncompatibility with existing digital systems. To enhance compatibility, it is\nessential to explore digitized SC systems. This article systematically\nidentifies two promising paradigms for designing digital SC: probabilistic and\ndeterministic approaches, according to the modulation strategies. For both, we\nfirst provide a comprehensive analysis of the methodologies. Then, we put\nforward the principles of designing digital SC systems with a specific focus on\ninformativeness and robustness of semantic representations to enhance\nperformance, along with constellation design. Additionally, we present a case\nstudy to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods. Moreover, this article\nalso explores the intrinsic advantages and opportunities provided by digital SC\nsystems, and then outlines several potential research directions for future\ninvestigation.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies showed that topologically trivial insulators may have\nfractionally quantized corner charges due to the topological invariant called a\nfilling anomaly. Such crystal shapes in three dimensions are restricted to\nvertex-transitive polyhedra, which are classified into spherical and\ncylindrical families. The previous works derived formulas of the fractional\ncorner charge for the spherical family, which corresponds to the tetrahedral\nand cubic space groups (SGs). In this study, we derive all the corner charge\nformulas for the cylindrical family, which corresponds to the orthorhombic,\ntetragonal, hexagonal, and trigonal crystal shapes. We show that all the\nreal-space formulas of the filling anomaly for the cylindrical SGs are\nuniversally determined by the total charges at the Wyckoff position (WP) 1a.\nMoreover, we derive the k-space formulas of the corner charge for the\ncylindrical cases with time-reversal symmetry (TRS). From our results, we also\nshow that CsLi$_{2}$Cl_{3}, KN_{3}, and Li_{3}N are candidate materials with a\nquantized corner charge by using the ab initio calculations. Together with our\nprevious work, we exhaust corner charge formulas for all the SGs and crystal\nshapes having quantized corner charges.",

Many applications\nin AD systems necessitate high-quality training datasets using both existing\ndatasets and newly collected data. In this paper, we propose a traffic scene\njoint active learning (TSceneJAL) framework that can efficiently sample the\nbalanced, diverse, and complex traffic scenes from both labeled and unlabeled\ndata. The novelty of this framework is threefold: 1) a scene sampling scheme\nbased on a category entropy, to identify scenes containing multiple object\nclasses, thus mitigating class imbalance for the active learner; 2) a\nsimilarity sampling scheme, estimated through the directed graph representation\nand a marginalize kernel algorithm, to pick sparse and diverse scenes; 3) an\nuncertainty sampling scheme, predicted by a mixture density network, to select\ninstances with the most unclear or complex regression outcomes for the learner.\nFinally, the integration of these three schemes in a joint selection strategy\nyields an optimal and valuable subdataset. Experiments on the KITTI, Lyft,\nnuScenes and SUScape datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art methods on 3D object detection tasks with up to 12%\nimprovements.",

Any inaccuracies in these estimations can distort the ellipsoid's\nconfiguration, potentially compromising the accuracy of the manipulability\nassessment.

Nevertheless,\nthe employment of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) beyond visual line of sight\n(BVLOS) is an endearing task that promises to enhance significantly today's\nlogistics and emergency response capabilities. To tackle these challenges, we\npresent a probabilistic and neuro-symbolic architecture to encode legal\nframeworks and expert knowledge over uncertain spatial relations and noisy\nperception in an interpretable and adaptable fashion.

As a\nresult, ProMis generates Probabilistic Mission Landscapes (PML), which quantify\nthe agent's belief that a set of mission conditions is satisfied across its\nnavigation space. Extending prior work on ProMis' reasoning capabilities and\ncomputational characteristics, we show its integration with potent machine\nlearning models such as Large Language Models (LLM) and Transformer-based\nvision models.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene\nreconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially\nunder adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by\nadverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them,\nlargely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this\nchallenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing\nclear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions.\nSpecifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the\ndense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in\nwhich the former are caused by snowflakes and raindrops in the air, and the\nlatter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we\npropose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the\ndense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the\nrelatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally,\nwe train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for\nexcluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by\nGaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to\nfacilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios.\nExtensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS\nconsistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather\nscenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

However,\nrecent large-scale analyses have revealed a critical limitation: that the\ndiagnostic capability suffers significantly when validated on images captured\nin environments (domains) differing from those used during training. This\nshortfall stems from the inherently limited dataset size and the diverse\nmanifestation of disease symptoms, combined with substantial variations in\ncultivation environments and imaging conditions, such as equipment and\ncomposition. These factors lead to insufficient variety in training data,\nultimately constraining the system's robustness and generalization. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Few-shot Metric Domain Adaptation (FMDA), a\nflexible and effective approach for enhancing diagnostic accuracy in practical\nsystems, even when only limited target data is available. FMDA reduces domain\ndiscrepancies by introducing a constraint to the diagnostic model that\nminimizes the \"distance\" between feature spaces of source (training) data and\ntarget data with limited samples. FMDA is computationally efficient, requiring\nonly basic feature distance calculations and backpropagation, and can be\nseamlessly integrated into any machine learning (ML) pipeline. In large-scale\nexperiments, involving 223,015 leaf images across 20 fields and 3 crop species,\nFMDA achieved F1 score improvements of 11.1 to 29.3 points compared to cases\nwithout target data, using only 10 images per disease from the target domain.\nMoreover, FMDA consistently outperformed fine-tuning methods utilizing the same\ndata, with an average improvement of 8.5 points.",

    "abstract": "Given a graph pair $(G^1, G^2)$, graph edit distance (GED) is defined as the\nminimum number of edit operations converting $G^1$ to $G^2$. GED is a\nfundamental operation widely used in many applications, but its exact\ncomputation is NP-hard, so the approximation of GED has gained a lot of\nattention. Data-driven learning-based methods have been found to provide\nsuperior results compared to classical approximate algorithms, but they\ndirectly fit the coupling relationship between a pair of vertices from their\nvertex features. We argue that while pairwise vertex features can capture the\ncoupling cost (discrepancy) of a pair of vertices, the vertex coupling matrix\nshould be derived from the vertex-pair cost matrix through a more\nwell-established method that is aware of the global context of the graph pair,\nsuch as optimal transport. In this paper, we propose an ensemble approach that\nintegrates a supervised learning-based method and an unsupervised method, both\nbased on optimal transport. Our learning method, GEDIOT, is based on inverse\noptimal transport that leverages a learnable Sinkhorn algorithm to generate the\ncoupling matrix. Our unsupervised method, GEDGW, models GED computation as a\nlinear combination of optimal transport and its variant, Gromov-Wasserstein\ndiscrepancy, for node and edge operations, respectively, which can be solved\nefficiently without needing the ground truth. Our ensemble method, GEDHOT,\ncombines GEDIOT and GEDGW to further boost the performance.

    "abstract": "Intelligent omni-surface (IOS) is a promising technique to enhance the\ncapacity of wireless networks, by reflecting and refracting the incident signal\nsimultaneously. Traditional IOS configuration schemes, relying on all\nsub-channels' channel state information and user equipments' mobility, are\ndifficult to implement in complex realistic systems. Existing works attempt to\naddress this issue employing deep reinforcement learning (DRL), but this method\nrequires a lot of trial-and-error interactions with the external environment\nfor efficient results and thus cannot satisfy the real-time decision-making. To\nenable model-free and real-time IOS control, this paper puts forth a new\nframework that integrates DRL and digital twins. DeepIOS, a DRL based IOS\nconfiguration scheme with the goal of maximizing the sum data rate, is first\ndeveloped to jointly optimize the phase-shift and amplitude of IOS in\nmulti-user multiple-input-multiple-output systems. Thereafter, to further\nreduce the computational complexity, DeepIOS introduces an action branch\narchitecture, which separately decides two optimization variables in parallel.\nFinally, a digital twin module is constructed through supervised learning as a\npre-verification platform for DeepIOS, such that the decision-making's\nreal-time can be guaranteed. The formulated framework is a closed-loop system,\nin which the physical space provides data to establish and calibrate the\ndigital space, while the digital space generates experience samples for DeepIOS\ntraining and sends the trained parameters to the IOS controller for\nconfigurations. Numerical results show that compared with random and MAB\nschemes, the proposed framework attains a higher data rate and is more robust\nto different settings. Furthermore, the action branch architecture reduces\nDeepIOS's computational complexity, and the digital twin module improves the\nconvergence speed and run-time.",

The swirling-Kerr black hole has an\nextra swirling parameter, which characterizes the rotation of universe\nbackground. Our findings indicate that this swirling parameter leads to a delay\nphase shift in the gravitational waveforms. The impact of the swirling\nparameter on EMRI gravitational waves is suppressed by the black hole's spin\nparameter. As a result, extracting information about the swirling parameter\nfrom gravitational waves in a static black hole spacetime is much easier than\nin the case of a rapidly rotating black hole. Our analysis also shows that a\nhigh black hole spin leads to a greater overlap of gravitational waveforms for\ndifferent swirling parameters. We further investigate the potential issue of\nwaveform confusion caused by the orbital eccentricity and semi-latus rectum\nparameters. As the swirling parameter increases, the relative variation in\neccentricity also increases, while the variation in the semi-latus rectum\ndecreases rapidly.

This\nbehavior suggests that integrating diverse visual cues can improve\ngeo-localization reliability. Therefore, we propose a novel task: Cross-View\nImage Set Geo-Localization (Set-CVGL), which gathers multiple images with\ndiverse perspectives as a query set for localization.

To address these needs and\nlimitations, we propose SWAG (Surgical Workflow Anticipative Generation), a\nframework that combines phase recognition and anticipation using a generative\napproach. This paper investigates two distinct decoding methods - single-pass\n(SP) and auto-regressive (AR) - to generate sequences of future surgical phases\nat minute intervals over long horizons.

In this paper, we introduce a modified implicit factorized transformer\n(IFactFormer-m) model which replaces the original chained factorized attention\nwith parallel factorized attention. The IFactFormer-m model successfully\nperforms long-term predictions for turbulent channel flow, whereas the original\nIFactFormer (IFactFormer-o), Fourier neural operator (FNO), and implicit\nFourier neural operator (IFNO) exhibit a poor performance. Turbulent channel\nflows are simulated by direct numerical simulation using fine grids at friction\nReynolds numbers $\\text{Re}_{\\tau}\\approx 180,395,590$, and filtered to coarse\ngrids for training neural operator. The neural operator takes the current flow\nfield as input and predicts the flow field at the next time step, and long-term\nprediction is achieved in the posterior through an autoregressive approach. The\nresults show that IFactFormer-m, compared to other neural operators and the\ntraditional large eddy simulation (LES) methods including dynamic Smagorinsky\nmodel (DSM) and the wall-adapted local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model, reduces\nprediction errors in the short term, and achieves stable and accurate long-term\nprediction of various statistical properties and flow structures, including the\nenergy spectrum, mean streamwise velocity, root mean square (rms) values of\nfluctuating velocities, Reynolds shear stress, and spatial structures of\ninstantaneous velocity. Moreover, the trained IFactFormer-m is much faster than\ntraditional LES methods. By analyzing the attention kernels, we elucidate the\nreasons why IFactFormer-m converges faster and achieves a stable and accurate\nlong-term prediction compared to IFactFormer-o.

Prior\nresearch efforts have focused on supporting the decisions of placing log\nstatements, such as where/what to log. With the increasing adoption of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) for code-related tasks such as code completion or\ngeneration, automated approaches for generating log statements have gained much\nmomentum. However, the performance of these approaches still has a long way to\ngo. This paper explores enhancing the performance of LLM-based solutions for\nautomated log statement generation by post-training LLMs with a purpose-built\ndataset. Thus the primary contribution is a novel approach called AUCAD, which\nautomatically constructs such a dataset with information extracting from\nlog-related issues. Researchers have long noticed that a significant portion of\nthe issues in the open-source community are related to log statements. However,\ndistilling this portion of data requires manual efforts, which is\nlabor-intensive and costly, rendering it impractical. Utilizing our approach,\nwe automatically extract log-related issues from 1,537 entries of log data\nacross 88 projects and identify 808 code snippets (i.e., methods) with\nretrievable source code both before and after modification of each issue\n(including log statements) to construct a dataset. Each entry in the dataset\nconsists of a data pair representing high-quality and problematic log\nstatements, respectively. With this dataset, we proceed to post-train multiple\nLLMs (primarily from the Llama series) for automated log statement generation.\nBoth human and experimental evaluations indicate that these models\nsignificantly outperform existing LLM-based solutions, thereby validating the\nefficacy of our method for constructing a post-training dataset to enhance\nLLM-based log statement generation.",

Next, the retarded Green's functions and the relatively spectral\nfunctions are evaluated by the resulting interpolants. We systematically\nexplore the performance of this method through a series of toy models and\nrealistic examples, comparing its accuracy and efficiency with other popular\nmethods, such as the maximum entropy method. The benchmark results demonstrate\nthat the new method can accurately reproduce not only continuous but also\ndiscrete spectral functions, irrespective of their positive definiteness. It\nworks well even in the presence of intermediate noise, and outperforms\ntraditional analytic continuation methods in computational speed. We believe\nthat this method should stand out for its robustness against noise, broad\napplicability, high precision, and ultra efficiency, offering a promising\nalternative to the maximum entropy method.",

    "abstract": "Low-latency communication has recently attracted considerable attention owing\nto its potential of enabling delay-sensitive services in next-generation\nindustrial cyber-physical systems. To achieve target average or maximum delay\ngiven random arrivals and time-varying channels, buffer-aware scheduling is\nexpected to play a vital role. Evaluating and optimizing buffer-aware\nscheduling relies on its queueing analysis, while existing tools are not\nsufficiently tractable. Particularly, Markov chain and Monte-Carlo based\napproaches are computationally intensive, while large deviation theory (LDT)\nand extreme value theory (EVT) fail in providing satisfactory accuracy in the\nsmall-queue-length (SQL) regime. To tackle these challenges, a tractable yet\naccurate queueing analysis is presented by judiciously bridging Markovian\nanalysis for the computationally manageable SQL regime and LDT/EVT for\nlarge-queue-length (LQL) regime where approximation error diminishes\nasymptotically. Specifically, we leverage censored Markov chain augmentation to\napproximate the original one in the SQL regime, while a piecewise approach is\nconceived to apply LDT/EVT across various queue-length intervals with different\nscheduling parameters. Furthermore, we derive closed-form bounds on\napproximation errors, validating the rigor and accuracy of our approach. As a\ncase study, the approach is applied to analytically analyze a\nLyapunov-drift-based cross-layer scheduling for wireless transmissions.\nNumerical results demonstrate its potential in balancing accuracy and\ncomplexity.",

However, suboptimal initialization of these factors results in\nincreased fine-tuning costs and reduced performance at target length. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an innovative RoPE-based fine-tuning\nframework that diverges from conventional scaling factors search.

The scaling factors obtained through DCIS can even\nperform effectively without fine-tuning. Further analysis of the search space\nreveals that DCIS achieves twice the search efficiency compared to other\nmethods.

    "abstract": "While Diffusion Models (DM) exhibit remarkable performance across various\nimage generative tasks, they nonetheless reflect the inherent bias presented in\nthe training set. As DMs are now widely used in real-world applications, these\nbiases could perpetuate a distorted worldview and hinder opportunities for\nminority groups. Existing methods on debiasing DMs usually requires model\nre-training with a human-crafted reference dataset or additional classifiers,\nwhich suffer from two major limitations: (1) collecting reference datasets\ncauses expensive annotation cost; (2) the debiasing performance is heavily\nconstrained by the quality of the reference dataset or the additional\nclassifier. To address the above limitations, we propose DebiasDiff, a\nplug-and-play method that learns attribute latent directions in a\nself-discovering manner, thus eliminating the reliance on such reference\ndataset. Specifically, DebiasDiff consists of two parts: a set of attribute\nadapters and a distribution indicator. Each adapter in the set aims to learn an\nattribute latent direction, and is optimized via noise composition through a\nself-discovering process. Then, the distribution indicator is multiplied by the\nset of adapters to guide the generation process towards the prescribed\ndistribution. Our method enables debiasing multiple attributes in DMs\nsimultaneously, while remaining lightweight and easily integrable with other\nDMs, eliminating the need for re-training. Extensive experiments on debiasing\ngender, racial, and their intersectional biases show that our method\noutperforms previous SOTA by a large margin.",

We\nshow how to measure as well as achieve higher-order calibration using access to\n$k$-snapshots, namely examples where each point has $k$ independent conditional\nlabels.

However, existing methods face significant\nchallenges with details missing, limbs distortion and the garment style\ndeviation. To address these issues, we propose a Disentangled Representations\nDiffusion Model (DRDM) to generate photo-realistic images from source portraits\nin specific desired poses and appearances. First, a pose encoder is responsible\nfor encoding pose features into a high-dimensional space to guide the\ngeneration of person images. Second, a body-part subspace decoupling block\n(BSDB) disentangles features from the different body parts of a source figure\nand feeds them to the various layers of the noise prediction block, thereby\nsupplying the network with rich disentangled features for generating a\nrealistic target image. Moreover, during inference, we develop a parsing\nmap-based disentangled classifier-free guided sampling method, which amplifies\nthe conditional signals of texture and pose. Extensive experimental results on\nthe Deepfashion dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in\nachieving pose transfer and appearance control.",

Various protocols, such as\nbroadcasting, multicasting, and geo-casting, are used to disseminate data.\nMulticasting protocols are effective in conserving bandwidth. One such\nprotocol, Bandwidth Efficient Acknowledgment Based Multicasting Protocol\n(BEAM), improves VANET performance by minimizing in-network message\ntransactions, particularly in emergencies. However, BEAM may cause multi-car\ncollisions due to the absence of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. To\naddress this, we propose an algorithm that incorporates clustering, grouping\nvehicles based on predefined metrics like density, velocity, and location.\nClustering controls VANET topology dynamics, enhancing stability and reducing\ncommunication barriers and RSU installation costs. The proposed approach uses\nstatic and mobile agents for communication between vehicles and RSUs. In\nmulticast groups, RSUs manage communication, while cluster heads (CHs) handle\nnon-multicast groups. Agents decide cluster size and select primary and\nsecondary cluster heads based on vehicle speed and connectivity.

    "abstract": "As demand from the film and gaming industries for 3D scenes with target\nstyles grows, the importance of advanced 3D stylization techniques increases.\nHowever, recent methods often struggle to maintain local consistency in color\nand texture throughout stylized scenes, which is essential for maintaining\naesthetic coherence. To solve this problem, this paper introduces ArtNVG, an\ninnovative 3D stylization framework that efficiently generates stylized 3D\nscenes by leveraging reference style images. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS), ArtNVG achieves rapid optimization and rendering while upholding high\nreconstruction quality. Our framework realizes high-quality 3D stylization by\nincorporating two pivotal techniques: Content-Style Separated Control and\nAttention-based Neighboring-View Alignment. Content-Style Separated Control\nuses the CSGO model and the Tile ControlNet to decouple the content and style\ncontrol, reducing risks of information leakage. Concurrently, Attention-based\nNeighboring-View Alignment ensures consistency of local colors and textures\nacross neighboring views, significantly improving visual quality. Extensive\nexperiments validate that ArtNVG surpasses existing methods, delivering\nsuperior results in content preservation, style alignment, and local\nconsistency.",

    "abstract": "We present a rigorously formulated, novel operator-based framework that\nmerges ideas from condensed matter physics, continuum mechanics, and\nquantum-inspired theory to analyze collective virion behavior in complex\nenvironments. By modeling metabolically inert virions, whose main interactions\nare Coulombic and Lennard-Jones, as nodes in a viral lattice linked by\neffective springs, we obtain collective vibrational modes akin to phonons in\nsolids. A coupled, complex-valued displacement field PDE underpins our\napproach, enabling wave mechanics and functional analysis to define key\nobservables, ranging from stress fields and thermodynamic responses to\neffective Hamiltonians. We interpret the apparent stochasticity of virion\nmotion as deterministic chaos arising from rapid transitions among 'viral\nphonon' modes that store and redistribute energy from the host. Short-lived\nlattice states (picoseconds) may thus help sustain infectivity in aerosolized\ndroplets of respiratory virions. Extending our operator framework, we derive an\nuncertainty-like relation coupling a virion's self-stiffness operator with its\nphononic frequency operator, underscoring fundamental limits on specifying\ncapsid rigidity and vibrational response. We also explore transient coherence\neffects, akin to entanglement witness operators, which may expose critical\ncorrelations affecting capsid resilience or genome release. Our approach\ninvites experimental validation via advanced imaging, high-resolution\nspectroscopy, and mechanical perturbations. By integrating aspects of soft\nmatter physics, crystallography, statistical mechanics, and wave-based\nmodeling, this methodology suggests new antiviral strategies targeting specific\nvibrational modes and guides the rational design of virus-based vectors in\ntherapeutic or diagnostic applications.",

ViTs show strong capability for image understanding tasks such as\nobject detection, segmentation, and classification. This is due in part to\ntheir ability to leverage global information from interactions among visual\ntokens. However, the self-attention mechanism in ViTs are limited because they\ndo not allow visual tokens to exchange local or global information with\nneighboring features before computing global attention. This is problematic\nbecause tokens are treated in isolation when attending (matching) to other\ntokens, and valuable spatial relationships are overlooked. This isolation is\nfurther compounded by dot-product similarity operations that make tokens from\ndifferent semantic classes appear visually similar. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce two modifications to the traditional self-attention\nframework; a novel aggressive convolution pooling strategy for local feature\nmixing, and a new conceptual attention transformation to facilitate interaction\nand feature exchange between semantic concepts. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that local and global information exchange among visual features\nbefore self-attention significantly improves performance on challenging object\ndetection tasks and generalizes across multiple benchmark datasets and\nchallenging medical datasets.

Using numerical\nsimulations based on the Thiele-Langevin equation, we demonstrate that the\nskyrmion motion cannot be fully described by the master equation, highlighting\nthe system's simplicity with its nontrivial dynamics. Particularly, due to the\nchiral motion of skyrmion, we find asymmetric flow of information even in\nequilibrium, which is demonstrated by the violation of the detailed balance\ncondition. We analyze this novel system using information-theoretical\nquantities including Shannon entropy, mutual information, and transfer entropy.\nBy the analyses, the physical significance of transfer entropy as a measure of\nflow of information, which has been overlooked in previous studies, is\nelucidated. Notably, the peak position of the transfer entropy, as a function\nof time delay, is found to be independent of the interaction range between the\ntwo skyrmions yet dependent on the box size. This peak corresponds to the\ncharacteristic time required for changing the skyrmion state: the box size\ndivided by the average velocity of skyrmions. We can understand that the\ninformation transmission time consists of the time to obtain mutual information\nand the time to write the information. Since the unusual asymmetric circulation\nof information is revealed in this two-skyrmion system, it can be a unique\nplatform for future applications to natural computing using flow of\ninformation, including more efficient machine learning algorithm.",

Less attention has been paid to the robustness\nof these models. It is critical to assess the out-of-distribution (OOD)\ngeneralization of generative IR models, i.e., how would such models generalize\nto new distributions? To answer this question, we focus on OOD scenarios from\nfour perspectives in retrieval problems: (i)query variations; (ii)unseen query\ntypes; (iii)unseen tasks; and (iv)corpus expansion. Based on this taxonomy, we\nconduct empirical studies to analyze the OOD robustness of representative\ngenerative IR models against dense retrieval models. Our empirical results\nindicate that the OOD robustness of generative IR models is in need of\nimprovement. By inspecting the OOD robustness of generative IR models we aim to\ncontribute to the development of more reliable IR models. The code is available\nat \\url{https://github.com/Davion-Liu/GR_OOD}.",

I combine Helmholtz's \"Perception as Unconscious Inference\" --\nparalleled by modern generative models like variational autoencoders (VAE) --\nwith the hierarchical structure of the visual cortex. This combination leads to\nthe development of a hierarchical VAE model, which I test for its ability to\nmimic neurons from the primate visual cortex in response to motion stimuli.\nResults show that the hierarchical VAE perceives motion similar to the primate\nbrain. Additionally, the model identifies causal factors of retinal motion\ninputs, such as object- and self-motion, in a completely unsupervised manner.\nCollectively, these results suggest that hierarchical inference underlines the\nbrain's understanding of the world, and hierarchical VAEs can effectively model\nthis understanding.\n  Project #2 (Chapter 5) investigates the spatiotemporal structure of\nspontaneous brain activity and its reflection of brain states like rest. Using\nsimultaneous fMRI and wide-field Ca2+ imaging data, this project demonstrates\nthat the mouse cortex can be decomposed into overlapping communities, with\naround half of the cortical regions belonging to multiple communities.\nComparisons reveal similarities and differences between networks inferred from\nfMRI and Ca2+ signals.\n  The introduction (Chapter 1) is divided similarly to this abstract: sections\n1.1 to 1.8 provide background information about Project #1, and sections 1.9 to\n1.13 are related to Project #2.

Prior graph-based\napproaches have aimed to capture these dynamics by modeling the group as a\nsingle topological structure. However, these methods struggle to generalize\nacross diverse group compositions, as they fail to fully represent the\nmultifaceted relationships within the group.\n  In this study, we introduce a Hierarchical Multi-Graphs Learning (HMGL)\nframework to address these challenges. Our approach models the group as a\ncollection of multi-relational graphs, leveraging both explicit features (such\nas occlusion, appearance, and foreground information) and implicit dependencies\nbetween members. This hierarchical representation, encoded via a Multi-Graphs\nNeural Network (MGNN), allows us to resolve ambiguities in member\nrelationships, particularly in complex, densely populated scenes. To further\nenhance matching accuracy, we propose a Multi-Scale Matching (MSM) algorithm,\nwhich mitigates issues of member information ambiguity and sensitivity to hard\nsamples, improving robustness in challenging scenarios.\n  Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks,\nCSG and RoadGroup, with Rank-1/mAP scores of 95.3%/94.4% and 93.9%/95.4%,\nrespectively.

Applying\nthis bijection, we prove that a certain operation on dg categories, called the\n$a$-Segre product, allows us to reproduce Calabi-Yau dg categories.\nFurthermore, we discuss the cluster category of these Calabi-Yau completions,\nand prove that it is a $\\mathbb{Z}/a\\mathbb{Z}$-quotient of the usual cluster\ncategory, which thereby establishes the $a$-th root versions of cluster\ncategories. In the appendix, we give a generalization of Beilinson's theorem on\ntilting bundles on projective spaces to the setting of Adams graded dg\ncategories.",

This study investigates how input order and context size influence LLM\nperformance in FL, a crucial step for many downstream software engineering\ntasks. We evaluate different method orderings using Kendall Tau distances,\nincluding \"perfect\" (where ground truths appear first) and \"worst\" (where\nground truths appear last), across two benchmarks containing Java and Python\nprojects. Our results reveal a strong order bias: in Java projects, Top-1 FL\naccuracy drops from 57% to 20% when reversing the order, while in Python\nprojects, it decreases from 38% to approximately 3%. However, segmenting inputs\ninto smaller contexts mitigates this bias, reducing the performance gap in FL\nfrom 22% and 6% to just 1% across both benchmarks. We replaced method names\nwith semantically meaningful alternatives to determine whether this bias is due\nto data leakage. The observed trends remained consistent, suggesting that the\nbias is not caused by memorization from training data but rather by the\ninherent effect of input order. Additionally, we explored ordering methods\nbased on traditional FL techniques and metrics, finding that DepGraph's ranking\nachieves 48% Top-1 accuracy, outperforming simpler approaches such as\nCallGraph(DFS). These findings highlight the importance of structuring inputs,\nmanaging context effectively, and selecting appropriate ordering strategies to\nenhance LLM performance in FL and other software engineering applications.",

Recent research focuses on modeling multimodal\ncontext to enhance prosody expressiveness but overlooks two key issues: 1)\nMultiscale prosody expression attributes in the context influence the current\nsentence's prosody. 2) Prosody cues in context interact with the current\nsentence, impacting the final prosody expressiveness. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose M2CI-Dubber, a Multiscale Multimodal Context Interaction\nscheme for AVD. This scheme includes two shared M2CI encoders to model the\nmultiscale multimodal context and facilitate its deep interaction with the\ncurrent sentence. By extracting global and local features for each modality in\nthe context, utilizing attention-based mechanisms for aggregation and\ninteraction, and employing an interaction-based graph attention network for\nfusion, the proposed approach enhances the prosody expressiveness of\nsynthesized speech for the current sentence.

    "abstract": "Many theoretical models were come up with to figure out the properties of\nmagnetic reconnection process, among which the Sweet-Parker model is the most\nfamous since it describes the magnetic reconnection in a concise way. However,\nthe low reconnection rate expected by this model is generally not available in\nmost astrophysical systems, which motivates people to seek fast reconnection\nmodels. Under the scheme of generalized magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for pair\nplasma, a fast magnetic reconnection model was established, in which the\nthermal electromotive force plays a key role to remarkably increase the\nreconnection rate. In this work, I would like to extend the discussions in my\nprevious work, about the generally relativistic description of Sweet-Parker\nmodel, to the description of fast magnetic reconnection induced by thermal\nelectromotive force. I will revisit the fast reconnection model briefly to\ninitialize my discussions and show how the thermal electromotive force impacts\nthe reconnection rate. Next, some basic setups will be exhibited before\ndiscussing specific examples about how the properties of fast magnetic\nreconnection are modified by gravitational effect or in observations. Results\nin this work consolidate my opinion reiterated in my previous work that\nproperties of magnetic reconnection would never be modified by gravitational\neffect significantly if the magnetic reconnection process occurs in a local\nscale while the modifications of properties could not be neglected when the\nprocess is detected by an observer who is moving with respect to the\nlaboratory, in the rest frame of which the magnetic reconnection occurs.",

To\naddress these challenges, we propose HELPNet, a novel scribble-based weakly\nsupervised segmentation framework, designed to bridge the gap between\nannotation efficiency and segmentation performance. HELPNet integrates three\nmodules. The Hierarchical perturbations consistency (HPC) module enhances\nfeature learning by employing density-controlled jigsaw perturbations across\nglobal, local, and focal views, enabling robust modeling of multi-scale\nstructural representations. Building on this, the Entropy-guided pseudo-label\n(EGPL) module evaluates the confidence of segmentation predictions using\nentropy, generating high-quality pseudo-labels. Finally, the structural prior\nrefinement (SPR) module incorporates connectivity and bounded priors to enhance\nthe precision and reliability and pseudo-labels. Experimental results on three\npublic datasets ACDC, MSCMRseg, and CHAOS show that HELPNet significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based weakly supervised\nsegmentation and achieves performance comparable to fully supervised methods.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/IPMI-NWU/HELPNet.",

    "abstract": "In chaotic quantum systems the spectral form factor exhibits a universal\nlinear ramp and plateau structure with superimposed erratic oscillations. The\nmean signal and the statistics of the noise can be probed by the moments of the\nspectral form factor, also known as higher-point spectral form factors. We\nidentify saddle points in the SYK model that describe the moments during the\nramp region. Perturbative corrections around the saddle point indicate that SYK\nmimics random matrix statistics for the low order moments, while large\ndeviations for the high order moments arise from fluctuations near the edge of\nthe spectrum. The leading correction scales inversely with the number of random\nparameters in the SYK Hamiltonian and is amplified in a sparsified version of\nthe SYK model, which we study numerically, even in regimes where a linear ramp\npersists. Finally, we study the $q=2$ SYK model, whose spectral form factor\nexhibits an exponential ramp with increased noise. These findings reveal how\ndeviations from random matrix universality arise in disordered systems and\nmotivate their interpretation from a bulk gravitational perspective.",

In\nthis work, we revisit the search for gamma-ray subhalo candidates using the\nlatest Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4 catalog. The search is performed by fitting the\nspectral data of unassociated point sources in the catalog through an unbinned\nmaximum likelihood method. We consider two models in the fitting. One is an\nempirical function provided by the catalog, and another is a DM model in which\nDM particles within nearby subhalos annihilate into gamma rays and other\nStandard Model particles. Based on the fitting results, we identify 32\ncandidates for which the maximum likelihood value of the DM model fit exceeds\nthat of the empirical function fit. The estimated J-factors of these candidates\nrange from $0.2$ to $5.8 \\times 10^{20}\\,{\\rm GeV^{2}\\,cm^{-5}}$, the DM\nparticle masses vary from $30$ to $500\\,{\\rm GeV}$ and 12 of them are within\nthe range of $[30, 80]\\,{\\rm GeV}$.

    "abstract": "In recent years, researchers have attempted to exploit social relations to\nimprove the performance in recommendation systems. Generally, most existing\nsocial recommendation methods heavily depends on substantial domain knowledge\nand expertise in primary recommendation tasks for designing useful auxiliary\ntasks. Meanwhile, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) recently has received\nconsiderable attention in the field of recommendation, since it can provide\nself-supervision signals in assisting the improvement of target recommendation\nsystems by constructing self-supervised auxiliary tasks from raw data without\nhuman-annotated labels. Despite the great success, these SSL-based social\nrecommendations are insufficient to adaptively balance various self-supervised\nauxiliary tasks, since assigning equal weights on various auxiliary tasks can\nresult in sub-optimal recommendation performance, where different\nself-supervised auxiliary tasks may contribute differently to improving the\nprimary social recommendation across different datasets. To address this issue,\nin this work, we propose Adaptive Self-supervised Learning for Social\nRecommendations (AdasRec) by taking advantage of various self-supervised\nauxiliary tasks. More specifically, an adaptive weighting mechanism is proposed\nto learn adaptive weights for various self-supervised auxiliary tasks, so as to\nbalance the contribution of such self-supervised auxiliary tasks for enhancing\nrepresentation learning in social recommendations. The adaptive weighting\nmechanism is used to assign different weights on auxiliary tasks to achieve an\noverall weighting of the entire auxiliary tasks and ultimately assist the\nprimary recommendation task, achieved by a meta learning optimization problem\nwith an adaptive weighting network.

In contrast to previous methods only using 2D, we propose\na 3D MRI reconstruction method that leverages a regularized 3D diffusion model\ncombined with optimization method. By incorporating diffusion based priors, our\nmethod improves image quality, reduces noise, and enhances the overall fidelity\nof 3D MRI reconstructions. We conduct comprehensive experiments analysis on\nclinical and plant science MRI datasets. To evaluate the algorithm\neffectiveness for under-sampled k-space data, we also demonstrate its\nreconstruction performance with several undersampling patterns, as well as with\nin- and out-of-distribution pre-trained data. In experiments, we show that our\nmethod improves upon tested competitors.",

Photoreforming is a nature-friendly method that only uses solar energy\nto convert plastic waste into green hydrogen (H2) and valuable organic\nproducts. This study shows that a high-entropy oxynitride (HEON) photocatalyst,\nsynthesized by the addition of nitrogen to a Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta-containing\nhigh-entropy oxide (HEO), exhibits a higher potential for the production of H2,\nformic acid and acetic acid from polyethylene terephthalate (PET)\nphotoreforming compared to the relevant HEO. Examination of X-ray absorption\nnear edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure\n(EXAFS) by synchrotron light shows that, in addition to hybridization of 2p\norbitals from oxygen and nitrogen, nitrogen atoms distort the structure and\ncompletely change the neighborhood of niobium and titanium (a main contributor\nto the conduction band), expands the atomic bonds of zirconium and tantalum,\ncontracts the atomic bonds of hafnium and decreases the binding energy of\ntitanium, niobium and tantalum. These electronic structure changes lead to a\nnarrower bandgap and diminished electron-hole recombination, enhancing the\nphotoreforming performance. This study introduces HEONs with distorted atomic\nbond structures as efficient low-bandgap and stable catalysts for transforming\nplastics into high-value organic chemicals and H2 by photocatalysis.",

    "abstract": "How can we effectively and efficiently learn node representations in signed\nbipartite graphs? A signed bipartite graph is a graph consisting of two nodes\nsets where nodes of different types are positively or negative connected, and\nit has been extensively used to model various real-world relationships such as\ne-commerce, etc. To analyze such a graph, previous studies have focused on\ndesigning methods for learning node representations using graph neural\nnetworks. In particular, these methods insert edges between nodes of the same\ntype based on balance theory, enabling them to leverage augmented structures in\ntheir learning. However, the existing methods rely on a naive message passing\ndesign, which is prone to over-smoothing and susceptible to noisy interactions\nin real-world graphs. Furthermore, they suffer from computational inefficiency\ndue to their heavy design and the significant increase in the number of added\nedges.\n  In this paper, we propose ELISE, an effective and lightweight GNN-based\napproach for learning signed bipartite graphs. We first extend personalized\npropagation to a signed bipartite graph, incorporating signed edges during\nmessage passing. This extension adheres to balance theory without introducing\nadditional edges, mitigating the over-smoothing issue and enhancing\nrepresentation power. We then jointly learn node embeddings on a low-rank\napproximation of the signed bipartite graph, which reduces potential noise and\nemphasizes its global structure, further improving expressiveness without\nsignificant loss of efficiency. We encapsulate these ideas into ELISE,\ndesigning it to be lightweight, unlike the previous methods that add too many\nedges and cause inefficiency. Through extensive experiments on real-world\nsigned bipartite graphs, we demonstrate that ELISE outperforms its competitors\nfor predicting link signs while providing faster training and inference time.",

Consequently, most large classes, particularly in\nscience, rely on objective assessment tools such as multiple-choice quizzes,\nwhich have a single correct answer. The rapid development of AI has introduced\nthe possibility of using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate student\nwriting. An experiment was conducted using GPT-4 to determine if machine\nlearning methods based on LLMs can match or exceed the reliability of\ninstructor grading in evaluating short writing assignments on topics in\nastronomy. The audience consisted of adult learners in three massive open\nonline courses (MOOCs) offered through Coursera. One course was on astronomy,\nthe second was on astrobiology, and the third was on the history and philosophy\nof astronomy. The results should also be applicable to non-science majors in\nuniversity settings, where the content and modes of evaluation are similar. The\ndata comprised answers from 120 students to 12 questions across the three\ncourses. GPT-4 was provided with total grades, model answers, and rubrics from\nan instructor for all three courses. In addition to evaluating how reliably the\nLLM reproduced instructor grades, the LLM was also tasked with generating its\nown rubrics. Overall, the LLM was more reliable than peer grading, both in\naggregate and by individual student, and approximately matched instructor\ngrades for all three online courses. The implication is that LLMs may soon be\nused for automated, reliable, and scalable grading of student science writing.",

In particular, relatively high values of $m_s$ are found for polymers\nhaving complex monomer structures and significant chain stiffness. The\nvariation of $m_s$ with molecular mass, chain stiffness, and intermolecular\ninteraction strength can be traced to the variation of $S_c^*$, which is shown\nto provide a measure of packing frustration defined in terms of the\ndimensionless thermal expansion coefficient and isothermal compressibility.

    "abstract": "Generating sound effects with controllable variations is a challenging task,\ntraditionally addressed using sophisticated physical models that require\nin-depth knowledge of signal processing parameters and algorithms. In the era\nof generative and large language models, text has emerged as a common,\nhuman-interpretable interface for controlling sound synthesis. However, the\ndiscrete and qualitative nature of language tokens makes it difficult to\ncapture subtle timbral variations across different sounds. In this research, we\npropose a novel similarity-based conditioning method for sound synthesis,\nleveraging differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP). This approach\ncombines the use of latent space for learning and controlling audio timbre with\nan intuitive guiding vector, normalized within the range [0,1], to encode\ncategorical acoustic information. By utilizing pre-trained audio representation\nmodels, our method achieves expressive and fine-grained timbre control. To\nbenchmark our approach, we introduce two sound effect datasets--Footstep-set\nand Impact-set--designed to evaluate both controllability and sound quality.\nRegression analysis demonstrates that the proposed similarity score effectively\ncontrols timbre variations and enables creative applications such as timbre\ninterpolation between discrete classes. Our work provides a robust and\nversatile framework for sound effect synthesis, bridging the gap between\ntraditional signal processing and modern machine learning techniques.",
