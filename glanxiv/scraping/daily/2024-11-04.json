    "abstract": "Working memory is a central cognitive ability crucial for intelligent\ndecision-making. Recent experimental and computational work studying working\nmemory has primarily used categorical (i.e., one-hot) inputs, rather than\necologically relevant, multidimensional naturalistic ones. Moreover, studies\nhave primarily investigated working memory during single or few cognitive\ntasks. As a result, an understanding of how naturalistic object information is\nmaintained in working memory in neural networks is still lacking. To bridge\nthis gap, we developed sensory-cognitive models, comprising a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) coupled with a recurrent neural network (RNN), and trained\nthem on nine distinct N-back tasks using naturalistic stimuli. By examining the\nRNN's latent space, we found that: (1) Multi-task RNNs represent both\ntask-relevant and irrelevant information simultaneously while performing tasks;\n(2) The latent subspaces used to maintain specific object properties in vanilla\nRNNs are largely shared across tasks, but highly task-specific in gated RNNs\nsuch as GRU and LSTM; (3) Surprisingly, RNNs embed objects in new\nrepresentational spaces in which individual object features are less\northogonalized relative to the perceptual space; (4) The transformation of\nworking memory encodings (i.e., embedding of visual inputs in the RNN latent\nspace) into memory was shared across stimuli, yet the transformations governing\nthe retention of a memory in the face of incoming distractor stimuli were\ndistinct across time. Our findings indicate that goal-driven RNNs employ\nchronological memory subspaces to track information over short time spans,\nenabling testable predictions with neural data.",

Hence, we do not\ngenerally know whether $\\mathsf{QMA}_1^G=\\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G'}$ (superscript\ndenoting gateset), given two universal gatesets $G,G'$. In this paper, we make\nprogress towards the gateset question by proving that for all $k\\in\\mathbb N$,\nthe gateset $G_{2^k}$ (Amy et al., RC 2024) is universal for all gatesets in\nthe cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{2^k}),\\zeta_{2^k}=e^{2\\pi i/2^k}$, i.e.\n$\\mathsf{QMA}_1^G\\subseteq\\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$ for all gatesets $G$ in\n$\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{2^k})$.

We focus on unconventional magnets known as\n$d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. We find that the Andreev bound\nstates in $d$-wave altermagnet and $p_y$-wave magnet Josephson junctions\nstrongly depend on the transverse momentum, with a spin splitting and\nlow-energy minima as a function of the superconducting phase difference\n$\\varphi$. In contrast, the Andreev bound states for $p_{x}$-wave magnets are\ninsensitive to the transverse momentum. We show that the Andreev bound states\ncan be probed by the local density of states in the middle of the junction,\nwhich also reveals that $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- and $p$-wave magnet junctions are\nprone to host zero energy peaks. While the zero-energy peak in\n$d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnet junctions tends to oscillate with the\nmagnetic order, it remains robust in $p$-wave magnet junctions. We also\ndemonstrate that the critical currents in $d$-wave altermagnet Josephson\njunctions exhibit an oscillatory decay with the increase of the magnetic order,\nwhile the oscillations are absent in $p$-wave magnet junctions albeit the\ncurrents exhibit a slow decay. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the\ninterplay of the Josephson effect and unconventional magnetic order of $d$-wave\naltermagnets and $p$-wave magnets originates from odd-frequency spin-triplet\n$s$-wave superconducting correlations that are otherwise absent.

A robust intrusion\ndetection system (IDS) can essentially mitigate threats by providing alerts.

In order to detect these threats various machine learning (ML) and deep\nlearning (DL) models have been proposed.

Previous\napproaches augment image-text pairs to enhance diversity within the adversarial\nexample generation process, aiming to improve transferability by expanding the\ncontrast space of image-text features. However, these methods focus solely on\ndiversity around the current AEs, yielding limited gains in transferability. To\naddress this issue, we propose to increase the diversity of AEs by leveraging\nthe intersection regions along the adversarial trajectory during optimization.\nSpecifically, we propose sampling from adversarial evolution triangles composed\nof clean, historical, and current adversarial examples to enhance adversarial\ndiversity. We provide a theoretical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed adversarial evolution triangle. Moreover, we find that\nredundant inactive dimensions can dominate similarity calculations, distorting\nfeature matching and making AEs model-dependent with reduced transferability.\nHence, we propose to generate AEs in the semantic image-text feature contrast\nspace, which can project the original feature space into a semantic corpus\nsubspace. The proposed semantic-aligned subspace can reduce the image feature\nredundancy, thereby improving adversarial transferability. Extensive\nexperiments across different datasets and models demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod can effectively improve adversarial transferability and outperform\nstate-of-the-art adversarial attack methods.

    "abstract": "Accurate time series analysis is essential for studying variable astronomical\nsources, where detecting periodicities and characterizing power spectral\ndensity (PSD) are crucial. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram, commonly used in\nastronomy for analyzing unevenly sampled time series data, often suffers from\nnoise introduced by irregular sampling. This paper presents a new high-pass\nfilter (HPF) periodogram, a novel implementation designed to mitigate this\nsampling-induced noise. By applying a frequency-dependent high-pass filter\nbefore computing the periodogram, the HPF method enhances the precision of PSD\nestimates and periodicity detection across a wide range of signal\ncharacteristics. Simulations and comparisons with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram\ndemonstrate that the HPF periodogram improves accuracy and reliability under\nchallenging sampling conditions, making it a valuable complementary tool for\nmore robust time series analysis in astronomy and other fields dealing with\nunevenly sampled data.",

We\nreport on analysis of the X-ray binary 1eRASS J085039.9-421151, using a ~55\\,ks\nlong NuSTAR observation, following its detection in each eROSITA scan. Analysis\nof the eROSITA and NuSTAR X-ray spectra in combination with X-shooter data of\nthe optical counterpart provide evidence of an X-ray binary with a red\nsupergiant (RSG) companion, confirming previous results, although we determine\na cooler spectral type of M2-3, owing to the presence of TiO bands in the\noptical and near infrared spectra. The X-ray spectrum is well-described by an\nabsorbed power law with a high energy cutoff typically applied for accreting\nhigh mass X-ray binaries. In addition, we detect a strong fluorescent neutral\niron line with an equivalent width of ~700\\,eV and an absorption edge, the\nlatter indicating strong absorption by a partial covering component. It is\nunclear if the partial absorber is ionised. There is no significant evidence of\na cyclotron resonant scattering feature. We do not detect any pulsations in the\nNuSTAR lightcurves, possibly on account of a large spin period that goes\nundetected due to insufficient statistics at low frequencies or potentially\nlarge absorption that causes pulsations to be smeared out. Even so, the low\npersistent luminosity, the spectral parameters observed (photon index,\n$\\Gamma<1.0$), and the minuscule likelihood of detection of RSG-black hole\nsystems, suggest that the compact object is a neutron star.",

Key features of the tool include (i)\nmodular design, (ii) multiple transportation modes, (iii) capabilities for\nextension, and (iv) testing against various system components and networks of\nsmall and large sizes. Five matching algorithms for CO2 supply agents (e.g.,\npowerplants and industrial facilities) and demand agents (e.g., storage and\nutilization sites) are explored: Most Profitable First Year (MPFY), Most\nProfitable All Years (MPAY), Shortest Total Distance First Year (SDFY),\nShortest Total Distance All Years (SDAY), and Shortest distance to long-haul\ntransport All Years (ACAY). Before matching, the supply agent, demand agent,\nand route must be available, and the connection must be profitable. A\nprofitable connection means the supply agent portion of revenue from the 45Q\ntax credit must cover the supply agent costs and all transportation costs,\nwhile the demand agent revenue portion must cover all demand agent costs. A\ncase study employing over 5,500 supply and demand agents and multimodal CCUS\ntransportation infrastructure in the contiguous United States is conducted. The\nresults suggest that it is possible to capture over 9 billion tonnes (GT) of\nCO2 from 2025 to 2043, which will increase significantly to 22 GT if the\ncapture costs are reduced by 40%.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder\ncharacterized by the progressive accumulation of misfolded proteins, leading to\ncognitive decline. This study presents a novel stochastic modelling approach to\nsimulate the propagation of these proteins within the brain. We employ a\nnetwork diffusion model utilizing the Laplacian matrix derived from MRI data\nprovided by the Human Connectome Project (https://braingraph.org/cms/). The\ndeterministic model is extended by incorporating stochastic differential\nequations (SDEs) to account for inherent uncertainties in disease progression.\nIntroducing stochastic components into the model allows for a more realistic\nsimulation of the disease due to the multi-factorial nature of AD. By\nsimulation, the model captures the variability in misfolded protein\nconcentration across brain regions over time. Bayesian inference is a\nstatistical method that uses prior beliefs and given data to model a posterior\ndistribution for relevant parameter values. This allows us to better understand\nthe impact of noise and external factors on AD progression. Deterministic\nresults suggest that AD progresses at different speeds within each lobe of the\nbrain, moreover, the frontal takes the longest to reach a perfect disease\nstate. We find that in the presence of noise, the model never reaches a perfect\ndisease state and the later years of AD are more unpredictable than earlier on\nin the disease.

    "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations can be used to interpret and debug text\nclassifiers by producing minimally altered text inputs that change a\nclassifier's output. In this work, we evaluate five methods for generating\ncounterfactual explanations for a BERT text classifier on two datasets using\nthree evaluation metrics. The results of our experiments suggest that\nestablished white-box substitution-based methods are effective at generating\nvalid counterfactuals that change the classifier's output. In contrast, newer\nmethods based on large language models (LLMs) excel at producing natural and\nlinguistically plausible text counterfactuals but often fail to generate valid\ncounterfactuals that alter the classifier's output. Based on these results, we\nrecommend developing new counterfactual explanation methods that combine the\nstrengths of established gradient-based approaches and newer LLM-based\ntechniques to generate high-quality, valid, and plausible text counterfactual\nexplanations.",

In this work, we\ndefine a variant of the Berezin quantization map, which acts on the classical\nWeyl algebra $\\mathcal{W}(E,0)$ and constitutes a positive \\textit{strict\ndeformation quantization}. This construction provides a natural framework to\ncompare classical and quantum thermal equilibrium states of a Bose gas through\nthe computation of their semi-classical limit.\n  To this end, we first introduce a purely algebraic notion of KMS states for\nthe classical Weyl algebra and establish that, in finite volume, there exists a\nunique such state, which can be interpreted as the Fourier transform of a Gibbs\nmeasure on a Hilbert space. We then construct a new class of classical KMS\nstates that realize representations of the canonical commutation relations with\ninfinite local density. These states arise as the semi-classical high-density\nlimit of the quantum equilibrium states originally studied by Araki and Woods\n\\cite{Araki_Woods_63}.

These bounds constrain the coupling\nstrength of many proposed ultralight bosonic dark-matter candidates. Recently,\nit was pointed out that a monopole-dipole coupling between the Sun and the\nspin-polarized electrons of Earth would result in a modification of the\nprecession of the perihelion of Earth. Using an estimate for the net\nspin-polarization of Earth and experimental bounds on Earth's perihelion\nprecession, interesting constraints were placed on the magnitude of this\nmonopole-dipole coupling. Here we investigate the spin associated with Earth's\nelectrons. We find that there are about $6 \\times 10^{41}$ spin-polarized\nelectrons in the mantle and crust of Earth oriented anti-parallel to their\nlocal magnetic field. However, when integrated over any spherically-symmetric\nEarth model, we find that the vector sum of these spins is zero. In order to\nestablish a lower bound on the magnitude of the net spin along Earth's rotation\naxis we have investigated three of the largest breakdowns of Earth's spherical\nsymmetry: the large low shear-velocity provinces of the mantle, the crustal\ncomposition, and the oblate spheroid of Earth. From these investigations we\nconclude that there are at least $5 \\times 10^{38}$ spin-polarized electrons\naligned anti-parallel to Earth's rotation axis. This analysis suggests that the\nbounds on the monopole-dipole coupling that were extracted from Earth's\nperihelion precession need to be relaxed by a factor of about 2000.",

While\nnumerous deep learning approaches have sought to enhance traditional DR grading\nmethods, they often falter when confronted with new out-of-distribution data\nthereby impeding their widespread application. In this study, we introduce a\nnovel deep learning method for achieving domain generalization (DG) in DR\ngrading and make the following contributions. First, we propose a new way of\ngenerating image-to-image diagnostically relevant fundus augmentations\nconditioned on the grade of the original fundus image. These augmentations are\ntailored to emulate the types of shifts in DR datasets thus increase the\nmodel's robustness. Second, we address the limitations of the standard\nclassification loss in DG for DR fundus datasets by proposing a new DG-specific\nloss, domain alignment loss; which ensures that the feature vectors from all\ndomains corresponding to the same class converge onto the same manifold for\nbetter domain generalization. Third, we tackle the coupled problem of data\nimbalance across DR domains and classes by proposing to employ Focal loss which\nseamlessly integrates with our new alignment loss. Fourth, due to inevitable\nobserver variability in DR diagnosis that induces label noise, we propose\nleveraging self-supervised pretraining. This approach ensures that our DG model\nremains robust against early susceptibility to label noise, even when only a\nlimited dataset of non-DR fundus images is available for pretraining.

    "abstract": "We characterise the Schatten class $S^p$ properties of commutators $[b,T]$ of\nsingular integrals and pointwise multipliers in a general framework of\n(quasi-)metric measure spaces. This covers, unifies, and extends a range of\nprevious results in different special cases. As in the classical results on\n$\\mathbb R^d$, the characterisation has three parts: (1) For $p>d$, we have\n$[b,T]\\in S^p$ if and only if $b$ is in a suitable Besov (or fractional\nSobolev) space. (2) For $p\\leq d$, we have $[b,T]\\in S^p$ if and only if $b$ is\nconstant. (3) For $p=d$, we have $[b,T]\\in S^{d,\\infty}$ (a weak-type Schatten\nclass) if and only if $b$ is in a first-order Sobolev space.\n  Result (1) extends to all spaces of homogeneous type as long as there are\nappropriate singular integrals, but for the more delicate properties (2) and\n(3), we assume a complete doubling metric space supporting a suitable\nPoincar\\'e inequality, which is still very general. These latter results depend\non new characterisations of constant functions and Sobolev spaces over such\nspaces obtained in a companion paper of the author with R. Korte.\n  Even when specialised to various concrete domains considered earlier, the\npresent results extend ones available in the literature by covering a larger\nclass of operators with minimal kernel assumptions, removing a-priori\nassumptions on the pointwise multiplier $b$, and allowing Schatten classes on\nthe weighted spaces $L^2(w)$ with an arbitrary Muckenhoupt weight $w\\in A_2$.\nEven on $\\mathbb R^d$, such weighted results were previously known for a few\nspecial operators $T$ only, and on all other domains, they are completely new.",

A custom 3D-printed setup, featuring orthogonal\ncameras, captures biplane video of the catheter, while a specialized computer\nvision algorithm reconstructs its 3D trajectory, localizing the tip with\nsub-millimeter accuracy and tracking the roll angle in real-time.

This immersive environment allows the\ntesting of the importance of 3D depth perception, in comparison to 2D\nprojections, as a form of visualization in XR. Our experimental study,\nconducted using the ICE catheter with six participants, suggests that 3D\nvisualization is not necessarily beneficial over 2D views offered by the XR\nsystem; although all cardiologists saw its utility for pre-operative training,\nplanning, and intra-operative guidance.

However, their interpretations may not be\nstraightforwardly linked to the meanings of their individual components in\nisolation and this may have an impact for compositional approaches. In this\npaper, we investigate to what extent word representation models are able to go\nbeyond compositional word combinations and capture multiword expression\nidiomaticity and some of the expected properties related to idiomatic meanings.\nWe focus on noun compounds of varying levels of idiomaticity in two languages\n(English and Portuguese), presenting a dataset of minimal pairs containing\nhuman idiomaticity judgments for each noun compound at both type and token\nlevels, their paraphrases and their occurrences in naturalistic and\nsense-neutral contexts, totalling 32,200 sentences. We propose this set of\nminimal pairs for evaluating how well a model captures idiomatic meanings, and\ndefine a set of fine-grained metrics of Affinity and Scaled Similarity, to\ndetermine how sensitive the models are to perturbations that may lead to\nchanges in idiomaticity. The results obtained with a variety of representative\nand widely used models indicate that, despite superficial indications to the\ncontrary in the form of high similarities, idiomaticity is not yet accurately\nrepresented in current models. Moreover, the performance of models with\ndifferent levels of contextualisation suggests that their ability to capture\ncontext is not yet able to go beyond more superficial lexical clues provided by\nthe words and to actually incorporate the relevant semantic clues needed for\nidiomaticity.",

To enable such adaptation, we\ndesign lightweight and interpretable learning algorithms that allow users to\nbuild an understanding and co-adapt to a robot's capabilities in real-time, as\nthey teach new behaviors. For example, after demonstrating a new low-level\nskill for \"tracking around\" an object, users are provided with trajectory\nvisualizations of the robot's intended motion when asked to track a new object.\nSimilarly, users teach high-level planning behaviors through spoken dialogue,\nusing pretrained language models to synthesize behaviors such as \"packing an\nobject away\" as compositions of low-level skills $-$ concepts that can be\nreused and built upon. We evaluate Vocal Sandbox in two settings: collaborative\ngift bag assembly and LEGO stop-motion animation. In the first setting, we run\nsystematic ablations and user studies with 8 non-expert participants,\nhighlighting the impact of multi-level teaching. Across 23 hours of total robot\ninteraction time, users teach 17 new high-level behaviors with an average of 16\nnovel low-level skills, requiring 22.1% less active supervision compared to\nbaselines and yielding more complex autonomous performance (+19.7%) with fewer\nfailures (-67.1%).

The framework\nis based on the concept of declarative blockchain transactions whose strength\nlies in the fact that it addresses several of the limitations of smart\ncontracts simultaneously. A formal and implementation framework is presented,\nand a subset of commonly occurring transaction behaviors are modeled and\nimplemented as use cases, using an open-source blockchain database,\nBigchchainDB, as the implementation context. A performance study comparing the\ndeclarative transaction approach to equivalent smart contract transaction\nmodels reveals several advantages of the proposed approach.",

Most traditional techniques of topological data\nanalysis (TDA), such as persistent homology (PH) and persistent Laplacian (PL),\noverlook this aspect in their standard form. To address this, we present the\npersistent directed flag Laplacian (PDFL), which incorporates directed flag\ncomplexes to account for edges with directionality originated from\npolarization, gene regulation, heterogeneous interactions, etc. This study\nmarks the first application of the PDFL, providing an in-depth analysis of\nspectral graph theory combined with machine learning. Besides its superior\naccuracy and reliability, the PDFL model offers simplicity by requiring only\nraw inputs without complex data processing. We validated our multi-kernel PDFL\nmodel for its scoring power against other state-of-art methods on three popular\nbenchmarks, namely PDBbind v2007, v2013, and v2016. Computational results\nindicate that the proposed PDFL model outperforms competitors in protein-ligand\nbinding affinity predictions, indicating that PDFL is a promising tool for\nprotein engineering, drug discovery, and general applications in science and\nengineering.",

In public health, where stakes\nare high and impacts extend across diverse populations, adopting LLMs poses\nunique challenges that require thorough evaluation. However, structured\napproaches for assessing potential risks in public health remain\nunder-explored. To address this gap, we conducted focus groups with public\nhealth professionals and individuals with lived experience to unpack their\nconcerns, situated across three distinct and critical public health issues that\ndemand high-quality information: infectious disease prevention (vaccines),\nchronic and well-being care (opioid use disorder), and community health and\nsafety (intimate partner violence). We synthesize participants' perspectives\ninto a risk taxonomy, identifying and contextualizing the potential harms LLMs\nmay introduce when positioned alongside traditional health communication. This\ntaxonomy highlights four dimensions of risk to individuals, human-centered\ncare, information ecosystem, and technology accountability. For each dimension,\nwe unpack specific risks and offer example reflection questions to help\npractitioners adopt a risk-reflexive approach. By summarizing distinctive LLM\ncharacteristics and linking them to identified risks, we discuss the need to\nrevisit prior mental models of information behaviors and complement evaluations\nwith external validity and domain expertise through lived experience and\nreal-world practices. Together, this work contributes a shared vocabulary and\nreflection tool for people in both computing and public health to\ncollaboratively anticipate, evaluate, and mitigate risks in deciding when to\nemploy LLM capabilities (or not) and how to mitigate harm.",

Effective communication is crucial for daily activities,\nand losing the ability to speak leads to isolation, depression, anxiety, and a\nhost of detrimental sequelae. Noninvasive surface electromyography (sEMG) has\nshown promise to restore speech output in these individuals. The goal is to\ncollect sEMG signals from multiple articulatory sites as people silently\nproduce speech and then decode the signals to enable fluent and natural\ncommunication. Currently, many fundamental properties of orofacial\nneuromuscular signals relating to speech articulation remain unanswered. They\ninclude questions relating to 1) the data structure of the orofacial sEMG\nsignals, 2)the signal distribution shift of sEMG across individuals, 3) ability\nof sEMG signals to span the entire English language phonetic space during\nsilent speech articulations, and 4) the generalization capability of\nnon-invasive sEMG based silent speech interfaces. We address these questions\nthrough a series of experiments involving healthy human subjects. We show that\nsEMG signals evince graph data structure and that the signal distribution shift\nis given by a change of basis. Furthermore, we show that silently voiced\narticulations spanning the entire English language phonetic space can be\ndecoded using small neural networks which can be trained with little data and\nthat such architectures work well across individuals.

As enterprises increasingly accumulate vast amounts of operational\ndata, there is significant potential to leverage this big data to enhance the\nperformance of automated systems.

    "abstract": "Social support, conveyed through a multitude of interactions and platforms\nsuch as social media, plays a pivotal role in fostering a sense of belonging,\naiding resilience in the face of challenges, and enhancing overall well-being.\nThis paper introduces Social Support Detection (SSD) as a Natural language\nprocessing (NLP) task aimed at identifying supportive interactions within\nonline communities. The study presents the task of Social Support Detection\n(SSD) in three subtasks: two binary classification tasks and one multiclass\ntask, with labels detailed in the dataset section. We conducted experiments on\na dataset comprising 10,000 YouTube comments. Traditional machine learning\nmodels were employed, utilizing various feature combinations that encompass\nlinguistic, psycholinguistic, emotional, and sentiment information.\nAdditionally, we experimented with neural network-based models using various\nword embeddings to enhance the performance of our models across these\nsubtasks.The results reveal a prevalence of group-oriented support in online\ndialogues, reflecting broader societal patterns. The findings demonstrate the\neffectiveness of integrating psycholinguistic, emotional, and sentiment\nfeatures with n-grams in detecting social support and distinguishing whether it\nis directed toward an individual or a group. The best results for different\nsubtasks across all experiments range from 0.72 to 0.82.",

Unlike models that\nrely on explicit angular terms or human-engineered features, EOSnet efficiently\nencodes many-body interactions through orbital overlap matrices, providing a\nrotationally invariant and transferable representation of atomic environments.\nThe model demonstrates superior performance across various materials property\nprediction tasks, achieving particularly notable results in properties\nsensitive to many-body interactions. For band gap prediction, EOSnet achieves a\nmean absolute error of 0.163 eV, surpassing previous state-of-the-art models.\nThe model also excels in predicting mechanical properties and classifying\nmaterials, with 97.7\\% accuracy in metal/non-metal classification.

Recent advances have explored using Multiple-Forecast Visualizations\n(MFVs) to display multiple time-series forecasts. However, how to\nsystematically sample from a pool of disparate forecasts to create MFVs that\neffectively facilitate decision-making requires further investigation. To\naddress this challenge, we examine two cluster-based sampling strategies for\ncreating MFVs and three designs for visualizing them to assist people in\ndecision-making with forecasts. Through two online studies (Experiment 1 n =\n711 and Experiment 2 n = 400) and over 15 decision-making-related metrics, we\nevaluated participants' perceptions of eight visualization designs using\nhistorical COVID-19 forecasts as a test bed. Our findings revealed that one\nsampling method significantly enhanced participants' ability to predict future\noutcomes, thereby reducing their surprise when confronted with the actual\noutcomes. Importantly, since no approach excels in all metrics, we advise\nchoosing different visualization designs based on communication goals.\nFurthermore, qualitative response data demonstrate a correlation between\nresponse consistency and people's inclination to extrapolate from the forecast\nsegment of the visualization. This research offers insights into how to improve\nvisualizations of multiple forecasts using an automated and empirically\nvalidated technique for selecting forecasts that outperform common techniques\non several key metrics and reduce overplotting.",

This paper introduces techniques for advancing\ninformation retrieval with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling a\nbroader search scenario, termed universal multimodal retrieval, where multiple\nmodalities and diverse retrieval tasks are accommodated. To this end, we first\nstudy fine-tuning an MLLM as a bi-encoder retriever on 10 datasets with 16\nretrieval tasks. Our empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLM retriever\nis capable of understanding challenging queries, composed of both text and\nimage, but it underperforms compared to a smaller CLIP retriever in cross-modal\nretrieval tasks due to the modality bias exhibited by MLLMs. To address the\nissue, we propose modality-aware hard negative mining to mitigate the modality\nbias exhibited by MLLM retrievers. Second, we propose continuously fine-tuning\nthe universal multimodal retriever to enhance its text retrieval capability\nwhile preserving multimodal retrieval capability. As a result, our model,\nMM-Embed, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multimodal retrieval\nbenchmark M-BEIR, which spans multiple domains and tasks, while also surpassing\nthe state-of-the-art text retrieval model, NV-Embed-v1, on the MTEB retrieval\nbenchmark. We also explore prompting the off-the-shelf MLLMs as zero-shot\nrerankers to refine the ranking of the candidates from the multimodal\nretriever. We find that, through prompt-and-reranking, MLLMs can further\nimprove multimodal retrieval when the user queries (e.g., text-image composed\nqueries) are more complex and challenging to understand. These findings also\npave the way for advancing universal multimodal retrieval in the future.",

To address this\nchallenge, we introduce PipeLLM, a user-transparent runtime system. PipeLLM\nremoves the overhead by overlapping the encryption and GPU computation through\npipelining - an idea inspired by the CPU instruction pipelining - thereby\neffectively concealing the latency increase caused by encryption. The primary\ntechnical challenge is that, unlike CPUs, the encryption module lacks prior\nknowledge of the specific data needing encryption until it is requested by the\nGPUs.

    "abstract": "Instruction tuning constitutes a prevalent technique for tailoring Large\nVision Language Models (LVLMs) to meet individual task requirements. To date,\nmost of the existing approaches are confined to single-task adaptation, whereas\nthe requirements in real-world scenarios are inherently varied and continually\nevolving. Thus an ideal LVLM should sustain continual instruction tuning in the\nface of stream-task distributions (i.e., different domains, emerging\ncapabilities, and new datasets) while minimizing the forgetting of previously\nacquired knowledge. To achieve this, we propose a new benchmark for COntinuAl\ninStruction Tuning on LVLMs (COAST), which encompasses the aforementioned\ndomain-incremental, capability-incremental, and dataset-incremental\nconfigurations. In terms of methodology, we propose Continual LLaVA, a\nrehearsal-free method tailored for continual instruction tuning in LVLMs. To\ncircumvent the additional overhead associated with experience replay, we freeze\nLVLMs and construct the dual increment embeddings for each input instruction to\nfacilitate parameter-efficient tuning. Specifically, the increment embeddings\ncan be decomposed into two principal components: 1) intrinsic increment\nembeddings to encode task-specific characteristics. To achieve this, we set up\na low-rank pool containing candidate embeddings, from which we select the\nrelevant ones based on their similarity with the user instructions; 2)\ncontextual increment embeddings to investigate the inter-dependencies across\ntasks. In this regard, the low-rank embeddings chosen in the previous tasks are\naggregated via learnable weighted sum to provide complementary hints. Extensive\nexperiments indicate that the proposed Continual LLaVA outperforms previous\nmethods by significantly reducing the forgetting during the continual\ninstruction tuning process.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how information can efficiently spread in distributed systems\nunder noisy communications is a fundamental question in both biological\nresearch and artificial system design. When agents are able to control whom\nthey interact with, noise can often be mitigated through redundancy or other\ncoding techniques, but it may have fundamentally different consequences on\nwell-mixed systems. Specifically, Boczkowski et al. (2018) considered the noisy\n$\\mathcal{PULL}(h)$ model, where each message can be viewed as any other\nmessage with probability $\\delta$. The authors proved that in this model, the\nbasic task of propagating a bit value from a single source to the whole\npopulation requires $\\Omega(\\frac{n\\delta}{h(1-\\delta|\\Sigma|)^2})$ (parallel)\nrounds.\n  The current work shows that the aforementioned lower bound is almost tight.\nIn particular, when each agent observes all other agents in each round, which\nrelates to scenarios where each agent senses the system's average tendency,\ninformation spreading can reliably be achieved in $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ time,\nassuming constant noise. We present two simple and highly efficient protocols,\nthus suggesting their applicability to real-life scenarios. Notably, they also\nwork in the presence of multiple conflicting sources and efficiently converge\nto their plurality opinion. The first protocol we present uses 1-bit messages\nbut relies on a simultaneous wake-up assumption. By increasing the message size\nto 2 bits and removing the speedup in the information spreading time that may\nresult from having multiple sources, we also present a simple and highly\nefficient self-stabilizing protocol that avoids the simultaneous wake-up\nrequirement.\n  Overall, our results demonstrate how, under stochastic communication,\nincreasing the sample size can compensate for the lack of communication\nstructure by linearly accelerating information spreading time.",

How can researchers make use of\nsuch data even in the presence of non-ignorable selection mechanisms? A number\nof methods have been developed for this issue, such as distributionally robust\noptimization (DRO) or learning fairness. A possible avenue to reducing the\neffect of bias is meta-information. Researchers, being field exerts, might have\nprior information on the form and extent of selection bias affecting their\ndataset, and in which direction the selection might cause the estimate to\nchange, e.g. over or under estimation.

    "abstract": "Constructing precise 3D maps is crucial for the development of future\nmap-based systems such as self-driving and navigation. However, generating\nthese maps in complex environments, such as multi-level parking garages or\nshopping malls, remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we introduce a\nparticipatory sensing approach that delegates map-building tasks to map users,\nthereby enabling cost-effective and continuous data collection. The proposed\nmethod harnesses the collective efforts of users, facilitating the expansion\nand ongoing update of the maps as the environment evolves.\n  We realized this approach by developing Map++, an efficient system that\nfunctions as a plug-and-play extension, supporting participatory map-building\nbased on existing SLAM algorithms. Map++ addresses a plethora of scalability\nissues in this participatory map-building system by proposing a set of\nlightweight, application-layer protocols. We evaluated Map++ in four\nrepresentative settings: an indoor garage, an outdoor plaza, a public SLAM\nbenchmark, and a simulated environment. The results demonstrate that Map++ can\nreduce traffic volume by approximately 46% with negligible degradation in\nmapping accuracy, i.e., less than 0.03m compared to the baseline system. It can\nsupport approximately $2 \\times$ as many concurrent users as the baseline under\nthe same network bandwidth. Additionally, for users who travel on\nalready-mapped trajectories, they can directly utilize the existing maps for\nlocalization and save 47% of the CPU usage.",

For this purpose, data from a systematic review of crime surveys\nconducted in Germany between 2001--2021 were used. First, a meta-analysis of\nproportions is used to estimate the summary response rate. Second, a\nmeta-regression was fitted, modeling the relationship between the observed\nresponse rates and survey-design features, such as the study year, target\npopulation, coverage area, data collection mode, and institute.

For the open\ntransverse Ising model this leads to a neat organisation of the operator\ndynamics on either side of the duality, both consistent with growth expected in\na quadratic fermion model like the Kitaev chain.

However, this simplified linear\nsetting arguably does not demonstrate the statistical efficiency of ICL, since\nthe pretrained transformer does not outperform directly solving linear\nregression on the test prompt. In this paper, we study ICL of a nonlinear\nfunction class via transformer with nonlinear MLP layer: given a class of\n\\textit{single-index} target functions $f_*(\\boldsymbol{x}) =\n\\sigma_*(\\langle\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\rangle)$, where the index\nfeatures $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ are drawn from a $r$-dimensional\nsubspace, we show that a nonlinear transformer optimized by gradient descent\n(with a pretraining sample complexity that depends on the \\textit{information\nexponent} of the link functions $\\sigma_*$) learns $f_*$ in-context with a\nprompt length that only depends on the dimension of the distribution of target\nfunctions $r$; in contrast, any algorithm that directly learns $f_*$ on test\nprompt yields a statistical complexity that scales with the ambient dimension\n$d$.

Existing\nbenchmarks predominantly focus on English, leaving substantial gaps in\nassessing LLM capabilities in these languages. We introduce MILU, a Multi task\nIndic Language Understanding Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark\ndesigned to address this gap. MILU spans 8 domains and 41 subjects across 11\nIndic languages, reflecting both general and culturally specific knowledge.\nWith an India-centric design, incorporates material from regional and\nstate-level examinations, covering topics such as local history, arts,\nfestivals, and laws, alongside standard subjects like science and mathematics.\nWe evaluate over 42 LLMs, and find that current LLMs struggle with MILU, with\nGPT-4o achieving the highest average accuracy at 74 percent. Open multilingual\nmodels outperform language-specific fine-tuned models, which perform only\nslightly better than random baselines. Models also perform better in high\nresource languages as compared to low resource ones. Domain-wise analysis\nindicates that models perform poorly in culturally relevant areas like Arts and\nHumanities, Law and Governance compared to general fields like STEM. To the\nbest of our knowledge, MILU is the first of its kind benchmark focused on Indic\nlanguages, serving as a crucial step towards comprehensive cultural evaluation.\nAll code, benchmarks, and artifacts are publicly available to foster open\nresearch.",

    "abstract": "The interference between the atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillation\nsub-amplitudes is said to be responsible for CP violation (CPV) in neutrino\nappearance channels. More precisely, CPV is generated by the interference\nbetween the parts of the neutrino oscillation amplitude which are CP even and\nCP odd: even or odd when the neutrino mixing matrix is replaced with its\ncomplex conjugate. This is the CPV interference term, as it gives a\ncontribution to the oscillation probability, the square of the amplitude, which\nis opposite in sign for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos and is unique. For this\ninterference to be non-zero, at least two sub-amplitudes are required. There\nare, however, other interference terms, which are even under the above\nexchange, these are the CP conserving (CPC) interference terms. In this paper,\nwe explore in detail these CPC interference terms and show that they cannot be\nuniquely defined, as one can move pieces of the amplitude from the atmospheric\nsub-amplitude to the solar sub-amplitude and vice versa. This freedom allows\none to move the CPC interference terms around, but does not let you eliminate\nthem completely. We also show that there is a reasonable definition of the\natmospheric and solar sub-amplitudes for the appearance channels such that in\nneutrino disappearance probability there is no atmospheric-solar CPC\ninterference term.

    "abstract": "The discovery of seven ~Earth-mass planets, orbiting the 0.09 solar mass\nM-Dwarf TRAPPIST-1 captivated the public and sparked a proliferation of\ninvestigations into the system's origins. Among other properties, the resonant\narchitecture of the planets has been interpreted to imply that orbital\nmigration played a dominant role in the system's early formation. If correct,\nthis hypothesis could imply that all of the seven worlds formed far from the\nstar, and might harbor enhanced inventories of volatile elements. However,\nmultiple factors also contradict this interpretation. In particular, the\nplanets' apparent rocky compositions and non-hierarchical mass distribution\nmight evidence them having formed closer to their current orbital locations. In\nthis paper, we investigate the latter possibility with over 600 accretion\nsimulations that model the effects of collisional fragmentation. In addition to\nproducing multiple TRAPPIST-like configurations, we experiment with a number of\ndifferent models for tracking the evolution of the planets' volatile contents\nand bulk iron-to-silicate ratios. We conclude that a trend in bulk iron\ncontents is the more likely explanation for the observed radial trend of\ndecreasing uncompressed densities in the real system. Given the degree of\nradial mixing that occurs in our simulations, in most cases we find that all\nseven planets finish with similar volatile contents. Another confounding\nquality of the TRAPPIST-1 system is the fact that the innermost planets are not\nin first-order resonances with one-another. By applying a tidal migration model\nto our most promising accretion model results, we demonstrate cases where\nhigher-order resonances are populated.",

Prior works in\ncomparing LM and human acceptability judgments treat these effects uniformly\nacross models, making a strong assumption that models require the same degree\nof adjustment to control for length and unigram frequency effects. We propose\nMORCELA, a new linking theory between LM scores and acceptability judgments\nwhere the optimal level of adjustment for these effects is estimated from data\nvia learned parameters for length and unigram frequency. We first show that\nMORCELA outperforms a commonly used linking theory for acceptability - SLOR\n(Pauls and Klein, 2012; Lau et al. 2017) - across two families of transformer\nLMs (Pythia and OPT). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the assumed degrees of\nadjustment in SLOR for length and unigram frequency overcorrect for these\nconfounds, and that larger models require a lower relative degree of adjustment\nfor unigram frequency, though a significant amount of adjustment is still\nnecessary for all models. Finally, our subsequent analysis shows that larger\nLMs' lower susceptibility to frequency effects can be explained by an ability\nto better predict rarer words in context.",

Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms,\nreferred to as \"algebraic Bethe circuits\", have been developed to prepare Bethe\nstates for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary\nformulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using\nmatrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space.\nIn this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic\nBethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The\nnew basis, identical to the \"F-basis\" known from the theory of\nquantum-integrable models, generates the linear superposition of plane waves\nthat is characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this\nconnection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the\nexchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic\nBethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits\nfor the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.",

We find that the saturated flux threading the BH has a\nweaker dependence on BH spin, compared to highly magnetized hot (geometrically\nthick) accretion flows. Also, we find that only a fraction ($10-70$ per cent)\nof the extracted BZ power is channeled into the jet, depending on the spin\nparameter. The remaining energy is potentially used to launch winds or\ncontribute to the radiative output of the disk or corona. Our simulations\nreveal that the presence of a strong magnetic field enhances the radiative\nefficiency of the disk, making it more luminous than its weakly magnetized\ncounterpart or the standard disk model.

    "abstract": "In Newtonian gravity, it is well known that Kepler's problem admits no bound\nsolutions in more than three spatial dimensions. This limitation extends\nnaturally to General Relativity, where Tangherlini demonstrated that\nSchwarzschild black holes in higher dimensions admit no bound timelike\ngeodesics. However, an analogous result for the rotating counterpart of the\nfive-dimensional Tangherlini spacetime - the $d=5$ Myers-Perry black hole - has\nnot yet been established. This work addresses this gap by proving that no bound\ntimelike geodesics exist outside the event horizon of a $d=5$ Myers-Perry black\nhole, for any choice of spin parameters that avoid naked singularities. With\nthis result in place, we further generalize to null geodesics. It is shown that\nradially bound null geodesics, which are absent in the four-dimensional Kerr\nspacetime as established by Wilkins, also cannot exist in the $d=5$ Myers-Perry\nspacetime. These results complete the geodesic analysis of this spacetime and\nprovide a direct generalization of Wilkins' classical result to higher\ndimensions. Specifically, we establish the following theorem: no radially bound\ntimelike or null geodesics are possible outside the event horizon of a $d=5$\nMyers-Perry black hole, regardless of the spin configuration.",

Specifically, we consider models\nwhere the dark matter candidates are Standard Model (SM) singlets confined to\nthe TeV brane and interact with the SM via spin-2 and spin-0 gravitational\nKaluza-Klein (KK) modes. We compute the thermal relic density of DM particles\nin these models by applying recent work showing that scattering amplitudes of\nmassive spin-2 KK states involve an intricate cancellation between various\ndiagrams. Considering the resulting DM abundance, collider searches, and the\nabsence of a signal in direct DM detection experiments, we show that spin-2 KK\nportal DM models are highly constrained. We confirm that within the usual\nthermal freeze-out scenario, scalar dark matter models are essentially ruled\nout. In contrast, we show that fermion and vector dark matter models are viable\nin a region of parameter space in which dark matter annihilation through a KK\ngraviton is resonant. Specifically, vector models are viable for dark matter\nmasses ranging from 1.1 TeV to 5.5 TeV for theories in which the scale of\ncouplings of the KK modes is of order 40 TeV or lower. Fermion dark matter\nmodels are viable for a similar mass region, but only for KK coupling scales of\norder 20 TeV. In this work, we provide a complete description of the\ncalculations needed to arrive at these results and, in an appendix, a\ndiscussion of new KK-graviton couplings needed for the computations, which have\nnot previously been discussed in the literature.

Nevertheless, the mechanism responsible for the formation of stellar\npopulations with varying rotation rates remains a topic of debate.

    "abstract": "Star clusters stand at the crossroads between galaxies and single stars.\nResolving the formation of star clusters in cosmological simulations represents\nan ambitious and challenging goal, since modelling their internal properties\nrequires very high resolution. This paper is the third of a series within the\nSImulating the Environment where Globular clusters Emerged (SIEGE) project,\nwhere we conduct zoom-in cosmological simulations with sub-parsec resolution\nthat include the feedback of individual stars, aimed to model the formation of\nstar clusters in high-redshift proto-galaxies. We investigate the role of three\nfundamental quantities in shaping the intrinsic properties of star clusters, i.\ne., i) pre-supernova stellar feedback (continuous or instantaneous ejection of\nmass and energy through stellar winds); ii) star formation efficiency, defined\nas the fraction of gas converted into stars per freefall time, for which we\ntest 2 different values (epsi_ff=0.1 and 1), and iii) stellar initial mass\nfunction (IMF, standard vs top-heavy). All our simulations are run down to\nz=10.5, which is sufficient for investigating some structural properties of the\nemerging clumps and clusters. [Abridged] The prescription for a continuous,\nlow-intensity feedback, along with the adoption of epsi_ff=1, produces star\nclusters with maximum stellar density values up to 10^4 M_sun pc^(-2), in good\nagreement with the surface density-size relation observed in local young star\nclusters (YSCs). Therefore, a realistic stellar wind description and a high\nstar formation effiency are the key ingredients that allow us to achieve\nrealistic star clusters characterised by properties comparable to those of\nlocal YSCs. In contrast, the other models produce too diffuse clusters, in\nparticular the one with a top-heavy IMF.",

The features of the\nmass distribution of these mergers, combined with gravitational wave distance\nmeasurements, will enable precise cosmological inferences, even without the\nneed for electromagnetic counterparts. However, achieving accurate results\nrequires modeling the mass spectrum, particularly considering possible redshift\nevolution. Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are thought to be less influenced\nby changes in metallicity compared to binary black holes (BBH) or neutron\nstar-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This stability in their mass spectrum over\ncosmic time reduces the chances of introducing biases in cosmological\nparameters caused by redshift evolution. In this study, we use the population\nsynthesis code COMPAS to generate astrophysically motivated catalogs of BNS\nmergers and explore whether assuming a non-evolving BNS mass distribution with\nredshift could introduce biases in cosmological parameter inference. Our\nfindings show that despite significant variations in the BNS mass distribution\nacross binary physics assumptions and initial conditions in COMPAS, the joint\nmass-redshift population can be expressed as the product of the mass\ndistribution marginalized over redshift and the redshift distribution\nmarginalized over masses. This enables a 2% unbiased constraint on the Hubble\nconstant-sufficient to address the Hubble tension. Additionally, we show that\nin the fiducial COMPAS setup, the bias from a non-evolving BNS mass model is\nless than 0.5% for the Hubble parameter measured at redshift 0.4. These results\nestablish BNS mergers as strong candidates for spectral siren cosmology in the\nera of next-generation gravitational wave detectors.",

    "abstract": "Both detailed and rapid population studies alike predict that binary black\nhole (BHBH) formation is orders of magnitude more efficient at low metallicity\nthan high metallicity, while binary neutron star (NSNS) formation remains\nmostly flat with metallicity, and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers show\nintermediate behavior. This finding is a key input to employ double compact\nobjects as tracers of low-metallicity star formation, as spectral sirens, and\nfor merger rate calculations. Yet, the literature offers various (sometimes\ncontradicting) explanations for these trends. We investigate the dominant cause\nfor the metallicity dependence of double compact object formation. We find that\nthe BHBH formation efficiency at low metallicity is set by initial condition\ndistributions, and conventional simulations suggest that about \\textit{one in\neight interacting binary systems} with sufficient mass to form black holes will\nlead to a merging BHBH. We further find that the significance of metallicities\nin double compact object formation is a question of formation channel. The\nstable mass transfer and chemically homogeneous evolution channels mainly\ndiminish at high metallicities due to changes in stellar radii, while the\ncommon envelope channel is primarily impacted by the combined effects of\nstellar winds and mass-scaled natal kicks. Outdated giant wind prescriptions\nexacerbate the latter effect, suggesting BHBH formation may be much less\nmetallicity dependent than previously assumed. NSNS formation efficiency\nremains metallicity independent as they form exclusively through the common\nenvelope channel, with natal kicks that are assumed uncorrelated with mass.\nForthcoming GW observations will provide valuable constraints on these\nfindings.",

We present a complex, detailed workflow to\nsimultaneously solve for the geometric distortion (GD) and model the\nundersampled ePSFs of the Euclid detectors. Our procedure was successfully\ndeveloped and tested with data from the Early Release Observations (ERO)\nprogramme focused on the nearby globular cluster NGC 6397. Our final\none-dimensional astrometric precision for a well-measured star just below\nsaturation is 0.7 mas (0.007 pixel) for the Visible Instrument (VIS) and 3 mas\n(0.01 pixel) for the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP). Finally,\nwe present a specific scientific application of this high-precision astrometry:\nthe combination of Euclid and Gaia data to compute proper motions and study the\ninternal kinematics of NGC 6397. Future work, when more data become available,\nwill allow for a better characterisation of the ePSFs and GD corrections that\nare derived here, along with assessment of their temporal stability, and their\ndependencies on the spectral energy distribution of the sources as seen through\nthe wide-band filters of Euclid.",

Using IFU observations, we spatially map the host galaxy stellar\nkinematics across the galaxy and bulge effective radii. We find that that the\ndynamically hot component of galaxy disks correlates with $M_{\\rm BH}$;\nhowever, the correlations are tightest for aperture-integrated $\\sigma_\\star$\nmeasured across the bulge. Accounting for the different $M_{\\rm BH}$\ndistributions, we demonstrate - for the first time - that AGNs follow the same\n$M_{\\rm BH}$-$\\sigma_\\star$ and $M_{\\rm BH}$-$M_{\\rm bulge, dyn}$ relations as\nquiescent galaxies. We confirm that the classical approach of determining the\nvirial factor as sample-average, yielding ${\\rm log }f= 0.65 \\pm 0.18$, is\nconsistent with the average $f$ from individual measurements. The similarity\nbetween the underlying scaling relations of AGNs and quiescent galaxies implies\nthat the current AGN phase is too short to have altered BH masses on a\npopulation level. These results strengthen the local calibration of $f$ for\nmeasuring single-epoch $M_{\\rm BH}$ in the distant Universe.",

While the gravitational wave (GW)\nsignal offers a direct measure of the distance to the source, high-energy\nobservatories can detect the electromagnetic counterpart and drive the optical\nfollow-up providing the redshift of the host galaxy. In this work, we exploit\nup-to-date catalogs of $\\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) supposedly coming from BNS\nmergers observed by the Fermi $\\gamma$-ray Space Telescope and the Neil Gehrels\nSwift Observatory, to construct a large set of mock MM data. We explore how\ncombinations of current and future generations of GW observatories operating\nunder various underlying cosmological models would be able to detect GW signals\nfrom these GRBs. We achieve the reconstruction of the GW parameters by means of\na novel prior-informed Fisher matrix approach. We then use these mock data to\nperform an agnostic reconstruction of the DE phenomenology, thanks to a machine\nlearning method based on forward modeling and Gaussian Processes (GP). Our\nstudy highlights the paramount importance of observatories capable of detecting\nGRBs and identifying their redshift. In the best-case scenario, the GP\nconstraints are 1.5 times more precise than those produced by classical\nparametrizations of the DE evolution.

Through detailed experiments, we show that phonemic and\northographic scripts retrieve distinct examples for in-context learning (ICL).\nThis motivates our proposed Mixed-ICL retrieval strategy, where further\naggregation from both leads to our significant performance improvements for\nboth Latin script languages (up to 12.6%) and non-Latin script languages (up to\n15.1%) compared to randomized ICL retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Generating temporally-consistent high-fidelity videos can be computationally\nexpensive, especially over longer temporal spans. More-recent Diffusion\nTransformers (DiTs) -- despite making significant headway in this context --\nhave only heightened such challenges as they rely on larger models and heavier\nattention mechanisms, resulting in slower inference speeds. In this paper, we\nintroduce a training-free method to accelerate video DiTs, termed Adaptive\nCaching (AdaCache), which is motivated by the fact that \"not all videos are\ncreated equal\": meaning, some videos require fewer denoising steps to attain a\nreasonable quality than others. Building on this, we not only cache\ncomputations through the diffusion process, but also devise a caching schedule\ntailored to each video generation, maximizing the quality-latency trade-off. We\nfurther introduce a Motion Regularization (MoReg) scheme to utilize video\ninformation within AdaCache, essentially controlling the compute allocation\nbased on motion content. Altogether, our plug-and-play contributions grant\nsignificant inference speedups (e.g. up to 4.7x on Open-Sora 720p - 2s video\ngeneration) without sacrificing the generation quality, across multiple video\nDiT baselines.",

First, dimension difference: clinical covariates\nshould be favored because they are low-dimensional and usually have stronger\nprognostic ability than high-dimensional omics covariates. Second,\ninteractions: genetic profiles and their prognostic effects may vary across\npatient subpopulations. Last, redundancy: a (set of) gene(s) may encode similar\nprognostic information as a clinical covariate. To address these challenges, we\ncombine regression trees, employing clinical covariates only, with a\nfusion-like penalized regression framework in the leaf nodes for the omics\ncovariates. The fusion penalty controls the variability in genetic profiles\nacross subpopulations. We prove that the shrinkage limit of the proposed method\nequals a benchmark model: a ridge regression with penalized omics covariates\nand unpenalized clinical covariates. Furthermore, the proposed method allows\nresearchers to evaluate, for different subpopulations, whether the overall\nomics effect enhances prognosis compared to only employing clinical covariates.\nIn an application to colorectal cancer prognosis based on established clinical\ncovariates and 20,000+ gene expressions, we illustrate the features of our\nmethod.",

Polynomial-time\ndimension (denoted $\\mathrm{cdim}_\\mathrm{P}$) quantifies the density of\ninformation of infinite sequences using polynomial time betting algorithms\ncalled $s$-gales. An alternate quantification of the notion of polynomial time\ndensity of information is using polynomial-time Kolmogorov complexity rate\n(denoted $\\mathcal{K}_\\text{poly}$).

However, the ability of\nvideo generation models to discover such laws purely from visual data without\nhuman priors can be questioned. A world model learning the true law should give\npredictions robust to nuances and correctly extrapolate on unseen scenarios. In\nthis work, we evaluate across three key scenarios: in-distribution,\nout-of-distribution, and combinatorial generalization. We developed a 2D\nsimulation testbed for object movement and collisions to generate videos\ndeterministically governed by one or more classical mechanics laws. This\nprovides an unlimited supply of data for large-scale experimentation and\nenables quantitative evaluation of whether the generated videos adhere to\nphysical laws. We trained diffusion-based video generation models to predict\nobject movements based on initial frames. Our scaling experiments show perfect\ngeneralization within the distribution, measurable scaling behavior for\ncombinatorial generalization, but failure in out-of-distribution scenarios.\nFurther experiments reveal two key insights about the generalization mechanisms\nof these models: (1) the models fail to abstract general physical rules and\ninstead exhibit \"case-based\" generalization behavior, i.e., mimicking the\nclosest training example; (2) when generalizing to new cases, models are\nobserved to prioritize different factors when referencing training data: color\n> size > velocity > shape. Our study suggests that scaling alone is\ninsufficient for video generation models to uncover fundamental physical laws,\ndespite its role in Sora's broader success.

    "abstract": "We generalize the proof of stability of topological order, due to Bravyi,\nHastings and Michalakis, to stabilizer Hamiltonians corresponding to\nlow-density parity check (LDPC) codes without the restriction of geometric\nlocality in Euclidean space. We consider Hamiltonians $H_0$ defined by\n$[[N,K,d]]$ LDPC codes which obey certain topological quantum order conditions:\n(i) code distance $d \\geq c \\log(N)$, implying local indistinguishability of\nground states, and (ii) a mild condition on local and global compatibility of\nground states; these include good quantum LDPC codes, and the toric code on a\nhyperbolic lattice, among others. We consider stability under weak\nperturbations that are quasi-local on the interaction graph defined by $H_0$,\nand which can be represented as sums of bounded-norm terms. As long as the\nlocal perturbation strength is smaller than a finite constant, we show that the\nperturbed Hamiltonian has well-defined spectral bands originating from the\n$O(1)$ smallest eigenvalues of $H_0$. The band originating from the smallest\neigenvalue has $2^K$ states, is separated from the rest of the spectrum by a\nfinite energy gap, and has exponentially narrow bandwidth $\\delta = C N\ne^{-\\Theta(d)}$, which is tighter than the best known bounds even in the\nEuclidean case. We also obtain that the new ground state subspace is related to\nthe initial code subspace by a quasi-local unitary, allowing one to relate\ntheir physical properties. Our proof uses an iterative procedure that performs\nsuccessive rotations to eliminate non-frustration-free terms in the\nHamiltonian. Our results extend to quantum Hamiltonians built from classical\nLDPC codes, which give rise to stable symmetry-breaking phases. These results\nshow that LDPC codes very generally define stable gapped quantum phases, even\nin the non-Euclidean setting, initiating a systematic study of such phases of\nmatter.",

    "abstract": "Designing causal bandit algorithms depends on two central categories of\nassumptions: (i) the extent of information about the underlying causal graphs\nand (ii) the extent of information about interventional statistical models.\nThere have been extensive recent advances in dispensing with assumptions on\neither category. These include assuming known graphs but unknown interventional\ndistributions, and the converse setting of assuming unknown graphs but access\nto restrictive hard/$\\operatorname{do}$ interventions, which removes the\nstochasticity and ancestral dependencies. Nevertheless, the problem in its\ngeneral form, i.e., unknown graph and unknown stochastic intervention models,\nremains open. This paper addresses this problem and establishes that in a graph\nwith $N$ nodes, maximum in-degree $d$ and maximum causal path length $L$, after\n$T$ interaction rounds the regret upper bound scales as\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}((cd)^{L-\\frac{1}{2}}\\sqrt{T} + d + RN)$ where $c>1$ is a\nconstant and $R$ is a measure of intervention power. A universal minimax lower\nbound is also established, which scales as $\\Omega(d^{L-\\frac{3}{2}}\\sqrt{T})$.\nImportantly, the graph size $N$ has a diminishing effect on the regret as $T$\ngrows. These bounds have matching behavior in $T$, exponential dependence on\n$L$, and polynomial dependence on $d$ (with the gap $d\\ $). On the algorithmic\naspect, the paper presents a novel way of designing a computationally efficient\nCB algorithm, addressing a challenge that the existing CB algorithms using soft\ninterventions face.",

To overcome these challenges,\nwe propose KG-CoI (Knowledge Grounded Chain of Ideas), a novel system that\nenhances LLM hypothesis generation by integrating external, structured\nknowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs). KG-CoI guides LLMs through a structured\nreasoning process, organizing their output as a chain of ideas (CoI), and\nincludes a KG-supported module for the detection of hallucinations.

Moreover, we prove that the Morse index of a critical point equals\nthe nodal deficiency of the corresponding eigenfunction.

Here we demonstrate a robust\nmulti-pump light wave protocol capable of generating both pure spin and valley\ncurrents on femtosecond times. The generation time is determined by the 2d\nmaterial gap, with the creation of pure spin current in WSe2 at 40 fs and pure\nvalley current in bilayer graphene at ~200 fs. Our all-optical approach demands\nno special material design, requiring only a gapped valley active material, and\nis thus applicable to a wide range of 2d materials.",

Humans and\nrobots both benefit from using touch to perceive and interact with the\nsurrounding environment (Johansson and Flanagan, 2009; Li et al., 2020;\nCalandra et al., 2017). However, no existing systems provide rich, multi-modal\ndigital touch-sensing capabilities through a hemispherical compliant\nembodiment. Here, we describe several conceptual and technological innovations\nto improve the digitization of touch. These advances are embodied in an\nartificial finger-shaped sensor with advanced sensing capabilities.\nSignificantly, this fingertip contains high-resolution sensors (~8.3 million\ntaxels) that respond to omnidirectional touch, capture multi-modal signals, and\nuse on-device artificial intelligence to process the data in real time.\nEvaluations show that the artificial fingertip can resolve spatial features as\nsmall as 7 um, sense normal and shear forces with a resolution of 1.01 mN and\n1.27 mN, respectively, perceive vibrations up to 10 kHz, sense heat, and even\nsense odor. Furthermore, it embeds an on-device AI neural network accelerator\nthat acts as a peripheral nervous system on a robot and mimics the reflex arc\nfound in humans. These results demonstrate the possibility of digitizing touch\nwith superhuman performance. The implications are profound, and we anticipate\npotential applications in robotics (industrial, medical, agricultural, and\nconsumer-level), virtual reality and telepresence, prosthetics, and e-commerce.\nToward digitizing touch at scale, we open-source a modular platform to\nfacilitate future research on the nature of touch.",

Global linear analysis reveals that the free-shear layer\nreduces the required Rm, possibly by introducing an extremum in the vorticity\nof the base flow. Nonlinear simulations validate the results from linear\nanalysis and confirm that a novel instability recently discovered\nexperimentally (Nat. Commun. 13, 4679 (2022)) is the nonaxisymmetric SMRI.

In\ncontrast, the inference of MLLMs involves storing billions of parameters and\nperforming tremendous computation, imposing significant hardware demands. In\nour paper, we propose a Dynamic Early-Exit Framework for Robotic\nVision-Language-Action Model (DeeR-VLA, or simply DeeR) that automatically\nadjusts the size of the activated MLLM based on each situation at hand. The\napproach leverages a multi-exit architecture in MLLMs, which allows the model\nto terminate processing once a proper size of the model has been activated for\na specific situation, thus avoiding further redundant computation.\nAdditionally, we develop novel algorithms that establish early-termination\ncriteria for DeeR, conditioned on predefined demands such as average\ncomputational cost (i.e., power consumption), as well as peak computational\nconsumption (i.e., latency) and GPU memory usage. These enhancements ensure\nthat DeeR operates efficiently under varying resource constraints while\nmaintaining competitive performance.

Through\nover 500,000 evaluations, our investigation yields several key findings: (1)\nFP8 (W8A8-FP) is effectively lossless across all model scales, (2) well-tuned\nINT8 (W8A8-INT) achieves surprisingly low (1-3\\%) accuracy degradation, and (3)\nINT4 weight-only (W4A16-INT) is more competitive than expected, rivaling 8-bit\nquantization. Further, we investigate the optimal quantization format for\ndifferent deployments by analyzing inference performance through the popular\nvLLM framework. Our analysis provides clear deployment recommendations: W4A16\nis the most cost-efficient for synchronous setups, while W8A8 dominates in\nasynchronous continuous batching.

Inflammatory processes in the placenta have short-term, and\nlong-term consequences for offspring health. Digital pathology and machine\nlearning can play an important role in understanding placental inflammation,\nand there have been very few investigations into methods for predicting and\nunderstanding Maternal Inflammatory Response (MIR). This work intends to\ninvestigate the potential of using machine learning to understand MIR based on\nwhole slide images (WSI), and establish early benchmarks. To that end, we use\nMultiple Instance Learning framework with 3 feature extractors: ImageNet-based\nEfficientNet-v2s, and 2 histopathology foundation models, UNI and Phikon to\ninvestigate predictability of MIR stage from histopathology WSIs. We also\ninterpret predictions from these models using the learned attention maps from\nthese models. We also use the MIL framework for predicting white blood cells\ncount (WBC) and maximum fever temperature ($T_{max}$). Attention-based MIL\nmodels are able to classify MIR with a balanced accuracy of up to 88.5% with a\nCohen's Kappa ($\\kappa$) of up to 0.772. Furthermore, we found that the\npathology foundation models (UNI and Phikon) are both able to achieve higher\nperformance with balanced accuracy and $\\kappa$, compared to ImageNet-based\nfeature extractor (EfficientNet-v2s). For WBC and $T_{max}$ prediction, we\nfound mild correlation between actual values and those predicted from\nhistopathology WSIs. We used MIL framework for predicting MIR stage from WSIs,\nand compared effectiveness of foundation models as feature extractors, with\nthat of an ImageNet-based model.

For example, some\nclimbers might prefer more static, technical routes while other climbers may\nspecialize in powerful, dynamic problems.\n  To this end, we apply Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF), a framework\ncommonly used in recommender systems, to represent the unique characteristics\nof climbers and problems with latent, multi-dimensional vectors.

    "abstract": "Next-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories, such as the Einstein\nTelescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer, will observe binary neutron star (BNS)\nmergers across cosmic history, providing precise parameter estimates for the\nclosest ones. Innovative wide-field observatories, such as the Vera Rubin\nObservatory, will quickly cover large portions of the sky with unprecedented\nsensitivity to detect faint transients. This study aims to assess the prospects\nfor detecting optical emissions from BNS mergers with next-generation\ndetectors, considering how uncertainties in neutron star (NS) population\nproperties and microphysics may affect detection rates. Starting from BNS\nmerger populations exploiting different NS mass distributions and equations of\nstate (EOSs), we model the GW and kilonova (KN) signals based on source\nproperties. We model KN ejecta through numerical-relativity informed fits,\nconsidering the effect of prompt collapse of the remnant to black hole and new\nfitting formulas appropriate for more massive BNS systems, like GW190425. We\ninclude optical afterglow emission from relativistic jets consistent with\nobserved short gamma-ray bursts. We evaluate the detected mergers and the\nsource parameter estimations for different geometries of ET, operating alone or\nin a network of current or next-generation GW detectors. Finally, we estimate\nthe number of detected optical signals simulating realistic observational\nstrategies by the Rubin Observatory. ET as a single observatory will enable the\ndetection of about ten to a hundred KNe per year by the Rubin Observatory. This\nimproves by a factor of about 10 already when operating in the network with\ncurrent GW detectors. Detection rate uncertainties are dominated by the poorly\nconstrained local BNS merger rate, and depend to a lesser extent on the NS mass\ndistribution and EOS.",

A possible approach to enhance the optical detection is to exploit\nnonlinearity of strong coupling regime, especially for elastic light\nscattering, which is universal to all objects. However, there is still no\nobservation of the strong coupling of elastic light scattering from\nnanoobjects. Here, we demonstrate the strong coupling of elastic light\nscattering in self-assembled plasmonic nanocavities formed between a gold (Au)\nnanoprobe and an Au film. We employ this technique to detect individual objects\nwith diameters down to 1.8 nm inside the nanocavity. The resonant mode of the\nnano-object on the Au film strongly couples with the nanocavity mode, revealing\nanti-crossing scattering modes under dark-field spectroscopy. The experimental\nresult agrees well with numerical calculations, which we use to extend this\ntechnique to other metals, including silver, copper, and aluminum. Furthermore,\nour results show that the scattering cross-section ratio of the nano-object\nscales with the electric f ield to the fourth power, similar to\nsurface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.

Recent work revealed\nthat myosin's velocity-dependent detachment rate can bridge actomyosin dynamics\nto macroscale Hill muscle predictions. However, the influence of this\nmicroscale unbinding, which we characterize by a dimensionless parameter\n$\\alpha$, on macroscale energetic flows-such as power consumption, output and\nefficiency-remains elusive. Here we develop an analytical model of myosin\ndynamics that relates unbinding rates $\\alpha$ to energetics. Our model agrees\nwith published in-vivo muscle data and, furthermore, uncovers a\nperformance-efficiency tradeoff governed by $\\alpha$. To experimentally\nvalidate the tradeoff, we build HillBot, a robophysical model of Hill's muscle\nthat mimics nonlinearity.

We compile 136 published measurements of $\\alpha$ in muscle and\nmyoblasts to reveal a distribution centered at $\\alpha^* = 3.85 \\pm 2.32$.\nSynthesizing data from our model and HillBot, we quantitatively show that\n$\\alpha^*$ corresponds to a class of generalist actuators that are both\nrelatively powerful and efficient, suggesting that the performance-efficiency\ntradeoff underpins the prevalence of $\\alpha^*$ in nature.

Despite recent\nadvancements in Text-to-Texture (T2T) generation, existing methods often yield\nsubpar results, primarily due to local discontinuities, inconsistencies across\nmultiple views, and their heavy dependence on UV unwrapping outcomes. To tackle\nthese challenges, we propose a novel generation-refinement 3D texturing\nframework called MVPaint, which can generate high-resolution, seamless textures\nwhile emphasizing multi-view consistency. MVPaint mainly consists of three key\nmodules. 1) Synchronized Multi-view Generation (SMG). Given a 3D mesh model,\nMVPaint first simultaneously generates multi-view images by employing an SMG\nmodel, which leads to coarse texturing results with unpainted parts due to\nmissing observations. 2) Spatial-aware 3D Inpainting (S3I). To ensure complete\n3D texturing, we introduce the S3I method, specifically designed to effectively\ntexture previously unobserved areas. 3) UV Refinement (UVR). Furthermore,\nMVPaint employs a UVR module to improve the texture quality in the UV space,\nwhich first performs a UV-space Super-Resolution, followed by a Spatial-aware\nSeam-Smoothing algorithm for revising spatial texturing discontinuities caused\nby UV unwrapping. Moreover, we establish two T2T evaluation benchmarks: the\nObjaverse T2T benchmark and the GSO T2T benchmark, based on selected\nhigh-quality 3D meshes from the Objaverse dataset and the entire GSO dataset,\nrespectively.

Although\npromoting greater activation sparsity within LLMs deserves deep studies,\nexisting works lack comprehensive and quantitative research on the correlation\nbetween activation sparsity and potentially influential factors. In this paper,\nwe present a comprehensive study on the quantitative scaling properties and\ninfluential factors of the activation sparsity within decoder-only\nTransformer-based LLMs. Specifically, we propose PPL-$p\\%$ sparsity, a precise\nand performance-aware activation sparsity metric that is applicable to any\nactivation function. Through extensive experiments, we find several important\nphenomena. Firstly, different activation functions exhibit comparable\nperformance but opposite training-time sparsity trends. The activation ratio\n(i.e., $1-\\mathrm{sparsity\\ ratio}$) evolves as a convergent increasing\npower-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data\nfor SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate\nthat ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can\nleverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the\nactivation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain\nbottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture\nat a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we\nsurprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly\nwith the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are\ninsensitive to the parameter scale. These empirical laws towards LLMs with\ngreater activation sparsity have important implications for making LLMs more\nefficient and interpretable.",

In the proposed framework, the transmitter\ndecomposes the source signal into multiple semantic classes based on the\nmulti-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of\nonly a subset of the semantic classes. To better utilize the wireless\nresources, the transmitter sends to each user only its intended classes, and\nmulticasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless\nresources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, namely\nnon-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models.

However, processes\nfor supporting end-user hardware troubleshooting or routine maintenance aren't\nwell defined. As a result, providing technical support for hardware remains\nad-hoc and challenging to scale. Inspired by patterns that helped scale\nsoftware troubleshooting, we propose a workflow for asynchronous hardware\ntroubleshooting: SplatOverflow.\n  SplatOverflow creates a novel boundary object, the SplatOverflow scene, that\nusers reference to communicate about hardware.

The\nsplat captures the current state of the hardware, and the registered CAD model\nacts as a referential anchor for troubleshooting instructions. With\nSplatOverflow, remote maintainers can directly address issues and author\ninstructions in the user's workspace. Workflows containing multiple\ninstructions can easily be shared between users and recontextualized in new\nenvironments.\n  In this paper, we describe the design of SplatOverflow, the workflows it\nenables, and its utility to different kinds of users.

While square\nlattices, due to their simplicity, have been used for models supporting\nnontrivial topology, several exotic topological phenomena such as Dirac points,\nWeyl points and Haldane phases are most commonly supported by non-square\nlattices. Examples of prototypical non-square lattices include the honeycomb\nlattice of graphene and the Kagome lattice, both of which break fundamental\nsymmetries and can exhibit quantized transport, especially when long-range\nhoppings and gauge fields are incorporated. The challenge of controllably\nrealizing long-range hoppings and gauge fields has motivated a large body of\nresearch focused on harnessing lattices encoded in \"synthetic\" dimensions.\nPhotons in particular have many internal degrees of freedom and hence show\npromise for implementing these synthetic dimensions; however, most photonic\nsynthetic dimensions has hitherto created 1D or 2D square lattices. Here we\nshow that non-square lattice Hamiltonians can be implemented using Floquet\nsynthetic dimensions. Our construction uses dynamically modulated ring\nresonators and provides the capacity for direct $k$-space engineering of\nlattice Hamiltonians. Such a construction lifts constraints on the\northogonality of lattice vectors that make square geometries simpler to\nimplement, and instead transfers the complexity to the engineering of complex\nFloquet drive signals. We simulate topological signatures of the Haldane and\nthe brick-wall Haldane model and observe them to be robust in the presence of\nexternal optical drive and photon loss, and discuss unique characteristics of\ntheir topological transport when implemented on these Floquet lattices.

However, the challenge of developing a unified model for both\nshort and long video understanding remains unresolved. Most existing video LLMs\ncannot handle hour-long videos, while methods custom for long videos tend to be\nineffective for shorter videos and images. In this paper, we identify the key\nissue as the redundant content in videos. To address this, we propose a novel\npooling strategy that simultaneously achieves token compression and\ninstruction-aware visual feature aggregation. Our model is termed Prompt-guided\nPooling LLaVA, or PPLLaVA for short. Specifically, PPLLaVA consists of three\ncore components: the CLIP-based visual-prompt alignment that extracts visual\ninformation relevant to the user's instructions, the prompt-guided pooling that\ncompresses the visual sequence to arbitrary scales using convolution-style\npooling, and the clip context extension designed for lengthy prompt common in\nvisual dialogue. Moreover, our codebase also integrates the most advanced video\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) and visual interleave training. Extensive\nexperiments have validated the performance of our model. With superior\nthroughput and only 1024 visual context, PPLLaVA achieves better results on\nimage benchmarks as a video LLM, while achieving state-of-the-art performance\nacross various video benchmarks, excelling in tasks ranging from caption\ngeneration to multiple-choice questions, and handling video lengths from\nseconds to hours.

This study empirically evaluates\nStarCoder2, an LLM optimized for code generation, in refactoring code across 30\nopen-source Java projects. We compare StarCoder2's performance against human\ndevelopers, focusing on (1) code quality improvements, (2) types and\neffectiveness of refactorings, and (3) enhancements through one-shot and\nchain-of-thought prompting. Our results indicate that StarCoder2 reduces code\nsmells by 20.1% more than developers, excelling in systematic issues like Long\nStatement and Magic Number, while developers handle complex, context-dependent\nissues better. One-shot prompting increases the unit test pass rate by 6.15%\nand improves code smell reduction by 3.52%. Generating five refactorings per\ninput further increases the pass rate by 28.8%, suggesting that combining\none-shot prompting with multiple refactorings optimizes performance.

In this paper,\nwe propose to jointly investigate general 3D and 4D generation by leveraging\ncamera and object movements commonly observed in daily life. Due to the lack of\nreal-world 4D data in the community, we first propose a data curation pipeline\nto obtain camera poses and object motion strength from videos. Based on this\npipeline, we introduce a large-scale real-world 4D scene dataset: CamVid-30K.\nBy leveraging all the 3D and 4D data, we develop our framework, GenXD, which\nallows us to produce any 3D or 4D scene. We propose multiview-temporal modules,\nwhich disentangle camera and object movements, to seamlessly learn from both 3D\nand 4D data. Additionally, GenXD employs masked latent conditions to support a\nvariety of conditioning views. GenXD can generate videos that follow the camera\ntrajectory as well as consistent 3D views that can be lifted into 3D\nrepresentations. We perform extensive evaluations across various real-world and\nsynthetic datasets, demonstrating GenXD's effectiveness and versatility\ncompared to previous methods in 3D and 4D generation.",

We study this phenomenon by training LLMs with Reinforcement\nLearning with simulated user feedback in environments of practical LLM usage.\nIn our settings, we find that: 1) Extreme forms of \"feedback gaming\" such as\nmanipulation and deception are learned reliably; 2) Even if only 2% of users\nare vulnerable to manipulative strategies, LLMs learn to identify and target\nthem while behaving appropriately with other users, making such behaviors\nharder to detect; 3) To mitigate this issue, it may seem promising to leverage\ncontinued safety training or LLM-as-judges during training to filter\nproblematic outputs. Instead, we found that while such approaches help in some\nof our settings, they backfire in others, sometimes even leading to subtler\nmanipulative behaviors.

Integrating AI agents into CRM systems can automate routine processes and\nenhance personalized service.

To address this issue, we introduce CRMArena, a novel\nbenchmark designed to evaluate AI agents on realistic tasks grounded in\nprofessional work environments. Following guidance from CRM experts and\nindustry best practices, we designed CRMArena with nine customer service tasks\ndistributed across three personas: service agent, analyst, and manager. The\nbenchmark includes 16 commonly used industrial objects (e.g., account, order,\nknowledge article, case) with high interconnectivity, along with latent\nvariables (e.g., complaint habits, policy violations) to simulate realistic\ndata distributions. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art LLM\nagents succeed in less than 40% of the tasks with ReAct prompting, and less\nthan 55% even with function-calling abilities.

It has been suggested that second-generation stars could form in a\ndisk from gas lost by first-generation stars or from external accreted gas.\nAims. We investigate how the introduction of a second stellar generation\naffects mass loss, internal mixing, and rotational properties of GCs in a\ntime-varying Galactic tidal field and different orbital configurations.\nMethods. We conducted direct N-body simulations of GCs on three types of orbits\nderived from the observed Milky Way GCs. We evolved the clusters for 8 Gyr in\nthe time-varying Galactic potential of the IllustrisTNG-100 cosmological\nsimulation. After 2 Gyr, we introduced a second stellar generation, comprising\n5% of the initial mass of the first generation, as a flattened disk of stars.\nFor comparison, we ran control simulations using a static Galactic potential\nand isolated clusters. Results. We present the mass loss, structural evolution,\nand kinematic properties of GCs with two stellar generations, focusing on tidal\nmass, half-mass radii, velocity distributions, and angular momentum.\nConclusions. Our results show that the mass loss of GCs depends primarily on\ntheir orbital parameters, with tighter orbits leading to higher mass loss. The\nGalaxy's growth resulted in tighter orbits, meaning GCs lost less mass than if\nits mass had always been constant. The initially flattened second-generation\ndisk became nearly spherical within one relaxation time. However, whether its\ndistinct rotational signature was retained depends on the orbit: for the long\nradial orbit, it vanished quickly; for the tube orbit, it lasted several Gyr;\nbut for the circular orbit, rotation persisted until the present day",

Specifically, these\nstudies indicate that magnetism is more prevalent in WDs with fully or\npartially crystallized cores compared to those with entirely liquid cores. This\nhas led to the recognition of a crystallization-driven dynamo as an important\nmechanism for explaining magnetism in isolated WDs. However, recent simulations\nchallenged the capability of this mechanism to match both the incidence of\nmagnetism and the field strengths detected in WDs. In this letter, we explore\nan alternative hypothesis for the surface emergence of magnetic fields in\nisolated WDs. WDs with masses $\\gtrsim 0.55 M_\\odot$ are the descendants of\nmain-sequence stars with convective cores capable of generating strong dynamo\nmagnetic fields. This idea is supported by asteroseismic evidence of strong\nmagnetic fields buried within the interiors of red giant branch stars. Assuming\nthat these fields are disrupted by subsequent convective zones, we have\nestimated magnetic breakout times for WDs. Due to the significant uncertainties\nin breakout times stemming from the treatment of convective boundaries and mass\nloss rates, we cannot provide a precise prediction for the emergence time of\nthe main-sequence dynamo field. However, we can predict that this emergence\nshould occur during the WD phase for WDs with masses $\\gtrsim 0.65 M_\\odot$. We\nalso find that the magnetic breakout is expected to occur earlier in more\nmassive WDs, consistently with observations from volume-limited samples and the\nwell-established fact that magnetic WDs tend to be more massive than\nnon-magnetic ones.

    "abstract": "The Quasi-Geostrophic (QG) system has served as a useful simplified model for\nunderstanding geophysical fluid phenomena. The fact that it is based on only\none prognostic variable -- potential vorticity (PV) -- is a simplification that\nhas facilitated much theoretical understanding. However, although QG captures\nmany geophysical turbulence phenomena, it misses important features that occur\nin shallow water systems at finite Rossby numbers, even those that are\n``balanced''. For example, QG does not capture the emergent vorticity asymmetry\nor the finite divergence of the velocity fields. Here we present a\nnext-order-in-Rossby extension of QG in the single-layer and multi-layer\nshallow water context: SWQG$^{+1}$. A freely decaying simulation shows that\nSWQG$^{+1}$ can capture the negatively skewed vorticity found in simulations of\nthe shallow water model in the same setting. We also extend the model to the\nmulti-layer configuration. Simulations of nonlinear evolution of a\nbaroclinically unstable jet in SWQG$^{+1}$ show that it can capture vorticity\nasymmetry and finite divergence of strain-driven fronts.",

    "abstract": "In the first part of the work, the equivalence of quantum deterministic and\nprobabilistic processors was investigated. A programmable quantum processor is\na device able to transform input data states in a desired way. Deterministic\nequivalence as well as three types of probabilistic equivalences - strong,\nweak, and structural - were defined. Necessary and sufficient conditions for\ndeterministic and structural equivalence of unitarily related processors were\ndiscovered. Equivalence of deterministic SWAP processor for two-dimensional\ndata and two-dimensional program space was completely solved. It was found that\nspans of operators of structurally equivalent processors are identical.\nRelations between types of individual equivalences were also examined.\n  In the second part, robustness of probabilistic storing and retrieval device\n(PSAR), originally optimized for implementing a phase gate, to noise was\nexamined - specifically to depolarization and phase damping. In the case of a\ndepolarizing channel mixed with a unitary channel, the device implements noisy\nchannel with the probability that decreases with an increasing number of times\nthe given channel is applied. In the case of the phase damping channel, the\ndevice implements noisy channel with the same probability as the original PSAR\ndevice optimized for phase gate. Concrete implementations - through the\nVidal-Masanes-Cirac scheme and virtual qudit - were examined.\nVidal-Masanes-Cirac gives the same result for both noisy channels which is\nbetter than the result from PSAR. Implementation through virtual qudit for\ndepolarization yields worse probability of successful measurement than\nVidal-Masanes-Cirac. However, it is still better than the probability for PSAR.\nProbability of successful measurement obtained for phase damping implemented\nthrough virtual qudit is the same as for Vidal-Masanes-Cirac and PSAR.",

Greater distances can\nbe achieved through new experimental configurations, where the initial wave\nfunctions of the particles are allowed to spread perpendicularly to the\nseparation axis.

The proposed model leverages a masked\nself-attention mechanism to capture salient brain connectivity patterns and\nemploys EdgeSHAP to provide post-hoc explanations of the neurological states\nafter a stroke. We evaluated our method on EEG recordings from four\ninstitutions, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.23 in predicting\nNIHSS, close to the average error made by human experts (MAE $\\approx$ 3.0).\nThis demonstrates the method's effectiveness in providing accurate and\nexplainable predictions while maintaining data privacy.",

However, the computational expense of these models\ncan limit their application. As such, a process known as knowledge distillation\nis frequently applied to allow a smaller, efficient model to learn from an\neffective but expensive model. A key example of this is the distillation of\nexpensive API-based commercial Large Language Models into smaller\nproduction-ready models. However, due to the opacity of training data and\nprocesses of most commercial models, one cannot ensure that a chosen test\ncollection has not been observed previously, creating the potential for\ninadvertent data contamination. We, therefore, investigate the effect of a\ncontaminated teacher model in a distillation setting. We evaluate several\ndistillation techniques to assess the degree to which contamination occurs\nduring distillation. By simulating a ``worst-case'' setting where the degree of\ncontamination is known, we find that contamination occurs even when the test\ndata represents a small fraction of the teacher's training samples. We,\ntherefore, encourage caution when training using black-box teacher models where\ndata provenance is ambiguous.",

In this\npaper, we propose CXL-DMSim, an open-source full-system simulator to simulate\nCXL disaggregated memory systems with high fidelity at a gem5-comparable\nsimulation speed. CXL-DMSim incorporates a flexible CXL memory expander model\nalong with its associated device driver, and CXL protocol support with CXL.io\nand CXL.mem. It can operate in both app-managed mode and kernel-managed mode,\nwith the latter using a dedicated NUMA-compatible mechanism. The simulator has\nbeen rigorously verified against a real hardware testbed with both FPGAand\nASIC-based CXL memory devices, which demonstrates the qualification of\nCXL-DMSim in simulating the characteristics of various CXL memory devices at an\naverage simulation error of 3.4%. The experimental results using LMbench and\nSTREAM benchmarks suggest that the CXL-FPGA memory exhibits a ~2.88x higher\nlatency than local DDR while the CXL-ASIC latency is ~2.18x; CXL-FPGA achieves\n45-69% of local DDR memory bandwidth, whereas the number for CXLASIC is 82-83%.\nThe study also reveals that CXL memory can significantly enhance the\nperformance of memory-intensive applications, improved by 23x at most with\nlimited local memory for Viper key-value database and approximately 60% in\nmemorybandwidth-sensitive scenarios such as MERCI.

These methods typically treat missing values as\nabsent information, rather than recognizing them as valuable for profiling\npopulation characteristics. To address this gap, we introduce a Bayesian\nnonparametric model for co-clustering multivariate ordinal data that treats\ncensored observations as informative, rather than merely missing. We\ndemonstrate that this offers a significant improvement in understanding the\nunderlying structure of the data. Our model exploits the flexibility of two\nindependent Dirichlet processes, allowing us to infer potentially distinct\nsubpopulations that characterize the latent structure of both subjects and\nvariables. The ordinal nature of the data is addressed by introducing latent\nvariables, while a matrix factorization specification is adopted to handle the\nhigh dimensionality of the data in a parsimonious way. The conjugate structure\nof the model enables an explicit derivation of the full conditional\ndistributions of all the random variables in the model, which facilitates\nseamless posterior inference using a Gibbs sampling algorithm. We demonstrate\nthe method's performance through simulations and by analyzing politician and\nmovie ratings data.",

In this paper, we perform a ringdown Fisher forecast\nwhen including the dominant quadratic QNM (QQNM) expected in nearly equal-mass\nquasi-circular binary black holes (BBHs) observed by next-generation\nground-based detectors, Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). We\nconsider a ringdown model with a total of four modes: three linear QNMs labeled\nby $(\\ell m n)=(220), (330), (440)$ and one QQNM coming from the\nself-interaction of the dominant linear (220) QNM. We perform a forecast in two\nscenarios, when the QQNM parameters are considered to be: (a) independent of\nthe linear QNMs; (b) dependent on the (220) QNM parameters, according to GR. In\nScenario (a) we find the QQNM to generally be measured with better precision\nthan the (440) mode but worse than the (330) mode. As shown in the past,\nhigh-spin BBHs tend to have higher relative QQNMs. Even in such cases, we only\nexpect to confidently detect and resolve these four independent QNMs for nearby\nevents, below redshift $z\\sim 0.5$ in ET and CE for intermediate-mass BHs. In\nScenario (b) we find the QQNM to be extremely useful for improving the\nprecision on the (440) parameters, with negligible improvements on the (220)\nparameters. In this case, the (440) parameters are expected to be measured even\nbetter than those of the (330) QNM. As a result, we expect to confidently\ndetect and resolve the three independent linear QNMs for events even at high\nredshifts, up to $z\\sim 35$ in ET and CE for intermediate-mass BHs. Therefore,\nthanks to the inclusion of the QQNM, virtually all second-generation BBH events\nwill provide excellent consistency tests of GR.",

The\nRabi pulse generates a photon recoil of the atom, due to the Lamb-Dicke\ncoupling between the internal and motional degree of freedom, driving the\nsystem out of the logical subspace. This detrimental effect is strongly\nsuppressed in the protocols that we propose.

In this paper, we present a complete description\nof the nonlinear model for primordial oscillatory features in the context of\ntime-sliced perturbation theory extending the results already presented in the\nliterature. We derive analytical expressions including novel contributions such\nas the mixed term between primordial oscillations and baryon acoustic\noscillations, and we also calculate the corrections arising from the specific\nenvelope of the oscillatory pattern, corresponding to a scale-dependent\namplitude. These results are compared with N-body simulations using the COLA\nmethod and show consistent behaviour across different scales. Although the\ncorrections are found to be small, they represent an important step to fully\ncharacterising the nonlinear imprints of primordial features on the matter\npower spectrum.

However, the stochastic nature of ambient energy\nsources often results in insufficient harvesting rates, failing to meet the\nenergy requirements for inference and causing significant performance\ndegradation in energy-agnostic systems. To address this problem, we consider an\non-device adaptive inference system equipped with an energy-harvester and\nfinite-capacity energy storage. We then allow the device to reduce the run-time\nexecution cost on-demand, by either switching between differently-sized neural\nnetworks, referred to as multi-model selection (MMS), or by enabling earlier\npredictions at intermediate layers, called early exiting (EE). The model to be\nemployed, or the exit point is then dynamically chosen based on the energy\nstorage and harvesting process states. We also study the efficacy of\nintegrating the prediction confidence into the decision-making process. We\nderive a principled policy with theoretical guarantees for confidence-aware and\n-agnostic controllers. Moreover, in multi-exit networks, we study the\nadvantages of taking decisions incrementally, exit-by-exit, by designing a\nlightweight reinforcement learning-based controller. Experimental results show\nthat, as the rate of the ambient energy increases, energy- and confidence-aware\ncontrol schemes show approximately 5% improvement in accuracy compared to their\nenergy-aware confidence-agnostic counterparts. Incremental approaches achieve\neven higher accuracy, particularly when the energy storage capacity is limited\nrelative to the energy consumption of the inference model.",

We revisit the astrophysical distribution of those spins based on\ngravitational waves from the third gravitational wave transient catalog GWTC-3,\n(Abbott et al. 2023a), looking for structure in the two-dimensional space\ndefined by the dimensionless spin magnitudes of the heavier ($\\chi_1$) and\nlighter ($\\chi_2$) component black holes. We find support for two distinct\nsubpopulations with greater than $95\\%$ credibility. The dominant population is\nmade up of black holes with small spins, preferring $\\chi_1 \\approx 0.2$ for\nthe primary and $\\chi_2 \\approx 0$ for the secondary; we report signs of an\nanticorrelation between $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$, as well as as evidence against a\nsubpopulation of binaries in which both components are nonspinning. The\nsubdominant population consists of systems in which both black holes have\nrelatively high spins and contains $20^{+18}_{-18}\\%$ of the binaries. The\nbinaries that are most likely to belong in this subpopulation are massive and\nslightly more likely to have spin-orientations aligned with the orbital angular\nmomentum--potentially consistent with isolated binary formation channels\ncapable of producing large spins, like chemically homogeneous evolution. This\nhint of a rapidly spinning subpopulation hinges on GW190517, a binary with\nlarge and well-measured spins. Our results, which are enabled by novel\nhierarchical inference methods, represent a first step towards more descriptive\npopulation models for black hole spins, and will be strengthened or refuted by\nthe large number of gravitational wave detections expected in the next several\nyears.",

In this paper, we propose a dual (integer) problem\nrepresentation that serves as an alternative to the classical binary\nformulation of the problem. We attack this problem incrementally: firstly, we\npropose basic algorithms (i.e. local search techniques and genetic algorithms)\nintended to work separately on the two different search spaces (i.e. binary and\ninteger); secondly, we propose two hybrid schemes: an integrative approach\n(i.e. a memetic algorithm) and a collaborative model in which the previous\nmethods work in parallel, occasionally exchanging information. Three distinct\ntwo-dimensional structures are proposed as communication topology among the\nalgorithms involved in the collaborative model, as well as a number of\nmigration and acceptance criteria for sending and receiving data. An empirical\nanalysis comparing a large number of instances of our schemes (with algorithms\npossibly working on different search spaces and with/without symmetry breaking\nmethods) shows that some of these algorithms can be considered the state of the\nart of the metaheuristic methods applied to finding BIBDs. Moreover, our\ncooperative proposal is a general scheme from which distinct algorithmic\nvariants can be instantiated to handle symmetrical optimisation problems.

    "abstract": "Measuring the Hubble constant (H$_0$) is one of the most important missions\nin astronomy. Nevertheless, recent studies exhibit differences between the\nemployed methods. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are coherent radio transients with\nlarge dispersion measures (DM) with a duration of milliseconds. DM$_{\\rm IGM}$,\nDM in the intergalactic medium (IGM), could open a new avenue for probing\nH$_0$. However, it has been challenging to separate DM contributions from\ndifferent components (i.e., the IGM and the host galaxy plasma), and this\nhampers the accurate measurements of DM$_{\\rm IGM}$ and hence H$_0$. We adopted\na method to overcome this problem by using the temporal scattering of the FRB\npulses due to the propagation effect through the host galaxy plasma (scattering\ntime). The scattering-inferred DM in a host galaxy improves the estimate of\nDM$_{\\rm IGM}$, which in turn leads to a better constraint on H$_0$. In\nprevious studies, a certain value or distribution has conventionally been\nassumed of the dispersion measure in host galaxies (DM$_{\\rm h}$). We compared\nthis method with ours by generating 100 mock FRBs, and we found that our method\nreduces the systematic (statistical) error of H$_0$ by 9.1% (1%) compared to\nthe previous method. We applied our method to 30 localized FRB sources with\nboth scattering and spectroscopic redshift measurements to constrain H$_0$. Our\nresult is H$_0$=74$_{-7.2}^{+7.5}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, where the central\nvalue prefers the value obtained from local measurements over the cosmic\nmicrowave background. We also measured DM$_{\\rm h}$ with a median value of\n$103^{+68}_{-48}$ pc cm$^{-3}$. The reduction in systematic error is comparable\nto the Hubble tension ($\\sim10$%). Combined with the fact that more localized\nFRBs will become available, our result indicates that our method can be used to\naddress the Hubble tension using future FRB samples.",

These maps show an array of\nslanted tracks whose average slope indicates the east-west speed of faculae at\nthat latitude, Ls. When the slopes are measured and plotted as a function of\nlatitude, they show relatively little scatter 0.01-02 km/s from a straight line\nwhose zero-speed extension passes through the Sun's south pole. This means that\nthe speed, v(Ls), and the latitudinal radius, R cos(Ls), approach 0 at the same\nrate, so that their ratio gives a nearly constant synodic rotation rate 8.6\ndeg/day surrounding the Sun's south pole.

Tolerant junta testing is\nmore general and challenging than the standard version. While optimal tolerant\njunta testers have been obtained for Boolean functions, there has been no\nknowledge about tolerant junta testers for unitary operators, which was thus\nleft as an open problem in [Chen, Nadimpalli, and Yuen, SODA2023]. In this\npaper, we settle this problem by presenting the first algorithm to decide\nwhether a unitary is $\\epsilon_1$-close to some quantum $k$-junta or is\n$\\epsilon_2$-far from any quantum $k$-junta, where an $n$-qubit unitary $U$ is\ncalled a quantum $k$-junta if it only non-trivially acts on just $k$ of the $n$\nqubits.

However, as these\narchitectures scale, improving stability and robustness becomes critical. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel photonic braid interferometer architecture\nthat outperforms both the Clements and Fldzhyan designs in these aspects. Using\nnumerical simulations, we evaluate the performance of these architectures under\nideal conditions and systematically introduce non-idealities such as insertion\nlosses, beam splitter imbalances, and crosstalk. The results demonstrate that\nthe braid architecture offers superior robustness due to its symmetrical design\nand reduced layer count. Further analysis shows that the braid architecture is\nparticularly advantageous in large-scale implementations, delivering better\nperformance as the size of the interferometer increases. We also assess the\nfootprint and total insertion losses of each architecture. Although waveguide\ncrossings in the braid architecture slightly increase the footprint and\ninsertion loss, recent advances in crossing technology significantly minimize\nthese effects.

We explore the setting where a `batch' of $m$ independent such\nunlabeled examples is given, and the goal is to construct a batch prediction\nset with 1-$\\alpha$ coverage. Unlike individual prediction sets, the batch\nprediction set is a collection of label vectors of size $m$, while the\ncalibration sample consists of univariate labels. A natural approach is to\napply the Bonferroni correction, which concatenates individual prediction sets\nat level $1-\\alpha/m$. We propose a uniformly more powerful solution, based on\nspecific combinations of conformal $p$-values that exploit the Simes\ninequality. We provide a general recipe for valid inference with any\ncombinations of conformal $p$-values, and compare the performance of several\nuseful choices. Intuitively, the pooled evidence of relatively `easy' examples\nwithin the batch can help provide narrower batch prediction sets.

    "abstract": "Recognizing the sounding objects in scenes is a longstanding objective in\nembodied AI, with diverse applications in robotics and AR/VR/MR. To that end,\nAudio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to\nidentify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with\nsynchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However,\nthis paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping\nfrom 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation,\nwe introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending\nthe existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due\nto variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse\nacoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we\ncreate the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing\nphotorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under\nsingle-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object\ncategories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to\ngenerate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and\ncorresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet,\ncharacterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D\naudio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene\nrepresentation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment\nsounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant\nadvancement in the field of embodied AI.

Although there exists a\npriority vector that satisfies the conditions of order preservation (COP), the\npriority vectors obtained through existing prioritization methods frequently\nviolate these conditions, resulting in numerous COP violations. To address this\nissue, this paper introduces a novel procedure to manage COP violations in AHP.\nFirstly, we prove that the index-exchangeability condition is both a necessary\nand sufficient condition for determining whether a priority vector satisfies\nCOP. This enables the direct detection of COP violations, relying solely on the\npairwise comparison preferences of decision-makers, rather than the\nprioritization methods utilized. Subsequently, we propose the Minimal Number of\nViolations and Deviations Method (MNVDM) model, which aims to derive a priority\nvector with the minimal number of COP violations. In particular, the MNVDM can\nobtain a violation-free priority vector when the PCM meets the index\nexchangeability conditions. Furthermore, an optimization model based on\nminimizing information loss is designed to ensure the COP by revising the\npreferences when the index-exchangeability conditions are violated. Finally,\nthe feasibility and efficiency of the proposed models are validated through\nnumerical examples and Monte Carlo simulation experiments.

This requires\naccounting for synergistic/antagonistic interactions between surfactants;\nhowever, predictive ML models for a wide spectrum of mixtures are missing so\nfar. Herein, we develop a graph neural network (GNN) framework for surfactant\nmixtures to predict the temperature-dependent CMC. We collect data for 108\nsurfactant binary mixtures, to which we add data for pure species from our\nprevious work [Brozos et al. (2024), J. Chem. Theory Comput.]. We then develop\nand train GNNs and evaluate their accuracy across different prediction test\nscenarios for binary mixtures relevant to practical applications. The final GNN\nmodels demonstrate very high predictive performance when interpolating between\ndifferent mixture compositions and for new binary mixtures with known species.\nExtrapolation to binary surfactant mixtures where either one or both surfactant\nspecies are not seen before, yields accurate results for the majority of\nsurfactant systems. We further find superior accuracy of the GNN over a\nsemi-empirical model based on activity coefficients, which has been widely used\nto date. We then explore if GNN models trained solely on binary mixture and\npure species data can also accurately predict the CMCs of ternary mixtures.\nFinally, we experimentally measure the CMC of 4 commercial surfactants that\ncontain up to four species and industrial relevant mixtures and find a very\ngood agreement between measured and predicted CMC values.",

In this paper, we\nconsider an electrified power-to-heat system which is designed to supply heat\nin form of superheated steam for industrial processes. The system consists of a\nhigh-temperature heat pump for heat supply, a wind turbine for power\ngeneration, a sensible thermal energy storage for storing excess heat and a\nsteam generator for providing steam.

We reformulate the problem of finding a spurious local minimum in terms of\nsyzygies of the underlying linear series, and also bring in topological tools\nto study this problem. When the variety $X$ is of minimal degree, there exist\nspurious second-order stationary points if and only if both the dimension and\nthe codimension of the variety are greater than one, answering a question by\nLegat, Yuan, and Parrilo. Moreover, for surfaces of minimal degree, we provide\nsufficient conditions to exclude points from being spurious local minima. In\nparticular, all second-order stationary points associated with infinite Gram\nmatrices on the Veronese surface, corresponding to ternary quartics, lie on the\nboundary and can be written as a binary quartic, up to a linear change of\ncoordinates, complementing work by Scheiderer on decompositions of ternary\nquartics as a sum of three squares.

    "abstract": "In this work, we explore the limitations of combining models by averaging\nintermediate features, referred to as model merging, and propose a new\ndirection for achieving collective model intelligence through what we call\ncompatible specialization. Current methods for model merging, such as parameter\nand feature averaging, struggle to effectively combine specialized models due\nto representational divergence during fine-tuning. As models specialize to\ntheir individual domains, their internal feature representations become\nincreasingly incompatible, leading to poor performance when attempting to merge\nthem for new tasks. We analyze this phenomenon using centered kernel alignment\n(CKA) and show that as models specialize, the similarity in their feature space\nstructure diminishes, hindering their capacity for collective use. To address\nthese challenges, we investigate routing-based merging strategies, which offer\nmore flexible methods for combining specialized models by dynamically routing\nacross different layers. This allows us to improve on existing methods by\ncombining features from multiple layers rather than relying on fixed,\nlayer-wise combinations. However, we find that these approaches still face\nlimitations when layers within models are representationally incompatible. Our\nfindings highlight the importance of designing new approaches for model merging\nthat operate on well-defined input and output spaces, similar to how humans\ncommunicate through language rather than intermediate neural activations.",

To cope with the\nhigh data rate of 3.5 TB/s from the detectors, multiple stages of compression\nare employed during data taking, the last one requiring full TPC tracking. This\ncompression chain is part of the synchronous (online) processing and largely\nrelies on GPU computing to reduce the data rate to 170 GB/s. After the data\ntaking, a second phase called asynchronous (offline) processing is performed,\nwhere the compressed data are read and a full global reconstruction is\nperformed, which results in the production of data that can be analysed. When\nthe online computing farm is not fully utilized for online processing, it is\ncapable of running the offline reconstruction leveraging GPUs, which proved to\nspeed up also this phase. ALICE is making significant efforts to offload more\nof the asynchronous reconstruction to GPUs, to speed up the overall execution\ntime and efficiently use as much GPU computing resources as possible. This talk\nwill focus on the performance that GPUs have provided in Run 3 for the ALICE\nexperiment, both for online and offline reconstruction.

A more comprehensive description\nof the LC intrusion and LCE separations was obtained by considering the upper\neastern or western YCT (whose magnitudes are determined by the longitudinal\ndisplacements of the Yucatan Current's core), a perspective not evident when\nconsidering the upper total YCT; specifically, the eastern YCT provides the\nmost meaningful description of the studied processes. Atmospheric forcing\nmainly affects the extended stage of the LC by creating a higher dispersion in\nthe YCT and LC circulation values in comparison when considering only ocean\ndynamics. For the long-term analysis, standardized indexes that integrate the\ndaily values of the eastern YCT and LC circulation in time were used; their\ntemporal propagation and persistence (the changes of their characteristics from\nshort to long time scales) were studied. Intrinsic ocean dynamics produces a\npersistent YCT and LC intrusion behavior and consistent LCE separation patterns\nfrom daily to 5-month scales. The atmospheric forcing effects are more\nemphasized on the LC intrusion and LCE separations than on the YCT: the YCT\npersistence is maintained but not that of the LC intrusion. An increased\noccurrence of LCE separations with low or moderate LC intrusion is expected due\nto climate change. Using the standardized indexes of the LC metrics to\nconstruct a predictive model of the LC intrusion and LCE separations using only\ncurrent and past LC information is proposed for future research.",

They are particularly useful in\nareas such as network analysis and geometry processing, as computation of a GW\ndistance involves solving for registration between the objects which minimizes\ngeometric distortion. Although GW distances have proven useful for various\napplications in the recent machine learning literature, it has been observed\nthat they are inherently sensitive to outlier noise and cannot accommodate\npartial matching. This has been addressed by various constructions building on\nthe GW framework; in this article, we focus specifically on a natural\nrelaxation of the GW optimization problem, introduced by Chapel et al., which\nis aimed at addressing exactly these shortcomings. Our goal is to understand\nthe theoretical properties of this relaxed optimization problem, from the\nviewpoint of metric geometry. While the relaxed problem fails to induce a\nmetric, we derive precise characterizations of how it fails the axioms of\nnon-degeneracy and triangle inequality. These observations lead us to define a\nnovel family of distances, whose construction is inspired by the Prokhorov and\nKy Fan distances, as well as by the recent work of Raghvendra et al.\\ on robust\nversions of classical Wasserstein distance. We show that our new distances\ndefine true metrics, that they induce the same topology as the GW distances,\nand that they enjoy additional robustness to perturbations.

Among these, the tensor product is arguably the most important,\nwhich can be considered as an extension of the tensor product from linear\nalgebra. However, Las Vergnas showed that the tensor product of two matroids\ndoes not always exist. Over the following four decades, matroid products\nremained surprisingly underexplored, regaining attention only in recent years\ndue to applications in tropical geometry and the limit theory of matroids.\n  In this paper, inspired by the concept of coupling in probability theory, we\nintroduce the notion of coupling for matroids -- or, more generally, for\nsubmodular set functions. This operation can be viewed as a relaxation of the\ntensor product. Unlike the tensor product, however, we prove that a coupling\nalways exists for any two submodular functions and can be chosen to be\nincreasing if the original functions are increasing. As a corollary, we show\nthat two matroids always admit a matroid coupling, leading to a novel operation\non matroids. Our construction is algorithmic, providing an oracle for the\ncoupling matroid through a polynomial number of oracle calls to the original\nmatroids.\n  We apply this construction to derive new necessary conditions for matroid\nrepresentability and establish connection between tensor products and\nIngleton's inequality.

Therefore, the recent discovery of electroreception\namong terrestrial arthropods motivates the investigation of floral electrics as\npart of their wider sensory ecology. We examine how a flower's morphology and\nmaterial properties produce and propagate detectable, ecologically relevant\nelectrical signals in several biologically inspired scenarios. As the\nelectrical field both interior and exterior to the flower must be solved for,\nwe develop an extension of the two-dimensional AAA-least squares algorithm for\nsolving such two-domain electrostatics problems.

We analyze waves observed in an electron-scale\nplasma mixing layer at the edge of the magnetospheric outflow. Using\nhigh-resolution 7.5 ms electron moments, we obtain an electron current density\nwith a Nyquist frequency of ~66 Hz, sufficient to resolve most of the lower\nhybrid drift wave power observed in the event. We then employ wavelet analysis\nto evaluate dJ.dE, which accounts for the phase differences between the\nfluctuating quantities. The analysis shows that the energy exchange is\nlocalized within the plasma mixing layer, and it is highly fluctuating, with\nenergy bouncing between waves and electrons throughout the analyzed time and\nfrequency range. However, the cumulative sum over time indicates a net energy\ntransfer from the waves to electrons. We observe an anomalous electron flow\ntoward the magnetosphere, consistent with diffusion and electron mixing. These\nresults indicate that waves and electrons interact dynamically to dissipate the\nexcess internal energy accumulated by sharp density gradients. We conclude that\nthe electron temperature profile within the plasma mixing layer is produced by\na combination of electron diffusion across the layer, as well as heating by\nlarge-scale parallel potential and lower hybrid drift waves.",

    "abstract": "The accuracy of face recognition systems has improved significantly in the\npast few years, thanks to the large amount of data collected and advancements\nin neural network architectures. However, these large-scale datasets are often\ncollected without explicit consent, raising ethical and privacy concerns. To\naddress this, there have been proposals to use synthetic datasets for training\nface recognition models. Yet, such models still rely on real data to train the\ngenerative models and generally exhibit inferior performance compared to those\ntrained on real datasets. One of these datasets, DigiFace, uses a graphics\npipeline to generate different identities and intra-class variations without\nusing real data in model training. However, the performance of this approach is\npoor on face recognition benchmarks, possibly due to the lack of realism in the\nimages generated by the graphics pipeline. In this work, we introduce a novel\nframework for realism transfer aimed at enhancing the realism of synthetically\ngenerated face images. Our method leverages the large-scale face foundation\nmodel, and we adapt the pipeline for realism enhancement. By integrating the\ncontrollable aspects of the graphics pipeline with our realism enhancement\ntechnique, we generate a large amount of realistic variations, combining the\nadvantages of both approaches. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that\nmodels trained using our enhanced dataset significantly improve the performance\nof face recognition systems over the baseline.

Our primary goal is to investigate the relationship\nbetween model capacity and its OOD detection performance. Specifically, we aim\nto answer the following question: Does the Double Descent phenomenon manifest\nin post-hoc OOD detection? This question is crucial, as it can reveal whether\noverparameterization, which is already known to benefit generalization, can\nalso enhance OOD detection. Despite the growing interest in these topics by the\nclassic supervised machine learning community, this intersection remains\nunexplored for OOD detection.

We here simulate the\neffect of the interaction of an external perturbation on a magnetic null in the\nsolar corona which results in the formation of a current sheet (CS). Once the\nCS undergoes a sufficient extension in its length and squeezing of its width,\nit may go unstable to the formation of multiple impulsive plasmoids.\nEventually, the plasmoids merge with one another to form larger plasmoids\nand/or are expelled from the sheet. The formation, motion and coalescence of\nplasmoids with each other and with magnetic Y-points at the outer periphery of\nthe extended CS are found to generate wave-like perturbations. An analysis of\nthe resultant quasi-periodic variations of pressure, density, velocity and\nmagnetic field at certain locations in the model corona indicate that these\nwaves are predominantly fast-mode magnetoacoustic waves. For typical coronal\nparameters, the resultant propagating waves carry an energy flux of\n$\\mathrm{10^{5}~\\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}}$ to a large distance of at least\n60 Mm away from the current sheet.

We aim to investigate the kinematics, structure, and stellar\npopulations of the KDC residing in the early-type galaxy NGC 4494 to understand\nits formation.\n  Methods. We used long-slit spectroscopic data obtained with the FORS2\ninstrument on the VLT to measure the stellar kinematics and stellar\npopulations. We performed a spectroscopic decomposition to disentangle the\nproperties of the KDC from those of the host galaxy and construct models of the\nobserved rotation curve.\n  Results. The rotation curve is characterized by two symmetric dips at |R|=6\",\nwhere the rotation velocity drops to zero. Contrary to previous studies that\nexplained the decoupled structure as a rapidly co-rotating disk, our analysis\nclearly shows that it is a counter-rotating component. A counter-rotating core\nis indeed needed to reproduce the observed dip in the velocity curve. The\nproperties of the stellar populations of the decoupled core and the main galaxy\nare very similar: old stars (12-13 Gyr) with slightly super-solar metallicities\n(0<[Z/H]<0.15 dex) and alpha-enhanced (0 <[alpha/Fe]< 0.15 dex).\n  Conclusions. Our results indicate that the counter-rotating component is a\ndisk of about 1 kpc in diameter that is obscured by dust in the central 0.12\nkpc. The properties of its stellar populations suggest that it formed from the\nsame material as the main stellar body of the host galaxy. This could have\nhappened via internal processes such as the precession of a pre-existing\nrotating core, or, alternatively, via gas accretion in retrograde orbits\nfollowed by star formation. In the latter scenario, the accretion event\noccurred almost simultaneously with the formation of the galaxy, using material\nthat had the same composition as the gas from which the stars in the main body\nof the galaxy were formed.",

    "abstract": "Continual learning aims to incrementally acquire new concepts in data streams\nwhile resisting forgetting previous knowledge. With the rise of powerful\npre-trained models (PTMs), there is a growing interest in training incremental\nlearning systems using these foundation models, rather than learning from\nscratch. Existing works often view PTMs as a strong initial point and directly\napply parameter-efficient tuning (PET) in the first session for adapting to\ndownstream tasks. In the following sessions, most methods freeze model\nparameters for tackling forgetting issues. However, applying PET directly to\ndownstream data cannot fully explore the inherent knowledge in PTMs.\nAdditionally, freezing the parameters in incremental sessions hinders models'\nplasticity to novel concepts not covered in the first session. To solve the\nabove issues, we propose a Slow And Fast parameter-Efficient tuning (SAFE)\nframework. In particular, to inherit general knowledge from foundation models,\nwe include a transfer loss function by measuring the correlation between the\nPTM and the PET-applied model. After calibrating in the first session, the slow\nefficient tuning parameters can capture more informative features, improving\ngeneralization to incoming classes. Moreover, to further incorporate novel\nconcepts, we strike a balance between stability and plasticity by fixing slow\nefficient tuning parameters and continuously updating the fast ones.\nSpecifically, a cross-classification loss with feature alignment is proposed to\ncircumvent catastrophic forgetting. During inference, we introduce an\nentropy-based aggregation strategy to dynamically utilize the complementarity\nin the slow and fast learners.

Given a\nsample of stars with similar normalized SEDs, the outliers in luminosity\ndistribution can be considered microlensing events by excluding other possible\nvariations. In this case, we can select microlensing events from archive data\nrather than time domain monitoring the sky, which we describe as static\nmicrolensing. Following this concept, we collect the data from Gaia DR3 and\nSDSS DR16 from the northern galactic cap at high galactic latitudes.

To\naddress this challenge, we propose learning to predict \\emph{multiple} diverse\ninitial solutions given parameters that define the problem instance. We\nintroduce two strategies for utilizing multiple initial solutions: (i) a\nsingle-optimizer approach, where the most promising initial solution is chosen\nusing a selection function, and (ii) a multiple-optimizers approach, where\nseveral optimizers, potentially run in parallel, are each initialized with a\ndifferent solution, with the best solution chosen afterward. Notably, by\nincluding a default initialization among predicted ones, the cost of the final\noutput is guaranteed to be equal or lower than with the default initialization.\nWe validate our method on three optimal control benchmark tasks: cart-pole,\nreacher, and autonomous driving, using different optimizers: DDP, MPPI, and\niLQR.

Historically,\nthe area law has been well understood under two critical assumptions:\nshort-range interactions and bounded local energy. However, extending the area\nlaw beyond these assumptions has been a long-sought goal in quantum many-body\ntheory. This challenge is especially pronounced in interacting boson systems,\nwhere the breakdown of the bounded energy assumption is universal and poses\nsignificant difficulties. In this work, we prove the area law for\none-dimensional interacting boson systems including the long-range\ninteractions. Our model encompasses the Bose-Hubbard class and the $\\phi4$\nclass, two of the most fundamental models in quantum condensed matter physics,\nstatistical mechanics, and high-energy physics. This result achieves the\nresolution of the area law that incorporates both the challenges of unbounded\nlocal energy and long-range interactions in a unified manner. Additionally, we\nestablish an efficiency-guaranteed approximation of the quantum ground states\nusing Matrix Product States (MPS). These results significantly advance our\nunderstanding of quantum complexity by offering new insights into how bosonic\nparameters and interaction decay rates influence entanglement. Our findings\nprovide crucial theoretical foundations for simulating long-range interacting\ncold atomic systems, which are central to modern quantum technologies, and pave\nthe way for more efficient simulation techniques in future quantum\napplications.",

On the experimental side, single\ncrystals grown by the floating-zone method were examined by means of X-ray\ndiffraction, as well as transport and thermal techniques. Density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations founded on the experimentally determined parent and\nCDW-modified crystal structures provide details of electronic and phononic\nstructures as well as electron-phonon coupling and resolve changes inflicted\nupon entering the different CDW phases. Thereby, contrasting effects of\nsubsequently emerging CDW states characterized by incommensurate q_{1ic} and\ncommensurate q_{2c} modulation vectors are revealed. The former state,\non-setting below T_{1ic}~ 305 K, weakly modifies the electronic structure by\nopening an almost isotropic gap on a minor part of the Fermi surface (FS). The\nlatter phase, which takes over below T_{2c}~ 272 K has a more pronounced impact\non physical properties via a decomposition of larger parts of the FS. These\ndissimilar behaviors are directly reflected in the electronic transport\nanisotropy, which is significantly weakened in the q_{2c}-type CDW state. As\nrevealed by our DFT studies, CDW phases are very close in energy and their\norigin is directly related to the anisotropy of electron-phonon coupling, which\nis linked to a specific orbital character of related FS sheets. Specific heat\nand thermal expansion studies reveal a nearly reversible first-order phase\ntransition at around T_{2c}~ 272 K, where both CDW phases co-exist within a\nT-interval of about 10 K.",

Essentially, this part of\nthe method controls that outliers that require too much training time are less\nfrequently used.

Several studies have theorized that these signals\nwere produced by seiches which formed after two landslide generated\nmega-tsunamis in an East-Greenland fjord. This theory is supported by seismic\ninversions, and analytical and numerical modeling, but no direct observations\nhave been made -- until now. Using data from the new Surface Water Ocean\nTopography mission, we present the first observations of this phenomenon. By\nruling out other oceanographic processes, we validate the seiche theory of\nprevious authors and independently estimate its initial amplitude at 7.9 m\nusing Bayesian machine learning and seismic data. This study demonstrates the\nvalue of satellite altimetry for studying extreme events, while also\nhighlighting the need for specialized methods to address the altimetric data's\nlimitations, namely temporal sparsity.

For many infectious pathogens, infection dynamics may\nalso show periodic outbreaks corresponding to a limit cycle in phase space. One\nway to reproduce oscillations in SIRS models is to include a non-exponential\ndwell-time distribution in the recovered state. Here, we study a SIRS model\nwith a step-function-like kernel for the immunity time, mapping out the model's\nfull phase diagram. Using the kernel series framework, we are able to identify\nthe onset of periodic outbreaks when successively broadening the step-width. We\nfurther investigate the shape of the outbreaks, finding that broader steps\ncause more sinusoidal oscillations while more uniform immunity time\ndistributions are related to sharper outbreaks occurring after extended periods\nof low infection activity.\n  Our main results concern recovery distributions characterized by a single\ndominant timescale. We also consider recovery distributions with two\ntimescales, which may be observed when two or more distinct recovery processes\nco-exist. Surprisingly, two qualitatively different limit cycles are found to\nbe stable in this case, with only one of the two limit cycles emerging via a\nstandard supercritical Hopf bifurcation.",

This paper introduces Multi-Scale Representation\nConcatenation, a set of composable procedures that transform arbitrary\nsingle-scale EO-based CATE estimation algorithms into multi-scale ones. We\nbenchmark the performance of Multi-Scale Representation Concatenation on a CATE\nestimation pipeline that combines Vision Transformer (ViT) models (which encode\nimages) with Causal Forests (CFs) to obtain CATE estimates from those\nencodings.

We\npresent the eTraj.jl program package, designed to implement established\nclassical/semiclassical trajectory-based methods to determine the photoelectron\nmomentum distribution resulting from strong-field ionization of both atoms and\nmolecules. The program operates within a unified theoretical framework that\nseparates the trajectory-based computation into two stages: initial-condition\npreparation and trajectory evolution. For initial-condition preparation, we\nprovide several methods, including the Strong-Field Approximation with\nSaddle-Point Approximation (SFA-SPA), SFA-SPA with Non-adiabatic Expansion\n(SFA-SPANE), and the Ammosov-Delone-Krainov theory (ADK), with atomic and\nmolecular variants, as well as the Weak-Field Asymptotic Theory (WFAT) for\nmolecules. For trajectory evolution, available options are Classical Trajectory\nMonte-Carlo (CTMC), which employs purely classical electron trajectories, and\nthe Quantum Trajectory Monte-Carlo (QTMC) and Semi-Classical Two-Step model\n(SCTS), which include the quantum phase during trajectory evolution. The\nprogram is a versatile, efficient, flexible, and out-of-the-box solution for\ntrajectory-based simulations for strong-field ionization. It is designed with\nuser-friendliness in mind and is expected to serve as a valuable and powerful\ntool for the community of strong-field physics.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, trace generation has emerged as a significant challenge\nwithin the Process Mining community. Deep Learning (DL) models have\ndemonstrated accuracy in reproducing the features of the selected processes.\nHowever, current DL generative models are limited in their ability to adapt the\nlearned distributions to generate data samples based on specific conditions or\nattributes. This limitation is particularly significant because the ability to\ncontrol the type of generated data can be beneficial in various contexts,\nenabling a focus on specific behaviours, exploration of infrequent patterns, or\nsimulation of alternative 'what-if' scenarios. In this work, we address this\nchallenge by introducing a conditional model for process data generation based\non a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). Conditional models offer\ncontrol over the generation process by tuning input conditional variables,\nenabling more targeted and controlled data generation. Unlike other domains,\nCVAE for process mining faces specific challenges due to the multiperspective\nnature of the data and the need to adhere to control-flow rules while ensuring\ndata variability. Specifically, we focus on generating process executions\nconditioned on control flow and temporal features of the trace, allowing us to\nproduce traces for specific, identified sub-processes. The generated traces are\nthen evaluated using common metrics for generative model assessment, along with\nadditional metrics to evaluate the quality of the conditional generation",

The sample of void galaxies that we use in this study is based\non the catalogue of cosmic voids and void galaxies in the SDSS-DR7.

We analyse the fraction of galaxies\nof each morphology type as a function of the void-centric distance, the size of\nthe voids, and the density of galaxies in each void. There is a higher\nabundance of late-type galaxies with respect to early-type galaxies within\nvoids, which remains nearly constant from the inner to the outer part of the\nvoids. We do not find any dependence of the fraction of early- and late-type\ngalaxies with respect to the size of the voids or the number-density of\ngalaxies in the voids. Galaxies in voids follow the morphology-density\nrelation, in the sense that the majority of the galaxies in voids (the most\nunder-dense large-scale environments) are late-type galaxies.

The physical processes responsible for the evolution from\nlate towards earlier types (such as external environmental quenching) are not\nsufficiently effective in voids or so slow (internal secular quenching) that\ntheir contributions do not appear in the morphology-density relation.",

We show that this\nperiastron passage was characterised by the early flaring of X-rays before the\nperiastron passage and GeV emission after the periastron passage, which can be\nexplained by a larger size of the decretion disk as supported by the optical\nobservations. The structure of the GeV flare is also in agreement with the\ndisruption of the large dense disk.

To this\nend, we propose a supervised transfer learning framework for fault diagnosis in\nwind turbines that operates in an Anomaly-Space. This space was created using\nSCADA data and vibration data and was built and provided to us by our research\npartner. Data within the Anomaly-Space can be interpreted as anomaly scores for\neach component in the wind turbine, making each value intuitive to understand.\nWe conducted cross-domain evaluation on the train set using popular supervised\nclassifiers like Random Forest, Light-Gradient-Boosting-Machines and Multilayer\nPerceptron as metamodels for the diagnosis of bearing and sensor faults. The\nMultilayer Perceptron achieved the highest classification performance. This\nmodel was then used for a final evaluation in our test set. The results show,\nthat the proposed framework is able to detect cross-domain faults in the test\nset with a high degree of accuracy by using one single classifier, which is a\nsignificant asset to the diagnostic team.",

    "abstract": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a promising approach to extracting features\nfrom neural networks, enabling model interpretability as well as causal\ninterventions on model internals. SAEs generate sparse feature representations\nusing a sparsifying activation function that implicitly defines a set of\ntoken-feature matches. We frame the token-feature matching as a resource\nallocation problem constrained by a total sparsity upper bound. For example,\nTopK SAEs solve this allocation problem with the additional constraint that\neach token matches with at most $k$ features. In TopK SAEs, the $k$ active\nfeatures per token constraint is the same across tokens, despite some tokens\nbeing more difficult to reconstruct than others. To address this limitation, we\npropose two novel SAE variants, Feature Choice SAEs and Mutual Choice SAEs,\nwhich each allow for a variable number of active features per token. Feature\nChoice SAEs solve the sparsity allocation problem under the additional\nconstraint that each feature matches with at most $m$ tokens. Mutual Choice\nSAEs solve the unrestricted allocation problem where the total sparsity budget\ncan be allocated freely between tokens and features. Additionally, we introduce\na new auxiliary loss function, $\\mathtt{aux\\_zipf\\_loss}$, which generalises\nthe $\\mathtt{aux\\_k\\_loss}$ to mitigate dead and underutilised features.

We analyse the radio data for an apparently\nasymmetric radio source 4C70.19, which is associated with the giant elliptical\ngalaxy NGC6048. The source shows distorted radio jets and lobes, one of which\nbends by 180 degrees. The aim of our study is to explain the nature of the\nobserved distortions. We used LOFAR, Effelsberg, and VLA radio data in a wide\nrange of frequencies. At high frequencies, we also used radio polarimetry to\nstudy the properties of the magnetic fields. Additionally, we made use of\noptical, infra-red, and X-ray data. Polarisation data suggest shearing of the\nmagnetic fields at points where the jets bend. The low-frequency LOFAR map at\n145 MHz, as well as the sensitive single-dish Effelsberg map at 8.35 GHz,\nreveal previously undetected diffuse emission around the source. The rotation\nmeasure (RM) derived from the polarimetric data allowed us to estimate the\ndensity of the medium surrounding the source, which agrees with typical\ndensities of the intergalactic medium or the outer parts of insterstellar\nhalos. We propose that the southern jet is bent in the same manner as the\nnorthern one, but that it is inclined to the sky plane. Both these bends are\nlikely caused by the orbital motion within the galaxy group, as well as\ninteractions with the intergalactic medium. Our analyses suggest that, despite\nits complex morphology, 4C70.19 seems to be intrinsically symmetric with a\nphysical extent of up to 600 kpc, and that the diffuse emission detected in our\nhigh-sensitivity maps is related to radio plumes that are expanding behind the\nsource.",

While the development of machine learning algorithms for\nthis task has seen significant success, the prevailing approaches, which\npredominantly employ a discriminative formulation, frequently encounter the\nerror accumulation issue and often fail to capture the extensive variety of\nplausible sequences. To fill these gaps, we propose Bridge-IF, a generative\ndiffusion bridge model for inverse folding, which is designed to learn the\nprobabilistic dependency between the distributions of backbone structures and\nprotein sequences. Specifically, we harness an expressive structure encoder to\npropose a discrete, informative prior derived from structures, and establish a\nMarkov bridge to connect this prior with native sequences. During the inference\nstage, Bridge-IF progressively refines the prior sequence, culminating in a\nmore plausible design. Moreover, we introduce a reparameterization perspective\non Markov bridge models, from which we derive a simplified loss function that\nfacilitates more effective training. We also modulate protein language models\n(PLMs) with structural conditions to precisely approximate the Markov bridge\nprocess, thereby significantly enhancing generation performance while\nmaintaining parameter-efficient training. Extensive experiments on\nwell-established benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge-IF predominantly surpasses\nexisting baselines in sequence recovery and excels in the design of plausible\nproteins with high foldability.

We use the age of information at query (QAoI) to characterize the\nperformance of information freshness. Such a decision-making problem is\nnaturally modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), which, however, is\nprohibitively high to be solved optimally by the standard method due to the\ncurse of dimensionality. To address this issue, we employ Whittle index\napproach, which allows us to decouple the original MDP into multiple sub-MDPs\nby relaxing the scheduling constraints. However, the binary Markovian query\narrival process results in a bi-dimensional state and complex state transitions\nwithin each sub-MDP, making it challenging to verify Whittle indexability using\nconventional methods. After a thorough analysis of the sub-MDP's structure, we\nshow that it is unichain and its optimal policy follows a threshold-type\nstructure. This facilitates the verification of Whittle indexability of the\nsub-MDP by employing an easy-to-verify condition. Subsequently, the\nsteady-state probability distributions of the sub-MDP under different\nthreshold-type policies are analyzed, constituting the analytical expressions\nof different Whittle indices in terms of the expected average QAoI and\nscheduling time of the sub-MDP. Building on these, we devise an efficient\nalgorithm to calculate Whittle indices for the formulated sub-MDPs.

Aside from task-specific information, EEG signals\nalso contain rich private information, e.g., user identity, emotion, disorders,\netc., which should be protected. Approach: We show for the first time that\nadding user-wise perturbations can make identity information in EEG\nunlearnable. We propose four types of user-wise privacy-preserving\nperturbations, i.e., random noise, synthetic noise, error minimization noise,\nand error maximization noise. After adding the proposed perturbations to EEG\ntraining data, the user identity information in the data becomes unlearnable,\nwhile the BCI task information remains unaffected.

In finite element\nmethods for incompressible flows, the most popular approach to allow\nequal-order velocity-pressure interpolation are residual-based stabilisations.\nFor low-order elements, however, the viscous part of that residual cannot be\napproximated, often compromising accuracy. Assuming slightly more regularity on\nthe viscosity field, we can construct stabilisation methods that fully\napproximate the residual, regardless of the polynomial order of the finite\nelement spaces. This work analyses two variants of this fully consistent\napproach, with the generalised Stokes system as a model problem. We prove\nunique solvability and derive expressions for the stabilisation parameter,\ngeneralising some classical results for constant viscosity.

Moreover, our proposed model yields a\nparsimonious representation with fewer parameters than matrix-based approaches.\nUnlike these methods, which impose low-rankness uniformly across all states,\nour tensor method accounts for the multi-dimensionality of the state space.

Beyond granting immune escape, empirical\nevidence also suggests that mutations of viruses might increase their\ninter-host transmissibility. While both mechanisms are well-studied\nindividually, their combined effects on viral endemicity remain to be explored.\nHere we propose a minimal eco-evolutionary framework to simulate epidemic\noutbreaks generated by pathogens evolving both their transmissibility and\nimmune escape. Our findings uncover a very rich phenomenology arising from the\ncomplex interplay between both evolutionary pathways and the underlying\ncontagion dynamics. We first show that contagions at the population level\nconstrain the effective evolution of the virus, accelerating the increase in\ntransmissibility in the first epidemic wave while favoring antigenic variation\nin the transition to the endemic phase. Our results also reveal that accounting\nfor both evolutionary pathways changes the features of the viruses more prone\nto become endemic. While chances for endemicity increase with infectiousness of\nthe wild-type variant for viruses not evolving their transmissibility, a\nnon-monotonic behavior is observed when the latter mechanism is included,\nfavoring less transmissible viruses and impairing those ones with intermediate\ninfectiousness.",

Modeling an MRS is a crucial\naspect of designing the proper system architecture, because this model can be\nused to simulate and measure the performance of the proposed architecture.\nHowever, an MRS solution architecture modeling is a very difficult problem, as\nit contains many dependent behaviors that dynamically change due to the current\nstatus of the overall system. In this paper, we introduce a general purpose MRS\ncase study, where the humans initiate requests that are achieved by the\navailable robots. These requests require different plans that use the current\ncapabilities of the available robots. After proposing an architecture that\ndefines the solution components, three steps are followed. First is modeling\nthese components via Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) language. BPMN\nprovides a graphical notation to precisely represent the behaviors of every\ncomponent, which is an essential need to model the solution. Second is to\nsimulate these components behaviors and interaction in form of software agents.\nJava Agent DEvelopment (JADE) middleware has been used to develop and simulate\nthe proposed model. JADE is based on a reactive agent approach, therefore it\ncan dynamically represent the interaction among the solution components.\nFinally is to analyze the performance of the solution by defining a number of\nquantitative measurements, which can be obtained while simulating the system\nmodel in JADE middleware, therefore the solution can be analyzed and compared\nto another architecture.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has achieved great success in electroencephalogram (EEG)\nbased brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Most existing BCI studies focused on\nimproving the decoding accuracy, with only a few considering the adversarial\nsecurity. Although many adversarial defense approaches have been proposed in\nother application domains such as computer vision, previous research showed\nthat their direct extensions to BCIs degrade the classification accuracy on\nbenign samples. This phenomenon greatly affects the applicability of\nadversarial defense approaches to EEG-based BCIs. To mitigate this problem, we\npropose alignment-based adversarial training (ABAT), which performs EEG data\nalignment before adversarial training. Data alignment aligns EEG trials from\ndifferent domains to reduce their distribution discrepancies, and adversarial\ntraining further robustifies the classification boundary. The integration of\ndata alignment and adversarial training can make the trained EEG classifiers\nsimultaneously more accurate and more robust. Experiments on five EEG datasets\nfrom two different BCI paradigms (motor imagery classification, and event\nrelated potential recognition), three convolutional neural network classifiers\n(EEGNet, ShallowCNN and DeepCNN) and three different experimental settings\n(offline within-subject cross-block/-session classification, online\ncross-session classification, and pre-trained classifiers) demonstrated its\neffectiveness. It is very intriguing that adversarial attacks, which are\nusually used to damage BCI systems, can be used in ABAT to simultaneously\nimprove the model accuracy and robustness.",

However, the rapid development of foundational LLMs such as\nthe non-reasoning model GPT-4o and the reasoning model o1 raises questions\nabout the continued effectiveness of these prompt engineering techniques. This\npaper presents an extensive empirical study that reevaluates various prompt\nengineering techniques within the context of these advanced LLMs. Focusing on\nthree representative SE tasks, i.e., code generation, code translation, and\ncode summarization, we assess whether prompt engineering techniques still yield\nimprovements with advanced models, the actual effectiveness of reasoning models\ncompared to non-reasoning models, and whether the benefits of using these\nadvanced models justify their increased costs. Our findings reveal that prompt\nengineering techniques developed for earlier LLMs may provide diminished\nbenefits or even hinder performance when applied to advanced models. In\nreasoning LLMs, the ability of sophisticated built-in reasoning reduces the\nimpact of complex prompts, sometimes making simple zero-shot prompting more\neffective. Furthermore, while reasoning models outperform non-reasoning models\nin tasks requiring complex reasoning, they offer minimal advantages in tasks\nthat do not need reasoning and may incur unnecessary costs. Based on our study,\nwe provide practical guidance for practitioners on selecting appropriate prompt\nengineering techniques and foundational LLMs, considering factors such as task\nrequirements, operational costs, and environmental impact.

    "abstract": "The symbiotic X-ray binary GX 1+4 possesses a number of peculiar properties\nthat have been studied since the early 1970s. In particular, the orbital period\nhas been a point of debate for many years, until radial velocity measurements\nwere able to settle the debate. These radial velocity findings have so far not\nbeen confirmed using X-ray data, even though multiple factors would cause a\nperiodic variation on the same timescale as the orbital period at these\nenergies. Because the orbit of GX 1+4 is eccentric and not seen face-on,\nchanges in the accretion rate and column density along the line of sight could\ncause a periodic variation in the spin-frequency measurements, X-ray light\ncurves, and hardness ratios of the source. Furthermore, for a high inclination\nof the orbital plane, the neutron star could be eclipsed by the companion,\nwhich would lead to periodic decreases in brightness. We used data from a\nnumber of different X-ray telescopes to search directly for periodicity by\napplying the Lomb-Scargle and epoch-folding approaches to long-term light-curve\nand spin-frequency measurement data of the source. We support our findings\nusing folded light curves, hardness ratios, and images. We find that our\nresults agree with the radial velocity findings, and we form a self-consistent\nmodel that is supported by folded hardness-ratios and light curves. We find\nthat the source is clearly detected in X-rays during the predicted eclipse.\nMotivated by this absence of an eclipse in the system, we constrain the\ninclination of the system to $\\sim 76^\\circ-84^\\circ$ and the mass of the\nneutron star in the system to $\\sim1.23M_\\odot - 1.45M_\\odot$ using the\nconstraints on the red giant mass and surface gravity provided in the\nliterature. Furthermore, we constrain the radius of the red giant to $\\sim\n60R_\\odot - 150R_\\odot$.",

    "abstract": "Railway Turnout Machines (RTMs) are mission-critical components of the\nrailway transportation infrastructure, responsible for directing trains onto\ndesired tracks. For safety assurance applications, especially in early-warning\nscenarios, RTM faults are expected to be detected as early as possible on a\ncontinuous 7x24 basis. However, limited emphasis has been placed on distributed\nmodel inference frameworks that can meet the inference latency and reliability\nrequirements of such mission critical fault diagnosis systems. In this paper,\nan edge-cloud collaborative early-warning system is proposed to enable\nreal-time and downtime-tolerant fault diagnosis of RTMs, providing a new\nparadigm for the deployment of models in safety-critical scenarios. Firstly, a\nmodular fault diagnosis model is designed specifically for distributed\ndeployment, which utilizes a hierarchical architecture consisting of the prior\nknowledge module, subordinate classifiers, and a fusion layer for enhanced\naccuracy and parallelism. Then, a cloud-edge collaborative framework leveraging\npipeline parallelism, namely CEC-PA, is developed to minimize the overhead\nresulting from distributed task execution and context exchange by strategically\npartitioning and offloading model components across cloud and edge.\nAdditionally, an election consensus mechanism is implemented within CEC-PA to\nensure system robustness during coordinator node downtime. Comparative\nexperiments and ablation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed distributed fault diagnosis approach. Our ensemble-based fault\ndiagnosis model achieves a remarkable 97.4% accuracy on a real-world dataset\ncollected by Nanjing Metro in Jiangsu Province, China.

One fundamental\nlimitation is the nature of the cross-entropy (CE) loss, which assumes a\nnominal scale and thus cannot convey proximity between generated number tokens.\nIn response, we here present a regression-like loss that operates purely on\ntoken level. Our proposed Number Token Loss (NTL) comes in two flavors and\nminimizes either the $L_p$ norm or the Wasserstein distance between the\nnumerical values of the real and predicted number tokens. NTL can easily be\nadded to any language model and extend the CE objective during training without\nruntime overhead. We evaluate the proposed scheme on various mathematical\ndatasets and find that it consistently improves performance in math-related\ntasks. In a direct comparison on a regression task, we find that NTL can match\nthe performance of a regression head, despite operating on token level.\nFinally, we scale NTL up to 3B parameter models and observe improved\nperformance, demonstrating its potential for seamless integration into LLMs. We\nhope to inspire LLM developers to improve their pretraining objectives and\ndistribute NTL as a minimalistic and lightweight PyPI package $ntloss$:\nhttps://github.com/ai4sd/number-token-loss.

Using the proposed method, twenty pulse pairs having\nstatistical power at 5 to 10 standard deviations, and one pulse pair at 22\nstandard deviations of mean shift of pulse pair count, were observed in the\nprior celestial direction range, while using other celestial directions as an\nexperimental comparison group. High levels of standard deviations of pulse pair\ncount mean shift, observed in this 92 day experiment, imply the falsification\nof a Gaussian noise hypothesis. Alternate and auxiliary hypotheses, and further\nexperiments, are sought to try to explain the narrow bandwidth pulsed signals.",

    "abstract": "Future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments are primarily targeting\na detection of the primordial $B$-mode polarisation. The faintness of this\nsignal requires exquisite control of systematic effects which may bias the\nmeasurements. In this work, we derive requirements on the relative calibration\naccuracy of the overall polarisation gain ($\\Delta g_\\nu$) for LiteBIRD\nexperiment, through the application of the blind Needlet Internal Linear\nCombination (NILC) foreground-cleaning method. We find that minimum variance\ntechniques, as NILC, are less affected by gain calibration uncertainties than a\nparametric approach, which requires a proper modelling of these instrumental\neffects. The tightest constraints are obtained for frequency channels where the\nCMB signal is relatively brighter (166 GHz channel, $\\Delta {g}_\\nu \\approx\n0.16 \\%$), while, with a parametric approach, the strictest requirements were\non foreground-dominated channels. We then propagate gain calibration\nuncertainties, corresponding to the derived requirements, into all frequency\nchannels simultaneously. We find that the overall impact on the estimated $r$\nis lower than the required budget for LiteBIRD by almost a factor $5$. The\nadopted procedure to derive requirements assumes a simple Galactic model. We\ntherefore assess the robustness of obtained results against more realistic\nscenarios by injecting the gain calibration uncertainties, according to the\nrequirements, into LiteBIRD simulated maps and assuming intermediate- and\nhigh-complexity sky models. In this case, we employ the so-called\nMulti-Clustering NILC (MC-NILC) foreground-cleaning pipeline and obtain that\nthe impact of gain calibration uncertainties on $r$ is lower than the LiteBIRD\ngain systematics budget for the intermediate-complexity sky model. For the\nhigh-complexity case, instead, it would be necessary to tighten the\nrequirements by a factor $1.8$.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of text-to-image Diffusion Models has led to their\nwidespread public accessibility. However these models, trained on large\ninternet datasets, can sometimes generate undesirable outputs. To mitigate\nthis, approximate Machine Unlearning algorithms have been proposed to modify\nmodel weights to reduce the generation of specific types of images,\ncharacterized by samples from a ``forget distribution'', while preserving the\nmodel's ability to generate other images, characterized by samples from a\n``retain distribution''. While these methods aim to minimize the influence of\ntraining data in the forget distribution without extensive additional\ncomputation, we point out that they can compromise the model's integrity by\ninadvertently affecting generation for images in the retain distribution.\nRecognizing the limitations of FID and CLIPScore in capturing these effects, we\nintroduce a novel retention metric that directly assesses the perceptual\ndifference between outputs generated by the original and the unlearned models.\nWe then propose unlearning algorithms that demonstrate superior effectiveness\nin preserving model integrity compared to existing baselines. Given their\nstraightforward implementation, these algorithms serve as valuable benchmarks\nfor future advancements in approximate Machine Unlearning for Diffusion Models.",

Leveraging collaborative connections\namong such similar learners proves valuable in comprehending human learning.\nMotivated by the success of collaborative modeling in various domains, such as\nrecommender systems, we aim to investigate how collaborative signals among\nlearners contribute to the diagnosis of human cognitive states (i.e., knowledge\nproficiency) in the context of intelligent education. The primary challenges\nlie in identifying implicit collaborative connections and disentangling the\nentangled cognitive factors of learners for improved explainability and\ncontrollability in learner Cognitive Diagnosis (CD). However, there has been no\nwork on CD capable of simultaneously modeling collaborative and disentangled\ncognitive states.

Subsequently, a meticulously\ndesigned collaborative representation learning procedure captures collaborative\nsignals. It dynamically constructs a collaborative graph of learners by\niteratively searching for optimal neighbors in a context-aware manner. Using\nthe constructed graph, collaborative information is extracted through node\nrepresentation learning.

Adapters, one of the popular\ntechniques in parameter efficient transfer learning, facilitate the\nincorporation of AM flow into pretrained image models, mitigating the need for\nfull-finetuning.

Here, we propose\nand demonstrate a novel phase-change ferroelectric field effect transistor\n(PCFE-FET) for steep switching applications. Our gate stack is engineered as a\nferroelectric Lanthanum doped hafnium oxide (LHO) proximity coupled with Mott\ninsulator Ti$_x$O$_{2x-1}$(N$_y$) and is integrated onto a 2D MoS$_2$ channel.\nThe interplay of partial polarization switching in the ferroelectric LHO layer\nand reversible field-tunable metal-insulator transition (MIT) in\nTi$_x$O$_{2x-1}$(N$_y$) layer concomitantly triggers polar to non-polar phase\ntransition in the LHO layer between 200 and 220 K. This results in distinctive\nstep-like features in the channel current during DC measurements, and random\ncurrent fluctuations in high-speed measurements with slim anticlockwise\nhysteresis. Our devices show subthreshold slopes as steep as 25 mV/dec at 210\nK, breaking the Boltzmann limit. Our gate stack is also potentially tunable for\noperation at temperatures of interest, presenting innovative gate stack\nengineering approaches for low-power computing solutions.",

In the\ncurrent era of precision cosmology, an accurate estimation of this primordial\ntensor perturbation spectrum is crucial. Unlike the conventional assumption of\na constant equation of state during the perturbative reheating phase, in this\nwork we dynamically calculate the time evolution of the reheating equation of\nstate for different values of the inflaton decay rates including their possible\ntime-dependence in some cases. We further investigate its impact on the\nspectrum of primordial tensor perturbations, focusing on two different\ninflationary potentials of the E-model {\\alpha}-attractor class, with n=1 and\nn=3. Using this approach, our results indicate that the inflationary tensor\nperturbations can be enhanced (or suppressed) by a factor of {\\sim} 1.5-3\ncompared to standard calculations assuming a constant inflaton equation of\nstate. Such a variation arises because the evolution of the comoving horizon\ndiffers in the two approaches, causing different comoving momentum modes to\nre-enter the horizon at different times and undergo distinct evolutions.",

Existing label shift methods solely use\nunlabeled target samples to estimate the target label distribution, and do not\ninvolve them during the classifier training, resulting in suboptimal\nutilization of available information. One common solution is to directly blend\nthe source and target distributions during the training of the target\nclassifier.

To tackle this\ncrucial yet unexplored issue, we introduce the concept of aligned distribution\nmixture, showcasing its theoretical optimality and generalization error bounds.\nBy incorporating insights from generalization theory, we propose an innovative\nlabel shift framework named as Aligned Distribution Mixture (ADM). Within this\nframework, we enhance four typical label shift methods by introducing\nmodifications to the classifier training process.

Our experimental findings indicate that\nregression tasks, which are relatively unexplored from literature, can achieve\nsignificant fairness improvement through VFair regardless of any prior, whereas\nclassification tasks usually do not because of their quantized utility\nmeasurements. The implementation of our method is publicly available at\n\\url{https://github.com/wxqpxw/VFair}.",

In recent years, deep learning methods have been\napplied to the inversion of less than a dozen geometrical positions\ncorresponding to sensors glued to easily accessible articulators. It is\ntherefore impossible to know the shape of the whole tongue from root to tip. In\nthis work, we use high-quality real-time MRI data to track the contour of the\ntongue.

It is known that deep learning methods are\noften greatly degraded by domain or label shifts and are yet to be built in\nsuch a way as to be robust to unseen data or label distributions.

In this work, we\npropose to address these two challenges on the detection of clinically\nsignificant prostate cancer (csPCa) from bi-parametric MRI.

Performance of the model is based on two public (PI-CAI\nand Prostate158) and one private databases.

Second, we observe a\nperformance decrease for both fully supervised and weakly supervised models\nwhen tested on unseen data domains.

The models and how their constituent\ndimensions contribute to the determination of maturity levels were analyzed.\nThe summary highlights the diversity of the dimensions used and the fact that\ndigital maturity is only partially taken into account. What's more, most of\nthese models focus on the most recent maturity levels associated with\ninnovative or pioneering teachers. The models tend to exclude teachers who are\nnot digital users or who have a low level of digital use, but who are present\nin the French context. In the final part of the article, a proposal for a\nunified model of teachers' digital maturity, MUME, which addresses these two\nissues, is described, together with the preliminary results of a study aimed at\ndesigning a diagnostic method.",

We propose a novel view in which these\nperformative effects are modelled as push-forward measures. This general\nframework encompasses existing models and enables novel performative gradient\nestimation methods, leading to more efficient and scalable learning strategies.\nFor distribution shifts, unlike previous models which require full\nspecification of the data distribution, we only assume knowledge of the shift\noperator that represents the performative changes. This approach can also be\nintegrated into various change-of-variablebased models, such as VAEs or\nnormalizing flows. Focusing on classification with a linear-in-parameters\nperformative effect, we prove the convexity of the performative risk under a\nnew set of assumptions. Notably, we do not limit the strength of performative\neffects but rather their direction, requiring only that classification becomes\nharder when deploying more accurate models. In this case, we also establish a\nconnection with adversarially robust classification by reformulating the\nminimization of the performative risk as a min-max variational problem.\nFinally, we illustrate our approach on synthetic and real datasets.",

First, to detect new clusters we apply the newest\nmethods for the detection of clustering with the best available wide-field sky\nsurveys in the mid-infrared because they are the least affected by extinction.\nSecond, we address the question of cluster detection's completeness, for now\nlimiting it to the most massive star clusters.\n  Methods. This search is based on the mid-infrared Galactic Legacy Infrared\nMid Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE), to minimize the effect of dust\nextinction. The search Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure\n(OPTICS) clustering algorithm is applied to identify clusters, after excluding\nthe bluest, presumably foreground sources, to improve the cluster-to-field\ncontrast. The success rate for cluster identification is estimated with a\nsemi-empirical simulation that adds clusters, based on the real objects, to the\npoint source catalog, to be recovered later with the same search algorithm that\nwas used in the search for new cluster candidates. As a first step, this is\nlimited to the most massive star clusters with a total mass of 104 $M_\\odot$.\n  Results. Our automated search, combined with inspection of the\ncolor-magnitude diagrams and images yielded 659 cluster candidates; 106 of\nthese appear to have been previously identified, suggesting that a large hidden\npopulation of star clusters still exists in the inner Milky Way. However, the\nsearch for the simulated supermassive clusters achieves a recovery rate of 70\nto 95%, depending on the distance and extinction toward them.\n  Conclusions. The new candidates, if confirmed, indicate that the Milky Way\nstill harbors a sizeable population of still unknown clusters. However, they\nmust be objects of modest richness, because our simulation indicates that there\nis no substantial hidden population of supermassive clusters in the central\nregion of our Galaxy.",

The receiver, which seeks\nto detect all communication symbols and minimize the distortion over the\ncomputing signals, requires that only a fraction of the transmit power be\nallocated to the latter, therefore coming close to the ideal (but unattainable)\ncondition that computing is achieved \"for free\", without taking resources from\nthe communication system. The design leverages the Gaussian belief propagation\n(GaBP) framework relying only on element-wise scalar operations, which allows\nfor its use in massive settings, as demonstrated by simulation results\nincorporating up to 200 antennas and 200 UEs/EDs.

For instance, noise measurements\nshow that transport carriers in conventional superconductors have charge 2e.\nThe noise power also depends on junction type, distinguishing different\ntransport processes. Existing theories focus primarily on zero temperature shot\nnoise in tunnel junctions with conventional superconductors, where transport is\ncarried by quasiparticles and Cooper pairs. Here we develop a full counting\nstatistics theory for unconventional superconductor / normal metal junctions of\ndifferent types, incorporating the effect of thermal noise on the differential\nFano factor, the ratio of differential noise power and conductance. In these\njunctions there is a third type of transport carrier, surface Andreev bound\nstates. Our study reveals that junctions with dispersionless surface Andreev\nbound states exhibit negative differential Fano factor at finite temperatures.\nIn contrast, in the presence of dispersive surface Andreev bound states, the\nnoise power always increases with voltage, but there are local minima in the\ndifferential noise at those voltages corresponding to the extrema of the\nsurface Andreev bound state spectrum. For normal metals and conventional\nsuperconductors the voltage dependence of the differential Fano factor is\nsimilar in all types of junctions, including tunnel junctions and diffusive\nbarriers. However, significant differences arise with unconventional\nsuperconductors, making distinct junction types valuable tools for identifying\npairing symmetries. Our results also highlight the importance of finite\ntemperature effects in noise power measurements for potential unconventional\nsuperconductors, offering new means to determine pairing symmetries in\ntopological superconductors.",

Traditional\ngain-based solvers utilizing optical or photonic hardware typically represent\neach XY spin with a single complex field. These solvers often struggle with\nlarge energy barriers in complex landscapes, leading to relaxation into excited\nstates. CoVeGA addresses these limitations by employing two complex fields to\nrepresent each XY spin and dynamically evolving the energy landscape through\ntime-dependent annealing. Operating in a higher-dimensional space, CoVeGA\nbridges energy barriers in this expanded space during the continuous phase\nevolution, thus avoiding entrapment in local minima.

This paper introduces a Max-min\ncriterion with nonlinear constraints, leveraging optimization techniques to\nsimultaneously enable flexible multi-beam synthesis and directional suppression\nusing transmissive RIS. Firstly, a realistic model grounded in geometrical\noptics is introduced to characterize the input/output behaviors of transmissive\nRISs, effectively bridging the gap between explicit beamforming requirements\nand practical implementations.

By\nintroducing an auxiliary variable and applying the compensated convexity\ntransform, we successfully reformulate the original non-convex problem and\nobtain the optimal solution iteratively. This approach is readily applicable to\na wide range of constrained Max-min optimization problems. Finally, numerical\nsimulations and prototype experiments are conducted to validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework.

    "abstract": "A comprehensive investigation of the entanglement characteristics is carried\nout on tripartite spin-1/2 systems, examining prototypical tripartite states,\nthe thermal Heisenberg model, and the transverse field Ising model. The\nentanglement is computed using the R\\'enyi relative entropy. In the traditional\nR\\'enyi relative entropy, the generalization parameter $\\alpha$ can take values\nonly in the range $0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 2$ due to the requirements of joint\nconvexity of the measure. To use the R\\'enyi relative entropy over a wider\nrange of $\\alpha$, we use the sandwiched form which is jointly convex in the\nregime $0.5 \\leq \\alpha \\leq \\infty$. In prototypical tripartite states, we\nfind that GHZ states are monogamous, but surprisingly so are W states. On the\nother hand, star states exhibit polygamy, due to the higher level of purity of\nthe bipartite subsystems. For spin models, we study the dependence of\nentanglement on various parameters such as temperature, spin-spin interaction,\nand anisotropy, and identify regions where entanglement is the largest. The\nR\\'enyi parameter $\\alpha$ scales the amount of entanglement in the system. The\nentanglement measure based on the traditional and the sandwiched R\\'enyi\nrelative entropies obey the Araki-Lieb-Thirring inequality. In the Heisenberg\nmodels, namely the XYZ, XXZ, and XY models, the system is always monogamous.\nHowever, in the transverse field Ising model, the state is initially polygamous\nand becomes monogamous with temperature and coupling.",

This regulatory adjustment seeks to optimize the quality\nof natural light, a key factor for well-being. However, the application of a\ngeometric rule based on fixed proportions raises questions about the\nvariability of achievable lighting results and their suitability for\nresidential comfort needs. This study analyses the implementation of the\nregulation in two bedroom models, BR1 and BR2, selected as the typical and the\ndeepest, but with less than 4 meters and meeting the rest of the dimensional\nrequirements, respectively. Through simulations of the Daylight Factor (DF)\nusing window proportions of 1:1, 3:2, 2:1, and 1:2 under a CIE overcast sky\nmodel, the dispersion in the obtained natural lighting has been examined. Such\nanalysis allows for the quantification of lighting result variability within\nthe regulatory parameters, exploring the complexity of meeting lighting\nrequirements through an approach based exclusively on geometric proportions.\nAdditionally, the impact of architectural and urban variables such as building\nheight, the presence of courtyards, street width, and balcony depth has been\nconsidered. These factors, often overlooked in regulations and indirectly\nconsidered in D80/2022, play an important role in modulating natural light and\nlighting quality.

We carry out several\nconsequences and applications of these bounds, among them a computation of the\nparametrized TC of the unit tangent bundles of $(4m-1)$-spheres.",

    "abstract": "For a short hair black hole(BH) which circumvents the \"no-short-hair\"\ntheorem, it manifests intense hair behavior in the vicinity of the event\nhorizon, accompanied by remarkable quantum effects. These effects may carry\nimportant information about the internal structure and dynamical evolution of\nBHs, thereby providing a new perspective on the problem of black hole\ninformation loss. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the influence of the\nhair parameter $Q_m$ and the structural parameter $k$ of the short hair BH in\nan extreme mass ratio(EMR) system on the periodic orbits of particles and\ngravitational wave radiation. The results show that as $Q_m$ increases, the\nradius and angular momentum of the bound orbit decrease, and the $E-L$ space\nshifts to the left. An increase in $k$ weakens this trend. When $k$ takes a\nlarger value, the short hair BH and the Schwarzschild BH tend to be degenerate.\nCompared with the Schwarzschild BH, the bound orbit energy and angular momentum\nof the short hair black hole are reduced. Under the conditions of higher $Q_m$\nand lower $k$, the gravitational wave period is suppressed and the signal\namplitude is significantly increased. These results provide new observational\nmeans for distinguishing short hair BH from classical BH and offer new insights\nfor verifying the no-hair theorem and understanding the physical behavior near\nthe event horizon.",

    "abstract": "Capturing a video's meaning and critical concepts by analyzing the subtle\ndetails is a fundamental yet challenging task in video captioning. Identifying\nthe dominant emotional tone in a video significantly enhances the perception of\nits context. Despite a strong emphasis on video captioning, existing models\noften need to adequately address emotional themes, resulting in suboptimal\ncaptioning results. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel\nSemantic Processing and Emotion-informed video-Captioning Through Retrieval and\nUnderstanding Modalities (SPECTRUM) framework to empower the generation of\nemotionally and semantically credible captions. Leveraging our pioneering\nstructure, SPECTRUM discerns multimodal semantics and emotional themes using\nVisual Text Attribute Investigation (VTAI) and determines the orientation of\ndescriptive captions through a Holistic Concept-Oriented Theme (HCOT),\nexpressing emotionally-informed and field-acquainted references. They exploit\nvideo-to-text retrieval capabilities and the multifaceted nature of video\ncontent to estimate the emotional probabilities of candidate captions. Then,\nthe dominant theme of the video is determined by appropriately weighting\nembedded attribute vectors and applying coarse- and fine-grained emotional\nconcepts, which define the video's contextual alignment. Furthermore, using two\nloss functions, SPECTRUM is optimized to integrate emotional information and\nminimize prediction errors. Extensive experiments on the EmVidCap, MSVD, and\nMSRVTT video captioning datasets demonstrate that our model significantly\nsurpasses state-of-the-art methods.

Its\nstatistical analysis when the matrix to infer has a factorised structure with a\nrank growing proportionally to its dimension remains a challenge, except when\nit is rotationally invariant. In this case the information theoretic limits and\nan efficient Bayes-optimal denoising algorithm, called rotational invariant\nestimator [1,2], are known. Beyond this setting few results can be found. The\nreason is that the model is not a usual spin system because of the growing rank\ndimension, nor a matrix model (as appearing in high-energy physics) due to the\nlack of rotation symmetry, but rather a hybrid between the two. Here we make\nprogress towards the understanding of Bayesian matrix denoising when the signal\nis a factored matrix $XX^\\intercal$ that is not rotationally invariant. Monte\nCarlo simulations suggest the existence of a \\emph{denoising-factorisation\ntransition} separating a phase where denoising using the rotational invariant\nestimator remains Bayes-optimal due to universality properties of the same\nnature as in random matrix theory, from one where universality breaks down and\nbetter denoising is possible, though algorithmically hard. We argue that it is\nonly beyond the transition that factorisation, i.e., estimating $X$ itself,\nbecomes possible up to irresolvable ambiguities. On the theory side, we combine\nmean-field techniques in an interpretable multiscale fashion in order to access\nthe minimum mean-square error and mutual information. Interestingly, our\nalternative method yields equations reproducible by the replica approach of\n[3]. Using numerical insights, we delimit the portion of phase diagram where we\nconjecture the mean-field theory to be exact, and correct it using universality\nwhen it is not. Our complete ansatz matches well the numerics in the whole\nphase diagram when considering finite size effects.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a real-time Vehicle Collision Avoidance System (V-CAS)\ndesigned to enhance vehicle safety through adaptive braking based on\nenvironmental perception. V-CAS leverages the advanced vision-based transformer\nmodel RT-DETR, DeepSORT tracking, speed estimation, brake light detection, and\nan adaptive braking mechanism. It computes a composite collision risk score\nbased on vehicles' relative accelerations, distances, and detected braking\nactions, using brake light signals and trajectory data from multiple camera\nstreams to improve scene perception. Implemented on the Jetson Orin Nano, V-CAS\nenables real-time collision risk assessment and proactive mitigation through\nadaptive braking. A comprehensive training process was conducted on various\ndatasets for comparative analysis, followed by fine-tuning the selected object\ndetection model using transfer learning. The system's effectiveness was\nrigorously evaluated on the Car Crash Dataset (CCD) from YouTube and through\nreal-time experiments, achieving over 98% accuracy with an average proactive\nalert time of 1.13 seconds. Results indicate significant improvements in object\ndetection and tracking, enhancing collision avoidance compared to traditional\nsingle-camera methods. This research demonstrates the potential of low-cost,\nmulti-camera embedded vision transformer systems to advance automotive safety\nthrough enhanced environmental perception and proactive collision avoidance\nmechanisms.",

We study the magnetic properties of two\ncores (HH 211 MMS and IC 348 MMS) and a filamentary structure of IC 348. We\nfind that the overall field tends to be more perpendicular than parallel to the\nfilamentary structure of the region. The polarization fraction decreases with\nintensity, and we estimate the trend by power-law and the mean of the Rice\ndistribution fittings. The power indices for the cores are much smaller than 1,\nindicative of possible grain growth to micron size in the cores. We also\nmeasure the magnetic field strengths of the two cores and the filamentary area\nseparately by applying the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method and its alternative\nversion for compressed medium. The estimated mass-to-flux ratios are 0.45-2.20\nand 0.63-2.76 for HH 211 MMS and IC 348 MMS, respectively, while the ratios for\nthe filament is 0.33-1.50. This result may suggest that the transition from\nsubcritical to supercritical conditions occurs at the core scale ($\\sim$ 0.05\npc) in the region. In addition, we study the energy balance of the cores and\nfind that the relative strength of turbulence to the magnetic field tends to be\nstronger for IC 348 MMS than HH 211 MMS. The result could potentially explain\nthe different configurations inside the two cores: a single protostellar system\nin HH 211 MMS and multiple protostars in IC 348 MMS.",

By converting\ntime series into visual formats that LMMs can efficiently process, TAMA\nleverages few-shot in-context learning capabilities to reduce dependence on\nextensive labeled datasets. Our methodology is validated through rigorous\nexperimentation on multiple real-world datasets, where TAMA consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in TSAD tasks. Additionally, TAMA provides\nrich, natural language-based semantic analysis, offering deeper insights into\nthe nature of detected anomalies. Furthermore, we contribute one of the first\nopen-source datasets that includes anomaly detection labels, anomaly type\nlabels, and contextual description, facilitating broader exploration and\nadvancement within this critical field.

    "abstract": "Achieving high-quality Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction at\naccelerated acquisition rates remains challenging due to the inherent ill-posed\nnature of the inverse problem. Traditional Compressed Sensing (CS) methods,\nwhile robust across varying acquisition settings, struggle to maintain good\nreconstruction quality at high acceleration factors ($\\ge$ 8). Recent advances\nin deep learning have improved reconstruction quality, but purely data-driven\nmethods are prone to overfitting and hallucination effects, notably when the\nacquisition setting is varying. Plug-and-Play (PnP) approaches have been\nproposed to mitigate the pitfalls of both frameworks. In a nutshell, PnP\nalgorithms amount to replacing suboptimal handcrafted CS priors with powerful\ndenoising deep neural network (DNNs). However, in MRI reconstruction, existing\nPnP methods often yield suboptimal results due to instabilities in the proximal\ngradient descent (PGD) schemes and the lack of curated, noiseless datasets for\ntraining robust denoisers. In this work, we propose a fully unsupervised\npreprocessing pipeline to generate clean, noiseless complex MRI signals from\nmulticoil data, enabling training of a high-performance denoising DNN.\nFurthermore, we introduce an annealed Half-Quadratic Splitting (HQS) algorithm\nto address the instability issues, leading to significant improvements over\nexisting PnP algorithms.

On the\nother hand we show that every quasi-transitive graph $G$ of bounded pathwidth\nhas a periodic proper coloring with $\\chi(G)$ colors and a periodic\norientation.

Citation-based indicators\nsometimes support these tasks, but do not work for new articles and have low or\nmoderate accuracy. Previous research has shown that ChatGPT can estimate the\nquality of research articles, with its scores correlating positively with an\nexpert scores proxy in all fields, and often more strongly than citation-based\nindicators, except for clinical medicine. ChatGPT scores may therefore replace\ncitation-based indicators for some applications. This article investigates the\nclinical medicine anomaly with the largest dataset yet and a more detailed\nanalysis. The results showed that ChatGPT 4o-mini scores for articles submitted\nto the UK's Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 Unit of Assessment (UoA) 1\nClinical Medicine correlated positively (r=0.134, n=9872) with departmental\nmean REF scores, against a theoretical maximum correlation of r=0.226. ChatGPT\n4o and 3.5 turbo also gave positive correlations. At the departmental level,\nmean ChatGPT scores correlated more strongly with departmental mean REF scores\n(r=0.395, n=31). For the 100 journals with the most articles in UoA 1, their\nmean ChatGPT score correlated strongly with their REF score (r=0.495) but\nnegatively with their citation rate (r=-0.148). Journal and departmental\nanomalies in these results point to ChatGPT being ineffective at assessing the\nquality of research in prestigious medical journals or research directly\naffecting human health, or both. Nevertheless, the results give evidence of\nChatGPT's ability to assess research quality overall for Clinical Medicine,\nwhere it might replace citation-based indicators for new research.",

Recognizing that new data can act as forces\nstretching, compressing, or twisting the geometric relationships learned by a\nmodel, we explore various mathematical frameworks to quantify this deformation.\nWe investigate measures such as eigenvalue analysis of covariance matrices to\ncapture global shape changes, local density estimation using kernel density\nestimation (KDE), and Kullback-Leibler divergence to identify subtle shifts in\ndata concentration. Additionally, we draw inspiration from continuum mechanics\nby proposing a ''strain tensor'' analogy to capture multi-faceted deformations\nacross different data types. This requires careful estimation of the\ndisplacement field, and we delve into strategies ranging from density-based\napproaches to manifold learning and neural network methods. By continuously\nmonitoring these deformation metrics and correlating them with model\nperformance, we aim to provide a sensitive, interpretable, and adaptable drift\ndetection system capable of distinguishing benign data evolution from true\ndrift, enabling timely interventions and ensuring the reliability of machine\nlearning systems in dynamic environments.

In this paper, we take initial steps towards\ncorrecting predictive errors of ViTs, particularly those arising from\nsubpopulation shifts.

In addition to\nthe long-established inflectional instability predicted in the inviscid limit,\nwe demonstrate the existence of membrane flutter in the absence of density\nstratification. The latter is either due to an over-reflection process of\nsurface gravity waves or to the growth of Tollmien--Schlichting waves, as\noutlined in the context of boundary-layer theory. This fluid-structure\nconfiguration represents a paradigmatic model for investigating the interplay\nbetween inflectional, radiation-induced and shear-induced instabilities.

Furthermore, we assume that the system is\nstabilizable through a two-level control allocation. In this particular\nsetting, we cannot do much with the linearized system, and a direct nonlinear\ncontrol approach must be used to analyze the system stability. Under adequate\nassumptions and a suitable nonlinear continuous control-allocation law, we can\nprove uniform asymptotic convergence of the points of equilibrium using\nLyapunov input-to-state stability and the small gain theorem. This control\nallocation, however, requires the design of an allocated mapping and introduces\ntwo exogenous inputs. In particular, the closed-loop system is cascaded, and\nthe output of one subsystem is the disturbance of the other, and vice versa. In\ngeneral, it is difficult to find a closed-form solution for the allocated\nmapping; it needs to satisfy restrictive conditions, among which Lipschitz\ncontinuity to ensure that the disturbances eventually vanish. Additionally,\nthis mapping is in general nontrivial and non-unique. In this paper, we propose\na new kernel-based predictive control allocation to substitute the need for\ndesigning an analytic mapping, and assess if it can produce a meaningful\nmapping ``on-the-fly\" by solving online an optimization problem.

Our method thus provides unprecedented reference numbers that\ncan be used to assess the reliability of the commonly used computational\nprocedures in quantum chemistry, such as the counterpoise correction to the\nbasis set superposition errors, the frozen-core approximation, and the\ncomplete-basis-set extrapolation scheme. Such reference results can also be\nused to guide the development of more efficient correlation-consistent basis\nsets. The numerical techniques developed in the present work also have direct\nimplications for the development of basis error-free schemes for the GW method\nor the \\textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry methods such as MP2.",

    "abstract": "Context: As the diversity and complexity of regulations affecting\nSoftware-Intensive Products and Services (SIPS) is increasing, software\nengineers need to address the growing regulatory scrutiny. As with any other\nnon-negotiable requirements, SIPS compliance should be addressed early in SIPS\nengineering - i.e., during requirements engineering (RE). Objectives: In the\nconditions of the expanding regulatory landscape, existing research offers\nscattered insights into regulatory compliance of SIPS. This study addresses the\npressing need for a structured overview of the state of the art in software RE\nand its contribution to regulatory compliance of SIPS. Method: We conducted a\nsystematic mapping study to provide an overview of the current state of\nresearch regarding challenges, principles and practices for regulatory\ncompliance of SIPS related to RE. We focused on the role of RE and its\ncontribution to other SIPS lifecycle phases. We retrieved 6914 studies\npublished from 2017 until 2023 from four academic databases, which we filtered\ndown to 280 relevant primary studies. Results: We identified and categorized\nthe RE-related challenges in regulatory compliance of SIPS and their potential\nconnection to six types of principles and practices. We found that about 13.6%\nof the primary studies considered the involvement of both software engineers\nand legal experts. About 20.7% of primary studies considered RE in connection\nto other process areas. Most primary studies focused on a few popular\nregulation fields and application domains. Our results suggest that there can\nbe differences in terms of challenges and involvement of stakeholders across\ndifferent fields of regulation. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the need for\nan in-depth investigation of stakeholders' roles, relationships between process\nareas, and specific challenges for distinct regulatory fields to guide research\nand practice.",

Depending on the strength of the interlayer\nrepulsion, the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is expected to\nbe either $d$-wave or sign-changing bonding-antibonding $s_{\\pm}$-wave.\nUnfortunately, due to the need of high pressure to reach superconducting phase,\nconventional spectroscopic probes to validate the symmetry of the order\nparameter are hard to use. Here, we study the effect of the point-like\nnon-magnetic impurities on the superconducting state of La-327 and show that\n$s_{\\pm}$-wave and $d$-wave symmetries show a very different behavior as a\nfunction of impurity concentration, which can be studied experimentally by\nirradiating the La-327 samples by electrons prior applying the pressure. While\n$d-$wave superconducting state will be conventionally suppressed, the\n$s_{\\pm}$-wave state shows more subtle behavior, depending on the asymmetry\nbetween bonding and antibonding subspaces. For the electronic structure,\npredicted to realize in La-327, the $s_{\\pm}-$wave state will be robust against\ncomplete suppression and the transition temperature, $T_c$ demonstrates a\ntransition from convex to concave behavior, indicating a crossover from\n$s_{\\pm}$-wave to $s_{++}$-wave symmetry as a function of impurity\nconcentration.

Second,\nwe adapt our method to a decentralized framework in which data is distributed\namong multiple users.

We propose a user\nactivity detection with delay-calibration (UAD-DC) algorithm and investigate\nthe benefits of oversampling for the estimation of continuous time delays at\nthe receiver. The proposed algorithm iteratively estimates time delays and\ndetects active users by noting that the collided users can be identified\nthrough accurate estimation of time delays. Due to the sporadic user activity\npatterns, the user activity detection problem can be formulated as a\ncompressive sensing (CS) problem, which can be solved by a modified Turbo-CS\nalgorithm under the consideration of correlated noise samples resulting from\noversampling. A sliding-window technique is applied in the proposed algorithm\nto reduce the overall computational complexity.

We build RoboCrowd on top of ALOHA (Zhao et al. 2023) -- a\nbimanual platform that supports data collection via puppeteering -- to explore\nthe design space for crowdsourcing in-person demonstrations in a public\nenvironment. We propose three classes of incentive mechanisms to appeal to\nusers' varying sources of motivation for interacting with the system: material\nrewards, intrinsic interest, and social comparison. We instantiate these\nincentives through tasks that include physical rewards, engaging or challenging\nmanipulations, as well as gamification elements such as a leaderboard. We\nconduct a large-scale, two-week field experiment in which the platform is\nsituated in a university cafe. We observe significant engagement with the\nsystem -- over 200 individuals independently volunteered to provide a total of\nover 800 interaction episodes. Our findings validate the proposed incentives as\nmechanisms for shaping users' data quantity and quality. Further, we\ndemonstrate that the crowdsourced data can serve as useful pre-training data\nfor policies fine-tuned on expert demonstrations -- boosting performance up to\n20% compared to when this data is not available.

    "abstract": "The strong coupling between photons and phonons in polar materials gives rise\nto phonon-polaritons that encapsulate a wealth of physical information,\noffering crucial tools for the ultrafast terahertz sources and the topological\nengineering of terahertz light. However, it is still quite challenging to form\nand manipulate the terahertz phonon-polaritons under the ultrastrong coupling\nregime till now. In this work, we demonstrate the ultrastrong coupling between\nthe phonon (at 0.95 THz) in a MaPbI<sub>3</sub> film and the metallic bound\nstates in the continuum (BICs) in Au metasurfaces. The Rabi splitting can be\ncontinuously tuned from 28% to 48.4% of the phonon frequency by adjusting the\nparameters (size, shape and period) of Au metasurfaces, reaching the\nultrastrong coupling regime. By introducing wavelet transform, the mode\nevolution information of the terahertz phonon-polariton is successfully\nextracted. It indicates that the phonon radiation intensity of the\nMaPbI<sub>3</sub> film is enhanced as the coupling strength is increased. This\nwork not only establishes a new platform for terahertz devices but also opens\nnew avenues for exploring the intricate dynamics of terahertz\nphonon-polaritons.",

However, when high fields suppress the competing effect of\nsuperconductivity, spin stripe order is found to extend up to p*. Here, we\ninvestigated La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4 (Eu-LSCO) using 139La nuclear magnetic\nresonance and observe field-dependent spin fluctuations suggesting a similar\ncompetition between superconductivity and spin order as in LSCO. Nevertheless,\nwe find that static spin stripes are present practically up to p* irrespective\nof field strength: the stronger stripe order in Eu-LSCO prevents\nsuperconductivity from enforcing a non-magnetic ground state, except very close\nto p*. Thus, spin-stripe order is consistently bounded by p* in both LSCO and\nEu-LSCO, despite their differing balances between stripe order and\nsuperconductivity. This indicates that the canonical stripe order, where spins\nand charges are intertwined in a static pattern, is fundamentally tied to the\npseudogap phase, though the exact nature of this connection has yet to be\nelucidated. Any stripe order beyond the pseudogap endpoint must then be of a\ndifferent nature: either spin and charge orders remain intertwined, but both\nfluctuating, or only spin order fluctuates while charge order remains static.\nThe presence of spin-stripe order up to p*, the pervasive, slow, and\nfield-dependent spin-stripe fluctuations, as well as the electronic\ninhomogeneity documented in this work, must all be carefully considered in\ndiscussions of Fermi surface transformations, quantum criticality, and strange\nmetal behavior.",

Different from the existing works, this paper\ninvestigates two particular motion patterns of radiosondes in a typhoon, which\nsignificantly challenges the theoretical analysis. According to their\nparticular motion patterns, this paper first separately models the\ndistributions of horizontal and vertical distances from a radiosonde to its\nreceiver. Secondly, this paper derives the closed-form expressions of\ncumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF)\nof a radiosonde's three-dimensional (3D) propagation distance to its receiver.\nThirdly, this paper derives the analytical expression of the uplink CP for any\nradiosonde in the network. Finally, extensive numerical simulations are\nconducted to validate the theoretical analysis, and the influence of various\nnetwork design parameters are comprehensively discussed. Simulation results\nshow that when the signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) threshold is below\n-35 dB, and the density of radiosondes remains under 0.01/km^3, the uplink CP\napproaches 26%, 39%, and 50% in three patterns.",

Both algorithms\ndetermine an update strategy for the Lagrange multiplier, utilizing the values\nof the objective and constraint functions at the current and previous\niterations. This strategy accelerates the process of finding dual optimal\nsolutions. Subsequently, leveraging the problem's convexity, the primal optimal\nsolution is either directly identified or derived by solving a one-dimensional\nlinear equation. We also prove that both algorithms converge to optimal\nsolutions within a finite number of iterations. Numerical experiments on six\ntypes of practical test problems illustrate the superior computational\nefficiency of the proposed algorithms. For test problems with a general\ninequality constraint, the first algorithm achieves a CPU time reduction\nexceeding an order of magnitude compared to solvers such as Gurobi and CVX. For\ntest problems with a linear equality constraint, the second algorithm\nconsistently outperforms four existing algorithms, delivering an improvement of\nover two orders of magnitude in computational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The advent of large language models (LLMs) like GitHub Copilot has\nsignificantly enhanced programmers' productivity, particularly in code\ngeneration. However, these models often struggle with real-world tasks without\nfine-tuning. As LLMs grow larger and more performant, fine-tuning for\nspecialized tasks becomes increasingly expensive. Parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT) methods, which fine-tune only a subset of model parameters,\noffer a promising solution by reducing the computational costs of tuning LLMs\nwhile maintaining their performance. Existing studies have explored using PEFT\nand LLMs for various code-related tasks and found that the effectiveness of\nPEFT techniques is task-dependent. The application of PEFT techniques in unit\ntest generation remains underexplored. The state-of-the-art is limited to using\nLLMs with full fine-tuning to generate unit tests. This paper investigates both\nfull fine-tuning and various PEFT methods, including LoRA, (IA)^3, and prompt\ntuning, across different model architectures and sizes. We use well-established\nbenchmark datasets to evaluate their effectiveness in unit test generation. Our\nfindings show that PEFT methods can deliver performance comparable to full\nfine-tuning for unit test generation, making specialized fine-tuning more\naccessible and cost-effective.

In this paper, we investigate the\nfinite-temperature properties of the Kitaev model using the spin Green's\nfunction formalism. This approach enables the computation of key physical\nquantities such as spin correlations, magnetic susceptibility, and the\ndynamical spin structure factor, offering crucial insights into the system's\nthermal dynamics. In solving the equation of motion for the spin Green's\nfunction, we truncate the hierarchy of multi-spin Green's functions using a\ndecoupling approximation, which proves to be particularly accurate at high\ntemperatures. Our results show several similarities with Majorana-based\nnumerical simulations, though notable differences emerge. Specifically, both\nstatic and dynamical spin-spin correlation functions capture not only\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux excitations but also simple spin-flip excitations, with the\nlatter overshadowing the former. Interestingly, without explicitly assuming\nfractionalization, our results for the spin susceptibility and spin relaxation\nrate still suggest the presence of fermionic degrees of freedom at low\ntemperatures.

However, they fail to\nestablish reliable optimization objectives for unsupervised training, either\nrelying on overly strong geometric assumptions, or suffering from poor-quality\npseudo-labels due to inadequate integration of low-level geometric and\nhigh-level contextual information. We have observed that in the feature space,\nlatent new inlier correspondences tend to cluster around respective positive\nanchors that summarize features of existing inliers. Motivated by this\nobservation, we propose a novel unsupervised registration method termed INTEGER\nto incorporate high-level contextual information for reliable pseudo-label\nmining. Specifically, we propose the Feature-Geometry Coherence Mining module\nto dynamically adapt the teacher for each mini-batch of data during training\nand discover reliable pseudo-labels by considering both high-level feature\nrepresentations and low-level geometric cues. Furthermore, we propose\nAnchor-Based Contrastive Learning to facilitate contrastive learning with\nanchors for a robust feature space.

    "abstract": "When interacting with each other, humans adjust their behavior based on\nperceived trust. To achieve similar adaptability, robots must accurately\nestimate human trust at sufficiently granular timescales while collaborating\nwith humans. Beta reputation is a popular way to formalize a mathematical\nestimation of human trust. However, it relies on binary performance, which\nupdates trust estimations only after each task concludes. Additionally,\nmanually crafting a reward function is the usual method of building a\nperformance indicator, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. These\nlimitations prevent efficient capture of continuous trust changes at more\ngranular timescales throughout the collaboration task. Therefore, this paper\npresents a new framework for the estimation of human trust using beta\nreputation at fine-grained timescales. To achieve granularity in beta\nreputation, we utilize continuous reward values to update trust estimates at\neach timestep of a task. We construct a continuous reward function using\nmaximum entropy optimization to eliminate the need for the laborious\nspecification of a performance indicator. The proposed framework improves trust\nestimations by increasing accuracy, eliminating the need to manually craft a\nreward function, and advancing toward the development of more intelligent\nrobots.",

Moreover, both temporal coding (limited by\nunit cell diodes) and space-time coding (impaired by symbol anisotropy) exhibit\nirreducible harmonic interference and entangled control of amplitude, phase,\nand beam direction. This paper proposes a metasurface-enabled superheterodyne\narchitecture (MSA), comprising a digital up-conversion (DUC) module performing\nbaseband-to-intermediate frequency (IF) conversion, filtering, and\ndigital-to-analog conversion (DAC), and a reconfigurable metasurface featuring\nprogrammable unit cells that independently control both the magnitude and phase\nof the reflection coefficient.

This paper systematically\ninvestigates the influence of the hair parameter $\\beta$ on the timelike\ngeodesics of the regular hairy black hole, including the radius of the event\nhorizon, the properties of bound orbits, and the characteristics of\ngravitational wave radiation over a single period. The study reveals that\n$\\beta$ has a significant impact on the event horizon but only a minor effect\non the innermost stable circular orbit(ISCO), the marginally bound orbit(MBO),\nand periodic orbits. Moreover, the trajectories of the periodic orbits are\nnearly identical to those of the Schwarzschild black hole. In addition, the\nparameter $\\beta$ was constrained by simulating the precession observational\ndata of the S2 star orbiting the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. The results\nindicate that the correction effects of $\\beta$ comply with existing\nobservational constraints, without providing stricter limitations. Furthermore,\nby considering periodic orbits as transitional orbits in the extreme-mass-ratio\ninspiral (EMRI) system, it is found that the presence of $\\beta$ introduces\nsubtle effects on the amplitude, phase, and period of the gravitational wave\nsignal for a single orbit. Although these effects appear minor within a single\ncycle, they may accumulate into significant effects over long-term evolution.\nIn the future, space-based gravitational wave detectors are expected to further\ninvestigate the properties of the hair parameter, enhancing our understanding\nof the spacetime structure and dynamical behavior of black holes.",

Accurately predicting PTM sites and\ntheir specific types is therefore essential for elucidating protein function\nand understanding disease mechanisms. Existing computational approaches\npredominantly focus on protein sequences to predict PTM sites, driven by the\nrecognition of sequence-dependent motifs.

This model not only captures the\ntypical sequence motifs associated with PTMs but also leverages the spatial\narrangements dictated by protein tertiary structures, thus providing a holistic\nview of the factors influencing PTM sites. Designed to address the long-tail\ndistribution of PTM types, MeToken employs uniform sub-codebooks that ensure\neven the rarest PTMs are adequately represented and distinguished. We validate\nthe effectiveness and generalizability of MeToken across multiple datasets,\ndemonstrating its superior performance in accurately identifying PTM types.

    "abstract": "Although there have been automated approaches and tools supporting toxicity\ncensorship for social posts, most of them focus on detection. Toxicity\ncensorship is a complex process, wherein detection is just an initial task and\na user can have further needs such as rationale understanding and content\nmodification. For this problem, we conduct a needfinding study to investigate\npeople's diverse needs in toxicity censorship and then build a ChatGPT-based\ncensorship tool named DeMod accordingly. DeMod is equipped with the features of\nexplainable Detection and personalized Modification, providing fine-grained\ndetection results, detailed explanations, and personalized modification\nsuggestions. We also implemented the tool and recruited 35 Weibo users for\nevaluation. The results suggest DeMod's multiple strengths like the richness of\nfunctionality, the accuracy of censorship, and ease of use. Based on the\nfindings, we further propose several insights into the design of content\ncensorship systems.",

    "abstract": "Data sharing is a prerequisite for collaborative innovation, enabling\norganizations to leverage diverse datasets for deeper insights. In real-world\napplications like FinTech and Smart Manufacturing, transactional data, often in\ntabular form, are generated and analyzed for insight generation. However, such\ndatasets typically contain sensitive personal/business information, raising\nprivacy concerns and regulatory risks. Data synthesis tackles this by\ngenerating artificial datasets that preserve the statistical characteristics of\nreal data, removing direct links to individuals. However, attackers can still\ninfer sensitive information using background knowledge. Differential privacy\noffers a solution by providing provable and quantifiable privacy protection.\nConsequently, differentially private data synthesis has emerged as a promising\napproach to privacy-aware data sharing. This paper provides a comprehensive\noverview of existing differentially private tabular data synthesis methods,\nhighlighting the unique challenges of each generation model for generating\ntabular data under differential privacy constraints. We classify the methods\ninto statistical and deep learning-based approaches based on their generation\nmodels, discussing them in both centralized and distributed environments. We\nevaluate and compare those methods within each category, highlighting their\nstrengths and weaknesses in terms of utility, privacy, and computational\ncomplexity.

We\nfurther show that CSCL mitigates spurious correlations between language\nresources and safety alignment, presenting a robust, efficient framework for\nmore equitable language transfer in LLMs. We observe that CSCL is effective for\nlow-resource settings where high-quality, monolingual corpora for language\ntransfer are hardly available.",

This task focuses\non accurately retrieving molecule structures based on textual descriptions, by\neffectively aligning textual descriptions and molecules to assist researchers\nin identifying suitable molecular candidates. However, many existing approaches\noverlook the details inherent in molecule sub-structures. In this work, we\nintroduce the Optimal TRansport-based Multi-grained Alignments model (ORMA), a\nnovel approach that facilitates multi-grained alignments between textual\ndescriptions and molecules. Our model features a text encoder and a molecule\nencoder. The text encoder processes textual descriptions to generate both\ntoken-level and sentence-level representations, while molecules are modeled as\nhierarchical heterogeneous graphs, encompassing atom, motif, and molecule nodes\nto extract representations at these three levels. A key innovation in ORMA is\nthe application of Optimal Transport (OT) to align tokens with motifs, creating\nmulti-token representations that integrate multiple token alignments with their\ncorresponding motifs. Additionally, we employ contrastive learning to refine\ncross-modal alignments at three distinct scales: token-atom, multitoken-motif,\nand sentence-molecule, ensuring that the similarities between correctly matched\ntext-molecule pairs are maximized while those of unmatched pairs are minimized.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explore alignments at both the\nmotif and multi-token levels.

A tunable version of rotary position embedding is also integrated\ninto ElasTST to capture time-series-specific periods and enhance adaptability\nto different horizons.

We\ndesign an RL-based training algorithm that encourages the model to decompose a\ntheorem into lemmas, prove the lemmas, and then prove the theorem by using the\nlemmas. Our reward mechanism is inspired by how mathematicians train\nthemselves: even if a theorem is too challenging to be proved by the current\nmodel, a positive reward is still given to the model for any correct and novel\nlemmas that are proposed and proved in this process. During training, our model\nproposes and proves lemmas that are not in the training dataset. In fact, these\nnewly-proposed correct lemmas consist of 37.7% of the training replay buffer\nwhen we train on the dataset extracted from Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP). The\nmodel trained by our RL algorithm outperforms that trained by supervised\nfinetuning, improving the pass rate from 40.8% to 45.5% on AFP test set, and\nfrom 36.5% to 39.5% on an out-of-distribution test set.",

Despite of their wide adoption, existing FL and PFL works have\nyet to comprehensively address the class-imbalance issue, one of the most\ncritical challenges within the realm of data heterogeneity in PFL and FL\nresearch. In this paper, we propose FedReMa, an efficient PFL algorithm that\ncan tackle class-imbalance by 1) utilizing an adaptive inter-client co-learning\napproach to identify and harness different clients' expertise on different data\nclasses throughout various phases of the training process, and 2) employing\ndistinct aggregation methods for clients' feature extractors and classifiers,\nwith the choices informed by the different roles and implications of these\nmodel components.

Outside the CCP, we employ an additional scheme\nfor model aggregation that utilizes historical records of each client's most\nrelevant peers to further enhance the personalization stability.

Anisotropic strain reduces the point group symmetry of the\nmanganese (Mn) Kagome triangles from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{1}$, significantly\naltering the energy landscape of the magnetic states in Mn$_{3}$Sn.

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) are widely used in Graph Anomaly Detection\n(GAD) due to their natural compatibility with graph structures, resulting in\nsignificant performance improvements. However, most researchers approach GAD as\na graph node classification task and often rely on low-pass filters or feature\naggregation from neighboring nodes. This paper proposes a novel approach by\nintroducing a High-Pass Graph Convolution Network (HP-GCN) for GAD. The\nproposed HP-GCN leverages high-frequency components to detect anomalies, as\nanomalies tend to increase high-frequency signals within the network of normal\nnodes. Additionally, isolated nodes, which lack interactions with other nodes,\npresent a challenge for Graph Neural Network (GNN). To address this, the model\nsegments the graph into isolated nodes and nodes within connected subgraphs.\nIsolated nodes learn their features through Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),\nenhancing detection accuracy. The model is evaluated and validated on YelpChi,\nAmazon, T-Finance, and T-Social datasets. The results showed that the proposed\nHP-GCN can achieve anomaly detection accuracy of 96.10%, 98.16%, 96.46%, and\n98.94%, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the HP-GCN outperforms\nexisting GAD methods based on spatial domain GNN as well as those using\nlow-pass and band-pass filters in spectral domain GCN. The findings underscore\nthe effectiveness of this method in improving anomaly detection performance.\nSource code can be found at: https://github.com/meteor0033/High-pass_GAD.git.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing goal in robot learning is to develop methods for robots to\nacquire new skills autonomously. While reinforcement learning (RL) comes with\nthe promise of enabling autonomous data collection, it remains challenging to\nscale in the real-world partly due to the significant effort required for\nenvironment design and instrumentation, including the need for designing reset\nfunctions or accurate success detectors. On the other hand, imitation learning\n(IL) methods require little to no environment design effort, but instead\nrequire significant human supervision in the form of collected demonstrations.\nTo address these shortcomings, recent works in autonomous IL start with an\ninitial seed dataset of human demonstrations that an autonomous policy can\nbootstrap from. While autonomous IL approaches come with the promise of\naddressing the challenges of autonomous RL as well as pure IL strategies, in\nthis work, we posit that such techniques do not deliver on this promise and are\nstill unable to scale up autonomous data collection in the real world. Through\na series of real-world experiments, we demonstrate that these approaches, when\nscaled up to realistic settings, face much of the same scaling challenges as\nprior attempts in RL in terms of environment design. Further, we perform a\nrigorous study of autonomous IL methods across different data scales and 7\nsimulation and real-world tasks, and demonstrate that while autonomous data\ncollection can modestly improve performance, simply collecting more human data\noften provides significantly more improvement. Our work suggests a negative\nresult: that scaling up autonomous data collection for learning robot policies\nfor real-world tasks is more challenging and impractical than what is suggested\nin prior work. We hope these insights about the core challenges of scaling up\ndata collection help inform future efforts in autonomous learning.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of fairly and efficiently allocating indivisible goods\namong agents with additive valuation functions. Envy-freeness up to one good\n(EF1) is a well-studied fairness notion for indivisible goods, while Pareto\noptimality (PO) and its stronger variant, fractional Pareto optimality (fPO),\nare widely recognized efficiency criteria. Although each property is\nstraightforward to achieve individually, simultaneously ensuring both fairness\nand efficiency is challenging. Caragiannis et\nal.~\\cite{caragiannis2019unreasonable} established the surprising result that\nmaximizing Nash social welfare yields an allocation that is both EF1 and PO;\nhowever, since maximizing Nash social welfare is NP-hard, this approach does\nnot provide an efficient algorithm. To overcome this barrier, Barman,\nKrishnamurthy, and Vaish~\\cite{barman2018finding} designed a pseudo-polynomial\ntime algorithm to compute an EF1 and PO allocation, and showed the existence of\nEF1 and fPO allocations. Nevertheless, the latter existence proof relies on a\nnon-constructive convergence argument and does not directly yield an efficient\nalgorithm for finding EF1 and fPO allocations. Whether a polynomial-time\nalgorithm exists for finding an EF1 and PO (or fPO) allocation remains an\nimportant open problem.\n  In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to compute an\nallocation that achieves both EF1 and fPO under additive valuation functions\nwhen the number of agents is fixed. Our primary idea is to avoid processing the\nentire instance at once; instead, we sequentially add agents to the instance\nand construct an allocation that satisfies EF1 and fPO at each step.",

This variability frequently causes catastrophic forgetting\nin continual EEG decoding tasks, where previously acquired knowledge is\noverwritten as new subjects are introduced. While retraining the entire dataset\nfor each new subject can mitigate forgetting, this approach imposes significant\ncomputational costs, rendering it impractical for real-world applications.\nTherefore, an ideal brain-computer interface (BCI) model should incrementally\nlearn new information without requiring complete retraining, thereby reducing\ncomputational overhead. Existing EEG decoding meth-ods typically rely on large,\ncentralized source-domain datasets for pre-training to improve model\ngeneralization. However, in practical scenarios, data availability is often\nconstrained by privacy concerns. Furthermore, these methods are susceptible to\ncatastrophic forgetting in continual EEG decoding tasks, significantly limiting\ntheir utility in long-term learning scenarios. To address these issues, we\npropose the Personalized Continual EEG Decoding (PCED) framework for continual\nEEG decoding. The framework uses Euclidean Alignment for fast domain\nadap-tation, reducing inter-subject variability. To retain knowledge and\nprevent forgetting, it includes an exemplar replay mechanism that preserves key\ninformation from past tasks. A reservoir sampling-based memory management\nstrategy optimizes exemplar storage to handle memory constraints in long-term\nlearning.

Unfortunately, such environments tend to be highly\ndynamic and unstructured, and their frequent reconfiguration poses a challenge\nfor robust long-term localization of robots. Many state-of-the-art visual\nfeature-based localization algorithms are not robust towards spatial scene\nchanges, and SLAM algorithms, while promising, cannot run within the\nlow-compute budget available to space robots. To address this gap, we present a\ncomputationally efficient semantic masking approach for visual feature matching\nthat improves the accuracy and robustness of visual localization systems during\nlong-term deployment in changing environments. Our method introduces a\nlightweight check that enforces matches to be within long-term static objects\nand have consistent semantic classes. We evaluate this approach using both\nmap-based relocalization and relative pose estimation and show that it improves\nAbsolute Trajectory Error (ATE) and correct match ratios on the publicly\navailable Astrobee dataset. While this approach was originally developed for\nmicrogravity robotic freeflyers, it can be applied to any visual feature\nmatching pipeline to improve robustness.",

Among PEFT methods, sparse tuning achieves superior performance by\nonly adjusting the weights most relevant to downstream tasks, rather than\ndensely tuning the whole weight matrix. However, this performance improvement\nhas been accompanied by increases in memory usage, which stems from two\nfactors, i.e., the storage of the whole weight matrix as learnable parameters\nin the optimizer and the additional storage of tunable weight indexes. In this\npaper, we propose a method named SNELL (Sparse tuning with kerNELized LoRA) for\nsparse tuning with low memory usage. To achieve low memory usage, SNELL\ndecomposes the tunable matrix for sparsification into two learnable low-rank\nmatrices, saving from the costly storage of the whole original matrix. A\ncompetition-based sparsification mechanism is further proposed to avoid the\nstorage of tunable weight indexes. To maintain the effectiveness of sparse\ntuning with low-rank matrices, we extend the low-rank decomposition by applying\nnonlinear kernel functions to the whole-matrix merging. Consequently, we gain\nan increase in the rank of the merged matrix, enhancing the ability of SNELL in\nadapting the pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple downstream tasks show that SNELL achieves state-of-the-art performance\nwith low memory usage, endowing PEFT with sparse tuning to large-scale models.\nCodes are available at https://github.com/ssfgunner/SNELL.",

    "abstract": "In Large Language Model (LLM) development, Reinforcement Learning from Human\nFeedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning models with human values and\npreferences. RLHF traditionally relies on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\nbetween the current policy and a frozen initial policy as a reference, which is\nadded as a penalty in policy optimization algorithms like Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO). While this constraint prevents models from deviating too\nfar from the initial checkpoint, it limits exploration of the reward landscape,\nreducing the model's ability to discover higher-quality solutions. As a result,\npolicy optimization is often trapped in a narrow region of the parameter space,\nleading to suboptimal alignment and performance. This paper presents SALSA\n(Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation), a novel approach\ndesigned to overcome these limitations by creating a more flexible and better\nlocated reference model through weight-space averaging of two independent\nsupervised fine-tuned (SFT) models. This model soup allows for larger deviation\nin KL divergence and exploring a promising region of the solution space without\nsacrificing stability. By leveraging this more robust reference model, SALSA\nfosters better exploration, achieving higher rewards and improving model\nrobustness, out-of-distribution generalization, and performance. We validate\nthe effectiveness of SALSA through extensive experiments on popular open models\n(Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-2B) across various benchmarks (MT-Bench,\nArena-Hard, UltraFeedback), where it consistently surpasses PPO by fostering\ndeeper exploration and achieving superior alignment in LLMs.",

    "abstract": "In the graph-based semi-supervised learning, the Green-function method is a\nclassical method that works by computing the Green's function in the graph\nspace. However, when applied to large graphs, especially those sparse ones,\nthis method performs unstably and unsatisfactorily. We make a detailed analysis\non it and propose a novel method from the perspective of optimization. On fully\nconnected graphs, the method is equivalent to the Green-function method and can\nbe seen as another interpretation with physical meanings, while on non-fully\nconnected graphs, it helps to explain why the Green-function method causes a\nmess on large sparse graphs. To solve this dilemma, we propose a workable\napproach to improve our proposed method. Unlike the original method, our\nimproved method can also apply two accelerating techniques, Gaussian\nElimination, and Anchored Graphs to become more efficient on large graphs.\nFinally, the extensive experiments prove our conclusions and the efficiency,\naccuracy, and stability of our improved Green's function method.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning and planning\ncapabilities. Most prior work in this area has used LLMs to reason through\nsteps from an initial to a goal state or criterion, thereby effectively\nreasoning in a forward direction. Nonetheless, many planning problems exhibit\nan inherent asymmetry such that planning backward from the goal is\nsignificantly easier -- for example, if there are bottlenecks close to the\ngoal. We take inspiration from this observation and demonstrate that this bias\nholds for LLM planning as well: planning performance in one direction\ncorrelates with the planning complexity of the problem in that direction.\nHowever, our experiments also reveal systematic biases which lead to poor\nplanning in the backward direction. With this knowledge, we propose a backward\nplanning algorithm for LLMs that first flips the problem and then plans forward\nin the flipped problem. This helps avoid the backward bias, generate more\ndiverse candidate plans, and exploit asymmetries between the forward and\nbackward directions in planning problems -- we find that combining planning in\nboth directions with self-verification improves the overall planning success\nrates by 4-24% in three planning domains.",

    "abstract": "Software testing remains the most widely used methodology for validating\nquality of code. However, effectiveness of testing critically depends on the\nquality of test suites used. Test cases in a test suite consist of two\nfundamental parts: (1) input values for the code under test, and (2) correct\nchecks for the outputs it produces. These checks are commonly written as\nassertions, and termed test oracles. The last couple of decades have seen much\nprogress in automated test input generation, e.g., using fuzzing and symbolic\nexecution. However, automating test oracles remains a relatively less explored\nproblem area. Indeed, a test oracle by its nature requires knowledge of\nexpected behavior, which may only be known to the developer and may not not\nexist in a formal language that supports automated reasoning.\n  Our focus in this paper is automation of test oracles for clients of widely\nused Java libraries, e.g., java.lang and java.util packages. Our key insight is\nthat Javadocs that provide a rich source of information can enable automated\ngeneration of test oracles. Javadocs of the core Java libraries are fairly\ndetailed documents that contain natural language descriptions of not only how\nthe libraries behave but also how the clients must (not) use them. We use large\nlanguage models as an enabling technology to embody our insight into a\nframework for test oracle automation, and evaluate it experimentally. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that LLMs can generate oracles for checking normal and\nexceptional behaviors from Javadocs, with 98.8% of these oracles being\ncompilable and 96.4% accurately reflecting intended properties. Even for the\nfew incorrect oracles, errors are minor and can be easily corrected with the\nhelp of additional comment information generated by the LLMs.",

This methodology was motivated by, developed and evaluated in\nthe context of estimating blood glucose levels in different medical settings.\nBoth simulated and real data are used to evaluate the methodology from\ndifferent perspectives, such as its ability to estimate unmeasured variables,\nits ability to reproduce the correct qualitative blood glucose dynamics, how it\nmanages known non-stationarity, and how it performs when given a range of dense\nand severely sparse data.

To solve the input heterogeneity issue, we adopt vector\nquantization that maps item embeddings from heterogeneous input spaces to a\nshared feature space. Moreover, our meta transfer paradigm exploits limited\ntarget data to guide the transfer of source domain knowledge to the target\ndomain (i.e., learn to transfer). In addition, MetaRec adaptively transfers\nfrom multiple source tasks by rescaling meta gradients based on the\nsource-target domain similarity, enabling selective learning to improve\nrecommendation performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we\nperform extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, where MetaRec consistently\noutperforms baseline methods by a considerable margin.",

Furthermore, the duality between Lifshitz branes\nand Bose gases relates a Lifshitz brane with exponent $\\alpha$ in\n$D$-dimensional spacetime to a Bose gas of quasi-particles with energy\n$k^\\alpha$ in $D-2$ spatial dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Prediction is a fundamental capability of all living organisms, and has been\nproposed as an objective for learning sensory representations. Recent work\ndemonstrates that in primate visual systems, prediction is facilitated by\nneural representations that follow straighter temporal trajectories than their\ninitial photoreceptor encoding, which allows for prediction by linear\nextrapolation. Inspired by these experimental findings, we develop a\nself-supervised learning (SSL) objective that explicitly quantifies and\npromotes straightening. We demonstrate the power of this objective in training\ndeep feedforward neural networks on smoothly-rendered synthetic image sequences\nthat mimic commonly-occurring properties of natural videos. The learned model\ncontains neural embeddings that are predictive, but also factorize the\ngeometric, photometric, and semantic attributes of objects. The representations\nalso prove more robust to noise and adversarial attacks compared to previous\nSSL methods that optimize for invariance to random augmentations. Moreover,\nthese beneficial properties can be transferred to other training procedures by\nusing the straightening objective as a regularizer, suggesting a broader\nutility for straightening as a principle for robust unsupervised learning.",

    "abstract": "The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion model is widely used to describe\nhow a compact object accretes material from a companion's stellar wind in\nbinary systems. However, its standard implementation becomes inaccurate when\nthe wind velocity ($v_\\mathrm{w}$) is comparable to or less than the orbital\nvelocity ($v_\\mathrm{o}$), predicting non-physical accretion efficiencies above\nunity. This limits its applicability to systems with low wind-to-orbital\nvelocity ratios ($w= v_\\mathrm{w} / v_\\mathrm{o} \\leq 1$), such as symbiotic\nsystems. We revisit the implementation of the BHL model and introduce a\ngeometric correction factor that accounts for the varying orientation of the\naccretion cylinder relative to the wind direction. This correction ensures\nphysically plausible accretion efficiencies ($\\eta \\leq 1$) for all $w$ in\ncircular orbits. Our new implementation naturally predicts the flattening of\nthe accretion efficiency observed in numerical simulations for $w < 1$, without\nthe need for ad hoc adjustments. We also peer into the implications of our\nprescription for the less-explored case of eccentric orbits, highlighting the\nkey role of the geometric correction factor in shaping the accretion process.\nWe compare our predictions with numerical simulations, finding good agreement\nfor a wide range of parameters. Applications to the symbiotic star R~Aqr and\nthe X-ray binary LS 5039 are presented.

The design of correct reward functions,\nexpressed as a reward machine, is a key programming activity in this process.\nIn 2007, Boston Scientific published a detailed description of their pacemaker\nspecifications.

In brief, during the\ntraining phase, we introduce a teacher network to learn the rotation robustness\ninformation and transfer this information to the student network through online\ndistillation. In the inference phase, the student network directly utilizes the\noriginal 3D coordinate information to achieve the robustness of rotation\nperturbation. Experiments carried out on four different datasets verify the\neffectiveness of our method. Averagely, on the Modelnet40 and ScanobjectNN\nclassification datasets with random rotation perturbations, our classification\naccuracy has respectively improved by 4.92% and 4.41%, compared to popular\nrotation-robust networks; on the ShapeNet and S3DIS segmentation datasets,\ncompared to the rotation-robust networks, the improvements of mIoU are 7.36%\nand 4.82%, respectively. Besides, from the experimental results, the proposed\nalgorithm also shows excellent performance in resisting noise and outliers.",

While this approach is effective in closed,\nnarrowly scoped environments, it presents two major challenges for real-world,\nopen-ended scenarios: (1) it significantly restricts the planning and acting\ncapabilities of LLM agents, and (2) it requires substantial human effort to\nenumerate and implement all possible actions, which is impractical in complex\nenvironments with a vast number of potential actions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose an LLM agent framework that can dynamically create and\ncompose actions as needed. In this framework, the agent interacts with its\nenvironment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose\nprogramming language. Moreover, generated actions are accumulated over time for\nfuture reuse. Our extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that\nthis framework significantly improves flexibility and outperforms prior methods\nthat rely on a fixed action set. Notably, it enables LLM agents to adapt and\nrecover in scenarios where predefined actions are insufficient or fail due to\nunforeseen edge cases.

Their catalytic\nefficiency is quantified by the turnover number (kcat), a parameter in enzyme\nkinetics. Enhancing enzyme activity is important for optimizing slow chemical\nreactions, with far-reaching implications for both research and industrial\napplications. However, traditional wet-lab methods for measuring and optimizing\nenzyme activity are often resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address\nthese limitations, we introduce kcatDiffuser, a novel regressor-guided\ndiffusion model designed to predict and improve enzyme turnover numbers. Our\napproach innovatively reformulates enzyme mutation prediction as a protein\ninverse folding task, thereby establishing a direct link between structural\nprediction and functional optimization. kcatDiffuser is a graph diffusion model\nguided by a regressor, enabling the prediction of amino acid mutations at\nmultiple random positions simultaneously. Evaluations on BERENDA dataset shows\nthat kcatDiffuser can achieve a {\\Delta} log kcat of 0.209, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods like ProteinMPNN, PiFold, GraDe-IF in improving enzyme\nturnover numbers.

Previously, it has been proposed that a 2D\nelectron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling can generate dissipationless\ntransverse spin current, namely the spin Hall effect. However, later work\nshowed that the spin current is canceled by vertex correction, which was\nsubsequently proven by a cancellation theorem that does not depend on any\nassumptions related to the scattering mechanism, the strength of spin-orbit\ncoupling, or the Fermi energy. While the recent proposal demonstrates a\nuniversal intrinsic spin-tensor Hall conductivity, it is unclear if it vanishes\nsimilarly to the spin Hall effect. In this work, we address this critical\nproblem and show that the rank-2 spin-tensor current can be divergent by\nconsidering the contributions of both interbranch and intrabranch transitions,\nwhich resembles the quantum Hall effect in some sense.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the influence of this averaging effect on patch force estimations\nusing both analytic and numerical methods. First, we derive the correlation\nfunctions of patch potential and establish the formulas for calculating the\nelectrostatic patch forces in the parallel-plate geometry, with and without\nconsideration of the KPFM measurement effect. Thus, an analytic method is\nestablished to determine the accuracy of patch force evaluation when the\nstatistical parameters of the patch potential and the lateral resolution of the\nKPFM are given. Second, numerical simulations are employed to explore the\ndependence of estimated patch forces on the KPFM's lateral resolution under\nmore realistic conditions. Both analytic and numerical results show a similar\ndependence of the patch force estimation on the patch characteristic size,\npotential fluctuation and the lateral resolution of the KPFM. It is also found\nthat the underestimation of the patch force becomes less sensitive to the\nKPFM's resolution as the separation between plates increases.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we are concerned with a modified Euler scheme for the SDE\nunder consideration, where the drift is of super-linear growth and dissipative\nmerely outside a closed ball. By adopting the synchronous coupling, along with\nthe construction of an equivalent quasi-metric, the $L^2$-Wasserstein\ncontraction of the modified Euler scheme is addressed provided that the\ndiffusivity is large enough. In particular, as a by-product, the $L^2$\nWasserstein contraction of the projected (truncated) Euler scheme and the tamed\nEuler algorithm is treated under much more explicit conditions imposed on\ndrifts. The theory derived on the $L^2$-Wasserstein contraction has numerous\napplications on various aspects. In addition to applications on Poincar\\'{e}\ninequalities (with respect to the numerical transition kernel and the numerical\ninvariant probability measure), concentration inequalities for empirical\naverages, and bounds concerning the KL-divergence, in this paper we present\nanother two potential applications. One concerns the non-asymptotic\n$L^2$-Wasserstein bound corresponding to the projected Euler scheme and the\ntamed Euler recursion, respectively, which further implies the\n$L^2$-Wasserstein error bound between the exact invariant probability measure\nand the numerical counterpart. It is worthy to emphasize that the associated\nconvergence rate is improved greatly in contrast to the existing literature.\nAnother application is devoted to the strong law of large numbers of additive\nfunctionals related to the modified Euler algorithm, where the observable\nfunctions involved are allowed to be of polynomial growth, and the associated\nconvergence rate is also enhanced remarkably.",

The rotating wind, which is shocked, is launched from a\nradius of 9-15 au, slightly exterior to that of the previously detected SO\nshell, which marks the boundary where the wide-angle X-wind is interacting with\nand shocking the disk wind. Additionally, the SO is found to be mixed with the\nCO emission within the thick and extended rotating wind region. The large scale\nCO shocked wind coexists with the SO emission near the upper portion of the\ninner shocked region converged on top of the inner SiO knots.

This explains why group-level confounding can\ngreatly bias MLM's treatment coefficient estimates. However, unlike the linear\nsetting, there is not an exact equivalence between MLM and RegFE in GLMs. (ii)\nSecond, we study a generalization of \"bias-corrected MLM\" (bcMLM) to the GLM\nsetting, and a corresponding \"bias-corrected RegFE\" (bcRegFE). None of FE,\nbcMLM, or bcRegFE entirely solve MLM's bias problem in GLMs, but bcMLM and\nbcRegFE tend to show less bias than does FE. (iii) Third, as in the linear\nsetting, MLM's default standard errors can misspecify the true intragroup\ndependence structure in the GLM setting, which can yield downwardly biased\nstandard errors. A cluster bootstrap is a more agnostic alternative. We also\nconsider a cluster-robust standard error for (bc)RegFE. Ultimately, for\nnon-linear GLMs, we recommend bcMLM for estimating the treatment coefficient,\nand a cluster bootstrap for standard errors and confidence intervals.

However, lack of high quality data\nto train the ML models is a major challenge to realize the potential of ML in\nwound care. In fact, data limitations are the biggest challenge in studies\nusing medical or forensic imaging today. We study data augmentation techniques\nthat can be used to overcome the data scarcity limitations and unlock the\npotential of deep learning based solutions. In our study we explore a range of\ndata augmentation techniques from geometric transformations of wound images to\nadvanced GANs, to enrich and expand datasets. Using the Keras, Tensorflow, and\nPandas libraries, we implemented the data augmentation techniques that can\ngenerate realistic wound images. We show that geometric data augmentation can\nimprove classification performance, F1 scores, by up to 11% on top of\nstate-of-the-art models, across several key classes of wounds. Our experiments\nwith GAN based augmentation prove the viability of using DE-GANs to generate\nwound images with richer variations. Our study and results show that data\naugmentation is a valuable privacy-preserving tool with huge potential to\novercome the data scarcity limitations and we believe it will be part of any\nreal-world ML-based wound care system.",

    "abstract": "QMA is the class of languages that can be decided by an efficient quantum\nverifier given a quantum witness, whereas QCMA is the class of such languages\nwhere the efficient quantum verifier only is given a classical witness. A\nchallenging fundamental goal in quantum query complexity is to find a classical\noracle separation for these classes. In this work, we offer a new approach\ntowards proving such a separation that is qualitatively different than prior\nwork, and show that our approach is sound assuming a natural statistical\nconjecture which may have other applications to quantum query complexity lower\nbounds.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant popularity for learning\nrepresentations of graph-structured data due to their expressive power and\nscalability. However, despite their success in domains such as social network\nanalysis, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics, GNNs often face\nchallenges related to stability, generalization, and robustness to noise and\nadversarial attacks. Regularization techniques have shown promise in addressing\nthese challenges by controlling model complexity and improving robustness.\nBuilding on recent advancements in contractive GNN architectures, this paper\npresents a novel method for inducing contractive behavior in any GNN through\nSVD regularization. By deriving a sufficient condition for contractiveness in\nthe update step and applying constraints on network parameters, we demonstrate\nthe impact of SVD regularization on the Lipschitz constant of GNNs. Our\nfindings highlight the role of SVD regularization in enhancing the stability\nand generalization of GNNs, contributing to the development of more robust\ngraph-based learning algorithms dynamics.",

    "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have\ngained attention for their ability to enhance LLMs' reasoning by incorporating\nexternal knowledge but suffer from limited contextual window size, leading to\ninsufficient information injection. To this end, we propose a novel framework,\nRuAG, to automatically distill large volumes of offline data into interpretable\nfirst-order logic rules, which are injected into LLMs to boost their reasoning\ncapabilities. Our method begins by formulating the search process relying on\nLLMs' commonsense, where LLMs automatically define head and body predicates.\nThen, RuAG applies Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to address the combinational\nsearching space and efficiently discover logic rules from data. The resulting\nlogic rules are translated into natural language, allowing targeted knowledge\ninjection and seamless integration into LLM prompts for LLM's downstream task\nreasoning. We evaluate our framework on public and private industrial tasks,\nincluding natural language processing, time-series, decision-making, and\nindustrial tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LLM's capability\nover diverse tasks.",
