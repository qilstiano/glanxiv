    "abstract": "People acquire concepts through rich physical and social experiences and use\nthem to understand the world. In contrast, large language models (LLMs),\ntrained exclusively through next-token prediction over language data, exhibit\nremarkably human-like behaviors. Are these models developing concepts akin to\nhumans, and if so, how are such concepts represented and organized? To address\nthese questions, we reframed the classic reverse dictionary task to simulate\nhuman concept inference in context and investigated the emergence of human-like\nconceptual representations within LLMs. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can\nflexibly derive concepts from linguistic descriptions in relation to contextual\ncues about other concepts. The derived representations converged towards a\nshared, context-independent structure that effectively predicted human behavior\nacross key psychological phenomena, including computation of similarities,\ncategories and semantic scales. Moreover, these representations aligned well\nwith neural activity patterns in the human brain, even in response to visual\nrather than linguistic stimuli, providing evidence for biological plausibility.\nThese findings establish that structured, human-like conceptual representations\ncan naturally emerge from language prediction without real-world grounding.\nMore broadly, our work positions LLMs as promising computational tools for\nunderstanding complex human cognition and paves the way for better alignment\nbetween artificial and human intelligence.",

To prevent these systems from causing\nsocial, legal, ethical, empathetic, or cultural (SLEEC) harms, normative\nrequirements specify the permissible range of their behaviors. These\nrequirements encompass both functional and non-functional aspects and are\ndefined with respect to time. Typically, these requirements are specified by\nstakeholders from a broad range of fields, such as lawyers, ethicists, or\nphilosophers, who may lack technical expertise. Because such stakeholders often\nhave different goals, responsibilities, and objectives, ensuring that these\nrequirements are well-formed is crucial. SLEEC DSL, a domain-specific language\nresembling natural language, has been developed to formalize these requirements\nas SLEEC rules. In this paper, we present LEGOS-SLEEC, a tool designed to\nsupport interdisciplinary stakeholders in specifying normative requirements as\nSLEEC rules, and in analyzing and debugging their well-formedness. LEGOS-SLEEC\nis built using four previously published components, which have been shown to\nbe effective and usable across nine case studies. Reflecting on this\nexperience, we have significantly improved the user interface of LEGOS-SLEEC\nand its diagnostic support, and demonstrate the effectiveness of these\nimprovements using four interdisciplinary stakeholders.

Specifically, the\nequations of motion remain symmetric hyperbolic and causal at all times along\nany continuously differentiable flow, and across the whole thermodynamic state\nspace. This means that, no matter how fast the fluid expands or contracts, the\nhydrodynamic equations are always well-behaved (away from singularities).

To address this limitation, we propose Reinforcement\nLearning Constrained Beam Search (RLCBS) for inference-time refinement in\ncombinatorial optimization problems. This method respects flexible,\ninference-time constraints that support exclusion of invalid actions and forced\ninclusion of desired actions, and employs beam search to maximize sequence\nprobability for more sensible constraint incorporation.

A model is developed to describe quantitatively\nthe dispersion of the fluctuation relaxation rates. The model is based on a\nspecialization of the elastic free energy density of the smectic-C phase to the\ncase of 90 degree director tilt, a \"first-order\" approximation of the viscous\nstresses by their form for an incompressible uniaxial fluid, and a treatment of\nthe effect of chevron layer structure that develops in planar sample cells due\nto temperature-dependent layer shrinkage, as documented in previous studies on\nDIO.

Previous\nefforts to detect grooming in industry and academia have involved accessing and\nmonitoring private conversations through centrally-trained models or sending\nprivate conversations to a global server. In this work, we implement a\nprivacy-preserving pipeline for the early detection of sexual predators. We\nleverage federated learning and differential privacy in order to create safer\nonline spaces for children while respecting their privacy.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the development of a comprehensive dataset capturing\ninteractions between Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and traffic control devices,\nspecifically traffic lights and stop signs. Derived from the Waymo Motion\ndataset, our work addresses a critical gap in the existing literature by\nproviding real-world trajectory data on how AVs navigate these traffic control\ndevices. We propose a methodology for identifying and extracting relevant\ninteraction trajectory data from the Waymo Motion dataset, incorporating over\n37,000 instances with traffic lights and 44,000 with stop signs. Our\nmethodology includes defining rules to identify various interaction types,\nextracting trajectory data, and applying a wavelet-based denoising method to\nsmooth the acceleration and speed profiles and eliminate anomalous values,\nthereby enhancing the trajectory quality. Quality assessment metrics indicate\nthat trajectories obtained in this study have anomaly proportions in\nacceleration and jerk profiles reduced to near-zero levels across all\ninteraction categories. By making this dataset publicly available, we aim to\naddress the current gap in datasets containing AV interaction behaviors with\ntraffic lights and signs. Based on the organized and published dataset, we can\ngain a more in-depth understanding of AVs' behavior when interacting with\ntraffic lights and signs. This will facilitate research on AV integration into\nexisting transportation infrastructures and networks, supporting the\ndevelopment of more accurate behavioral models and simulation tools.",

However, recent works from other domains show that the\npre-training data distribution is an important factor influencing the\nperformance of the foundation models. With this motivation, our research\nexplores how the geographic distribution of pre-training data affects the\nperformance of GFMs. We evaluated several pre-training data distributions by\nsampling different compositions from a global data pool. Our experiments with\ntwo GFMs on downstream tasks indicate that balanced and globally representative\ndata compositions often outperform region-specific sampling, highlighting the\nimportance of diversity and global coverage in pre-training data. Our results\nsuggest that the most appropriate data sampling technique may depend on the\nspecific GFM architecture.

In the first\noptimization phase, PSO generates an approximate NURBS surface by optimizing\nits control points, aligning the surface with the LiDAR data, and providing a\nreliable starting point for refinement. The second phase uses NURBS-Diff, a\ndifferentiable programming framework, to enhance the accuracy of the initial\nfit by refining the surface geometry and capturing intricate leaf details. Our\nresults demonstrate that, while PSO establishes a robust initial fit, the\nintegration of differentiable NURBS significantly improves the overall quality\nand fidelity of the reconstructed surface. This hierarchical optimization\nstrategy enables accurate 3D reconstruction of maize leaves across diverse\ngenotypes, facilitating the subsequent extraction of complex traits like\nphyllotaxy.

First, we\nderive the velocity-equilibrium and pressure-equilibrium conditions of a\nstandard discontinuous Galerkin method that discretizes the conservative form\nof the compressible, multicomponent Euler equations. We show that under certain\nconstraints on the numerical flux, the scheme is\nvelocity-equilibrium-preserving. However, standard discontinuous Galerkin\nschemes are not pressure-equilibrium-preserving. Therefore, we introduce a\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method that discretizes the pressure-evolution equation\nin place of the total-energy conservation equation. Semidiscrete conservation\nof total energy, which would otherwise be lost, is restored via the correction\nterms of [Abgrall, J. Comput. Phys., 372, 2018, pp. 640-666] and [Abgrall et\nal., J.

Since the addition of the correction\nterms prevents exact preservation of pressure and velocity equilibria, we\npropose modifications that then lead to a velocity-equilibrium-preserving,\npressure-equilibrium-preserving, and (semidiscretely) energy-conservative\ndiscontinuous Galerkin scheme, although there are certain tradeoffs. Additional\nextensions are also introduced.

    "abstract": "With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, ultrasound imaging has emerged as a\npromising technique for COVID-19 detection, due to its non-invasive nature,\naffordability, and portability. In response, researchers have focused on\ndeveloping AI-based scoring systems to provide real-time diagnostic support.\nHowever, the limited size and lack of proper annotation in publicly available\nultrasound datasets pose significant challenges for training a robust AI model.\nThis paper proposes MeDiVLAD, a novel pipeline to address the above issue for\nmulti-level lung-ultrasound (LUS) severity scoring. In particular, we leverage\nself-knowledge distillation to pretrain a vision transformer (ViT) without\nlabel and aggregate frame-level features via dual-level VLAD aggregation. We\nshow that with minimal finetuning, MeDiVLAD outperforms conventional\nfully-supervised methods in both frame- and video-level scoring, while offering\nclassification reasoning with exceptional quality. This superior performance\nenables key applications such as the automatic identification of critical lung\npathology areas and provides a robust solution for broader medical video\nclassification tasks.",

In recent years, diffusion models have shown promising results in\naccelerating the drug design process through AI-driven molecular generation.\nHowever, training these models requires massive amounts of data, which are\noften isolated in proprietary silos.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel method for numerically stabilizing sequential\ncontinuous adjoint flow solvers utilizing an elliptic relaxation strategy. The\nproposed approach is formulated as a Partial Differential Equation (PDE)\ncontaining a single user-defined parameter, which analytical investigations\nreveal to represent the filter width of a probabilistic density function or\nGaussian kernel. Key properties of the approach include (a) smoothing features\nwith redistribution capabilities while (b) preserving integral properties. The\ntechnique targets explicit adjoint cross-coupling terms, such as the Adjoint\nTranspose Convection (ATC) term, which frequently causes numerical\ninstabilities, especially on unstructured grids common in industrial\napplications. A trade-off is made by sacrificing sensitivity consistency to\nachieve enhanced numerical robustness.\n  The method is validated on a two-phase, laminar, two-dimensional cylinder\nflow test case at Re=20 and Fn=0.75, focusing on minimizing resistance or\nmaximizing lift. A range of homogeneous and inhomogeneous filter widths is\nevaluated. Subsequently, the relaxation method is employed to stabilize adjoint\nsimulations during shape optimizations that aim at drag reduction of ship\nhulls. Two case studies are considered: A model-scale bulk carrier traveling at\nRe=7.246E+06 and Fn=0.142 as well as a harbor ferry cruising at Re=2.43E+08 and\nFn=0.4 in full-scale conditions. Both cases, characterized by unstructured\ngrids prone to adjoint divergence, demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method in overcoming stability challenges.

This enables the integration of forcing terms and\nnatural boundary conditions into the loss function similar to conventional\nfinite element method (FEM) solvers, facilitating its optimization, and\nextending its applicability to more complex problems, which will ease\nindustrial adoption. This study will elaborate on the derivation of FENNM,\nhighlighting its similarities with FEM. Additionally, it will provide insights\ninto optimal utilization strategies and user guidelines to ensure\ncost-efficiency. Finally, the study illustrates the robustness and accuracy of\nFENNM by presenting multiple numerical case studies and applying adaptive mesh\nrefinement techniques.",

At such short periods, a\nfraction of the strong stellar wind from the stripped helium stars may be\naccreted by the black holes, and its gravitational potential energy may be\nreleased as observable radiation in the X-ray regime. We estimate the X-ray\nluminosity and its observability from black holes in orbit with stripped helium\nstars, which evolve into binary black hole or black hole+neutron star binaries\nthat merge within Hubble time. We post-process recent advancements for\nestimating X-ray luminosities (via wind accretion onto stellar mass black\nholes) into two rapid population synthesis codes, BSE and StarTrack. We derive\nlower limits on the X-ray luminosity distribution from populations of stripped\nhelium+black hole binaries at four metallicities (0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1\n$Z_{\\odot}$) and two mass transfer stability criteria. We find that a large\nfraction (0.1-0.5) of stripped-helium stars that get spun up by tides also\ntransfer enough wind matter onto the black hole to produce X-ray luminosities\nabove $10^{35}$\\,erg\\,s$^{-1}$, up to $\\sim10^{39}$\\,erg\\,s$^{-1}$.

Platforms such as IBM Quantum\nand Amazon Braket exemplify this trend, enabling access to diverse quantum\nbackends. However, efficient resource management remains a challenge, as\nquantum processors are highly susceptible to noise, which significantly impacts\ncomputation fidelity. Additionally, the heterogeneous noise characteristics\nacross different processors add further complexity to scheduling and resource\nallocation. Existing scheduling strategies typically focus on mapping and\nscheduling jobs to these heterogeneous backends, which leads to some jobs\nsuffering extremely low fidelity. Targeting quantum optimization jobs (e.g.,\nVQC, VQE, QAOA) - among the most promising quantum applications in the NISQ era\n- we hypothesize that executing the later stages of a job on a high-fidelity\nquantum processor can significantly improve overall fidelity. To verify this,\nwe use VQE as a case study and develop a Genetic Algorithm-based scheduling\nframework that incorporates job splitting to optimize fidelity and throughput.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently maintains high\nfidelity across all jobs while significantly enhancing system throughput.\nFurthermore, the proposed algorithm exhibits excellent scalability in handling\nan increasing number of quantum processors and larger workloads, making it a\nrobust and practical solution for emerging quantum computing platforms.

An\nexample of these features is represented by repeated, mechanically impressed\npatterns, called punches, present chiefly in 13th and 14th-century panel\npaintings from Tuscany.

    "abstract": "Brain imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of various\nneurological disorders, providing valuable insights into the structure and\nfunction of the brain. Techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and\ncomputed tomography (CT) enable non-invasive visualization of the brain, aiding\nin the understanding of brain anatomy, abnormalities, and functional\nconnectivity. However, cost and radiation dose may limit the acquisition of\nspecific image modalities, so medical image synthesis can be used to generate\nrequired medical images without actual addition. In the medical domain, where\nobtaining labeled medical images is labor-intensive and expensive, addressing\ndata scarcity is a major challenge. Recent studies propose using transfer\nlearning to overcome this issue. This involves adapting pre-trained CycleGAN\nmodels, initially trained on non-medical data, to generate realistic medical\nimages. In this work, transfer learning was applied to the task of MR-CT image\ntranslation and vice versa using 18 pre-trained non-medical models, and the\nmodels were fine-tuned to have the best result. The models' performance was\nevaluated using four widely used image quality metrics:\nPeak-signal-to-noise-ratio, Structural Similarity Index, Universal Quality\nIndex, and Visual Information Fidelity. Quantitative evaluation and qualitative\nperceptual analysis by radiologists demonstrate the potential of transfer\nlearning in medical imaging and the effectiveness of the generic pre-trained\nmodel. The results provide compelling evidence of the model's exceptional\nperformance, which can be attributed to the high quality and similarity of the\ntraining images to actual human brain images. These results underscore the\nsignificance of carefully selecting appropriate and representative training\nimages to optimize performance in brain image analysis tasks.",

The reduction of the absorption depths\nlikely indicates dilution of the absorption features by thermal emission of\ndust grains newly formed at such a radius and heated by radiation from the\ncentral star. The broad absorption feature at 1.53 um is significantly deeper\nthan in template carbon stars, consistent with the presence of a substantial\namount of circumstellar material around CW Leo. Its northeastern quadrant lacks\ncircumstellar absorption features and scattered light in the near-infrared\nregime, which are possibly manifestations of its conical cavity in both gas and\ndust.

Edge robot systems such as\nsmall drones need to execute complex maneuvers at high-speeds with limited\nresources, which places strict constraints on the underlying algorithms and\nhardware. Traditionally, frame-based cameras are used for vision-based\nperception due to their rich spatial information and simplified synchronous\nsensing capabilities. However, obtaining detailed information across frames\nincurs high energy consumption and may not even be required. In addition, their\nlow temporal resolution renders them ineffective in high-speed motion\nscenarios. Event-based cameras offer a biologically-inspired solution to this\nby capturing only changes in intensity levels at exceptionally high temporal\nresolution and low power consumption, making them ideal for high-speed motion\nscenarios.

A novel slot\ncontrastive loss further reduces redundancy and improves the representation\ndisentanglement by enhancing slot orthogonality. We evaluate Slot-BERT on\nreal-world surgical video datasets from abdominal, cholecystectomy, and\nthoracic procedures.

    "abstract": "The buckling behavior of cylindrical shells has gained significant interest\nover the past century due to its rich nonlinear behavior and broad engineering\napplications. While the buckling of cylindrical shells under a single load\n(e.g., compression or torsion) has been extensively studied, the buckling\nbehavior under combined torsional and axial loads remains largely unexplored.\nIn this paper, based on a combination of experiments, theoretical modeling, and\nfinite element simulations, we systematically investigate the buckling and\npost-buckling behavior of cylindrical shells under combined torsional and axial\nloads. Three different types of combined loads are considered: compression with\npre-torsion, torsion with pre-tension, and torsion with pre-compression. The\ntheoretical model is established within the framework of the Donnell shell\ntheory and solved using the Galerkin method, through which the critical\nbuckling load, critical circumferential wavenumber, buckling pattern, and\npost-buckling equilibrium path of clamped-clamped thin cylindrical shells under\nvarious types of loads can be determined. The theoretical predictions agree\nwell with finite element simulations and qualitatively capture the various\nbuckling phenomena observed in the experiments. It is found that cylindrical\nshells exhibit quite different post-buckling behavior under combined loads\ncompared to under a single compressive or torsional load. For instance, when a\nclamped-clamped thin cylindrical shell is subjected to pure torsion or torsion\nwith a relatively small pre-compression, it consistently shows a\ndiagonal-shaped pattern during deformation. However, with a relatively large\npre-compression, the shell transitions from a diagonal-shaped pattern to a\ntwisted diamond-shaped pattern.",

In this system, a monitor not only receives signal from\nsuspicious transmitter via a RIS-enhanced legitimate surveillance (LS) link but\nalso simultaneously takes control of multiple jammers to degrade the quality of\nreceived suspicious signal. Under this setup, to enhance monitoring performance\nrequires improvements of both the received signal quality at the monitor and\nthe cooperative jamming (CJ). Considering that the surveillance system is aided\nby one RIS, whose phase shift optimization involves both channel state\ninformation (CSI) of the LS and CJ links, we utilize partial CSI to alleviate\nthe CSI acquisition burden in our design. We propose two RIS-aided monitoring\nschemes with optimal jammer selection (OJS), and derive their closed-form\nexpressions of surveillance success probability (SSP), respectively.\nFurthermore, we consider RIS-aided monitoring schemes with random jammer\nselection as corresponding benchmarks. Thereafter, we analyze special cases\nwhere the jammers are using power control to avoid being found, making it\nappears like passive monitoring. Also, the effect of RIS is highlighted by\nconsidering asymptotically large number of RIS elements. Numerical results\nverify that the proposed OJS strategy further enhances the RIS-aided monitoring\nperformance compared with non-jammer-selection RISLR and RISCR schemes, where\nthe superiority comes at the cost of CSI knowledge and becomes marginal in the\nregion of high jamming power. In addition, the RISLO shows surveillance\nperformance advantage overRISCOwhen the suspicious power is low or when the\nnumber of RIS elements is large.",

    "abstract": "Capability jobs (e.g., large, long-running tasks) and capacity jobs (e.g.,\nsmall, short-running tasks) are two common types of workloads in\nhigh-performance computing (HPC). Different HPC systems are typically deployed\nto handle distinct computing workloads. For example, Theta at the Argonne\nLeadership Computing Facility (ALCF) primarily serves capability jobs, while\nCori at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)\npredominantly handles capacity workloads. However, this segregation often leads\nto inefficient resource utilization and higher costs due to the need for\noperating separate computing platforms. This work examines what-if scenarios\nfor integrating siloed platforms. Specifically, we collect and characterize two\nreal workloads from production systems at DOE laboratories, representing\ncapabilitypredominant and capacity-predominant computing, respectively. We\ninvestigate two approaches to unification. Workload fusion explores how\nefficiently resources are utilized when a unified system accommodates diverse\nworkloads, whereas workload injection identifies opportunities to enhance\nresource utilization on capability computing systems by leveraging capacity\njobs. Finally, through extensive trace-based, event-driven simulations, we\nexplore the potential benefits of co-scheduling both types of jobs on a unified\nsystem to enhance resource utilization and reduce costs, offering new insights\nfor future research in unified computing.",

    "abstract": "We present time-resolved Gran Telescopio Canarias optical spectroscopy and\nWilliam Herschel Telescope $i$-band photometry of the X-ray transient SWIFT\nJ1753.5-0127 in quiescence. The $i$-band light curve is dominated by flickering\nwith an amplitude of $\\sim 0.5$ mag and shows no evidence of the ellipsoidal\nmodulation of the companion star. The telluric-corrected average spectrum, on\nthe other hand, reveals the presence of weak (strongly veiled) TiO bands at\n$7055$ \\.A and $7589$ \\.A. We used them for a spectral classification, finding\nan M4-5 V companion star. However, as velocity shifts are not clearly detected\nin the individual spectra, we turned the analysis to the double-peaked\nH$\\alpha$ emission line from the accretion disc. By exploiting the empirical\ncorrelations established for quiescent X-ray transients between the line\nmorphology and fundamental binary parameters, we estimated the radial velocity\nsemi-amplitude of the companion $K_2 = 820 \\pm 36$ km s$^{-1}$, a mass ratio $q\n= 0.023 \\pm 0.006$ and an inclination $i = 79 \\pm 5$ deg. Moreover, an orbital\nperiod of $3.26 \\pm 0.02$ h was measured from the modulation of the centroid\nvelocities and the double-peak trough depth of the H$\\alpha$ profile. These\nquantities yielded a mass function $f(M_1) = 7.8 \\pm 1.0$ M$_\\odot$ and black\nhole and companion star masses of $M_1 = 8.8 \\pm 1.3$ M$_\\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.20\n\\pm 0.06$ M$_\\odot$, respectively. The companion star mass is in line with the\nspectral classification obtained from the relative depth of the TiO bands.\nBased on the mean quiescent magnitude ($i = 21.4 \\pm 0.1$), orbital period, and\ninterstellar extinction, we estimate the distance to the source to be $3.9 \\pm\n0.7$ kpc and a Galactic plane elevation of $0.8 \\pm 0.2$ kpc, supporting the\ncase for a large natal kick.",

Focusing on a local $U(1)$ charge, we consider symmetric initial states\nevolved by both local one-dimensional circuits and geometrically non-local RUCs\nmade of two-qudit gates. We compute the entanglement asymmetry of subsystems of\narbitrary size, analyzing the relaxation time scales. We show that the\nentanglement asymmetry of the whole system approaches its stationary value in a\ntime independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits. For\nsubsystems, we find qualitative differences depending on their size. When the\nsubsystem is larger than half of the full system, the equilibration time scales\nare again independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits\nand the entanglement asymmetry grows monotonically in time. Conversely, when\nthe subsystems are smaller than half of the full system, we show that the\nentanglement asymmetry is non-monotonic in time and that it equilibrates in a\ntime proportional to the quantum-information scrambling time, providing a\nphysical intuition. As a consequence, the subsystem-equilibration time depends\non the locality of interactions, scaling linearly and logarithmically in the\nsystem size, respectively, for local and non-local RUCs.

In contrast, attraction enhancement (like antiscreening in\nchromodynamics) makes the spectrum less steep in the focusing case. To describe\nstrong turbulence, we consider a vector model in the limit of a large number of\ncomponents. A large-N kinetic equation, valid at all scales, can be derived\nanalytically. It has an inverse-cascade solution whose two asymptotics, at high\nand low wavenumbers, describe weak and strong turbulence, respectively.

Such\na strong variability amplitude has not been observed before among $z>6$ QSOs,\nand the underlying physical mechanism was unclear.

Comparing with the 2018 epoch, the 0.5-2 keV flux dropped dramatically\nby a factor $>20$. We ascribe this behaviour to intervening, and still ongoing,\nobscuration by Compton-thick gas intercepting our line of sight between 2018\nand 2021.

Here we study band-off-diagonal\npairing within Eliashberg theory. We show that despite the additional frequency\ndependence, the leading-order description of both intervalley coherent\nfluctuations or intervalley phonons exhibits a symmetry prohibiting admixture\nof an intraband component to the interband pairing state. It is found that\neven- and odd-frequency pairing mix, which originates from the reduced number\nof flavor degrees of freedom in the normal state. From analytic continuation,\nwe obtain the electronic spectral function showing that, also within Eliashberg\ntheory, the interband nature leads to an enhanced spectral weight below the\norder-parameter energy compared to band-diagonal pairing. Finally, we also\nstudy the superfluid stiffness of band-off-diagonal pairing, taking into\naccount multi-band and quantum geometry effects. It is shown that for $s$-wave\nand chiral momentum dependencies, conventionally leading to fully gapped\nphases, an interband structure reduces the temperature scale below which the\nstiffness saturates. Depending on parameters, for the chiral state, this scale\ncan even be suppressed all the way to zero temperature leading to a complex\ncompetition of multiple dispersive and geometrical contributions.

    "abstract": "Gaia data have revealed vertically asymmetric phase-space structures in the\nMilky Way (MW) disc, such as phase spirals, indicating vertical oscillations.\nThese oscillations exhibit two distinct modes: the bending mode and the\nbreathing mode, associated with one-arm and two-arm phase spirals,\nrespectively. This study aims to explore the excitation mechanisms of the\nbending and breathing modes and their subsequent evolution in the MW disc,\nfocusing on the interplay between direct perturbations from the Sagittarius\ndwarf galaxy and indirect contributions from tidally induced spiral arms. We\nperform high-resolution $N$-body simulations to model the interaction between\nan MW-like disc galaxy and a Sagittarius dwarf-like satellite. These\nsimulations resolve fine phase-space structures, enabling analysis of the\nbending and breathing modes at both macroscopic (global bending and breathing\nwaves) and microscopic (local phase spirals) scales. Our simulations\ndemonstrate that the satellite's perturbation directly excites the bending mode\nand induces spiral arms in the galactic disc. These spiral arms excite the\nbreathing mode, making it an indirect consequence of the satellite interaction.\nInitially, the bending mode dominates, but it rapidly decays due to horizontal\nmixing. In contrast, the breathing mode persists for a longer duration,\nsustained by the spiral arms, leading to a transition from a bending-dominated\nto a breathing-dominated state. This transition progresses faster in the inner\ngalaxy than in the outer regions. The simulations reproduce the one-arm phase\nspiral observed in the solar neighbourhood and reveal two-arm phase spirals,\nparticularly in the inner galaxy, associated with spiral arm-induced breathing\nmodes. Our findings highlight the combined effects of direct satellite\nperturbations and indirect spiral arm dynamics in shaping the vertical\nstructure of the MW disc.",

    "abstract": "In holographic theories, the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) area operator\nplays a key role in our understanding of the emergence of semiclassical\nEinstein-Hilbert gravity. When higher derivative corrections are included, the\nrole of the area is instead played by a more general functional known as the\ngeometric entropy. It is thus of interest to understand the flow generated by\nthe geometric entropy on the classical phase space. In particular, the fact\nthat the associated flow in Einstein-Hilbert or Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity\ninduces a relative boost between the left and right entanglement wedges is\ndeeply related to the fact that gravitational dressing promotes the von Neumann\nalgebra of local fields in each wedge to type II. This relative boost is known\nas a boundary-condition-preserving (BCP) kink-transformation. In a general\ntheory of gravity (with arbitrary higher-derivative terms), it is\nstraightforward to show that the flow continues to take the above geometric\nform when acting on a spacetime where the HRT surface is the bifurcation\nsurface of a Killing horizon. However, the form of the flow on other spacetimes\nis less clear.\n  In this paper, we use the manifestly-covariant Peierls bracket to explore\nsuch flows in two-dimensional theories of JT gravity coupled to matter fields\nwith higher derivative interactions. The results no longer take a purely\ngeometric form and, instead, demonstrate new features that should be expected\nof such flows in general higher derivative theories.

We consider the\nstandard cold dark matter model and five variations, including three warm dark\nmatter scenarios and two self-interacting models with constant or\nvelocity-dependent cross-section. In each model, we simulate two cosmological\nboxes of 51.7 and 110.7 Mpc on a side, with the same initial conditions as\nTNG50 and TNG100, and combine the variations in the physics of dark matter with\nthe fiducial IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. The AIDA-TNG runs are thus\nideal for studying the simultaneous effect of baryons and alternative dark\nmatter models on observable properties of galaxies and large-scale structures.\nWe resolve haloes in the range between $10^{8}$ and\n$4\\times10^{14}\\,$M$_{\\odot}$ and scales down to the nominal resolution of 570\npc in the highest resolution runs. This work presents the first results on\nstatistical quantities such as the halo mass function and the matter power\nspectrum; we quantify the modification in the number of haloes and the power on\nscales smaller than 1 Mpc, due to the combination of baryonic and dark matter\nphysics. Despite being calibrated on cold dark matter, we find that the TNG\ngalaxy formation model can produce a realistic galaxy population in all\nscenarios. The stellar and gas mass fraction, stellar mass function, black hole\nmass as a function of stellar mass and star formation rate density are very\nsimilar in all dark matter models, with some deviations only in the most\nextreme warm dark matter model. Finally, we also quantify changes in halo\nstructure due to warm and self-interacting dark matter, which appear in the\ndensity profiles, concentration-mass relation and galaxy sizes.",

In this\nwork, we present a way to train a segmentation network using long-term point\ntrajectories as a supervisory signal to complement optical flow. The key\ndifficulty is that long-term motion, unlike instantaneous motion, is difficult\nto model -- any parametric approximation is unlikely to capture complex motion\npatterns over long periods of time.

In this work, we believe problem-solving starts with\nidentification, yielding the request that the model should be aware of not just\nthe presence of defects in an image, but their specific locations. Motivated by\nthis, we propose DiffDoctor, a two-stage pipeline to assist image diffusion\nmodels in generating fewer artifacts. Concretely, the first stage targets\ndeveloping a robust artifact detector, for which we collect a dataset of over\n1M flawed synthesized images and set up an efficient human-in-the-loop\nannotation process, incorporating a carefully designed class-balance strategy.\nThe learned artifact detector is then involved in the second stage to optimize\nthe diffusion model by providing pixel-level feedback. Extensive experiments on\ntext-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness of our artifact\ndetector as well as the soundness of our diagnose-then-treat design.",

Assuming that the representation of $G$ is irreducible, we\nfirst give explicit expressions for the optimal success probability of\ndiscriminating the GU states, and optimal measurements achieving this value, in\nterms of the largest eigenvalue of the generator state and its associated\neigenspace. A particular optimal measurement can be understood as the limit of\nweighted \"pretty good measurements\" (PGM). This naturally provides examples of\nstate discrimination for which the unweighted PGM is provably sub-optimal. We\nextend this analysis to certain reducible representations, and use Schur-Weyl\nduality to discuss two particular examples of GU ensembles in terms of\nWerner-type and permutation-invariant generator states. For the case of\npure-state GU ensembles we give a new streamlined proof of optimality of the\nPGM first proved in [Eldar et al., 2004].

    "abstract": "Despite the promising performance of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in\nvisual understanding, they occasionally generate incorrect outputs. While\nreward models (RMs) with reinforcement learning or test-time scaling offer the\npotential for improving generation quality, a critical gap remains: publicly\navailable multi-modal RMs for LVLMs are scarce, and the implementation details\nof proprietary models are often unclear. We bridge this gap with\nInternLM-XComposer2.5-Reward (IXC-2.5-Reward), a simple yet effective\nmulti-modal reward model that aligns LVLMs with human preferences. To ensure\nthe robustness and versatility of IXC-2.5-Reward, we set up a high-quality\nmulti-modal preference corpus spanning text, image, and video inputs across\ndiverse domains, such as instruction following, general understanding,\ntext-rich documents, mathematical reasoning, and video understanding.\nIXC-2.5-Reward achieves excellent results on the latest multi-modal reward\nmodel benchmark and shows competitive performance on text-only reward model\nbenchmarks. We further demonstrate three key applications of IXC-2.5-Reward:\n(1) Providing a supervisory signal for RL training. We integrate IXC-2.5-Reward\nwith Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) yields IXC-2.5-Chat, which shows\nconsistent improvements in instruction following and multi-modal open-ended\ndialogue; (2) Selecting the best response from candidate responses for\ntest-time scaling; and (3) Filtering outlier or noisy samples from existing\nimage and video instruction tuning training data.

Previous\nstudies have shown that, under the sparsity assumption, the Fourier transform\ncan be computed efficiently using fast and sample-efficient algorithms.\nHowever, in most practical settings, the function is defined over a more\ngeneral space -- the space of generalized $q$-ary sequences $\\mathbb{Z}_{q_1}\n\\times \\mathbb{Z}_{q_2} \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{q_n}$ -- where each\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{q_i}$ corresponds to integers modulo $q_i$. Herein, we develop\nGFast, a coding theoretic algorithm that computes the $S$-sparse Fourier\ntransform of $f$ with a sample complexity of $O(Sn)$, computational complexity\nof $O(Sn \\log N)$, and a failure probability that approaches zero as\n$N=\\prod_{i=1}^n q_i \\rightarrow \\infty$ with $S = N^\\delta$ for some $0 \\leq\n\\delta < 1$. We show that a noise-robust version of GFast computes the\ntransform with a sample complexity of $O(Sn^2)$ and computational complexity of\n$O(Sn^2 \\log N)$ under the same high probability guarantees. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate that GFast computes the sparse Fourier transform of generalized\n$q$-ary functions $8\\times$ faster using $16\\times$ fewer samples on synthetic\nexperiments, and enables explaining real-world heart disease diagnosis and\nprotein fitness models using up to $13\\times$ fewer samples compared to\nexisting Fourier algorithms applied to the most efficient parameterization of\nthe models as $q$-ary functions.",

    "abstract": "Resilience of safety-critical systems is gaining importance, particularly\nwith the increasing number of cyber and physical threats. Cyber-physical\nthreats are becoming increasingly prevalent, as digital systems are ubiquitous\nin critical infrastructure. The challenge with determining the resilience of\ncyber-physical systems is identifying a set of resilience metrics that can\nadapt to the changing states of the system. A static resilience metric can lead\nto an inaccurate estimation of system state, and can result in unintended\nconsequences against cyber threats. In this work, we propose a data-driven\nmethod for adaptive resilience metric learning. The primary goal is to learn a\nsingle resilience metric by formulating an inverse reinforcement learning\nproblem that learns a reward or objective from a set of control actions from an\nexpert. It learns the structure or parameters of the reward function based on\ninformation provided by expert demonstrations. Most prior work has considered\nstatic weights or theories from fuzzy logic to formulate a single resilience\nmetric. Instead, this work learns the resilience metric, represented as reward\nfunction, using adversarial inverse reinforcement learning, to determine the\noptimal policy through training the generator discriminator in parallel. We\nevaluate our proposed technique in scenarios such as optimal communication\nnetwork rerouting, power distribution network reconfiguration, and a combined\ncyber-physical restoration of critical load using the IEEE 123-bus system.",

Approaches based on proper orthogonal\ndecomposition have been widely investigated in the literature, but they usually\nrely on some \\emph{a-priori} knowledge about the bifurcating model and lack any\nerror estimation. On the other hand, standard certified reduced basis\ntechniques fail to represent correctly the branching behavior, since the error\nestimator is no longer reliable. The main goal of the contribution is to\novercome these limitations by introducing two novel algorithms: (i) the\nadaptive-greedy, detecting the bifurcation point starting from scarce\ninformation over the parametric space, and (ii) the deflated-greedy, certifying\nmultiple coexisting branches simultaneously. The former approach takes\nadvantage of the features of the reduced manifold to detect the bifurcation,\nwhile the latter exploits the deflation and continuation methods to discover\nthe bifurcating solutions and enrich the reduced space. We test the two\nstrategies for the Coanda effect held by the Navier-Stokes equations in a\nsudden-expansion channel.

    "abstract": "Inferring the true demand for a product or a service from aggregate data is\noften challenging due to the limited available supply, thus resulting in\nobservations that are censored and correspond to the realized demand, thereby\nnot accounting for the unsatisfied demand. Censored regression models are able\nto account for the effect of censoring due to the limited supply, but they\ndon't consider the effect of substitutions, which may cause the demand for\nsimilar alternative products or services to increase. This paper proposes\nDiffusion-aware Censored Demand Models, which combine a Tobit likelihood with a\ngraph diffusion process in order to model the latent process of transfer of\nunsatisfied demand between similar products or services. We instantiate this\nnew class of models under the framework of GPs and, based on both simulated and\nreal-world data for modeling sales, bike-sharing demand, and EV charging\ndemand, demonstrate its ability to better recover the true demand and produce\nmore accurate out-of-sample predictions.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel semi-self sensing hybrid reconfigurable\nintelligent surface (SS-HRIS) in terahertz (THz) bands, where the RIS is\nequipped with reflecting elements divided between passive and active elements\nin addition to sensing elements. SS-HRIS along with integrated sensing and\ncommunications (ISAC) can help to mitigate the multipath attenuation that is\nabundant in THz bands. In our proposed scheme, sensors are configured at the\nSS-HRIS to receive the radar echo signal from a target. A joint base station\n(BS) beamforming and HRIS precoding matrix optimization problem is proposed to\nmaximize the sum rate of communication users while maintaining satisfactory\nsensing performance measured by the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the\ndirection of angles of arrival (AoA) of the echo signal and thermal noise at\nthe target. The CRB expression is first derived and the sum rate maximization\nproblem is formulated subject to communication and sensing performance\nconstraints. To solve the complex non-convex optimization problem, deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nalgorithm is proposed, where the reward function, the action space and the\nstate space are modeled. Simulation results show that the proposed DDPG-based\nDRL algorithm converges well and achieves better performance than several\nbaselines, such as the soft actor-critic (SAC), proximal policy optimization\n(PPO), greedy algorithm and random BS beamforming and HRIS precoding matrix\nschemes. Moreover, it demonstrates that adopting HRIS significantly enhances\nthe achievable sum rate compared to passive RIS and random BS beamforming and\nHRIS precoding matrix schemes.",

However, rapid\nadvancements have produced a diversity of seemingly unrelated architectures,\nsuch as Transformers and recurrent alternatives. In this paper, we introduce a\nunifying framework to understand and derive these sequence models, inspired by\nthe empirical importance of associative recall, the capability to retrieve\ncontextually relevant tokens. We formalize associative recall as a two-step\nprocess, memorization and retrieval, casting memorization as a regression\nproblem. Layers that combine these two steps perform associative recall via\n``test-time regression'' over its input tokens. Prominent layers, including\nlinear attention, state-space models, fast-weight programmers, online learners,\nand softmax attention, arise as special cases defined by three design choices:\nthe regression weights, the regressor function class, and the test-time\noptimization algorithm. Our approach clarifies how linear attention fails to\ncapture inter-token correlations and offers a mathematical justification for\nthe empirical effectiveness of query-key normalization in softmax attention.\nFurther, it illuminates unexplored regions within the design space, which we\nuse to derive novel higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond\nunification, our work bridges sequence modeling with classic regression\nmethods, a field with extensive literature, paving the way for developing more\npowerful and theoretically principled architectures.",

This is a challenging\nproblem, particularly for high-order unstructured meshes partitioned in\nparallel with MPI, as it requires identifying the element that overlaps a given\npoint and computing the corresponding reference space coordinates. We present a\nrobust and efficient technique for general field evaluation in large-scale\nhigh-order meshes with quadrilaterals and hexahedra. In the proposed method, a\ncombination of globally partitioned and processor-local maps are used to first\ndetermine a list of candidate MPI ranks, and then locally candidate elements\nthat could contain a given point. Next, element-wise bounding boxes further\nreduce the list of candidate elements. Finally, Newton's method with trust\nregion is used to determine the overlapping element and corresponding reference\nspace coordinates. Since GPU-based architectures have become popular for\naccelerating computational analyses using meshes with tensor-product elements,\nspecialized kernels have been developed to utilize the proposed methodology on\nGPUs. The method is also extended to enable general field evaluation on surface\nmeshes.

While the primary goal of CL is to maximize the expected accuracy gain\nfor each participant, it is also important to ensure that the gains are fairly\ndistributed. Specifically, no client should be negatively impacted by the\ncollaboration, and the individual gains must ideally be commensurate with the\ncontributions. Most existing CL algorithms require central coordination and\nfocus on the gain maximization objective while ignoring collaborative fairness.\nIn this work, we first show that the existing measure of collaborative fairness\nbased on the correlation between accuracy values without and with collaboration\nhas drawbacks because it does not account for negative collaboration gain. We\nargue that maximizing mean collaboration gain (MCG) while simultaneously\nminimizing the collaboration gain spread (CGS) is a fairer alternative. Next,\nwe propose the CYCle protocol that enables individual participants in a private\ndecentralized learning (PDL) framework to achieve this objective through a\nnovel reputation scoring method based on gradient alignment between the local\ncross-entropy and distillation losses. Experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,\nand Fed-ISIC2019 datasets empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nCYCle protocol to ensure positive and fair collaboration gain for all\nparticipants, even in cases where the data distributions of participants are\nhighly skewed.

These structures, which\nare ubiquitous in the observations made by Parker Solar Probe, likely have\ntheir seed in the lower solar corona, where small-scale events driven by\nmagnetic reconnection could provide conditions ripe for either direct or\nindirect generation. We investigated potential links between in situ\nmeasurements of switchbacks and eruptions originating from the clusters of\nsmall-scale coronal loops known as coronal bright points to establish whether\nthese eruptions act as precursors to switchbacks. We traced solar wind\nswitchbacks from PSP back to their source regions using the ballistic\nback-mapping and potential field source surface methods, and analyzed the\ninfluence of the source surface height and solar wind propagation velocity on\nmagnetic connectivity. Using EUV images, we combined automated and visual\napproaches to identify small-scale eruptions in the source regions. We find\nthat the source region connected to the spacecraft varies significantly\ndepending on the source surface height, which exceeds the expected dependence\non the solar cycle and cannot be detected via polarity checks. For two\ncorotation periods that are straightforwardly connected, we find a matching\nlevel of activity (jets and switchbacks), which is characterized by the hourly\nrate of events and depends on the size of the region connected to PSP. However,\nno correlation is found between the two time series of hourly event rates.\nModeling constraints and the event selection may be the main limitations in the\ninvestigation of a possible correlation. Evolutionary phenomena occurring\nduring the solar wind propagation may also influence our results.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new achievable scheme for the K-user Linear Computation\nBroadcast Channel (K-LCBC). A K-LCBC comprises data stored on a server and K\nusers, each aiming to retrieve a desired linear function of the data by\nleveraging their prior locally available side information in the form of\nanother linear function of the data. The proposed scheme is based on a subspace\ndecomposition derived from representable polymatroid spaces. This decomposition\nenables the server to effectively design multicast messages that simultaneously\nbenefit multiple users and allow users to eliminate interference using their\navailable side information. This work extends existing results for the 3-LCBC\nby introducing a linear programming framework to optimize multicast\nopportunities across an arbitrary number of users. The proposed approach can be\nused to derive achievable scheme for the K-user coded caching problem with\nlinear coded placement and scalar linear function retrieval, which was our\noriginal motivation to investigate the K-LCBC.",

The existence of a constant factor\napproximation for the general graphs is still unknown.\n  In this paper, we study the problem in two simple families of sparse graphs,\nnamely, cacti and graphs of bounded pathwidth. There have been several efforts\nto understand the complexity of the problem in cactus graphs, mostly\nestablishing the presence of polynomial-time solutions for restricted families\nof cactus graphs. Despite these efforts, the complexity of the problem in\narbitrary cactus graphs remained open. We settle this question by establishing\nthe NP-completeness of telephone broadcasting in cactus graphs. For that, we\nshow the problem is NP-complete in a simple subfamily of cactus graphs, which\nwe call snowflake graphs. These graphs not only are cacti but also have\npathwidth 2.

    "abstract": "Many strong simulated galactic bars experience buckling instability, which\nmanifests itself as a vertical distortion out of the disk plane, and later\ndissipates. Using a simulation of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy, I\ndemonstrate that the phenomenon can be divided into two distinct phases. In the\nfirst one, the distortion grows and its pattern speed remains equal to the\npattern speed of the bar, so that the distortion remains stationary in the\nreference frame of the bar. The growth can be described with the mechanism of a\ndriven harmonic oscillator with time-dependent force, which decreases the\nvertical frequencies of the stars. At the end of this phase, most\nbar-supporting orbits have banana-like shapes with a resonant\nvertical-to-horizontal frequency ratio close to two. The increase of amplitudes\nof vertical oscillations leads to the decrease of the amplitudes of horizontal\noscillations and the shrinking of the bar. The mass redistribution causes the\nharmonic oscillators to respond adiabatically and increase the horizontal\nfrequencies. In the following second phase of buckling, the pattern speed of\nthe distortion increases - reaching one third of the circular frequency - but\nit decreases with radius. The distortion propagates as a kinematic bending wave\nand winds up, leaving behind a pronounced boxy/peanut shape. The increased\nhorizontal frequencies cause the weakening of the bar and the transformation of\nbanana-like orbits into pretzel-like ones, except in the outer part of the bar,\nwhere the banana-like orbits and the distortion survive. The results strongly\nsuggest that the buckling of galactic bars is not related to the fire-hose\ninstability, but it can be fully explained by the mechanism of vertical\nresonance creating the distortion that later winds up.",

    "abstract": "History-deterministic automata are a restricted class of nondeterministic\nautomata where the nondeterminism while reading an input can be resolved\nsuccessfully based on the prefix read so far. History-deterministic automata\nare exponentially more succinct than deterministic automata, while still\nretaining some of the algorithmic properties of deterministic automata,\nespecially in the context of reactive synthesis.\n  This thesis focuses on the problem of checking history-determinism for parity\nautomata. Our main result is the 2-token theorem, due to which we obtain that\nchecking history-determinism for parity automata with a fixed parity index can\nbe checked in PTIME. This improves the naive EXPTIME upper bound of Henzinger\nand Piterman that has stood since 2006. More precisely, we show that the\nso-called 2-token game, which can be solved in PTIME for parity automata with a\nfixed parity index, characterises history-determinism for parity automata. This\ngame was introduced by Bagnol and Kuperberg in 2018, who showed that to decide\nif a B\\\"uchi automaton is history-deterministic, it suffices to find the winner\nof the 2-token game on it. They conjectured that this 2-token game based\ncharacterisation of history-determinism extends to parity automata. We prove\nBagnol and Kuperberg's conjecture that the winner of the 2-token game\ncharacterises history-determinism on parity automata.\n  We also give a polynomial time determinisation procedure for\nhistory-deterministic B\\\"uchi automata, thus solving an open problem of\nKuperberg and Skrzypczak from 2015. This result is a consequence of our proof\nof the 2-token theorem.\n  Finally, we also show NP-hardness for the problem of checking\nhistory-determinism for parity automata when the parity index is not fixed.\nThis is an improvement from the lower bound of solving parity games shown by\nKuperberg and Skrzypczak in 2015.",

RALAD features three primary designs, including (1) domain adaptation via\nan enhanced Optimal Transport (OT) method that accounts for both individual and\ngrouped image distances, (2) a simple and unified framework that can be applied\nto various models, and (3) efficient fine-tuning techniques that freeze the\ncomputationally expensive layers while maintaining robustness. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that RALAD compensates for the performance degradation in\nsimulated environments while maintaining accuracy in real-world scenarios\nacross three different models. Taking Cross View as an example, the mIOU and\nmAP metrics in real-world scenarios remain stable before and after RALAD\nfine-tuning, while in simulated environments,the mIOU and mAP metrics are\nimproved by 10.30% and 12.29%, respectively.

Using\nDP-accelerated simulations, we reveal striking facet-dependent nanoparticle\nstability and mobility patterns across the three surfaces. The nanoparticles\ndiffuse several times faster on $\\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) than on\n$\\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) at 800 K while expected to be more sluggish based on\ntheir larger binding energy at 0 K. Diffusion is facilitated by dynamic\nmetal-support interaction (MSI), where the Al atoms switch out of the surface\nplane to optimize contact with the nanoparticle and relax back to the plane as\nthe nanoparticle moves away. In contrast, the MSI on $\\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100)\nand on $\\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(110) is dominated by more stable and directional\nCu-O bonds, consistent with the limited diffusion observed on these surfaces.\nOur extended long-time MD simulations provide quantitative insights into the\nsintering processes, showing that the dispersity of nanoparticles (the initial\ninter-nanoparticle distance) strongly influences coalescence driven by\nnanoparticle diffusion. We observed that the coalescence of Cu$_{13}$\nnanoparticles on $\\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) can occur in a short time (10 ns)\nat 800 K even with an initial inter-nanoparticle distance increased to 30\n\\r{A}, while the coalescence on $\\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) is inhibited\nsignificantly by increasing the initial inter-nanoparticle distance from 15\n\\r{A} to 30 \\r{A}.

Hanano\nand Jelly-No are one-player, 2D side-view puzzle games with a dynamic board\nconsisting of coloured, movable blocks disposed on platforms. These blocks can\nbe moved by the player and are subject to gravity. Both games somehow vary in\ntheir gameplay, but the goal is always to move the coloured blocks in order to\nreach a specific configuration and make them interact with each other or with\nother elements of the game. In Jelly-No the goal is to merge all coloured\nblocks of a same colour, which also happens when they make contact. In Hanano\nthe goal is to make all the coloured blocks bloom by making contact with\nflowers of the same colour. Jelly-No was proven by Chao Yang to be NP-Complete\nunder the restriction that all movable blocks are the same colour and NP-Hard\nfor more colours. Hanano was proven by Michael C. Chavrimootoo to be\nPSPACE-Complete under the restriction that all movable blocks are the same\ncolour. However, the question whether Jelly-No for more than one colours is\nalso PSPACE-complete or if it too stays in NP was left open. In this paper, we\nsettle this question, proving that Jelly-No is PSPACE-Complete with an\nunbounded number of colours. We further show that, if we allow black jellies\n(that is, jellies that do not need to be merged), the game is PSPACE-complete\neven for one colour.

Experiments on two real-world datasets show MoGERNN\nconsistently outperforms baseline methods for both observed and unobserved\nlocations. MoGERNN can accurately predict congestion evolution even in areas\nwithout sensors, offering valuable information for traffic management.\nMoreover, MoGERNN is adaptable to dynamic sensing networks, maintaining\ncompetitive performance even compared to its retrained counterpart.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms disproportionately\nimpacts vulnerable populations, eroding trust, exacerbating inequality, and\namplifying harmful narratives. Detecting fake news in multimodal contexts --\nwhere deceptive content combines text and images -- is particularly challenging\ndue to the nuanced interplay between modalities. Existing multimodal fake news\ndetection methods often emphasize cross-modal consistency but ignore the\ncomplex interactions between text and visual elements, which may complement,\ncontradict, or independently influence the predicted veracity of a post. To\naddress these challenges, we present Modality Interactive Mixture-of-Experts\nfor Fake News Detection (MIMoE-FND), a novel hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts\nframework designed to enhance multimodal fake news detection by explicitly\nmodeling modality interactions through an interaction gating mechanism. Our\napproach models modality interactions by evaluating two key aspects of modality\ninteractions: unimodal prediction agreement and semantic alignment. The\nhierarchical structure of MIMoE-FND allows for distinct learning pathways\ntailored to different fusion scenarios, adapting to the unique characteristics\nof each modality interaction. By tailoring fusion strategies to diverse\nmodality interaction scenarios, MIMoE-FND provides a more robust and nuanced\napproach to multimodal fake news detection. We evaluate our approach on three\nreal-world benchmarks spanning two languages, demonstrating its superior\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods. By enhancing the accuracy and\ninterpretability of fake news detection, MIMoE-FND offers a promising tool to\nmitigate the spread of misinformation, with the potential to better safeguard\nvulnerable communities against its harmful effects.",

    "abstract": "Substance use disorders (SUDs) are a serious public health concern in the\nUnited States. Alcohol and cannabis are two of the most widely used substances.\nFor adolescent/youth users of alcohol or cannabis, we propose a joint Bayesian\nlearning model to predict their risks of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD)\nand cannabis use disorder (CUD) in adulthood based on their personal risk\nfactors. The model is trained on nationally representative longitudinal data\nfrom Add Health (n = 12503). It consists of sub-models that predict the two\nSUDs for three groups of users-those who use alcohol only, cannabis only, and\nboth substances - based on shared as well as unique risk factors. The model\ncomprises of ten predictors. We externally validate the model on two\nindependent datasets. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic\ncurves for AUD and CUD, respectively, are: (a) 0.719 and 0.690 based on 5-fold\ncross-validation, (b) 0.748 and 0.710 based on validation dataset 1, and (c)\n0.650 and 0.750 based on validation dataset 2. A simulation study shows that\nthe proposed joint modeling approach generally performs better than separate\nunivariate modeling of the corresponding dependent outcomes in terms of\npredictive accuracy.

Energy level quantum properties and transition wavenumbers\nof these elements underpins almost all spectroscopic plasma diagnostic\ninvestigations, with prominent demands from astronomy and fusion research.\nDespite their importance, these fundamental data are incomplete for many\nspecies. A major limitation for the analyses of emission spectra of the open d-\nand f-shell elements is the amount of time and human resource required to\nextract transition wavenumbers and intensities from the spectra. Here, the\nspectral line detection problem is approached by encoding the spectrum\npoint-wise using bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks, where\ntransition wavenumber positions are decoded by a fully connected neural\nnetwork. The model was trained using simulated atomic spectra and evaluated\nagainst experimental Fourier transform spectra of Ni ($Z=28$) covering\n1800-70,000 cm$^{-1}$ (5555-143 nm) and Nd ($Z=60$) covering 25,369-32,485\ncm$^{-1}$ (394-308 nm), measured under a variety of experimental set-ups.\nImprovements over conventional methods in line detection were evident,\nparticularly for spectral lines that are noisy, blended, and/or distorted by\ninstrumental spectral resolution-limited ringing.

Different\nspacecraft configurations (inertial parameter sets) are simulated under\ndifferent actuation profiles, in order to produce an optimised time-series\nclustering classifier that can be used to distinguish between them. The\nactuation is comprised of finite sequences of constant inputs that are applied\nin order, based on typical actuators available. By learning from the system's\nresponses across multiple input sequences, and then applying measures of\ntime-series similarity and F1-score, an optimal actuation sequence can be\nchosen either for one specific system configuration or for the overall set of\npossible configurations. This allows for both estimation of the inertial\nparameter set without any prior knowledge of state, as well as validation of\ntransitions between different configurations after a deployment event. The\noptimisation of the actuation sequence is handled by a reinforcement learning\nmodel that uses the proximal policy optimisation (PPO) algorithm, by repeatedly\ntrying different sequences and evaluating the impact on classifier performance\naccording to a multi-objective metric.",

    "abstract": "One of the primary objectives of this paper is to establish a generalized\nCauchy-Kovalevskaya extension for axially harmonic functions. We demonstrate\nthat the result can be expressed as a power series involving Bessel-type\nfunctions of specific differential operators acting on two initial functions.\nAdditionally, we analyze the decomposition of the harmonic CK extension in\nterms of integrals over the sphere $ \\mathbb{S}^{m-1} $ involving functions of\nplane wave type.\n  Another key goal of this paper is to explore the relationship between the\nharmonic Cauchy-Kovalevskaya extension and the Fueter-Sce theorem. The\nFueter-Sce theorem outlines a two-step process for constructing axially\nmonogenic functions in $ \\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ starting from holomorphic functions\nin one complex variable. The first step generates the class of slice monogenic\nfunctions, while the second step produces axially monogenic functions by\napplying the pointwise differential operator $\n\\Delta_{\\mathbb{R}{^{m+1}}}^{\\frac{m-1}{2}} $ with $m$ being odd, known as the\nFueter-Sce map, to a slice monogenic function.\n  By suitably factorizing the Fueter-Sce map, we introduce the set of axially\nharmonic functions, which serves as an intermediate class between slice\nmonogenic and axially monogenic functions. In this paper, we establish a\nconnection between the harmonic CK extension and the factorization of the\nFueter-Sce map. This connection leads to a new notion of harmonic polynomials,\nwhich we show to form a basis for the Riesz potential. Finally, we also\nconstruct a basis for the space of axially harmonic functions.",

Given a classical optimization problem $\\Pi$ (e.g., spanning tree,\nminimum cuts, maximum matching, minimum vertex cover) with input size $n$ and\nan integer $k\\geq 1$, the goal is to generate a collection of $k$ maximally\ndiverse solutions to $\\Pi$. This diverse-X paradigm not only allows the user to\ngenerate very different solutions, but also helps make systems more secure and\nrobust by handling uncertainty, and achieve energy efficiency.\n  For problems $\\Pi$ in P (such as spanning tree and minimum cut), there are\nefficient $\\text{poly}(n,k)$ approximation algorithms available for the diverse\nvariants [Hanaka et al.

This study\nfocuses on addressing a critical challenge in renewable energy decision-making\nby developing a novel framework for optimal solar panel selection, a key\ncomponent of sustainable energy solutions. Solar panel selection involves\nevaluating multiple interdependent criteria, such as efficiency, cost,\ndurability, and environmental impact. Traditional multi-criteria\ndecision-making (MCDM) methods often fail to account for the interdependencies\namong these criteria, leading to suboptimal outcomes. To overcome this\nlimitation, the study introduces the Choquet Aggregated Sum Product Assessment\n(CASPAS) method, a Choquet integral-based MCDM approach that incorporates fuzzy\nmeasures to model interactions among criteria. CASPAS generalizes the Weighted\nAggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method, thereby enhancing\ndecision-making accuracy and reliability. This study also introduces the\nconcept of disc intuitionistic fuzzy set (D-IFS), a generalization of the\nconcept of circular intuitionistic fuzzy set, which employ a radius function\ncapable of assigning varying values to individual elements instead of relying\non a fixed radius. Recognizing that traditional weighted aggregation operators\nneglect the interaction among criteria, this study proposes disc intuitionistic\nfuzzy Choquet integral operators by incorporating the concept of fuzzy\nmeasures, which are effective in modeling such interactions.

However, under the\nmicrogravity conditions of the Plasma Kristall-4 (PK-4) experiment on the\nInternational Space Station (ISS), the particles fill the plasma, allowing us\nto investigate the properties of a three-dimensional (3D) multi-particle\nsystem. This paper examines the change in the spatial ordering and thermal\nstate of the particle system created when dust particles are stopped by\nperiodic oscillations of the electric field, known as polarity switching, in a\ndc glow discharge plasma.\n  Data from the ISS is compared against experiments performed using a\nground-based reference version of PK-4 and numerical simulations. Initial\nresults show substantive differences in the velocity distribution functions\nbetween experiments on the ground and in microgravity. There are also\ndifferences in the motion of the dust cloud, in microgravity there is an\nexpansion of the dust cloud at the application of polarity switching which is\nnot seen in the ground-based experiments. It is proposed that the dust cloud in\nmicrogravity gains thermal energy at the application of polarity switching due\nto this expansion. Simulation results suggest that this may be due to a\nmodification in the effective screening length of the dust at the onset of\npolarity switching, which arises from a configuration energy between the\ncharged particles. Experimental measurements and simulations show that an\nextended time (much greater than the Epstein drag decay) is required to\ndissipate this energy.",

To address these limitations and enhance domain\nadaptability, this work first introduces GoPro Random Sharp (GoProRS), a new\ndataset where the the frequency of sharp frames within the sequence is\ncustomizable, allowing more diverse training and testing scenarios.\nFurthermore, it presents a novel video deblurring model, called SPEINet, that\nintegrates sharp frame features into blurry frame reconstruction through an\nattention-based encoder-decoder architecture, a lightweight yet robust sharp\nframe detection and an edge extraction phase. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that SPEINet outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple\ndatasets, achieving an average of +3.2% PSNR improvement over recent\ntechniques.

So in this work, we\ninvestigated induce GWs in the T-model inflation with Gauss-Bonnet coupling.\nConsider the scenario of traversing a domain wall in moduli space, we take the\ncoupling coefficient to be an approximately step function. Within suitable\nparameter regions, the model exhibits de Sitter fixed points, which allows\ninflation to undergo an ultra-slow-roll phase, which causes the power spectrum\nto exhibit a peak. Such a peak can induce nanohertz GWs, which provids an\nexplanation for the PTA observational data. Furthermore, we consider the case\nof multiple domain wall crossings, and adopting a double-step coupling\nfunction. In this case, the resulting GW spectrum has two peaks with\nfrequencies around \\(10^{-8} \\,\\text{Hz}\\) and \\(10^{-2}\\,\\text{Hz}\\),\nrespectively. Which can be observed by the PTA and the space GW detectors\nsimultaneously.Additionally, the reentry of the power spectrum peaks into the\nhorizon leads to the collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs).

With its eccentric 5.5-year-long orbit, the periastron passage,\nduring which the stars are separated by only $1-2$\\,au, is an intriguing time\ninterval to probe particle acceleration processes within the system. In this\nwork, we report on an extensive VHE observation campaign that for the first\ntime covers the full periastron passage carried out with the High Energy\nStereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) in its 5-telescope configuration with upgraded\ncameras. VHE gamma-ray emission from $\\eta$ Carinae was detected during the\nperiastron passage with a steep spectrum with spectral index $\\Gamma= 3.3 \\pm\n0.2_{\\mathrm{stat}} \\, \\pm 0.1_{\\mathrm{syst}}$. Together with previous and\nfollow-up observations, we derive a long-term light curve sampling one full\norbit, showing hints of an increase of the VHE flux towards periastron, but no\nhint of variability during the passage itself. An analysis of contemporaneous\nFermi-LAT data shows that the VHE spectrum represents a smooth continuation of\nthe HE spectrum. From modelling the combined spectrum we conclude that the\ngamma-ray emission region is located at distances of ${\\sim}10 - 20$\\,au from\nthe centre of mass of the system and that protons are accelerated up to\nenergies of at least several TeV inside the system in this phase.",

These issues hinder the\nperformance of computer vision tasks such as object detection, facial\nrecognition, and autonomous driving.Traditional enhancement techniques, such as\nmulti-scale fusion and histogram equalization, fail to preserve fine details\nand often struggle with maintaining the natural appearance of enhanced images\nunder complex lighting conditions. Although the Retinex theory provides a\nfoundation for image decomposition, it often amplifies noise, leading to\nsuboptimal image quality.

Our model\nintroduces a learnable wavelet transform module in the illumination estimation\nphase, preserving high- and low-frequency components to enhance edge and\ntexture details. Additionally, we design a dual-branch structure that leverages\nthe power of the Transformer architecture to enhance both the illumination and\nstructural components of the image.Through extensive experiments, our model\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.Code is available\nhere: https://github.com/LaLaLoXX/DLEN",

All metallic\nparts are described in the framework of the quasiclassical Usadel Green's\nfunction theory applicable to diffusive systems. The interfaces are\ncharacterized by an S-matrix obtained for a model potential with exchange\nvectors pointing in an arbitrary direction with respect to the magnetization in\nthe sFM. Our theory predicts a large charge Josephson diode effect with an\nefficiency exceeding $33\\%$ and a perfect spin diode effect with $100\\%$\nefficiency. To achieve these the following conditions are necessary: (i) a\nnoncoplanar profile of the three magnetization vectors in the system and (ii)\ndifferent densities of states of spin-$\\uparrow$ and spin-$\\downarrow$ bands in\nthe sFM achieved by a strong spin polarization. The former gives rise to the\nquantum-geometric phase, $\\Delta\\varphi$, that enters the theory in a very\nsimilar manner as the superconducting phase difference across the junction,\n$\\Delta\\chi$.

Our follow-up CO(2-1) observations have revealed even\nmore complex gas kinematics, where the southern radio jet is driving out\nmolecular gas in the form of a swiftly expanding bubble, with velocities up to\nalmost 400 km s$^{-1}$. We found highly elevated CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) line ratios\nfor the gas belonging to the bubble and also further away from the radio jets.\nPrevious observations have shown that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the\nhost galaxy, NGC 1167, is in a very low-accretion state. Thus, we attribute the\nhigh line ratios to the high gas excitation caused by the jet--ISM interaction.\nThe radio jets, despite exhibiting a relatively low luminosity ($1.3 \\times\n10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$), are solely responsible for the observed extreme gas\nkinematics. This is one of the clearest detections of an expanding cold gas\nbubble in such a type of source, showing that the jets are affecting both the\nkinematics and physicals conditions of the gas. Our study adds to the growing\nstore of evidence that low-luminosity radio sources can also affect the\nkinematics and physical conditions of the cold gas, which fuels star formation,\nin their host galaxies to a significant extent. Hence, such sources should be\nconsidered in models seeking to quantify feedback from radio AGN.",

Finally, it dynamically constructs a unique prompt probability\ndistribution for each test instance, based on its proximity to cluster centers,\nfrom which prompts are selected for reasoning. CDW-CoT consistently outperforms\ntraditional CoT methods across six datasets, including commonsense, symbolic,\nand mathematical reasoning tasks.

Our framework can\ndisentangle complex visual elements and attributes from as little as a single\nimage, while enabling seamless plug-and-play generation of combinations of\nconcepts extracted from multiple images. As opposed to existing works,\nTokenVerse can handle multiple images with multiple concepts each, and supports\na wide-range of concepts, including objects, accessories, materials, pose, and\nlighting. Our work exploits a DiT-based text-to-image model, in which the input\ntext affects the generation through both attention and modulation (shift and\nscale). We observe that the modulation space is semantic and enables localized\ncontrol over complex concepts. Building on this insight, we devise an\noptimization-based framework that takes as input an image and a text\ndescription, and finds for each word a distinct direction in the modulation\nspace. These directions can then be used to generate new images that combine\nthe learned concepts in a desired configuration. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of TokenVerse in challenging personalization settings, and\nshowcase its advantages over existing methods. project's webpage in\nhttps://token-verse.github.io/",

In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into the\nconvergence and the associated rate of time-delayed opinion dynamics with\ndiverse interaction types in both discrete-time and continuous-time systems.\nFor the discrete-time system, we commence by establishing sufficient conditions\nfor its convergence on arbitrary signed interaction networks.

Regarding the continuous-time system, we derive the feasible domain of\nthe delay that ensures the convergence of opinion dynamics, revealing that,\nunlike the discrete-time scenarios, large time delays can instigate the\ndivergence of opinions.

While many vision tasks benefit from pre-trained\nfeature backbones to improve generalizability, point tracking has primarily\nrelied on simpler backbones trained from scratch on synthetic data, which may\nlimit robustness in real-world scenarios. Additionally, point tracking requires\ntemporal awareness to ensure coherence across frames, but using\ntemporally-aware features is still underexplored. Most current methods often\nemploy a two-stage process: an initial coarse prediction followed by a\nrefinement stage to inject temporal information and correct errors from the\ncoarse stage. These approach, however, is computationally expensive and\npotentially redundant if the feature backbone itself captures sufficient\ntemporal information.\n  In this work, we introduce Chrono, a feature backbone specifically designed\nfor point tracking with built-in temporal awareness. Leveraging pre-trained\nrepresentations from self-supervised learner DINOv2 and enhanced with a\ntemporal adapter, Chrono effectively captures long-term temporal context,\nenabling precise prediction even without the refinement stage. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that Chrono achieves state-of-the-art performance in a\nrefiner-free setting on the TAP-Vid-DAVIS and TAP-Vid-Kinetics datasets, among\ncommon feature backbones used in point tracking as well as DINOv2, with\nexceptional efficiency.

While models\nsuch as LSTM, GRU, Transformers, and State-Space Models (SSMs) have become\nstandard tools in this domain, selecting the optimal architecture remains a\nchallenge. Performance comparisons often depend on evaluation metrics and the\ndatasets under analysis, making the choice of a universally optimal model\ncontroversial. In this work, we introduce a flexible automated framework for\ntime series forecasting that systematically designs and evaluates diverse\nnetwork architectures by integrating LSTM, GRU, multi-head Attention, and SSM\nblocks. Using a multi-objective optimization approach, our framework determines\nthe number, sequence, and combination of blocks to align with specific\nrequirements and evaluation objectives. From the resulting Pareto-optimal\narchitectures, the best model for a given context is selected via a\nuser-defined preference function. We validate our framework across four\ndistinct real-world applications. Results show that a single-layer GRU or LSTM\nis usually optimal when minimizing training time alone. However, when\nmaximizing accuracy or balancing multiple objectives, the best architectures\nare often composite designs incorporating multiple block types in specific\nconfigurations. By employing a weighted preference function, users can resolve\ntrade-offs between objectives, revealing novel, context-specific optimal\narchitectures. Our findings underscore that no single neural architecture is\nuniversally optimal for time series forecasting.

We show that this bound implies weak\nconvergence under modest additional assumptions and leads to a bound on the\nerror of the variance of the iterate averages of the algorithm. Furthermore, we\nuse our main result to construct error bounds in terms of two common metrics:\nthe L\\'{e}vy-Prokhorov and bounded Wasserstein distances. Our results provide a\nfoundation for developing similar error bounds for the multivariate setting and\nfor more sophisticated stochastic approximation algorithms.",

Workloads in cloud environments often follow a Pareto\ndistribution, where a small percentage of tasks consume most resources, leading\nto bottlenecks and energy inefficiencies. By analyzing both traditional\nworkloads reflective of typical IoT and smart device usage and agentic\nworkloads, such as those generated by AI agents, robotics, and autonomous\nsystems, this study quantifies the energy and cost savings enabled by HEC. Our\nfindings reveal that HEC achieves energy savings of up to 75% and cost\nreductions exceeding 80%, even in resource-intensive agentic scenarios.

While numerous\ndefense strategies--such as prompt detection, modification, and model\nfine-tuning--have been proposed to counter these attacks, a critical question\narises: do these defenses compromise the utility and usability of LLMs for\nlegitimate users? Existing research predominantly focuses on the effectiveness\nof defense strategies without thoroughly examining their impact on performance,\nleaving a gap in understanding the trade-offs between LLM safety and\nperformance. Our research addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive\nstudy on the utility degradation, safety elevation, and exaggerated-safety\nescalation of LLMs with jailbreak defense strategies. We propose USEBench, a\nnovel benchmark designed to evaluate these aspects, along with USEIndex, a\ncomprehensive metric for assessing overall model performance. Through\nexperiments on seven state-of-the-art LLMs, we found that mainstream jailbreak\ndefenses fail to ensure both safety and performance simultaneously.

Traditional community discovery algorithms only focus on the\nestablishment and disconnection of connections between nodes, failing to\ncapture deeper factors. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose a\ncommunity discovery algorithm based on spatiotemporal graph embedding\n(CDA-SGE), which integrates spatial information and evolutions of nodes to\ncomprehensively capture the dynamic features of networks. Specifically, this\nalgorithm employs Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) to aggregate latent\nspatial information, effectively representing the embedding of nodes in space.\nTemporal evolutions of the nodes are then modeled using Gated Recurrent Units\n(GRU), thereby solving problems such as node dynamism and relationship\ntransmission. Finally, a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is applied to cluster\ndynamic network representations and identify community affiliations of nodes.\nWe then perform simulations on four types of dynamic networks and show that the\nCDA-SGE outperforms traditional community discovery algorithms in terms of\npurity, standardized mutual information, heterogeneity, and homogeneity.

    "abstract": "Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in understanding and describing visual content, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance across various vision-language tasks. However,\nthese models often generate descriptions containing objects or details that are\nabsent in the input image, a phenomenon commonly known as hallucination. Our\nwork investigates the key reasons behind this issue by analyzing the pattern of\nself-attention in transformer layers. We find that hallucinations often arise\nfrom the progressive weakening of attention weight to visual tokens in the\ndeeper layers of the LLM. Some previous works naively boost the attention of\nall visual tokens to mitigate this issue, resulting in suboptimal hallucination\nreduction. To address this, we identify two critical sets of visual tokens that\nfacilitate the transfer of visual information from the vision encoder to the\nLLM. Local tokens encode grounded information about objects present in an\nimage, while summary tokens capture the overall aggregated representation of\nthe image. Importantly, these two sets of tokens require different levels of\nweight enhancement. To this end, we propose \\textbf{PAINT} (\\textbf{P}aying\n\\textbf{A}ttention to \\textbf{IN}formed \\textbf{T}okens), a plug-and-play\nframework that intervenes in the self-attention mechanism of the LLM,\nselectively boosting the attention weights of local and summary tokens with\nexperimentally learned margins.

By\nleveraging insights from the Ising model and incorporating considerations of\ntopological defects, the transition to the glassy state in rod-like molecular\nsystems in the supercooled state is examined. Through a critical-like analysis\nof the system's dynamical properties, universality classes directly linked to\nsymmetry are discerned. This paper delves into the role of symmetry in the\nglass transition, as manifested in the generalized critical relation of\nconfigurational entropy $S_C(T)=S_0(1-T_K/T)^n$, where the critical exponent\n$n$ is intricately tied to the system's symmetry. The determined values of the\npseudocritical exponent $n$ exhibit universality across the studied systems and\ndemonstrate excellent agreement with thermodynamic data. Furthermore, the\ncongruence between the dynamic representation, as indicated by the primary\nrelaxation time, and the thermodynamic representation, exemplified by the\nspecific heat capacity, underscores the robustness of the findings. The\nidentification of critical-like behavior and the observation of symmetry\nbreaking during the transition to the glass state suggest its intrinsic\nthermodynamic nature.

However, they exhibit the opposite\nbehavior in other settings, which poses the problem of finding alternatives to\nensure convergence. In contrast, innovative dynamics, such as the Brown-von\nNeumann-Nash (BNN) or Smith, result in periodic trajectories with the potential\nto approximate Nash equilibria. Yet, no MARL algorithms based on these dynamics\nhave been proposed. In response to this challenge, we develop a novel\nexperience replay-based MARL algorithm that incorporates revision protocols as\ntunable hyperparameters. We demonstrate, by appropriately adjusting the\nrevision protocols, that the behavior of our algorithm mirrors the trajectories\nresulting from these dynamics. Importantly, our contribution provides a\nframework capable of extending the theoretical guarantees of MARL algorithms\nbeyond replicator dynamics. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings\nwith empirical results.",

This type of agents is characterized by the fact that\ntheir opinions follow a trajectory that does not respond to the dynamics of the\nmodel, although it does influence the rest of the normal agents. Simulation has\nbeen implemented to study how one manipulative group modifies the natural\ndynamics of some opinion models of bounded confidence. It is studied what\nstrategies based on the number of manipulative agents and their common opinion\ntrajectory can be carried out by a manipulative group to influence normal\nagents and attract them to their opinions.

To alleviate these issues,\nwe propose high error margin (HEM) loss, a variant of multi-class margin loss\nthat overcomes the training issues of other margin-based losses. We evaluate\nHEM extensively on a range of architectures and datasets. We find that HEM loss\nis more effective than cross-entropy loss across a wide range of tasks: unknown\nclass rejection, adversarial robustness, learning with imbalanced data,\ncontinual learning, and semantic segmentation (a pixel-level classification\ntask). Despite all training hyper-parameters being chosen for CE loss, HEM is\ninferior to CE only in terms of clean accuracy and this difference is\ninsignificant. We also compare HEM to specialised losses that have previously\nbeen proposed to improve performance on specific tasks. LogitNorm, a loss\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on unknown class rejection, produces\nsimilar performance to HEM for this task, but is much poorer for continual\nlearning and semantic segmentation. Logit-adjusted loss, designed for\nimbalanced data, has superior results to HEM for that task, but performs more\npoorly on unknown class rejection and semantic segmentation.

Most quantum networks\nrely on symmetries to achieve an efficient state transfer. A straightforward\nway to design such networks is to use spatial symmetries, which severely limits\nthe design space. Our work takes a novel approach to designing photonic\nnetworks that do not exhibit any conventional spatial symmetries, yet\nnevertheless support an efficient transfer of quantum states. Paradoxically,\nwhile a perfect transfer efficiency is technically unattainable in these\nnetworks, a fidelity arbitrarily close to unity is always reached within a\nfinite time of evolution. Key to this approach are so-called latent, or\n'hidden', symmetries, which are embodied in the spectral properties of the\nnetwork. Latent symmetries substantially expand the design space of quantum\nnetworks and hold significant potential for applications in quantum\ncryptography and secure state transfer. We experimentally realize such a\nnine-site latent-symmetric network and successfully observe state transfer\nbetween two sites with a measured fidelity of 75%. Furthermore, by launching a\ntwo-photon state, we show that quantum interference is preserved by the\nnetwork.

    "abstract": "Lepton flavor violation (LFV) offers a powerful probe of physics beyond the\nStandard Model, particularly in models addressing neutrino masses and the\nbaryon asymmetry of the universe. In this study, we investigate LFV processes\nwithin the framework of type II seesaw leptogenesis, where the Standard Model\nis extended by an $SU(2)_L$ triplet Higgs field. We focus on key LFV processes\nincluding $\\mu^+\\to e^+\\gamma$, $\\mu^+ \\to e^+e^-e^+$, and $\\mu \\rightarrow e$\nconversion in nuclei, deriving stringent constraints on the parameter space\nfrom current experimental data. We scan the 3$\\sigma$ range of neutrino\noscillation parameters and identify the most conservative bounds consistent\nwith existing measurements. Our results reveal that the MEG experiment\ncurrently provides the strongest constraints in the normal ordering (NO)\nscenario, while the SINDRUM experiment offers comparable sensitivity in the\ninverted ordering (IO) case. Future experiments, such as MEG II, Mu3e, Mu2e,\nand COMET, are predicted to significantly improve the sensitivity, testing\nlarger regions of the parameter space. This work underscores the crucial role\nof LFV experiments in probing type II seesaw leptogenesis, providing an avenue\nto explore the connections between neutrino mass generation, baryogenesis, and\ninflation at experimentally accessible energy scales.",

Uncertainties on the results have been\nconsidered in the literature, but mostly those originating from the learning\nand processing methods. Uncertainty on the data is hardly challenged, as a\nsingle sample is often considered representative enough of each subject\nincluded in the analysis. In this paper, we propose a representation learning\nstrategy to estimate local uncertainties on a physiological descriptor (here,\nmyocardial deformation) previously obtained from medical images by different\ndefinitions or computations. We first use manifold alignment to match the\nlatent representations associated to different high-dimensional input\ndescriptors. Then, we formulate plausible distributions of latent\nuncertainties, and finally exploit them to reconstruct uncertainties on the\ninput high-dimensional descriptors. We demonstrate its relevance for the\nquantification of myocardial deformation (strain) from 3D echocardiographic\nimage sequences of the right ventricle, for which a lack of consensus exists in\nits definition and which directional component to use. We used a database of\n100 control subjects with right ventricle overload, for which different types\nof strain are available at each point of the right ventricle endocardial\nsurface mesh. Our approach quantifies local uncertainties on myocardial\ndeformation from different descriptors defining this physiological concept.\nSuch uncertainties cannot be directly estimated by local statistics on such\ndescriptors, potentially of heterogeneous types.

    "abstract": "Empowered by semantic-rich content information, multimedia recommendation has\nemerged as a potent personalized technique. Current endeavors center around\nharnessing multimedia content to refine item representation or uncovering\nlatent item-item structures based on modality similarity. Despite the\neffectiveness, we posit that these methods are usually suboptimal due to the\nintroduction of irrelevant multimedia features into recommendation tasks. This\nstems from the fact that generic multimedia feature extractors, while\nwell-designed for domain-specific tasks, can inadvertently introduce\ntask-irrelevant features, leading to potential misguidance of recommenders. In\nthis work, we propose a denoised multimedia recommendation paradigm via the\nInformation Bottleneck principle (IB). Specifically, we propose a novel\nInformation Bottleneck denoised Multimedia Recommendation (IBMRec) model to\ntackle the irrelevant feature issue. IBMRec removes task-irrelevant features\nfrom both feature and item-item structure perspectives, which are implemented\nby two-level IB learning modules: feature-level (FIB) and graph-level (GIB). In\nparticular, FIB focuses on learning the minimal yet sufficient multimedia\nfeatures. This is achieved by maximizing the mutual information between\nmultimedia representation and recommendation tasks, while concurrently\nminimizing it between multimedia representation and pre-trained multimedia\nfeatures. Furthermore, GIB is designed to learn the robust item-item graph\nstructure, it refines the item-item graph based on preference affinity, then\nminimizes the mutual information between the original graph and the refined\none.

This paper introduces a novel SVGS-DSGAT\nmodel that combines GraphSage, SVAM, and DSGAT modules, enhancing feature\nextraction and target detection capabilities through graph neural networks and\nattention mechanisms. The model integrates IoT technology to facilitate\nreal-time data collection and processing, optimizing resource allocation and\nmodel responsiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that the SVGS-DSGAT\nmodel achieves an mAP of 40.8% on the URPC 2020 dataset and 41.5% on the\nSeaDronesSee dataset, significantly outperforming existing mainstream models.\nThis IoT-enhanced approach not only excels in high-noise and complex\nbackgrounds but also improves the overall efficiency and scalability of the\nsystem. This research provides an effective IoT solution for underwater target\ndetection technology, offering significant practical application value and\nbroad development prospects.",

The formation of such jets,\nwhether they are launched by magnetic field lines anchored to the accretion\ndisc or directly connected to the black hole's (BH) ergosphere, is the subject\nof ongoing, extensive research. 3C84, the compact radio source in the central\ngalaxy NGC1275 of the Perseus super-cluster, is a prime laboratory for testing\nsuch jet launching scenarios, as well as studying the innermost, sub-parsec AGN\nstructure and jet origin. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) offers a\nunique view into the physical processes in action, in the immediate vicinity of\nBHs, unparalleled by other observational techniques. With VLBI at short\nwavelengths particular high angular resolutions are obtained. Utilising such cm\nand mm-VLBI observations of 3C84 with the European VLBI Network and the Event\nHorizon Telescope, we study the magnetic field strength and associated\naccretion flow around its central SMBH. This is possible, as higher frequency\nVLBI measurements are capable of peering through the accretion flow surrounding\nthe central engine of 3C84, which is known to block the line of sight to the\nsub-parsec counter-jet via free-free absorption. Furthermore, we study the\nmagnetic field's signature in the core region, as manifested in polarised\nlight. As part of this analysis we compare our observations to relativistic\nmagneto-hydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we investigate the effect of\ninstabilities on the shape of the jet's parsec-scale funnel and try to connect\nthem to its historical evolution.",

Traditional window-based methods for log\nanomaly detection often suffer from context bias and fuzzy localization, which\nhinder their ability to precisely and efficiently identify anomalies. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a graph-centric framework, TempoLog, which\nleverages multi-scale temporal graph networks for discrete log anomaly\ndetection. Unlike conventional methods, TempoLog constructs continuous-time\ndynamic graphs directly from event logs, eliminating the need for fixed-size\nwindow grouping. By representing log templates as nodes and their temporal\nrelationships as edges, the framework dynamically captures both local and\nglobal dependencies across multiple temporal scales. Additionally, a\nsemantic-aware model enhances detection by incorporating rich contextual\ninformation.

However, extending this approach to\nnon-Hermitian quantum systems presents several important challenges, primarily\ndue to ambiguities in defining the Berry phase and the non-unitary evolution of\nthe wave-packets when $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$ symmetry is broken. In this\nwork, we adopt the complex Berry phase definition using the bi-orthogonal\nformalism and derive the semiclassical equations of motion (EOM) for a\nwave-packet in a non-Hermitian topological system. Interestingly, we find that\nthe complex Berry curvature introduces both an anomalous velocity and an\nanomalous force into the semiclassical EOM. To validate the derived EOM, we\ndesign a non-Hermitian Haldane model featuring non-reciprocal\nnext-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping, where the imbalance in the NNN hopping\namplitudes gives rise to an emergent `complex chirality'. We reveal that the\nreal and imaginary components of the complex chirality dictate the signs of\nboth the real and imaginary parts of the complex Berry curvature, as well as\nthe direction and dissipation rate of the edge states. Our analytical findings\nare confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the wave-packet dynamics.\nFinally, we suggest a potential experimental realization of this complex\nHaldane model using a non-Hermitian optical chiral cavity, providing a\npromising platform for testing our theoretical predictions.",

These artifacts degrade image\nquality and limit clinical adoption. Traditional RF shimming methods, including\nMagnitude Least Squares (MLS) optimization, mitigate RF field inhomogeneity but\nare time-intensive and often require the presence of the patient.

This paper introduces a holistic\nlearning-based framework called Fast RF Shimming, which achieves a 5000-fold\nspeedup compared to MLS methods. First, random-initialized Adaptive Moment\nEstimation (Adam) derives reference shimming weights from multichannel RF\nfields. Next, a Residual Network (ResNet) maps RF fields to shimming outputs\nwhile incorporating a confidence parameter into the loss function. Finally, a\nNon-uniformity Field Detector (NFD) identifies extreme non-uniform outcomes.\nComparative evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in both speed and\npredictive accuracy.

Influence-based methods show promise in achieving (1) by estimating the\ncontribution of each training example to the model's predictions, but often\nstruggle with (2). Our systematic investigation reveals that this\nunderperformance can be attributed to an inherent bias where certain tasks\nintrinsically have greater influence than others. As a result, data selection\nis often biased towards these tasks, not only hurting the model's performance\non others but also, counterintuitively, harms performance on these\nhigh-influence tasks themselves.\n  As a remedy, we propose BIDS, a Balanced and Influential Data Selection\nalgorithm.

Experiments with both\nLlama-3 and Mistral-v0.3 on seven benchmarks spanning five diverse capabilities\nshow that BIDS consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art influence-based\nalgorithms and other non-influence-based selection frameworks.

To solve the problem, the percentile method is\noften used to clip outliers. However, clipping the outliers has another problem\nof removing the important and strong signals in the DNNs. This paper proposes\nSplitQuant to keep the outliers and improve the quantization resolution at the\nsame time. SplitQuant narrows down the range of the original values and\nmitigates the effect of outliers by splitting each quantizable layer into three\nmathematically equivalent layers and applies different scaling factors.\nEspecially, weights and biases are clustered into lower, middle and upper\nclusters for optimized split. By preprocessing DNNs with SplitQuant,\nquantization algorithms can achieve better results. SplitQuant was applied on\ntwo BERT-Tiny models and improved the accuracy of INT2 quantization by 3.3%p\nand 2.1%p, achieving accuracies comparable to those of the original FP32\nmodels.",

A key\naspect of this model is that the maximum stellar mass scales linearly with\ncloud mass, such that extremely massive stars (EMSs, $10^{3-4}\\,\\msun$) form in\nmassive GCs ($\\gtrsim10^5\\,\\msun$). The total wind mass loss is dominated by\naccreting EMSs (aEMSs), whose wind mass-loss rates have become comparable to\ntheir accretion rates ($\\gtrsim10^{-2}\\,\\msun\\,\\yr^{-1}$). These winds pollute\nthe intra-cluster medium with hot-hydrogen burning yields during GC formation.\nWe propose a parameterised model for the evolution of the stellar mass function\nduring GC formation ($\\sim 1-2\\,\\myr$), accounting for gas inflow, wind mass\nloss and mixing of aEMS yields with pristine gas that has initial proto-GC\nabundances. Low-mass stars ($\\lesssim1\\,\\msun$) form continuously from this\nmixed gas and their abundances resemble observed abundance trends with GC mass\nand metallicity, specifically: (i) the helium spread in a typical GC is small\n($\\Delta Y \\simeq 0.01$) and increases with GC mass; (ii) the fraction of\npolluted stars increases with GC mass and metallicity; (iii) the extent of the\nMg-Al anticorrelations is more pronounced in metal-poor and massive GCs. We\nconclude that GCs formed with a population of EMSs from gas with surface\ndensities $\\gtrsim10^3\\,\\msun\\,\\pc^{-2}$ and that nitrogen-rich galaxies\ndiscovered by the James Webb Space Telescope ({\\it JWST}) are dominated by\nEMS-rich GCs that formed in the earliest phases of galaxy formation.

    "abstract": "An M-sequence generated by a primitive polynomial has many interesting and\ndesirable properties. A pseudo-random array is the two-dimensional\ngeneralization of an M-sequence. There are non-primitive polynomials all of\nwhose non-zero sequences have the same period. These polynomials generate\n\\emph{sets} of sequences with properties similar to M-sequences. In this paper,\na two-dimensional generalization for such sequences is given. This\ngeneralization is for a pseudo-random array code, which is a set of $r_1 \\times\nr_2$ arrays in which each $n_1 \\times n_2$ nonzero matrix is contained exactly\nonce as a window in one of the arrays. Moreover, these arrays have the\nshift-and-add property, i.e., the bitwise addition of two arrays (or a\nnontrivial shift of such arrays) is another array (or a shift of another array)\nfrom the code. All the known arrays can be formed by folding sequences\ngenerated from an irreducible polynomial or a reducible polynomial whose\nfactors have the same degree and the same exponent. Two proof techniques are\nused to prove the constructions are indeed of pseudo-random array codes. The\nfirst technique is based on another method, different from folding, for\nconstructing some of these arrays. The second technique is a generalization of\na known proof technique. This generalization enables the construction of\npseudo-random arrays with parameters not known before, and also provides a\nvariety of pseudo-random array codes which cannot be generated by the first\nmethod. The two techniques also suggest two different hierarchies between\npseudo-random array codes. Finally, two methods to verify whether a folding of\nsequences, generated by these polynomials, yields a pseudo-random array or a\npseudo-random array code, will be presented.",

This paper presents\nFL-CLEANER, the first defense capable of filtering both byzantine and backdoor\nattackers' model updates in a non-IID FL environment. The originality of\nFL-CLEANER is twofold.

The nucleon emerges as a state of $N_c$\nvalence quarks bound by the pion mean field, which was created\nself-consistently by the $N_c$ valence quarks. In the large Euclidean time, the\nclassical nucleon mass is evaluated by minimizing the sum of the $N_c$\ndiscrete-level energies and the Dirac-continuum energy: $M_{\\text{cl}}=1.2680$\nGeV. The pion mean-field solution turns out broader than the local chiral\nquark-soliton model. The zero-mode quantization furnishes the nucleon with\nproper quantum numbers such as the spin and isospin.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) generally utilize a consistent data distribution\nthroughout the pretraining process. However, as the model's capability\nimproves, it is intuitive that its data preferences dynamically change,\nindicating the need for pretraining with different data at various training\nstages. To achieve it, we propose the Perplexity Difference (PD) based\nPreference Curriculum learning (PDPC) framework, which always perceives and\nuses the data preferred by LLMs to train and boost them. First, we introduce\nthe PD metric to quantify the difference in how challenging a sample is for\nweak versus strong models. Samples with high PD are more challenging for weak\nmodels to learn and are more suitable to be arranged in the later stage of\npretraining. Second, we propose the preference function to approximate and\npredict the data preference of the LLM at any training step, so as to complete\nthe arrangement of the dataset offline and ensure continuous training without\ninterruption. Experimental results on 1.3B and 3B models demonstrate that PDPC\nsignificantly surpasses baselines. Notably, the 3B model trained on 1T tokens\nachieves an increased average accuracy of over 8.1% across MMLU and CMMLU.",

This evaluation tests eleven different open source LLMs with\nsizes ranging from 1-70 billion model parameters on three basic tasks of the\ntumor documentation process: identifying tumor diagnoses, assigning ICD-10\ncodes, and extracting the date of first diagnosis. For evaluating the LLMs on\nthese tasks, a dataset of annotated text snippets based on anonymized doctors'\nnotes from urology was prepared. Different prompting strategies were used to\ninvestigate the effect of the number of examples in few-shot prompting and to\nexplore the capabilities of the LLMs in general. The models Llama 3.1 8B,\nMistral 7B, and Mistral NeMo 12 B performed comparably well in the tasks.\nModels with less extensive training data or having fewer than 7 billion\nparameters showed notably lower performance, while larger models did not\ndisplay performance gains. Examples from a different medical domain than\nurology could also improve the outcome in few-shot prompting, which\ndemonstrates the ability of LLMs to handle tasks needed for tumor\ndocumentation. Open source LLMs show a strong potential for automating tumor\ndocumentation. Models from 7-12 billion parameters could offer an optimal\nbalance between performance and resource efficiency. With tailored fine-tuning\nand well-designed prompting, these models might become important tools for\nclinical documentation in the future.

Recent studies have\ndemonstrated that the student-teacher (S-T) framework effectively addresses\nthis challenge. However, most S-T frameworks rely solely on pre-trained teacher\nnetworks to guide student networks in learning multi-scale similar features,\noverlooking the potential of the student networks to enhance learning through\nmulti-scale feature fusion. In this study, we propose a novel model named\nPFADSeg, which integrates a pre-trained teacher network, a denoising student\nnetwork with multi-scale feature fusion, and a guided anomaly segmentation\nnetwork into a unified framework. By adopting a unique teacher-encoder and\nstudent-decoder denoising mode, the model improves the student network's\nability to learn from teacher network features. Furthermore, an adaptive\nfeature fusion mechanism is introduced to train a self-supervised segmentation\nnetwork that synthesizes anomaly masks autonomously, significantly increasing\ndetection performance. Evaluated on the MVTec AD dataset, PFADSeg achieves\nstate-of-the-art results with an image-level AUC of 98.9%, a pixel-level mean\nprecision of 76.4%, and an instance-level mean precision of 78.7%.",

Our experimental observation in the trilayer system\nTa/FeCoB/TaOx is supported by ab initio calculations: they reveal that\nvariations in orbital filling and inter-atomic distances at the interface,\ndriven by the number of ferromagnetic atomic layers, lead to an inversion of\nDMI chirality.

    "abstract": "Static analysis is an essential component of many modern software development\ntools. Unfortunately, the ever-increasing complexity of static analyzers makes\ntheir coding error-prone. Even analysis tools based on rigorous mathematical\ntechniques, such as abstract interpretation, are not immune to bugs. Ensuring\nthe correctness and reliability of software analyzers is critical if they are\nto be inserted in production compilers and development environments. While\ncompiler validation has seen notable success, formal validation of static\nanalysis tools remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose a\nmethod for testing abstract interpretation-based static analyzers. Broadly, it\nconsists in checking, over a suite of benchmarks, that the properties inferred\nstatically are satisfied dynamically. The main advantage of our approach lies\nin its simplicity, which stems directly from framing it within the Ciao\nassertion-based validation framework, and its blended static/dynamic assertion\nchecking approach. We demonstrate that in this setting, the analysis can be\ntested with little effort by combining the following components already present\nin the framework: 1) the static analyzer, which outputs its results as the\noriginal program source with assertions interspersed; 2) the assertion run-time\nchecking mechanism, which instruments a program to ensure that no assertion is\nviolated at run time; 3) the random test case generator, which generates random\ntest cases satisfying the properties present in assertion preconditions; and 4)\nthe unit-test framework, which executes those test cases. We have applied our\napproach to the CiaoPP static analyzer, resulting in the identification of many\nbugs with reasonable overhead. Most of these bugs have been either fixed or\nconfirmed, helping us detect a range of errors not only related to analysis\nsoundness but also within other aspects of the framework.",

Given\nthe limitations of this approach in interference-limited scenarios, the\nshrinkage coefficient is iteratively optimized using the sample mean squared\nerror of the hard-decision symbols, which is more closely related to the actual\nsystem's performance, e.g., the symbol error rate (SER).

However, they suffer from the well-known problems of AI systems\nsuch as non-determinism, non-explainability, and anomalies. This naturally\nraises the question of their evaluation and, in particular, their comparison\nwith existing modular solutions.\n  This work extends a study of the critical configuration testing (CCTest)\napproach that has been applied to four open modular autopilots.

This enables an accurate\nassessment of the ability to drive safely in critical situations, as any\nincident observed in the simulation involves the failure of a tested autopilot.\nThe contribution of this paper is twofold.\n  Firstly, we apply the CCTest approach to four end-to-end open autopilots,\nInterFuser, MILE, Transfuser, and LMDrive, and compare their test results with\nthose of the four modular open autopilots previously tested with the same\napproach implemented in the Carla simulation environment. This comparison\nidentifies both differences and similarities in the failures of the two\nautopilot types in critical configurations.\n  Secondly, we compare the evaluations of the four autopilots carried out in\nthe Carla Leaderboard with the CCTest results.

This is\naccomplished via a bijective proof of the equidistribution of $(g\\exc_\\ell,\ng\\den_\\ell)$ and $ (r\\des, r\\maj)$ where $r=g+\\ell-1$.\n  Setting $g=\\ell=1$, our result recovers the equidistribution of $(\\des,\n\\maj)$ and $(\\exc, \\den)$, which was first conjectured by Denert and proved by\nFoata and Zeilberger. Our second main result is concerned with the analogous\nresult for $(g\\exc_\\ell, g\\den_{g+\\ell})$ which states that $(g\\exc_\\ell,\ng\\den_{g+\\ell})$ is $(g+\\ell-1)$-Euler-Mahonian for all positive integers $g$\nand $\\ell$.",

However, wide-angle video is prone to deformation, exposure and\nother distortions, resulting in poor video quality and affecting the perception\nand experience, which may seriously hinder its application in fields such as\ncompetitive sports. Up to now, few explorations focus on the quality assessment\nissue of wide-angle video. This deficiency primarily stems from the absence of\na specialized dataset for wide-angle videos. To bridge this gap, we construct\nthe first Multi-annotated and multi-modal Wide-angle Video quality assessment\n(MWV) dataset.

    "abstract": "Code pre-trained models have shown promising effectiveness in various\nsoftware engineering tasks. Among these tasks, many tasks are related to\nsoftware evolution and/or code editing. However, existing code pre-trained\nmodels often overlook the real-world code editing data and the evolutionary\nnature of the editing process. In this paper, to simulate the step-by-step code\nediting process of human developers, we propose DivoT5, a pre-trained model\nbased on directional diffusion at the data level. In DivoT5, we adopt two\ncategories of pre-training tasks. The first category is mask and denoising\ntasks augmented with a diffusion direction representing code evolution. That\nis, we first apply a noising process to the code snippets before evolution, and\nthen ask the pre-training process to restore the snippets with noise into the\ncode snippets after evolution. The second category is tasks aiming to reinforce\nthe evolutionary direction. That is, we first generate various intermediate\nversions for each pair of snippets before and after evolution, and then ask the\npre-training process to transform the intermediate versions into the snippet\nafter evolution for each pair. We evaluate DivoT5 for two code-editing\nscenarios and one non-editing scenario using five downstream tasks. Given each\ndownstream task, we fine-tune the pre-trained DivoT5 to evaluate its\neffectiveness. Our experimental results show that DivoT5 achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on most tasks in comparison to models of\nthe same scale (220M), large scale (770M) models in fine-tuning, and\nbillion-scale (6.7B, 8B, ChatGPT) models in few-shot settings. For one\ncode-editing task (i.e., automated code review), DivoT5 pre-trained on top of\nCodeT5-small (60M) can even outperform CodeT5-base (220M) and other pre-trained\nmodels with 220M parameters except for DivoT5 pre-trained on top of CodeT5-base\n(220M).",

Next, for each cluster, we apply a Sharpe ratio-based\noptimization model to derive optimal weights that maximize risk-adjusted\nreturns. Unlike traditional mean-variance optimization, this approach directly\nincorporates the trade-off between returns and volatility, resulting in a more\nbalanced allocation of resources within each cluster.

Inside dense forests, reliance on the Global Navigation\nSatellite System (GNSS) for localization is not feasible. Additionally, the\ndrone must autonomously adjust its flight path to avoid collisions. Recently,\nadvancements in robotics have enabled autonomous drone flights in GNSS-denied\nobstacle-rich areas.

Specifically, the study focused on\ncamera-based autonomous flight under the forest canopy and photogrammetric\npost-processing of the data collected with the low-cost onboard stereo camera.\nThe autonomous flight capability of the prototype was evaluated through\nmultiple test flights at boreal forests.

    "abstract": "When formulating a model there is a trade-off between model complexity and\n(biological) realism. In the present paper we demonstrate how model reduction\nfrom a precise mechanistic \"super model\" to simpler conceptual models using\nTikhonov-Fenichel reductions, an algebraic approach to singular perturbation\ntheory, can mitigate this problem. Compared to traditional methods for time\nscale separations (Tikhonov's theorem, quasi-steady state assumption),\nTikhonov-Fenichel reductions have the advantage that we can compute a reduction\ndirectly for a separation of rates into slow and fast ones instead of a\nseparation of components of the system. Moreover, we can find all such\nreductions algorithmically.\n  In the present paper we use Tikhonov-Fenichel reductions to analyse a\nmutualism model tailored towards lichens with an explicit description of the\ninteraction. We find that (1) the implicit description of the interaction given\nin the reductions by interaction terms (functional responses) varies depending\non the scenario, (2) there is a tendency for the mycobiont, an obligate\nmutualist, to always benefit from the interaction while it can be detrimental\nfor the photobiont, a facultative mutualist, depending on the parameters, (3)\nour model is capable of describing the shift from mutualism to parasitism, (4)\nour model can produce bistability with multiple stable fixed points in the\ninterior of the first orthant. To analyse the reductions we formalize and\ndiscuss a mathematical criterion that categorizes two-species interactions.\nThroughout the paper we focus on the relation between the mathematics behind\nTikhonov-Fenichel reductions and their biological interpretation.",

The\nbi-$\\gamma$-positivity of the $1/k$-Eulerian polynomials $A^{(k)}_{n}(x)$ was\nknown but to give a combinatorial interpretation of the corresponding\nbi-$\\gamma$-coefficients still remains open.

Physics-Informed\nNeural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional\nnumerical methods for solving PDEs. However, the gap between domain-specific\nknowledge and deep learning expertise often limits the practical application of\nPINNs. Previous works typically involve manually conducting extensive PINNs\nexperiments and summarizing heuristic rules for hyperparameter tuning. In this\nwork, we introduce PINNsAgent, a novel surrogation framework that leverages\nlarge language models (LLMs) and utilizes PINNs as a foundation to bridge the\ngap between domain-specific knowledge and deep learning. Specifically,\nPINNsAgent integrates (1) Physics-Guided Knowledge Replay (PGKR), which encodes\nthe essential characteristics of PDEs and their associated best-performing\nPINNs configurations into a structured format, enabling efficient knowledge\ntransfer from solved PDEs to similar problems and (2) Memory Tree Reasoning, a\nstrategy that effectively explores the search space for optimal PINNs\narchitectures. By leveraging LLMs and exploration strategies, PINNsAgent\nenhances the automation and efficiency of PINNs-based solutions. We evaluate\nPINNsAgent on 14 benchmark PDEs, demonstrating its effectiveness in automating\nthe surrogation process and significantly improving the accuracy of PINNs-based\nsolutions.",

    "abstract": "Tomato crop health plays a critical role in ensuring agricultural\nproductivity and food security. Timely and accurate detection of diseases\naffecting tomato plants is vital for effective disease management. In this\nstudy, we propose a deep learning-based approach for Tomato Leaf Disease\nDetection using two well-established convolutional neural networks (CNNs),\nnamely VGG19 and Inception v3. The experiment is conducted on the Tomato\nVillages Dataset, encompassing images of both healthy tomato leaves and leaves\nafflicted by various diseases. The VGG19 model is augmented with fully\nconnected layers, while the Inception v3 model is modified to incorporate a\nglobal average pooling layer and a dense classification layer. Both models are\ntrained on the prepared dataset, and their performances are evaluated on a\nseparate test set. This research employs VGG19 and Inception v3 models on the\nTomato Villages dataset (4525 images) for tomato leaf disease detection. The\nmodels' accuracy of 93.93% with dropout layers demonstrates their usefulness\nfor crop health monitoring. The paper suggests a deep learning-based strategy\nthat includes normalization, resizing, dataset preparation, and unique model\narchitectures. During training, VGG19 and Inception v3 serve as feature\nextractors, with possible data augmentation and fine-tuning.

However, mainstream efforts, which fall short in task\ncoverage, lack fine-grained supervision for intermediate reasoning steps, and\nrely on proprietary systems, are still far from a versatile, credible and\nefficient language model for clinical reasoning usage. To this end, we propose\n\\mone, a self-evolving framework that imparts robust reasoning capabilities to\nsmall, deployable models. Starting with 8,000 curated instances sampled via a\ncurriculum strategy across five medical domains and 16 datasets, we use a small\nbase policy model to conduct Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for constructing\nrule-verifiable reasoning trajectories. Self-explored reasoning trajectories\nranked by node values are used to bootstrap the policy model via reinforcement\nfine-tuning and preference learning. Moreover, we introduce a soft dual process\nreward model that incorporates value dynamics: steps that degrade node value\nare penalized, enabling fine-grained identification of reasoning errors even\nwhen the final answer is correct. Experiments on eleven benchmarks show that\n\\mone outperforms the previous state-of-the-art medical model by +6.45 accuracy\npoints and surpasses 32B-scale general-purpose reasoning models by +8.57\npoints. Additional empirical analysis further demonstrates that \\mone achieves\nrobust and faithful reasoning behavior.",

    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-everything communications-assisted autonomous driving has\nwitnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, with pragmatic\ncommunications (PragComm) emerging as a promising paradigm for real-time\ncollaboration among vehicles and other agents. Simultaneously, extensive\nresearch has explored the interplay between collaborative perception and\ndecision-making in end-to-end driving frameworks. In this work, we revisit the\ncollaborative driving problem and propose the Select2Drive framework to\noptimize the utilization of limited computational and communication resources.\nParticularly, to mitigate cumulative latency in perception and decision-making,\nSelect2Drive introduces distributed predictive perception by formulating an\nactive prediction paradigm and simplifying high-dimensional semantic feature\nprediction into a computation cost-efficient, motion-aware reconstruction.\nGiven the ``less is more\" principle that an over-broadened perceptual horizon\npossibly confuses the decision module rather than contributing to it,\nSelect2Drive utilizes area-of-importance-based PragComm to prioritize the\ncommunications of critical regions, thus boosting both communication efficiency\nand decision-making efficacy. Empirical evaluations on the V2Xverse and\nreal-world DAIR-V2X demonstrate that Select2Drive achieves a $2.60$\\% and\n$1.99$\\% improvement in offline perception tasks under limited bandwidth\n(resp., pose error conditions). Moreover, it delivers at most $8.35$\\% and\n$2.65$\\% enhancement in closed-loop driving scores and route completion rates,\nparticularly in scenarios characterized by dense traffic and high-speed\ndynamics.",

We derive an exact relativistic solution of the\nEinstein field equation using the Tolman-IV metric potential and modified MIT\nbag model EoS, $p_{r}=\\frac{1}{3}(\\rho-4B')$, where $B'$ is a function of bag\nconstant $B$, $m_{s}$ and baryon number density $(n)$. Following CERN's\nfindings, transition of phase from hadronic matter to Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP)\nmay occur at high densities in presence of favourable conditions. The standard\nMIT bag model, with a constant $B$, fails to explain such transition properly.\nIntroducing a finite $m_{s}$ and Wood-Saxon parametrisation for $B$, dependent\non baryon number density $(n)$, provides a more realistic EoS to address such\nphase transition. Both $m_{s}$ and $n$ constrain the EoS, making it softer as\n$m_{s}$ increases. Solutions to the TOV equations reveal that for massless\nstrange quarks, maximum mass is 2.01 $M_{\\odot}$ and corresponding radius is\n10.96 Km when $n=0.66~fm^{-3}$. These values decrease to 1.99 $M_{\\odot}$ and\n1.96 $M_{\\odot}$, with corresponding radii of 10.88 Km and 10.69 Km for\n$m_{s}=50$ and $100~MeV$ respectively having same $n$ value. It is interesting\nto note that a corelation exists between $n$ and $m_{s}$. The hadronic to quark\nmatter transition occurs at higher values of $n$, when $m_{s}$ increases such\nas $n\\geq0.484,~0.489$ and $0.51~fm^{-3}$ for $m_{s}=50$ and $100~MeV$\nrespectively. Beyond these values, the energy per baryon $(\\mathcal{E_{B}})$\ndrops below $930.4~MeV$, indicating a complete transition to quark matter. For\nphysical analysis, we have considered $n~(=0.578~fm^{-3})$ which lies in the\nstable region with $B(n)=70~MeV/fm^{3}$.

This paper proposes a techno-economic analysis of RIS-assisted\ncellular networks to guide operators in deciding between deploying additional\nRISs or base stations (BS). We assume a relative cost model that considers the\ntotal cost of ownership (TCO) of deploying additional nodes, either BSs or\nRISs. We assume a return on investment (RoI) that is proportional to the\nsystem's spectral efficiency. The latter is evaluated based on a stochastic\ngeometry model that gives an integral formula for the ergodic rate in cellular\nnetworks equipped with RISs. The marginal RoI for any investment strategy is\ndetermined by the partial derivative of this integral expression with respect\nto node densities. We investigate two case studies: throughput enhancement and\ncoverage hole mitigation. These examples demonstrate how operators could\ndetermine the optimal investment strategy in scenarios defined by the current\ndensities of BSs and RISs, and their relative costs. Numerical results\nillustrate the evolution of ergodic rates based on the proposed investment\nstrategy, demonstrating the investment decision-making process while\nconsidering technological and economic factors.

We found that with the bolometric luminosity $\\geq 20L_{\\odot}$,\nRATD can destroy aggregate grains of size $1 \\sim 500\\rm \\mu m$ having maximum\ntensile strength $S_{\\rm max} \\leq 10^{5} \\rm erg cm^{-3}$ inside the\njet/outflow base after $< 2$ yrs. This effect lets sub-micron grains dominate\nthe outflow and partially prevent the migration of large grains from the inner\ndisk to inner envelope. In contrast, RATD cannot prevent the migration of\ncomposite VLGs and submillimeter grains having $S_{\\rm max}\\geq 10^{7} \\rm erg\ncm^{-3}$. Next, we incorporate RATD into POLARIS, assuming grains are not\nmoving relative to the gas. We found that POLARIS works well in describing the\ndisruption for aggregate grains, but overestimates the disruption efficiency\nfor composite grains. The observed polarization degree can be reduced by twice\nwhen aggregate grains are removed from the outflow cavity wall and inner\nenvelope by RATD. However, RATD is not an important factor controlling dust\npolarization properties as iron inclusions do.",

    "abstract": "Ionic polymer actuators, in essence, consist of ion exchange polymers\nsandwiched between layers of electrodes. They have recently gained recognition\nas promising candidates for soft actuators due to their lightweight nature,\nnoise-free operation, and low-driving voltages. However, the materials\ntraditionally utilized to develop them are often not human/environmentally\nfriendly. Thus, to address this issue, researchers have been focusing on\ndeveloping biocompatible versions of this actuator. Despite this, such\nactuators still face challenges in achieving high performance, in payload\ncapacity, bending capabilities, and response time. In this paper, we present a\nbiocompatible ionic polymer actuator whose membrane is fully 3D printed\nutilizing a direct ink writing method. The structure of the printed membranes\nconsists of biodegradable ionic fluid encapsulated within layers of activated\ncarbon polymers. From the microscopic observations of its structure, we\nconfirmed that the ionic polymer is well encapsulated. The actuators can\nachieve a bending performance of up to 124$^\\circ$ (curvature of 0.82\n$\\text{cm}^{-1}$), which, to our knowledge, is the highest curvature attained\nby any bending ionic polymer actuator to date. It can operate comfortably up to\na 2 Hz driving frequency and can achieve blocked forces of up to 0.76 mN. Our\nresults showcase a promising, high-performing biocompatible ionic polymer\nactuator, whose membrane can be easily manufactured in a single step using a\nstandard FDM 3D printer. This approach paves the way for creating customized\ndesigns for functional soft robotic applications, including human-interactive\ndevices, in the near future.",

We investigate FPJR's properties and find that it shares\nPJR's advantages over EJR: several proportionality axioms (e.g. priceability,\nperfect representation) imply FPJR and PJR but not EJR. We also find that\nefficient rules like the greedy Monroe rule and the method of equal shares\nsatisfy FPJR, matching a key advantage of EJR over FJR. However, the\nProportional Approval Voting (PAV) rule may violate FPJR, so neither of EJR and\nFPJR implies the other.",

Observational data from photometric\nsurveys reveal a strong stellar mass trend, with higher-mass star-forming\ngalaxies being systematically more dust-reddened. Aims. We analyze the UVJ\ndiagram in the TNG100 cosmological simulation at cosmic noon ($z\\approx2$).\nSpecifically, we focus on the trend between UVJ colors and mass which has not\nbeen reproduced in any cosmological simulation thus far. Methods. We applied\nthe SKIRT dust radiative transfer code to the TNG100 simulation to generate\nrest-frame UVJ fluxes. These UVJ colors were then compared to observational\ndata from several well-studied extragalactic fields from the CANDELS/3D-HST\nprograms, augmented by recent JWST/NIRCam photometry. Results. Quiescent and\nlow-mass ($M_\\star\\lesssim10^{10.5}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) galaxies at cosmic noon\ndo not require significant levels of dust reddening, as opposed to massive\n($M_\\star\\gtrsim10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) star-forming galaxies. An extensive\nrange of possible dust models fall short of the required dust reddening in V-J\ncolor for massive star-forming galaxies, with the simulated galaxies being too\nblue by $\\approx0.9\\,\\mathrm{mag}$. Conclusions. We find that only variations\nin the star-to-dust geometries of the simulated galaxies can yield V-J colors\nthat are red enough to match the observations. A toy model with isolated dust\nscreens around younger stellar populations (with ages below\n$\\sim1\\,\\mathrm{Gyr}$) can reproduce the observational data, while all\nconventional dust radiative transfer models (where the dust distribution\nfollows the metals in the interstellar medium) fail to achieve the required V-J\ncolors.",

Our approach is founded on the\nrecently introduced recursion-theoretical schematic definitions of time-bounded\nquantum functions, which map finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces to themselves.\nThe quantum first-order logic (QFO) in this work therefore looks quite\ndifferent from the well-known old concept of quantum logic based on lattice\ntheory.

Both surveys used the\nSPHERE@VLT instrument with the IRDIS dual band imager in conjunction with the\nintegral field spectrograph IFS and the angular differential imaging observing\ntechnique. All SHINE data (650 datasets), corresponding to 400 stars, including\nthe targets of the F150 survey, are processed in a uniform manner with an\nadvanced post-processing algorithm called PACO ASDI. An emphasis is put on the\nclassification and identification of the most promising candidate companions.\nCompared to the previous early analysis SHINE F150, the use of advanced\npost-processing techniques significantly improved by one or 2 magnitudes\n(x3-x6) the contrast detection limits, which will allow us to put even tighter\nconstraints on the radial distribution of young gas giants. This increased\nsensitivity directly places SHINE as the largest and deepest direct imaging\nsurvey ever conducted. We detected and classified more than 3500 physical\nsources. One additional substellar companion has been confirmed during the\nsecond phase of the survey (HIP 74865 B), and several new promising candidate\ncompanions are awaiting second epoch confirmations.",

Early experimental\nefforts have already demonstrated its potential to surpass the charging power\nof existing technologies. In this context, it is crucial to identify the\nspecific quantum effects that can be exploited to design the most efficient\nquantum batteries and push their performance to the ultimate limit. While\nentanglement has often been considered a key factor in enhancing charging (or\ndischarging) power, our findings reveal that it is not as critical as\npreviously thought. Instead, three parameters emerge as the most significant in\ndetermining the upper bound of instantaneous charging power: the locality of\nthe battery and charger Hamiltonians, and the maximum energy storable in a\nsingle unit cell of the battery. To derive this new bound, we have also\naddressed several open questions previously noted in the literature but lacks\nan explanation. This bound provides a foundation for designing the most\npowerful charger-battery systems, where combined optimization of both\ncomponents offers enhancements that cannot be achieved by manipulating only one\nof them.",

    "abstract": "The rapid rise of real-time communication and large language models has\nsignificantly increased the importance of speech compression. Deep\nlearning-based neural speech codecs have outperformed traditional signal-level\nspeech codecs in terms of rate-distortion (RD) performance. Typically, these\nneural codecs employ an encoder-quantizer-decoder architecture, where audio is\nfirst converted into latent code feature representations and then into discrete\ntokens. However, this architecture exhibits insufficient RD performance due to\ntwo main drawbacks: (1) the inadequate performance of the quantizer,\nchallenging training processes, and issues such as codebook collapse; (2) the\nlimited representational capacity of the encoder and decoder, making it\ndifficult to meet feature representation requirements across various bitrates.\nIn this paper, we propose a rate-aware learned speech compression scheme that\nreplaces the quantizer with an advanced channel-wise entropy model to improve\nRD performance, simplify training, and avoid codebook collapse. We employ\nmulti-scale convolution and linear attention mixture blocks to enhance the\nrepresentational capacity and flexibility of the encoder and decoder.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves\nstate-of-the-art RD performance, obtaining 53.51% BD-Rate bitrate saving in\naverage, and achieves 0.26 BD-VisQol and 0.44 BD-PESQ gains.",

We propose a method to retrieve the initial distribution of telomere\nlengths, using only measurements of senescence times. Our approach relies on\napproximating our models with transport equations, which provide natural\nestimators for the initial telomere lengths distribution.

    "abstract": "Long-range frequency-hopping spread spectrum (LR-FHSS) promises to enhance\nnetwork capacity by integrating frequency hopping into existing Long Range Wide\nArea Networks (LoRaWANs). Due to its simplicity and scalability, LR-FHSS has\ngenerated significant interest as a potential candidate for direct-to-satellite\nIoT (D2S-IoT) applications. This paper explores methods to improve the\nreliability of data transfer on the uplink (i.e., from terrestrial IoT nodes to\nsatellite) of LR-FHSS D2S-IoT networks.\n  Because D2S-IoT networks are expected to support large numbers of potentially\nuncoordinated IoT devices per satellite,\nacknowledgment-cum-retransmission-aided reliability mechanisms are not suitable\ndue to their lack of scalability. We therefore leverage message-replication,\nwherein every application-layer message is transmitted multiple times to\nimprove the probability of reception without the use of receiver\nacknowledgments. We propose two message-replication schemes. One scheme is\nbased on conventional replication, where multiple replicas of a message are\ntransmitted, each as a separate link-layer frame. In the other scheme, multiple\ncopies of a message is included in the payload of a single link-layer frame. We\nshow that both techniques improve LR-FHSS reliability. Which method is more\nsuitable depends on the network's traffic characteristics. We provide\nguidelines to choose the optimal method.",

This study\ndeals with small sample survival analysis by leveraging transfer learning, a\nuseful machine learning technique that can enhance the target analysis with\nrelated knowledge pre-learned from other data. We propose and develop various\ntransfer learning methods designed for common survival models. For parametric\nmodels such as DeepSurv, Cox-CC (Cox-based neural networks), and DeepHit\n(end-to-end deep learning model), we apply standard transfer learning\ntechniques like pretraining and fine-tuning. For non-parametric models such as\nRandom Survival Forest, we propose a new transfer survival forest (TSF) model\nthat transfers tree structures from source tasks and fine-tunes them with\ntarget data. We evaluated the transfer learning methods on colorectal cancer\n(CRC) prognosis. The source data are 27,379 SEER CRC stage I patients, and the\ntarget data are 728 CRC stage I patients from the West China Hospital. When\nenhanced by transfer learning, Cox-CC's $C^{td}$ value was boosted from 0.7868\nto 0.8111, DeepHit's from 0.8085 to 0.8135, DeepSurv's from 0.7722 to 0.8043,\nand RSF's from 0.7940 to 0.8297 (the highest performance).

To achieve better trade-off between accuracy and\nefficiency, we propose Sparse Mamba (SMamba), which performs adaptive\nsparsification to reduce computational effort while maintaining global modeling\ncapability. Specifically, a Spatio-Temporal Continuity Assessment module is\nproposed to measure the information content of tokens and discard uninformative\nones by leveraging the spatiotemporal distribution differences between activity\nand noise events. Based on the assessment results, an Information-Prioritized\nLocal Scan strategy is designed to shorten the scan distance between\nhigh-information tokens, facilitating interactions among them in the spatial\ndimension. Furthermore, to extend the global interaction from 2D space to 3D\nrepresentations, a Global Channel Interaction module is proposed to aggregate\nchannel information from a global spatial perspective. Results on three\ndatasets (Gen1, 1Mpx, and eTram) demonstrate that our model outperforms other\nmethods in both performance and efficiency.",

With increasing rod packing, we identify nematic and solid\nphases and find that the nematic-crystal phase transition happens at a uniform\npacking fraction ($\\eta_c \\approx 0.82$), independent of the spherocylinder\naspect ratio. This value is considerably higher than the well-known critical\nfreezing transition of a hard disk fluid ($\\eta_c \\approx 0.7$) to which one\ncould naively map a system of near-parallel rods with co-planar mass centers.\nWe attribute this difference to a non-vanishing residual orientational entropy\nper rod.

Introduction of electrostatic interactions between the rods reduces the\nlateral compressibility of the monolayer fluid but keeps the positional order\nunhindered, which in turn maintains the packing fraction at the nematic-crystal\ntransition.

This approach\nfundamentally differs from the widely used multiplicative decomposition of the\ndeformation gradient, as the intermediate configuration, a concept that remains\ndebated, becomes unnecessary. The advent of the concept of generalized strains\nallows the Green-Naghdi assumption to be employed with different strains,\noffering a flexible mechanism to separate inelastic deformation from total\ndeformation. This leads to a constitutive theory in which the kinematic\nseparation is adjustable and can be calibrated. For quadratic configurational\nfree energy, the framework yields a suite of finite linear viscoelasticity\nmodels governed by linear evolution equations. Notably, these models recover\nestablished models, including those by Green and Tobolsky (1946) and Simo\n(1987), when the Seth-Hill strain is chosen with the strain parameter being -2\nand 2, respectively. It is also related to the model of Miehe and Keck (2000)\nwhen the strain is of the Hencky type. We further extend the approach by\nadopting coercive strains, which allows us to define an elastic deformation\ntensor locally. This facilitates modeling the viscous branch using general\nforms of the configurational free energy, and we construct a micromechanical\nviscoelastic model as a representative instantiation. The constitutive\nintegration algorithms of the proposed models are detailed. We employ the\nexperimental data of VHB 4910 to examine the proposed models, which demonstrate\ntheir effectiveness and potential advantages in the quality of fitting and\nprediction.

Our attack\nmanipulates the BRC20 token transfers in open markets and disrupts the fairness\namong bidding participants. The long-standing principle of ``highest bidder\nwins'' is rendered ineffective.\n  Typically, open BRC20 token markets rely on Partially Signed Bitcoin\nTransactions (PSBT) to broadcast selling intents and wait for buying auctions.\nOur attack targets the BRC20 buying process (i.e., transfer) by injecting a\nfront-running transaction to complete the full signature of the PSBT. At its\ncore, the attack exploits the mempool's fee-based transaction selection\nmechanism to snipe the victim transaction, replicate metadata, and front-run\nthe legesmate transaction. This attack applies to platforms using PSBT for\nBRC20 token transfers, including popular Bitcoin exchanges and marketplaces\n(e.g., Magic Eden, Unisat, Gate.io, OKX).\n  We implemented and tested the attack on a Bitcoin testnet (regtest),\nvalidating its effectiveness through multiple experimental rounds. Results show\nthat the attacker consistently replaces legitimate transactions by submitting\nhigher-fee PSBTs. We have also made responsible disclosures to the mentioned\nexchanges.",

To address this\nchallenge, physics-informed intelligent learning methods have recently emerged,\nsignificantly improving generation efficiency while maintaining high mesh\nquality. However, physics-informed methods fail to generalize when applied to\npreviously unseen geometries, as even small changes in the boundary shape\nnecessitate burdensome retraining to adapt to new geometric variations. In this\npaper, we introduce MeshONet, the first generalizable intelligent learning\nmethod for structured mesh generation. The method transforms the mesh\ngeneration task into an operator learning problem with multiple input and\nsolution functions. To effectively overcome the multivariable mapping\nrestriction of operator learning methods, we propose a dual-branch,\nshared-trunk architecture to approximate the mapping between function spaces\nbased on input-output pairs. Experimental results show that MeshONet achieves a\nspeedup of up to four orders of magnitude in generation efficiency over\ntraditional methods.

Further studies have pointed\nout that BTRS is caused by the formation of a new state of matter associated\nwith the condensation of pairs of electron pairs. Despite exhibiting multiple\nunconventional effects that warrant further investigation, the electronic\nspectral properties of this electron quadrupling state remain largely\nunexplored. Here, we present detailed $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance\n(NMR) measurements of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, with $x = 0.77$, which has\n$T_{\\rm c}^{\\rm Z2}$ > $T_{\\rm c}$ according to measurements of the spontaneous\nNernst effect. The NMR data obtained in this work provide the first direct\nelectronic spectral characteristics of the electron quadrupling state by\nindicating that it evolves from a pseudogap that sets in at $T^*$ well above\n$T_{\\rm c}^{\\rm Z2}$. This pseudogap behavior is consistent with $\\mu$SR\nKnight-shift, specific-heat, and transport data indicating the formation of a\nbound state of electrons. According to a theory of electron quadrupling\ncondensates, such bound-state formations should precede the onset of BTRS\ncorrelations between pairs of electron pairs. The second important insight from\nNMR data is the absence of spin-related magnetism. The temperature dependence\nof the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1T$ and the evolution of the NMR\nlinewidth prove the absence of a magnetic transition at $T_{\\rm c}^{\\rm Z2}$\nand rule out even a proximity to some magnetic instability. This indicates that\nthe spontaneous magnetic fields detected in this compound are not caused by\nspin magnetism but are associated with persistent real-space currents.",

Novel\nelectrolytes are essential for enhancing electrolyte structure and ensuring\nbetter integration with modern electrode systems. Herein, we report a novel\nweakly solvated ether electrolyte (WSEE) composed of a pure fluorinated ether\nsolvent, which results in an anion-rich solvation structure even at a low salt\nconcentration of 1 M. To explore this, we selected the advanced fluorinated\nsolvent 2,2-difluoroethyl methyl ether (FEME) and compared it with dipropyl\nether (DPE), ethylene carbonate (EC), and diethyl carbonate (DEC). The prepared\nelectrolyte systems include DPE with 1 M, 1.8 M, and 4 M LiFSI; FEME with 1 M,\n1.8 M, and 4 M LiFSI; and a 1:1 vol% EC/DEC mixture containing 1 M LiPF6. In\nthis work, we comprehensively investigate the Li+ solvation structures using\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations. Our computational findings indicate the presence of large ion\naggregates (AGGs) in each DPE- and FEME-based electrolyte, while SSIPs (68%)\nare the dominant species in the mixed EC/DEC electrolyte. Notably, the\nformation of large ion aggregates is more pronounced in FEME-based\nelectrolytes. We find that, similar to DPE, the FEME solvent also exhibits weak\nsolvating power across all examined salt concentrations. More specifically, we\nfind that FEME has weaker solvating power than DPE. This behavior is predicted\nby MD simulations, which indicate a strong preference for Li+ ions to\ncoordinate with FSI- anions within the primary solvation shell. Furthermore,\nthe quantum mechanical features of the Li+ solvation structures in these\nelectrolytes are analyzed in detail using DFT. We anticipate that this study\nwill provide valuable insights into the Li+ solvation structures in DPE, FEME,\nand EC/DEC electrolytes.",

The availability of open source trained\nmodels based on modern frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, video\nmanipulations Apps such as FaceApp and REFACE, and economical computing\ninfrastructure has easen the creation of deepfakes.

This paper presents a unified framework that exploits the\npower of proposed feature fusion of hybrid facial landmarks and our novel heart\nrate features for detection of all types of deepfakes. We propose novel heart\nrate features and fused them with the facial landmark features to better\nextract the facial artifacts of fake videos and natural variations available in\nthe original videos. We used these features to train a light-weight XGBoost to\nclassify between the deepfake and bonafide videos. We evaluated the performance\nof our framework on the world leaders dataset (WLDR) that contains all types of\ndeepfakes.

    "abstract": "In frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, acquiring channel state\ninformation (CSI) at the base station (BS) traditionally relies on limited\nfeedback from mobile terminals (MTs). However, the accuracy of channel\nreconstruction from feedback CSI is inherently constrained by the\nrate-distortion trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\nmulti-modal channel reconstruction framework that leverages auxiliary data,\nsuch as RGB images or uplink CSI, collected at the BS. By integrating\ncontextual information from these modalities, the framework mitigates CSI\ndistortions caused by noise, compression, and quantization. At its core, the\nframework utilizes an autoencoder network capable of generating variable-length\nCSI, tailored for rate-adaptive multi-modal channel reconstruction. By\naugmenting the foundational autoencoder network using a transfer learning-based\nmulti-modal fusion strategy, we enable accurate channel reconstruction in both\nsingle-modal and multi-modal scenarios. To train and evaluate the network under\ndiverse and realistic wireless conditions, we construct a synthetic dataset\nthat pairs wireless channel data with sensor data through 3D modeling and ray\ntracing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves\nnear-optimal beamforming gains in 5G New Radio (5G NR)-compliant scenarios,\nhighlighting the potential of sensor data integration to improve CSI\nreconstruction accuracy.",

Based on the three level\nof scenario abstraction theory, a testing can be performed within a logical\nscenario, followed by an evaluation stage which is inputted with the testing\nresults of each concrete scenario generated from the logical parameter space.\nDuring the above process, abundant testing information is produced which is\nbeneficial for comprehensive and accurate evaluations. To make full use of\ntesting information, this paper proposes an Integrated accelerated Testing and\nEvaluation Method (ITEM). Based on a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) paradigm\nand a dual surrogates testing framework proposed in our previous work, this\npaper applies the intermediate information (i.e., the tree structure, including\nthe affiliation of each historical sampled point with the subspaces and the\nparent-child relationship between subspaces) generated during the testing stage\ninto the evaluation stage to achieve accurate hazardous domain identification.\nMoreover, to better serve this purpose, the UCB calculation method is improved\nto allow the search algorithm to focus more on the hazardous domain boundaries.\nFurther, a stopping condition is constructed based on the convergence of the\nsearch algorithm. Ablation and comparative experiments are then conducted to\nverify the effectiveness of the improvements and the superiority of the\nproposed method.

    "abstract": "Goal-oriented communications prioritize application-driven objectives over\ndata accuracy, enabling intelligent next-generation wireless systems. Efficient\nscheduling in multi-device, multi-channel systems poses significant challenges\ndue to high-dimensional state and action spaces. We address these challenges by\nderiving key structural properties of the optimal solution to the goal-oriented\nscheduling problem, incorporating Age of Information (AoI) and channel states.\nSpecifically, we establish the monotonicity of the optimal state value function\n(a measure of long-term system performance) w.r.t. channel states and prove its\nasymptotic convexity w.r.t. AoI states. Additionally, we derive the\nmonotonicity of the optimal policy w.r.t. channel states, advancing the\ntheoretical framework for optimal scheduling. Leveraging these insights, we\npropose the structure-guided unified dual on-off policy DRL (SUDO-DRL), a\nhybrid algorithm that combines the stability of on-policy training with the\nsample efficiency of off-policy methods. Through a novel structural property\nevaluation framework, SUDO-DRL enables effective and scalable training,\naddressing the complexities of large-scale systems. Numerical results show\nSUDO-DRL improves system performance by up to 45% and reduces convergence time\nby 40% compared to state-of-the-art methods. It also effectively handles\nscheduling in much larger systems, where off-policy DRL fails and on-policy\nbenchmarks exhibit significant performance loss, demonstrating its scalability\nand efficacy in goal-oriented communications.",

    "abstract": "Incomplete scenario is a prevalent, practical, yet challenging setting in\nMultimodal Recommendations (MMRec), where some item modalities are missing due\nto various factors. Recently, a few efforts have sought to improve the\nrecommendation accuracy by exploring generic structures from incomplete data.\nHowever, two significant gaps persist: 1) the difficulty in accurately\ngenerating missing data due to the limited ability to capture modality\ndistributions; and 2) the critical but overlooked visibility bias, where items\nwith missing modalities are more likely to be disregarded due to the\nprioritization of items' multimodal data over user preference alignment. This\nbias raises serious concerns about the fair treatment of items. To bridge these\ntwo gaps, we propose a novel Modality-Diffused Counterfactual (MoDiCF)\nframework for incomplete multimodal recommendations. MoDiCF features two key\nmodules: a novel modality-diffused data completion module and a new\ncounterfactual multimodal recommendation module. The former, equipped with a\nparticularly designed multimodal generative framework, accurately generates and\niteratively refines missing data from learned modality-specific distribution\nspaces. The latter, grounded in the causal perspective, effectively mitigates\nthe negative causal effects of visibility bias and thus assures fairness in\nrecommendations. Both modules work collaboratively to address the two\naforementioned significant gaps for generating more accurate and fair results.\nExtensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior\nperformance of MoDiCF in terms of both recommendation accuracy and fairness.\nThe code and processed datasets are released at\nhttps://github.com/JinLi-i/MoDiCF.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a\nwide range of tasks, yet their application to specialized domains remains\nchallenging due to the need for deep expertise. Retrieval-Augmented generation\n(RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to customize LLMs for professional\nfields by seamlessly integrating external knowledge bases, enabling real-time\naccess to domain-specific expertise during inference. Despite its potential,\ntraditional RAG systems, based on flat text retrieval, face three critical\nchallenges: (i) complex query understanding in professional contexts, (ii)\ndifficulties in knowledge integration across distributed sources, and (iii)\nsystem efficiency bottlenecks at scale. This survey presents a systematic\nanalysis of Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG), a new\nparadigm that revolutionizes domain-specific LLM applications. GraphRAG\naddresses traditional RAG limitations through three key innovations: (i)\ngraph-structured knowledge representation that explicitly captures entity\nrelationships and domain hierarchies, (ii) efficient graph-based retrieval\ntechniques that enable context-preserving knowledge retrieval with multihop\nreasoning ability, and (iii) structure-aware knowledge integration algorithms\nthat leverage retrieved knowledge for accurate and logical coherent generation\nof LLMs. In this survey, we systematically analyze the technical foundations of\nGraphRAG and examine current implementations across various professional\ndomains, identifying key technical challenges and promising research\ndirections.

The results showed that mental health\nissues were not distributed uniformly, with higher frequency found in Western\nand Nairobi regions. Possible connections between HIV, TB, and STIs with mental\nhealth have been suggested by the substantial correlation found between\ninfectious diseases and mental health issues.

Shifting spectra by the peak in emission, 'primary' components\nshifted to 0 km s$^{-1}$ are correctly averaged. Additional components on\nindividual sightlines are averaged with non-centred velocities, producing a\nbroader and shallower 'secondary' component in the resulting stack. Peak\noptical depths and brightness temperatures of the secondary components from\nstacks are lower limits of their true average values due to the velocity offset\nof each component. The spin temperature however is well correlated with the\ntruth since the velocity offset of components affects the emission and\nabsorption spectra equally.

Without requiring deep technical expertise, they can inform on the\ntrade-off between predictive performance and resource efficiency. However, the\npractical benefits and limitations of AI labeling remain underexplored. This\nstudy evaluates AI labeling through qualitative interviews along four key\nresearch questions. Based on thematic analysis and inductive coding, we found a\nbroad range of practitioners to be interested in AI labeling (RQ1). They see\nbenefits for alleviating communication gaps and aiding non-expert\ndecision-makers, however limitations, misunderstandings, and suggestions for\nimprovement were also discussed (RQ2). Compared to other reporting formats,\ninterviewees positively evaluated the reduced complexity of labels, increasing\noverall comprehensibility (RQ3). Trust was influenced most by usability and the\ncredibility of the responsible labeling authority, with mixed preferences for\nself-certification versus third-party certification (RQ4). Our Insights\nhighlight that AI labels pose a trade-off between simplicity and complexity,\nwhich could be resolved by developing customizable and interactive labeling\nframeworks to address diverse user needs. Transparent labeling of resource\nefficiency also nudged interviewee priorities towards paying more attention to\nsustainability aspects during AI development.

Exact reconstruction\nof the signal's direction is possible: we can reformulate it as a linear\ncompressed sensing problem and use basis pursuit (i.e., constrained norm\nminimization). For $\\mathbf{\\Phi}$ with i.i.d. complex-valued Gaussian entries,\nthis paper shows that the phase transition is approximately located at the\nstatistical dimension of the descent cone of a signal-dependent norm.\nLeveraging this insight, we derive asymptotically precise formulas for the\nphase transition locations in phase-only sensing of both sparse signals and\nlow-rank matrices. Our results prove that the minimum number of measurements\nrequired for exact recovery is smaller for phase-only measurements than for\ntraditional linear compressed sensing. For instance, in recovering a 1-sparse\nsignal with sufficiently large dimension, phase-only compressed sensing\nrequires approximately 68% of the measurements needed for linear compressed\nsensing. This result disproves earlier conjecture suggesting that the two phase\ntransitions coincide.

    "abstract": "Common methods for aligning already-capable models with desired behavior rely\non the ability of humans to provide supervision. However, future superhuman\nmodels will surpass the capability of humans. Therefore, humans will only be\nable to weakly supervise superhuman models. This expected deficiency of human\nevaluation would weaken the safety of future AI systems. Scalable oversight and\nweak-to-strong generalization are two complementary approaches to tackle this\nissue. In this paper, we attempt to combine the strengths of these two\napproaches to further improve alignment. Specifically, we investigate ways of\nimproving human supervision with a strong pretrained model and then supervise\nthe strong model with enhanced weak human supervision. To make iterative\nempirical progress, we consider an analogy: can we use a strong model to\nimprove weak model supervision and then use it to supervise the strong model?\nWe empirically test it by finetuning a small weak model on ground truth labels\nwith the additional help from a large strong model, and then finetuning the\nstrong model on labels generated by the weak model. We find that debate can\nassist a weak model in extracting trustworthy information from an untrustworthy\nstrong model, which provides leverage as context on samples when training a\nweak model. We also show that an ensemble of weak models helps exploit long\narguments generated by strong model debaters and obtain a more robust\nsupervision estimate. Extensive experiments on the OpenAI weak-to-strong NLP\nbenchmarks show that the combination approach leads to better alignment, which\nindicates that debate has the potential to help weak-to-strong generalization.",

    "abstract": "Active Speaker Detection (ASD) aims to identify speaking individuals in\ncomplex visual scenes. While humans can easily detect speech by matching lip\nmovements to audio, current ASD models struggle to establish this\ncorrespondence, often misclassifying non-speaking instances when audio and lip\nmovements are unsynchronized. To address this limitation, we propose Lip\nlandmark Assisted Speaker dEtection for Robustness (LASER). Unlike models that\nrely solely on facial frames, LASER explicitly focuses on lip movements by\nintegrating lip landmarks in training. Specifically, given a face track, LASER\nextracts frame-level visual features and the 2D coordinates of lip landmarks\nusing a lightweight detector. These coordinates are encoded into dense feature\nmaps, providing spatial and structural information on lip positions.\nRecognizing that landmark detectors may sometimes fail under challenging\nconditions (e.g., low resolution, occlusions, extreme angles), we incorporate\nan auxiliary consistency loss to align predictions from both lip-aware and\nface-only features, ensuring reliable performance even when lip data is absent.\nExtensive experiments across multiple datasets show that LASER outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models, especially in scenarios with desynchronized audio and\nvisuals, demonstrating robust performance in real-world video contexts.

    "abstract": "Robots, particularly in service and companionship roles, must develop\npositive relationships with people they interact with regularly to be\nsuccessful. These positive human-robot relationships can be characterized as\nestablishing \"rapport,\" which indicates mutual understanding and interpersonal\nconnection that form the groundwork for successful long-term human-robot\ninteraction. However, the human-robot interaction research literature lacks\nscale instruments to assess human-robot rapport in a variety of situations. In\nthis work, we developed the 18-item Connection-Coordination Rapport (CCR) Scale\nto measure human-robot rapport. We first ran Study 1 (N = 288) where online\nparticipants rated videos of human-robot interactions using a set of candidate\nitems. Our Study 1 results showed the discovery of two factors in our scale,\nwhich we named \"Connection\" and \"Coordination.\" We then evaluated this scale by\nrunning Study 2 (N = 201) where online participants rated a new set of\nhuman-robot interaction videos with our scale and an existing rapport scale\nfrom virtual agents research for comparison. We also validated our scale by\nreplicating a prior in-person human-robot interaction study, Study 3 (N = 44),\nand found that rapport is rated significantly greater when participants\ninteracted with a responsive robot (responsive condition) as opposed to an\nunresponsive robot (unresponsive condition). Results from these studies\ndemonstrate high reliability and validity for the CCR scale, which can be used\nto measure rapport in both first-person and third-person perspectives. We\nencourage the adoption of this scale in future studies to measure rapport in a\nvariety of human-robot interactions.",

    "abstract": "Different variants of the Hadron Resonance Gas model have been used to\ndescribe the hadronic phase of strongly interacting matter. HRG model is\nimproved by including repulsive interaction through the inclusion of excluded\nvolume in Excluded Volume Hadron Resonance Gas (EVHRG) model. Here, the EVHRG\nmodel is further improved by incorporating unequal radii of hadrons which has\nbeen named as Modified Excluded Volume Hadron Resonance Gas (MEVHRG) model and\nalso by taking their Lorentz contraction in Lorentz contracted MEVHRG model,\nnamely, LMEVHRG model. Another way of incorporating the repulsive interactions\nin the HRG model is through the introduction of a mean-field potential. This is\ndone in the HRG mean-field (HRGMF) model where the single particle energies are\nmodified by a density dependent term. Both the inclusion of unequal radii and\nthe Lorentz contraction have significant effects on the thermodynamic\nquantities and susceptibilities of conserved charges. The centre of mass energy\ndependence of some thermodynamic quantities in presence of repulsive\ninteraction has been studied. Our study clearly indicates that proper modelling\nof repulsive interaction among hadrons is very important to explain the\nthermodynamic quantities and susceptibilities of conserved charges. The effect\nof static magnetic field in HRG and EVHRG models by the means of Landau levels\nhas also been investigated. The vacuum part of the pressure, in presence of\nmagnetic field, has been properly renormalised. The magnetic field is found to\neffect the thermodynamic quantities and the susceptibilities significantly. The\nelectric charge susceptibility is influenced more strongly by the magnetic\nfield than the baryon susceptibility. The total magnetization of hadronic\nmatter is found to be positive.",

    "abstract": "Underwater scene reconstruction poses a substantial challenge because of the\nintricate interplay between light and the medium, resulting in scattering and\nabsorption effects that make both depth estimation and rendering more complex.\nWhile recent Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based methods for underwater scenes\nachieve high-quality results by modeling and separating the scattering medium,\nthey still suffer from slow training and rendering speeds. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel method that integrates Multi-View Stereo (MVS)\nwith a physics-based underwater image formation model. Our approach consists of\ntwo branches: one for depth estimation using the traditional cost volume\npipeline of MVS, and the other for rendering based on the physics-based image\nformation model. The depth branch improves scene geometry, while the medium\nbranch determines the scattering parameters to achieve precise scene rendering.\nUnlike traditional MVSNet methods that rely on ground-truth depth, our method\ndoes not necessitate the use of depth truth, thus allowing for expedited\ntraining and rendering processes. By leveraging the medium subnet to estimate\nthe medium parameters and combining this with a color MLP for rendering, we\nrestore the true colors of underwater scenes and achieve higher-fidelity\ngeometric representations. Experimental results show that our method enables\nhigh-quality synthesis of novel views in scattering media, clear views\nrestoration by removing the medium, and outperforms existing methods in\nrendering quality and training efficiency.",

In a\nprevious paper by the authors, we derived an improved lower bound on the OT\ncapacity of BSC by proposing a method to recursively emulate BSEC via\ninteractive communication. In this paper, we introduce two new ideas of OT\nconstruction: (i) via ``polarization\" and interactive communication, we\nrecursively emulate GECs that are not necessarily a BSEC; (ii) in addition to\nthe GEC emulation part, we also utilize interactive communication in the key\nagreement part of OT protocol. By these methods, we derive lower bounds on the\nOT capacity of BSC that are superior to the previous one for a certain range of\ncrossover probabilities of the BSC.

At sufficiently large $N$,\nthis is possibly probed by ensemble-averaged (\"stacked\") rotation curves (RCs)\nat resolutions on par with present estimates of the Hubble parameter $H_0$.\nHere, we consider the prospect for studies using the large $N$ Mapping Nearby\nGalaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) at APO survey.

To address this\nlimitation, this paper presents a novel approach to wireless indoor\nlocalization by reformulating it as an inverse problem of wireless ray-tracing,\ninferring scene parameters that generates the measured CSI. At the core of our\nsolution is a fully differentiable ray-tracing simulator that enables\nbackpropagation to comprehensive parameters of the sensing scene, allowing for\nprecise localization. To establish a robust localization context, RayLoc\nconstructs a high-fidelity sensing scene by refining coarse-grained background\nmodel.

Averaging across all\nMIRS items and OSCE cases, LLMs performed with low exact accuracy (0.27 to\n0.44), and moderate to high off-by-one accuracy (0.67 to 0.87) and thresholded\naccuracy (0.75 to 0.88).

Specifically, LBL for MoEs is defined as $N_E\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N_E} f_i p_i$, where $N_E$ is the total number of experts, $f_i$\nrepresents the frequency of expert $i$ being selected, and $p_i$ denotes the\naverage gating score of the expert $i$. Existing MoE training frameworks\nusually employ the parallel training strategy so that $f_i$ and the LBL are\ncalculated within a $\\textbf{micro-batch}$ and then averaged across parallel\ngroups. In essence, a micro-batch for training billion-scale LLMs normally\ncontains very few sequences. So, the micro-batch LBL is almost at the sequence\nlevel, and the router is pushed to distribute the token evenly within each\nsequence. Under this strict constraint, even tokens from a domain-specific\nsequence ($\\textit{e.g.}$, code) are uniformly routed to all experts, thereby\ninhibiting expert specialization. In this work, we propose calculating LBL\nusing a $\\textbf{global-batch}$ to loose this constraint. Because a\nglobal-batch contains much more diverse sequences than a micro-batch, which\nwill encourage load balance at the corpus level. Specifically, we introduce an\nextra communication step to synchronize $f_i$ across micro-batches and then use\nit to calculate the LBL. Through experiments on training MoEs-based LLMs (up to\n$\\textbf{42.8B}$ total parameters and $\\textbf{400B}$ tokens), we surprisingly\nfind that the global-batch LBL strategy yields excellent performance gains in\nboth pre-training perplexity and downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals that\nthe global-batch LBL also greatly improves the domain specialization of MoE\nexperts.",

Pulse profiles are detected across a range of frequencies from 26 to 88\nMHz, including new narrow-band profiles facilitating profile evolution studies\nand breaks in pulsar spectra at low frequencies. We report mean flux density,\nspectral index, curvature, and low-frequency turnover frequency measurements\nfor 97 pulsars, including new measurements for 61 sources. Multi-frequency\nprofile widths are presented for all pulsars, including component spacing for\n27 pulsars with two components. Polarized emission is detected from 27 of the\nsources (the largest sample at these frequencies) in multiple frequency bands,\nwith one new detection. We also provide new timing solutions for five\nrecently-discovered pulsars. Low-frequency observations with the LWA are\nespecially sensitive to propagation effects arising in the interstellar medium.\nWe have made the most sensitive measurements of pulsar dispersion measures\n(DMs) and rotation measures (RMs), with median uncertainties of 2.9x10^-4 pc\ncm^-3 and 0.01 rad m^-2, respectively, and can track their variations over\nalmost a decade, along with other frequency-dependent effects. This allows\nstringent limits on average magnetic fields, with no variations detected above\n~20 nG. Finally, the census yields some interesting phenomena in individual\nsources, including the detection of frequency and time-dependent DM variations\nin B2217+47, and the detection of highly circularly polarized emission from\nJ0051+0423.",

We calculated the 1st- to 3rd-order\nVSFs and found that 60\\% of the VSFs exhibit power-law distributions. The\nrelative power-law exponents are consistent with predictions from intermittent\nturbulence models. Column density weighting reduces the proportion of power-law\nVSFs and steepens the VSF slopes, implying a reduction of turbulent energy in\nhigh-density regions. All clouds show small-scale intermittency, with slightly\nstronger intermittency in those molecular clouds showing none power-law VSFs.\nNegative VSF exponents that may indicate gravitational collapse are not\nobserved in our sample. The scaling exponents of the observed VSFs do not\ncorrelate with the virial parameters of the molecular clouds. These two\nobservations suggest that gravity-dominated scales in molecular clouds still\nneed further investigation. Consistent VSF scaling exponents for the molecular\nclouds with significant power-law VSFs suggest large-scale external driving of\nturbulence in these molecular clouds. However, the driving mechanisms are\nlikely not universal, as the power-law scaling coefficients in our results show\nrelatively large scatter.

    "abstract": "Coded caching is a promising technique to effectively reduce peak traffic by\nusing local caches and the multicast gains generated by these local caches. We\nprefer to design a coded caching scheme with the subpacketization $F$ and\ntransmission load $R$ as small as possible since these are the key metrics for\nevaluating the implementation complexity and transmission efficiency of the\nscheme, respectively. However, most of the existing coded caching schemes have\nlarge subpacketizations which grow exponentially with the number of users $K$,\nand there are a few schemes with linear subpacketizations which have large\ntransmission loads. In this paper, we focus on studying the linear\nsubpacketization, i.e., $K=F$, coded caching scheme with low transmission load.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a new combinatorial structure called\nnon-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP) which can be used to generate a coded\ncaching scheme with $K=F$. Then a class of new schemes is obtained by\nconstructing NHSDP. Theoretical and numerical comparisons show that (i)\ncompared to the existing schemes with linear subpacketization (to the number of\nusers), the proposed scheme achieves a lower load; (ii) compared to some\nexisting schemes with polynomial subpacketization, the proposed scheme can also\nachieve a lower load in some cases; (iii) compared to some existing schemes\nwith exponential subpacketization, the proposed scheme has loads close to those\nof these schemes in some cases. Moreover, the new concept of NHSDP is closely\nrelated to the classical combinatorial structures such as cyclic difference\npacking (CDP), non-three-term arithmetic progressions (NTAP), and perfect hash\nfamily (PHF). These connections indicate that NHSDP is an important\ncombinatorial structure in the field of combinatorial design.",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework, WaveNet-SF, to\nenhance retinal disease detection by integrating the spatial-domain and\nfrequency-domain learning. The framework utilizes wavelet transforms to\ndecompose OCT images into low- and high-frequency components, enabling the\nmodel to extract both global structural features and fine-grained details. To\nimprove lesion detection, we introduce a Multi-Scale Wavelet Spatial Attention\n(MSW-SA) module, which enhances the model's focus on regions of interest at\nmultiple scales. Additionally, a High-Frequency Feature Compensation (HFFC)\nblock is incorporated to recover edge information lost during wavelet\ndecomposition, suppress noise, and preserve fine details crucial for lesion\ndetection. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification\naccuracies of 97.82% and 99.58% on the OCT-C8 and OCT2017 datasets,\nrespectively, surpassing existing methods.

These technologies\ndemand robust and efficient sources of quantum light, as well as scalable,\nintegrable and multifunctional platforms. In this regard, quantum optical\nmetasurfaces (QOMs) are emerging as promising platforms for quantum light\ngeneration, namely biphotons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC),\nand its engineering. Due to the relaxation of phase matching, SPDC in QOMs\nallows different channels of biphoton generation, such as those supported by\noverlapping resonances, to occur simultaneously. In previously reported QOMs,\nhowever, SPDC was too weak to observe such effects. Here we develop QOMs based\non [110]-oriented GaAs that provide more than an order of magnitude enhancement\nin SPDC rate, after accounting for the spectral bandwidth, compared to any\nother QOMs studied to date. This boosted efficiency allows the QOMs support the\nsimultaneous generation of SPDC from several spectrally overlapping optical\nmodes. Using polarization components in the interferometer analyzer, we\nintentionally erase the distinguishability between the biphotons from a\nhigh-$Q$ quasi-bound-state-in-the-continuum resonance and a low-$Q$ Mie\nresonance, which results in the first-time observation of two-photon\ninterference in the spectral domain in these types of devices. This quantum\ninterference can considerably enrich the generation of entangled photons in\nmetasurfaces. Their advanced multifunctionality, improved nonlinear response,\nease of fabrication and compact footprint of [110]-GaAs QOMs position them as\npromising platforms to fulfill the requirements for photonic quantum\ntechnologies.",

Existing approaches for the\nidentification of such organized actions employ techniques mostly from network\nscience, graph machine learning and natural language processing. Their ultimate\ngoal is to analyze the relationships and interactions (e.g. re-posting) among\nusers and the textual similarities of their posts. Despite their effectiveness\nin recognizing astroturf campaigns, these methods face significant challenges,\nnotably the class imbalance in available training datasets. To mitigate this\nissue, recent methods usually resort to data augmentation or increasing the\nnumber of positive samples, which may not always be feasible or sufficient in\nreal-world settings. Following a different path, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel framework for identifying astroturf campaigns based solely on large\nlanguage models (LLMs), introducing a Balanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(Balanced RAG) component. Our approach first gives both textual information\nconcerning the posts (in our case tweets) and the user interactions of the\nsocial network as input to a language model. Then, through prompt engineering\nand the proposed Balanced RAG method, it effectively detects coordinated\ndisinformation campaigns on X (Twitter). The proposed framework does not\nrequire any training or fine-tuning of the language model. Instead, by\nstrategically harnessing the strengths of prompt engineering and Balanced RAG,\nit facilitates LLMs to overcome the effects of class imbalance and effectively\nidentify coordinated political campaigns.

    "abstract": "Recently, the practical needs of ``the right to be forgotten'' in federated\nlearning gave birth to a paradigm known as federated unlearning, which enables\nthe server to forget personal data upon the client's removal request. Existing\nstudies on federated unlearning have primarily focused on efficiently\neliminating the influence of requested data from the client's model without\nretraining from scratch, however, they have rarely doubted the reliability of\nthe global model posed by the discrepancy between its prediction performance\nbefore and after unlearning. To bridge this gap, we take the first step by\nintroducing a novel malicious unlearning attack dubbed FedMUA, aiming to unveil\npotential vulnerabilities emerging from federated learning during the\nunlearning process. The crux of FedMUA is to mislead the global model into\nunlearning more information associated with the influential samples for the\ntarget sample than anticipated, thus inducing adverse effects on target samples\nfrom other clients. To achieve this, we design a novel two-step method, known\nas Influential Sample Identification and Malicious Unlearning Generation, to\nidentify and subsequently generate malicious feature unlearning requests within\nthe influential samples. By doing so, we can significantly alter the\npredictions pertaining to the target sample by initiating the malicious feature\nunlearning requests, leading to the deliberate manipulation for the user\nadversely. Additionally, we design a new defense mechanism that is highly\nresilient against malicious unlearning attacks. Extensive experiments on three\nrealistic datasets reveal that FedMUA effectively induces misclassification on\ntarget samples and can achieve an 80% attack success rate by triggering only\n0.3% malicious unlearning requests.",

    "abstract": "Adiabatic control is a fundamental technique for manipulating quantum\nsystems, guided by the quantum adiabatic theorem, which ensures suppressed\nnonadiabatic transitions under slow parameter variations. Quantum annealing, a\nheuristic algorithm leveraging adiabatic control, seeks the ground states of\nIsing spin glass models and has drawn attention for addressing combinatorial\noptimization problems. However, exponentially small energy gaps in such models\noften necessitate impractically long runtime to satisfy the adiabatic\ncondition. Despite this limitation, improving the quality of approximate\nsolutions remains crucial for practical applications. The quantum adiabatic\nbrachistochrone provides a method to enhance adiabaticity by minimizing an\naction representing nonadiabaticity via the variational principle. While\neffective, its implementation requires detailed energy spectra, complicating\nits use in quantum annealing. Shortcuts to adiabaticity by counterdiabatic\ndriving offer alternative approaches for accelerating adiabatic processes.\nHowever, the theory of shortcuts to adiabaticity often faces challenges such as\nnonlocal control requirements, high computational cost, and trade-offs between\nspeed and energy efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel quantum adiabatic\nbrachistochrone protocol tailored for quantum annealing that eliminates the\nneed for energy spectrum information. Our approach builds on advancements in\ncounterdiabatic driving to design efficient parameter schedules. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method through numerical simulations on the\ntransverse-field Ising chain and axial next-nearest neighbor Ising models.",

In our new code PyEMILI, the major shortcomings in EMILI's\nline-identification technique have been amended. Moreover, the atomic\ntransition database utilized by PyEMILI was adopted from Atomic Line List\nv3.00b4 but greatly supplemented with theoretical transition data from the\nliterature. The effective recombination coefficients of the CII, OII, NII and\nNeII nebular lines are collected from the literature to form a subset of the\natomic transition database to aid identification of faint optical recombination\nlines in the spectra of PNe and HII regions. PyEMILI is tested using the deep,\nhigh-dispersion spectra of two Galactic PNe, Hf2-2 and IC418, and gives better\nresults of line identification than EMILI does. We also ran PyEMILI on the\noptical spectrum of a late-type [WC11] star UVQS J060819.93-715737.4 recently\ndiscovered in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and our results agree well with the\nprevious manual identifications.

In cognitive psychology, Mental Set refers to the tendency to persist\nwith previously successful strategies, even when they become inefficient - a\nchallenge for problem solving and reasoning.

To address this challenge, we introduce\na comprehensive framework to model and evaluate LLM episodic memory\ncapabilities.

Recent research emphasizes that a proficient XAI method should adhere\nto a set of criteria, primarily focusing on two key areas. Firstly, it should\nensure the quality and fluidity of explanations, encompassing aspects like\nfaithfulness, plausibility, completeness, and tailoring to individual needs.\nSecondly, the design principle of the XAI system or mechanism should cover the\nfollowing factors such as reliability, resilience, the verifiability of its\noutputs, and the transparency of its algorithm.

To deal with the endpoint\nsingularities that are prevalent for the next-to-leading power logarithms, we\nhave adopted two different kinds of regulators to exhibit the advantages and\ndisadvantages of each regulator. In the analytic regulator we have chosen, the\npower of the propagator is changed by $\\eta$. And the endpoint singularities\nare regulated in the form of $1/\\eta$. These poles cancel between the collinear\nand anti-collinear sectors since there is no soft mode in such a regulator. In\nthe $\\Delta$ regulator, the soft sector is important. The leading and\nnext-to-leading logarithms can be inferred from only this sector. Moreover, the\nsymmetry between the collinear and anti-collinear sectors is preserved.

This study\nevaluates the impact of the participation of eKVN in the EHT on the recovery of\nthe M87* jet. Synthetic data, derived from a simulated M87* model, were\nobserved using both the EHT and the combined EHT+eKVN arrays, followed by image\nreconstructions from both configurations. The results indicate that the\ninclusion of eKVN significantly improves the recovery of jet structures by\nreducing residual noise. Furthermore, jackknife tests, in which one or two EHT\ntelescopes were omitted - simulating potential data loss due to poor weather -\ndemonstrate that eKVN effectively compensates for these missing telescopes,\nparticularly in short baseline coverage. Multi-frequency synthesis imaging at\n86-230 GHz shows that the EHT+eKVN array enhances the recovered spectral index\ndistribution compared to the EHT alone and improves image reconstruction at\neach frequency over single-frequency imaging. As the EHT continues to expand\nits array configuration and observing capabilities to probe black hole physics\nmore in depth, the integration of eKVN into the EHT will significantly enhance\nthe stability of observational results and improve image fidelity.

The performance of these controllers was evaluated\nusing MATLAB simulations, characterized by overshoot, settling time,\nsteady-state error, rise time, and peak time. The results indicate that the\nstate-feedback controller with integral action (SFCIA) surpasses other control\nstrategies by achieving zero steady-state error, minimal overshoot, the\nshortest settling time, and optimized rise and peak times.

As a generalization of undirected methods, MagDG shows\nsuperior capability in modeling intricate web-scale topology.

This parameter tuning, driven by downstream tasks, limits model\nflexibility and significantly increases manual effort. (2) Coarse Message\nPassing: Most approaches treat all nodes with the same complex-domain\npropagation and aggregation rules, neglecting their unique digraph contexts.\nThis oversight results in sub-optimal performance. To address the above issues,\nwe propose two key techniques: (1) MAP is crafted to be a plug-and-play\ncomplex-domain propagation optimization strategy in the context of digraph\nlearning, enabling seamless integration into any MagDG to improve predictions\nwhile enjoying high running efficiency.

However, this paper\nreveals a significant and previously unrecognized ethical risk inherent in this\ntechnology and introduces a novel method, termed the Cognitive Morphing Attack\n(CogMorph), which manipulates T2I models to generate images that retain the\noriginal core subjects but embeds toxic or harmful contextual elements. This\nnuanced manipulation exploits the cognitive principle that human perception of\nconcepts is shaped by the entire visual scene and its context, producing images\nthat amplify emotional harm far beyond attacks that merely preserve the\noriginal semantics. To address this, we first construct an imagery toxicity\ntaxonomy spanning 10 major and 48 sub-categories, aligned with human\ncognitive-perceptual dimensions, and further build a toxicity risk matrix\nresulting in 1,176 high-quality T2I toxic prompts. Based on this, our CogMorph\nfirst introduces Cognitive Toxicity Augmentation, which develops a cognitive\ntoxicity knowledge base with rich external toxic representations for humans\n(e.g., fine-grained visual features) that can be utilized to further guide the\noptimization of adversarial prompts. In addition, we present Contextual\nHierarchical Morphing, which hierarchically extracts critical parts of the\noriginal prompt (e.g., scenes, subjects, and body parts), and then iteratively\nretrieves and fuses toxic features to inject harmful contexts. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple open-sourced T2I models and black-box commercial APIs\n(e.g., DALLE-3) demonstrate the efficacy of CogMorph which significantly\noutperforms other baselines by large margins (+20.62% on average).",

Specifically, we\nfocus on distribution estimation as a central objective guiding analyst's\nqueries. The problem is addressed within a non-parametric Bayesian framework,\ncapturing the flexibility and dynamic evolution of analyst's beliefs. Our\nhierarchical approach leverages P\\'olya trees (PTs) as priors over the\ndistribution space, facilitating the adaptive selection of counting queries to\nefficiently reduce the estimation error without increasing the number of\nqueries. Furthermore, with its interpretability and conjugacy, the proposed\nframework allows for intuitive conversion of subjective beliefs into objective\npriors and their effortless updates to posteriors. Using theoretical\nderivations, we formalize the PT-based solution as a computational algorithm.\nSimulations further demonstrate its effectiveness in distribution estimation\ntasks compared to the non-adaptive approach. By aligning with real-world\napplications, this structured ADA framework fosters opportunities for\ncollaborative research in related areas, such as human-in-the-loop systems and\ncognitive studies of belief updating.",

    "abstract": "Radiotherapy (RT) planning is complex, subjective, and time-intensive.\nAdvances with artificial intelligence (AI) promise to improve its precision and\nefficiency, but progress is often limited by the scarcity of large,\nstandardized datasets. To address this, we introduce the Automated Iterative RT\nPlanning (AIRTP) system, a scalable solution for generating high-quality\ntreatment plans. This scalable solution is designed to generate substantial\nvolumes of consistently high-quality treatment plans, overcoming a key obstacle\nin the advancement of AI-driven RT planning. Our AIRTP pipeline adheres to\nclinical guidelines and automates essential steps, including organ-at-risk\n(OAR) contouring, helper structure creation, beam setup, optimization, and plan\nquality improvement, using AI integrated with RT planning software like Varian\nEclipse. Furthermore, a novel approach for determining optimization parameters\nto reproduce 3D dose distributions, i.e. a method to convert dose predictions\nto deliverable treatment plans constrained by machine limitations is proposed.\nA comparative analysis of plan quality reveals that our automated pipeline\nproduces treatment plans of quality comparable to those generated manually,\nwhich traditionally require several hours of labor per plan. Committed to\npublic research, the first data release of our AIRTP pipeline includes nine\ncohorts covering head-and-neck and lung cancer sites to support an AAPM 2025\nchallenge.

For molecular plasmonic\nexcitation, the conjugated structure can influence the oscillation modes of\nvalence electrons, which is pivotal in yielding distinct field enhancement\ncharacteristics. Furthermore, charge doping can lead to a certain degree of\nalteration in the conjugated structures, and the doping of elements will result\nin varying degrees of such alteration, thereby initiating different trends in\nthe evolution of plasmonic resonance. This further enhances the tunability of\nmolecular plasmonic resonance.

    "abstract": "Table Structure Recognition (TSR) is a task aimed at converting table images\ninto a machine-readable format (e.g. HTML), to facilitate other applications\nsuch as information retrieval. Recent works tackle this problem by identifying\nthe HTML tags and text regions, where the latter is used for text extraction\nfrom the table document. These works however, suffer from misalignment issues\nwhen mapping text into the identified text regions. In this paper, we introduce\na new TSR framework, called TFLOP (TSR Framework with LayOut Pointer\nmechanism), which reformulates the conventional text region prediction and\nmatching into a direct text region pointing problem. Specifically, TFLOP\nutilizes text region information to identify both the table's structure tags\nand its aligned text regions, simultaneously. Without the need for region\nprediction and alignment, TFLOP circumvents the additional text region matching\nstage, which requires finely-calibrated post-processing. TFLOP also employs\nspan-aware contrastive supervision to enhance the pointing mechanism in tables\nwith complex structure. As a result, TFLOP achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple benchmarks such as PubTabNet, FinTabNet, and\nSynthTabNet.

    "abstract": "In a multi-agent system, one may choose to govern the behaviour of an agent\nby imposing norms, which act as guidelines for how agents should act either all\nof the time or in given situations. However, imposing multiple norms on one or\nmore agents may result in situations where these norms conflict over how the\nagent should behave. In any system with normative conflicts (such as safe\nreinforcement models or systems which monitor safety protocols), one must\ndecide which norms should be followed such that the most important and most\nrelevant norms are maintained. We introduce a new method for resolving\nnormative conflicts through argumentation and graph colouring which is\ncompatible with a variety of normative conflict resolution policies. We prove\nthat this method always creates an admissible set of arguments under\nargumentation semantics, meaning that it produces coherent outputs. We also\nintroduce more robust variants of this method, each building upon their\npredecessor to create a superior output, and we include further mathematical\nproof of their coherence. Our most advanced variant uses the existing concept\nof curtailment, where one norm may supersede another without fully eliminating\nit.

Our method\naims to improve procedural guidance by overcoming the limitations of\ntraditional two-dimensional imaging techniques. This study employed three 3D\ngeometries of ICA aneurysms to simulate virtual angiograms. These angiograms\nwere generated using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver, followed by\nthe simulation of biplane angiography using a cone-beam geometry.\nSelf-calibration was accomplished by matching contrast media position as a\nfunction of time between biplane views. Feature-matching was used to\ntriangulate and reconstruct vascular structures in 3D. The projection data was\nutilized to refine the 3D estimation, including elimination of erroneous\nstructures and ellipse-fitting. The accuracy of the reconstructions was\nevaluated using the Dice-Sorensen coefficient, comparing the 3D reconstructions\nto the original models. The proposed epipolar reconstruction method generalized\nwell across the three tested aneurysm models, with respective Dice-Sorensen\ncoefficients of 0.745, 0.759, and 0.654. Errors were primarily due to partial\nvessel overlap. The average reconstruction time for all three volumes was\napproximately 10 seconds.
