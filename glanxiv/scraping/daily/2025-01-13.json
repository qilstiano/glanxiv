RbRL, a method based on the idea\nof human ratings, has been developed to infer reward functions in reward-free\nenvironments for the subsequent policy learning via standard reinforcement\nlearning, which requires the availability of reward functions. Specifically,\nRbRL minimizes the cross entropy loss that quantifies the differences between\nhuman ratings and estimated ratings derived from the inferred reward. Hence, a\nlow loss means a high degree of consistency between human ratings and estimated\nratings. Despite its simple form, RbRL has various hyperparameters and can be\nsensitive to various factors. Therefore, it is critical to provide\ncomprehensive experiments to understand the impact of various hyperparameters\non the performance of RbRL.

But establishing rigorously that\ncorrelation functions, say of the spin, expand diffusively, remains one of the\nmost important problems of mathematical physics. We establish for the first\ntime, with Lindbladian evolution, a lower bound on spin diffusion in chaotic,\ntranslation-invariant, nearest-neighbor open quantum spin-1/2 chain satisfying\na local detailed-balance condition and strong conservation of magnetisation.\nThe bound is strictly positive if and only if the local quantum jumps transport\nspin. Physically, the bound comes from the spreading effects of initial-state\nmacroscopic fluctuations, a mechanism which occurs whenever spin is an\ninteracting ballistic mode. Chaoticity means that the Hilbert space of\nextensive charges is spanned by magnetisation; we expect this to be generic.\nOur main tool is the Green-Kubo formula, the mathematical technique of\nprojection over quadratically extensive charges, and appropriate correlation\ndecay bounds recently established. Because Lindbladian dynamics is not\nreversible, the Green-Kubo spin diffusion strength includes a contribution due\nto irreversibility, which we interpret as encoding the hydrodynamic entropy\nproduction that may occur in the forgotten environment. This, we show, vanishes\nfor certain choices of interaction parameters, for which the Lindbladian\ndynamics becomes reversible. Our methods can be extended to finite or short\nranges, higher spins, and other non-Hamiltonian systems such as quantum\ncircuits. As we argue, according to the theory of nonlinear fluctuating\nhydrodynamics, we further expect these systems to display superdiffusion, and\nthus have infinite diffusivity; however this is still beyond the reach of\nmathematical rigour.",

    "abstract": "We show via a combination of mathematical arguments and empirical evidence\nthat data distributions sampled from diffusion models satisfy a Concentration\nof Measure Property saying that any Lipschitz $1$-dimensional projection of a\nrandom vector is not too far from its mean with high probability. This implies\nthat such models are quite restrictive and gives an explanation for a fact\npreviously observed in the literature that conventional diffusion models cannot\ncapture \"heavy-tailed\" data (i.e. data $\\mathbf{x}$ for which the norm\n$\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2$ does not possess a sub-Gaussian tail) well. We then proceed\nto train a generalized linear model using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on\nthe diffusion-generated data for a multiclass classification task and observe\nempirically that a Gaussian universality result holds for the test error.\n  In other words, the test error depends only on the first and second order\nstatistics of the diffusion-generated data in the linear setting. Results of\nsuch forms are desirable because they allow one to assume the data itself is\nGaussian for analyzing performance of the trained classifier. Finally, we note\nthat current approaches to proving universality do not apply to this case as\nthe covariance matrices of the data tend to have vanishing minimum singular\nvalues for the diffusion-generated data, while the current proofs assume that\nthis is not the case (see Subsection 3.4 for more details). This leaves\nextending previous mathematical universality results as an intriguing open\nquestion.",

One key question is how more than $M+1$ phases, as\nwould normally be allowed by Gibbs' phase rule at generic temperature in a\nmixture of $M$ molecular species, can be made to coexist in equilibrium. In the\ngrandcanonical ensemble, such super-Gibbs phase equilibria can be realized by\ntuning the interactions among the $M$ species. This introduces $\\sim M^2$\nadditional degrees of freedom and hence a superlinear number of phases that can\ncoexist. We show that, surprisingly, there is no straightforward equivalence to\nthe situation in the experimentally relevant canonical ensemble: here only a\nsubset of the grandcanonical phases will generically be realized.

    "abstract": "Interpretability work on the convolutional layers of CNNs has primarily\nfocused on computer vision, but some studies also explore correspondences\nbetween the latent space and the output in the audio domain. However, it has\nnot been thoroughly examined how acoustic and linguistic information is\nrepresented in the fully connected (FC) layer that bridges the latent space and\nconvolutional layers. The current study presents the first exploration of how\nthe FC layer of CNNs for speech synthesis encodes linguistically relevant\ninformation. We propose two techniques for exploration of the fully connected\nlayer. In Experiment 1, we use weight matrices as inputs into convolutional\nlayers. In Experiment 2, we manipulate the FC layer to explore how\nsymbolic-like representations are encoded in CNNs. We leverage the fact that\nthe FC layer outputs a feature map and that variable-specific weight matrices\nare temporally structured to (1) demonstrate how the distribution of learned\nweights varies between latent variables in systematic ways and (2) demonstrate\nhow manipulating the FC layer while holding constant subsequent model\nparameters affects the output. We ultimately present an FC manipulation that\ncan output a single segment. Using this technique, we show that lexically\nspecific latent codes in generative CNNs (ciwGAN) have shared lexically\ninvariant sublexical representations in the FC-layer weights, showing that\nciwGAN encodes lexical information in a linguistically principled manner.",

However, the incorporation of\nthis model into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system setups, relying on\nthe recent paradigm-shifting transceiver architecture based on stacked\nintelligent metasurfaces (SIM), in an environment with reconfigurable\nintelligent surfaces (RISs) remains an open problem due to the many intricate\ndetails that have to be accounted for. In this paper, we fill this gap by\nintroducing a novel DD MIMO channel model that incorporates an arbitrary number\nof RISs in the ambient, as well as SIMs equipping both the transmitter and\nreceiver. We then discuss how the proposed metasurfaces-parametrized DD (MPDD)\nchannel model can be seamlessly applied to waveforms that are known to perform\nwell in DD environments, namely, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\n(OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division\nmultiplexing (AFDM), with each having their own inherent advantages and\ndisadvantages. An illustrative application of the programmable functionality of\nthe proposed model is finally presented to showcase its potential for boosting\nthe performance of the aforementioned waveforms.

    "abstract": "Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a critical technology in the evolution of\nself-driving cars toward complete artificial intelligence. Over recent years,\nfocusing on the trajectories of pedestrians to model their social interactions\nhas surged with great interest in more accurate trajectory predictions.\nHowever, existing methods for modeling pedestrian social interactions rely on\npre-defined rules, struggling to capture non-explicit social interactions. In\nthis work, we propose a novel framework named DTGAN, which extends the\napplication of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to graph sequence data,\nwith the primary objective of automatically capturing implicit social\ninteractions and achieving precise predictions of pedestrian trajectory. DTGAN\ninnovatively incorporates random weights within each graph to eliminate the\nneed for pre-defined interaction rules. We further enhance the performance of\nDTGAN by exploring diverse task loss functions during adversarial training,\nwhich yields improvements of 16.7\\% and 39.3\\% on metrics ADE and FDE,\nrespectively. The effectiveness and accuracy of our framework are verified on\ntwo public datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed DTGAN\nachieves superior performance and is well able to understand pedestrians'\nintentions.",

Many applications,\nincluding simplifications and generalizations of previously known results on\nsymbolic powers and integral closures of powers of homogeneous ideals, are\ndiscussed. We provide a combinatorial interpretation of the limit $\\lim_{n\n\\rightarrow \\infty} \\text{reg } I_n/n$ in terms of the associated\nNewton--Okounkov region in various situations.

Spiegel and Zahn (1992) proposed the first\nhydrodynamical model, which here we call SZ92, arguing that the tachocline is\nessentially in a steady state of thermal-wind balance, angular-momentum\nbalance, and thermal equilibrium. Angular momentum transport in their model is\nassumed to be dominated by strongly anisotropic turbulence, primarily\nhorizontal owing to the strong stable stratification of the radiative interior.\nBy contrast, the heat transport is assumed to be dominated by a predominantly\nvertical diffusive heat flux owing to the thinness of the tachocline. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that these assumptions are not consistent with the new\nmodel of stratified turbulence recently proposed by Chini et al. (2022) and\nShah et al. (2024), which has been numerically validated by Garaud et al.\n(2024). We then propose a simple self-consistent alternative to the SZ92 model,\nnamely, a scenario wherein angular momentum and heat transport are both\ndominated by horizontal turbulent diffusion. The thickness of the tachocline in\nthe new model scales as $\\Omega_\\odot / N_m$, where $\\Omega_\\odot$ is the mean\nangular velocity of the Sun, and $N_m$ the buoyancy frequency in the tachocline\nregion. We discuss other properties of the model, and show that it has several\ndesirable features, but does not resolve some of the other well-known problems\nof the SZ92 model.",

We find the\nsequence of optical ejecta brightening and the appearance of new optical ejecta\nindicating the advancement of the remnant's reverse shock in the remnant's main\nshell has velocities typically between 1000 and 2000 km/s, which is ~1000 km/s\nless than recent measurements made in X-rays.

However, we do not find the reverse shock to\nmove inward at velocities as large as ~2000 km/s as has been reported. Optical\nejecta in Cas A's main emission shell have proper motions indicating outward\ntangential motions ~3500 - 6000 km/s, with the smaller values preferentially\nalong the remnant's southern regions which we speculate may be partially the\ncause of the remnant's faint and more slowly evolving southern sections.\nFollowing interaction with the reverse shock, ejecta knots exhibit extended\nmass ablated trails 0.2\" - 0.5\" in length leading to extended emission\nindicating reverse shock induced decelerated velocities as large as 1000 km/s.\nSuch ablated material is most prominently seen in higher ionization line\nemissions, whereas denser parts of ejecta knots show surprisingly little\ndeceleration.",

This is the case of a\nmuch-studied process such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process where, recently,\nanomalous dynamical scaling of large deviations of time integrated functionals\nhas been highlighted. Using the mapping of a continuous stochastic process to a\ncontinuous time random walk via the \"excursions technique'', we introduce a\ncomprehensive formalism that enables the calculation of the complete\ndistribution of the time-integrated observable $A = \\int_0^T v^n(t) dt$, where\n$n$ is a positive integer and $v(t)$ is the random velocity of a particle\nfollowing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics. We reveal an interesting connection\nbetween the anomalous rate function associated with the observable $A$ and the\nstatistics of the area under the first-passage functional during an excursion.\nThe rate function of the latter, analyzed here for the first time, exhibits\nanomalous scaling behavior and a dynamical phase transition, both of which are\nexplored in detail. The case of the anomalous scaling of large deviations,\noriginally associated to the presence of an instantonic solution in the weak\nnoise regime of a path integral approach, is here produced by a so called \"big\njump effect'', in which the contribution to rare events is dominated by the\nlargest excursion. Our approach, which is quite general for continuous\nstochastic processes, allows to associate a physical meaning to the anomalous\nscaling of large deviations, through the big jump principle.",

Utilizing CAPO as the fundamental component, we\ndevelop the Pixelwise Cross Gradient Deformation (PCGD), which is capable of\nemulating operations on ideal plastic objects (without volume constraint).\nNotably, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four\nwidely adopted benchmarks for GDSR, with significant advantages in large-scale\ntasks and generalizability.",

In particular, we link\nexisting disentangled dataset distillation methods to the classical optimal\nquantization and Wasserstein barycenter problems, demonstrating consistency of\ndistilled datasets for diffusion-based generative priors. We propose Dataset\nDistillation by Optimal Quantization, based on clustering in a latent space.\nCompared to the previous SOTA method D\\textsuperscript{4}M, we achieve better\nperformance and inter-model generalization on the ImageNet-1K dataset with\ntrivial additional computation, and SOTA performance in higher image-per-class\nsettings. Using the distilled noise initializations in a stronger diffusion\ntransformer model, we obtain SOTA distillation performance on ImageNet-1K and\nits subsets, outperforming diffusion guidance methods.",

This limitation calls for constructing\ncompositional query representations that encapsulate logical operations or\nnegations, and can be used to match relevant documents effectively. In the\nfirst part of this work, we explore constructing such representations in a\nzero-shot setting using vector operations between lexically grounded Learned\nSparse Retrieval (LSR) representations. Specifically, we introduce Disentangled\nNegation that penalizes only the negated parts of a query, and a Combined\nPseudo-Term approach that enhances LSRs ability to handle intersections. We\nfind that our zero-shot approach is competitive and often outperforms\nretrievers fine-tuned on compositional data, highlighting certain limitations\nof LSR and Dense Retrievers.

These models follow the evolution of galaxies based on the halo assembly\nhistories inferred from large $N$-body cosmological simulations. This process\nrequires codes to identify halos (\"halo finder\") and to track their time\nevolution (\"tree builder\"). While these codes generally perform well, they\nencounter numerical issues when handling dense environments. In this paper, we\npresent how relevant these issues are in state-of-the-art cosmological\nsimulations. We characterize two major numerical artefacts in halo assembly\nhistories: (i) the non-physical swapping of large amounts of mass between\nsubhalos, and (ii) the sudden formation of already massive subhalos at late\ncosmic times. We quantify these artefacts for different combinations of halo\nfinder (SUBFIND, VELOCIRAPTOR, HBT-HERONS) and tree builder codes\n(D-TRESS+DHALO, TREEFROG, HBT-HERONS), finding that in general more than $50\\%$\n($80\\%$) of the more massive subhalos with $>10^{3}$ ($>10^{4}$) particles at\n$z=0$ inherit them in most cases. However, HBT-HERONS, which explicitly\nincorporates temporal information, effectively reduces the occurrence of these\nartefacts to $5\\%$ ($10\\%$). We then use the semi-analytic models SHARK and\nGALFORM to explore how these artefacts impact galaxy formation predictions. We\ndemonstrate that the issues above lead to non-physical predictions in galaxies\nhosted by affected halos, particularly in SHARK where the modelling of baryons\nrelies on subhalo information. Finally, we propose and implement fixes for the\nnumerical artefacts at the semi-analytic model level, and use SHARK to show the\nimprovements, especially at the high-mass end, after applying them.",

We demonstrate that while a light non-compact scalar predicts\na bispectrum of the so-called local shape, the light compact scalar predicts a\nqualitatively different shape characterised by the ratio of the Hubble scale to\nits field-space circumference.

The HiPO data\nformat has features that are suited for storing raw detector data,\nreconstruction data, and the final physics analysis data efficiently,\neliminating the need to do data conversions through the lifecycle of\nexperimental data. The HiPO data format is implemented in C++ and JAVA, and\nprovides bindings to FORTRAN, Python, and Julia, providing users with the\nchoice of data analysis frameworks to use. In this paper, we will present the\ngeneral design and functionalities of the HiPO library and compare the\nperformance of the library with more established data formats used in data\nanalysis in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (such as ROOT and Parquete).",

In the 1980s, within the\nframework of research into mathematical models on the parallel processing of\nneural systems, a group of operators emerged -- neurally inspired and based on\nmatrix algebra -- which computed logical operations automatically. These matrix\noperators reproduce the order of operators and variables of Polish notation.\nThese logical matrices can also generate a three-valued logic with broad\nsimilarities to Lukasiewicz's three-valued logic. In this paper, a parallel is\ndrawn between relevant formulas represented in Polish notation, and their\ncounterparts in terms of neurally based matrix operators. Lukasiewicz's\nthree-valued logic, shown in Polish notation has several points of contact with\nwhat matrices produce when they process uncertain truth vectors.

Although compact\nsemiconductor lasers with narrow linewidths and low noise have been\ndemonstrated, their spectral purity typically relies on hybrid or heterogeneous\nexternal cavity feedback. Here, we present a theoretical and experimental\ndemonstration of a heterogeneous free optical injection locking (HF OIL)\nsemiconductor laser. By integrating a topological interface state extended\n(TISE) laser with a micro ring resonator (MRR) on an AlGaInAs multiple quantum\nwell platform,we achieve monolithic photon injection and phase locking, thereby\nreducing the optical linewidth. We fabricated and characterized a 1550 nm\nsidewall HF OIL laser, achieving stable single mode operation over a broad\ncurrent range (65 to 300 mA) and a side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) over 50\ndB. Under injection locking, the devices Voigt fitted linewidth narrowed from\nover 1.7 MHz (free running) to 4.2 kHz, representing a three order of magnitude\nimprovement over conventional distributed feedback lasers. The intrinsic\nlinewidth of 1.4 kHz is measured by correlated delayed self-heterodyne\nfrequency noise power spectrum density (FN PSD) method. Moreover, the HF OIL\nlaser demonstrated high phase stability and the ability to transition from a\nrandom phased to a phase locked state. These results underscore the potential\nof HF-OIL lasers in advancing coherent optical communications and phase\nencoders in quantum key distribution (QKD) systems.",

Using dynamic biocompatible scaffolds that can self-alter their\nproperties via crosslinking and motor-driven force-generation opens even\ngreater avenues for actuation and control. However, the design principles\nassociated with engineering active scaffolds embedded with cells are not well\nestablished. To address this challenge, we design a dynamic scaffold material\nof bacteria cells embedded within a composite cytoskeletal network of actin and\nmicrotubules that can be passively or actively crosslinked by either\nbiotin-streptavidin or multimeric kinesin motors. Using quantitative\nmicroscopy, we demonstrate the ability to embed cells of volume fractions 0.4\nto 2% throughout the network without compromising the structural integrity of\nthe network or inhibiting crosslinking or motor-driven dynamics. Our findings\nsuggest that both passive and active crosslinking promote entrainment of cells\nwithin the network, while depletion interactions play a more important role in\nuncrosslinked networks. Moreover, we show that large-scale structures emerge\nwith the addition of cell fractions as low as 0.4%, but these structures do not\ninfluence the microscale structural lengthscale of the materials.

Nebular spectra, namely mid-infrared (MIR) with JWST are\nan effective tool to probe for the multi-dimensional imprints of the explosion\nphysics of WDs and their progenitor systems but also pose a challenge for\nsimulations. What we observe as SNe Ia are low-energy photons, namely light\ncurves, and spectra detected some days to years after the explosion. The light\nis emitted from a rapidly expanding envelope consisting of a low-density and\nlow-temperature plasma with atomic population numbers far from thermodynamical\nequilibrium. SNe Ia are powered radioactive decays which produce hard X- and\ngamma-rays and MeV leptons which are converted within the ejecta to low-energy\nphotons. We find that the optical and IR nebular spectra depend sensitively on\nthe proper treatment of the physical conversion of high to low energies. The\nlow-energy photons produced by forbidden line transitions originate from a\nmostly optically thin envelope. However, the UV is optically thick because of a\nquasi-continuum formed by allowed lines and bound-free transitions even several\nyears after the explosion. We find that stimulated recombination limits the\nover-ionization of high ions with populations governed by the far UV. The\nrequirements to simulate nebular spectra are well beyond both classical stellar\natmospheres and nebulae. Using our full non-LTE HYDrodynamical RAdiation code\n(HYDRA) as a test-bed, the sensitivity on the physics on synthetic spectra are\ndemonstrated using observations as a benchmark.

By giving domain experts the opportunity to inspect\nthe LLM-generated logic program, and making modifications when needed, our CDSS\nensures that the diagnosis is not only accurate but also interpretable. We\nexperimentally compare it with two baseline approaches of using LLMs:\ndiagnosing patients using the LLM-only approach, and using the LLM-generated\nlogic program but without expert inspection. The results show that, while LLMs\nare extremely useful in generating candidate logic programs, these programs\nstill require expert inspection and modification to guarantee faithfulness to\nthe official diagnostic manuals.

We discover a\nset of three discontinuities within <500 kpc of the cluster center, and, from a\nsurface brightness analysis, place $5\\sigma$ upper limits of $M_{NE}<1.43$ and\n$M_{SW}<1.57$ for any shock associated with the relic locations. We also revise\nestablished scaling relations for double radio-relics by adding 12 new systems\nnot included in previous work. The PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 relics have the widest\nseparation (scaled for $r_{500}$) of all known double-relic systems. The\nexceptional distance from the cluster center ($>r_{200}$), indicates the relics\nmay be associated with shocks in the ``run-away\" phase. We propose that this\nlate-stage, post-apocenter merger is captured as the two subclusters with a\nmass ratio of 1.2-1.4 fall back into each other. The outer relic shocks were\nlikely produced at the first core passage, while the inner discontinuities are\nassociated with the second infall.",

    "abstract": "Implicit Error Correction (IEC) is a near Video-on-Demand (nVoD) scheme that\ntrades bandwidth utilization for initial playback delay to potentially support\nan infinite number of users. Additionally, it provides error protection without\nany further bandwidth increase by exploiting the implicit redundancy of nVoD\nprotocols, using linear combinations of the segments transmitted in a given\ntime slot. However, IEC packet loss protection is weaker at the beginning of\nthe playback due to the lack of implicit redundancy and lower decoding\nefficiency, resulting in worse subjective playback quality. In tackling this\nissue, this paper contributes with an extension of the original nVoD\narchitecture, enhancing its performance by adding a new element namely,\nsubchannels. These subdivisions of the original channels do not provide further\npacket loss protection but significantly improve the decoding efficiency, which\nin turn increases playback quality, especially at the beginning. Even for very\nhigh packet loss probabilities, subchannels are designed to obtain higher\ndecoding efficiency which results in greater packet loss protection than that\nprovided by IEC. The proposed scheme is especially useful in wireless\ncooperative networks using techniques such as network coding, as content\ntransmissions can be split into different subchannels in order to maximize\nnetwork efficiency.",

While the\nzero-divisor conjecture still remains open, the unit conjecture was disproven\nby Gardam in 2021.

The table includes an entry for an interval based on the central\nlimit theorem using Gaussian quantiles and the Gaussian maximum likelihood\nvariance estimate. It is missing an entry for the very widely used Student's\n$t$ confidence intervals. This note develops such a formula. The impetus to\nrevisit this issue arose from the surprisingly robust performance of confidence\nintervals based on Student's t statistic in randomized quasi-Monte Carlo\nsampling. Hall's table had $0.14\\kappa -2.12\\gamma^2-3.35$ for normal theory\nintervals; the corresponding entry for Student's $t$ is $0.14\\kappa\n-2.12\\gamma^2$.\n  An earlier version of this note reported that it corrected some coverage\nerror formulas in Hall (1988). Two-sided errors take the form\n$2\\Phi^{-1}(0.975)(A\\kappa + \\gamma^2+C)\\varphi(1.96)/n +O(1/n^{3/2})$ where\nthe error may well be $O(n^{-2})$.

This is accomplished by\nsmearing or averaging over all input events that lie within a prescribed metric\nenergy distance of one another and correspondingly renders any quantity\nmeasured on a finite, discrete dataset continuous over the dataspace. Within\nthis approach, we are able to explicitly demonstrate that (approximate) scaling\nlaws are a consequence of extreme value theory applied to analysis of the\ndistribution of the irreducible minimal distance over which a machine must\nextrapolate given a finite dataset.

In this paper, we propose a novel perspective that any language\ndataset can be represented by a Monte Carlo Language Tree (abbreviated as\n``Data-Tree''), where each node denotes a token, each edge denotes a token\ntransition probability, and each sequence has a unique path. Any GPT-like\nlanguage model can also be flattened into another Monte Carlo Language Tree\n(abbreviated as ``GPT-Tree'').

    "abstract": "Our current knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of galaxy clusters\ncomes primarily from detailed studies of clusters selected by their minority\ncomponents: hot baryons. Most of these studies select the clusters using the\ncomponent that is being investigated, the intracluster medium (ICM), making the\nsample choice prone to selection effects. Weak-gravitational lensing allows us\nto select clusters by the total mass component and, being independent of the\ntype of matter, makes the sample choice unbiased with respect to the baryon\ncontent. In this paper, we study four galaxy clusters at intermediate redshift\n($0.25<z<0.61$), selected from the weak-lensing survey of Miyazaki et al.\n(2018). We derive core-excised X-ray luminosities, richness-based masses,\nCompton parameters, and profiles of mass, pressure and electron densities.\nThese quantities are derived from shear data, Compton maps, and our own X-ray\nand SZ follow-up. When compared to ICM-selected clusters of the same mass, in\nthe range $2$ to $5 \\ 10^{14}$ M$_\\odot$, our small sample of four clusters is\nexpected to have on average 0.2 rare ($>2\\sigma$) features, while we observed\non average two rare features in each one of the seven explored properties:\nrichness, core-excised luminosity, Compton parameter, pressure and electron\npressure profiles, and central values of them. The abundance of rare and unique\nfeatures in such a small sample indicates a fundamental bias in our knowledge\nof the thermodynamic properties of clusters when derived from ICM-selected\nsamples.",

However, past studies either have been biased by the use of\noptically-thick lines or have been limited within the solar neighborhood and\nthe inner Galaxy (Galactocentric radius $R_{\\rm gc}<R_{\\rm gc,\\odot} \\approx 8$\nkpc). Here we present sensitive mapping observations of optically thin\n$^{13}$CO lines towards molecular clouds in the low-metallicity Galactic outer\ndisk ($R_{\\rm gc}\\sim9-24$ kpc). By combining archival data from the inner\nGalaxy and four nearby metal-poor dwarf galaxies, we reveal a systematic trend\nof $\\alpha_{\\rm vir}$, which declines from supervirial dynamic states in\nmetal-rich clouds to extremely subvirial dynamic states in metal-poor clouds.\nIn these metal-poor environments, turbulence alone is insufficient to\ncounterbalance the self-gravity of a cloud. A cloud-volumetric magnetic field\nmay replace turbulence as the dominant cloud-supporting mechanism in\nlow-metallicity conditions, for example, the outermost galactic disks, dwarf\ngalaxies and galaxies in the early Universe, which would then inevitably impact\nthe initial conditions for star formation in such environments.",

The former has been found to\ninduce anisotropic turbulence that is stronger in the vertical than in the\nradial dimension and to be overall stronger compared to the largely isotropic\nturbulence caused by the streaming instability. In this study, we shed light on\nthe dust diffusion by the vertical shear instability and the streaming\ninstability separately and together, and in particular on the direction- and\nscale-dependence of the diffusion. To this end, we employ two-dimensional\nglobal models of the two instabilities either in isolation or in combination.\nThe vertical shear instability in isolation diffuses dust more strongly in the\nvertical direction than the streaming instability in isolation, resulting in a\nwave-shaped dust layer in our two-dimensional simulations. Compared with this\nlarge-scale diffusion, though, our study highlights that the vertical shear\ninstability causes substantially weaker or even negligible small-scale\ndiffusion. We validate this result using previously published three-dimensional\nsimulations. In particular when simulating centimetre-sized dust, the\nundulating dust layer becomes internally razor-thin. In contrast, the diffusion\nowing to the streaming instability exhibits only a marginal scale-dependence,\nwith the dust layer possessing a Gaussian shape. In models including both\ninstabilities, the undulating mid-plane layer is broadened to a width set by\nthe intrinsic diffusion level caused by the streaming instability.",

By modelling the radio flux density\ndistribution of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars from the LOFAR\nTwo-metre Sky Survey Data Release 2, we find no correlation between\n$M_\\mathrm{BH}$ and SF rate (SFR) at any mass for quasars at a given redshift\nand bolometric luminosity.

We suggest defining radio\nquasar populations by their AGN and SF contributions instead of radio loudness;\nour new definition unifies previously divergent observational results on the\nrole of $M_\\mathrm{BH}$ in quasar radio emissions.

We present high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations, using adaptive mesh refinement to capture detailed disc dynamics\ndown to sub-AU scales. Starting from initial conditions derived from a\nmolecular cloud simulation, we model the collapse of a dense core into a\nprotostellar disc over 10,000 yr following sink particle (star) formation,\nachieving a maximum effective resolution of 0.63 AU. This simulation traces the\nevolution of the disc density, accretion rates, turbulence, and magnetic field\nstructures. We find that the protostellar disc grows to a diameter of\napproximately 100 AU, with mass accretion occurring in episodic bursts\ninfluenced by the turbulence of the core from which the disc builds up. The\ndisc is highly turbulent with a sonic Mach number of $\\sim2$. Episodic\naccretion events within the disc cause intermittent increases in mass and\nmagnetic energy density, resulting in an equipartition of the thermal and\nmagnetic pressure, i.e., leading to an Alfv\\'en Mach number of $\\sim2$. Some\nregions above and below the disc mid-plane show sub-Alfv\\'enic conditions with\nintermittent outflow activity. The disc density profiles steepen over time,\nfollowing a power law consistent with observed young stellar discs and the\nminimum mass solar nebula.

The cluster masses are high,\n$\\sim10^6-10^7~M_{\\odot}$, which may explain why we are able to detect them\naround this likely post-merger galaxy. Overall, the Relic clusters are\nconsistent with being precursors of the most massive present-day GCs. This\nunique laboratory enables the first connection between long-lived,\nhigh-redshift clusters and local stellar populations, offering insights into\nthe early stages of GC evolution and the broader processes of galaxy assembly.",

In this work, we introduce ${\\bf C}$ommittee ${\\bf V}$oting for ${\\bf\nD}$ataset ${\\bf D}$istillation (CV-DD), a novel and orthogonal approach that\nleverages the collective wisdom of multiple models or experts to create\nhigh-quality distilled datasets.

By integrating distributions and predictions from a committee of\nmodels while generating high-quality soft labels, our method captures a wider\nspectrum of data features, reduces model-specific biases and the adverse\neffects of distribution shifts, leading to significant improvements in\ngeneralization. This voting-based strategy not only promotes diversity and\nrobustness within the distilled dataset but also significantly reduces\noverfitting, resulting in improved performance on post-eval tasks. Extensive\nexperiments across various datasets and IPCs (images per class) demonstrate\nthat Committee Voting leads to more reliable and adaptable distilled data\ncompared to single/multi-model distillation methods, demonstrating its\npotential for efficient and accurate dataset distillation.

This setup allows us to construct other statistic-preserving\ninvolutions on tableaux of rectangular shape, providing a simple proof of the\nfact that ascents and descents are equidistributed up to a shift, and proving a\nconjecture of Sulanke about certain statistics in the case of three rows.\nFinally, we use our bijections to define a possible notion of rowmotion on\nstandard Young tableaux of rectangular shape, and to give a bijective proof of\nthe symmetry of the number of descents on canon permutations, which have been\nrecently studied as a variation of Stirling and quasi-Stirling permutations.",

Recent years have witnessed the consistent\ndevelopment of learning algorithms for binary classification problems where one\ncan instead observe paired covariates and binary variable representing the\nstatistical relationship between the covariates. In this work, we theoretically\nstudy the question of whether multiple smooth boundaries are learnable if the\npairwise binary classification setting is considered. We investigate the\nquestion with the statistical dependence of paired covariates to develop a\nlearning algorithm using vector-valued functions. The main theorem shows that\nthere is an empirical risk minimization algorithm in a class of deep ReLU\nnetworks such that it produces a consistent estimator for indicator functions\ndefined with smooth boundaries. We also discuss how the pairwise binary\nclassification setting is different from the conventional settings, focusing on\nthe structural condition of function classes.

    "abstract": "Pre-routing slack prediction remains a critical area of research in\nElectronic Design Automation (EDA). Despite numerous machine learning-based\napproaches targeting this task, there is still a lack of a truly end-to-end\nframework that engineers can use to obtain TNS/WNS metrics from raw circuit\ndata at the placement stage. Existing works have demonstrated effectiveness in\nArrival Time (AT) prediction but lack a mechanism for Required Arrival Time\n(RAT) prediction, which is essential for slack prediction and obtaining TNS/WNS\nmetrics. In this work, we propose E2ESlack, an end-to-end graph-based framework\nfor pre-routing slack prediction. The framework includes a TimingParser that\nsupports DEF, SDF and LIB files for feature extraction and graph construction,\nan arrival time prediction model and a fast RAT estimation module. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first work capable of predicting path-level\nslacks at the pre-routing stage. We perform extensive experiments and\ndemonstrate that our proposed RAT estimation method outperforms the SOTA\nML-based prediction method and also pre-routing STA tool. Additionally, the\nproposed E2ESlack framework achieves TNS/WNS values comparable to post-routing\nSTA results while saving up to 23x runtime.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenge of generating temporally consistent\nvideos with motion guidance. While many existing methods depend on additional\ncontrol modules or inference-time fine-tuning, recent studies suggest that\neffective motion guidance is achievable without altering the model architecture\nor requiring extra training. Such approaches offer promising compatibility with\nvarious video generation foundation models. However, existing training-free\nmethods often struggle to maintain consistent temporal coherence across frames\nor to follow guided motion accurately. In this work, we propose a simple yet\neffective solution that combines an initial-noise-based approach with a novel\nmotion consistency loss, the latter being our key innovation. Specifically, we\ncapture the inter-frame feature correlation patterns of intermediate features\nfrom a video diffusion model to represent the motion pattern of the reference\nvideo. We then design a motion consistency loss to maintain similar feature\ncorrelation patterns in the generated video, using the gradient of this loss in\nthe latent space to guide the generation process for precise motion control.\nThis approach improves temporal consistency across various motion control tasks\nwhile preserving the benefits of a training-free setup. Extensive experiments\nshow that our method sets a new standard for efficient, temporally coherent\nvideo generation.",

The states have opposite phase and equal amplitudes.\nAn extra drive at half the modulation frequency provides an effective bias that\nlifts the state symmetry. Quantum fluctuations lead to switching between the\nstates, i.e., to phase-flip transitions. We develop a semiclassical approach\nthat allows us to find the dependence of the switching rates on the amplitude\nof the bias and the parameters of the modulating field. We find that the rate\nof switching from a ''shallow'' state can become anomalously small at certain\nparameter values, leading to an efficient localization in this state.

To do this, we 1)\nsimulate a Euclid-like observation and generate mock shear catalogues from\nmultiple realisations of the 3x2pt fields on the sky, and 2) measure the 3x2pt\nPseudo-Cl power spectra for a given tomographic configuration and derive the\nconstraints that they place on the standard dark energy equation of state\nparameters (w0, wa). For a simulation including Gaussian-distributed\nphotometric redshift uncertainty and shape noise under a LambdaCDM cosmology,\nwe find that bins equipopulated with galaxies yield the best constraints on\n(w0, wa) for an analysis of the full 3x2pt signal, or the angular clustering\ncomponent only. For the cosmic shear component, the optimum (w0, wa)\nconstraints are achieved by bins equally spaced in fiducial comoving distance.\nHowever, the advantage with respect to alternative binning choices is only a\nfew percent in the size of the $1\\,\\sigma\\,$(w0, wa) contour, and we conclude\nthat the cosmic shear is relatively insensitive to the binning methodology. We\nfind that the information gain extracted on (w0, wa) for any 3x2pt component\nstarts to saturate at $\\gtrsim$ 7-8 bins. Any marginal gains resulting from a\ngreater number of bins is likely to be limited by additional uncertainties\npresent in a real measurement, and the increasing demand for accuracy of the\ncovariance matrix. Finally, we consider a 5% contamination from catastrophic\nphotometric redshift outliers and find that, if these errors are not mitigated\nin the analysis, the bias induced in the 3x2pt signal for 10 equipopulated bins\nresults in dark energy constraints that are inconsistent with the fiducial\nLambdaCDM cosmology at $>5\\,\\sigma$.",

In recent years, deep learning-based image\nmatching algorithms have dramatically outperformed humans in rapidly and\naccurately finding large amounts of correspondences. However, when dealing with\nimages captured under different imaging modalities that result in significant\nappearance changes, the performance of these algorithms often deteriorates due\nto the scarcity of annotated cross-modal training data. This limitation hinders\napplications in various fields that rely on multiple image modalities to obtain\ncomplementary information.

    "abstract": "The free Jacobi process is the radial part of the compression of the free\nunitary Brownian motion by two free orthogonal projections in a non commutative\nprobability space. In this paper, we derive spectral properties of the free\nJacobi process associated with projections having the same rank $\\alpha \\in\n(0,1)$. To start with, we determine the characteristic curves of the partial\ndifferential equation satisfied by the moment generating function of its\nspectral distribution. Doing so leads for any fixed time $t >0$ to an\nexpression of this function in a neighborhood of the origin, therefore extends\nour previous results valid for $\\alpha = 1/2$. Moreover, the obtained\ncharacteristic curves are encoded by an $\\alpha$-deformation of the\ncompositional inverse of the $\\chi$-transform of the spectral distribution of\nthe free unitary Brownian motion. In this respect, we study mapping properties\nof this deformation and use the saddle point method to prove that the\ncompositional inverse of a $\\alpha$-deformation of the $\\chi$-transform of the\nfree unitary Brownian motion is analytic in the open unit disc (for large\nenough time $t$). The last part of the paper is devoted to a dynamical version\nof a recent identity pointed out by T. Kunisky in \\cite{Kun}. Actually, this\nidentity relates the stationary distributions of the free Jacobi processes\ncorresponding to the sets of parameters $(\\alpha, \\alpha)$ and $(1/2,\\alpha)$\nrespectively and we explain how it follows from the Nica-Speicher semi-group.\nOur dynamical version then relates the partial differential equations of the\nCauchy-Stieltjes transforms of the densities of the finite-time spectral\ndistributions. It also raises the problem of whether a dynamical analogue of\nthe Nica-Speicher semi-group exists when the compressing projection has rank\n$1/2$.",

This difficulty is compounded if one includes flavor\ntransformation -- an intrinsically quantum phenomenon requiring one to follow\nthe coherence between flavors and thus necessitating the introduction of\ncomplex numbers. To reduce the computational burden, simulations of compact\nobjects that include neutrino transport often make use of\nmomentum-angle-integrated moments (the lowest order ones being commonly\nreferred to as the energy density and flux) and these quantities can be\ngeneralized to include neutrino flavor, i.e., they become quantum moments.\nNumerous finite-volume approaches to solving the moment evolution equations for\nclassical neutrino transport have been developed based on solving a Riemann\nproblem at cell interfaces. In this paper we describe our generalization of a\nRiemann solver for quantum moments, specifically decomposing complex numbers in\nterms of a (signed) magnitude and phase instead of real and imaginary parts. We\nthen test our new algorithm in numerous cases showing a neutrino fast flavor\ninstability, varying from toy models with analytic solutions to snapshots from\nneutron star merger simulations.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has been integrated into nearly every aspect of daily\nlife, powering applications from object detection with computer vision to large\nlanguage models for writing emails and compact models for use in smart homes.\nThese machine learning models at times cater to the needs of individual users\nbut are often detached from them, as they are typically stored and processed in\ncentralized data centers. This centralized approach raises privacy concerns,\nincurs high infrastructure costs, and struggles to provide real time,\npersonalized experiences. Federated and fully decentralized learning methods\nhave been proposed to address these issues, but they still depend on\ncentralized servers or face slow convergence due to communication constraints.\nWe propose ML Mule, an approach that utilizes individual mobile devices as\n'mules' to train and transport model snapshots as the mules move through\nphysical spaces, sharing these models with the physical 'spaces' the mules\ninhabit. This method implicitly forms affinity groups among devices associated\nwith users who share particular spaces, enabling collaborative model evolution\nand protecting users' privacy. Our approach addresses several major\nshortcomings of traditional, federated, and fully decentralized learning\nsystems. ML Mule represents a new class of machine learning methods that are\nmore robust, distributed, and personalized, bringing the field closer to\nrealizing the original vision of intelligent, adaptive, and genuinely\ncontext-aware smart environments. Our results show that ML Mule converges\nfaster and achieves higher model accuracy compared to other existing methods.",

In such\nsituations, understanding tree similarities is a key challenge, and therefore\nwe present an approach to determine distances between trees. Considering the\nbounded height of trees, we determine the distances associated with the swap\noperations over strings. While in general, by solving the {\\sc Maximum Common\nAlmost $v$-tree} problem between two trees, we describe an efficient approach\nto determine the minimum number of operations to transform one tree into\nanother. The inherent noise in current statistical methods for constructing\nmutation evolution trees of cancer cells presents a significant challenge:\nhandling such collections of trees to determine a consensus tree that\naccurately represents the set and evaluating the extent of their variability or\ndispersion. Given a set of mutation trees and the notion of distance, there are\nat least two natural ways to define the ``target'' tree, such as a min-sum\n(\\emph{median tree}) or a min-max (\\emph{closest tree}) of a set of trees.\nThus, considering a set of trees as input and dealing with the {\\sc median} and\n{\\sc closest} problems, we prove that both problems are \\NP-complete, even with\nonly three input trees.

    "abstract": "Context. Magnetically arrested disks are among the most suitable candidates\nfor describing the gas accretion and observed emission in the vicinity of\nsupermassive black holes. Aims. This work aims to provide a direct correlation\nbetween the quasi-periodic flux eruption events, characteristic of MAD\naccretion disk simulations, and the observed flaring behavior in the Galactic\ncenter. Methods. We employ a MAD accretion disk with a distinct\ncounter-clockwise rotation and investigate the evolution of magnetized flux\ntubes generated during a prominent flux eruption event. Although these flux\ntubes demonstrate a clockwise pattern, they experience significant dragging by\nthe accretion disk's rotation. This study models the motion of hot spots,\nformed on the disk's equatorial plane due to magnetic reconnection, as they\ntravel along the magnetized flux tubes at a fraction of the speed of light.\nResults. Hot spots with a relativistic ejection velocity are able to balance\nout the counter-clockwise dragging of the flux tube's foot-point on the disk\nand demonstrate a clockwise motion in the sky, that is in good agreement with\nthe NIR flares in the Galactic center. In addition, our flare models favor\nface-on inclinations in the range $[0^\\circ, 34^\\circ]$ and $[163^\\circ,\n180^\\circ]$ for SgrA*. Conclusions. The flux eruption events that arise\nnaturally in the MAD accretion state provide a promising framework for\nreproducing the observed flaring behavior in the vicinity of SgrA*.",

We then simulate solid particles through the disk as a post-processing\nstep using a Monte Carlo integration, allowing us to track the trajectories of\nindividual particles as they travel throughout the disk. We find that gas\nadvection onto the planet can carry small, well-coupled solids across the gap\nopened in the disk by the embedded planet for planetary masses above the pebble\nisolation mass. This mixing between the inner and outer disk can occur in both\ndirections, with solids in the inner disk mixing to the outer disk as well.\nAdditionally, in low viscosity disks, multiple pile-ups in the outer disk may\npreserve isotopic heterogeneities, possibly providing an outermost tertiary\nisotopic reservoir. Throughout Jupiter's growth, the extent of mixing between\nisotopic reservoirs varied depending on dust size, gas turbulence, and the\nJovian embryo mass.",

In\nparticular, the half-integer Quantum Hall Effect (HI-QHE) characterized by the\nquantization of Hall resistivity as a function of applied magnetic field,\noffers opportunities for advancements in quantum metrology and the\nunderstanding of topological quantum states in this 2D material. While the role\nof disorder in stabilizing quantum Hall plateaus (QHPs) is widely recognized,\nthe precise interplay between the plateaus width, disorder, mobility and\ncarrier density remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the width\nof the $\\nu=6$ QHP in epitaxial graphene Hall bars, focusing on two distinct\nregions of the device with markedly different electronic mobilities. Depending\non the storage conditions, it is possible to modify the carrier density of\ngraphene QHE devices and consequently increase or reduce the mobility. Our\nexperiments reveal mobility variations of up to 200$\\%$ from their initial\nvalue. In particular, the sample storage time and ambient conditions cause also\nnoticeable changes in the positions and extension of the QHPs. Our results show\nthat the QHP extension for $\\nu=6$ differs significantly between the two\nregions, influenced by both mobility and disorder, rather than solely by\ncarrier density. Transport simulations based on the Landauer-B\\\"uttiker\nformalism with Anderson disorder in a scaled model reveal the critical role of\nimpurities in shaping graphene transport properties defining the extension of\nthe QHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the interplay between\nmobility, disorder, and quantum transport in graphene systems.",

    "abstract": "Power systems naturally experience disturbances, some of which can damage\nequipment and disrupt consumers. It is important to quickly assess the likely\nconsequences of credible disturbances and take preventive action, if necessary.\nHowever, assessing the impact of potential disturbances is challenging because\nmany of the influential factors, such as loading patterns, controller settings\nand load dynamics, are not precisely known. To address this issue, the paper\nintroduces the concept of parameter-space recovery regions. For each\ndisturbance, the corresponding recovery region is the region of parameter space\nfor which the system will recover to the desired operating point. The boundary\nof the recovery region establishes the separation between parameter values that\nresult in trouble-free recovery and those that incur undesirable non-recovery.\nThe safety margin for a given set of parameter values is defined as the\nsmallest distance (in parameter space) between the given values and the\nrecovery boundary. Novel numerical algorithms with theoretical guarantees are\npresented for efficiently computing recovery boundaries and safety margins.\nUnlike prior methods, which tend to be overly conservative and restricted to\nlow dimensional parameter space, these methods compute safety margins to\narbitrary user-specified accuracy and do so efficiently in high dimensional\nparameter space. The efficacy of the methods is demonstrated using the IEEE\n39-bus benchmark power system, where safety margins are computed for cases that\nconsider up to 86 parameters, and reveal unexpected safety implications that\nwould not have been observed otherwise.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of online shopping has made consumer search data\nincreasingly available, opening up new possibilities for empirical research.\nSequential search models offer a structured approach for analyzing such data,\nbut their estimation remains difficult. This is because consumers make optimal\ndecisions based on private information revealed in search, which is not\nobserved in typical data. As a result, the model's likelihood function involves\nhigh-dimensional integrals that require intensive simulation. This paper\nintroduces a new representation that shows a consumer's optimal search\ndecision-making can be recast as a partial ranking over all actions available\nthroughout the consumer's search process. This reformulation yields the same\nchoice probabilities as the original model but leads to a simpler likelihood\nfunction that relies less on simulation. Based on this insight, we provide\nidentification arguments and propose a modified GHK-style simulator that\nimproves both estimation performances and ease of implementation. The proposed\napproach also generalizes to a wide range of model variants, including those\nwith incomplete search data and structural extensions such as search with\nproduct discovery. It enables a tractable and unified estimation strategy\nacross different settings in sequential search models, offering both a new\nperspective on understanding sequential search and a practical tool for its\napplication.",

These\nobjects have a redshift of z less than 0.04 so that the [SIII] 9069 A emission\nline and H beta equivalent widths that are higher than 10 A in emission were\nincluded, and they are compact in appearance. We used the so-called direct\nmethod for objects with the electron-temperature-sensitive [SIII] 6312 A\nemission line, and an empirical method based on the S23 parameter. The last\nprovided an abundance calibration that monotonically increased up to at least\nthe solar value, and can be applied based on the spectral range from 6000 to\n9500 A alone. We show that the bias that is introduced when the [OIII] 4363 A\nline is required restricts the sample to objects with an [OIII] electron\ntemperature higher than 10,000K, and their temperature distribution is then\nrather narrow. For objects with determinations of te [SIII], the distribution\nis flatter and wider, which fits a more realistic scenario better. For the\nobjects in the sample that required the detection of the [OIII] 4363 A line and\n[SIII] 6312 A, the distribution abundances as traced directly by oxygen and\nsulphur appear to be very similar to each other.

The main idea is to extract important directional\ninformation from experiences with different performance levels, named ratings,\nso that policies can be updated towards desired deviation from these\nexperiences with different ratings. Specifically, we propose a new policy loss\nfunction that penalizes distribution similarities between the current policy\nand failed experiences with different ratings, and assign different weights to\nthe penalty terms based on the rating classes. Meanwhile, reward learning from\nthese rated samples can be integrated with the new policy loss towards an\nintegrated reward and policy learning from rated samples. Optimizing the\nintegrated reward and policy loss function will lead to the discovery of\ndirections for policy improvement towards maximizing cumulative rewards and\npenalizing most from the lowest performance level while least from the highest\nperformance level.

    "abstract": "This work exploits a framework whereby a graph (in the mathematical sense)\nserves to connect a classical system to a state space that we call\n`quantum-like' (QL). The QL states comprise arbitrary superpositions of states\nin a tensor product basis. The graph plays a special dual role by directing\ndesign of the classical system and defining the state space. We study a\nspecific example of a large, dynamical classical system -- a system of coupled\nphase oscillators -- that maps, via a graph, to the QL state space. We\ninvestigate how mixedness of the state diminishes or increases as the\nunderlying classical system synchronizes or de-synchronizes respectively. This\nshows the interplay between the nonlinear dynamics of the variables of the\nclassical system and the QL state space. We prove that maps from one time point\nto another in the state space are linear maps. In the limit of a strongly\nphase-locked classical network -- that is, where couplings between phase\noscillators are very large -- the state space evolves according to unitary\ndynamics, whereas in the cases of weaker synchronization, the classical\nvariables act as a hidden environment that promotes decoherence of\nsuperpositions. We examine how similar the properties of QL states are to\nquantum states. We find that during decoherence of the QL states, the\noff-diagonal density matrix elements decay and that this decay can be observed\nin any basis we choose for measurement. More surprisingly, we show that a\nno-cloning theorem (that is, a state of a QL bit cannot be copied) applies not\nonly to the QL states, but also to the underlying classical system.",

    "abstract": "Physical systems experience nonlinear disturbances which have the potential\nto disrupt desired behavior. For a particular disturbance, whether or not the\nsystem recovers from the disturbance to a desired stable equilibrium point\ndepends on system parameter values, which are typically uncertain and\ntime-varying. Therefore, to quantify proximity to vulnerability we define the\nsafety margin to be the smallest change in parameter values from a nominal\nvalue such that the system will no longer be able to recover from the\ndisturbance. Safety margins are valuable but challenging to compute as related\nmethods, such as those for robust region of attraction estimation, are often\neither overly conservative or computationally intractable for high dimensional\nsystems. Recently, we developed algorithms to compute safety margins\nefficiently and non-conservatively by exploiting the large sensitivity of the\nsystem trajectory near the region of attraction boundary to small\nperturbations. Although these algorithms have enjoyed empirical success, they\nlack theoretical guarantees that would ensure their generalizability. This work\ndevelops a novel characterization of safety margins in terms of trajectory\nsensitivities, and uses this to derive well-posedness and convergence\nguarantees for these algorithms, enabling their generalizability and successful\napplication to a large class of nonlinear systems.",

In contrast, we take a different approach;\nleveraging the inherent discrepancies across modalities in violence event\nrepresentation to propose a novel multimodal semantic feature alignment method.\nThis method sparsely maps the semantic features of local, transient, and less\ninformative modalities ( such as audio and optical flow ) into the more\ninformative RGB semantic feature space.

Modified\ntheories of gravity have additional degrees of freedom with their own\nasymptotic evolution equations; these additional fields can produce differences\nin the memory effects in these theories from those in general relativity. In\nthis work, we study a scalar-tensor theory of gravity known as the\nDamour-Esposito-Far\\`ese extension of Brans-Dicke theory. We use the\nBondi-Sachs framework to compute the field equations in Bondi-Sachs form, the\nasymptotically flat solutions, and the leading gravitational-wave memory\neffects. Although Damour-Esposito-Far\\`ese theory has additional nonlinearities\nnot present in Brans-Dicke theory, these nonlinearities are subleading effects;\nthus, the two theories share many similarities in the leading (and some\nsubleading) solutions to hypersurface equations, asymptotic symmetries, and\ntypes of memory effects. The conservation equations for the mass and angular\nmomentum aspects differ between the two theories, primarily because of the\ndifferences in the evolution equation for the scalar field. This leads to\ndifferences in the time dependence of the gravitational-wave memory signals\nthat are produced during the quasicircular inspiral of compact binaries.

In contrast, point clouds are a widely used 3D\nrepresentation and are compatible with most popular 3D processing software, yet\nconverting 3DGS scenes into point clouds is a complex challenge. In this work\nwe introduce 3DGS-to-PC, a flexible and highly customisable framework that is\ncapable of transforming 3DGS scenes into dense, high-accuracy point clouds. We\nsample points probabilistically from each Gaussian as a 3D density function. We\nadditionally threshold new points using the Mahalanobis distance to the\nGaussian centre, preventing extreme outliers. The result is a point cloud that\nclosely represents the shape encoded into the 3D Gaussian scene. Individual\nGaussians use spherical harmonics to adapt colours depending on view, and each\npoint may contribute only subtle colour hints to the resulting rendered scene.\nTo avoid spurious or incorrect colours that do not fit with the final point\ncloud, we recalculate Gaussian colours via a customised image rendering\napproach, assigning each Gaussian the colour of the pixel to which it\ncontributes most across all views. 3DGS-to-PC also supports mesh generation\nthrough Poisson Surface Reconstruction, applied to points sampled from\npredicted surface Gaussians. This allows coloured meshes to be generated from\n3DGS scenes without the need for re-training. This package is highly\ncustomisable and capability of simple integration into existing 3DGS pipelines.\n3DGS-to-PC provides a powerful tool for converting 3DGS data into point cloud\nand surface-based formats.",

We also assessed the suitability of the\nEnhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as a proxy for young leaf production in moist\nevergreen tropical forests. Our results showed that tree species exhibited\ndistinct phenological patterns, with most species producing young leaves during\ntwo seasonal peaks aligned with the rainy seasons. Rainfall, cloud cover, and\nmaximum temperature were the most informative predictors of seasonal variation\nin young leaf production. However, solar radiation and atmospheric CO$_2$ were\nmost informative regarding long-term trends. EVI was strongly correlated with\nyoung leaf production within years but less effective for capturing\ninter-annual trends. These findings highlight the complex relationship between\nclimate and young leaf phenology in moist evergreen tropical forests, and helps\nus understand the changes in food availability for tropical folivores.",

    "abstract": "The computation of collision probability ($\\mathcal{P}_c$) is crucial for\nspace environmentalism and sustainability by providing decision-making\nknowledge that can prevent collisions between anthropogenic space objects.\nHowever, the accuracy and precision of $\\mathcal{P}_c$ computations is often\ncompromised by limitations in computational resources and data availability.\nWhile significant improvements have been made in the computational aspects, the\nrising concerns regarding the privacy of collaborative data sharing can be a\nmajor limiting factor in the future conjunction analysis and risk assessment,\nespecially as the space environment grows increasingly privatized, competitive,\nand fraught with conflicting strategic interests. This paper argues that the\nimportance of privacy measures in space situational awareness (SSA) is\nunderappreciated, and regulatory and compliance measures currently in place are\nnot sufficient by themselves, presenting a significant gap.\n  To address this gap, we introduce a novel encrypted architecture that\nleverages advanced cryptographic techniques, including homomorphic encryption\n(HE) and multi-party computation (MPC), to safeguard the privacy of entities\ncomputing space sustainability metrics, inter alia, $\\mathcal{P}_c$. Our\nproposed protocol, Encrypted $\\mathcal{P}_c$, integrates the Monte Carlo\nestimation algorithm with cryptographic solutions, enabling secure collision\nprobability computation without exposing sensitive or proprietary information.\nThis research advances secure conjunction analysis by developing a secure MPC\nprotocol for $\\mathcal{P}_c$ computation and highlights the need for innovative\nprotocols to ensure a more secure and cooperative SSA landscape.",

    "abstract": "We explore the interaction between numerical rounding errors and\ndiscretization errors involved in linear function approximation schemes. To\nprecisely identify when numerical effects become significant, we introduce the\nconcept of numerical redundancy: a set of functions is numerically redundant\nif, due to finite-precision arithmetic, it spans a lower-dimensional space\nnumerically than it does analytically. This phenomenon arises in a variety of\nsettings, though it is not always explicitly identified as such. When such a\nset is used as a basis for numerical approximations, recovering the expansion\ncoefficients of the best approximation is generally impossible. More\nspecifically, we show that approximations produced by practical\nalgorithms-affected by rounding errors-are implicitly subject to\n$\\ell^2$-regularization. The computed solutions, therefore, exhibit reduced\naccuracy compared to the best approximation. On the other hand, there is also a\nbenefit: regularization reduces the amount of data needed for accurate and\nstable discrete approximation. The primary aim of this paper is to develop the\ntools needed to fully understand this effect. Additionally, we present a\nconstructive method for optimally selecting random data points for\n$L^2$-approximations, explicitly accounting for the influence of rounding\nerrors. We illustrate our results in two typical scenarios that lead to\nnumerical redundancy: (1) approximation on irregular domains and (2)\napproximation that incorporate specific features of the function to be\napproximated. In doing so, we obtain new results on random sampling for Fourier\nextension frames.",

    "abstract": "One of the key steps in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data analysis is\ncomponent separation to recover the CMB signal from multi-frequency\nobservations contaminated by foreground emissions. Needlet Internal Linear\nCombination (NILC) is one of the successful methods that applies the minimum\nvariance estimation technique to a set of needlet-filtered frequency maps to\nrecover CMB. In this work, we develop a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)\nmodel to recover CMB temperature map from needlet-filtered frequency maps over\nthe full sky. The network operates on a multi-resolution representation of\nspherical data, capturing localised features in both pixel and harmonic space,\nand is designed to preserve the rotational invariance of the CMB signal.\n  The network model is trained on realistic simulations at Planck frequencies,\nwhich include CMB temperature maps generated using cosmological parameters\nsampled within a 2$\\sigma$ standard deviation around the Planck best-fit\nvalues. We demonstrate the network performance for simulations that exhibit\ndifferent foreground complexities. The recovered CMB temperature map closely\nfollows the true signal with some residual leakage near the Galactic plane. The\nTT power spectrum is accurately reconstructed up to multipoles of approximately\n$\\ell\\sim 1100$. A minor residual systematics remain at smaller scales.\nCompared to the NILC method, the network shows reduced residual foreground\ncontamination in the recovered CMB map.\n  Once validated on the simulations, the network is applied to Planck PR3\nintensity data. The resulting CMB map is consistent with the CMB maps from the\nPlanck legacy products, including those produced using the NILC and SMICA\npipelines.

    "abstract": "Sense of agency is one factor that influences people's preferences for robot\nassistance and a phenomenon from cognitive science that represents the\nexperience of control over one's environment. However, in assistive robotics\nliterature, we often see paradigms that optimize measures like task success and\ncognitive load, rather than sense of agency. In fact, prior work has found that\nparticipants sometimes express a preference for paradigms, such as direct\nteleoperation, which do not perform well with those other metrics but give more\ncontrol to the user. In this work, we focus on a subset of assistance paradigms\nfor manipulation called shared autonomy in which the system combines control\nsignals from the user and the automated control. We run a study to evaluate\nsense of agency and show that higher robot autonomy during assistance leads to\nimproved task performance but a decreased sense of agency, indicating a\npotential trade-off between task performance and sense of agency. From our\nfindings, we discuss the relation between sense of agency and optimality, and\nwe consider a proxy metric for a component of sense of agency which might\nenable us to build systems that monitor and maintain sense of agency in real\ntime.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a framework to analyze iterative first-order\noptimization algorithms for time-varying convex optimization. We assume that\nthe temporal variability is caused by a time-varying parameter entering the\nobjective, which can be measured at the time of decision but whose future\nvalues are unknown. We consider the case of strongly convex objective functions\nwith Lipschitz continuous gradients under a convex constraint set. We model the\nalgorithms as discrete-time linear parameter varying (LPV) systems in feedback\nwith monotone operators such as the time-varying gradient. We leverage the\napproach of analyzing algorithms as uncertain control interconnections with\nintegral quadratic constraints (IQCs) and generalize that framework to the\ntime-varying case. We propose novel IQCs that are capable of capturing the\nbehavior of time-varying nonlinearities and leverage techniques from the LPV\nliterature to establish novel bounds on the tracking error. Quantitative bounds\ncan be computed by solving a semi-definite program and can be interpreted as an\ninput-to-state stability result with respect to a disturbance signal which\nincreases with the temporal variability of the problem. As a departure from\nresults in this research area, our bounds introduce a dependence on different\nadditional measures of temporal variations, such as the function value and\ngradient rate of change. We exemplify our main results with numerical\nexperiments that showcase how our analysis framework is able to capture\nconvergence rates of different first-order algorithms for time-varying\noptimization through the choice of IQC and rate bounds.",

    "abstract": "OpenAI's o3 achieves a high score of 87.5 % on ARC-AGI, a benchmark proposed\nto measure intelligence. This raises the question whether systems based on\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), particularly o3, demonstrate intelligence and\nprogress towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). Building on the\ndistinction between skills and intelligence made by Fran\\c{c}ois Chollet, the\ncreator of ARC-AGI, a new understanding of intelligence is introduced: an agent\nis the more intelligent, the more efficiently it can achieve the more diverse\ngoals in the more diverse worlds with the less knowledge. An analysis of the\nARC-AGI benchmark shows that its tasks represent a very specific type of\nproblem that can be solved by massive trialling of combinations of predefined\noperations. This method is also applied by o3, achieving its high score through\nthe extensive use of computing power. However, for most problems in the\nphysical world and in the human domain, solutions cannot be tested in advance\nand predefined operations are not available. Consequently, massive trialling of\npredefined operations, as o3 does, cannot be a basis for AGI - instead, new\napproaches are required that can reliably solve a wide variety of problems\nwithout existing skills. To support this development, a new benchmark for\nintelligence is outlined that covers a much higher diversity of unknown tasks\nto be solved, thus enabling a comprehensive assessment of intelligence and of\nprogress towards AGI.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the transonic accretion flow in the spacetime of a\nsupermassive black hole (BH) coupled to an anisotropic dark matter fluid, as\nproposed by Cardoso {\\it et al}. We essentially compare the accretion\nproperties of the Cardoso BH with those of an isolated Schwarzschild BH. The\nCardoso BH is described by the halo mass ($M_{\\rm H}$) and its characteristic\nlength scale ($a_0$). Various classes of accretion solution topologies (e.g., A\nand W-types) are obtained by solving the dynamical equations of the flow in a\nfully general relativistic framework. We find that the global accretion\nsolutions in the identified solution topologies are substantially influenced by\nthe halo parameters ($M_{\\rm H}, a_0$) when the halo mass is high or the dark\nmatter distribution is concentrated near the black hole. In this high\ncompactness regime, different observational signatures of the accretion disc,\nlike the spectral energy distribution (SED) and bolometric disc luminosity, are\nfound to exhibit considerable deviations from the known results in the\nSchwarzschild BH model. Furthermore, we obtain shock-induced accretion\nsolutions, where different shock properties, such as the shock radius ($r_{\\rm\nsh}$), flow mass density ($\\rho$) compression, and electron temperature ($T_e$)\ncompression across the shock front, are potentially altered from those in the\nSchwarzschild BH model when the halo compactness is high. Interestingly, the\nexisting shock parameter space, defined by the flow specific angular momentum\n($\\lambda$) and energy ($E$), is largely reduced for higher halo compactness\ncompared to that of the Schwarzschild BH. These unique features offer a\npossible valuable tool for characterizing the presence or absence of a dark\nmatter halo around a galactic black hole.",

    "abstract": "We consider synthesis and analysis of probability measures using the\nentropy-regularized Wasserstein-2 cost and its unbiased version, the Sinkhorn\ndivergence. The synthesis problem consists of computing the barycenter, with\nrespect to these costs, of reference measures given a set of coefficients\nbelonging to the simplex. The analysis problem consists of finding the\ncoefficients for the closest barycenter in the Wasserstein-2 distance to a\ngiven measure. Under the weakest assumptions on the measures thus far in the\nliterature, we compute the derivative of the entropy-regularized Wasserstein-2\ncost. We leverage this to establish a characterization of barycenters with\nrespect to the entropy-regularized Wasserstein-2 cost as solutions that\ncorrespond to a fixed point of an average of the entropy-regularized\ndisplacement maps. This characterization yields a finite-dimensional, convex,\nquadratic program for solving the analysis problem when the measure being\nanalyzed is a barycenter with respect to the entropy-regularized Wasserstein-2\ncost. We show that these coefficients, as well as the value of the barycenter\nfunctional, can be estimated from samples with dimension-independent rates of\nconvergence, and that barycentric coefficients are stable with respect to\nperturbations in the Wasserstein-2 metric. We employ the barycentric\ncoefficients as features for classification of corrupted point cloud data, and\nshow that compared to neural network baselines, our approach is more efficient\nin small training data regimes.",

The radial distributions of the\nO/H, the gas mass fraction, and the effective oxygen yield in NGC~3521 are\ncompared to that of the Milky Way (MW), with the aim of examining the\nsimilarity in their chemical evolutions. The O/H of two HII regions closest to\nthe centre of the MW (at a radii of 4-5 kpc) are close to the binned O/H in\nNGC~3521 at the same galactocentric distances. The O/H in the outer part of the\nMW are lower than those in the outer part of NGC~3521. The gas mass fraction in\nthe outer part of the MW is higher than in NGC~3521.

Recently, this was also demonstrated in noncentrosymmetric materials\nin magnetic fields, since their band structure exhibits spin polarization\ncoupled to the position of momentum space due to the antisymmetric spin-orbit\ncoupling. To enhance the magnitude of nonreciprocal effect, it is essential to\ntune such spin-momentum coupling, which has been hampered in the conventional\nmaterials owing to the difficulty in controlling the broken inversion symmetry\nbuilt into the lattice and interfacial structures. Here we report large\nnonreciprocal resistivity in layered polar metal BaMn$X_2$ ($X$=Sb, Bi), where\nthe spin-polarized Dirac dispersion depends on the in-plane polarization\ntunable by chemical substitution of the $X$ site. For $X$=Sb with a pair of\nsingle-type valleys, the nonreciprocal resistivity increases monotonically with\ndecreasing temperature, while for $X$=Bi with multiple types of valleys it is\nreduced by about an order of magnitude and exhibits a peak at a low\ntemperature. Theoretical calculations indicate that the nonreciprocal\nresistivity is sensitive not only to the spin-momentum (spin-valley) coupling,\nbut also to the Fermi energy and the Dirac dispersion. The observed significant\nvariation of nonreciprocal transport in the same series of materials might be\nof great use in the design of junction-free rectifying devices and circuits.",

Modeling this problem accurately presents\nsignificant challenges due to the complex physics involved in strongly coupled\nporomechanics and frictional contact mechanics of fractures. The robustness and\nefficiency of the simulation heavily depends on a preconditioner for the linear\nsolver, which addresses the Jacobian matrices arising from Newton's method in\nfully implicit time-stepping schemes. Developing an effective preconditioner is\ndifficult because it must decouple three interdependent subproblems: momentum\nbalance, fluid mass balance, and contact mechanics. The challenge is further\ncompounded by the saddle-point structure of the contact mechanics problem, a\nresult of the Augmented Lagrange formulation, which hinders the direct\napplication of the well-established fixed stress approximation to decouple the\nporomechanics subproblem. In this work, we propose a preconditioner hat\ncombines nested Schur complement approximations with a linear transformation,\nwhich addresses the singular nature of the contact mechanics subproblem. This\napproach extends the fixed stress scheme to both the matrix and fracture\nsubdomains. We investigate analytically how the contact mechanics subproblem\naffects the convergence of the proposed fixed stress-based iterative scheme and\ndemonstrate how it can be translated into a practical preconditioner.

Therefore, strategic\nallocation of attention is crucial in performing the task efficiently. This\nwork aims to understand this strategy. Recently, de Gee et al. conducted\nexperiments involving mice performing an auditory sustained attention-value\ntask. This task required the mice to exert attention to identify whether a\nhigh-order acoustic feature was present amid the noise. By varying the trial\nduration and reward magnitude, the task allows us to investigate how an agent\nshould strategically deploy their attention to maximize their benefits and\nminimize their costs. In our work, we develop a reinforcement learning-based\nnormative model of the mice to understand how it balances attention cost\nagainst its benefits. The model is such that at each moment the mice can choose\nbetween two levels of attention and decide when to take costly actions that\ncould obtain rewards. Our model suggests that efficient use of attentional\nresources involves alternating blocks of high attention with blocks of low\nattention. In the extreme case where the agent disregards sensory input during\nlow attention states, we see that high attention is used rhythmically. Our\nmodel provides evidence about how one should deploy attention as a function of\ntask utility, signal statistics, and how attention affects sensory evidence.",

While effective, the practical\nimplementation of such feedback strategies is often constrained by the high\ndimensionality of state spaces and the computational challenges associated with\nsolving SDREs, particularly in parametric scenarios. To mitigate these\nlimitations, we introduce the Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation (DLRA)\nmethodology, which provides an efficient and accurate framework for addressing\nhigh-dimensional feedback control problems. DLRA dynamically constructs a\ncompact, low-dimensional representation that evolves with the problem, enabling\nthe simultaneous resolution of multiple parametric instances in real-time.\n  We propose two novel algorithms to enhance numerical performances: the\ncascade-Newton-Kleinman method and Riccati-based DLRA (R-DLRA).

R-DLRA integrates Riccati information into\nthe DLRA basis construction to improve the quality of the solution.

This assumption imposes the existence of\nan unobserved global ranking among all the players/teams/items and monotone\nconstraints on the comparison probabilities implied by the global ranking.\nHowever, the stochastic transitivity assumption does not hold in many\nreal-world scenarios of pairwise comparisons, especially games involving\nmultiple skills or strategies. As a result, models relying on this assumption\ncan have suboptimal predictive performance. In this paper, we propose a general\nfamily of statistical models for pairwise comparison data without a stochastic\ntransitivity assumption, substantially extending the BT and Thurstone models.\nIn this model, the pairwise probabilities are determined by a (approximately)\nlow-dimensional skew-symmetric matrix. Likelihood-based estimation methods and\ncomputational algorithms are developed, which allow for sparse data with only a\nsmall proportion of observed pairs. Theoretical analysis shows that the\nproposed estimator achieves minimax-rate optimality, which adapts effectively\nto the sparsity level of the data.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have examined the role of tides in the star formation process.\nThey suggest, notably, that the tides determine the characteristic mass of the\nstellar initial mass function (IMF) by preventing the collapse of density\nfluctuations that would become gravitationally unstable in the absence of the\ntidal field generated by a neighboring central mass. However, most of these\nstudies consider the tidal collapse condition as a 1D process or use a scalar\nvirial condition and thus neglect the anisotropy of the tidal field and its\ncompressive effects. In the present paper, we consider a turbulence-induced\ndensity perturbation formed in the envelope of a central core. This\nperturbation is subject to a tidal field generated by the central core. We\nstudy its evolution taking dynamical effects and the anisotropy of the tides\ninto account. Based on the general tensorial virial equations, we determine a\nnew collapse condition that takes these mechanisms into account. We identify\ntwo regimes: (i) a weak tidal regime in which the dynamics of the perturbation\nis only slightly modified by the action of the tides and (ii) a strong tidal\nregime in which the density threshold for collapse can potentially be increased\ndue to the combined effects of the tides and the rotational support generated\nby the tidal synchronization of the perturbation with the orbital motion. In\nthe case of a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the vicinity of\na first Larson core, we show that the density threshold above which the\nperturbation collapses is increased only for low-mass perturbations (less than\n2.7 solar mass) and only by at most a factor of 1.5. We conclude that tides\nlikely do not play a major role in the process of star formation or in the\ndetermination of the characteristic mass of the IMF. We propose an alternative\nexplanation for the observed value of the characteristic mass of the IMF.",

To address this, we\npropose a novel approach that guides SAM towards the relevant object parts. Our\nmethod learns positional prompts from coarse patch annotations that are easier\nand cheaper to acquire. We train classifiers on image patches to identify part\nclasses and aggregate patches into regions of interest (ROIs) with positional\nprompts. SAM is conditioned on these ROIs and prompts. This approach, termed\n`Guided SAM', enhances efficiency and reduces manual effort, allowing effective\npart segmentation with minimal labeled data. We demonstrate the efficacy of\nGuided SAM on a dataset of car parts, improving the average IoU on state of the\nart models from 0.37 to 0.49 with annotations that are on average five times\nmore efficient to acquire.",

The proposed system integrates solar and\nwind power with energy storage, including seasonal thermal energy storage\n(STES) and battery, coupled via a heat pump.

To model heat\ntransfer between the storage and the ground in the STES system, we employ a\nmulti-node lumped-parameter method.

These issues are prominent in\nneuroscience, where data from multiple subjects exposed to the same stimuli are\nanalyzed to uncover brain activity dynamics. In magnetoencephalography (MEG),\nwhere signals are captured at the scalp level, estimating the brain's\nunderlying sources is crucial, especially in group studies where sources are\nassumed to be similar for all subjects. Common methods, such as Multi-View\nIndependent Component Analysis (MVICA), assume identical sources across\nsubjects, but this assumption is often too restrictive due to individual\nvariability and age-related changes. Multi-View Independent Component Analysis\nwith Delays (MVICAD) addresses this by allowing sources to differ up to a\ntemporal delay. However, temporal dilation effects, particularly in auditory\nstimuli, are common in brain dynamics, making the estimation of time delays\nalone insufficient. To address this, we propose Multi-View Independent\nComponent Analysis with Delays and Dilations (MVICAD2), which allows sources to\ndiffer across subjects in both temporal delays and dilations. We present a\nmodel with identifiable sources, derive an approximation of its likelihood in\nclosed form, and use regularization and optimization techniques to enhance\nperformance. Through simulations, we demonstrate that MVICAD2 outperforms\nexisting multi-view ICA methods.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)\nguided by prompt engineering have gained attention for their ability to handle\na broad range of tasks, including unit test generation. Despite their success,\nLLMs may exhibit hallucinations when generating unit tests for focal methods or\nfunctions due to their lack of awareness regarding the project's global\ncontext. These hallucinations may manifest as calls to non-existent methods, as\nwell as incorrect parameters or return values, such as mismatched parameter\ntypes or numbers. While many studies have explored the role of context, they\noften extract fixed patterns of context for different models and focal methods,\nwhich may not be suitable for all generation processes (e.g., excessive\nirrelevant context could lead to redundancy, preventing the model from focusing\non essential information). To overcome this limitation, we propose RATester,\nwhich enhances the LLM's ability to generate more repository-aware unit tests\nthrough global contextual information injection. To equip LLMs with global\nknowledge similar to that of human testers, we integrate the language server\ngopls, which provides essential features (e.g., definition lookup) to assist\nthe LLM. When RATester encounters an unfamiliar identifier (e.g., an unfamiliar\nstruct name), it first leverages gopls to fetch relevant definitions and\ndocumentation comments, and then uses this global knowledge to guide the LLM.\nBy utilizing gopls, RATester enriches the LLM's knowledge of the project's\nglobal context, thereby reducing hallucinations during unit test generation.",

We find the median, 16th and 84th\npercentiles for the following model parameters: redshift zphot=3.3(+0.7)(-0.6),\napparent size {\\mu}d=5.2(+0.9)(-2.4) kpc, apparent dust mass\nlog10({\\mu}Md/Msun)=9.14(+0.12)(-0.04) and cutoff temperature\nTc=35.6(+4.8)(-1.6) K, and the corresponding apparent far-infrared luminosity\nlog10({\\mu}LIR/Lsun)=13.6(+0.2)(-0.3), where {\\mu} is lensing magnification.\nWhile many of the properties broadly agree with those of samples of primarily\nlensed DSFGs, we exercise caution in interpreting them. ACT's lower flux limit,\nthe PCAT decomposition, and the higher-resolution SMA observations all suggest\nthat some fraction of these DSFGs are likely to be unlensed and possibly\nmultiples. The SMA data indicate that at least fourteen out of nineteen sources\nare such, either via \"missing\" flux in comparison to the ensemble model or\ndetection of additional sources in the fields. Additional high-resolution\nfollow-up and targeted redshift observations are needed to better understand\nthis flux-limited sample of DSFGs.",

    "abstract": "Using techniques from many-body quantum theory, we propose a framework for\nrepresenting the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic flows\nthrough infinite-dimensional rotation systems on tori. This approach is based\non a class of weighted Fock spaces $F_w(\\mathcal H_\\tau)$ generated by a\n1-parameter family of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces $\\mathcal H_\\tau$, and\nendowed with commutative Banach algebra structure under the symmetric tensor\nproduct using a subconvolutive weight $w$. We describe the construction of the\nspaces $F_w(\\mathcal H_\\tau)$ and show that their Banach algebra spectra,\n$\\sigma(F_w(\\mathcal H_\\tau))$, decompose into a family of tori of potentially\ninfinite dimension. Spectrally consistent unitary approximations $U^t_\\tau$ of\nthe Koopman operator acting on $\\mathcal H_\\tau$ are then lifted to rotation\nsystems on these tori akin to the topological models of ergodic systems with\npure point spectra in the Halmos--von Neumann theorem. Our scheme also employs\na procedure for representing observables of the original system by polynomial\nfunctions on finite-dimensional tori in $\\sigma(F_w(\\mathcal H_\\tau))$ of\narbitrarily large degree, with coefficients determined from pointwise products\nof eigenfunctions of $U^t_\\tau$. This leads to models for the Koopman evolution\nof observables on $L^2$ built from tensor products of finite collections of\napproximate Koopman eigenfunctions. Numerically, the scheme is amenable to\nconsistent data-driven implementation using kernel methods. We illustrate it\nwith applications to Stepanoff flows on the 2-torus and the Lorenz 63 system.\nConnections with quantum computing are also discussed.",

Our observations\nreveal the presence of HI in both the disc and outer regions of the galaxy for\nthe first time, with a total HI mass of ($3.5 \\pm\\ 0.4) \\times 10^{8}$\nM$_{\\odot}$. ESO 137-001 is at an advanced stage of gas stripping; it is\nextremely HI deficient and seems to have lost 90% of its initial HI mass; about\n2/3 of the surviving HI is found at a larger radius than expected for a normal\nHI disc and forms a $\\sim40$ kpc tail coincident with the tail detected at\nother wavelengths. Only $\\sim10$% of the surviving HI is still found within the\nstellar disc, consistent with the expectation of an outside-in truncation due\nto ram pressure. Similarly to other jellyfish galaxies, ESO137-001 has a high\nstar formation rate for the low amount of HI detected. We measure an HI\ndepletion time of 0.29 Gyr. However, when taking into account the total gas (HI\n+ H$_2$) content, the depletion time is consistent with typical values measured\nin nearby spiral galaxies. This suggests that ESO 137-001 is at its current\nstage of ram pressure interaction characterised by an efficient HI stripping,\nrather than an enhanced conversion of HI to H$_2$, which was recently observed\nin some other jellyfish galaxies.",

Our recent\nstudies have shown that GRG can be up to four times more abundant in hard X-ray\nselected (i.e. from INTEGRAL/IBIS and Swift/BAT at $>$20 keV) samples and, most\ninterestingly, the majority of them present signs of restarted radio activity.\nThis makes them the ideal test-bed to study the so far unknown duty cycle of\njets in active galactic nuclei.

Our group has recently collected a\nwealth of radio data on these high-energy selected GRGs, allowing us to study\ntheir jet formation and evolution from the pc to kpc scales, across different\nactivity epochs.

The steepening suggests synchrotron cooling is an important process for\nSgr A*'s variability and implies magnetic field strengths $\\sim$40--70 Gauss in\nthe emission zone. Observations at $1.3~\\mathrm{mm}$ with the Submillimeter\nArray revealed a counterpart flare lagging the MIR flare by $\\approx$10\nminutes.

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythms regulate the physiology and behavior of humans and animals.\nDespite advancements in understanding these rhythms and predicting circadian\nphases at the transcriptional level, predicting circadian phases from proteomic\ndata remains elusive. This challenge is largely due to the scarcity of time\nlabels in proteomic datasets, which are often characterized by small sample\nsizes, high dimensionality, and significant noise. Furthermore, existing\nmethods for predicting circadian phases from transcriptomic data typically rely\non prior knowledge of known rhythmic genes, making them unsuitable for\nproteomic datasets. To address this gap, we developed a novel computational\nmethod using unsupervised deep learning techniques to predict circadian sample\nphases from proteomic data without requiring time labels or prior knowledge of\nproteins or genes. Our model involves a two-stage training process optimized\nfor robust circadian phase prediction: an initial greedy one-layer-at-a-time\npre-training which generates informative initial parameters followed by\nfine-tuning. During fine-tuning, a specialized loss function guides the model\nto align protein expression levels with circadian patterns, enabling it to\naccurately capture the underlying rhythmic structure within the data. We tested\nour method on both time-labeled and unlabeled proteomic data. For labeled data,\nwe compared our predictions to the known time labels, achieving high accuracy,\nwhile for unlabeled human datasets, including postmortem brain regions and\nurine samples, we explored circadian disruptions. Notably, our analysis\nidentified disruptions in rhythmic proteins between Alzheimer's disease and\ncontrol subjects across these samples.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that there is considerable variation in the\ndust-to-gas density ratio in the vicinity of low-mass planets undergoing\ngrowth. This can lead to a significant change in the planetary momentum exerted\nby the gas and solid material. However, due to the low dust-to-gas mass ratio\nof protoplanetary disks, the back-reaction of the solid material, is often\nneglected. We study the effect of the back-reaction of solid material on the\ntorques felt by low-mass planets. We performed locally isothermal, 2D\nhydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk interactions. Low-mass planets in the\nrange of 0.1-10MEarth accrete only solid material. Simulations were compared\nwith and without taking into account the back-reaction of the solid material on\nthe gas. The solid component was assumed to have a fixed Stokes number in the\nrange 0.01-10. In general, the inclusion of back-reaction results in a greater\nnumber of models with positive torque values compared to models that neglect\nback-reaction. It is clear, therefore, that the simulation of planetary growth\nand migration via hydrodynamic modeling requires the inclusion of solid-gas\nback-reaction. As a result of the back-reaction and accretion, a Mars-sized\nplanetary embryo will experience positive total torques from the disk\ncontaining coupled solid components St<=0.01. Earth-mass planets also\nexperience positive total torques from the disk containing boulder-sized solid\ncomponents 2<=St<=5. The accretion of weakly coupled solid material tends to\nincrease the positive torques and decrease the negative torques. Our results\nsuggest that the combined effect of back-reaction and accretion is beneficial\nto the formation of planetary systems by reducing the likelihood of a young\nplanet being engulfed by the central star.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of an increasing variety of exoplanets in very close orbits\naround their host stars raised many questions about how stars and planets\ninteract, and to which extent host stars' properties may be influenced by the\npresence of close-by companions. Understanding how the evolution of stars is\nimpacted by the interactions with their planets is fundamental to disentangle\ntheir intrinsic evolution from Star-Planet Interactions (SPI)-induced\nphenomena. GJ 504 is a promising candidate for a star that underwent strong\nSPI. Its unusually short rotational period (3.4 days), while being in contrast\nwith what is expected by single-star models, could result from the inward\nmigration of a close-by, massive companion, pushed starward by tides. Moreover,\nits brighter X-ray luminosity may hint at a rejuvenation of the dynamo process\nsustaining the stellar magnetic field, consequent to the SPI-induced spin-up.\nWe aim to study the evolution of GJ 504 and establish whether by invoking the\nengulfment of a planetary companion we can better reproduce its rotational\nperiod and X-ray luminosity. We simulate the past evolution assuming two\ndifferent scenarios: 'Star without close-by planet', 'Star with close-by\nplanet'. In the second scenario, we investigate how inward migration and\nplanetary engulfment driven by tides spin up the stellar surface and rejuvenate\nits dynamo. We compare our tracks with rotational period and X-ray data\ncollected from the all-sky surveys of the ROentgen Survey with an Imaging\nTelescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Russian Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma mission\n(SRG). Despite the very uncertain stellar age, we found that the second\nevolutionary scenario is in better agreement with the short rotational period\nand the bright X-ray luminosity of GJ 504, thus strongly favouring the inward\nmigration scenario over the one in which close-by planets have no tidal impact\non the star.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have recently shown remarkable\nadvancements by integrating retrieval mechanisms into language models,\nenhancing their ability to produce more accurate and contextually relevant\nresponses. However, the influence of various components and configurations\nwithin RAG systems remains underexplored. A comprehensive understanding of\nthese elements is essential for tailoring RAG systems to complex retrieval\ntasks and ensuring optimal performance across diverse applications. In this\npaper, we develop several advanced RAG system designs that incorporate query\nexpansion, various novel retrieval strategies, and a novel Contrastive\nIn-Context Learning RAG. Our study systematically investigates key factors,\nincluding language model size, prompt design, document chunk size, knowledge\nbase size, retrieval stride, query expansion techniques, Contrastive In-Context\nLearning knowledge bases, multilingual knowledge bases, and Focus Mode\nretrieving relevant context at sentence-level. Through extensive\nexperimentation, we provide a detailed analysis of how these factors influence\nresponse quality. Our findings offer actionable insights for developing RAG\nsystems, striking a balance between contextual richness and\nretrieval-generation efficiency, thereby paving the way for more adaptable and\nhigh-performing RAG frameworks in diverse real-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in remote sensing applications,\nwhere the accurate extraction and representation of features are essential for\nhigh-quality results. Despite the widespread use of encoder-decoder\narchitectures, existing methods often struggle with fully utilizing the\nhigh-dimensional features extracted by the encoder and efficiently recovering\ndetailed information during decoding. To address these problems, we propose a\nnovel semantic segmentation network, namely DeepKANSeg, including two key\ninnovations based on the emerging Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN). Notably, the\nadvantage of KAN lies in its ability to decompose high-dimensional complex\nfunctions into univariate transformations, enabling efficient and flexible\nrepresentation of intricate relationships in data. First, we introduce a\nKAN-based deep feature refinement module, namely DeepKAN to effectively capture\ncomplex spatial and rich semantic relationships from high-dimensional features.\nSecond, we replace the traditional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers in the\nglobal-local combined decoder with KAN-based linear layers, namely GLKAN. This\nmodule enhances the decoder's ability to capture fine-grained details during\ndecoding. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are\nconducted on two well-known fine-resolution remote sensing benchmark datasets,\nnamely ISPRS Vaihingen and ISPRS Potsdam. The results demonstrate that the\nKAN-enhanced segmentation model achieves superior performance in terms of\naccuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. They highlight the potential of\nKANs as a powerful alternative to traditional architectures in semantic\nsegmentation tasks. Moreover, the explicit univariate decomposition provides\nimproved interpretability, which is particularly beneficial for applications\nrequiring explainable learning in remote sensing.",

This is of special relevance for quantum education, where various\nexternal representations are available and their effective use is recognised as\ncrucial to student learning. However, research on the effects of\ninformationally redundant external representations in quantum learning is\nlimited. The present study aims to contribute to the development of effective\nlearning materials by investigating the effects of learning with\ninformationally redundant external representations on students' learning of\nquantum physics. Using a between-subjects design, 113 students were randomly\nassigned to one of four learning conditions.

The three intervention groups received redundant\nessential information in the Dirac formalism, the Bloch sphere, or both. The\nuse of eye tracking enabled insight into the learning process depending on the\nexternal representations provided. While the results indicate no effect of the\nstudy condition on learning outcomes (content knowledge and cognitive load),\nthe analysis of visual behaviour reveals decreased learning efficiency with the\naddition of the Bloch sphere to the multimedia learning unit. The results are\ndiscussed based on current insight in learning with MERs.

To\nfacilitate the implementation of complex quantum algorithms on noisy hardware,\nwe propose an approximate method for compiling target quantum circuits into\nbrick-wall layouts. This new circuit design consists of two-qubit CNOT gates\nthat can be directly implemented on real quantum computers, in conjunction with\noptimized one-qubit gates, to approximate the essential dynamics of the\noriginal circuit while significantly reducing its depth. Our approach is\nevaluated through numerical simulations of time-evolution circuits for the\ncritical Ising model, quantum Fourier transformation, and Haar-random quantum\ncircuits, as well as experiments on IBM quantum platforms. By accounting for\ncompilation error and circuit noise, we demonstrate that time evolution and\nquantum Fourier transformation circuits achieve high compression rates, while\nrandom quantum circuits are less compressible. The degree of compression is\nrelated to the rate of entanglement accumulation in the target circuit. In\nparticular, experiments on IBM platforms achieve a compression rate of $12.5$\nfor $N=12$, significantly extending the application of current quantum devices.\nFurthermore, large-scale numerical simulations for system sizes up to $N=30$\nreveal that the optimal depth $d_{\\rm max}$ to achieve maximal overall fidelity\nis independent of system size $N$, suggesting the scalability of our method for\nlarge quantum devices in terms of quantum resources.",

The concomitant observation of gravitational wave and\nelectromagnetic signals from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger in 2017\nconfirmed that these events can produce relativistic jets responsible for short\nGamma-Ray Bursts (sGRBs). The complex interaction between the jet and the\nsurrounding post-merger environment shapes the angular structure of the\noutflow, which is then imprinted in the prompt and afterglow sGRB emission.\nAims. The outcome of relativistic (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations of jets\npiercing through post-merger environments is often used as input to compute\nafterglow signals to be compared with observations. However, for reliable\ncomparisons, the jet propagation should be followed until nearly ballistic\nregimes, in which the jet acceleration is essentially over and the angular\nstructure is no longer evolving. This condition is typically reached in 2D\nsimulations, but not in 3D.

Our work is based on a previous 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic jet simulation employing a realistic environment imported\nfrom a BNS merger simulation, extended here far beyond the evolution time\noriginally covered.

As it is standard in the framework of Morse theory, the\ntopological types are captured by the C-index and the quadratic index,\nrespectively.

This capability is referred to as continual\nlearning, which focuses on the ability to learn a sequence of tasks without the\ndetriment of previous knowledge. A prevalent strategy to tackle continual\nlearning involves selecting and storing numerous essential data samples from\nprior tasks within a fixed-size memory buffer. However, the majority of current\nmemory-based techniques typically utilize a single memory buffer, which poses\nchallenges in concurrently managing newly acquired and previously learned\nsamples.

Here, we further characterize Sabra blowups by\nimplementing two strategies targeting the eigenvalue problem. The first\ninvolves formal expansion in terms of the bookkeeping parameter $\\delta =\n(1-x)\\log \\lambda$, and interpretes the self-similar solution as a (degenerate)\nhomoclinic bifurcation. Using standard bifurcation toolkits, we show that the\nhomoclinic bifurcations identified under finite-truncation of the series\nconverge to the observed Sabra solution. The second strategy uses\nmachine-learning optimization to solve directly for the Sabra eigenvalue. It\nreveals an intricate phase space, with the presence of a continuous family of\nnon-universal blowup profiles, characterized by various number $N$ of pulses\nand exponents $x_N\\ge x$.",

Recent applications reveal that\nthe subset site selection coupled with continuous angular parameter\noptimization can be formulated as Mixed-Variable Optimization Problems (MVOPs).\nMeanwhile, high-fidelity discretization and visibility analysis significantly\nincrease computational cost and complexity, evolving the MVOP into an Expensive\nMixed-Variable Optimization Problem (EMVOP). While canonical Evolutionary\nAlgorithms have yielded promising results, their reliance on numerous fitness\nevaluations is too costly for our problem.

To\naddress these issues, we propose the RankNet-Inspired Surrogate-assisted Hybrid\nMetaheuristic (RI-SHM), an extension of our previous work. RI-SHM integrates\nthree key components: (1) a RankNet-based pairwise global surrogate that\ninnovatively predicts rankings between pairs of individuals, bypassing the\nchallenges of fitness estimation in discontinuous solution space; (2) a\nsurrogate-assisted local Estimation of Distribution Algorithm that enhances\nlocal exploitation and helps escape from local optima; and (3) a fitness\ndiversity-driven switching strategy that dynamically balances exploration and\nexploitation.

In this paper, we revisit a\nsolution to this problem that was considered in the past but is not being used\nin modern software: sidereal visibility averaging (SVA). This technique\ncombines individual observations taken at different sidereal days into one much\nsmaller dataset by averaging visibilities at similar baseline coordinates. We\npresent our method and validated it using four separate 8-hour observations of\nthe ELAIS-N1 deep field, taken with the International LOw Frequency ARray\n(LOFAR) Telescope (ILT) at 140~MHz. Additionally, we assessed the accuracy\nconstraints imposed by Earth's orbital motion relative to the observed pointing\nwhen combining multiple datasets. We find, with four observations, data volume\nreductions of a factor of 1.8 and computational time improvements of a factor\nof 1.6 compared to standard imaging. These factors will increase when more\nobservations are combined with SVA. For instance, with 3000~hours of LOFAR data\naimed at achieving sensitivities of the order of {\\mu}Jy/beam at sub-arcsecond\nresolutions, we estimate data volume reductions of up to a factor of 169 and a\n14-fold decrease in computing time using our current algorithm.

    "abstract": "We introduce several families of entanglement-assisted (EA)\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes derived from two distinct classes of\nlow-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We derive two families of EA quantum\nQC-LDPC codes, namely, the spatially coupled (SC) and the non-spatially coupled\ncases. These two families are constructed by tiling permutation matrices of\nprime and composite orders. We establish several code properties along with\nconditions for guaranteed girth for the proposed code families. The Tanner\ngraphs of the proposed EA quantum QC-LDPC and EA quantum QC-SC-LDPC codes have\ngirths greater than four, which is required for good error correction\nperformance. Some of the proposed families of codes require only\n\\textit{minimal} Bell pairs to be shared across the quantum transceiver.\nFurthermore, we construct two families of EA quantum QC-LDPC codes based on a\nsingle classical code, with Tanner graphs having girths greater than six,\nfurther improving the error correction performance. We evaluate the performance\nof these codes using both depolarizing and Markovian noise models to assess the\nrandom and burst error performance. Using a modified version of the sum-product\nalgorithm over a quaternary alphabet, we show how correlated Pauli errors can\nbe handled within the decoding setup. Simulation results show that nearly an\norder of improvement in the error correction performance can be achieved with\nquaternary decoder compared to binary decoder over the depolarizing and\nMarkovian error channels, thereby generalizing the approach of EA quantum\nQC-LDPC code designs to work with both random and burst quantum error models,\nuseful in practice.",

EP can perform quick characterisation of transients or\noutbursts with a Wolter-I X-ray telescope onboard. In this paper, the science\nobjectives of the Einstein Probe mission are presented.

Among them, fast extragalactic\ntransients will be surveyed systematically in soft X-rays, which include\n{\\gamma}-ray bursts and their variants, supernova shock breakouts, and the\npredicted X-ray transients associated with binary neutron star mergers. EP will\ndetect X-ray tidal disruption events and outbursts from active galactic nuclei,\npossibly at an early phase of the flares for some. EP will monitor the\nvariability and outbursts of X-rays from white dwarfs, neutron stars and black\nholes in our and neighbouring galaxies at flux levels fainter than those\ndetectable by the current instruments, and is expected to discover new objects.\nA large sample of stellar X-ray flares will also be detected and characterised.\nIn the era of multi-messenger astronomy, EP has the potential of detecting the\npossible X-ray counterparts of gravitational wave events, neutrino sources, and\nultra-high energy {\\gamma}-ray and cosmic ray sources.

    "abstract": "There is a possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark matter,\nand this interaction may also undergo a sign change during the evolution of the\nuniverse. In this paper, we utilize the latest observational data to constrain\nmodels of a sign-changeable interaction. The data we employ, in addition to the\ncosmic microwave background data, also encompass the first-year baryon acoustic\noscillation data from DESI and the type Ia supernova data of the full 5-year\nobservation from DES. To achieve high generality, we investigate four\ninteracting dark energy (IDE) models with different forms of the interaction\nterm $Q$: (i) IDE1 with $Q = \\beta(a)H\\rho_{\\rm de}$; (ii) IDE2 with $Q =\n\\beta(a)H\\rho_{\\rm c}$; (iii) IDE3 with $Q = \\beta(a)H_0\\rho_{\\rm de}$; (iv)\nIDE4 with $Q = \\beta(a)H_0\\rho_{\\rm c}$. From the analysis, we observe that\n$\\beta(z) > 0$ at early times and $\\beta(z) < 0$ at late times, with the\ncoupling $\\beta(z)$ crossing the non-interacting line $\\beta(z) = 0$ during\ncosmic evolution at the 2$\\sigma$ confidence level for the IDE1, IDE3, and IDE4\nmodels. However, for the IDE2 model, $\\beta(z)$ remains consistently negative\nand does not cross $\\beta(z) = 0$ at the 2$\\sigma$ confidence level. Our\nfindings indicate that the energy transfer is from dark matter to dark energy\nwhen dark matter dominates the universe, and from dark energy to dark matter\nwhen dark energy dominates, for the IDE1 and IDE3 models. Furthermore, Bayesian\nevidence suggests that the IDE1 and IDE3 models are moderately preferred over\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM model. The overall outcomes of this study clearly indicate\nthat, based on current observational data, the sign-changeable IDE models are\nquite compelling and merit further attention.",

However,\nforestry operations such as harvesting, handling and measuring logs still\nrequire substantial human labor in remote environments posing significant\nsafety risks. Progressively automating these tasks has the potential of\nincreasing their efficiency as well as safety, but requires an accurate\ndetection of individual logs as well as live trees and their context. Although\ninitial approaches have been proposed for this challenging application domain,\nspecialized data and algorithms are still too scarce to develop robust\nsolutions. To mitigate this gap, we introduce the TimberVision dataset,\nconsisting of more than 2k annotated RGB images containing a total of 51k trunk\ncomponents including cut and lateral surfaces, thereby surpassing any existing\ndataset in this domain in terms of both quantity and detail by a large margin.\nBased on this data, we conduct a series of ablation experiments for oriented\nobject detection and instance segmentation and evaluate the influence of\nmultiple scene parameters on model performance. We introduce a generic\nframework to fuse the components detected by our models for both tasks into\nunified trunk representations. Furthermore, we automatically derive geometric\nproperties and apply multi-object tracking to further enhance robustness. Our\ndetection and tracking approach provides highly descriptive and accurate trunk\nrepresentations solely from RGB image data, even under challenging\nenvironmental conditions.

    ],
    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) architectures are often described as functionally\nhierarchical: Early layers process syntax, middle layers begin to parse\nsemantics, and late layers integrate information. The present work revisits\nthese ideas. This research submits simple texts to an LLM (e.g., \"A church and\norgan\") and extracts the resulting activations. Then, for each layer, support\nvector machines and ridge regressions are fit to predict a text's label and\nthus examine whether a given layer encodes some information. Analyses using a\nsmall model (Llama-3.2-3b; 28 layers) partly bolster the common hierarchical\nperspective: Item-level semantics are most strongly represented early (layers\n2-7), then two-item relations (layers 8-12), and then four-item analogies\n(layers 10-15). Afterward, the representation of items and simple relations\ngradually decreases in deeper layers that focus on more global information.\nHowever, several findings run counter to a steady hierarchy view: First,\nalthough deep layers can represent document-wide abstractions, deep layers also\ncompress information from early portions of the context window without\nmeaningful abstraction. Second, when examining a larger model\n(Llama-3.3-70b-Instruct), stark fluctuations in abstraction level appear: As\ndepth increases, two-item relations and four-item analogies initially increase\nin their representation, then markedly decrease, and afterward increase again\nmomentarily. This peculiar pattern consistently emerges across several\nexperiments. Third, another emergent effect of scaling is coordination between\nthe attention mechanisms of adjacent layers. Across multiple experiments using\nthe larger model, adjacent layers fluctuate between what information they each\nspecialize in representing. In sum, an abstraction hierarchy often manifests\nacross layers, but large models also deviate from this structure in curious\nways.",

The various geometry and design\nparameters of SNSPDs are often carefully tailored to specific applications,\nresulting in challenges in optimising each performance characteristic without\nadversely impacting others. In particular, when scaling to larger array\nformats, the key challenge is to manage the heat load generated by the many\nreadout cables in the cryogenic cooling system. Here we demonstrate a\npractical, self-contained 64-pixel SNSPD array system which exhibits high\nperformance of all operational parameters, for use in the strategically\nimportant SWIR spectral region. The detector is an 8x8 array of 27.5 x 27.8\n{\\mu}m pixels on a 30 {\\mu}m pitch, which leads to an 80 -- 85% fill factor. At\na wavelength of 1550nm, a uniform average per-pixel photon detection efficiency\nof 77.7% was measured and the observed system detection efficiency (SDE) across\nthe entire array was 65%. A full performance characterisation is presented,\nincluding a dark count rate of 20 cps per pixel, full-width-half-maximum (FWHM)\njitter of 100 ps per pixel, a 3-dB maximum count rate of 645 Mcps and no\nevidence of crosstalk at the 0.1% level.

Using added-value products of the Calar Alto\nVoid Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY) and SDSS DR16 images, we examine\nthe effect of large-scale environments on the stellar mass-size relation. We\nanalyse the Petrosian R50 and R90 radii of approximately 140000 galaxies in\nvoids, filaments, and clusters, with a mass range of $10^{8.5} - 10^{11}\nM_{\\odot}$. We explore the relation in terms of galaxy morphology and star\nformation history, parametrised by T50, T70, and T90. We find that early-type\nvoid galaxies are, on average, 10-20% smaller than their counterparts in denser\nenvironments, regardless of their mass assembly history. Moreover, the\nmass-size relation for massive early-type void galaxies has a shallower slope\ncompared to those in denser regions. In contrast, early-type galaxies in\nfilaments, and clusters show a more uniform mass-size relation. Late-type\ncluster galaxies with stellar masses $log(M_{\\star} / M_{\\odot}) = 9 - 10.5$\nare smaller and more concentrated than their counterparts in lower-density\nenvironments, such as filaments, and voids. We conclude that large-scale\nenvironments influence the mass-size relation. Early-type galaxies appear to\ngrow most of their mass during the initial formation phase. Subsequent size\ngrowth in voids is less significant, likely due to slower evolution, reduced\nminor merger activity, fewer accretion events, or a combination. The flatter\nslope for massive void galaxies indicates a lower rate of minor accretion, a\ntrend also observed in late-type void galaxies with $\\approx 10^{10.5}\nM_{\\odot}$, where minor mergers contribute to size growth. Conversely,\nlate-type quenched cluster galaxies are smaller due to environmental\ninteractions, with early infallers being most affected.",

We also perform a detailed Monte-Carlo simulation\nof the channel $pp \\to t S +j$ with $S \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ and $S \\to b \\bar b$,\nand investigate the LHC sensitivity to the $tcS$ couplings. It is found that\nthe scalar singlet $S$ can induce scalar-type contributions to the $B_s \\to\n\\mu^+ \\mu^-$ decay, which do not suffer from the helicity suppression and\ncontain a large CKM factor $V_{cs}^*V_{tb}$. As a result, constraints on the\n$tcS$ couplings from the measured branching ratio $\\mathcal{B}(B_s \\to \\mu^+\n\\mu^-)$ are quite stringent, being even stronger than the expected LHC\nsensitivity in some parameter spaces. Besides the CP-conserving $tcS$\ncouplings, we have also considered the case of CP-violating $tcS$ couplings,\nwith $y_{R,L}^{ct}=|y_{R,L}^{ct}|e^{i\\theta_{R,L}}$.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal language model has made advanced progress in vision and audio,\nbut still faces significant challenges in dealing with complex reasoning tasks\nin the time series domain. The reasons are twofold. First, labels for\nmulti-modal time series data are coarse and devoid of analysis or reasoning\nprocesses. Training with these data cannot improve the model's reasoning\ncapabilities. Second, due to the lack of precise tokenization in processing\ntime series, the representation patterns for temporal and textual information\nare inconsistent, which hampers the effectiveness of multi-modal alignment. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a multi-modal time series data\nconstruction approach and a multi-modal time series language model (TLM),\nTempoGPT. Specially, we construct multi-modal data for complex reasoning tasks\nby analyzing the variable-system relationships within a white-box system.\nAdditionally, proposed TempoGPT achieves consistent representation between\ntemporal and textual information by quantizing temporal embeddings, where\ntemporal embeddings are quantized into a series of discrete tokens using a\npredefined codebook; subsequently, a shared embedding layer processes both\ntemporal and textual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempoGPT\naccurately perceives temporal information, logically infers conclusions, and\nachieves state-of-the-art in the constructed complex time series reasoning\ntasks. Moreover, we quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of quantizing\ntemporal embeddings in enhancing multi-modal alignment and the reasoning\ncapabilities of TLMs. Code and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/zhanghaochuan20/TempoGPT.",

To explore the mapping\nrelationship between physical environment and electromagnetic space, a new V2V\nhigh-fidelity mixed sensing-communication integration simulation dataset with\ndifferent vehicular traffic densities (VTDs) is constructed. Based on the\nconstructed dataset, a novel scatterer recognition (ScaR) algorithm utilizing\nneural network SegNet is developed to recognize scatterer spatial attributes\nfrom LiDAR point clouds via SoM. In the developed ScaR algorithm, the mapping\nrelationship between LiDAR point clouds and scatterers is explored, where the\ndistribution of scatterers is obtained in the form of grid maps. Furthermore,\nscatterers are distinguished into dynamic and static scatterers based on LiDAR\npoint cloud features, where parameters, e.g., distance, angle, and number,\nrelated to scatterers are determined. Through ScaR, dynamic and static\nscatterers change with the variation of LiDAR point clouds over time, which\nprecisely models channel non-stationarity and consistency under different VTDs.\nSome important channel statistical properties, such as time-frequency\ncorrelation function (TF-CF) and Doppler power spectral density (DPSD), are\nobtained. Simulation results match well with ray-tracing (RT)-based results,\nthus demonstrating the necessity of exploring the mapping relationship and the\nutility of the proposed model.",

However, the duration of\nthis intrinsic memory is limited by synaptic and membrane time constants.\nDelays are a powerful additional mechanism and, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel event-based training method for SNNs with delays, grounded in the\nEventProp formalism which enables the calculation of exact gradients with\nrespect to weights and delays. Our method supports multiple spikes per neuron\nand, to the best of our knowledge, is the first delay learning algorithm to be\napplied to recurrent SNNs.

First, we consider the\ndownlink multiuser communication, where each user is randomly distributed\nwithin a given three-dimensional zone with local movement. To reduce the\noverhead of frequent antenna movement, the antenna position vector (APV) is\ndesigned based on users' statistical channel state information (CSI), so that\nthe antennas only need to be moved in a large timescale. Then, for target\nsensing, the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) of the estimation mean square error for\ndifferent spatial angles of arrival (AoAs) are derived as functions of MAs'\npositions. Based on the above, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize\nthe expected minimum achievable rate among all communication users, with given\nconstraints on the maximum acceptable CRB thresholds for target sensing. An\nalternating optimization algorithm is proposed to iteratively optimize one of\nthe horizontal and vertical APVs of the MA array with the other being fixed.\nNumerical results demonstrate that our proposed MA arrays can significantly\nenlarge the trade-off region between communication and sensing performance\ncompared to conventional FPA arrays with different inter-antenna spacing.

Such a steady\nstate, sustained by a balance between driving and dissipation, could be a\ntextbook example for a nonequilibrium situation. Nevertheless, most theoretical\ndescriptions of spin-torque oscillators simply assume local equilibrium. Here,\nbased on a simple model, we investigate the relevance of nonequilibrium effects\nin spin-torque oscillators. We use a nonequilibrium Keldysh description, which\nallows us to treat the effects of spin relaxation, and find that, in the\nabsence of spin relaxation, persistent precessions of the magnetization are not\nallowed, if magnetic anisotropies are absent. However, introducing spin\nrelaxation enables persistent precessions, where the strength of the spin\nrelaxation has quantitative and qualitative effects on the magnetization\ndynamics. In the presence of magnetic anisotropy, we find that persistent\nprecessions are allowed even if spin relaxation is absent, but spin relaxation\ncauses a nonlinear relation between the oscillator power and the applied\nvoltage bias. Finally, we consider an alternative spin relaxation mechanism and\nstudy the resulting magnetization precessions, highlighting the importance of\nunderstanding the exact nature of the relaxation in nanomagnets.",

This would make competition keener\nthroughout a match and probably decrease the need for a GT, because the game\nand set winner would more likely coincide when the players fight hard for every\npoint.",

Conversely, differential phase\ncontrast (DPC) offers fast imaging but is limited in resolution. Here, we\nintroduce perturbative Fourier ptychographic microscopy (pFPM). pFPM is an\nextension of DPC that incorporates dark-field illumination to enable fast,\nhigh-resolution, wide-field quantitative phase imaging with few measurements.\nWe interpret DPC as the initial iteration of a Gauss-Newton algorithm with\nquadratic regularization and generalize it to multiple iterations and more\nsophisticated regularizers. This broader framework is not restricted to\nbright-field measurements and allows us to overcome resolution limitations of\nDPC. We develop tailored annular dark-field illumination patterns that align\nwith the perturbative interpretation and lead to an improvement in the quality\nof reconstruction with respect to other common illumination schemes.\nConsequently, our methodology combines an enhanced phase reconstruction\nalgorithm with a specialized illumination strategy and offers significant\nadvantages in both imaging speed and resolution.",

While commendable results have been demonstrated by existing\ntransformer-based approaches, predicting the accurate temporal span of the\ntarget moment is still a major challenge. This paper reveals that a crucial\nreason stems from the spurious correlation between the text query and the\nmoment context. Namely, the model makes predictions by overly associating\nqueries with background frames rather than distinguishing target moments. To\naddress this issue, we propose a dynamic learning approach for moment\nretrieval, where two strategies are designed to mitigate the spurious\ncorrelation. First, we introduce a novel video synthesis approach to construct\na dynamic context for the queried moment, enabling the model to attend to the\ntarget moment of the corresponding query across dynamic backgrounds. Second, to\nalleviate the over-association with backgrounds, we enhance representations\ntemporally by incorporating text-dynamics interaction, which encourages the\nmodel to align text with target moments through complementary dynamic\nrepresentations. With the proposed method, our model significantly alleviates\nthe spurious correlation issue in moment retrieval and establishes new\nstate-of-the-art performance on two popular benchmarks, \\ie, QVHighlights and\nCharades-STA. In addition, detailed ablation studies and evaluations across\ndifferent architectures demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of the\nproposed strategies.

In this paper,\nthrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate that commonly used Monte Carlo\n(MC) estimation-based data synthesis for PRMs typically yields inferior\nperformance and generalization compared to LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation\nmethods. MC estimation relies on completion models to evaluate current-step\ncorrectness, leading to inaccurate step verification. Furthermore, we identify\npotential biases in conventional Best-of-N (BoN) evaluation strategies for\nPRMs: (1) The unreliable policy models generate responses with correct answers\nbut flawed processes, leading to a misalignment between the evaluation criteria\nof BoN and the PRM objectives of process verification. (2) The tolerance of\nPRMs of such responses leads to inflated BoN scores. (3) Existing PRMs have a\nsignificant proportion of minimum scores concentrated on the final answer\nsteps, revealing the shift from process to outcome-based assessment in BoN\nOptimized PRMs. To address these challenges, we develop a consensus filtering\nmechanism that effectively integrates MC estimation with LLM-as-a-judge and\nadvocates a more comprehensive evaluation framework that combines\nresponse-level and step-level metrics. Based on the mechanisms, we\nsignificantly improve both model performance and data efficiency in the BoN\nevaluation and the step-wise error identification task.

While these methods have made significant advancements in\nidentifying the contours of camouflaged objects, they may be inefficient or\ncost-effective for tasks that only require the specific location of the object.\nObject detection algorithms offer an optimized solution for Realistic\nCamouflaged Object Detection (RCOD) in such cases.

Unlike\nsegmentation methods that perform pixel-wise comparisons to differentiate\nbetween foreground and background, object detectors omit this analysis, further\naggravating the challenge. To solve this problem, we propose a camouflage-aware\nfeature refinement (CAFR) strategy. Since camouflaged objects are not rare\ncategories, CAFR fully utilizes a clear perception of the current object within\nthe prior knowledge of large models to assist detectors in deeply understanding\nthe distinctions between background and foreground.

The designed measurement and feedback operators induce an\neffective dissipative channel that stabilizes the desired insulator state,\neither in an exact way or approximately in the case where additional\nexperimental constraints are assumed. Successful state preparation is\ndemonstrated in one-dimensional insulators as well as for Haldane's Chern\ninsulator, by calculating the fidelity between the target ground state and the\nsteady state of the feedback-modified master equation. The fidelity is obtained\nnumerically through exact diagonalization or via time evolution of the system\nwith moderate sizes.

    "abstract": "Quantum relative entropy, a quantum generalization of the well-known\nKullback-Leibler divergence, serves as a fundamental measure of the\ndistinguishability between quantum states and plays a pivotal role in quantum\ninformation science. Despite its importance, efficiently estimating quantum\nrelative entropy between two quantum states on quantum computers remains a\nsignificant challenge. In this work, we propose the first quantum algorithm for\nestimating quantum relative entropy and Petz R\\'{e}nyi divergence from two\nunknown quantum states on quantum computers, addressing open problems\nhighlighted in [Phys. Rev. A 109, 032431 (2024)] and [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory\n70, 5653-5680 (2024)]. This is achieved by combining quadrature approximations\nof relative entropies, the variational representation of quantum f-divergences,\nand a new technique for parameterizing Hermitian polynomial operators to\nestimate their traces with quantum states. Notably, the circuit size of our\nalgorithm is at most 2n+1 with n being the number of qubits in the quantum\nstates and it is directly applicable to distributed scenarios, where quantum\nstates to be compared are hosted on cross-platform quantum computers. We\nvalidate our algorithm through numerical simulations, laying the groundwork for\nits future deployment on quantum hardware devices.",

We estimate an age of\n$\\sim0.9$ Gyr and a sub-solar metallicity (between $-0.4$ and $-0.2$ dex). We\nfind generally consistent results when fitting the optical and NIR wavelength\nranges separately or using different model libraries. The reconstruction of the\nstar formation history indicates that the galaxy assembled most of its mass\nquickly and then rapidly quenched, $\\sim0.4$ Gyr prior to observation. Line\ndiagnostics suggest that the weak emission is probably powered by residual star\nformation (SFR$\\sim0.2$M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) or a low-luminosity AGN, with no\nstrong evidence for outflows in ionized or neutral gas. We perform a detailed\nstudy of the NIR spectral indices by comparing observations with predictions of\nseveral state-of-the-art stellar population models. This is unprecedented at\nsuch a high redshift. In particular, the analysis of several CO and CN features\nargues against a heavy contribution of Thermally Pulsating (TP-)AGB stars.\nObservations align better with models that include a minimal contribution from\nTP-AGB stars, but they are also consistent with a mild contribution from TP-AGB\nstars, assuming a younger age (consistent with the fits). The analysis of other\nNIR spectral indices shows that current models struggle to reproduce\nobservations. This highlights the need for improved stellar population models\nin the NIR, especially at young ages and low metallicities, which is most\nrelevant for studying high redshift galaxies in the JWST era.",

Five out of the six pair systems have secure detections\nof HI emissions (signal-to-noise ratio > 10). The HI fraction and star\nformation efficiency of the six pairs do not deviate from isolated galaxies.\nFor the HI line profiles, common unique asymmetry is observed, indicating\ndisturbances on the atomic gas from the galaxy interaction. The global\nH$\\alpha$ spectra of the merger systems are constructed from the optical\nintegral field spectroscopic observations, by integrating the flux in\ncorresponding line-of-sight velocity bins. The H$\\alpha$ spectra tend to show\nmultiple components in the pre-merger phase, and single component line profiles\nin the post-merger systems, while all HI spectra show single component line\nprofiles regardless of merger stages. The HI and H$\\alpha$ spectra show offsets\nin the central velocities, which appear to decrease from >100 km/s in the\npre-merger pair to <10 km/s in post-merger pairs.

We highlight how these pillars collectively enable\ncontinuous adaptation, mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and improve long-term\nperformance. This survey provides a roadmap for researchers and practitioners\nworking to develop lifelong learning capabilities in LLM agents, offering\ninsights into emerging trends, evaluation metrics, and application scenarios.\nRelevant literature and resources are available at \\href{this\nurl}{https://github.com/qianlima-lab/awesome-lifelong-llm-agent}.",

However, ML models can be vulnerable to external attacks,\ncausing them to underperform or deviate from their expected tasks. One way to\nattack ML models is by injecting malicious data to mislead the algorithm during\nthe training phase, which is referred to as a poisoning attack. We can prepare\nfor such situations by designing anticipated attacks, which are later used for\ncreating and testing defence strategies. In this paper, we propose an algorithm\nto generate strong poisoning attacks for a ridge regression model containing\nboth numerical and categorical features that explicitly models and poisons\ncategorical features. We model categorical features as SOS-1 sets and formulate\nthe problem of designing poisoning attacks as a bilevel optimization problem\nthat is nonconvex mixed-integer in the upper-level and unconstrained convex\nquadratic in the lower-level. We present the mathematical formulation of the\nproblem, introduce a single-level reformulation based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker\n(KKT) conditions of the lower level, find bounds for the lower-level variables\nto accelerate solver performance, and propose a new algorithm to poison\ncategorical features.

Due to the challenging real-world conditions, this\ntask usually demands complex models that process multi-modal data to achieve\nacceptable performance. We propose a unique neural model, leveraging advances\nfrom the state space and diffusion generative modeling to achieve remarkable 3D\nsemantic scene completion performance with monocular image input. Our technique\nprocesses the data in the conditioned latent space of a variational autoencoder\nwhere diffusion modeling is carried out with an innovative state space\ntechnique. A key component of our neural network is the proposed Skimba (Skip\nMamba) denoiser, which is adept at efficiently processing long-sequence data.\nThe Skimba diffusion model is integral to our 3D scene completion network,\nincorporating a triple Mamba structure, dimensional decomposition residuals and\nvarying dilations along three directions. We also adopt a variant of this\nnetwork for the subsequent semantic segmentation stage of our method. Extensive\nevaluation on the standard SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 datasets show\nthat our approach not only outperforms other monocular techniques by a large\nmargin, it also achieves competitive performance against stereo methods.

Given the inherent limitations of standalone\nsensors, integrating heterogeneous sensors with complementary capabilities is\none of the most effective approaches to achieving this goal. In this paper, we\npropose a filtering-based, tightly coupled global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS)-visual-inertial positioning framework with a pose-only formulation\napplied to the visual-inertial system (VINS), termed PO-GVINS. Specifically,\nmultiple-view imaging used in current VINS requires a priori of 3D feature,\nthen jointly estimate camera poses and 3D feature position, which inevitably\nintroduces linearization error of the feature as well as facing dimensional\nexplosion. However, the pose-only (PO) formulation, which is demonstrated to be\nequivalent to the multiple-view imaging and has been applied in visual\nreconstruction, represent feature depth using two camera poses and thus 3D\nfeature position is removed from state vector avoiding aforementioned\ndifficulties. Inspired by this, we first apply PO formulation in our VINS,\ni.e., PO-VINS. GNSS raw measurements are then incorporated with integer\nambiguity resolved to achieve accurate and drift-free estimation. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed PO-VINS significantly outperforms the\nmulti-state constrained Kalman filter (MSCKF). By incorporating GNSS\nmeasurements, PO-GVINS achieves accurate, drift-free state estimation, making\nit a robust solution for positioning in challenging environments.",

In this paper, we aim at making SAM 2 much\nmore efficient so that it even runs on mobile devices while maintaining a\ncomparable performance. Despite several works optimizing SAM for better\nefficiency, we find they are not sufficient for SAM 2 because they all focus on\ncompressing the image encoder, while our benchmark shows that the newly\nintroduced memory attention blocks are also the latency bottleneck. Given this\nobservation, we propose EdgeTAM, which leverages a novel 2D Spatial Perceiver\nto reduce the computational cost. In particular, the proposed 2D Spatial\nPerceiver encodes the densely stored frame-level memories with a lightweight\nTransformer that contains a fixed set of learnable queries. Given that video\nsegmentation is a dense prediction task, we find preserving the spatial\nstructure of the memories is essential so that the queries are split into\nglobal-level and patch-level groups. We also propose a distillation pipeline\nthat further improves the performance without inference overhead. As a result,\nEdgeTAM achieves 87.7, 70.0, 72.3, and 71.7 J&F on DAVIS 2017, MOSE, SA-V val,\nand SA-V test, while running at 16 FPS on iPhone 15 Pro Max.",

First, we analyze the scenario where the dispersive\nand flat bands intersect at two points, and the atomic frequency lies within\nthe band. Unlike the small atom, which simultaneously interacts with both\nbands, a single giant atom with a controllable phase interacts exclusively with\nthe dispersive or flat band. Second, in the bandgap regime, where two atoms\ninteract through bound-state overlaps manifesting as dipole-dipole\ninteractions, we demonstrate that giant atoms enable deterministic long-range\nhopping and energy exchange with higher fidelity compared to small atoms.

    "abstract": "Social institutions are systems of shared norms and rules that regulate\npeople's behaviors, often emerging without external enforcement. They provide\ncriteria to distinguish cooperation from defection and establish rules to\nsustain cooperation, shaped through long-term trial and error. While principles\nfor successful institutions have been proposed, the mechanisms underlying their\nemergence remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce the evolutionary\ndynamical-systems game, a framework that couples game actions with\nenvironmental dynamics and explores the evolution of cognitive frameworks for\ndecision-making. We analyze a minimal model of common-pool resource management,\nwhere resources grow naturally and are harvested. Players use decision-making\nfunctions to determine whether to harvest at each step, based on environmental\nand peer monitoring. As these functions evolve, players detect selfish\nharvesting and punish it by degrading the environment through harvesting. This\nprocess leads to the self-organization of norms that classify harvesting\nactions as cooperative, defective, or punitive. The emergent norms for\n``cooperativeness'' and rules of punishment serve as institutions. The\nenvironmental and players' states converge to distinct modes characterized by\nlimit-cycles, representing temporal regularities in socio-ecological systems.\nThese modes remain stable despite slight variations in decision-making,\nillustrating the stability of institutions. The evolutionary robustness of\ndecision-making functions serves as a measure of the evolutionary favorability\nof institutions, highlighting the role of plasticity in responding to diverse\nopponents.

During extrusion processing of\nPLA, in-line NIR spectra were captured along with extrusion process and machine\nsetting data. With a dataset comprising 63 observations and 512 input features,\nappropriate machine learning tools are essential for interpreting data and\nselecting features to improve prediction accuracy. Initially, the ABC\noptimization algorithm is coupled with ANN/ANFIS to forecast PLA molecular\nweight. The objective functions of the ABC algorithm are to minimize the root\nmean square error (RMSE) between experimental and predicted PLA molecular\nweights while also minimizing the number of input features. Results indicate\nthat employing ABC-ANFIS yields the lowest RMSE of 282 Da and identifies four\nsignificant parameters (NIR wavenumbers 6158 cm-1, 6310 cm-1, 6349 cm-1, and\nmelt temperature) for prediction. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness\nof using the ABC algorithm with ANFIS for selecting a minimal set of features\nto predict PLA molecular weight with high accuracy during processing",

    "abstract": "Collectively-encoded qubits, involving ensembles of atomic or solid-state\nemitters, present many practical advantages for quantum technologies. However,\nthey suffer from uncontrolled inhomogeneous dephasing which couples them to a\nquasi-continuum of dark states. In most cases, this process cannot be\nencompassed in a standard master equation with time-independent coefficients,\nmaking its description either tedious or inaccurate. We show that it can be\nunderstood as a displacement in time-frequency phase space and accurately\nincluded in resource-efficient numerical simulations of the qubit's dynamics.\nThis description unveils a regime where the qubit becomes protected from\ndephasing through a combination of strong driving and non-Markovianity. We\nexperimentally investigate this regime using a Rydberg superatom and extend its\ncoherent dynamics beyond the inhomogeneous-dephasing characteristic time by an\norder of magnitude.",

In this work, we perform numerical analysis to show that QSCI\nmethods face critical limitations that severely hinder their practical\napplicability in chemistry. Using the nitrogen molecule and the iron-sulfur\ncluster [2Fe-2S] as examples, we demonstrate that while QSCI can, in principle,\nyield high-quality configuration interaction (CI) expansions similar to\nclassical SCI heuristics in some cases, the method struggles with\ninefficiencies in finding new determinants as sampling repeatedly selects\nalready seen configurations. This inefficiency becomes especially pronounced\nwhen targeting high-accuracy results or sampling from an approximate ansatz. In\ncases where the sampling problem is not present, the resulting CI expansions\nare less compact than those generated from classical heuristics, rendering QSCI\nan overall more expensive method. Our findings suggest a significant drawback\nin QSCI methods when sampling from the ground-state distribution as the\ninescapable trade-off between finding sufficiently many determinants and\ngenerating compact, accurate CI expansions.

In this work, we expand the\nstudy of electron glasses to a well-known quantum paraelectric SrTiO$_3$ (STO)\nand unveil a new scenario: how naturally occurring ferroelastic twin walls of\nSTO could result in glassy electrons, even in a metallic state. We show that\nthe emergent two-dimensional electron gas at the $\\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/STO\ninterface exhibits long-lasting temporal relaxations in resistance and memory\neffects at low temperatures, which are hallmarks of glassiness. We also\ndemonstrate that the glass-like relaxations could be further tuned by\napplication of an electric field. This implies that the observed glassy\ndynamics is connected with the development of polarity near the structural twin\nwalls of STO and the complex interactions among them, arising from the coupling\nbetween ferroelastic and ferroelectric orders. The observation of this glassy\nmetal phase not only extends the concept of electron glasses to metallic\nsystems with multiple order parameters but also contributes to the growing\nunderstanding of the fascinating and diverse physical phenomena that emerge\nnear the quantum critical point.",

However, it exhibits limitations in its scope,\nprimarily executed in a question-answering paradigm and focusing on brief video\nsegments containing isolated events and basic causal relations, lacking\ncomprehensive and structured causality analysis for videos with multiple\ninterconnected events. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task and dataset,\nMulti-Event Causal Discovery (MECD). It aims to uncover the causal relations\nbetween events distributed chronologically across long videos. Given visual\nsegments and textual descriptions of events, MECD identifies the causal\nassociations between these events to derive a comprehensive and structured\nevent-level video causal graph explaining why and how the result event\noccurred. To address the challenges of MECD, we devise a novel framework\ninspired by the Granger Causality method, incorporating an efficient mask-based\nevent prediction model to perform an Event Granger Test. It estimates causality\nby comparing the predicted result event when premise events are masked versus\nunmasked. Furthermore, we integrate causal inference techniques such as\nfront-door adjustment and counterfactual inference to mitigate challenges in\nMECD like causality confounding and illusory causality. Additionally, context\nchain reasoning is introduced to conduct more robust and generalized reasoning.\nExperiments validate the effectiveness of our framework in reasoning complete\ncausal relations, outperforming GPT-4o and VideoChat2 by 5.77% and 2.70%,\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "Touch is a fundamental aspect of emotion-rich communication, playing a vital\nrole in human interaction and offering significant potential in human-robot\ninteraction. Previous research has demonstrated that a sparse representation of\nhuman touch can effectively convey social tactile signals. However, advances in\nhuman-robot tactile interaction remain limited, as many humanoid robots possess\nsimplistic capabilities, such as only opening and closing their hands,\nrestricting nuanced tactile expressions. In this study, we explore how a robot\ncan use sparse representations of tactile vibrations to convey emotions to a\nperson. To achieve this, we developed a wearable sleeve integrated with a 5x5\ngrid of vibration motors, enabling the robot to communicate diverse tactile\nemotions and gestures. Using chain prompts within a Large Language Model (LLM),\nwe generated distinct 10-second vibration patterns corresponding to 10 emotions\n(e.g., happiness, sadness, fear) and 6 touch gestures (e.g., pat, rub, tap).\nParticipants (N = 32) then rated each vibration stimulus based on perceived\nvalence and arousal. People are accurate at recognising intended emotions, a\nresult which aligns with earlier findings. These results highlight the LLM's\nability to generate emotional haptic data and effectively convey emotions\nthrough tactile signals. By translating complex emotional and tactile\nexpressions into vibratory patterns, this research demonstrates how LLMs can\nenhance physical interaction between humans and robots.",

Recently, multimodal\nlearning methods, such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), have\nadvanced significantly in jointly understanding images and text. This study\naims to assess the effectiveness of CLIP in classifying human postures,\nfocusing on its application in yoga. Despite the initial limitations of the\nzero-shot approach, applying transfer learning on 15,301 images (real and\nsynthetic) with 82 classes has shown promising results. The article describes\nthe full procedure for fine-tuning, including the choice for image description\nsyntax, models and hyperparameters adjustment. The fine-tuned CLIP model,\ntested on 3826 images, achieves an accuracy of over 85%, surpassing the current\nstate-of-the-art of previous works on the same dataset by approximately 6%, its\ntraining time being 3.5 times lower than what is needed to fine-tune a\nYOLOv8-based model. For more application-oriented scenarios, with smaller\ndatasets of six postures each, containing 1301 and 401 training images, the\nfine-tuned models attain an accuracy of 98.8% and 99.1%, respectively.\nFurthermore, our experiments indicate that training with as few as 20 images\nper pose can yield around 90% accuracy in a six-class dataset. This study\ndemonstrates that this multimodal technique can be effectively used for yoga\npose classification, and possibly for human posture classification, in general.\nAdditionally, CLIP inference time (around 7 ms) supports that the model can be\nintegrated into automated systems for posture evaluation, e.g., for developing\na real-time personal yoga assistant for performance assessment.",

In this letter, we propose a general framework to realize\nelectrical control of magnons in 2D magnetic insulators. We demonstrate that in\nbilayer ferromagnetic insulators with strong spin-layer coupling, electric\nfield Ez can effectively manipulate the spin exchange interactions between the\nlayers, enabling nonvolatile control of the corresponding magnons. Notably, in\nthis bilayer, Ez can induce nonzero Berry curvature and orbital moments of\nmagnons, the chirality of which are coupled to the direction of Ez. This\ncoupling facilitates Ez manipulate the corresponding magnon valley and orbital\nHall currents. Furthermore, such bilayers can be easily engineered, as\ndemonstrated by our density-functional-theory calculations on Janus bilayer\nCr-based ferromagnets. Our work provides an important step toward realizing\nnonvolatile magnonics and paves a promising way for future magnetoelectric\ncoupling devices.",

    "abstract": "Background: Verbal deception detection research relies on narratives and\ncommonly assumes statements as truthful or deceptive. A more realistic\nperspective acknowledges that the veracity of statements exists on a continuum\nwith truthful and deceptive parts being embedded within the same statement.\nHowever, research on embedded lies has been lagging behind. Methods: We\ncollected a novel dataset of 2,088 truthful and deceptive statements with\nannotated embedded lies. Using a within-subjects design, participants provided\na truthful account of an autobiographical event. They then rewrote their\nstatement in a deceptive manner by including embedded lies, which they\nhighlighted afterwards and judged on lie centrality, deceptiveness, and source.\nResults: We show that a fined-tuned language model (Llama-3-8B) can classify\ntruthful statements and those containing embedded lies with 64% accuracy.\nIndividual differences, linguistic properties and explainability analysis\nsuggest that the challenge of moving the dial towards embedded lies stems from\ntheir resemblance to truthful statements. Typical deceptive statements\nconsisted of 2/3 truthful information and 1/3 embedded lies, largely derived\nfrom past personal experiences and with minimal linguistic differences with\ntheir truthful counterparts. Conclusion: We present this dataset as a novel\nresource to address this challenge and foster research on embedded lies in\nverbal deception detection.",

Our soft finger is capable of switching between three\ndistinctive motion modes: bending, twisting, and extension-in approximately\nfive seconds. We carried out a detailed experimental study of the soft finger\nand evaluated its repeatability and range of motion. It exhibited repeatability\nof around one millimeter and a fifty percent larger range of motion than a\nstandard bending actuator. We developed an analytical model for a\nfiber-reinforced soft actuator for twisting motion. This helped us relate the\ninput pressure to the output twist radius of the twisting motion. This model\nwas validated by experimental verification. Further, a soft robotic gripper\nwith multiple grasp modes was developed using three actuators.

This capability is particularly crucial in tasks\nlike Video Question Answering (VideoQA), where the goal is to process visual\ndata over time together with textual data to provide coherent answers. However,\ncurrent VideoQA benchmarks devote little focus to evaluating this critical\nskill due to the challenge of annotating temporal logic. Despite the\nadvancement of vision-language models, assessing their temporal logical\nreasoning powers remains a challenge, primarily due to the lack QA pairs that\ndemand formal, complex temporal reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the\nTimeLogic QA (TLQA) framework to automatically generate the QA pairs,\nspecifically designed to evaluate the temporal logical understanding. To this\nend, TLQA leverages temporal annotations from existing video datasets together\nwith temporal operators derived from logic theory to construct questions that\ntest understanding of event sequences and their temporal relationships. TLQA\nframework is generic and scalable, capable of leveraging both, existing video\naction datasets with temporal action segmentation annotations, or video\ndatasets with temporal scene graph annotations, to automatically generate\ntemporal logical questions. We leverage 4 datasets, STAR, Breakfast, AGQA, and\nCrossTask, and generate two VideoQA dataset variants - small (TLQA-S) and large\n(TLQA-L) - containing 2k and 10k QA pairs for each category, resulting in 32k\nand 160k total pairs per dataset. We undertake a comprehensive evaluation of\nleading-edge VideoQA models, employing the TLQA to benchmark their temporal\nlogical understanding capabilities. We assess the VideoQA model's temporal\nreasoning performance on 16 categories of temporal logic with varying temporal\ncomplexity.",

We develop a simple model\nencapsulating the propagation of mutant epithelial cells and immune cells which\nresults from interactions with the intestinal barrier and bacteria. Motivated\nby the slow growth of mutant epithelial cells, and relatively slow response\nrate of the adaptive immune system, we combine geometric singular perturbation\ntheory with matched asymptotic expansions to determine the one-dimensional slow\ninvariant manifold that characterises the leading order dynamics at all times\nbeyond a passive initial adjustment phase.

Our method introduces a novel double\nvariance reduction framework that effectively reduces the gradient\napproximation variance induced by zeroth-order oracles and the stochastic\nsampling variance from finite-sum objectives. By leveraging this framework, our\nalgorithm achieves significant improvements in query efficiency, making it\nparticularly well-suited for high-dimensional optimization tasks. Specifically,\nfor convex objectives, the algorithm achieves a query complexity of O(d\n\\sqrt{n}/\\epsilon ) to find an epsilon-suboptimal solution, where d is the\ndimensionality and n is the number of functions in the finite-sum objective.\nFor non-convex objectives, it achieves a query complexity of\nO(d^{3/2}\\sqrt{n}/\\epsilon^2 ) without requiring the computation ofd partial\nderivatives at each iteration. These complexities are the best known among\nzeroth-order stochastic Frank-Wolfe algorithms that avoid explicit gradient\ncalculations. Empirical experiments on convex and non-convex machine learning\ntasks, including sparse logistic regression, robust classification, and\nadversarial attacks on deep networks, validate the computational efficiency and\nscalability of our approach.

To this end, this paper proposes a novel View-specific Attention\nGeo-localization method (VAGeo) for accurate CVOGL. Specifically, VAGeo\ncontains two key modules: view-specific positional encoding (VSPE) module and\nchannel-spatial hybrid attention (CSHA) module. In object-level, according to\nthe characteristics of different viewpoints of ground and drone query images,\nviewpoint-specific positional codings are designed to more accurately identify\nthe click-point object of the query image in the VSPE module. In feature-level,\na hybrid attention in the CSHA module is introduced by combining channel\nattention and spatial attention mechanisms simultaneously for learning\ndiscriminative features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed VAGeo gains a significant performance improvement, i.e., improving\nacc@0.25/acc@0.5 on the CVOGL dataset from 45.43%/42.24% to 48.21%/45.22% for\nground-view, and from 61.97%/57.66% to 66.19%/61.87% for drone-view.",

To tackle\nthis issue, we introduce an incentive mechanism based on individual strategies\nand incomes, wherein a portion of the income from defectors is allocated to\nreward low-income cooperators, aiming to enhance cooperation by improving the\nequitable distribution of wealth across the entire population. Moreover,\nprevious research has typically employed network structures or game mechanisms\ncharacterized by homogeneity. In this study, we present a network framework\nthat more accurately reflects real-world conditions, where agents are engaged\nin multiple games, including prisoner's dilemma games in the top-layer and\npublic good games in the down-layer networks. Within this framework, we\nintroduce the concept of ``external coupling'' which connects agents across\ndifferent networks as acquaintances, thereby facilitating access to shared\ndatasets. Our results indicate that the combined positive effects of external\ncoupling and incentive mechanism lead to optimal cooperation rates and lower\nGini coefficients, demonstrating a negative correlation between cooperation and\ninequality. From a micro-level perspective, this phenomenon primarily arises\nfrom the regular network, whereas suboptimal outcomes are observed within the\nscale-free network.

We propose a method aimed at obtaining a robust\ndetermination of the rotation period of asteroids, while avoiding the pitfalls\nof aliases. We applied this approach to thousands of asteroid light curves\nmeasured by the NASA TESS mission. We developed a robust period-analysis\nalgorithm based on a Fourier series. Our approach includes a comparison of the\nresults from multiple orders and tests on the number of extremes to identify\nand reject potential aliases. We also provide the uncertainty interval for the\nresult as well as additional periods that may be plausible. We report the\nrotation period for 4521 asteroids within a precision of 10%. A comparison with\nthe literature (whenever available) reveals a very good agreement and validates\nthe approach presented here. Our approach also highlights cases for which the\ndetermination of the period should be considered invalid. The dataset presented\nhere confirms the apparent small number of asteroids with a rotation between 50\nand 100 h and correlated with diameter. The amplitude of the light curves is\nfound to increase toward smaller diameters, as asteroids become less and less\nspherical. Finally, there is a systematic difference between the broad C and S\ncomplex in the amplitude-period, revealing the statistically lower density of\nC-types compared to S-type asteroids. Conclusions. Our approach to the\ndetermination of asteroid rotation period is based on simple concepts, yet it\nis nonetheless robust.

We find that the Brunt-V\\\"{a}is\\\"{a}l\\\"{a} (BV)\nfrequency increases significantly at densities slightly above the neutron drip\ndensity (i.e., neutron stars' inner crusts), which leads to crust $g$-mode\noscillations with their frequencies insensitive to the adopted density\nfunctional. At larger densities, BV frequency increases as well due to the\ncore-crust transitions and emergence of muons, which lead to core $g$-mode\noscillations. It is found that the obtained core $g$-mode frequencies generally\nincrease with the slope of nuclear symmetry energy $L$, which eventually\nintersect with that of the crust $g$ modes adopting large enough $L$. This\nleads to the avoid-crossing phenomenon for the global $g$ modes that encompass\ncontributions from both the crust and core. The correlation between the global\n$g_1$ mode and $L$ is identified for neutron stars with masses $M\\gtrsim 1.4\\\nM_{\\odot}$, which enables the measurements of $L$ based on gravitational wave\nobservations. In our future study, the effects of the discontinuities in\ndensity or shear modulus should be considered, while the temperature, rotation,\nmagnetic field, and superfluid neutron gas in neutron stars could also play\nimportant roles.",

Relaxed real-time constraints mean\nthat only a subset of the processes of a CPS have real-time constraints, and a\nmode-dependent CPS has conditional execution branches. Static analysis tools,\nsuch as the PolyGraph model (a formalism extending the Cyclo-Static Dataflow\nmodel with real-time constraints), can specify and analyze systems with relaxed\nreal-time constraints. However, PolyGraph is limited in its ability to specify\nand analyze mode-dependent CPSs. This paper extends PolyGraph with routing\nactors, yielding the Routed PolyGraph model. This model is further extended to\nthe Real-time Mode-Aware Dataflow (RMDF), which both leverages routing actors\nand incorporates a new dataflow actor to specify mode-dependent CPSs under\nrelaxed real-time constraints. This paper also extends the static analyses of\nPolyGraph to RMDF.

A large variety of commercial robotic solutions are already available\nand deployed. However, the adoption by farmers of such solutions is still low\nfor many reasons, an important one being the lack of trust in these systems.\nThis is in great part due to the opaqueness and complexity of deep neural\nnetworks and the manufacturers' inability to provide valid guarantees on their\nperformance. Conformal prediction, a well-established methodology in the\nmachine learning community, is an efficient and reliable strategy for providing\ntrustworthy guarantees on the predictions of any black-box model under very\nminimal constraints. Bridging the gap between the safe machine learning and\nprecision agriculture communities, this article showcases conformal prediction\nin action on the task of precision weeding through deep learning-based image\nclassification. After a detailed presentation of the conformal prediction\nmethodology and the development of a precision spraying pipeline based on a\n''conformalized'' neural network and well-defined spraying decision rules, the\narticle evaluates this pipeline on two real-world scenarios: one under\nin-distribution conditions, the other reflecting a near out-of-distribution\nsetting.

On the other hand, extended compact\nobjects such as axion stars, which are supported by gravity and axion self\ninteractions, may have also been formed in the early Universe and comprise part\nof DM. In this work, we consider the lensing of electromagnetic signals from\ndistant sources by axion stars, as a way to constrain the properties of axion\nstars and fundamental axion parameters. Accounting for the effect of the finite\nsize of the axion star, we study the lensing effect induced by gravity, and by\naxion-photon interactions. The latter effect is frequency dependent, and is\nrelevant in the low frequency band, which motivates the use of fast radio burst\n(FRB) signals as a probe. We calculate the predicted number of lensed FRB\nevents by specifying the fundamental axion parameters, axion star radial\nprofile, fraction of DM residing in axion stars, and imposing lensing criteria\nbased on the flux ratio and time delay between the brightest images from\nlensing. Assuming an optimistic case of $10^4$ observed FRB events, and a\ntiming resolution of $1\\,\\mu{\\rm s}$, the lack of observed FRB lensing events\nin CHIME allows us to probe axion stars with mass $ \\gtrsim 10^{-2} M_\\odot$,\ncorresponding to axion masses $\\lesssim 10^{-10}\\,{\\rm eV}$ and for negligible\naxion-photon couplings. Even lighter axion stars up to $\\sim 10^{-3} M_\\odot$\ncan be probed, assuming axion-photon couplings of at least $10^{-6}\\,{\\rm\nGeV}^{-1}$. Our results indicate that while FRB lensing by axion stars lead to\nsensitivities that are competitive with conventional microlensing searches\noperating in the optical band, it remains a challenge to probe axion-photon\ninduced lensing effects.",

    "abstract": "Detecting and classifying abnormal system states is critical for condition\nmonitoring, but supervised methods often fall short due to the rarity of\nanomalies and the lack of labeled data. Therefore, clustering is often used to\ngroup similar abnormal behavior. However, evaluating cluster quality without\nground truth is challenging, as existing measures such as the Silhouette Score\n(SSC) only evaluate the cohesion and separation of clusters and ignore possible\nprior knowledge about the data. To address this challenge, we introduce the\nSynchronized Anomaly Agreement Index (SAAI), which exploits the synchronicity\nof anomalies across multivariate time series to assess cluster quality. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of SAAI by showing that maximizing SAAI improves\naccuracy on the task of finding the true number of anomaly classes K in\ncorrelated time series by 0.23 compared to SSC and by 0.32 compared to X-Means.\nWe also show that clusters obtained by maximizing SAAI are easier to interpret\ncompared to SSC.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting (GS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are two\ngroundbreaking technologies that have revolutionized the field of Novel View\nSynthesis (NVS), enabling immersive photorealistic rendering and user\nexperiences by synthesizing multiple viewpoints from a set of images of sparse\nviews. The potential applications of NVS, such as high-quality virtual and\naugmented reality, detailed 3D modeling, and realistic medical organ imaging,\nunderscore the importance of quality assessment of NVS methods from the\nperspective of human perception. Although some previous studies have explored\nsubjective quality assessments for NVS technology, they still face several\nchallenges, especially in NVS methods selection, scenario coverage, and\nevaluation methodology. To address these challenges, we conducted two\nsubjective experiments for the quality assessment of NVS technologies\ncontaining both GS-based and NeRF-based methods, focusing on dynamic and\nreal-world scenes. This study covers 360{\\deg}, front-facing, and\nsingle-viewpoint videos while providing a richer and greater number of real\nscenes. Meanwhile, it's the first time to explore the impact of NVS methods in\ndynamic scenes with moving objects. The two types of subjective experiments\nhelp to fully comprehend the influences of different viewing paths from a human\nperception perspective and pave the way for future development of\nfull-reference and no-reference quality metrics. In addition, we established a\ncomprehensive benchmark of various state-of-the-art objective metrics on the\nproposed database, highlighting that existing methods still struggle to\naccurately capture subjective quality. The results give us some insights into\nthe limitations of existing NVS methods and may promote the development of new\nNVS methods.",

Notably, it can\nprovide ultrafast (~ns) and high temperature profiles ($>1000^\\circ$C). When\nthe maximum temperature exceeds the melting point, a solid-liquid phase\ntransition is observed, immediately followed by rapid recrystallization. This\nunique annealing mechanism gives raises questions about dopant diffusion and\nresidual defects, in not only in the recrystallized region, but also just below\nit. As power devices require micrometer-sized junctions, high laser energy\ndensities are needed, which were proved to promote the incorporation of complex\nimpurities from the surface and the creation of defects at the liquid/solid\ninterface. This paper reports on the impact of laser annealing at high energy\ndensities (up to 8.0 J/cm$^2$) on the leakage current, using Schottky and PN\ndiodes, and DLTS measurements. Various laser annealing conditions were used:\nenergy densities between 1.7 and 8.0 J/cm$^2$ with 1 to 10 pulses. Our results\nsuggest that the liquid and solid solubility of vacancies in silicon are fixed\nby the maximum temperature reached, so to the energy density. Increasing the\nnumber of laser pulses allows, not only to reach this maximum vacancy\nconcentration but also to promote their diffusion towards the surface.\nConcomitantly, the in-diffusion of complex impurities inside the melted region\nallows the coupling between both defect types to create trap centers,\nresponsible for the degradation of the leakage current.",

    "abstract": "Combinatorial medication recommendation(CMR) is a fundamental task of\nhealthcare, which offers opportunities for clinical physicians to provide more\nprecise prescriptions for patients with intricate health conditions,\nparticularly in the scenarios of long-term medical care. Previous research\nefforts have sought to extract meaningful information from electronic health\nrecords (EHRs) to facilitate combinatorial medication recommendations. Existing\nlearning-based approaches further consider the chemical structures of\nmedications, but ignore the textual medication descriptions in which the\nfunctionalities are clearly described. Furthermore, the textual knowledge\nderived from the EHRs of patients remains largely underutilized. To address\nthese issues, we introduce the Natural Language-Assisted Multi-modal Medication\nRecommendation(NLA-MMR), a multi-modal alignment framework designed to learn\nknowledge from the patient view and medication view jointly. Specifically,\nNLA-MMR formulates CMR as an alignment problem from patient and medication\nmodalities. In this vein, we employ pretrained language models(PLMs) to extract\nin-domain knowledge regarding patients and medications, serving as the\nfoundational representation for both modalities. In the medication modality, we\nexploit both chemical structures and textual descriptions to create medication\nrepresentations. In the patient modality, we generate the patient\nrepresentations based on textual descriptions of diagnosis, procedure, and\nsymptom. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly accessible datasets\ndemonstrate that NLA-MMR achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with a\nnotable average improvement of 4.72% in Jaccard score.

The presence of these two spectrally-distinct families of\nexcitons in each GaN layer of the heterostructure is demonstrated using three\ndifferent experimental methods: (i) low-power $\\mathrm{\\mu}$-photoluminescence\n($\\mathrm{\\mu PL}$) using laser excitation sources with wavelengths above and\nbelow the AlGaN bandgap, (ii) $\\mathrm{\\mu PL}$ as a function of optically\ninjected free carrier density, and (iii) quantitative numerical simulation of\nthe $\\mathrm{\\mu}$-Reflectivity ($\\mathrm{\\mu R}$). One major impact of the\nbuilt-in electric field is the reduction of the excitonic lifetime in the GaN\nsurface layer, which transitions from less than 10 ps in the presence of the\nbuilt-in electric field to the bulk lifetime (90 ps) when the field is\nscreened.

    "abstract": "Mixed-precision quantization methods have been proposed to reduce model size\nwhile minimizing accuracy degradation. However, existing studies require\nretraining and do not consider the computational overhead and intermediate\nrepresentations (IR) generated during the compilation process, limiting their\napplication at the compiler level. This computational overhead refers to the\nruntime latency caused by frequent quantization and dequantization operations\nduring inference. Performing these operations at the individual operator level\ncauses significant runtime delays. To address these issues, we propose\nQuantuneV2, a compiler-based mixed-precision quantization method designed for\npractical embedded AI applications. QuantuneV2 performs inference only twice,\nonce before quantization and once after quantization, and operates with a\ncomputational complexity of O(n) that increases linearly with the number of\nmodel parameters. We also made the sensitivity analysis more stable by using\nlocal metrics like weights, activation values, the Signal to Quantization Noise\nRatio, and the Mean Squared Error. We also cut down on computational overhead\nby choosing the best IR and using operator fusion. Experimental results show\nthat QuantuneV2 achieved up to a 10.28 percent improvement in accuracy and a\n12.52 percent increase in speed compared to existing methods across five\nmodels: ResNet18v1, ResNet50v1, SqueezeNetv1, VGGNet, and MobileNetv2. This\ndemonstrates that QuantuneV2 enhances model performance while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency, making it suitable for deployment in embedded AI\nenvironments.",

The outstanding\nevidence of such complex structure occurred on May 10-11,2024, when the\nstrongest geomagnetic storm was caused by a series of successive CMEs emerged\nfrom the same solar AR13664. The complex formed from the first 4 CMEs of the\nseries triggered a drop of the Dst-index to -412nT. The aim of this study is to\nconsider propagation of these ICMEs in the heliosphere using observations at\nthree stages: at the starting point observed with the LASCO, in the middle\nheliosphere by the IPS method and in situ at the L1 point with the ACE. The IPS\nobservations were carried out on May 9 and 10 with the BSA LPI, which enables\nto build in the scanning mode 2D map of scintillation index m2 associated with\nenhancements of the integrated over the LOS plasma density over a range of the\nheliocentric distances 0.4-0.8AU. Evolution of the ICMEs in the heliosphere was\ndescribed using a cone model in the selfsimilar approximation and kinematics\naccording to the DBM. The initial spatial distributions of density at the cone\nbase were determined from the LASCO images of the CMEs at the heights of\n20Rsun, and then were rescaled according to radial distances to the position\ncorresponding to the time of the BSA observations. It was shown that the\nmodeled distribution of the ICME complex LOS density N2 over heliocentric\ndistance is consistent with distribution of m2. Some discrepancies may\ncharacterize variation of the density structure inside the complex due to CME\ninteraction. The modeled mean volume density of the ICME plasma at the L1\nposition agreed with in situ ACE measurements, which validates the developed\nexpansion model.",

While existing studies affirm the connection\nbetween living environments and health outcomes, most rely on single data\nmodalities or simplistic feature concatenation of multi-modal information,\nlimiting their ability to comprehensively profile the health-oriented urban\nenvironments. To fill this gap, we propose CureGraph, a contrastive multi-modal\nrepresentation learning framework for urban health prediction that employs\ngraph-based techniques to infer the prevalence of common chronic diseases among\nthe elderly within the urban living circles of each neighborhood. CureGraph\nleverages rich multi-modal information, including photos and textual reviews of\nresidential areas and their surrounding points of interest, to generate urban\nneighborhood embeddings. By integrating pre-trained visual and textual encoders\nwith graph modeling techniques, CureGraph captures cross-modal spatial\ndependencies, offering a comprehensive understanding of urban environments\ntailored to elderly health considerations. Extensive experiments on real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that CureGraph improves the best baseline by $28\\%$ on\naverage in terms of $R^2$ across elderly disease risk prediction tasks.\nMoreover, the model enables the identification of stage-wise chronic disease\nprogression and supports comparative public health analysis across\nneighborhoods, offering actionable insights for sustainable urban development\nand enhanced quality of life.

The luminosity\nfractions of the dynamically cold, warm, and hot components in both TNG50 and\nTNG100 galaxies exhibit general consistency with those observed in CALIFA\ngalaxies. For example, they all exhibit a minimum luminosity fraction of the\ndynamically hot component in galaxies with intermediate stellar masses, and the\nmorphology of each orbital component in the TNG50 and TNG100 galaxies closely\nresembles that found in the CALIFA galaxies. We therefore use the simulations\nto quantify the physical origins of the different components, focusing on the\ndynamically hot component in TNG50. We identify three primary regimes and thus\nphysical processes: (1) in low mass galaxies that have not experienced major\nmergers, stars are born with a wide range of circularity distributions and have\nremained relatively unchanged until the present day. Consequently, hot stars in\nsuch galaxies at redshift 0 are predominantly born hot. (2) In higher mass\ngalaxies lacking major mergers, most stars are initially born cold but are\nsubsequently heated through secular evolution. (3) In galaxies across the\nentire mass range, mergers, if they occurred, significantly increased the hot\norbital fraction. As a result, the dynamically hot bulge within $R_e$ of\npresent-day galaxies does not indicate their past merger histories; instead,\nthe hot stars in the outer regions are mostly heated or accreted by mergers,\nthus indicating galaxy merger history. The massive galaxies are initially born\nwith cold, rotationally supported structures, consistent with recent\nobservations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) regarding high-redshift\ngalaxies.",

This work\nintroduces a LoRa Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system and a spatial\nmultiplexing algorithm to address LoRa's bandwidth limitation. The transceivers\nin the proposed approach modulate the signals on distinct frequencies of the\nsame LoRa band. A Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) method is used at the\ntransmitters to provide a wider MIMO channel. Unlike conventional Orthogonal\nFrequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) techniques, this work exploits the\northogonality of the LoRa signals facilitated by its proprietary Chirp Spread\nSpectrum (CSS) modulation to perform an OFDM in the proposed LoRa MIMO system.\nBy varying the Spreading Factor (SF) and bandwidth of LoRa signals, orthogonal\nsignals can transmit on the same frequency irrespective of the FDM. Even though\nthe channel correlation is minimal for different spreading factors and\nbandwidths, different Carrier Frequencies (CF) ensure the signals do not\noverlap and provide additional degrees of freedom. This work assesses the\nproposed model's performance and conducts an extensive analysis to provide an\noverview of resources consumed by the proposed system. Finally, this work\nprovides the detailed results of a thorough evaluation of the model on test\nhardware.",

Despite the impressive performance of current 3DSOT\nmethods, evaluating them on clean datasets inadequately reflects their\ncomprehensive performance, as the adverse weather conditions in real-world\nsurroundings has not been considered. One of the main obstacles is the lack of\nadverse weather benchmarks for the evaluation of 3DSOT. To this end, this work\nproposes a challenging benchmark for LiDAR-based 3DSOT in adverse weather,\nwhich comprises two synthetic datasets (KITTI-A and nuScenes-A) and one\nreal-world dataset (CADC-SOT) spanning three weather types: rain, fog, and\nsnow. Based on this benchmark, five representative 3D trackers from different\ntracking frameworks conducted robustness evaluation, resulting in significant\nperformance degradations. This prompts the question: What are the factors that\ncause current advanced methods to fail on such adverse weather samples?\nConsequently, we explore the impacts of adverse weather and answer the above\nquestion from three perspectives: 1) target distance; 2) template shape\ncorruption; and 3) target shape corruption. Finally, based on domain\nrandomization and contrastive learning, we designed a dual-branch tracking\nframework for adverse weather, named DRCT, achieving excellent performance in\nbenchmarks.",

This separation enables quantification of their individual and combined\ncontributions to refraction. Through analysis of a few limiting cases, we\ndemonstrate how the sign and magnitude of these components influence the wave\nrefraction, and identify conditions where they either amplify or counteract\neach other. We also identify which of the two plays a dominant role.

    "abstract": "Edge computing has become critical for enabling latency-sensitive\napplications, especially when paired with cloud resources to form\ncloud-assisted edge clusters. However, efficient resource management remains\nchallenging due to edge nodes' limited capacity and unreliable connectivity.\nThis paper introduces KubeDSM, a Kubernetes-based dynamic scheduling and\nmigration framework tailored for cloud-assisted edge environments. KubeDSM\naddresses the challenges of resource fragmentation, dynamic scheduling, and\nlive migration while ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) for latency-sensitive\napplications. Unlike Kubernetes' default scheduler, KubeDSM adopts batch\nscheduling to minimize resource fragmentation and incorporates a live migration\nmechanism to optimize edge resource utilization. Specifically, KubeDSM\nfacilitates three key operations: intra-edge migration to reduce fragmentation,\nedge-to-cloud migration during resource shortages, and cloud-to-edge migration\nwhen resources become available, thereby increasing the number of pods\nallocated to the edge. Our results demonstrate that KubeDSM consistently\nachieves a higher average edge ratio and a lower standard deviation in edge\nratios, highlighting its ability to provide more effective and stable\nscheduling across different deployments. We also explore the impact of\nmigration strategies and Quality of Service (QoS) configurations on the edge\nratios achieved by KubeDSM. The findings reveal that enabling migrations\nsignificantly enhances the edge ratio by reducing fragmentation. Additionally,\nKubeDSM's adaptability in respecting QoS requirements while maximizing overall\nedge ratios is confirmed through different QoS scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation wireless networks are poised to benefit significantly from\nthe integration of three key technologies (KTs): Rate-Splitting Multiple Access\n(RSMA), cell-free architectures, and federated learning. Each of these\ntechnologies offers distinct advantages in terms of security, robustness, and\ndistributed structure. In this paper, we propose a novel cell-free network\narchitecture that incorporates RSMA and employs machine learning techniques\nwithin a federated framework. This combination leverages the strengths of each\nKT, creating a synergistic effect that maximizes the benefits of security,\nrobustness, and distributed structure. We formally formulate the access point\n(AP) selection and precoder design for max-min rate optimization in a cell-free\nMIMO RSMA network. Our proposed solution scheme involves a three-block\nprocedure. The first block trains deep reinforcement learning (DRL) neural\nnetworks to obtain RSMA precoders, assuming full connectivity between APs and\nuser equipments (UEs). The second block uses these precoders and principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) to assign APs to UEs by removing a subset of AP-UE\nconnections. The final block fine-tunes the RSMA precoders by incorporating the\nassociated APs into a second DRL network. To leverage the distributed nature of\nthe cell-free network, this process is implemented in a Federated Deep\nReinforcement Learning (FDRL) structure operating through the cooperation of\nAPs and a central processing unit (CPU). Simulation results demonstrate that\nthe proposed FDRL approach performs comparably to a benchmark centralized DRL\nscheme. Our FDRL approach, provides a balanced trade-off, maintaining high\nperformance with enhanced security and reduced processing demands.",

These factors significantly hinder the model's\nability to accurately capture and analyze structural relationships and dynamic\npatterns across various regions of the heart. Mamba, an emerging model, is one\nof the most cutting-edge approaches that is widely applied to diverse vision\nand language tasks. To this end, this paper introduces a U-shaped deep learning\nmodel incorporating a large-window Mamba scale (LMS) module and a hierarchical\nfeature fusion approach for echocardiographic segmentation. First, a cascaded\nresidual block serves as an encoder and is employed to incrementally extract\nmultiscale detailed features. Second, a large-window multiscale mamba module is\nintegrated into the decoder to capture global dependencies across regions and\nenhance the segmentation capability for complex anatomical structures.\nFurthermore, our model introduces auxiliary losses at each decoder layer and\nemploys a dual attention mechanism to fuse multilayer features both spatially\nand across channels. This approach enhances segmentation performance and\naccuracy in delineating complex anatomical structures. Finally, the\nexperimental results using the EchoNet-Dynamic and CAMUS datasets demonstrate\nthat the model outperforms other methods in terms of both accuracy and\nrobustness. For the segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium\n(${LV}_{endo}$), the model achieved optimal values of 95.01 and 93.36,\nrespectively, while for the left ventricular epicardium (${LV}_{epi}$), values\nof 87.35 and 87.80, respectively, were achieved.

It turns out that the excess can be\nreproduced by a group of dark stars with $M \\gtrsim 10^{3}\\, \\rm M_{\\odot}$,\nbecause of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift\ngalaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of\nWeakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV\nto a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars\nholds up to $\\sim 10^{5}M_\\odot$, the relic black holes stemming from their\ncollapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations\nof Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small\nfraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and\nthe majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III\nstars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.",

The perturbations of the magnetic field and plasma density\nin the soliton are nonmonotonic in space and, along with the perturbation in\nthe form of a well, there are also perturbation humps. Such peculiar radial\nsoliton profiles differ significantly from previously known results on 2D\nsolitons. The key point is that the presence of a gap in the DIMA wave\ndispersion due to the Rao cutoff frequency causes the nonlinearity to be\nnonlocal. We show that due to nonlocal nonlinearity the Hamiltonian is bounded\nbelow at fixed energy, proving the stability of the ground state.",

ASR\nsystems often struggle to accurately transcribe intra-sentential CS due to\ntheir training on monolingual data and the unpredictable nature of CS. This\nissue is even more pronounced for low-resource languages, where limited data\navailability hinders the development of robust models. In this study, we\npropose AdaCS, a normalization model integrates an adaptive bias attention\nmodule (BAM) into encoder-decoder network. This novel approach provides a\nrobust solution to CS ASR in unseen domains, thereby significantly enhancing\nour contribution to the field. By utilizing BAM to both identify and normalize\nCS phrases, AdaCS enhances its adaptive capabilities with a biased list of\nwords provided during inference. Our method demonstrates impressive performance\nand the ability to handle unseen CS phrases across various domains.

In this study, we\npropose a Spatial-aware Adaptive Masking Knowledge Distillation (SAMKD)\nframework for accurate object detection. Different from previous feature\ndistillation methods which mainly perform single-scale feature masking, we\ndevelop spatially hierarchical feature masking distillation scheme, such that\nthe object-aware locality is encoded during coarse-to-fine distillation process\nfor improved feature reconstruction. In addition, our spatial-aware feature\ndistillation strategy is combined with a masking logit distillation scheme in\nwhich region-specific feature difference between teacher and student networks\nis utilized to adaptively guide the distillation process. Thus, it can help the\nstudent model to better learn from the teacher counterpart with improved\nknowledge transfer and reduced gap. Extensive experiments for detection task\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method.

Additionally, the reliance\non object templates at test time limits their generalisability to unseen\nobjects. To address these challenges, we propose to leverage superquadrics as\nan alternative 3D object representation to bounding boxes and demonstrate their\neffectiveness on both template-free object reconstruction and action\nrecognition tasks. Moreover, as we find that pure appearance-based methods can\noutperform the unified methods, the potential benefits from 3D geometric\ninformation remain unclear. Therefore, we study the compositionality of actions\nby considering a more challenging task where the training combinations of verbs\nand nouns do not overlap with the testing split. We extend H2O and FPHA\ndatasets with compositional splits and design a novel collaborative learning\nframework that can explicitly reason about the geometric relations between\nhands and the manipulated object.

However, some cosmological simulations\nshow that clumps can form in regions where $Q\\gg1$. In these simulations, there\nis an excess of compressive modes of turbulence that lead to gravitational\ncollapse of regions that were not supposed to gravitationally collapse,\naccording to linear theory. In contrast, sites of clump formation in isolated\nsimulations do not show this excess, hinting that the origin may be external.\nWe explore two external mechanisms that can induce compressive modes of disk\nturbulence in protoclumps, namely, compressive tides exerted by the\ncosmological environment and the direct driving by inflowing streams. We\ncorrelate the local strength of compressive tides and the amount of fresh\nstream material with protoclump regions in zoom-in cosmological simulations.\nThe local strength of compressive tides is derived from the tidal tensor. The\nlocal strength of incoming streams is derived from the fractional presence of\nthe stream compared to the average. We find that the tidal field in protoclumps\ntends to be over-compressive while random patches in the disk show diverging\ntides. In particular, in $25\\%$ of the protoclumps, the tidal field is fully\ncompressive, while no random patch resides in regions of fully compressive\ntides. In addition, protoclumps tend to reside in regions where the fraction of\nincoming stream mass is 2-10 times larger than the average at the same\ngalactocentric radius. Both compressive tides and inflowing streams are\ncorrelated with the protoclumps and can thus serve as the drivers of excessive\ncompressive turbulence that can initiate clump formation.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems aim to provide personalized item recommendations by\ncapturing user behaviors derived from their interaction history. Considering\nthat user interactions naturally occur sequentially based on users' intents in\nmind, user behaviors can be interpreted as user intents. Therefore,\nintent-based sequential recommendations are actively studied recently to model\nuser intents from historical interactions for a more precise user understanding\nbeyond traditional studies that often overlook the underlying semantics behind\nuser interactions. However, existing studies face three challenges: 1) the\nlimited understanding of user behaviors by focusing solely on intents, 2) the\nlack of robustness in categorizing intents due to arbitrary fixed numbers of\nintent categories, and 3) the neglect of interacted items in modeling of user\nintents. To address these challenges, we propose Intent-Interest\nDisentanglement and Item-Aware Intent Contrastive Learning for Sequential\nRecommendation (IDCLRec). IDCLRec disentangles user behaviors into intents\nwhich are dynamic motivations and interests which are stable tastes of users\nfor a comprehensive understanding of user behaviors. A causal cross-attention\nmechanism is used to identify consistent interests across interactions, while\nresidual behaviors are modeled as intents by modeling their temporal dynamics\nthrough a similarity adjustment loss. In addition, without predefining the\nnumber of intent categories, an importance-weighted attention mechanism\ncaptures user-specific categorical intent considering the importance of intent\nfor each interaction. Furthermore, we introduce item-aware contrastive learning\nwhich aligns intents that occurred the same interaction and aligns intent with\nitem combinations occurred by the corresponding intent. Extensive experiments\nconducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IDCLRec.",

In\nparticular, to fully harness the potential benefits of RSMA, we propose a\nmethod that approximates the error covariance matrix and incorporates it into\nthe precoder optimization process. This approach effectively accounts for the\nimpact of imperfect CSIT, enabling the design of a robust precoder that\nefficiently handles CSIT inaccuracies.

Although researchers have\nmoved from designing efficient video quality mapping models to various research\ndirections, in-depth exploration of the effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs of\nspatio-temporal modeling in VQA models is still less sufficient.

To this end, we drastically sample the video's information from both\nspatial and temporal dimensions, and the heavily squeezed video is then fed\ninto a stable VQA model. Comprehensive experiments regarding joint spatial and\ntemporal sampling are conducted on six public video quality databases, and the\nresults demonstrate the acceptable performance of the VQA model when throwing\naway most of the video information. Furthermore, with the proposed joint\nspatial and temporal sampling strategy, we make an initial attempt to design an\nonline VQA model, which is instantiated by as simple as possible a spatial\nfeature extractor, a temporal feature fusion module, and a global quality\nregression module.

Approach: The proposed T1 mapping technique\n(mIR-rt) samples the recovery of inverted magnetization using the real-time GRE\nand the images captured during diastole are selected for T1 fitting.\nMultiple-inversion recoveries are employed to increase the sample size for\naccurate fitting. The T1 mapping method was validated using Bloch simulation,\nphantom studies, and in 16 healthy volunteers at 5T. Main results: In both\nsimulation and phantom studies, the T1 values measured by mIR-rt closely\napproximate the reference T1 values, with errors less than 3%, while the\nconventional MOLLI sequence underestimates T1 values. The myocardial T1 values\nat 5T are 1553 +/- 52 ms, 1531 +/- 53 ms, and 1526 +/- 60 ms (mean +/- standard\ndeviation) at the apex, middle, and base, respectively.

Notably, it admits an explicit\nself-similar blow-up solution whose radial stability, conjectured more than two\ndecades ago in [Brenner-Constantin-Kadanoff-Schenkel-Venkataramani, 1999], was\nrecently confirmed by [Glogi\\'c-Sch\\\"orkhuber, 2024]. This paper aims to extend\nthe radial stability to the nonradial setting, building on the\nfinite-codimensional stability analysis in our previous work [Li-Zhou, 2024].\nThe main input is the mode stability of the linearized operator, whose nonlocal\nnature presents essential challenges for the spectral analysis. Besides a\nquantitative perturbative analysis for the high spherical classes, we adapt in\nthe first spherical class the wave operator method of [Li-Wei-Zhang, 2020] for\nthe fluid stability to localize the operator and remove the known unstable mode\nsimultaneously. Our method provides localization beyond the partial mass\nvariable and is independent of the explicit formula of the profile, so it\npotentially sheds light on other linear nonlocal problems.",

Recently, score-based diffusion models learn a\nglobal diffusion prior and provide a good modeling of the stochastic dynamics,\nshowing new potential for DA. However, their all-at-once generation rather than\nstep-by-step transition limits their performance when dealing with highly\ncomplex stochastic processes and lacks physical interpretability. To tackle\nthese drawbacks, we introduce FlowDAS, a generative DA framework that uses\nstochastic interpolants to directly learn state transition dynamics and achieve\nstep-by-step transition to better model the real dynamics. We also improve the\nframework by combining the observation, better suiting the DA settings.\nDirectly learning the underlying dynamics from collected data removes\nrestrictive dynamical assumptions, and conditioning on observations at each\ninterpolation step yields stable, measurement-consistent forecasts. Experiments\non Lorenz-63, Navier-Stokes super-resolution/sparse-observation scenarios, and\nlarge-scale weather forecasting -- where dynamics are partly or wholly unknown\n-- show that FlowDAS surpasses model-driven methods, neural operators, and\nscore-based baselines in accuracy and physical plausibility.",

Second,\nwe leverage the latest five LLM models (across companies), ensuring\ncomprehensive coverage across the most advanced capabilities in the field.\n  We conducted a series of rigorous evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat a well-designed prompt can reduce the false-positive rate by over 60%.\nSurprisingly, we also discovered that the recall rate for detecting some\nspecific vulnerabilities in Solidity v0.8 has dropped to just 13% compared to\nearlier versions (i.e., v0.4).

We also incorporate a dynamic trust update mechanism that\nadjusts the trust for each source based on its performance over time. In\naddition, we introduce the concept of probability dominance to identify sources\nwith dominant trust.

We present MAGNUS (Matrix Algebra for Gigantic\nNUmerical Systems), a novel algorithm to maximize data locality in SpGEMM. To\ngenerate locality, MAGNUS reorders the intermediate product into discrete\ncache-friendly chunks using a two-level hierarchical approach. The accumulator\nis applied to each chunk, where the chunk size is chosen such that the\naccumulator is cache-efficient. MAGNUS is input- and system-aware: based on the\nmatrix characteristics and target system specifications, the optimal number of\nchunks is computed by minimizing the storage cost of the necessary data\nstructures. MAGNUS allows for a hybrid accumulation strategy in which each\nchunk uses a different accumulator based on an input threshold. We consider two\naccumulators: an AVX-512 vectorized bitonic sorting algorithm and classical\ndense accumulation. An OpenMP implementation of MAGNUS is compared with several\nbaselines, including Intel MKL, for a variety of different matrices on three\nIntel architectures. For matrices from the SuiteSparse collection, MAGNUS is\nfaster than all the baselines in most cases and is often an order of magnitude\nfaster than at least one baseline.

We analyzed\nobservations of SGR J1935+2154 for nearly three months, using data from Neutron\nStar Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We report the timing and spectral\nresults following the onset of this outburst. In general, the X-ray flux of the\npersistent emission decays exponentially. While a flare is evident on the light\ncurve, a fast radio burst (FRB) was detected immediately following the peak of\nthis flare. We found a phase jump of pulse profile, with a deviation of\n$0.16\\pm0.03$ phase, which is related to the glitch. The spectra are well fit\nwith the combination of a blackbody and a power law model. The decay of the\noutburst is dominated by the drop of the non-thermal component, which also\nleads to the increase of thermal proportion. The photon index of the power law\nis inversely correlated with both the unabsorbed flux and the burst rate. We\nfind that unlike the large variety of the persistent emission around FRB\n221014, the X-ray properties are very stable when FRBs 221021 and 221201\nhappened.

Given these points, we can train a detector that achieves superior\nperformance than existing detection methods to identify adversarial examples.\nOur experiments have demonstrated the high effectiveness of our detection\nmethod. For these six adversarial attack methods, our detector's AUC scores all\nexceed 0.95. Protego may advance investigations in metaverse security.",

    "abstract": "Mapping genotypes to phenotypes (G2P) is a fundamental goal in biology. So\ncalled PhyloG2P methods are a relatively new set of tools that leverage\nreplicated evolution in phylogenetically independent lineages to identify\ngenomic regions associated with traits of interest. Here, we review recent\ndevelopments in PhyloG2P methods, focusing on three key areas: methods based on\nreplicated amino acid substitutions, methods detecting changes in evolutionary\nrates, and methods analysing gene duplication and loss. We discuss how the\ndefinition and measurement of traits impacts the utility of these methods,\narguing that focusing on simple rather than compound traits will lead to more\nmeaningful genotype-phenotype associations. We advocate for the use of methods\nthat work with continuous traits directly rather than collapsing them to binary\nrepresentations. We examine the strengths and limitations of different\napproaches to modeling genetic replication, highlighting the importance of\nexplicit modeling of evolutionary processes. Finally, we outline promising\nfuture directions, including the integration of population-level variation, as\nwell as epigenetic and environmental information. No one method is likely to\nidentify all genomic regions of interest, so we encourage users to apply\nmultiple methods that are capable of detecting a wide range of associations.\nThe overall aim of this review is to provide practitioners a roadmap for\nunderstanding and applying PhyloG2P methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel discovery of a symmetry-breaking effect in porous\nmedia with porosity between 0.8-0.9, which we are referring to as the\nintermediate porosity flow regime. Using large eddy simulation, we studied how\nheat transfer and turbulent convection occurs within these materials at a\nmicroscopic level. We observed symmetry-breaking in porous structures made of\nregularly spaced circular cylinders, a common design in heat exchangers,\nimmediately following the laminar to turbulent flow transition between Reynolds\nnumbers of 37 and 100. Asymmetric patterns persisted up to Reynolds numbers of\n1,000. The initial breakdown of symmetry occurs through a Hopf bifurcation,\ncreating an oscillating flow pattern as shear layers interact around the solid\nobstacles. When the flow becomes turbulent, random variations in the timing of\nvortex oscillations (caused by the secondary instability) create asymmetric\ndistributions of fluid velocity and temperature throughout the porous space.\nThis leads to the formation of alternating channels with high and low velocity\nfluid flow. At the macroscale level, this loss of symmetry creates residual\ntransverse drag force components and asymmetric heat flux distribution on the\nsolid obstacle surfaces. Interestingly, the oscillating flow pattern promotes\nattached flow on the circular cylinder surfaces, which enhances heat transfer\nfrom the cylinders to the fluid. We observe that this secondary flow\ninstability is the primary mechanism of enhanced turbulent heat flux from\nporous media with circular cylinders compared to those with square cylinders.",

As KD is a type of\nlearned label smoothing regularization (LSR), we first conduct a theoretical\nanalysis showing that the teacher's knowledge from the in-context samples is a\ncrucial contributor to regularize the student training with the corresponding\nsamples. Buttressed by the analysis, we propose a novel in-context knowledge\ndistillation (IC-KD) framework that shows its superiority across diverse KD\nparadigms (offline, online, and teacher-free KD). Firstly, we construct a\nfeature memory bank from the teacher model and retrieve in-context samples for\neach corresponding sample through retrieval-based learning.

While\nlower bounds for consensus have been obtained for most of the standard\ndistributed computing models, the design of lower bounds for $k$-set agreement\nwith $k>1$ is notoriously known to be much more difficult, and remains open for\nmany models. The main techniques for designing lower bounds for k-set agreement\nwith $k>1$ use tools from algebraic topology.\n  The algebraic topology tools are difficult to manipulate, and require a lot\nof care for avoiding mistakes.

The framework of ray-tracing is adopted to\ninvestigate the optical appearance of the HBH, thus the trajectories of light\nrays around the HBH can be classified into three emissions: direct, lensed and\nphoton ring.

By leveraging the strengths of both PQC and\nECC, this scheme aims to overcome the challenges in V2X communication. PQC is\nused to establish a security level resistant to quantum computing attacks,\nwhile ECC is utilized to establish anonymous certificates and reduce packet\nlength to meet the requirements of V2X communication.

In\nthe first, we show that the cumulative distribution of finitely many dependent\nand non-identically distributed Bernouli tests is bounded by the cumulative\ndistribution of some binomial distribution. In the second, we establish a close\nrelationship between probability trees and the real line, showing that Borel,\nmeasurable sets, and their measures can be preserved, as well as other\ncombinatorial properties. Finally, in set theory, we establish that the null\nideal associated with suitable probability trees is Tukey equivalent to the\nnull ideal on $[0, 1]$. This leads to a new elementary proof of the fact that\nthe null ideal of a free $\\sigma$-finite Borel measure on a Polish space is\nTukey equivalent with the null ideal of $\\mathbb{R}$, which supports that the\nassociated cardinal characteristics remain invariant across the spaces in which\nthey are defined.",

To overcome these challenges, we propose an inherently\ntransparent model architecture called Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs),\nwhich enable compositional and interpretable predictions through logical\nreasoning.

To train NPCs,\nwe introduce a three-stage training algorithm comprising attribute recognition,\ncircuit construction, and joint optimization.

Specifically, to comprehensively understand the condition\nof patients, in addition to constructing encoders for histopathology images and\ngenomic expression profiles respectively, UMPSNet further integrates four types\nof important meta data (demographic information, cancer type information,\ntreatment protocols, and diagnosis results) into text templates, and then\nintroduces a text encoder to extract textual features. In addition, the optimal\ntransport OT-based attention mechanism is utilized to align and fuse features\nof different modalities. Furthermore, a guided soft mixture of experts (GMoE)\nmechanism is introduced to effectively address the issue of distribution\ndifferences among multiple cancer datasets.

    "abstract": "Achieving high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from monocular video remains\nchallenging due to the inherent limitations of traditional methods like\nStructure-from-Motion (SfM) and monocular SLAM in accurately capturing scene\ndetails. While differentiable rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRF) address some of these challenges, their high computational costs\nmake them unsuitable for real-time applications. Additionally, existing 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods often focus on photometric consistency,\nneglecting geometric accuracy and failing to exploit SLAM's dynamic depth and\npose updates for scene refinement. We propose a framework integrating dense\nSLAM with 3DGS for real-time, high-fidelity dense reconstruction. Our approach\nintroduces SLAM-Informed Adaptive Densification, which dynamically updates and\ndensifies the Gaussian model by leveraging dense point clouds from SLAM.\nAdditionally, we incorporate Geometry-Guided Optimization, which combines\nedge-aware geometric constraints and photometric consistency to jointly\noptimize the appearance and geometry of the 3DGS scene representation, enabling\ndetailed and accurate SLAM mapping reconstruction. Experiments on the Replica\nand TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results among monocular systems. Specifically, our method\nachieves a PSNR of 36.864, SSIM of 0.985, and LPIPS of 0.040 on Replica,\nrepresenting improvements of 10.7%, 6.4%, and 49.4%, respectively, over the\nprevious SOTA. On TUM-RGBD, our method outperforms the closest baseline by\n10.2%, 6.6%, and 34.7% in the same metrics. These results highlight the\npotential of our framework in bridging the gap between photometric and\ngeometric dense 3D scene representations, paving the way for practical and\nefficient monocular dense reconstruction.",

Simulation results for decoy-BB84 and\nmeasurement-device-independent (MDI) protocols using Cascade are consistent\nwith the theoretical analysis. The farther the transmission distance, the\ngreater the growth rate of SKR.

In this work, we aim to\ndetermine the extent of self-similarity in 2D halo dynamics and the factors\nleading to deviations from it by studying numerical simulations of\nmonolithically growing CDM halos. We have adapted the Fillmore and Goldreich\n(FG) self-similar solutions assuming cylindrical symmetry to data from 2D\nVlasov-Poisson (ColDICE package) simulations of CDM halos seeded by sine wave\ninitial conditions. We measured trajectories in position and phase-space, mass\nand density profiles and compared these to predictions from the FG model. We\nfind that after turn-around and subsequent shell crossing, particles undergo a\nperiod of relaxation, typically about 1-2 oscillations about the center before\nthey start to trace the self-similar fits and continue to do so as long as\ntheir orbits are predominantly radial. Overplotting the trajectories from\ndifferent snapshots in scale-free position-time and phase spaces shows\nstrikingly good superposition, a defining feature of self-similarity. The\nradial density profiles measured from simulations: $\\rho \\propto r^{-\\alpha},\n\\alpha = 0.9 - 1.0$ are consistent with FG's prediction $\\alpha=1$ for 2D\nhalos. Deviations from the model, on the other hand, are evidently linked to\nrelaxation, inhibited motion due to periodic boundaries, transverse motion in\nthe halo interior, and deficit of infalling mass in limited simulation volume.\nIt could not be conclusively established if the halos tend to grow circular\nover time.

The improvement yields novel results of evolutionary\ncombinatorial optimization, including a briefer proof for the time complexity\nupper bound in the case of (1+1) EA for the Onemax problem, two tighter time\ncomplexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of (1+$\\lambda$) EA\nfor the knapsack problem with favorably correlated weights and a closed-form\nexpression of time complexity upper bound in the case of (1+$\\lambda$) EA for\ngeneral $k$-MAX-SAT problems. The results indicate that the practical running\ntime aligns with the theoretical results, verifying that the multiple-gain\nmodel is more general for running-time analysis of evolutionary combinatorial\noptimization than state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Cascaded models are multi-scale generative models with a marked capacity for\nproducing perceptually impressive samples at high resolutions. In this work, we\nshow that they can also be excellent likelihood models, so long as we overcome\na fundamental difficulty with probabilistic multi-scale models: the\nintractability of the likelihood function. Chiefly, in cascaded models each\nintermediary scale introduces extraneous variables that cannot be tractably\nmarginalized out for likelihood evaluation. This issue vanishes by modeling the\ndiffusion process on latent spaces induced by a class of transformations we\ncall hierarchical volume-preserving maps, which decompose spatially structured\ndata in a hierarchical fashion without introducing local distortions in the\nlatent space. We demonstrate that two such maps are well-known in the\nliterature for multiscale modeling: Laplacian pyramids and wavelet transforms.\nNot only do such reparameterizations allow the likelihood function to be\ndirectly expressed as a joint likelihood over the scales, we show that the\nLaplacian pyramid and wavelet transform also produces significant improvements\nto the state-of-the-art on a selection of benchmarks in likelihood modeling,\nincluding density estimation, lossless compression, and out-of-distribution\ndetection. Investigating the theoretical basis of our empirical gains we\nuncover deep connections to score matching under the Earth Mover's Distance\n(EMD), which is a well-known surrogate for perceptual similarity.

Recent studies have incorporated\ngraph learning techniques to extract detailed information from provenance\ngraphs, enabling the detection of attacks with greater granularity.\nNevertheless, existing studies have largely overlooked the continuous yet\nsubtle temporal variations in the structure of provenance graphs, which may\ncorrespond to surreptitious perturbation anomalies in ongoing APT attacks.\nTherefore, we introduce TFLAG, an advanced anomaly detection framework that for\nthe first time integrates the structural dynamic extraction capabilities of\ntemporal graph model with the anomaly delineation abilities of deviation\nnetworks to pinpoint covert attack activities in provenance graphs. This\nself-supervised integration framework leverages the graph model to extract\nneighbor interaction data under continuous temporal changes from historical\nbenign behaviors within provenance graphs, while simultaneously utilizing\ndeviation networks to accurately distinguish authentic attack activities from\nfalse positive deviations due to unexpected subtle perturbations. The\nexperimental results indicate that, through a comprehensive design that\nutilizes both attribute and temporal information, it can accurately identify\nthe time windows associated with APT attack behaviors without prior knowledge\n(e.g., labeled data samples), demonstrating superior accuracy compared to\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods in differentiating between attack events and\nsystem false positive events.",

Human videos offer a scalable alternative, but it\nremains difficult to directly train IL policies from them due to the lack of\nrobot action labels. To address this, we propose to represent actions as\nshort-horizon 2D trajectories on an image. These actions, or motion tracks,\ncapture the predicted direction of motion for either human hands or robot\nend-effectors. We instantiate an IL policy called Motion Track Policy (MT-pi)\nwhich receives image observations and outputs motion tracks as actions. By\nleveraging this unified, cross-embodiment action space, MT-pi completes tasks\nwith high success given just minutes of human video and limited additional\nrobot demonstrations. At test time, we predict motion tracks from two camera\nviews, recovering 6DoF trajectories via multi-view synthesis. MT-pi achieves an\naverage success rate of 86.5% across 4 real-world tasks, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art IL baselines which do not leverage human data or our action\nspace by 40%, and generalizes to scenarios seen only in human videos.

The resource manager models quantum chips into\ndifferent abstract layers, including the real quantum processing unit (QPU),\nthe standard QPU (StdQPU), the substructure QPU (SubQPU), and the virtual QPU\n(VQPU), and stores this information in a quantum computing resource\nvirtualization database, thus realizing the unified management of quantum\ncomputing devices.

It provides hardware-aware compilation algorithms that account for\nquantum gate noise and qubit coupling structures. By selecting the most\nsuitable computing resources from the VQPU library, the compiler maps quantum\ntasks to the optimal qubit regions of the target device. We validated the\neffectiveness of the QSteed on the superconducting devices of the Quafu quantum\ncloud computing cluster.

    "abstract": "Here we analyse ways to achieve deep subthreshold parametric squeezing of\nfluctuations beyond the $-6$~dB limit of single degree-of-freedom parametric\nresonators. One way of accomplishing this is via a lock-in amplifier feedback\nloop. Initially, we calculate the phase-dependent parametric amplification with\nfeedback of an added ac signal. In one approach, we use the averaging method to\nobtain the amplification gain, while in the second approach, we obtain the ac\nresponse of the parametric amplifier with feedback using the harmonic balance\nmethod. In this latter approach, the feedback is proportional to an integral\nterm that emulates the cosine quadrature output of a lock-in amplifier\nmultiplied by a sine at the same tone of the lock-in. We find that the gain\nobtained via these two methods are the same whenever the integration time span\nof the integral is a multiple of the tone period. When this is not the case, we\ncan obtain considerable deamplification. Finally, we analyse the response of\nthe parametric resonator with feedback, described by this integro-differential\nmodel, to an added white noise in the frequency domain. Using this model we\nwere able to calculate, in addition to squeezing, the noise spectral density in\nthis resonator with feedback. Very strong squeezing or cooling can be obtained.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we give a new approximate dynamic programming (ADP) method to\nsolve large-scale Markov decision programming (MDP) problem. In comparison with\nmany classic ADP methods which have large number of constraints, we formulate\nan alternating ADP (AADP) which have both small number of constraints and small\nnumber of variables by approximating the decision variables (instead of the\nobjective functions in classic ADP) and write the dual of the exact LP. Also,\nto get the basis functions, we use kernel approximation instead of empirical\nchoice of basis functions, which can efficiently learn nonlinear functions\nwhile retaining the expressive power. By treating option pricing as an\nlarge-scale MDP problem, we apply the AADP method to give an empirical proof\nthat American call option will not be exercised earlier if the underlying stock\nhas no dividend payment, which is a classic result proved by Black-Scholes\nmodel. We also make comparison of pricing options in high-dimensional with some\nbenchmark option pricing papers which use the classic ADP to give upper and\nlower bound of the option price.",

    "abstract": "W Serpentis is an eclipsing binary system and the prototype of the Serpentid\nclass of variable stars. These are interacting binaries experiencing intense\nmass transfer and mass loss. However, the identities and properties of both\nstars in W Ser remain a mystery. Here we present an observational analysis of\nhigh quality, visible-band spectroscopy made with the Apache Point Observatory\n3.5 m telescope and ARCES spectrograph plus the first near-IR, long-baseline\ninterferometric observations obtained with the CHARA Array. We present examples\nof the appearance and radial velocities of the main spectral components:\nprominent emission lines, strong shell absorption lines, and weak absorption\nlines. We show that some of the weak absorption features are associated with\nthe cool mass donor, and we present the first radial velocity curve for the\ndonor star. The donor's absorption lines are rotationally broadened, and we\nderive a ratio of donor to gainer mass of 0.36 +/- 0.09 based on the\nassumptions that the donor fills its Roche lobe and rotates synchronously with\nthe orbit. We use a fit of the ASAS light curve to determine the orbital\ninclination and mass estimates of 2.0 and 5.7 solar masses for the donor and\ngainer, respectively. The partially resolved interferometric measurements of\norbital motion are consistent with our derived orbital properties and the\ndistance from Gaia EDR3. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that the gainer is\nenshrouded in an opaque disk that channels the mass transfer stream into an\noutflow through the L3 region and into a circumbinary disk.",

    "abstract": "The global AI surge demands crowdworkers from diverse languages and cultures.\nThey are pivotal in labeling data for enabling global AI systems. Despite\nglobal significance, research has primarily focused on understanding the\nperspectives and experiences of US and India crowdworkers, leaving a notable\ngap. To bridge this, we conducted a survey with 100 crowdworkers across 16\nLatin American and Caribbean countries. We discovered that these workers\nexhibited pride and respect for their digital labor, with strong support and\nadmiration from their families. Notably, crowd work was also seen as a stepping\nstone to financial and professional independence. Surprisingly, despite wanting\nmore connection, these workers also felt isolated from peers and doubtful of\nothers' labor quality. They resisted collaboration and gender-based tools,\nvaluing gender-neutrality. Our work advances HCI understanding of Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean crowdwork, offering insights for digital resistance\ntools for the region.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly being used in the healthcare\ndomain, particularly for the development of personalized health adaptive\ninterventions. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), we are\ninterested in using LLMs to update the RL policy in real time, with the goal of\naccelerating personalization. We use the text-based user preference to\ninfluence the action selection on the fly, in order to immediately incorporate\nthe user preference. We use the term \"user preference\" as a broad term to refer\nto a user personal preference, constraint, health status, or a statement\nexpressing like or dislike, etc. Our novel approach is a hybrid method that\ncombines the LLM response and the RL action selection to improve the RL policy.\nGiven an LLM prompt that incorporates the user preference, the LLM acts as a\nfilter in the typical RL action selection. We investigate different prompting\nstrategies and action selection strategies. To evaluate our approach, we\nimplement a simulation environment that generates the text-based user\npreferences and models the constraints that impact behavioral dynamics. We show\nthat our approach is able to take into account the text-based user preferences,\nwhile improving the RL policy, thus improving personalization in adaptive\nintervention.",
