    "abstract": "Protected user-level libraries have been proposed as a way to allow mutually\ndistrusting applications to safely share kernel-bypass services. In this paper,\nwe identify and solve several previously unaddressed obstacles to realizing\nthis design and identify several optimization opportunities. First, to preserve\nthe kernel's ability to reclaim failed processes, protected library functions\nmust complete in modest, bounded time. We show how to move unbounded waits\noutside the library itself, enabling synchronous interaction among processes\nwithout the need for polling. Second, we show how the bounded time requirement\ncan be leveraged to achieve lower and more stable latency for inter-process\ninteractions. Third, we observe that prior work on protected libraries is\nvulnerable to a buffer unmapping attack; we prevent this attack by preventing\napplications from removing pages that they share with the protected library.\nFourth, we show how a trusted daemon can respond to asynchronous events and\ndynamically divide work with application threads in a protected library.\n  By extending and improving the protected library model, our work provides a\nnew way to structure OS services, combining the advantages of kernel bypass and\nmicrokernels. We present a set of safety and performance guidelines for\ndevelopers of protected libraries, and a set of recommendations for developers\nof future protected library operating systems. We demonstrate the convenience\nand performance of our approach with a prototype version of the DDS\ncommunication service. To the best of our knowledge, this prototype represents\nthe first successful sharing of a kernel-bypass NIC among mutually untrusting\napplications. Relative to the commercial FastDDS implementation, we achieve\napproximately 50\\% lower latency and up to 7x throughput, with lower CPU\nutilization.",

    "abstract": "Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of\nthe aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,\naccess to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often\nlimited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved\nareas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative\nbut is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most\nrelevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each\npatient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on\na fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional\nimaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from\n2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using\nonly 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results\ndemonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS\ndiagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and\npersonalized.

Here,\nwe use Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) observations of atmospheric radiance to\nestimate these physical and radiative properties.

The similarity in sizes of $\\text{CO}_{\\text{2}}$ ice particles in both\nhemispheres may be due to the fact that $\\text{CO}_{\\text{2}}$ clouds tend to\nform near the same pressure level in each hemisphere, despite the higher\nsurface pressures in the north. We use a simplified convective cooling model to\nshow that the small effective variance we derive may be a consequence of the\nfact that $\\text{CO}_{\\text{2}}$ is also the dominant atmospheric constituent\non Mars, which allows $\\text{CO}_{\\text{2}}$ ice particles to reach sizes\nupwards of 10 $\\mu$m within seconds. At the same time, the fact that the\nMartian atmosphere is so thin means that large particles fall rapidly to the\nsurface, reducing the range of particle sizes that can remain in the atmosphere\nfor any extended period of time.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as a building block\nin data systems to process large text datasets. To do so, LLM model providers\noffer multiple LLMs with different sizes, spanning various cost-quality\ntrade-offs when processing text at scale. Top-of-the-line LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o,\nClaude Sonnet) operate with high accuracy but are prohibitively expensive when\nprocessing many records. To avoid high costs, more affordable but lower quality\nLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku) can be used to process records, but we\nneed to ensure that the overall accuracy does not deviate substantially from\nthat of the top-of-the-line LLMs. The model cascade framework provides a\nblueprint to manage this trade-off, by using the confidence of LLMs in their\noutput (e.g., log-probabilities) to decide on which records to use the\naffordable LLM. However, existing solutions following this framework provide\nonly marginal cost savings and weak theoretical guarantees because of poor\nestimation of the quality of the affordable LLM's outputs. We present BARGAIN,\na method that judiciously uses affordable LLMs in data processing to\nsignificantly reduce cost while providing strong theoretical guarantees on the\nsolution quality. BARGAIN employs a novel adaptive sampling strategy and\nstatistical estimation procedure that uses data and task characteristics and\nbuilds on recent statistical tools to make accurate estimations with tight\ntheoretical guarantees. Variants of BARGAIN can support guarantees on accuracy,\nprecision, or recall of the output. Experimental results across 8 real-world\ndatasets show that BARGAIN reduces cost, on average, by up to 86% more than\nstate-of-the-art, while providing stronger theoretical guarantees on accuracy\nof output, with similar gains when guaranteeing a desired level of precision or\nrecall.",

Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing\nsynthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing\nvariation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of\nconfounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide\npoint estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed\nestimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the\nsource data). This denies users the ability to express uncertainty over\nparameter values and removes the potential for posterior inference, potentially\nleading to unreliable estimator comparisons. We introduce simulation-based\ninference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative\nparameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source\ndataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies\nparameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with\nthe source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves\nthe reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,\nwhich supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking\nunder uncertainty.",

Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising\npathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a\n\"unimodal bias\" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of\ndecision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic\nconstraints, often resulting in \"decision deadlocks.\" To overcome this\nlimitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic\nmodels into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous\nconflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional\nmethods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its\npolicy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it\nto generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core\narchitecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),\na training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent\nprogresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive\nsimulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly\noutperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the\nmost challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high\nsuccess rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions\n(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,\nsignificantly enhancing the system's safety margin.

Using exciton-polarons as a probe, we directly\nmeasure the intrinsic polarization field and extract the interlayer potential.\nFinally, we demonstrate electric-field-driven symmetric switching of the\nvalence band maximum, attributed to ferroelectric domain switching. These\nresults provide a complete experimental picture of the band alignment,\nspontaneous polarization field, and domain dynamics of R-stacked WSe$_2$,\nestablishing key parameters to understand twisted bilayers and enabling new\nferroelectric and excitonic device opportunities.",

    "abstract": "The rank aggregation problem, which has many real-world applications, refers\nto the process of combining multiple input rankings into a single aggregated\nranking. In dynamic settings, where new rankings arrive over time, efficiently\nupdating the aggregated ranking is essential. This paper develops a fast,\ntheoretically and practically efficient dynamic rank aggregation algorithm.\nFirst, we develop the LR-Aggregation algorithm, built on top of the LR-tree\ndata structure, which is itself modeled on the LR-distance, a novel and\nequivalent take on the classical Spearman's footrule distance. We then analyze\nthe theoretical efficiency of the Pick-A-Perm algorithm, and show how it can be\ncombined with the LR-aggregation algorithm using another data structure that we\ndevelop. We demonstrate through experimental evaluations that LR-Aggregation\nproduces close to optimal solutions in practice. We show that Pick-A-Perm has a\ntheoretical worst case approximation guarantee of 2. We also show that both the\nLR-Aggregation and Pick-A-Perm algorithms, as well as the methodology for\ncombining them can be run in $O(n \\log n)$ time. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first fast, near linear time rank aggregation algorithm in the\ndynamic setting, having both a theoretical approximation guarantee, and\nexcellent practical performance (much better than the theoretical guarantee).",

    "abstract": "The small scale of urban farms and the commercial availability of low-cost\nrobots (such as the FarmBot) that automate simple tending tasks enable an\naccessible platform for plant phenotyping. We have used a FarmBot with a custom\ncamera end-effector to estimate strawberry plant flower pose (for robotic\npollination) from acquired 3D point cloud models. We describe a novel algorithm\nthat translates individual occupancy grids along orthogonal axes of a point\ncloud to obtain 2D images corresponding to the six viewpoints. For each image,\n2D object detection models for flowers are used to identify 2D bounding boxes\nwhich can be converted into the 3D space to extract flower point clouds. Pose\nestimation is performed by fitting three shapes (superellipsoids, paraboloids\nand planes) to the flower point clouds and compared with manually labeled\nground truth. Our method successfully finds approximately 80% of flowers\nscanned using our customized FarmBot platform and has a mean flower pose error\nof 7.7 degrees, which is sufficient for robotic pollination and rivals previous\nresults.

Leveraging Voronoi partitioning, the overall coverage is reformulated\nas a sum of local contributions, enabling mobile sensors to optimize their\npositions using only local information. The strategy adopts the Elfes model to\ncapture detection uncertainty and introduces a dynamic step size based on the\ngradient of the local coverage, ensuring movements adaptive to regional\nimportance. Obstacle awareness is integrated via visibility constraints,\nprojecting sensor positions to unobstructed paths. A threshold-based decision\nrule ensures movement occurs only for sufficiently large coverage gains, with\nconvergence achieved when all sensors and their neighbors stop at a local\nmaximum configuration. Simulations demonstrate improved coverage over static\ndeployments, highlighting scalability and practicality for real-world\napplications.",

    "abstract": "It is quite familiar that Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation can be rewritten in terms\nof fluid-type equations, called Madelung equations. However one term in these\nfluid equations, the so called `quantum potential` is quite complicated.\nIndeed, D\\\"{u}rr complains that the quantum potential is `neither simple nor\nnatural` \\cite{Durr1996}. Thus it may appear a hopeless task to imagine a fluid\nwith such properties that would lead to the Madelung equations, and more\nspecifically, to the quantum potential. We prove the opposite. We make a model\nwith \\textit{two} interacting fluids, instead of one. Then we consider a\nprocess of mutual diffusion between the fluids. This leads quite naturally to\nthe Madelung fluid equations \\textit{including} the quantum potential for one\nof the fluids. In addition, we model the particle as a point-like object, that\nmoves inside this particular fluid. We require that it moves with the\n\\textit{same} velocity as the \\textit{local velocity of this fluid}. Then the\nguiding equation of Bohmian mechanics follows directly. From this equation we\nderive Born's rule. Our interpretation of that result is that \\textit{the\nparticle is part of the fluid, a kind of singularity in it}. Finally, we answer\nseveral possible objections against the model.",

Existing indifference-zone (IZ) procedures introduce a\nfixed tolerance level, which denotes how much deviation the decision-maker is\nwilling to accept from the threshold in the constraint. These procedures are\ndeveloped under the assumption that all systems' performance measures are\nexactly the tolerance level away from the threshold, leading to unnecessary\nsimulations. In contrast, IZ-free procedures, which eliminate the tolerance\nlevel, perform well when systems' performance measures are far from the\nthreshold. However, they may significantly underperform compared to IZ\nprocedures when systems' performance measures are close to the threshold. To\naddress these challenges, we propose the Indifference-Zone Relaxation (IZR)\nprocedure, IZR introduces a set of relaxed tolerance levels and utilizes two\nsubroutines for each level: one to identify systems that are clearly feasible\nand the other to exclude those that are clearly infeasible. We also develop the\nIZR procedure with estimation (IZE), which introduces two relaxed tolerance\nlevels for each system and constraint: one matching the original tolerance\nlevel and the other based on an estimate of the system's performance measure.\nBy employing different tolerance levels, these procedures facilitate early\nfeasibility determination with statistical validity.

Traditional control systems, which are human\nand optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving\ncontext, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control\nstrategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning\nframework for real-time, scalable grid management.

A Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information\nwithin the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and\nenhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and\npotential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized\napproaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global\nobservations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level\nagent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment\nconstructed through the GNN.

However, outflows\ncan also create pure emission lines, especially at optical wavelengths.\nTherefore, developing other outflow diagnostics for these types of lines is\nworthwhile. With this in mind, we construct a systematic grid of 3645 synthetic\nwind-formed H-alpha line profiles for CVs with the radiative transfer code\nSIROCCO. Our grid yields a variety of line shapes: symmetric, asymmetric,\nsingle- to quadruple-peaked, and even P-Cygni profiles. About 20% of these\nlines -- our `Gold' sample -- have strengths and widths consistent with\nobservations. We use this grid to test a recently proposed method for\nidentifying wind-formed emission lines based on deviations in the wing profile\nshape: the `excess equivalent width diagnostic diagram'. We find that our\n`Gold' sample can preferentially populate the suggested `wind regions' of this\ndiagram. However, the method is highly sensitive to the adopted definition of\nthe line profile `wing'. Hence, we propose a refined definition based on the\nfull-width at half maximum to improve the interpretability of the diagnostic\ndiagram. Furthermore, we define an approximate scaling relation for the\nstrengths of wind-formed CV emission lines in terms of the outflow parameters.\nThis relation provides a fast way to assess whether -- and what kind of --\noutflow can produce an observed emission line.

    "abstract": "Previous works in the differential privacy literature that allow users to\nchoose their privacy levels typically operate under the heterogeneous\ndifferential privacy (HDP) framework with the simplifying assumption that user\ndata and privacy levels are not correlated. Firstly, we demonstrate that the\nstandard HDP framework falls short when user data and privacy demands are\nallowed to be correlated. Secondly, to address this shortcoming, we propose an\nalternate framework, Add-remove Heterogeneous Differential Privacy (AHDP), that\njointly accounts for user data and privacy preference. We show that AHDP is\nrobust to possible correlations between data and privacy. Thirdly, we formalize\nthe guarantees of the proposed AHDP framework through an operational hypothesis\ntesting perspective. The hypothesis testing setup may be of independent\ninterest in analyzing other privacy frameworks as well. Fourthly, we show that\nthere exists non-trivial AHDP mechanisms that notably do not require prior\nknowledge of the data-privacy correlations. We propose some such mechanisms and\napply them to core statistical tasks such as mean estimation, frequency\nestimation, and linear regression. The proposed mechanisms are simple to\nimplement with minimal assumptions and modeling requirements, making them\nattractive for real-world use. Finally, we empirically evaluate proposed AHDP\nmechanisms, highlighting their trade-offs using LLM-generated synthetic\ndatasets, which we release for future research.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to open-ended,\ninterpretive annotation tasks, such as thematic analysis by researchers or\ngenerating feedback on student work by teachers. These tasks involve free-text\nannotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives\n(e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether\nLLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is\nchallenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of\nsimilarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable\nevaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied\ntask, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing\nexpert similarity ratings via a \"pick-the-odd-one-out\" triplet judgment task,\nand (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones\n(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human\nbenchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets\n(interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based\nmetrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful\nto experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with\nexpert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and\nvector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm\nfor evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing\nresponsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive investment in artificial intelligence, 95% of enterprises\nreport no measurable profit impact from AI deployments (MIT, 2025). In this\ntheoretical paper, we argue that this gap reflects paradigmatic lock-in that\nchannels AI into incremental optimization rather than structural\ntransformation. Using a cross-case analysis, we propose a 2x2 framework that\nreconceptualizes AI strategy along two independent dimensions: the degree of\ntransformation achieved (incremental to transformational) and the treatment of\nhuman contribution (reduced to amplified). The framework surfaces four patterns\nnow dominant in practice: individual augmentation, process automation,\nworkforce substitution, and a less deployed frontier of collaborative\nintelligence. Evidence shows that the first three dimensions reinforce legacy\nwork models and yield localized gains without durable value capture. Realizing\ncollaborative intelligence requires three mechanisms: complementarity (pairing\ndistinct human and machine strengths), co-evolution (mutual adaptation through\ninteraction), and boundary-setting (human determination of ethical and\nstrategic parameters). Complementarity and boundary-setting are observable in\nregulated and high-stakes domains; co-evolution is largely absent, which helps\nexplain limited system-level impact. Our findings in a case study analysis\nillustrated that advancing toward collaborative intelligence requires material\nrestructuring of roles, governance, and data architecture rather than\nadditional tools. The framework reframes AI transformation as an organizational\ndesign challenge: moving from optimizing the division of labor between humans\nand machines to architecting their convergence, with implications for operating\nmodels, workforce development, and the future of work.",

As a first step, we revisit the LMI case and weaken\nthe conditions necessary for the key AD theorem presented in [Mathematical\nProgramming 190(1-2) (2021), pp 105-134]. This modification allows the method\nto be applied to a broader range of problems. Next, we propose a practical\nprocedure that reduces the number of additional variables, drawing on physical\ninterpretations often found in structural optimization applications. For the\nPMI case, we explore two distinct approaches to combine the AD technique with\nmSOS hierarchies. One approach involves applying AD to the original POP before\nimplementing the mSOS relaxation. The other approach applies AD directly to the\nmSOS relaxations of the POP.

Evidence supports the existence of buffering feedbacks on Earth,\nbut whether these same feedbacks are active on other Earth-like planets remains\nuntested, as does the habitable zone hypothesis. While feedbacks are central to\nthe habitable zone concept, one does not guarantee the other-i.e., it is\npossible that a planet may maintain stable surface conditions at a given solar\nluminosity without following the predicted $CO_2$ trend across the entire\nhabitable zone. Forthcoming exoplanet observations will provide an opportunity\nto test both ideas. In anticipation of this and to avoid premature conclusions\nbased on insufficient data, we develop statistical tests to determine how many\nobservations are needed to detect and quantify planetary-scale feedbacks. Our\nmodel-agnostic approach assumes only the most generic prediction that holds for\nany buffering feedback, allowing the observations to constrain feedback\nbehavior. That can then inform next-level questions about what specific\nphysical, chemical, and/or biological feedback processes may be consistent with\nobservational data. We find that [23, 74](95% CI) observations are required to\ndetect feedback behavior within a given solar luminosity range, depending on\nthe sampling order of planets. These results are from tests using conservative\nerror tolerance-a measure used to capture the risk of false positives. Reducing\nerror tolerance lowers the chance of false positives but requires more\nobservations; increasing it reduces the required sample size but raises\nuncertainty in estimating population characteristics.

    "abstract": "We propose that galaxy structural changes - and the rapid rise of a\npopulation of galaxies with early-type morphologies at cosmic noon ($1<z<3$) -\ncan be explained with EASE: Early, Accelerated, Secular Evolution. The\nmechanism relies on the torques exerted by stellar spirals in late-type\ngalaxies that are present and active at $z>1.5$ as revealed by JWST/NIRCam. The\nprocess is at once secular, because the transformative structural changes\n(heating, compaction, bulge formation) occur over many ($\\approx10-30$) orbital\nperiods, but accelerated, because orbital times were significantly shorter than\nat the present day. In a first application, we take galaxy effective radius as\na proxy for galaxy structure and, using new measurements of the abundance and\nproperties of stellar spirals observed in a collection of JWST deep fields,\nshow that EASE predicts a distribution of early-type sizes that is smaller than\nlate-type galaxies and consistent with what is observed. The success of EASE\nrelies on an updated picture of the influence of spiral arms, in which\ntransience plays a key role. We present a new calculation of the characteristic\nwave equation in the fluid approximation that applies to steady and non-steady\nopen spirals beyond the more traditional tight-winding limit. This shows open,\ntransient spirals above the Jeans length growing and decaying on the order of a\ndynamical time in a wider region around and inside corotation than canonical\nsteady spirals. We show that this transient activity spreads out angular\nmomentum gains and losses, and the associated dynamical heating, giving spirals\na more extended influence than a single steady spiral. The ubiquity of spirals\nin star-forming galaxies with $M_*>10^{10.5}M_{\\odot}$ across the redshifts\nwhere early-type galaxies appear in large numbers suggests that EASE can play\nan important role in the morphological transformation of galaxies.",

However, scientific return depends on\naccurate characterisation of the X-ray emitters, requiring high-quality\nmultiwavelength data. This paper presents the identification and classification\nof optical and infrared counterparts to eRASS1 sources using Gaia DR3,\nCatWISE2020, and Legacy Survey DR10 (LS10) with the Bayesian NWAY algorithm and\ntrained priors. Sources were classified as Galactic or extragalactic via a\nMachine Learning model combining optical/IR and X-ray properties, trained on a\nreference sample. For extragalactic LS10 sources, photometric redshifts were\ncomputed using Circlez. Within the LS10 footprint, all 656,614 eROSITA/DR1\nsources have at least one possible optical counterpart; about 570,000 are\nextragalactic and likely AGN. Half are new detections compared to AllWISE,\nGaia, and Quaia AGN catalogues. Gaia and CatWISE2020 counterparts are less\nreliable, due to the surveys shallowness and the limited amount of features\navailable to assess the probability of being an X-ray emitter. In the Galactic\nPlane, where the overdensity of stellar sources also increases the chance of\nassociations, using conservative reliability cuts, we identify approximately\n18,000 Gaia and 55,000 CatWISE2020 extragalactic sources. We release three\nhigh-quality counterpart catalogues, plus the training and validation sets, as\na benchmark for the field. These datasets have many applications, but in\nparticular empower researchers to build AGN samples tailored for completeness\nand purity, accelerating the hunt for the Universe most energetic engines.",

    "abstract": "For a datastream, the change over a short interval is often of low rank. For\nhigh throughput information arranged in matrix format, recomputing an optimal\nSVD approximation after each step is typically prohibitive. Instead,\nincremental and truncated updating strategies are used, which may not scale for\nlarge truncation ranks. Therefore, we propose a set of efficient new algorithms\nthat update a bidiagonal factorization, and which are similarly accurate as the\nSVD methods. In particular, we develop a compact Householder-type algorithm\nthat decouples a sparse part from a low-rank update and has about half the\nmemory requirements of standard bidiagonalization methods. A second algorithm\nbased on Givens rotations has only about 10 flops per rotation and scales\nquadratically with the problem size, compared to a typical cubic scaling. The\nalgorithm is therefore effective for processing high-throughput updates, as we\ndemonstrate in tracking large subspaces of recommendation systems and networks,\nand when compared to well known software such as LAPACK or the incremental SVD.",

    "abstract": "As quantum computing progresses, the need for scalable solutions to address\nlarge-scale computational problems has become critical. Quantum supercomputers\nare the next upcoming frontier by enabling multiple quantum processors to\ncollaborate effectively to solve large-scale computational problems. The\nemergence of quantum supercomputers necessitates an efficient interface to\nmanage the quantum communication protocols between quantum processors. In this\npaper, we propose the Quantum Network Processing Unit (QNPU), which enables\nquantum applications to efficiently scale beyond the capacity of individual\nquantum processors, serving as a critical building block for future quantum\nsupercomputers. The QNPU works alongside the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) in\nour decoupled processing units architecture, where the QPU handles local\nquantum operations while the QNPU manages quantum communication between nodes.\nWe design a comprehensive instruction set architecture (ISA) for the QNPU with\nhigh-level communication protocol abstractions, implemented via\nmicro-operations that manage EPR resources, quantum operations, and classical\ncommunication. To facilitate programming, we introduce DistQASM, which extends\nOpenQASM with distributed quantum operations. We then propose a\nmicroarchitecture featuring both scalar and superscalar QNPU designs to enhance\nperformance for communication-intensive quantum workloads. Finally, we evaluate\nthe performance of our proposed QNPU design with distributed quantum workloads\nand demonstrate that the QNPU significantly improves the efficiency of\ncommunication between quantum nodes, paving the way for quantum supercomputing.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a critical global health issue driven by dietary, physiological,\nand environmental factors, and is strongly associated with chronic diseases\nsuch as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Machine learning has\nemerged as a promising approach for early obesity risk prediction, yet a\ncomparative evaluation of ensemble techniques -- particularly hybrid majority\nvoting and ensemble stacking -- remains limited. This study aims to compare\nhybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk\nprediction, identifying which approach delivers higher accuracy and efficiency.\nThe analysis seeks to highlight the complementary strengths of these ensemble\ntechniques in guiding better predictive model selection for healthcare\napplications. Two datasets were utilized to evaluate three ensemble models:\nMajority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking (with a Multi-Layer\nPerceptron as meta-classifier). A pool of nine Machine Learning (ML)\nalgorithms, evaluated across a total of 50 hyperparameter configurations, was\nanalyzed to identify the top three models to serve as base learners for the\nensemble methods. Preprocessing steps involved dataset balancing, and outlier\ndetection, and model performance was evaluated using Accuracy and F1-Score. On\nDataset-1, weighted hard voting and stacking achieved nearly identical\nperformance (Accuracy: 0.920304, F1: 0.920070), outperforming majority hard\nvoting. On Dataset-2, stacking demonstrated superior results (Accuracy:\n0.989837, F1: 0.989825) compared to majority hard voting (Accuracy: 0.981707,\nF1: 0.981675) and weighted hard voting, which showed the lowest performance.\nThe findings confirm that ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive\ncapability, particularly for complex data distributions, while hybrid majority\nvoting remains a robust alternative.",

We use radial profiles to measure the disk at\nthe ansae and find that the southeast (SE) side of the disk is 4 AU wider than\nthe northwest (NW) side as observed by ALMA.

Since the legacy wireless systems\nwere designed based on often decades-old assumptions about wireless\ninterference, utilizing these new bands will result in interference with the\nexisting legacy users. Many of these legacy wireless devices are used by\ncritical infrastructure networks upon which society depends. There is an urgent\nneed to develop schemes that can protect legacy users from such interference.\nFor many applications, legacy users are located within\ngeographically-constrained regions. Several studies have proposed mitigating\ninterference through the implementation of exclusion zones near these\ngeographically-constrained regions. In contrast to solutions based on\ngeographic exclusion zones, this paper presents a communication theory-based\nsolution. By leveraging knowledge of these geographically-constrained regions,\nwe aim to reduce the interference impact on legacy users. We achieve this by\nincorporating received power constraints, termed as region constraints, in our\nmassive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system design.

    "abstract": "This paper studies a finite-horizon Markov decision problem with\ninformation-theoretic constraints, where the goal is to minimize directed\ninformation from the controlled source process to the control process, subject\nto stage-wise cost constraints, aiming for an optimal control policy. We\npropose a new way of approximating a solution for this problem, which is known\nto be formulated as an unconstrained MDP with a continuous information-state\nusing Q-factors. To avoid the computational complexity of discretizing the\ncontinuous information-state space, we propose a truncated rollout-based\nbackward-forward approximate dynamic programming (ADP) framework. Our approach\nconsists of two phases: an offline base policy approximation over a shorter\ntime horizon, followed by an online rollout lookahead minimization, both\nsupported by provable convergence guarantees. We supplement our theoretical\nresults with a numerical example where we demonstrate the cost improvement of\nthe rollout method compared to a previously proposed policy approximation\nmethod, and the computational complexity observed in executing the offline and\nonline phases for the two methods.",

While their\nextension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video\ncaptioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In\nthis work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in\npixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based\non natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify\nthe shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame\ncan often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any\ntemporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing\ntechniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video\nMLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to\ngrasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,\nMoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging\nthe interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by\nstatic appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We\nfurther establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or\noutperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation\ntechniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.\nOur motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models\nto improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within\nvideos.

This makes\noptimal resource allocation across power, subcarriers, and decoding orders\ncrucial for interference channels (ICs), where neither transmitters nor\nreceivers can cooperate. Current orthogonal multiple access (OMA) methods, as\nwell as non-orthogonal (NOMA) and rate-splitting (RSMA) schemes, rely on fixed\nheuristics for interference management, leading to suboptimal rates, power\ninefficiency, and scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel minPIC\nframework for optimal power, subcarrier, and decoding order allocation in\ngeneral multi-user ICs. Unlike existing methods, minPIC eliminates heuristic\nSIC order assumptions. Despite the convexity of the IC capacity region, fixing\nan SIC order induces non-convexity in resource allocation, traditionally\nrequiring heuristic approximations. We instead introduce a dual-variable-guided\nsorting criterion to identify globally optimal SIC orders, followed by convex\noptimization with auxiliary log-det constraints, efficiently solved via binary\nsearch. We also demonstrate that minPIC could potentially meet the stringent\nhigh-rate, low-power targets of immersive XR and other 6G applications.

    "abstract": "Selecting a quantum feature is an essential step in quantum machine learning.\nThere have been many proposed encoding schemes and proposed techniques to test\nthe efficacy of a scheme. From the perspective of information retention, this\npaper considers the smooth Riemannian geometry structure of a point cloud and\nhow an encoding scheme deforms this geometry once mapped to the space of\nquantum operators, $\\SU(2^N)$. However, a Riemannian manifold structure of the\ncodomain of a quantum feature map has yet to be formalized. Using a ground-up\napproach, this manuscript mathematically establishes a Riemannian geometry for\na general class of Hamiltonian quantum feature maps that are induced from a\nEuclidean embedded manifold. For this ground-up approach, we first derive a\nclosed form of a vector space and a respective metric, and prove there is a 1-1\ncorrespondence from geodesics on the embedded manifold to the codomain of the\nencoding scheme. We then rigorously derive closed form equations to calculate\ncurvature. The paper ends with an example with a subset of the Poincar\\'e\nhalf-plane and two well-used feature maps.",

In\nthis work, we propose a new symbolic method for learning policies based on the\ngeneralization of sampled plans that ensures structural termination and hence\nacyclicity. The proposed learning approach is not based on SAT/ASP, as previous\nsymbolic methods, but on a hitting set algorithm that can effectively handle\nproblems with millions of states, and pools with hundreds of thousands of\nfeatures.

    "abstract": "Ensemble forecasting systems have advanced meteorology by providing\nprobabilistic estimates of future states. Nonetheless, systematic biases often\npersist, making statistical post-processing essential. Traditional parametric\npost-processing techniques and machine learning-based methods can produce\ncalibrated predictive distributions at specific locations and lead times, yet\noften struggle to capture dependencies across forecast dimensions. To address\nthis, multivariate post-processing methods-such as ensemble copula coupling and\nthe Schaake shuffle-are widely applied in a second step to restore realistic\ninter-variable or spatio-temporal dependencies. The aim of this study is the\nmultivariate post-processing of ensemble forecasts using a graph neural network\n(dualGNN) trained with a composite loss function that combines the energy score\n(ES) and the variogram score (VS). The method is evaluated on two datasets:\nWRF-based solar irradiance forecasts over northern Chile and ECMWF visibility\nforecasts for Central Europe. The dualGNN consistently outperforms all\nempirical copula-based post-processed forecasts and shows significant\nimprovements compared to graph neural networks trained solely on either the\ncontinuous ranked probability score or the ES, according to the evaluated\nmultivariate verification metrics. Furthermore, for the WRF forecasts, the\nrank-order structure of the dualGNN forecasts captures valuable dependency\ninformation, enabling a more effective restoration of spatial relationships\nthan either the raw numerical weather prediction ensemble or historical\nobservational rank structures. Notably, incorporating VS into the loss function\nimproved the univariate performance for both target variables compared to\ntraining on ES alone. Moreover, for the visibility forecasts, the ES-VS\ncombination even outperformed the strongest calibrated reference in terms of\nunivariate performance.",

This constraint, which excludes the \"fuzzy\" range of\nultra-light dark matter from comprising all of the DM, relies on an estimate of\nthe heating rate from fuzzy dark matter (FDM) wave interference using linear\nperturbation theory. Here, we compare the results of this perturbative\ncalculation to full Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson simulations of the evolution of star\nparticles in FDM halos. This comparison confirms theoretical expectations that\nFDM heating is stronger in fully nonlinear simulations due to the formation of\na dense central soliton whose fluctuations enhance gravitational perturbations,\nand that bounds on the DM particle mass using this perturbative method are\nindeed conservative. We also show that these bounds are not affected by\npossible tidal stripping, since for dwarf satellites like Segue 1, the tidal\nradius is much larger than the observed size of the galaxy. We further show\nthat the constraints on the mass cannot be evaded by invoking DM\nself-interactions, due to constraints on the self-interaction from large-scale\nstructure. Lastly, we show that if the recently discovered system Ursa Major\nIII/UNIONS I is a galaxy, the observed properties of this object strengthen the\nlower bound on the DM mass by over an order of magnitude, to $m > 8 \\times\n10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, at 95% confidence.

Our findings reveal a consistent degradation in SV\nperformance across all models and codecs as bitrates decrease. Notably, NACs do\nnot fundamentally break SV performance when compared to traditional codecs.\nThey outperform Opus by 6-8% at low-bitrates (< 12 kbps) and remain marginally\nbehind at higher bitrates ($\\approx$ 24 kbps), with an EER increase of only\n0.4-0.7%.

Probe Infrared Mission for\nAstrophysics (PRIMA) is offering a unique opportunity to observe this dust\ncomponent, a crucial ingredient in the energetic balance of the stripped gas.\nWe analyse how the two instruments onboard of PRIMA, PRIMAger (in imaging and\npolarimetric mode) and far-IR enhanced survey spectrometer (FIRESS), can be\nused to observe a selected sample of ram pressure stripped tails detected at\nother frequencies (HI, CO, Halpha, X-rays). These data can be used to determine\nthe relative distribution of the dust component with respect to that of the\nother gas phases, derive its temperature, calculate different gas physical\nparameters (electron density, photoelectric heating efficiency, gas\nmetallicity), and quantify the strength of the turbulent magnetic fields, all\nfundamental parameters used to constrain the most recent hydrodynamic\nsimulations of gas stripping in clusters. The ultimate aim of this research is\nthat of understanding the fate of the cold stripped material once mixed with\nthe surrounding hot medium and study under which condition it can collapse into\ngiant molecular clouds (GMC) to form new stars.",

    "abstract": "We investigate quantum transport in aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers\nfabricated via solution spinning, focusing on the roles of structural\ndimensionality and quantum interference effects. The fibers exhibit metallic\nbehavior at high temperatures, with conductivity increasing monotonically as\nthe temperature decreases from room temperature to approximately 36 K. Below\nthis temperature, the conductivity gradually decreases with further cooling,\nsignaling the onset of quantum conductance corrections associated with\nlocalization effects. Magnetoconductance measurements in both parallel and\nperpendicular magnetic fields exhibit pronounced positive corrections at low\ntemperatures, consistent with weak localization (WL). To determine the\neffective dimensionality of electron transport, we analyzed the data using WL\nmodels in 1D, 2D, and 3D geometries. We found that while the 2D model can\nreproduce the field dependence, it lacks physical meaning in the context of our\nfiber architecture and requires an unphysical scaling factor to match the\nexperimental magnitude. By contrast, we developed a hybrid 3D+1D WL framework\nthat quantitatively captures both the field and temperature dependences using\nrealistic coherence lengths and a temperature-dependent crossover parameter.\nAlthough this combined model also employs a scaling factor for magnitude\ncorrection, it yields a satisfactory fit, reflecting the hierarchical structure\nof CNT fibers in which transport occurs through quasi-1D bundles embedded in a\n3D network. Our results establish a physically grounded model of phase-coherent\ntransport in macroscopic CNT assemblies, providing insights into enhancing\nconductivity for flexible, lightweight power transmission applications.",

In response, synthetic social networks serve as a viable approach\nto support controlled experimentation, but current generators reproduce only\ntopology and overlook attribute-driven homophily and semantic realism.\n  This work proposes a homophily-based algorithm that produces synthetic\nmicroblogging social networks such as X. The model creates a social graph for a\ngiven number of users, integrating semantic affinity among user attributes,\nstochastic variation in link formation, triadic closure to foster clustering,\nand long-range connections to ensure global reachability. A systematic grid\nsearch is used to calibrate five hyperparameters (affinity strength, noise,\nclosure probability, distant link probability, and candidate pool size) for\nreaching five structural values observed in real social networks (density,\nclustering coefficient, LCC proportion, normalized shortest path, and\nmodularity).\n  The framework is validated by generating synthetic OSNs at four scales\n(10^3-10^6 nodes), and benchmarking them against a real-world Bluesky network\ncomprising 4 million users. Comparative results show that the framework\nreliably reproduces the structural properties of the real network.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces alignment games, a new class of zero-sum games modeling\nstrategic interventions where effectiveness depends on alignment with an\nunderlying hidden state. Motivated by operational problems in medical\ndiagnostics, economic sanctions, and resource allocation, this framework\nfeatures two players, a Hider and a Searcher, who choose subsets of a given\nspace. Payoffs are determined by their misalignment (symmetric difference),\nexplicitly modeling the trade-off between commission errors (unnecessary\naction) and omission errors (missed targets), given by a cost function and a\npenalty function, respectively.\n  We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form\nequilibrium solutions that contain interesting mathematical properties based on\nthe game's payoff structure. When cost and penalty functions are unequal,\noptimal strategies are consistently governed by cost-penalty ratios. On the\nunit circle, optimal arc lengths are direct functions of this ratio, and in\ndiscrete games, optimal choice probabilities are proportional to\nelement-specific ratios.\n  When costs are equal, the solutions exhibit rich structural properties and\nsharp threshold behaviors. On the unit interval, this manifests as a geometric\npattern of minimal covering versus maximal non-overlapping strategies. In\ndiscrete games with cardinality constraints, play concentrates on the\nhighest-cost locations, with solutions changing discontinuously as parameters\ncross critical values.\n  Our framework extends the theory of geometric and search games and is general\nenough that classical models, such as Matching Pennies, emerge as special\ncases. These results provide a new theoretical foundation for analyzing the\nstrategic tension between comprehensive coverage and precise targeting under\nuncertainty.",

In this work, we study how these alternatives\ncompare in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To study this trade-off,\nwe instantiate single and multi-agent systems for the complex problems in the\nAppWorld environment using different sized language models.\n  We find that difficulties with long-trajectory learning in smaller language\nmodels (SLMs) limit their performance. Even when trained for specialized roles,\nSLMs fail to learn all subtasks effectively. To address this issue, we\nintroduce a simple progressive sub-task training strategy, which introduces new\nsub-tasks progressively in each training epoch. We find that this novel\nstrategy, analogous to instance level curriculum learning, consistently\nimproves the effectiveness of multi-agents at all configurations. Our Pareto\nanalysis shows that fine-tuned multi-agent systems yield better\neffectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Additional ablations and analyses shows\nthe importance of our progressive training strategy and its ability to reduce\nsubtask error rates.",

While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that\nunder certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which\nwe refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the\nstate-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal\nactions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)\nthe variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to\nzero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations\ncollapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed\nthose aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since\nthe collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise\nangles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:\ncan we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target\nconfiguration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that\nlearning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads\nto the AC. We thus propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method,\nwhich accordingly affixes a synthetic ETF as our action selection layer. ACPG\ninduces the policy DNN to produce such an ideal configuration in the action\nselection layer while remaining optimal. Our experiments across various OpenAI\nGym environments demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into any\ndiscrete PG methods and lead to favorable reward improvements more quickly and\nrobustly.",

Unfortunately, these two assumptions are rarely met in\npractice. To fully avoid these two conditions, we develop a so-called\ncalibration PI (cPI) which leverages estimations by Deep Neural Networks (DNN)\nor kernel methods. Moreover, the cPI can be easily adjusted to capture the\nestimation variability within the prediction procedure, which is a crucial\nerror source often ignored in practice. Under regular assumptions, we verify\nthat our cPI has an asymptotically valid coverage rate. We also demonstrate\nthat cPI based on the kernel method ensures a coverage rate with a high\nprobability when the sample size is large. Besides, with several conditions,\nthe cPI based on DNN works even with finite samples.

Capturing the\ninteraction between spatial and temporal dimensions also helps explain the\nunderlying structure of the data.

Existing visualization tools often focus either on attribute\nrelationships or spatiotemporal analysis, but rarely support both\nsimultaneously. In this paper, we present STRive (SpatioTemporal Rule\nInteractive Visual Explorer), a visual analytics system that enables users to\nuncover and explore spatial and temporal patterns in data. At the core of\nSTRive lies Association Rule Mining (ARM), which we apply to spatiotemporal\ndatasets to generate interpretable and actionable insights. We combine ARM with\nmultiple interactive mechanisms to analyze the extracted relationships.\nAssociation rules serve as interpretable guidance mechanisms for visual\nanalytics by highlighting the meaningful aspects of the data that users should\ninvestigate. Our methodology includes three key steps: rule generation, rule\nclustering, and interactive visualization. STRive offers two modes of analysis.\nThe first operates at the rule cluster level and includes four coordinated\nviews, each showing a different facet of a cluster, including its temporal and\nspatial behavior. The second mode mirrors the first but focuses on individual\nrules within a selected cluster.

We prove that for a random operator $M$, any such data structure requires:\n  $$ t \\geq \\Omega ( \\min \\{ \\log (m/s) , n / \\log s \\} ).$$ This result\novercomes the well-known logarithmic barrier in static data structures [MNSW98,\nSie04, PD06, PTW08, Pat11, DGW19] by using a random linear operator.\nFurthermore, it provides the first significant progress toward confirming a\ndecades-old folklore conjecture: that non-linear pre-processing does not\nsubstantially help in computing most linear operators.\n  A straightforward modification of our proof also yields a wire lower bound of\n$\\Omega(n \\cdot \\log^{1/d}(n))$ for depth-$d$ circuits with arbitrary gates\nthat compute a specific linear operator $M \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^{O(n) \\times n}$,\neven against some small constant advantage over random guessing.

It remains unclear\nhow the local environment -- especially the extreme overdensities of\nprotoclusters -- affects stellar mass assembly at high redshift. The stellar\nmass function (SMF) encodes these processes; comparing SMFs across environments\nreveals differences in evolutionary history. We present the SMF of the Hyperion\nproto-supercluster at $z\\sim2.5$, one of the largest and most massive\nprotostructures known. This dataset provides the most statistically robust SMF\nof a single protostructure at $z>2$. By comparing the SMF of overdense peaks\nwithin Hyperion to the coeval field, we ask: how early, and how strongly, does\na dense environment favor massive galaxies? Using COSMOS2020 photometry with\nground-based and new HST grism spectroscopy, we construct a 3D overdensity map\nthat assigns galaxies to peaks, outskirts, or the field. We perform 100 Monte\nCarlo realizations to propagate redshift and mass uncertainties, and derive\nSMFs normalized to the field. The peaks show a clear excess of massive\ngalaxies: number densities at $\\log(M_*/M_\\odot)\\sim 11$ are ~10x higher than\nthe field, while those at $\\log(M_*/M_\\odot)\\sim 9.5$ are enhanced by only\n~3.5x. By contrast, the outskirts and Hyperion as a whole mirror the field.\nEnvironmental effects on stellar mass growth are thus evident by $z\\sim 2.5$.\nThe densest regions already host galaxies with accelerated growth, while the\nglobal SMF masks this signal. Protostructures therefore begin shaping the\nhigh-mass end of the SMF well before cluster quenching, and may drive the\nelevated star formation at Cosmic Noon.",

    "abstract": "Some massive, quiescent galaxies at z>3 appear to contain considerable\nnumbers of old stars (forming at z>7). Works inferring the star formation\nhistories of at least one such galaxy observed with JWST have suggested that\nthe assembly of so much stellar mass so early may challenge the\nwell-established Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological framework, or else\nindicate extraordinarily high past star formation efficiencies. However, these\nstudies implicitly assume that all the stars in place at the epoch of\nobservation assembled in-situ, i.e. in a single galaxy. In hierarchical models\nlike CDM, massive galaxies assemble following successive mergers of smaller\ngalaxies. Thus, inferences of the growth of stellar mass using the ages of\nstars within a descendant massive galaxy will be biased. In this paper, I use\nthe TNG100 simulation to quantify this bias across a range of descendant galaxy\nmasses and redshifts, for inferences made for different past epochs. I\ndemonstrate that the assumption of in-situ stellar mass assembly can lead to\nsignificant biases in inferred stellar mass histories, with historic (i.e.\nlooking back from the epoch of observation) stellar masses overestimated by\nover an order of magnitude in some cases. The bias increases with increasing\nhalo mass, for inferences made further from the epoch of observation, and with\ndecreasing descendant galaxy redshift. I derive corrections that can be applied\nto inferred stellar mass histories for more robust comparisons with dark matter\nhalo mass functions at high redshift.",

In anti-de Sitter (AdS) and de Sitter\n(dS) space, the key observables, boundary correlators in AdS and late-time\ncorrelators in dS, are obtained via Witten diagram calculations. While formally\nanalogous to flat-space Feynman diagrams, even tree-level Witten diagrams are\nsignificantly more complicated due to the structure of bulk propagators.\nExisting computational approaches often focus on scalars with a specific\n\"conformal\" mass, for which propagators simplify enough to permit the use of\nstandard flat-space techniques. This restriction, however, omits the generic\ninternal-line masses that arise in many cosmological and holographic settings.\nWe present the Witten-Feynman (WF) parameterization, a general representation\nof scalar Witten diagrams in (A)dS as generalized Euler integrals. The WF\nframework applies in both position and momentum space, accommodates arbitrary\ninternal and external masses, and holds at any loop order. It directly\ngeneralizes the familiar Feynman parameterization form of Feynman integrals,\nmaking it possible to import a broad range of amplitude techniques into the\ncurved-space setting. We illustrate the method through two applications: a\ngeneralization of Weinberg's theorem on ultraviolet convergence and a series\nexpansion technique that can yield explicit evaluations.

We present semi-analytic and numerical solutions describing\nthe time-dependent evolution of CR pressure in the CGM under simplified\nassumptions, which allow for quick evaluation of the vast allowable CR\ntransport parameter space. We demonstrate that time-dependent injection from\nbursty star formation and/or episodic black hole accretion can substantially\nalter CR pressure profiles, particularly in the outer halos of massive galaxies\n($\\gtrsim R_{vir}$). Our work further suggests that CR feedback may play a\nsignificant role in shaping the matter distribution around massive galaxies\n($\\gtrsim M_{\\textrm{halo}} \\sim 10^{13} M_\\odot$), and we speculate that these\ntime-dependent effects may connect to observed phenomena like ``Odd Radio\nCircles\".

    "abstract": "Primordial non-Gaussianities (PNGs) are features in the initial density field\nthat provide a window into the nonlinear dynamics of particles during the\ninflationary epoch. Among them, a distinctive set of signatures from\n\"cosmological collider physics\" originates through interactions of the inflaton\nwith heavy particles active at high energies. The amplitude and form of these\nsignatures depend on the strength and nature of the interactions. The\ncorresponding features in large-scale structure have been studied predominantly\nthrough the use of perturbation theory, restricted to the linear regime of the\ndensity field. In this work, we implement a method for running cosmological\nsimulations with arbitrary bispectra signals in their initial density field,\nand produce a simulation suite of over thirty PNG-generating templates,\nresolving the corresponding collider signatures in the strongly nonlinear\nregime of the density field. We detail the signals in a variety of late-time\nmeasurements -- the matter power spectra, matter bispectra, the halo abundance,\nand halo bias. We then forecast the potential constraints on the signal\namplitudes using weak lensing measurements from the Year-10 dataset of the Vera\nC. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The second and\nthird moments of the lensing convergence field produce constraints that are\ncompetitive and complementary to those from the Cosmic Microwave Background.\nThe data products are publicly released as part of the Ulagam simulation suite.\nOur initial conditions generator is also publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/DhayaaAnbajagane/Aarambam.",

To our knowledge, although predicted theoretically,\nthis is the first time that OPR significantly $> 3$ has been measured in\ninterstellar gas. We find that OPR tends to increase with decreasing H2 column\ndensity, consistent with the expected effects of self-shielding in advancing\nphotodissociation fronts. The population diagrams are consistent with H nucleon\ndensities of $\\sim 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, and an interstellar radiation field scaling\nfactor, G0, of $\\sim 10^3$.

We\nconsider the stellar age catalog of arXiv:2402.00561, selecting 3,000 of the\noldest and most robustly measured main sequence turn-off (MSTO) and subgiant\nbranch (SGB) stars, with ages $>12.5$ Gyr and associated error $<1$ Gyr.

With\na conservative cut in the Kiel diagram, strict quality cuts both on stellar\nparameters and posterior shapes, and removing potential contaminants, we\nisolate a final sample of 160 bona-fide stars, representing the largest sample\nof precise and reliable MSTO and SGB stars ages available to date. The age\ndistribution of the final sample peaks at $13.6 \\pm 1.0$ (stat) $\\pm 1.3$\n(syst) Gyr. Assuming a maximum formation redshift for these stars of $z_f = 20$\n(a formation delay of $\\sim$0.2 Gyr), we obtain a lower bound on $t_U$ of $t_U\n\\geq 13.8 \\pm 1.0$ (stat) $\\pm 1.3$ (syst) Gyr. Considering the $10^{th}$\npercentile of each star's posterior distributions, we find that, at 90% CL\n(stat), 70 stars favour $t_U > 13$ Gyr, while none exceeds 14.1 Gyr. An oldest\nage younger than 13 Gyr for this sample is incompatible with the data, even\nconsidering the full systematic error budget.

In particular, Hubble residuals display a\nluminosity shift based on host mass, known as the mass step, which is often\nused as an extra correction in the standardisation of SN Ia luminosities. Here\nwe investigate Hubble residuals and the mass step in the context of Si II\n$\\lambda 6355$ velocities, using 277 near-peak SNe Ia from ZTF DR2. We divide\nthe sample into high-velocity (HV) and normal-velocity (NV) SNe Ia, separated\nat 12,000 km/s, resulting in 70 HV and 207 NV objects. We then examine links\nbetween Si II $\\lambda$6355 velocities, light-curve stretch $x_{1}$, colour\n$c$, and host properties to explore potential environmental and/or\nprogenitor-related effects. Although we only find a marginal difference between\nthe Hubble residuals of HV and NV SNe Ia, the NV mass step is $0.149 \\pm 0.024$\nmag ($6.3\\sigma$), while HV SNe Ia show $0.046 \\pm 0.041$ mag ($1.1\\sigma$),\nconsistent with zero. The NV-HV mass-step difference is $\\sim 2.2\\sigma$. The\nclearest subtype difference is seen in central regions ($d_{DLR} < 1$), where\nNV SNe Ia show a strong mass step but HV SNe Ia none, yielding a\n$3.1-3.6\\sigma$ difference. A host-colour step appears for both: NV $0.142 \\pm\n0.024$ mag ($5.9\\sigma$) and HV $0.158 \\pm 0.042$ mag ($3.8\\sigma$). Overall,\nNV and HV colour steps are consistent. HV SNe Ia show modest ($\\sim\n2.5$-$3\\sigma$) steps in outer regions ($d_{DLR} > 1$), while NV SNe show\nstronger environmental trends. Thus, NV SNe Ia appear more environmentally\nsensitive, especially in central, likely metal-rich and older regions, while HV\nSNe Ia show weaker, subset-dependent trends, and applying a universal mass-step\ncorrection could introduce biases.

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in quantum computing in recent years, executing\nquantum circuits for practical problems remains challenging due to error-prone\nquantum hardware. Hence, quantum error correction becomes essential but induces\nsignificant overheads in qubits and execution time, often by orders of\nmagnitude. Obviously, these overheads must be reduced. Since many quantum\napplications can tolerate some noise, end users can provide a maximum tolerated\nerror, the error budget, to be considered during compilation and execution.\nThis error budget, or, more precisely, its distribution, can be a key factor in\nachieving the overhead reduction. Conceptually, an error-corrected quantum\ncircuit can be divided into different parts that each have a specific purpose.\nErrors can happen in any of these parts and their errors sum up to the\nmentioned error budget, but how to distribute it among them actually\nconstitutes a degree of freedom. This work is based on the idea that some of\nthe circuit parts can compensate for errors more efficiently than others.\nConsequently, these parts should contribute more to satisfy the total error\nbudget than the parts where it is more costly. However, this poses the\nchallenge of finding optimal distributions. We address this challenge not only\nby providing general guidelines on distributing the error budget, but also a\nmethod that automatically determines resource-efficient distributions for\narbitrary circuits by training a machine learning model on an accumulated\ndataset. The approach is evaluated by analyzing the machine learning model's\npredictions on so far unseen data, reducing the estimated space-time costs for\nmore than 75% of the considered quantum circuits, with an average reduction of\n15.6%, including cases without improvement, and a maximum reduction of 77.7%.",

Using MIST stellar evolution tracks, we show that\nlow-velocity (< 20 km/s) AGB winds, each released over 10^4 yr, are\ngravitationally retained in >10^5 MSun clusters. In addition, AGB winds in such\nclusters collide with each other and the previously retained winds, triggering\na rapid `switch' to efficient gas retention. Expected gas retention fractions,\nmapped across cluster initial mass and size, agree well with the observed\nsecond population fractions in Milky Way GCs. We then show that the accumulated\ngas cannot form new stars because protostellar cores are disrupted by\nencounters with pre-existing stars over 1 - 10 kyr. Instead, the gas is\naccreted onto pre-existing main-sequence stars and compact objects. Bondi-Hoyle\naccretion and time-dependent core-halo models indicate that both white dwarfs\nand neutron stars can grow and collapse within a few 100 Myr, and that\nlower-mass main-sequence stars can be `rejuvenated' into the 4 - 6 MSun range\nrequired to reproduce key abundance patterns. Therefore, in our model, the\nmultiple populations will be found in sufficiently massive clusters, with the\nsecond-population stars being formed from the inner subset of first-population\nstars that accreted large fractions of their mass from the AGB-processed\nretained gas. Finally, we argue that a combination of feedback processes will\nclear the gas by 10^9 yr, thus reproducing the gas-poor conditions observed for\npresent-day clusters.",

However, random fluctuations of the magnetic field\nstochastically perturbs the interferometer paths and induce dephasing.

Constraining the dephasing rate\n$\\Gamma$ to be low enough that the final coherence $e^{-\\Gamma \\tau}\\leq 0.1$\n(where $\\tau$ is the experimental time duration), we obtain the following\nbounds on the noise to signal ratios: $\\delta\n\\eta_\\text{IHP}/\\eta_\\text{IHP}\\lesssim 10^{-13}$, where $\\eta_\\text{IHP}$ is\nthe magnetic field curvature that gives rise to the inverted harmonic\npotential, and $\\delta \\eta_\\text{HP}/\\eta_\\text{HP}\\lesssim 10^{-6}$, where\n$\\eta_\\text{HP}$ is the linear magnetic field gradient that gives rise to the\nharmonic potential.

In gravitational imaging, strong gravitational lens observations are\nused to detect individual objects from this population, if they are large\nenough to perturb the strongly lensed images. We show here that low-mass\nhaloes, below the individually detectable mass limit, have a detectable effect\non the lensed images when in large numbers, which is the case in cold dark\nmatter (CDM). We find that, in CDM, this population causes an excess of 40 per\ncent in the number of detected subhaloes for HST-like strong lens observations.\nWe propose a pseudo-mass function to describe this population, and fit for its\nparameters from the detection data. We find that it mostly consists of objects\ntwo orders of magnitude in mass below the detection limit of individual\nobjects. We show that including this modification, so that the effect of the\npopulation is correctly predicted, can dramatically improve the available\nconstraints on dark matter from strong lens observations.

    "abstract": "One of the most surprising results of early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)\nobservations is the discovery of an abundance of red, compact, broad-line\nobjects dubbed \"little red dots\" (LRDs) at $z>4$. Their spatial density\n($\\sim10^{-4}$-$10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$) is 100 times more abundant than\nUV-selected quasars at those redshift if one extrapolates the quasar luminosity\nfunction (QLF) down to the LRD regime. However, whether LRDs dominate black\nhole accretion at quasar-like luminosities ($L_\\mathrm{bol}\\gtrsim\n10^{45-46}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$) remains unanswered, as probing the bright\nend of the LRD luminosity function requires a much larger area than those able\nto be surveyed by JWST. In this work, we present our search for the brightest\nLRDs ($K<23.7$) at $4.5<z<4.9$ using wide-area multiwavelength imaging surveys\nfrom the near-UV to the infrared bands. With over 15 square degrees of sky\ncoverage, we only identify one single LRD candidate at\n$z_\\mathrm{phot}\\approx4.6$, which translates into a spatial density of\n$n(M_{5100}<-23.5)\\approx10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ -- this is nearly 10\ntimes less abundant than the UV-selected quasars at similar optical luminosity.\nWhen combined with the LRD sample identified by JWST at the same redshift\nrange, we find a sharp cutoff in the optical luminosity function at $\\lambda\nL_{5100}\\approx2.5\\times10^{44}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$, while the QLF turnover\noccurs at $\\gtrsim20$ times higher luminosity. We therefore confirm the\nexclusively low-luminosity nature of LRDs, ruling out that LRDs are the counter\nparts of quasars. Furthermore, we speculate that, if the shape of the\nluminosity function holds up, it points to LRDs being powered by low-mass black\nholes with a narrow range of Eddington-level accretion rates.",

In this work, we\nundertake a comprehensive classification of all fully symmetric QSLs on the\ntrellis lattice using the projective symmetry group approach within the\nAbrikosov fermion representation.

We\ndemonstrate that such dispersions can occur only at high-symmetry points in the\nBrillouin zone with $C_{2v}$ little groups and analyze their characteristic\ncorrelation signatures. Moreover, by optimizing over all mean-field states, we\nmap out a phase diagram -- featuring six distinct phases -- of the\nnearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the trellis lattice. Going beyond\nmean field, we also assess equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors of\nthese phases using density-matrix renormalization group and Keldysh\npseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations.

We investigate the dynamical consequences of such an environment\nusing: (i) a Fokker-Planck analysis of long-term core evolution, (ii) an\nanalytical model for the collisional growth of a very massive star (VMS), and\n(iii) direct $N$-body simulations. All approaches show that runaway collisions\nproduce a VMS with mass $9\\times10^3 < M_{\\rm VMS} \\, [\\rm M_\\odot] <\n5\\times10^4$ within $<1$ Myr. Once the supply of massive stars is depleted, the\nVMS contracts on a $\\sim 8000$ yr Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale and undergoes a\ngeneral relativistic collapse, leaving a massive black hole of mass $M_\\bullet\n\\sim 10^4 \\, \\rm M_\\odot$. We conclude that LRDs are natural nurseries for the\nformation of heavy black hole seeds via stellar-dynamical processes. This\npathway produces seed number densities that far exceed those expected from\ndirect collapse models, and, owing to the dense residual stellar core, can\nsustain high rates of tidal disruption events.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing has made significant advancements in the last years in both\nhardware and software. Unfortunately, the currently available Noisy\nIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware is still heavily affected by noise.\nMany optimization techniques have been developed to reduce the negative effects\nthereof, which, however, only works up to a certain point. Therefore, scaling\nquantum applications from currently considered small research examples to\nindustrial applications requires error-correction techniques to execute quantum\ncircuits in a fault-tolerant fashion and enter the Fault-Tolerant Quantum\nComputing (FTQC) era. These error-correction techniques introduce dramatic\nqubit overheads, leading to the requirement of tens of thousands of qubits\nalready for toy-sized examples. Hence, quantum circuit optimization that\nreduces qubit overheads when shifting from the NISQ to the FTQC era is\nessential. This raises the question, whether we need to start from scratch, or\nwhether current state-of-the-art optimization techniques can be used as a basis\nfor this. To approach this question, this work investigates the effects of\ndifferent optimization passes on a representative selection of quantum\ncircuits. Since hardly any tools to automatically design and evaluate FTQC\nquantum circuits exist yet, we utilize resource estimation to compare the\n(potential) benefits gained by applying NISQ quantum circuit optimization to\nestimated FTQC resource requirements. The results indicate that, indeed, the\nestimated resource requirements for FTQC can be improved by applying NISQ\nquantum circuit optimization techniques. At the same time, more detailed\ninvestigations show what techniques lead to more benefits for FTQC compared to\nothers, providing guidelines for the transfer of NISQ optimization techniques\nto the FTQC era.",

While advanced RHD simulations are required to\nestablish the importance of this effect, adopting an optimistic guess, we find\nthat the SFE increases with cloud surface density, rising from\n$\\epsilon_*=0.023$ at $\\Sigma_g = 37\\ M_\\odot\\ \\mathrm{pc^{-2}}$ to\n$\\epsilon_*=0.27$ at $\\Sigma_g = 1.7 \\times 10^5\\ M_\\odot\\ \\mathrm{pc^{-2}}$.\nGiven the optimistic assumptions adopted, these numbers should be regarded as\nupper limits. We conclude that Ly$\\alpha$ radiation pressure strongly limits\nthe SFE, even at solar metallicities, erasing the possibility that a\nfeedback-free star formation mode with $\\epsilon_* \\gtrsim 0.4$ exists in the\npre-SN phase. This conclusion remains valid even when other effects such as\ndust destruction of Ly$\\alpha$ photons, presence of HII regions, velocity\ngradients, atomic recoil, and turbulence are considered.",

This framework is used for designing optimized\nreinforcements for masonry structures aimed at improving the structural\ncapacity, but without substantial changes in the typical behavior of masonry\nstructural systems, since the reinforcement layout leaves the possibility of\ncracks opening. Therefore, both rocking motions and adaptation to support\nsettlements remain allowed, and the transmission of too high forces to the\nunreinforced structural elements supporting the reinforced one is prevented.\nThis way, a new strengthening strategy, called \"weak reinforcement\" approach is\nobtained. This strategy pursues the challenging goal of combining structural\nsafety and conservation for architectural heritage: indeed, not only the\nhistorical masonry is preserved as much as possible, but also the original\nspecial \"masonry-like\" behavior. The design, in principle, of optimized\nstrengthening intervention through the weak reinforcement approach is\nexemplified through the application to a trilithon under seismic loads and to\nan arch under a concentrated load. The capacity of the structure to adapt to\nsupport settlements is investigated through a suitable procedure for minimizing\nthe total potential energy of the system.",

This difference has become increasingly relevant due\nto the rise of longer queries, with BRIGHT's lengthy reasoning-intensive\nqueries being a prime example, and further accentuated by the increasing usage\nof retrieval-augmented generation, where LLM prompts can grow to be much longer\nthan ''traditional'' search engine queries.

Contrary to the model-agnostic Bayesian analyses our\nscheme allows for distinguishing between the scenarios of neutron stars with\nquark cores and without them. The used quark model realizes asymptotic\nconformality at high densities in accordance with perturbative QCD. The\nhadronic sector is described by the density-dependent relativistic functional\nDD2Y-T, which satisfies chiral effective field theory constraints and includes\nhyperonic degrees of freedom. We construct a large set of candidate hybrid EOSs\nby varying the vector and diquark couplings and apply a Maxwell construction\nfor the quark-hadron phase transition.

    "abstract": "Identifying the microscopic processes that limit conductivity is essential\nfor understanding correlated and quantum-critical states in quantum materials.\nIn twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and other twist-controlled materials, the\ntemperature dependence of metallic resistivity follows power-law scaling, with\nthe exponent spanning a broad range, rendering standard transport measurements\ninsufficient to unambiguously identify the dominant scattering processes and\ngiving rise to competing interpretations ranging from phonon-limited transport\nand umklapp scattering to strange metallicity and heavy fermion\nrenormalization. Here, we use terahertz (THz) excitation to selectively raise\nthe electron temperature in TBG while keeping the lattice cold, enabling a\ndirect separation of electron-electron and electron-phonon contributions to\nresistivity. We observe a giant THz photoresistance, reaching up to 70% in\nmagic-angle devices, demonstrating that electronic interactions dominate\ntransport even in regimes previously attributed to phonons, including the\nlinear-in-temperature resistivity near the magic angle. Away from the magic\nangle, we observe coexisting photoresistance and robust\nquadratic-in-temperature resistivity at extremely low carrier densities where\nstandard electron-electron scattering mechanisms (umklapp and Baber inter-band\nscattering) are kinematically forbidden. Our analysis identifies the breakdown\nof Galilean invariance in the Dirac-type dispersion as a possible origin of the\ninteraction-limited conductivity, arising from inter-valley electron-electron\ncollisions. Beyond twisted bilayer graphene, our approach establishes\nTHz-driven hot-electron transport as a general framework for disentangling\nscattering mechanisms in low-density quantum materials.",

    "abstract": "Neural network quantum states (NQS) excel at approximating ground states of\nquantum many-body systems, but approximating all states of a degenerate\nmanifold is nevertheless computationally expensive. We propose a single-trunk\nmulti-head (ST-MH) NQS ensemble that share a feature extracting trunk while\nattaching lightweight heads for each target state. Using a cost function which\nalso has an orthogonality term, we derive exact analytic gradients and overlap\nderivatives needed to train ST-MH within standard variational Monte Carlo (VMC)\nworkflows. We prove that ST-MH can represent every degenerate eigenstate\nexactly whenever the feature map of latent width $h$, augmented with a\nconstant, has column space containing the linear span of the targets'\nlog-moduli and (chosen) phase branches together with the constant on the common\nsupport where all states are non-vanishing. Under this condition, ST-MH reduces\nthe parameter count and can reduce the leading VMC cost by a factor equal to\nthe degeneracy $K$ relative to other algorithms when $K$ is modest and in trunk\ndominated regimes. As a numerical proof-of-principle, we validate and benchmark\nthe ST-MH approach on the frustrated spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg\nmodel at the Majumdar-Ghosh point on periodic ring lattices of up to 8 sites.\nBy obtaining the momentum eigenstates, we demonstrate that ST-MH attains high\nfidelity and energy accuracy across degenerate ground state manifolds while\nusing significantly lower computing resources. Lastly we provide a qualitative\ncomputational cost analysis which incentivise the applicability of the ST-MH\nensemble under certain criteria on the latent width.",

Building on this\nfoundation, network digital twins (NDTs) accurately depict the operational\nprocesses and attributes of network infrastructures, facilitating predictive\nmanagement through real-time analysis and measurement. However, constructing\nprecise NDTs poses challenges, such as integrating diverse data sources,\nmapping necessary attributes from physical networks, and maintaining\nscalability for various downstream tasks. Unlike previous works that focused on\nthe creation and mapping of NDTs from scratch, we explore intra- and\ninter-operations among NDTs within a Unified Twin Transformation (UTT)\nframework, which uncovers a new computing paradigm for efficient transfer,\nmerging, and splitting of NDTs to create task-oriented twins. By leveraging\njoint multi-modal and distributed mapping mechanisms, UTT optimizes resource\nutilization and reduces the cost of creating NDTs, while ensuring twin model\nconsistency. A theoretical analysis of the distributed mapping problem is\nconducted to establish convergence bounds for this multi-modal gated\naggregation process.

As this data is predominantly\nsourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards\nhigh-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently,\nLLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap\nthat is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures.\nThis issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented\ntopics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first\nshared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these\nspecific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring\nmultiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General\nArabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range\nof topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and\nlanguage expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew\nconsiderable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for\nSubtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our\nfindings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance\nover baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15%\non cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge.

    "abstract": "Smart farming systems encounter significant challenges, including limited\nresources, the need for data privacy, and poor connectivity in rural areas. To\naddress these issues, we present eEnergy-Split, an energy-efficient framework\nthat utilizes split learning (SL) to enable collaborative model training\nwithout direct data sharing or heavy computation on edge devices. By\ndistributing the model between edge devices and a central server, eEnergy-Split\nreduces on-device energy usage by up to 86 percent compared to federated\nlearning (FL) while safeguarding data privacy. Moreover, SL improves\nclassification accuracy by up to 6.2 percent over FL on ResNet-18 and by more\nmodest amounts on GoogleNet and MobileNetV2. We propose an optimal edge\ndeployment algorithm and a UAV trajectory planning strategy that solves the\nTraveling Salesman Problem (TSP) exactly to minimize flight cost and extend and\nmaximize communication rounds. Comprehensive evaluations on agricultural pest\ndatasets reveal that eEnergy-Split lowers UAV energy consumption compared to\nbaseline methods and boosts overall accuracy by up to 17 percent. Notably, the\nenergy efficiency of SL is shown to be model-dependent-yielding substantial\nsavings in lightweight models like MobileNet, while communication and memory\noverheads may reduce efficiency gains in deeper networks.

    "abstract": "Hydrodynamic interactions (HI) between segments of a polymer have long been\nknown to strongly affect polymer stretching in laminar viscometric flows. Yet\nthe role of HI in fluctuating turbulent flows remains unclear. Using Brownian\ndynamics simulations, we examine the stretching dynamics of bead-spring chains\nwith inter-bead HI, as they are transported in a homogeneous isotropic\nturbulent flow (within the ultra-dilute, one-way coupling regime). We find that\nHI-endowed chains exhibit a steeper coil-stretch transition as the elastic\nrelaxation time is increased, i.e., HI cause less stretching of stiff polymers\nand more stretching of moderately to highly elastic polymers. The probability\ndistribution function of the end-to-end extension is also modified, with HI\nsignificantly limiting the range of extensions over which a power-law range\nappears. On quantifying the repeated stretching and recoiling of chains by\ncomputing persistence time distributions, we find that HI delays migration\nbetween stretched and coiled states. These effects of HI, which are consistent\nwith chains experiencing an effective conformation-dependent drag, are\nsensitive to the level of coarse-graining in the bead-spring model.\nSpecifically, an HI-endowed dumbbell, which cannot form a physical coil, is\nunable to experience the hydrodynamic shielding effect of HI. Our results\nhighlight the importance of incorporating an extension-dependent drag force in\ndumbbell-based simulations of turbulent polymer solutions. To develop and test\nsuch an augmented dumbbell model, we propose the use of a time-correlated\nGaussian random flow, in which the turbulent stretching statistics are shown to\nbe well-approximated.",

    "abstract": "The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)\npresents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in\nnative agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,\naction, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data\nscalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of\nGUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we\npresent UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these\nchallenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for\nscalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI\nenvironment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox\nplatform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that\nUI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.\nOn GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on\nWindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines\nsuch as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean\nnormalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level\nperformance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,\nOpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to\nlong-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,\nhighlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of\ntraining dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and\nefficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's\npotential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization\nto real-world interactive scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing\nand treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image\nsegmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which\nis inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In\nthis situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI\nmodalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,\nsuffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data\nheterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI\nimage segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves\nmultiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It\ndistinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and\ncross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel\nmodality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework\n(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality\ndecoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the\nmodality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored\nand modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,\ncorresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,\nrespectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of\nheterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the\nmodality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes\ndynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for\nincomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality\naggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive\nexperiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of our methods.",

Firstly, high-velocity satellites, aerial relays and\nsea-surface platforms suffer from obsolete channel state information (CSI),\nundermining feedback-based adaptation. Secondly, data-rate disparity across the\nprotocol stack is extreme: terabit optical links in space coexist with kilobit\nacoustic under-water links. This article shows that a single large language\nmodel (LLM) backbone, trained jointly on radio, optical and acoustic traces,\ncan provide a unified, data-driven adaptation layer that addresses both rapid\nCSI ageing and severe bandwidth disparity across the SAGSIN protocol stack.\nExplicitly, an LLM-based long-range channel predictor forecasts the strongest\ndelay-Doppler components several coherence intervals ahead, facilitating\nnear-capacity reception despite violent channel fluctuations. Furthermore, our\nLLM-based semantic encoder turns raw sensor payloads into task-oriented tokens.\nThis substantially reduces the SNR required for high-fidelity image delivery in\na coastal underwater link, circumventing the data rate limitation by semantic\ncommunications. Inclusion of these tools creates a medium-agnostic adaptation\nlayer that spans radio, optical and acoustic channels.

We first consider exponential coupling functions to establish\nanalytic control and facilitate comparison with previous literature. In this\ncase, we uncover a pair of genuinely non-geodesic fixed points, which act as\nattractors within a submanifold of the full system. In contrast, when the axion\nshift symmetry remains unbroken, our analysis shows that the apparent\nnon-geodesic fixed point reported previously does not persist once the full\ndynamics are taken into account.

On five benchmarks\nin the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL\nbaselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and\nnovelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution\nquality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing\nfor diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as\nhigher-quality responses.",

Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation\nis challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to\nvarious types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as\na simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth\nsignals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,\nwe develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from\nsimulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that\nCDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively\nbridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments\ndemonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,\nwithout the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes\nseamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving\narticulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance\ndegradation.

As a consequence, in the\nspecific case of the inverse semigroup of matrix units, we identify the product\nin the space of maps on the matrix algebras which is preserved by the\nChoi-Jamio{\\l}kowski isomorphism as convolution. Then, by defining the Fourier\ntransform of a map from $\\mathbb{C}_0[S]$ to $M_n(\\mathbb{C})$, we derive the\nFourier inversion formula when $S$ is a finite inverse semigroup. As a\ncorollary of this formula, we show that in the case of the inverse semigroup of\nmatrix units, the Fourier transformation of a map with respect to the identity\nrepresentation becomes the Choi matrix of the map and the Fourier inversion\nformula becomes the Choi inversion formula. Then, by defining the notion of\nmatrix valued positive definite maps, we prove Bochner's theorem in the context\nof finite inverse semigroup. It is demonstrated that Bochner's theorem reduces\nto Choi theorem on completely positive maps when the inverse semigroup of\nmatrix units is considered. Additionally, the necessary and sufficient\ncondition on a representation $\\rho:M_m \\to M_{d_{\\rho}}(\\mathbb{C})$ such that\nthe Complete positivity vs. positivity correspondence holds between a linear\nmap $\\Phi: M_m(\\mathbb{C}) \\to M_n(\\mathbb{C})$ and its Fourier Transform\n$\\widehat{\\Phi}(\\rho)$ is obtained.",

This appeals to the\nstrengths of both the quantum and classical hardware; where state-sampling is\nclassically hard, the quantum computer can provide computational advantage in\nthe selection of high quality configuration subspaces, while the final\nmolecular energies are evaluated by solving an interaction matrix on HPC and is\ntherefore not corrupted by hardware noise. In this work, we present an\nalgorithm that leverages stochastic Hamiltonian time evolution in\nQuantum-Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI), with multireference\nperturbation theory capturing missed correlations outside the configuration\nsubspace. The approach is validated through a hardware demonstration utilising\n42 qubits of an IQM superconducting device to calculate the potential energy\ncurve of the inorganic silane molecule, SiH4 using a 6-31G atomic orbital basis\nset, under a stretching of the Si-H bond length. We assess the resulting\nwavefunctions for compactness, a point on which QSCI has previously been\ncriticised. At large separations, where static correlation dominates, we find a\nconfiguration space more than 200 times smaller than that obtained from a\nconventional SCI selection criterion yields comparable energies. We also\ncompare against the best-in-class Heatbath Configuration Interaction algorithm\nand observe similar wavefunction compactness at convergence. This result is\nachieved with a configuration sampling scheme that uses the experimental\norbital occupancies of a time-evolved quantum state to predict likely single\nand double excitations away from existing configurations to bias the subspace\nexpansion procedure.",

RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards\nto guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output\nquality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR\nparadigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from\nsparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in\nRL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\\textbf{PACS}$, a\nnovel RLVR framework that achieves im$\\textbf{P}$licit $\\textbf{A}$ctor\n$\\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By\ntreating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR\nproblem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by\nthe policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient\nanalysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the\nclassical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic\nroles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging\nmathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as\nPPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS\nachieves 59.78\\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32\nand 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO.

This study conducts a\ncomparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed\nmultilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models\n(LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained\non code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained\non non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google\nGemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER\ntags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using\nPrecision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models,\nparticularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform\nothers - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to\ndomain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show\nlimited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot\nperformance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study\nprovides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized\nmodels for code-mixed NER tasks.",

Mixed Precision Quantization assigns\ndifferent precisions to different layers of an LLM/VLM based on layer\nsensitivity and importance within the model. In this work, we propose a Post\nTraining Quantization algorithm, MoPEQ, that assigns optimal bit width to each\nexpert.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a\nwide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in\nopen-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving\nlogical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including\ntemperature scaling, top-\\$p\\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\\$p\\$ sampling, aim\nto manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in\nthe effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the\ncorresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\\$p\\$ sampling relies on a\nsingle top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the\ninformation of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of\nthe confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We\nfirst establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity\nand coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained\nminimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be\nequivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,\nwhich is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally\nefficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical\nevaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA)\nalternative of min-\\$p\\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing\nbenchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as\nGPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms\nthat top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where\ncreativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in\nopen-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing\napplications.

As part of this study, we introduce the notion of $C_Q$-visible sets,\ndefined with respect to a selected subset $Q$ of vertices in a graph $G$.

HIP18606 is a naked-eye (V=5.8 mags) K0III star and is found to host\na planet with an orbital period of ~675 days, a minimum mass (Msini) of 0.8 MJ,\nand a circular orbit. HIP111909 is a bright (V=7.4 mags) K1III star, and hosts\ntwo giant planets on circular orbits with minimum masses of Msini=1.2 MJ and\nMsini=0.8 MJ, and orbital periods of ~490 d and ~890 d, for planets b and c\nrespectively, strikingly close to the 5:3 orbital period ratio. Analysis of 11\nknown giant star planetary systems arrive at broadly similar parameters to\nthose published, whilst adding a further two new worlds orbiting these stars.\nWith these new discoveries, we have found a total of 13 planetary systems\n(including three multiple systems) within the 37 giant stars that comprise the\nEXPRESS and PPPS common sample. Periodogram analyses of stellar activity\nindicators present possible peaks at frequencies close to proposed Doppler\nsignals in at least two planetary systems, HIP24275 and HIP90988, calling for\nmore long-term activity studies of giant stars. Even disregarding these\npossible false-positives, extrapolation leads to a fraction of 25-30% of\nlow-luminosity giant stars hosting planets. We find the mass-function\nexponentially rises towards the lowest planetary masses, however there exists a\n~93% probability that a second population of giant planets with minimum masses\nbetween 4-5 MJ, is present, worlds that could have formed by the gravitational\ncollapse of fragmenting proto-planetary disks.

    "abstract": "A pioneering rule-based mechanical translation system (precursor of modern\nRBMTs) was first presented in December 1929 by its inventor, Federico Pucci,\nwho later published the full method in a book titled \"Il traduttore meccanico\ned il metodo per corrispondersi fra Europei conoscendo ciascuno solo la propria\nlingua: Parte I\", in Salerno (Italy), in 1931. This study illustrates how AI\nbreathes new life into the system of international keys and ideograms devised\nby Pucci to translate from/into any Romance language (at least as a first\nstep). The methodology involves having the AIs retranslate, following Pucci's\nmethod, the two text excerpts originally translated in 1931 and clearly\ndocumented in his publication: a passage from Dante's La Vita Nuova, translated\nfrom Italian into French, and a passage from Voltaire's Zadig, translated from\nFrench into Italian. The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years\napart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low\naverage difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci's system\nthus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in\nEnglish, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were\nconsistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating\nmore modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an\ninvention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond\nits creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible\nexperimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical\nstatus but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to\nmachine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as\nTroyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history\nof the field is understood.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public\nconcerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build\ntrustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect\nstylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits\nthe detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic\nExperts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty\nquantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three\ncore components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the\nStylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE).\nFor input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and\nprovide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic\nstatistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the\noptimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels\nwith the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average\nimprovement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More\ninspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource\ncase.

    "abstract": "The stability rule for belief, advocated by Leitgeb [Annals of Pure and\nApplied Logic 164, 2013], is a rule for rational acceptance that captures\ncategorical belief in terms of $\\textit{probabilistically stable\npropositions}$: propositions to which the agent assigns resiliently high\ncredence. The stability rule generates a class of $\\textit{probabilistically\nstable belief revision}$ operators, which capture the dynamics of belief that\nresult from an agent updating their credences through Bayesian conditioning\nwhile complying with the stability rule for their all-or-nothing beliefs. In\nthis paper, we prove a representation theorem that yields a complete\ncharacterisation of such probabilistically stable revision operators and\nprovides a `qualitative' selection function semantics for the (non-monotonic)\nlogic of probabilistically stable belief revision. Drawing on the theory of\ncomparative probability orders, this result gives necessary and sufficient\nconditions for a selection function to be representable as a\nstrongest-stable-set operator on a finite probability space. The resulting\nlogic of probabilistically stable belief revision exhibits strong monotonicity\nproperties while failing the AGM belief revision postulates and satisfying only\nvery weak forms of case reasoning. In showing the main theorem, we prove two\nresults of independent interest to the theory of comparative probability: the\nfirst provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the joint representation\nof a pair of (respectively, strict and non-strict) comparative probability\norders. The second result provides a method for axiomatising the logic of ratio\ncomparisons of the form ``event $A$ is at least $k$ times more likely than\nevent $B$''. In addition to these measurement-theoretic applications, we point\nout two applications of our main result to the theory of simple voting games\nand to revealed preference theory.",

In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as\norgans, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often\nanisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In\nthis study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),\narguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific\nchallenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have\nproven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean\ndistances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional\nEncodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,\nbut they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),\na generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and\ndomain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against\ncommonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ\nclassification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in\nechocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can\nsignificantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on\nthe shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,\nour proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested\nanisotropic settings.

    "abstract": "Medium-range order (MRO) is a key structural feature of amorphous materials,\nbut its origin and nature remain elusive. Here, we reveal the MRO in amorphous\narsenic (a-As) using advanced atomistic simulations, based on machine-learned\npotentials derived using automated workflows. Our simulations accurately\nreproduce the experimental structure factor of a-As, especially the first sharp\ndiffraction peak (FSDP), which is a signature of MRO. We compare and contrast\nthe structure of a-As with that of its lighter homologue, red amorphous\nphosphorus (a-P), identifying the dihedral-angle distribution as a key factor\ndifferentiating the MRO in both. The pressure-dependent structural behaviors of\na-As and a-P differ as well, which we link to the interplay of ring topology\nand structural entropy. We finally show that the origin of the FSDP is closely\ncorrelated with the size and spatial distribution of voids in the amorphous\nnetworks. Our work provides fundamental insights into MRO in an amorphous\nelemental system, and more widely it illustrates the usefulness of automation\nfor machine-learning-driven atomistic simulations.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of navigating unmanned aerial vehicles in\ncontested environments by introducing a cooperative multi-agent framework that\nincreases the likelihood of safe UAV traversal. The approach involves two types\nof UAVs: low-priority agents that explore and localize threats, and a\nhigh-priority agent that navigates safely to its target destination while\nminimizing the risk of detection by enemy radar systems. The low-priority\nagents employ a decentralized optimization algorithm to balance exploration,\nradar localization, and safe path identification for the high-priority agent.\nFor the high-priority agent, two path-planning methods are proposed: one for\ndeterministic scenarios using weighted Voronoi diagrams, and another for\nuncertain scenarios that leverages generalized Voronoi diagrams (incorporating\na non-Euclidean criterion derived from uncertainty in the radar's probability\nof detection) alongside probabilistic constraints. Both methods employ\noptimization techniques to refine the trajectories while accounting for\nkinematic constraints and radar detection probabilities. Numerical simulations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Traditional data-driven approaches, such as\nconvolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological\ninformation about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate\ninformation exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning\nhydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction\nmodels collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training\nexplodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing\nmethods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying\nGNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,\nthus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for\naccurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every\nland and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow\ndirections and inter-catchment relationships.

However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios\nusing Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and\nperformance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by\na distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation\nof low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing\ncatastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that\nstabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter\nout trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code\nblock nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the\npolicy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude\ngradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show\nthat SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math\nreasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only\nbaseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.\nFurthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR\nencourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns,\nsuch as self-correction and cross-validation.",

This\nis commonly formulated as an inverse problem with a linear forward model.\nHowever, reconstructing high-quality images using the forward model alone is\nchallenging, necessitating the use of regularization techniques. Over the\nyears, numerous methods have been developed, including wavelets, total\nvariation, low-rank models, and deep neural networks. In this work, we\ninvestigate the paradigm of denoiser-driven regularization, where a powerful\noff-the-shelf denoiser is used for implicit regularization within an iterative\nalgorithm. This approach has shown promise but remains relatively underexplored\nin hyperspectral imaging. Our focus is on a crucial aspect of denoiser-driven\nalgorithms: ensuring convergence of the iterations. It is known that powerful\ndenoisers can produce high-quality reconstructions, but they are also prone to\ninstability and can cause the iterations to diverge. The challenge is to design\ndenoisers that come with a convergence guarantee. In this work, we propose a\ndenoiser-driven fusion algorithm, HyDeFuse, which leverages a class of\npseudo-linear denoisers for implicit regularization. We demonstrate how the\ncontraction mapping theorem can be applied to establish global linear\nconvergence of HyDeFuse.

    "abstract": "Shape-morphing structures have been intensively researched for a wide range\nof engineering applications, including multi-modal soft robots and\nproperty-programmable metamaterials, owing to their ability to change shape and\nsize in response to external stimuli. Ring origami, consisting of closed-loop\nrods, is a class of shape-morphing structures that undergo shape transformation\nthrough folding enabled by snap-buckling instabilities. Previous studies have\nshown that 2D ring origami composed of rod segments with in-plane natural\ncurvature (i.e., the stress-free curved state lies in the plane of the planar\nring) can achieve diverse and intriguing 2D-to-2D shape transformations. Here,\nwe propose a 2D-to-3D shape transformation strategy for ring origami by\nintroducing out-of-plane natural curvature (i.e., the stress-free curved state\nlies in a plane perpendicular to the planar ring) into the rod segments. Due to\nnatural curvature-induced out-of-plane bending moments, a 2D elastic ring\nspontaneously snaps out-of-plane and reaches equilibrium in a 3D configuration.\nThese snapping-induced out-of-plane shape transitions not only enable\nself-guided, spontaneous shape morphing, but also allow the construction of\ncomplex structures from simple geometries, making them promising for the design\nof functional deployable and foldable structures. By combining a multi-segment\nKirchhoff rod model with finite element simulations and experiments, we\nsystematically investigate the 3D equilibrium states and transition behavior of\nthese systems. We demonstrate that by rationally designing the out-of-plane\nnatural curvature of rod segments, the rings can exhibit a range of functional\nbehaviors, including spontaneous 2D-to-3D shape transformation (e.g., planar\nsquare to sphere) via snap-folding, multistable 3D configuration transitions,\nand compact monostable zero-energy 3D configurations.",

A novel contribution is made by\nincluding a Galerkin projection onto a basis of divergence-free modes that\nsatisfy the no-slip boundary conditions. This projection not only makes the\nvariational framework applicable to wall-bounded flows but it also yields a\nlow-order representation of the dynamics.

    "abstract": "This paper reconstructs the derivations underlying the kinematical part of\nEinstein's 1905 special relativity paper, emphasizing their operational clarity\nand minimalist use of mathematics. Einstein employed modest tools-algebraic\nmanipulations, Taylor expansions, partial differentials, and functional\narguments-yet his method was guided by principles of linearity, symmetry, and\ninvariance rather than the elaborate frameworks of electron theory. The\npublished text in \"Annalen der Physik\" concealed much of the algebraic\nscaffolding, presenting instead a streamlined sequence of essential equations.\nFar from reflecting a lack of sophistication, this economy of means was a\ndeliberate rhetorical and philosophical choice: to demonstrate that relativity\narises from two simple postulates and basic operational definitions, not from\nthe complexities of electron theory. The reconstruction highlights how\nEinstein's strategy subordinated mathematics to principle, advancing a new mode\nof reasoning in which physical insight, rather than computational elaboration,\nheld decisive authority. In this respect, I show that Einstein's presentation\ndiverges sharply from Poincar\\'e's.",

Our aim is to provide insights on SF divertor\ndesign for future devices. In this work, the impacts of magnetic geometry and\ndivertor target geometry in the four types of SF configurations on plasma\nbehavior and power exhaust performance are investigated in detail.\nLow-recycling regime, high-recycling and detachment in the four types of SF\ndivertors are obtained through an upstream density scan. The secondary X-point\npositions of SF divertors are systematically varied to examine their impact.\nFor Low-Field-Side (LFS) SF- and High-Field-Side (HFS) SF- divertors the\nobserved power splitting, induced by the secondary X-point, is consistent with\nexperimental observations. The effect of target geometry is studied by\ncomparing the flat target plates with the ITER-like divertor shape. The overall\nsimulation results reveal a notable consequence of the LFS SF- divertor: closed\nstructure of the inner target with high inclined plate can compress recycling\nneutrals originating from the HFS divertor region into the LFS SOL and PFR\nregions. This results in considerable volumetric dissipation through strong\nionization and recombination, causing the connected outer target region to\ndetach. This feature can be considered in the design of the LFS SF- divertor\nfor future devices. For the LFS and HFS SF+ divertors, the region between the\ntwo X-points exhibits strong ionization and recombination sources close to the\nprimary X-point. This feature might be beneficial for the formation of an\nX-point radiator, but would require further impurity seeding simulation study.",

To help\nsolve this problem, this paper presents Coral, an abstraction layer for\nbuilding, deploying, and coordinating independent software components that\nmaximizes composability to allow for rapid system integration without modifying\nlow-level code. Rather than replacing existing tools, Coral complements them by\nintroducing a higher-level abstraction that constrains the integration process\nto semantically meaningful choices, reducing the configuration burden without\nlimiting adaptability to diverse domains, systems, and tasks. We describe Coral\nin detail and demonstrate its utility in integrating software for scenarios of\nincreasing complexity, including LiDAR-based SLAM and multi-robot corrosion\nmitigation tasks. By enabling practical composability in robotics software,\nCoral offers a scalable solution to a broad range of robotics system\nintegration challenges, improving component reusability, system\nreconfigurability, and accessibility to both expert and non-expert users.

We then focus on\nthe evolution of various quantities between the Reionization and Cosmic Noon\neras. Our findings are: (1) The extent of Mg II and hence the amount of cool\n($T\\sim 10^4$ K), enriched gas in the average halo decreases continuously with\ncosmic time after $z \\approx 6$--$8$. This effect is more pronounced in\n$W_r^{2796}\\lesssim 0.3$ {\\AA} systems (outermost layers of the model) and, in\ngeneral, affects O I more than Mg II, probably due to the onset of\nphotoionization by the UV background. (2) The line density of\n$W_r^{2796}\\gtrsim 1$ {\\AA} systems (model inner layers) constantly increases\nin synchrony with the star formation rate density until it reaches a peak at\nCosmic Noon. The line density of $W_r^{2796}\\lesssim 0.3$ {\\AA} systems, on the\nother hand, remains constant or decreases over the same period. (3) At the end\nof Reionization, the filling factor is low enough that the winds have not yet\nreached neighboring halos. This implies that the halos are self-enriched, as\nsuggested by semi-analytic models. We discuss how these statistical predictions\ncan be reconciled with early metal enrichment models and offer a practical\ncomparison point for future analyses of quasar absorption lines at $z>6$.",

We investigate an alternative framework featuring the presence of an\nanti-de Sitter vacuum in the dark energy sector, a model that naturally arises\nin quantum gravity models like string theory and can enhance early structure\nformation. Using a self-consistent semi-analytical model that couples galaxy\nevolution with reionization, we confront this scenario with a wide range of\nobservations. We first show that while a model tailored to fit the high-$z$ UV\nluminosity functions (UVLFs) shows promise, it is in strong tension with\nwell-established cosmological constraints from the CMB and other low-redshift\nprobes. Conversely, models within this framework that are consistent with these\nconstraints provide only a modest boost to structure formation and fail to\nreproduce the observed JWST galaxy abundances at $z > 10$. While these models\nremain consistent with the cosmic reionization history, our primary result is\nthat this class of cosmological modifications is insufficient on its own to\nexplain the galaxy excess. Our study underscores the critical importance of\nholistic testing for any beyond-$\\Lambda$CDM proposal; apparent success in one\nobservational regime does not guarantee overall viability.

A key application of this is solving partial\ndifferential equations, where the Laplacian operator and its finite difference\ndiscretization serve as foundational examples. In this paper, we present an\nefficient and explicit block encoding method that enhances existing approaches\nin key aspects. We detail the construction of the quantum algorithm and\nillustrate how it leverages the unique structure of finite difference\ndiscretizations. Furthermore, we analytically derive the scaling of the\nsub-normalization factor and of the success probability of the block encoding\nwith respect to the problem dimension, the grid width of the finite difference\ngrid and the regularity of the exact solution, and we give resource estimates.",

We represent these traces using\nsymbolic regular expressions (SREs), enabling formal specification of incorrect\nabstract data type (ADT) behaviors across function boundaries. The core\ncontribution is a novel type inference algorithm that operates modulo specified\nincorrectness properties and leverages the symbolic finite automata (SFAs)\nrepresentations of regexes for compositional reasoning of traces.

In this\ncontext, this work aims to study the spectrum of DWPT loads under different\ntraffic conditions. We develop statistical models for EVs moving at constant\nspeeds to identify the location and magnitude of DWPT load harmonics. Our\nanalysis reveals that the fundamental frequency is dependent on the ER coil\nspacing and the average EV speed. In the worst-case yet unlikely scenario that\nEVs move in a synchronized fashion, the amplitude of harmonics scales with the\nnumber of EVs. On the contrary, when EVs move freely, harmonics scale with the\nsquare root of the number of EVs. Platoon formations can accentuate harmonics.\nWe also show that for higher-order harmonics, the spectral content around\nharmonics decreases in magnitude and increases in bandwidth. Despite the\nsimplified models, our analysis offers valuable insights for ER planners and\ngrid operators. Numerical tests using a traffic simulator corroborate some of\nthese insights.",

    "abstract": "Line-intensity mapping (LIM) traces the large-scale distribution of matter by\nmeasuring fluctuations in aggregate line emission from unresolved galaxies and\nthe intergalactic medium, providing a powerful probe of both astrophysics and\ncosmology. However, interpreting LIM data is limited by our ability to\ndisentangle the signal of a target spectral line from continuum emission and\ninterloper lines, which are emissions from other redshifts that fall within the\nobserved frequency band. Astrophysical modeling uncertainties further\ncomplicate matters, leaving the relative amplitudes of the map components\npoorly understood. In this paper, we present a neural-network (NN) approach to\nseparate the three map components at the level of the angular power spectrum,\nexplicitly accounting for uncertainties in their relative amplitudes. As test\ncases, we generate SPHEREx-like maps with variable interloper line luminosities\nacross multiple frequency channels, with and without pixel-wise scatter and\ncontinuum contributions. We find that cross-channel correlations are essential\nfor robust NN performance when scatter is present. The NN exhibits a hierarchy\nin residual errors: brighter components yield smaller residuals, and the\ndimmest the highest. Without continuum emission, the network recovers the\ntarget power spectrum to within $2.5\\%$, while partially correcting the\ninterloper spectra. With continuum included, the NN accurately reconstructs the\npower spectra of the continuum and target line, within $2\\%$ and $6\\%$,\nrespectively, but fails to recover those of the interlopers. Reducing\npixel-level scatter further improves performance, lowering residual errors to\n$1\\%$ (continuum) and $3\\%$ (target line).",

    "abstract": "Due to the event driven nature and the versatility of GUI designs in Android\nprograms, it is challenging to generate event sequences with adequate code\ncoverage within a reasonable time. A common approach to handle this issue is to\nrely on GUI models to generate event sequences. These sequences can be\neffective in covering GUI states, but inconsistent in exposing program\nbehaviors that require specific inputs. A major obstacle to generate such\nspecific inputs is the lack of a systematic GUI exploration process to\naccommodate the analysis requirements. In this paper, we introduce Android Path\nExplorer (APEX), a systematic input generation framework using concolic\nexecution. APEX addresses the limitations of model-based sequence generation by\nusing concolic execution to discover the data dependencies of GUI state\ntransitions. Moreover, concolic execution is also used to prioritize events\nduring the exploration of GUI, which leads to a more robust model and accurate\ninput generation. The key novelty of APEX is that concolic execution is not\nonly used to construct event sequences, but also used to traverse the GUI more\nsystematically. As such, our experimental results show that APEX can be used to\ngenerate a set of event sequences that achieve high code coverage, as well as\nevent sequences that reach specific targets.",

One of the main challenges towards the successful\ndeployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions\nof parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been\nproposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated\nwhen producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently\nmanaging the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts\nshould be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.\n  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert\nmanagement optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture\nof LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first\npresent lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and\nrandomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like\npolicies have good theoretical competitive performance.

Disruption recovery decisions are often made\nin a sequential process that includes flight rescheduling, aircraft rerouting,\ncrew reassignment, passenger re-accommodation, and gate reassignment for\nairline operations. Such a sequential recovery approach alleviates the\ncomplexity of the whole recovery process but often causes further disruptions\nto airport gate assignments and high recovery costs for airlines and\npassengers.

The proposed model is tested on\nreal-world data. In our experiments, all test instances are solved by the BCG\nmethod under a five-minute threshold with optimality gaps within 5%.

Based on this model, the\npaper investigates two antenna activation protocols for channel estimation: a\nserial protocol based on one-by-one antenna activation and a parallel protocol\nutilizing a binary S-Matrix activation. The serial protocol is characterized by\nits superior numerical stability but a lack of array gain, whereas the parallel\nprotocol theoretically offers array gain but suffers from severe performance\ndegradation due to structural crosstalk from the non-orthogonal S-Matrix and\nill-conditioning from cumulative leakage. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the\nfundamental commonalities and asymmetries between uplink and downlink channel\nestimation in pinching-antenna systems. Numerical results demonstrate that 1)\nin an ideal lossless model, the parallel protocol is superior to the serial\nprotocol due to the array gain from simultaneous energy collection in uplink\ntransmission; 2) in a practical model with physical losses, the serial protocol\noutperforms the parallel protocol, as the performance of the parallel protocol\nis degraded by the numerical instability from cumulative leakage, which\noutweighs the benefit of array gain; 3) For downlink channel estimation, the\nserial protocol is more suitable because it avoids bidirectional power\nsplitting, while the parallel protocol is more suitable for the uplink as it\ncan make full use of array gain.",

Turns\nout, strangely, this is indeed clearly the case. The problem is not that the\nLLMs just lose context or become incoherent. The problem is that in various\nscenarios, LLMs lose context in very specific ways, which systematically\nresemble runaway optimisers in the following distinct ways: 1) Ignoring\nhomeostatic targets and \"defaulting\" to unbounded maximisation instead. 2) It\nis equally concerning that the \"default\" meant also reverting back to\nsingle-objective optimisation.

In some trials the LLMs were successful until the end.\nThis means, while current LLMs do conceptually grasp biological and economic\nalignment, they exhibit randomly triggered problematic behavioural tendencies\nunder sustained long-running conditions, particularly involving multiple or\ncompeting objectives.

    "abstract": "The isothermal spatio-temporal evolution of an interface between binary\nfluids, with temperature sensitive miscibility gap, subjected to shear flow is\ninvestigated using direct numerical simulations. The thermophysical properties\nand the interfacial tension in such fluids exhibit a dynamic temperature\ndependence based on the degree of miscibility. These fluid pairs can therefore\nbe deployed in crucial microfluidic applications involving enhancement of\nliquid-liquid mass transfer. In this study, a modified phase-field approach\nthat allows modeling of partially miscible fluids and continuous transition\nfrom an initially immiscible state to a completely miscible state is employed\nto investigate the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. The analysis entails two\ndifferent configurations based on the thermodynamic equilibrium of the system.\nIn the first configuration, the fluid pair is considered in equilibrium at\ndifferent degrees of partially miscibility. The second configuration deals with\nfluids out of equilibrium thereby allowing simultaneous mass transport across\nthe interface. The results reveal the effect of apparent surface tension in\nmiscible fluids, shear flow profile, the degree of stratification and the\neffect of mass diffusion across the interface. The shear instability in a fluid\npair close to the consolute point is found to be independent of the extent of\nstratification. Finally, the competition between the time scales of the\ninstability and the diffusion process reveals the importance of the surface\ntension of binary fluids in the immiscible limit.",

Loop heat pipes (LHPs) are one kind of two-phase heat transfer device\nwhich can meet all these requirements. A physics-based one-dimensional\nnumerical model has been elaborated to further develop this promising\nelectronics cooling solution. In addition, an experimental setup using water as\ncoolant, and which includes an LHP built with transparent materials, is used to\nvalidate the numerical model. This validation is obtained by comparing the\nnumerical results with the temperature measurements, the two-phase flow section\nlength in the condenser line, and an energy balance evaluation. The numerical\nmodel is then used to predict the system performance of the LHP under\ninvestigation. The results indicate that this LHP can only work in fixed\nconductance mode for the given operating conditions. Further, the influence of\nthe charging mass is assessed. For low charging masses, both the natural\nconvection cooled condenser and the compensation chamber casing can be fully\nutilized to dissipate the input heat, which can exceed {29.9 W} when the\ncoolant saturation temperature is at {100 \\celsius}. The operational limits for\nLHPs are investigated. For the current LHP under given operating conditions,\nthe heat dissipation limit restricts the maximum input heat power, which in\nturn induces the activation of the heat leakage limit and the liquid-filling\nlimit. It is shown that the condenser with higher heat dissipation capacity and\nlower thermal resistance will therefore enlarge the operational envelope.",

To address this\nconcern, a native integration of sustainability into the operations of\nnext-generation networks through novel designs and metrics is necessary.\nNevertheless, existing wireless sustainability efforts remain limited to\nenergy-efficient network designs which fail to capture the environmental impact\nof such systems. In this paper, a novel sustainability metric is proposed that\ncaptures emissions per bit, providing a rigorous measure of the environmental\nfootprint associated with energy consumption in 6G networks. This metric also\ncaptures how energy, computing, and communication resource parameters influence\nthe reduction of emissions per bit. Then, the problem of allocating the energy,\ncomputing and communication resources is posed as a multi-objective (MO)\noptimization problem. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, our framework\nleverages MO reinforcement learning (MORL) to maximize the novel sustainability\nmetric alongside minimizing energy consumption and average delays in\nsuccessfully delivering the data, all while adhering to constraints on energy\nresource capacity. The proposed MORL methodology computes a global policy that\nachieves a Pareto-optimal tradeoff among multiple objectives, thereby balancing\nenvironmental sustainability with network performance.

Nonetheless, substantial challenges persist in\nsuch systems, encompassing spin entanglement and the possession of only one\nedge state (Chern number C=1), which significantly hinder their practical\napplications. Herein, we propose a novel two-dimensional ferromagnetic\nhalf-semi-Weyl-metal, monolayer Ti2TeSO, that exhibits exceptional electronic\nproperties.

Furthermore, it is demonstrated that\nvalley polarization can be achieved and controlled through the application of\nstrain and the manipulation of the direction of magnetization.

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that active matter exhibits instances of mixed\nsymmetry that cannot be fully described by either polar or nematic formalism.\nHere, we introduce a minimal model that integrates self-propulsion into the\nactive nematic framework. Our linear stability analyses reveal how\nself-propulsion shifts the onset of instability, fundamentally altering the\ndynamical landscape. Numerical simulations confirm these predictions, showing\nthat self-propulsion induces anti-hyperuniform fluctuations, anomalous\nlong-range order in vorticity, and non-universal self-similar energy cascades.\nNotably, these long-range ordered states emerge within the active turbulence\nregime well before the transition to a flocking state. Additionally, our\nanalyses highlight a non-monotonic dependence of self-organization on\nself-propulsion, with optimal states characterized by a peak in correlation\nlength. These findings are relevant for understanding of active nematic systems\nthat self-propel, such as migrating cell layers or swarming bacteria, and offer\nnew avenues for designing synthetic systems with tailored collective\nbehaviours, bridging the gap between active nematics and self-propulsive\nsystems.",

CAPOS focuses on surveying clusters within the Galactic Bulge, using\nthe APOGEE-2S spectrograph, part of the SDSS-IV survey, a component of the\nsecond generation Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment\n(APOGEE-2). For the spectral analysis, we use the Brussels Automatic Code for\nCharacterizing High accUracy Spectra (BACCHUS) code which provides line-by-line\nelemental abundances. We derive abundances for Fe-peak (Fe, Ni), $\\alpha$-(O,\nMg, Si, Ca, Ti), light-(C, N), odd-Z(Al), and the s-process element (Ce) for\nfour members of the cluster. Our analysis yields a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]=\n$-$0.84 $\\pm$ 0.04, with no evidence for an intrinsic variation. We detect a\nsignificant abundance variation only in C and N, indicating the presence of\nmultiple populations. Ter 2 exhibits a typical $\\alpha$-enrichment, that\nfollows the trend of Galactic GCs. Additionally, our dynamical analysis reveals\nthat Terzan 2 is a bulge globular cluster with a chaotic orbit that is\ninfluenced by the Galactic bar but not trapped by it, displaying both prograde\nand retrograde motions within the inner bulge region. Overall, the chemical\npatterns observed in Terzan 2 are in good agreement with those of other CAPOS\nbulge clusters of similar metallicity.",

Specifically,\nour LoPE approach designs the first decision-maker (DM) a quantization step\nfunction of the Gaussian source state, making the target system state a\npiecewise linear function of the source with slope one. This approach contrasts\nwith Witsenhausen's original two-point strategy, which instead designs the\nsystem state itself to be a binary step. While the two-point strategy can\noutperform the linear strategy in estimation cost, it, along with its\nmulti-step extensions, typically requires a substantial power budget. Analogous\nto Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) communication for Gaussian channels, we\nshow that the binary LoPE strategy attains first-order optimality in the\nlow-power regime, matching the performance of the linear strategy as the power\nbudget increases from zero. Our analysis also provides an interpretation of the\npreviously observed near-optimal sloped step function (\"sawtooth\") structure to\nthe Witsenhausen counterexample: In the low-power regime, power saving is\nprioritized, in which case the LoPE strategy dominates, making the system state\na piecewise linear function with slope close to one.

However, while\nit has become easier to build prototype FEM models, creating a solver reusable\nbeyond its specific initial simulation setup remains difficult. Moreover,\nsimulation setups typically cover an ample input parameter space, and tracking\ncomplex metadata on research project time scales has become a challenge.

To enhance the strength of this approach,\nwe further investigate another two types of valid inequalities.

Second, we derive decision rule-based\nvalid inequalities, where linear decision rules and learning techniques are\nexplored respectively.

This appealing property is lost whenever the\npotential energy that appears in the partition function is\ntemperature-dependent: for instance, mean-field effective potential energies or\nthe quantum partition function in the path-integral formalism.

However, existing research lacks a\ncomprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted\nto isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a\nsystematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural\nperspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,\nand video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial\nUnderstanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial\nreasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of\nspatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the\nupper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial\nimagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient\nto achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we\nfind that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding\nwithin the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and\nnative MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future\nimprovements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.\nThese insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new\ndirections for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling\nand architectural tuning.",

    "abstract": "Since the development of the nonlocal correlation functional vdW-DF, the\nfamily of van der Waals density functionals has grown to better describe a wide\nvariety of systems. A recent generation of the vdW-DF family, vdW-DF3, featured\na newly-constructed form of the nonlocal correlation that more accurately\nmodeled molecular dimers, layered structures, and surface adsorption. However,\nit also revealed an intrinsic tradeoff in vdW-DF3's parametrization and\ninflexibility of exchange in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA),\nlimiting its accuracy for molecular crystals. In this paper we propose a new\noptimization of vdW-DF3 that is tailored to 3D molecular crystals. This\nfunctional, called vdW-DF3-mc, contains a new, tunable form of the exchange\nenhancement factor with parameters that directly correspond to physically\nrelevant qualities. In addition, within the nonlocal correlation, we prioritize\nsmoothness of the kernel switching function as a means of restoring flexibility\nto vdW-DF3's design. Testing vdW-DF3-mc on several benchmark sets, we achieve\nhighly accurate energetics and geometries for molecular crystals. This is\nparticularly evident for the case of polymorphs of ice, for which errors in the\nvolume and cohesive energy are on the order of only 1%, indicating very\npromising performance for important subcategories of molecular crystals, such\nas polymorphism and hydrogen-bonded solids.",

However,\nmost existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate\nmultiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and\ninaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward\nyet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and\nstructurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view\nimages and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D\nobject using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a\ntext description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture\nconsistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the\ntextures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.\nFor enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve\nthe 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also\nconditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to\nreconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as\nshark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1.

ISAC fulfills a brand new paradigm\nshift in wireless networks via the seamless interplay between communication and\nsensing within a unified network. However, the tight integration of these\nfunctionalities inevitably gives rise to various types of interference, posing\nsignificant challenges to existing ISAC waveform designs and rendering\ninterference management a critical concern. Inspired by the development\ntrajectory of wireless communications, different multiple access (MA)\ntechniques, such as orthogonal multiple access (OMA), space-division multiple\naccess (SDMA), and more recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and\nrate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), have been demonstrated to play a pivotal\nrole in efficiently utilizing limited spectrum resources, designing ISAC\nwaveforms, as well as managing inter-user interference and inter-functionality\ninterference in ISAC. Notably, the interplay between MA and ISAC presents\nmutually beneficial integration. On the one hand, ISAC helps MA techniques\nbetter exploit their interference management capability beyond the\ncommunication-only networks. On the other hand, different MA techniques serve\nas promising solutions for inter-functionality and inter-user interference\nmanagement in ISAC. In this paper, we deliver the first comprehensive tutorial\nof MA techniques in ISAC networks. Specifically, we illustrate the fundamental\nprinciples of ISAC, classify the diverse types of interference in different\nISAC systems, and compare MA-assisted ISAC designs, highlighting their\nrespective advantages and limitations.

    ],
    "abstract": "Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning\nmodels for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for\nordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is\nprone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the\nperformance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses\nthe problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image\nclassification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal\nAdaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy\nlabels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution\nLearning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in\nordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and\nstandard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than\ndiscarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and\nmake optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the\nproposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)\nand disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric\nGaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions\n(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.\nFor instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean\nabsolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to\n0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic\nnoise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive\nlabel correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance\nthe robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of\nnoisy data.",

Traditional travel-time-based\nlocation methods struggle to constrain depths due to imperfect station\ndistribution and the strong trade-off between source depth and origin time.\nIdentifying depth phases at regional distances is usually hindered by strong\nwave scattering, which is particularly challenging for low-magnitude events.\nDeep learning algorithms, capable of extracting various features from seismic\nwaveforms, including phase arrivals, phase amplitudes, as well as phase\nfrequency, offer promising constraints to earthquake depths. In this work, we\npropose a novel depth feature extraction network (named VGGDepth), which\ndirectly maps seismic waveforms to earthquake depth using three-component\nwaveforms. The network structure is adapted from VGG16 in computer vision. It\nis designed to take single-station three-component waveforms as inputs and\nproduce depths as outputs, achieving a direct mapping from waveforms to depths.\nTwo scenarios are considered in our model development: (1) training and testing\nsolely on the same seismic station, and (2) generalizing by training and\ntesting on different seismic stations within a particular region. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our methodology using seismic data from the\n2016-2017 Central Apennines, Italy earthquake sequence. Results demonstrate\nthat earthquake depths can be estimated from single stations with uncertainties\nof hundreds of meters. These uncertainties are further reduced by averaging\nresults from multiple stations.

In the present work, we controlled\nthe mechanical properties of clay suspensions by incorporating additives and\nstudied the interfacial instabilities that resulted when these suspensions were\nradially displaced by water in a Hele-Shaw cell. When the elasticity of clay\nwas low, the interfacial dynamics exhibited features of nonlinear viscous\nfingering in heterogeneous media. By tuning the nature and content of additives\nthat delay clay aging, we uncovered two novel propagation mechanisms: pattern\ngrowth \\textit{via} skewering and zig-zag finger propagation. These patterns\nhave hitherto never been observed in experiments with colloidal systems. For\nmoderate clay elasticities, we demonstrate here that shear-thinning-induced\nflow anisotropy leads to the formation of dendrites with dominant side\nbranches. As clay elasticity increases due to the incorporation of salts, the\nenergy required to create fractures becomes smaller than that for system-wide\nyielding. This scenario is characterized by the emergence of viscoelastic\nfractures.

Both theory and evidence suggest an ambiguous\nrelationship between compliance and geographic proximity to tax offices. We\nstudy this issue using a large-scale natural field experiment with Indonesia's\ntax authority involving 12,000 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).\nBusinesses were randomly assigned to receive deterrence, information, or public\ngoods letters, or no message. All letters improved compliance, with deterrence\nmessages producing the largest gains - substantially increasing filing rates\nand raising monthly tax payments. Each dollar spent on deterrence letters\ngenerated about US$30 in additional revenue over the course of a year. We\nobserve high compliance among non-treated MSMEs near metropolitan tax offices\nand find that enforcement messages successfully raise compliance in\nnon-metropolitan regions to comparable levels. However, targeting already\ncompliant MSMEs near metropolitan tax offices backfires, underscoring the need\nfor geographically tailored tax administration strategies. These results\nprovide novel experimental evidence on the relation between geographic\nproximity and the effectiveness of tax enforcement, helping to reconcile mixed\nfindings in the tax compliance literature.",

    "abstract": "In the United States, schizophrenia (SCZ) carries a race and sex disparity\nthat may be explained by clinician bias - a belief held by a clinician about a\npatient that prevents impartial clinical decision making. The emergency\ndepartment (ED) is marked by higher rates of stress that lead to clinicians\nrelying more on implicit biases during decision making. In this work, we\nconsidered a large cohort of psychiatric patients in the ED from the Mount\nSinai Health System (MSHS) in New York City to investigate the effects of\nclinician bias on SCZ diagnosis while controlling for known risk factors and\npatient sociodemographic information. Clinician bias was quantified as the\nratio of negative to total sentences within a patient's first ED note. We\nutilized a logistic regression to predict SCZ diagnosis given patient race,\nsex, age, history of trauma or substance use disorder, and the ratio of\nnegative sentences. Our findings showed that an increased ratio of negative\nsentences is associated with higher odds of obtaining a SCZ diagnosis [OR (95%\nCI)=1.408 (1.361-1.456)]. Identifying as male [OR (95% CI)=1.112 (1.055-1.173)]\nor Black [OR (95% CI)=1.081(1.031-1.133)] increased one's odds of being\ndiagnosed with SCZ. However, from an intersectional lens, Black female patients\nwith high SES have the highest odds of obtaining a SCZ diagnosis [OR (95%\nCI)=1.629 (1.535-1.729)]. Results such as these suggest that SES does not act\nas a protective buffer against SCZ diagnosis in all patients, demanding more\nattention to the quantification of health disparities. Lastly, we demonstrated\nthat clinician bias is operational with real world data and related to\nincreased odds of obtaining a stigmatizing diagnosis such as SCZ.",

The strange quark matter (SQM) is\ndescribed with the well-known Nambu-Jona-Lasino (NJL) model and the\nself-interacting fermionic DM is included in a systematic manner. The\nself-interaction of DM is of four-Fermi type and the overall DM density is\nconsidered as a function of the baryon density of SQM with two free parameters\n($\\alpha$, $\\rho_{sc}$). This work is the first to consider four-Fermi\ninteractions between fermionic DM and SQM in DMSQSs. Certain experiments like\nLZ, XENON, DarkSide, CRESST, and LHC have almost ruled out the possibility of\ncontact interaction between SQM and massive DM (in GeV order). Recently, the\nquest for sub-GeV DM has garnered significant attention. We show that recent\nastrophysical constraints on the structural properties of compact stars also do\nnot support the presence of massive DM in DMSQSs. On the other hand, we find\nsub-GeV DM to successfully concur with such observational constraints. We also\ncalculate the fundamental $f$-mode frequency ($f_f$) of the DMSQSs, which shows\nuniversality with compactness, mean density, and tidal deformability.

In this work, we focus on\nmulti-step cloth folding, a representative deformable-object manipulation task\nthat requires both structured long-horizon planning and fine-grained visual\nperception. To this end, we propose a unified framework that integrates a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM)-based planner, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based\nperception system, and a task execution module. Specifically, the LLM-based\nplanner decomposes high-level language instructions into low-level action\nprimitives, bridging the semantic-execution gap, aligning perception with\naction, and enhancing generalization. The VLM-based perception module employs a\nSigLIP2-driven architecture with a bidirectional cross-attention fusion\nmechanism and weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) fine-tuning to\nachieve language-conditioned fine-grained visual grounding. Experiments in both\nsimulation and real-world settings demonstrate the method's effectiveness. In\nsimulation, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 2.23, 1.87, and 33.3\non seen instructions, unseen instructions, and unseen tasks, respectively. On a\nreal robot, it robustly executes multi-step folding sequences from language\ninstructions across diverse cloth materials and configurations, demonstrating\nstrong generalization in practical scenarios.

To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,\ndesigned from both structural and data perspectives.

While these\nefforts demonstrate the vitality of the field, they also highlight increasing\nfragmentation, with redundant innovation and siloed designs hindering\ncross-domain interoperability. These challenges underscore the need for a\nsystematic perspective to guide the development of scalable, secure, and\nsustainable AI agent ecosystems. To address this need, this paper provides the\nfirst systematic analysis of AI agent communication from the standpoint of\nInternet architecture-the most successful global-scale distributed system in\nhistory. Specifically, we distill decades of Internet evolution into five key\nelements that are directly relevant to agent communication: scalability,\nsecurity, real-time performance, high performance, and manageability. We then\nuse these elements to examine both the opportunities and the bottlenecks in\ndeveloping robust multi-agent ecosystems. Overall, this paper bridges Internet\narchitecture and AI agent communication for the first time, providing a new\nlens for guiding the sustainable growth of AI agent communication ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a central problem in\nastrophysics, with current observations providing only limited constraints on\nthe underlying mechanisms. One possible growth channel is stellar accretion via\nthe Hill's mechanism, wherein a SMBH tidally breaks up a passing binary star,\ncapturing and eventually accreting a member of the binary. We adopt a model to\npredict capture rates from parameters that include the central number density\nof stars, the stellar velocity dispersion, the binary fraction, and black hole\nmass. We then use this model to estimate the growth of SMBHs across a range of\ngalactic environments. In a data set of 30 galaxies of various types and\nmasses, we identify two candidates with SMBHs for which stellar accretion may\nbe a driver of recent growth. Closer to home, a recent analysis of observed\nhypervelocity stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) implicates binary\nstar interactions with a massive black hole. Every hypervelocity star produced\nin this way leaves a bound partner that may be accreted, providing an active\ngrowth channel for the LMC's black hole.",

    "abstract": "Classic adaptive designs for time-to-event trials are based on the log-rank\nstatistic and its increments. Thereby, only information from the time-to-event\nendpoint on which the selected log-rank statistic is based may be used for\ndata-dependent design modifications in interim analyses. Further information\n(e.g. surrogate parameters) may not be used. As pointed out in a letter by P.\nBauer and M. Posch in 2004, adaptive tests on overall survival (OS) based on\nthe log-rank statistic do in general not control the significance level if\ninterim information on progression-free survival (PFS) is used for sample size\nadjustments, because progression is associated with increased risk of death.\n  In contrast, in adaptive designs for time-to-event trials, which are\nconstructed according to the principle of patient-wise separation, all trial\ndata observed in interim analyses may be used for design modifications without\ncompromizing type one error rate control. But by design, this comes at the\nprice of incomplete use of the primary endpoint data in the final test decision\nor worst-case considerations which lead to a loss of power. Thus, the\npatient-wise separation approach cannot be regarded as a general solution to\nthe problem described by Bauer and Posch.\n  We address this problem within the framework of a comprehensive independent\nincrements approach. We develop adaptive tests on OS in which sample size\nadjustments may be based on the observed interim data of both OS and PFS, while\navoiding the problems of the patient-wise separation approach. We provide this\nmethodology for both single-arm trials, in which a new therapy is compared with\na pre-specified deterministic reference, and randomized trials, in which a new\ntherapy is compared with a concurrent control group.

The BH accretion disk is highly eccentric, with spirally\nshaped accreting and decreting zones. Its flow field is consistent with\nelliptical orbits confocal at the BH. The disk structure relates to its\nfeeding: a cold 3D accretion cone channels matter from opposite the L1 point\nand within 2/3d from the BH toward the disk. Above and below the disk, a\npolytropic atmosphere establishes, with temperatures one-tenth of the virial\ntemperature. A hot cocoon of shocked wind material engulfs the BH accretion\nstructure on scales of d/10.

While feature-based\npost-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature\nspace without changing network parameters, they often require access to\ntraining data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This\nmay not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed\nClassifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of\nsubspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the\nclassifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the\noriginal data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.\nSubsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature\nreconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD\ndetection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while\nachieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks.

    "abstract": "The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit. While\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their\napplication has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within\nhuman-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open\nquestion. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver\nfor the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved\nfragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint\nscaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative\nself-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a\nviable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy\nprocess, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the\nscoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior\nwork may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of\nLLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed\ngreedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a\nhuman-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,\nthough its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight\ntwo major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the\nengineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,\nand the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search\nfor novel solutions.",

Existing methods\nattempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or\ntest-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than\nimposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these\nobjectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce\nLearn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for\ntest-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to\ntrain a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the\ndiffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a\nlearned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a\nsurprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces\nrather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion\nstrategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically\nimproves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to\n0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks.

To\naccount for topology change, one is led to allow the creation and annihilation\nof closed and open universes in a framework often called third quantization or\nuniverse field theory. We argue that since topology change in gravity is a rare\nevent, its contribution to exponentially late-time physics is universally\ndescribed by a Poisson process. This universal Poisson process is responsible\nfor the plateau in the multi-boundary generalization of the spectral form\nfactor at late times. In the Fock space of closed baby universes, this\nuniversality implies that the statistics of the total number of baby universes\nis captured by a coherent state. Allowing for the creation of asymptotic open\nuniverses calls for a noncommutative generalization of a Poisson process. We\npropose such an operator algebraic framework, called Poissonization, which\ntakes as input the observable algebra and a (unnormalized) state of a quantum\nsystem and outputs a von Neumann algebra of a many-body theory represented on\nits symmetric Fock space. Physically, Poissonization is a generalization of the\ncoherent state vacua of bipartite quantum systems or matrix quantum mechanics.\nThe multi-boundary correlators of the Marolf-Maxfield toy model of baby\nuniverses, and the sum over bordisms of closed-open 2D topological quantum\nfield theory, are entirely captured by Poissonization.

Leveraging radar's strong penetration\ncapability, we introduce a radar-based 3D environmental perception framework as\na viable alternative. It comprises three core modules designed for dense and\naccurate semantic perception: 1) Parallel frame accumulation to enhance\nsignal-to-noise ratio of radar raw data. 2) A diffusion model-based\nhierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts\nthen generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically\ndesigned sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data.\nWe conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a\nself-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results\ndemonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic\nprediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously\nreducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively.\nFurthermore, our approach achieves complete reconstruction and accurate\nclassification of thin structures such as poles and wires-which existing\nmethods struggle to perceive-highlighting its potential for dense and accurate\n3D radar perception.",

We present a two-part study using a DeepXDE PINN for a six-species\ngeneralised Lotka-Volterra (gLV) model with a known step input and fixed,\nspecies-specific step amplitudes, under synthetic noise.\n  Part A: Accuracy ablation. Starting from a broad-init baseline, we\nsystematically vary constrained initialisation, parameter scaling, L2\nregularisation with loss-weighting, split training with auxiliary observations,\nfunction constraints, adaptive collocation, hyperparameter tuning, and\noptimisers (Adam,L-BFGS).

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate\ndifferent modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint\nlearning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities\noverwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from\neach modality and the inter-modality interaction information. Existing\nstrategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient\nmodulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods\nremain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it\narises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This\nlimitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance\nlearning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective\ninteractions between modalities and better utilization of information from\nindividual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce\nUnidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the\nconventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme.\nUDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned\nrepresentations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore,\nthe dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to\nthe task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By\ndecoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI\nprevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal\nfeature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms\nexisting methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance\nimprovement in multimodal learning tasks.",

Unlike speech,\nsinging involves richer emotional nuance, dynamic prosody, and lyric-based\nsemantics, requiring the synthesis of fine-grained, temporally coherent facial\nmotion. Existing speech-driven approaches often produce oversimplified,\nemotionally flat, and semantically inconsistent results, which are insufficient\nfor singing animation. To address this, we propose Think2Sing, a\ndiffusion-based framework that leverages pretrained large language models to\ngenerate semantically coherent and temporally consistent 3D head animations,\nconditioned on both lyrics and acoustics. A key innovation is the introduction\nof motion subtitles, an auxiliary semantic representation derived through a\nnovel Singing Chain-of-Thought reasoning process combined with acoustic-guided\nretrieval. These subtitles contain precise timestamps and region-specific\nmotion descriptions, serving as interpretable motion priors. We frame the task\nas a motion intensity prediction problem, enabling finer control over facial\nregions and improving the modeling of expressive motion. To support this, we\ncreate a multimodal singing dataset with synchronized video, acoustic\ndescriptors, and motion subtitles, enabling diverse and expressive motion\nlearning. Extensive experiments show that Think2Sing outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in realism, expressiveness, and emotional fidelity,\nwhile also offering flexible, user-controllable animation editing.",

One expects that a\nsimilar result for surfaces in projective space should not be true, as it is\nfalse, the generalization in higher dimensions of Castelnuovo's Rationality\nTheorem. In this paper, the first example of such behaviour is provided,\nexhibiting a rational surface in the projective space with negative log-Kodaira\ndimension, which is not Cremona equivalent to a plane.

    "abstract": "A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response\napplications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in\ncomplex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent\ncommunication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known\nas Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing\ncapabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate\nexplicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in\nmaintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing.\nRecent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the\nclassical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep\nlearning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent\nswarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric\nfeatures extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It\nincorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel,\ndifferentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that\npromotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph\nLaplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent\ngathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must\ngather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing\nanalytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while\nmaintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes. While the\nanalytical solution guarantees cohesion, it is often too slow in practice. In\ntime-critical scenarios, such as emergency response operations where lives are\nat risk, slower analytical methods are impractical and justify the loss of some\nagents within the swarm. This paper presents and analyzes this trade-off in\ndetail.",

While near-optimal algorithms have been developed for simulating\nmany-body quantum dynamics, algorithms for their open system counterparts\nremain less well investigated. We address the problem of simulating\ngeometrically local many-body open quantum systems interacting with a\nstationary Gaussian environment. Under a smoothness assumption on the\nsystem-environment interaction, we develop near-optimal algorithms that, for a\nmodel with $N$ spins and evolution time $t$, attain a simulation error $\\delta$\nin the system-state with $\\mathcal{O}(Nt(Nt/\\delta)^{o(1)})$ gates,\n$\\mathcal{O}(t(Nt/\\delta)^{o(1)})$ parallelized circuit depth and\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(N(Nt/\\delta)^{o(1)})$ ancillas. We additionally show that,\nif only simulating local observables is of interest, then the circuit depth of\nthe digital algorithm can be chosen to be independent of the system size $N$.\nThis provides theoretical evidence for the utility of these algorithms for\nsimulating physically relevant models, where typically local observables are of\ninterest, on pre-fault tolerant devices. Finally, for the limiting case of\nMarkovian dynamics with commuting jump operators, we propose two algorithms\nbased on sampling a Wiener process and on a locally dilated Hamiltonian\nconstruction, respectively. These algorithms reduce the asymptotic gate\ncomplexity on $N$ compared to currently available algorithms in terms of the\nrequired number of geometrically local gates.",

Our experiments based on media frame diversification show an\nimprovement in exposure to previously unclicked frames up to 50%.

However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still\nface challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences\nbetween regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations\ncaused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the\ncounting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose\nDSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature\ncorrelation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and\na Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it\ncaptures the potential feature correlations in density variations and\nrepresentation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction\nmodule that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a\ndensity-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch\nestablishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global\nrepresentation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to\nthe two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,\nwhich enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve\ncounting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments\non three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Citrus crops are of immense economic and agricultural importance worldwide,\nbut are highly vulnerable to destructive diseases such as Huanglongbing (citrus\ngreening) and citrus canker. These diseases often remain asymptomatic in early\nstages, making timely diagnosis difficult and resulting in substantial yield\nand quality losses. Rapid, non-invasive, and accurate early detection methods\nare therefore essential for effective disease management and sustainable citrus\nproduction. Raman spectroscopy, with its molecular specificity, non-destructive\nnature, and minimal sample preparation requirements, has emerged as a promising\ndiagnostic technology for this purpose. This review outlines recent advances in\napplying Raman spectroscopy for the early detection of Huanglongbing and citrus\ncanker, with a focus on spectral biomarkers that reflect pathogen-induced\nphysiological and biochemical alterations in citrus tissues. Comparative\ninsights are provided between portable, in-field Raman devices and conventional\nlaboratory-based systems, highlighting diagnostic accuracy, operational\nfeasibility, and deployment potential. The integration of chemometric and\nmachine learning techniques for enhanced classification and automated disease\nrecognition is examined. By consolidating current research, this review\nunderscores the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a field-deployable solution\nfor precision agriculture. It discusses future challenges and opportunities for\nthe large-scale adoption of this technology in citrus orchard monitoring.",

We identify 30 variable\nULIRGs with statistically significant MIR variability. The variability is\nobserved on timescales of a few years, implying that the MIR-emitting regions\nare compact ($\\lesssim 1$ pc). The difference between maximum and minimum $W2$\n(4.6 ${\\rm \\mu}$m) band luminosity ($\\Delta L_{\\rm W2}$) of the 30 variable\nULIRGs range from $\\Delta L_{W2}$ = $7\\times10^{42}$ to $5\\times 10^{44}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$. The $\\Delta L_{W2}$ of 25 variable ULIRGs out of 30 are greater than\n$\\Delta L_{W2}$ = $1\\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, surpassing the MIR luminosity\n{range} observed in known supernovae (SNe; $L_{\\rm 3.6\\ {\\rm \\mu m}}$ and\n$L_{\\rm 4.5\\ {\\rm \\mu m}}$ < 10$^{42.3}$ erg s$^{-1}$). Therefore, the MIR\nvariabilities in these 25 ULIRGs are most likely driven by tidal disruption\nevents (TDEs) or intrinsic changes in their active galactic nuclei (AGN) torus\nemission. Our sample includes hard X-ray detected AGNs (e.g., UGC 05101) and\npreviously reported TDE candidates (IRAS F01004-2237, IRAS 05189-2524). All 25\nalso exhibit at least one AGN signature(s) besides the MIR variability,\nsuggesting that even if the MIR variability originates from TDEs, the black\nholes responsible are likely AGNs.

Although experimental studies and kinetic models have\nbeen developed to investigate its fuel chemistry, discrepancies remain between\nmodeled and measured ignition delay times at low temperatures. In this work, we\ncharacterize previously unreported direct interaction pathways between N2O and\nunsaturated hydrocarbons C2H4, C3H6, C2H2, and C3H4 through quantum chemistry\ncalculations, comprehensive kinetic modeling, and experimental validation.\nThese reactions proceed via O-atom addition from N2O to unsaturated\nhydrocarbons, forming five membered ring intermediates that decompose into N2\nand hydrocarbon specific products. Distinct mechanistic differences are\nidentified between alkenes and alkynes, arising from the disparity in N C bond\nlengths within the intermediates 1.480 A vs. 1.381 A, which governs their\ndecomposition pathways. The corresponding rate coefficients are determined and\nimplemented into multiple kinetic models, with autoignition simulations showing\na pronounced promoting effect on model reactivity and improved agreement with\nexperiments, especially at low temperatures. Flux analysis further reveals that\nthe new pathways suppress conventional inhibiting channels while enabling\naldehyde and ketone forming pathways that enhance overall reactivity.

However, it is essential in\nthe context of 6G, which is expected to support reliable communication to\nenable real-time autonomous systems. This paper proposes a joint communication\nand control solution consisting of: i) a deep Koopman model capable of learning\nand mapping complex nonlinear dynamics into linear representations in an\nembedding space, predicting missing states, and planning control actions over a\nfuture time horizon; and ii) a scheduling algorithm that schedules\nsensor-controller communication based on Lyapunov optimization, which\ndynamically allocates communication resources based on system stability and\navailable resources. Control actions are computed within this embedding space\nusing a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to ensure system stability. The\nproposed model is evaluated under varying conditions and its performance is\ncompared against two baseline models; one that assumes systems are\ncontrol-affine, and another that assumes identical control actions in the\nembedding and original spaces. The evaluation results demonstrate that the\nproposed model outperforms both baselines, by achieving stability while\nrequiring fewer transmissions.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the role of quantum geometry in the Meissner response for\nodd-frequency superconducting pairs in multiband systems. Odd-frequency pairing\nis traditionally associated with a paramagnetic Meissner response, which raises\nquestions about the stability of the superconducting phase, especially in\nmultiband systems where odd-frequency pairing is ubiquitous. Using analytical\ncalculations in a general two-band, we show that the quantum geometric\ncontribution to the Meissner response from odd-frequency pairs is always\ndiamagnetic for its interband processes, while intraband processes always yield\na paramagnetic response. With odd-frequency pairing itself generated by\ninterband pairing, an overall diamagnetic response may often be anticipated. We\nconfirm these results with numerical calculations of models with both flat and\ndispersive bands. In flat band systems, where geometric effects dominate, the\ndiamagnetic odd-frequency response can even exceed the even-frequency\ncontribution, making odd-frequency pairs the primary source of the diamagnetic\nMeissner response. In a dispersive two-band system with finite quantum\ngeometry, we similarly find a robust diamagnetic contribution from\nodd-frequency pairing, even when the total response turns paramagnetic due to\neven-frequency contributions. These results establish that quantum geometry\nstabilizes odd-frequency superconductivity and also identify flat-band\nmaterials as candidates for realizing odd-frequency superconductivity with a\ndiamagnetic Meissner effect.",

    "abstract": "The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative\neffect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has\nproven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and\ntransparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a\nviable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of\ntacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information\nretrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking\nand augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an\nengineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for\neach question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem\nwith the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse\nCardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose\nmodel to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase\nreliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black\nbox effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\\% better than the previously\npresented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the\nlimiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering,\nserving as a call to action for future research.

By formulating the spin\npolarization along the magnetic field direction, we derive modified\npolarization-sensitive observables and demonstrate how kinematic selections can\nretain nonvanishing polarization signals even after ensemble averaging.\nFurthermore, we propose that the relative polarization of $\\tau^-$ and\n$\\tau^+$, accessible through complementary angular ranges of their decay\nproducts, serves as a sensitive observable for potential CP-violating effects.\nThis framework provides a pathway for future experimental studies at the LHC\nand future colliders to exploit polarized $\\tau$ decays in UPCs as an\napplication of the strong electromagnetic fields to probe new sources of CP\nviolation.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the finite-time stabilization of a class of nonlinear\ninfinite-dimensional systems. First, we consider a bounded matched perturbation\nin its linear form. It is shown that by using a set-valued function, both the\nconvergence objective (finite-time) and the rejection of perturbations are\nachieved. Second, we consider a class of nonlinear systems and design a\nfeedback control that ensures the closed-loop system is finite-time stable. All\nproofs presented in this paper regarding convergence are based on Lyapunov\ntheory. The existence of solutions to the closed-loop system and its\nwell-posedness are established using maximal monotone theory. To illustrate the\napplicability of the theoretical results, a heat equation is considered as an\napplication of the main results.",

However, there is a notable gap between the performance of\nmedical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world\nclinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams\nfail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework\nthat moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale,\nhigh-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework\ncomprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic\nclinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical\nRubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation\nmetrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter\nmedical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement\nlearning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\nalgorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other\nopen-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a\nscore above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously\nexceeded only by GPT-5.

The collected sensor data are examined\nthrough statistical and time series methodologies, and subsequently modeled\nusing an auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) process. This\nmodeling approach enables the transformation of the sensor's raw noise into a\nGaussian white noise sequence, which serves as the basis for generating random\nbits.

Omics features are ranked\nusing a voting-theory-inspired aggregation mechanism across models and\nsubsamples, while the optimal number of features is selected via a Pareto\nfront, balancing predictive accuracy and model sparsity without any\nuser-defined thresholds. When applied to multi-omics datasets from three\npancreatic cancer cohorts, hEFS identifies significantly fewer and more stable\nbiomarkers compared to the conventional, late-fusion CoxLasso models, while\nmaintaining comparable discrimination performance. Implemented within the\nopen-source mlr3fselect R package, hEFS offers a robust, interpretable, and\nclinically valuable tool for prognostic modelling and biomarker discovery in\nhigh-dimensional survival settings.",

    "abstract": "Simulating the long-timescale dynamics of biomolecules is a central challenge\nin computational science. While enhanced sampling methods can accelerate these\nsimulations, they rely on pre-defined collective variables that are often\ndifficult to identify. A recent generative model, LD-FPG, demonstrated that\nthis problem could be bypassed by learning to sample the static equilibrium\nensemble as all-atom deformations from a reference structure, establishing a\npowerful method for all-atom ensemble generation. However, while this approach\nsuccessfully captures a system's probable conformations, it does not model the\ntemporal evolution between them. Here we extend LD-FPG with a temporal\npropagator that operates within the learned latent space and compare three\nclasses: (i) score-guided Langevin dynamics, (ii) Koopman-based linear\noperators, and (iii) autoregressive neural networks. Within a unified\nencoder-propagator-decoder framework, we evaluate long-horizon stability,\nbackbone and side-chain ensemble fidelity, and functional free-energy\nlandscapes. Autoregressive neural networks deliver the most robust long\nrollouts; score-guided Langevin best recovers side-chain thermodynamics when\nthe score is well learned; and Koopman provides an interpretable, lightweight\nbaseline that tends to damp fluctuations. These results clarify the trade-offs\namong propagators and offer practical guidance for latent-space simulators of\nall-atom protein dynamics.",

This\ntwo-stage framework is built on the assumption that more accurate predictions\nresult in solutions that are closer to the actual optimal solution. However,\nproviding evidence for this assumption in the context of complex, constrained\noptimization problems is challenging and often overlooked in the literature.\nSimulating predictions of machine learning models offers a way to\n(experimentally) analyze how prediction error impacts solution quality without\nthe need to train real models. Complementing an algorithm from the literature\nfor simulating binary classification, we introduce a new algorithm for\nsimulating predictions of multiclass classifiers.

Additionally, we apply these algorithms to assess the\nperformance of a Predict-Then-Optimize algorithm for a machine scheduling\nproblem.

This\nproperty is particularly useful in applications such as electronic voting and\ndigital cash, where user anonymity is important. In a blind signature scheme,\nthe user blinds their message before sending it to the signer, who signs the\nblinded message. The user then unblinds the signed message to obtain a valid\nsignature that can be verified publicly, ensuring that the signer cannot trace\nthe signed message back to the original unblinded version. A good analogy is\nplacing the message inside an envelope and having the envelope signed. Once the\nenvelope is opened, the signature remains valid for the enclosed message,\nensuring that the content remains confidential.\n  Such constructions provide anonymity and privacy to the user but given a\npractical quantum computer, the security of traditional crypto-systems\nproviding such features will be broken. To address this, the development of\nquantum-resistant cryptographic protocols is essential for maintaining the\nsecurity of digital transactions and data. Aligning with the same goal, this\nwork aims to thoroughly review the background of lattice-based blind\nsignatures.

    "abstract": "Cement paste serves as the universal binder in concrete, formed by mixing\nwater with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). In its fresh state, cement paste is\na suspension in which the initial particle inventory continuously dissolves,\nwhile simultaneously, a growing population of colloidal calcium silica-hydrate\n(C-S-H) particles forms and progressively builds a percolated structure that\ndensifies and hardens through hydration. Like most colloidal gels, cement paste\nis sensitive to external stimuli such as mechanical vibrations and temperature\nvariations. Here, we show that power ultrasound (PUS) applied to OPC paste\nduring the very early stages of hydration significantly alters the mechanical\nproperties of the hardened material. Freshly prepared cement pastes are exposed\nto PUS at varying durations and intensities before curing for 28 days.\nMicro-indentation testing at the scale of tens of microns reveals that\nincreasing PUS amplitude and prolonged PUS exposure degrade the\nmicro-mechanical properties of hardened cement paste, making it more ductile.\nThis softening behavior evolves continuously with exposure conditions and is\nconsistent with an increase in porosity, likely caused by micro-cracks induced\nby PUS. This scenario is further supported by micro-scratch testing, which\nshows higher levels of acoustic emission in PUS-exposed samples. Finally,\nnano-indentation confirms that the properties of the individual phases\ncomposing the hardened paste -- low-density and high-density C-S-H -- remain\nlargely unaffected. These findings offer valuable experimental insights into\nnovel pathways for modifying the mechanical properties of reactive colloidal\ngels.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the\nwide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.\nThe latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,\nbut some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect\nrail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such\nas You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for\ndefect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain\nlimited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to\nnormal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion\narchitecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision\ntransformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a\nVision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers\n(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:\nrail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.\nExperimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our\nmultimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points\ncompared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms\nstatistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.",

Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic\nscenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive\nframes from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address\nthis shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call\nthe \"Inherent Temporal Dependencies\" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in\nITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from\ntracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes\nof an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental\nanalysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these\nmethods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we\nbuild upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization\nstrategy to improve memory-based TTA methods.

    "abstract": "A $k$-mismatch square is a string of the form $XY$ where $X$ and $Y$ are two\nequal-length strings that have at most $k$ mismatches. Kolpakov and Kucherov\n[Theor. Comput. Sci., 2003] defined two notions of $k$-mismatch repeats, called\n$k$-repetitions and $k$-runs, each representing a sequence of consecutive\n$k$-mismatch squares of equal length. They proposed algorithms for computing\n$k$-repetitions and $k$-runs working in $O(nk \\log k + output)$ time for a\nstring of length $n$ over an integer alphabet, where $output$ is the number of\nthe reported repeats. We show that $output=O(nk \\log k)$, both in case of\n$k$-repetitions and $k$-runs, which implies that the complexity of their\nalgorithms is actually $O(nk \\log k)$. We apply this result to computing\nparameterized squares.\n  A parameterized square is a string of the form $XY$ such that $X$ and $Y$\nparameterized-match, i.e., there exists a bijection $f$ on the alphabet such\nthat $f(X) = Y$. Two parameterized squares $XY$ and $X'Y'$ are equivalent if\nthey parameterized match. Recently Hamai et al. [SPIRE 2024] showed that a\nstring of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\\sigma$ contains less than\n$n\\sigma$ non-equivalent parameterized squares, improving an earlier bound by\nKociumaka et al. [Theor. Comput. Sci., 2016]. We apply our bound for\n$k$-mismatch repeats to propose an algorithm that reports all non-equivalent\nparameterized squares in $O(n\\sigma \\log \\sigma)$ time. We also show that the\nnumber of non-equivalent parameterized squares can be computed in $O(n \\log n)$\ntime. This last algorithm applies to squares under any substring compatible\nequivalence relation and also to counting squares that are distinct as strings.\nIn particular, this improves upon the $O(n\\sigma)$-time algorithm of\nGawrychowski et al. [CPM 2023] for counting order-preserving squares that are\ndistinct as strings if $\\sigma = \\omega(\\log n)$.",

However, the O(L^2) computational complexity of the\nTransformer architecture hinders efficient long-sequence processing, while the\nMamba architecture tends to become unstable when scaling parameters and data.\nTo address these challenges, this paper proposes AudioRWKV (A-RWKV), a highly\nefficient and stable architecture for audio modeling. Specifically, we inherit\nthe stable and efficient recurrent formulation of RWKV7 and replace its 1D\ntoken-shift operation with a 2D depthwise separable convolution to better\ncapture local spectro-temporal patterns. Furthermore, we adapt the original\ncausal WKV kernel into a bidirectional WKV kernel (Bi-WKV), enabling global\ncontext modeling over the entire audio sequence while maintaining linear\ncomputational complexity. Benefiting from the inherent stability of the RWKV7\nfoundation, A-RWKV scales seamlessly to larger model sizes. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that, under the same linear-model regime, A-RWKV-S (22M)\nachieves performance parity with AuM-B (92M) while exhibiting more stable\nthroughput than AST; for long-form audio (~5 minutes 28 seconds), WKV7 achieves\nup to a 13.3X speedup in processing.",

While $t^3$VAE improves robustness\nvia heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent\nvolume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this\nissue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.\nTo this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class\n\\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing\ndominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form\nobjective derived from the $\\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for\nclass-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of\nStudent's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,\nConditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE\nand Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In\nper-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional\nGaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models\nremain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\\rho \\lesssim 3$), our approach\nsubstantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme\nregimes.",

    "abstract": "The accurate mathematical modeling of droplet impact dynamics on\nmicro-structured surfaces is fundamental to understanding and predicting\ncomplex fluid behaviors relevant to a wide range of engineering and scientific\napplications. In particular, the pancake bouncing phenomenon--systematically\nstudied by Liu et al. (Nature Physics, 2014)--on superhydrophobic\nmicro-structured substrates presents significant theoretical challenges.\nCentral to these challenges is the need to construct rigorous mathematical\nmodels that capture the intricate influence of substrate micro/nanostructures\non droplet dynamics. This requires the development of robust formulations for\nsurface tension, contact line dynamics, and the interaction forces between\nfluid and solid structures. In this work, we formulate a nonlocal mathematical\nframework for the simulation of 3D pancake bouncing on superhydrophobic\nmicro-cone arrays. The model incorporates intermolecular attractive forces to\nrepresent droplet surface tension, and we provide a strict theoretical\nderivation linking these forces quantitatively to the macroscopic surface\ntension coefficient, thereby circumventing the reliance on empirical parameter\ntuning. The complex geometry of micro-cone arrays introduces fundamental\ndifficulties in defining local normal directions for contact algorithms. To\novercome this, we develop a nonlocal contact repulsion force model that governs\nfluid-solid interactions and ensures numerical stability under high Weber\nnumber conditions. Based on this mathematical foundation, we implement the\nmodel using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), enabling high-precision 3D\nsimulations. Computational experiments, validated against empirical data,\nconfirm the model's accuracy and robustness, while underscoring the key role of\nnumerical simulation in elucidating droplet-microstructure interactions.",

We\npresent a new code, PIMMS: Pulsation-Informed Magnetic Mapping of Stars, which\nuses a surface-integrated line profile model that accounts for the additional\nDoppler shifts of local lines caused by pulsations. It is then possible to fit\nthis model to spectropolarimetric observations, reconstructing maps of the\nsurface brightness, magnetic field, and the velocity field due to the\ncombination of pulsation and rotation. In this paper, we present and test PIMMS\nextensively, to understand its limitations and data requirements. Results. We\nfind that PIMMS can accurately reproduce the magnetic fields and brightness\ndistributions of realistic models of pulsating hot stars.

However, numerous\naccident reports show that ADSs still encounter challenges in complex\nscenarios. As a result, scenario-based testing has become essential for\nidentifying defects and ensuring reliable performance. In particular,\nreal-world accident reports offer valuable high-risk scenarios for more\ntargeted ADS testing. Despite their potential, existing methods often rely on\nvisual data, which demands large memory and manual annotation. Additionally,\nsince existing methods do not adopt standardized scenario formats (e.g.,\nOpenSCENARIO), the generated scenarios are often tied to specific platforms and\nADS implementations, limiting their scalability and portability. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Txt2Sce, a method for generating test scenarios in\nOpenSCENARIO format based on textual accident reports. Txt2Sce first uses a LLM\nto convert textual accident reports into corresponding OpenSCENARIO scenario\nfiles. It then generates a derivation-based scenario file tree through scenario\ndisassembly, scenario block mutation, and scenario assembly. By utilizing the\nderivation relationships between nodes in the scenario tree, Txt2Sce helps\ndevelopers identify the scenario conditions that trigger unexpected behaviors\nof ADSs. In the experiments, we employ Txt2Sce to generate 33 scenario file\ntrees, resulting in a total of 4,373 scenario files for testing the open-source\nADS, Autoware. The experimental results show that Txt2Sce successfully converts\ntextual reports into valid OpenSCENARIO files, enhances scenario diversity\nthrough mutation, and effectively detects unexpected behaviors of Autoware in\nterms of safety, smartness, and smoothness.",

Recent Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast,\nhigh-quality rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM prior for\nexpression control, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained geometry,\nexpressions, and full-head coverage. We introduce GRMM, the first full-head\nGaussian 3D morphable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual geometry\nand appearance components, additive refinements that recover high-frequency\ndetails such as wrinkles, fine skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM\nprovides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters\n(e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals\nthat capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's\ncapacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders\nrepresent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised\nimages for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering.\nTo learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first\ndataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust\ndisentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across\nmonocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression\ntransfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression\naccuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance.",

Traditional\nfrequency-constrained UC (FCUC) models typically rely on simplified first-order\nassumptions or scalar frequency metrics, such as frequency nadir, to indirectly\nenforce dynamic behavior. In contrast, our formulation explicitly models\ntime-domain frequency response using second-order dynamics, enabling a more\naccurate and flexible representation of generator behavior. The resulting\ndifferential equations are approximated with high fidelity using Bernstein\npolynomials, leading to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation\nthat remains computationally tractable for small-scale power systems.\n  Additionally, we introduce a new constraint based on the duration of\nfrequency excursions below a critical threshold, motivated by practical\nconcerns such as relay operation and equipment protection. A data-driven method\nis employed to relate the area under this threshold-computed as the integral of\nthe Bernstein approximation-to the duration of frequency deviation. The\nproposed framework is validated using real-world data from an island system in\nSpain, demonstrating enhanced frequency security with a moderate increase in\noperational cost.

These will survey large areas of the\nsky for transient mm sources as a byproduct of their observations, producing\nregular mm-transient alerts. The results from current experiments show they can\ndetect a wide variety of mm transients ranging from Galactic stars to\nextragalactic sources associated with AGNs and other energetic phenomena, and\nmoving Solar System objects such as asteroids. These results, and theoretical\npredictions, indicate that future mm/submm facilities will detect many kinds of\ntransient, including flaring stars, protostars, GRBs, TDEs, neutron star\nmergers, FBOTs, and SNe. New classes of mm-variable may be uncovered by CMB\nexperiments, and transient searches at other wavelengths, such as the optical\nLSST survey, will produce additional targets to followup with PRIMA. Predicted\nrates for extragalactic mm transients to be detected by CMB experiments range\nfrom 10s to 1000s of events over the lifetime of these projects. CMB-S4 is most\nrelevant for PRIMA, producing $\\sim$100 extragalactic transients per year.\nGalactic transients and variable sources will also be detected, but the most\ncommon Galactic transients, flaring stars, operate on such short timescales\nthat direct follow-up with PRIMA will not be feasible. Variable accretion rates\nin forming protostars, conversely, produce long term brightness variations that\nwill be ideal monitoring targets. The addition of mid- and far-IR data points\nfor all these sources can determine much about their radiation mechanisms and\nunderlying physics.

In\nthe Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal\nthat biases around caste and religion are particularly salient.

Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM\noutputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to\n17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the\nAI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any\nparameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding\nalgorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during\ngeneration. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding\nprocess, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and\ninfrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative\ndecoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In\nthis framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased\ngenerator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as\nthe verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust\ntrajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a\nfairness-by-speculation paradigm.

    "abstract": "Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have been applied to\ninterpret deep learning model results. However, applications that integrate XAI\nwith established hydrologic knowledge for process understanding remain limited.\nHere we present a framework that apply XAI method at point-scale to provide\ngranular interpretation and enable cross-scale aggregation of hydrologic\nresponses. Hydrologic connectivity is used as a demonstration of the value of\nthis approach. Soil moisture and its movement generated by physically based\nhydrologic model were used to train a long short-term memory (LSTM) network,\nwhose impacts of inputs were evaluated by XAI methods. Our results suggest that\nXAI-based classification can effectively identify the differences in the\nfunctional roles of various sub-regions at watershed scale. The aggregated XAI\nresults provide an explicit and quantitative indicator of hydrologic\nconnectivity development, offering insights to streamflow variation. This\nframework could be used to facilitate aggregation of other hydrologic responses\nto advance process understandings.",

This unified approach enables toolpath optimization across both surface\nand interior domains, allowing shell and infill paths to be generated via\nimplicit field interpolation. The printing sequence and multi-axis motion are\nthen jointly optimized over a continuous quaternion field. Our continuous\nformulation constructs the evolving printing object as a time-varying SDF,\nsupporting differentiable global collision handling throughout INF-based motion\nplanning. Compared to explicit-representation-based methods, INF-3DP achieves\nup to two orders of magnitude speedup and significantly reduces\nwaypoint-to-surface error.

Our\nspectrophotometric data set of SN 2016cvk covers the ultraviolet, optical, and\nnear-infrared wavelength region extending to +1681 d from the light curve peak;\nthe data is analysed and compared to other SN 2009ip-like transients. Archival\ndata reveals pre-outbursts of the progenitor with the first detection at -1219\nd. The light curve evolution of SN 2016cvk consists of two consecutive luminous\nevents A and B with peak magnitudes of M_V < -15.6 and M_r = -18.3 mag,\nrespectively. The spectra are dominated by Balmer emission lines that have a\ncomplex, multi-component evolution similar to other SN 2009ip-like targets. SN\n2016cvk is among the first detected SN 2009ip-like events that show early\n`flash ionisation' features of C III, N III, and He II, lasting for 16 +/- 5 d.\nOur late-time +405 d spectrum shows forbidden [Ca II], [Fe II], and [O I]\nfeatures with the latter detected particularly clearly for a SN 2009ip-like\nevent. The evolution of SN 2016cvk is similar to other SN 2009ip-like\ntransients, with some uncommon traits. The lack of a double-peaked structure in\nthe Balmer lines is likely caused by differences in the circumstellar medium\nstructure or viewing angle. The flash features in the early spectra propose\nabundances consistent with a red, yellow, or blue supergiant progenitor rather\nthan for example a luminous blue variable. The detection of [O I] in the +405 d\nspectrum suggests possible evidence of nucleosynthesised material generated in\na SN explosion.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a core paradigm in document\nquestion answering tasks. However, existing methods have limitations when\ndealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout\nanalysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information\nand struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category\ntreats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual\nlanguage models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages\nof text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes\nco-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and\nimages for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform\nstructured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text\nsegments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we\nretrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and\naggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level. Finally, we prompt\nthe VLM to generate the final response based on the co-modality retrieval\nresults. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\npure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks. The findings\nof this paper show that integrating co-modality information into the RAG\nframework in a unified manner is an effective approach to improving the\nperformance of complex document visual question-answering (VQA) systems.",

We introduce Halo, a system that brings batch\nquery processing and optimization into agentic LLM workflows. Halo represents\neach workflow as a structured query plan DAG and constructs a consolidated\ngraph for batched queries that exposes shared computation. Guided by a cost\nmodel that jointly considers prefill and decode costs, cache reuse, and GPU\nplacement, Halo performs plan-level optimization to minimize redundant\nexecution. Its runtime integrates adaptive batching, KV-cache sharing and\nmigration, along with compute-communication overlap to maximize hardware\nefficiency. Evaluation across six benchmarks shows that Halo achieves up to\n18.6x speedup for batch inference and 4.7x throughput improvement under online\nserving, scaling to workloads of tens of thousands of queries and complex\ngraphs. These gains are achieved without compromising output quality.

Recently, a full\nthermal phase curve of the planet at 15 microns with JWST has also been\nobserved, allowing for more information on the thermal structure of the planet.\n  We first looked for atmospheres capable of producing a dayside emission\ncompatible with secondary eclipse observations. We then tried to determine\nwhich of these are compatible with the observed thermal phase curve.\n  We used a 1D radiative-convective model and a 3D global climate model (GCM)\nto simulate a wide range of atmospheric compositions and surface pressures. We\nthen produced observables from these simulations and compared them to available\nemission observations.\n  We found several families of atmospheres compatible at 2-sigma with the\neclipse observations. Among them, some feature a flat phase curve and can be\nruled out with the observation, and some produce a phase curve still compatible\nwith the data (i.e., thin N2-CO2 atmospheres, and CO2 atmospheres rich in\nhazes). We also highlight different 3D effects that could not be predicted from\n1D studies (redistribution efficiency, atmospheric collapse).\n  The available observations of TRAPPIST-1 b are consistent with an airless\nplanet, which is the most likely scenario. A second possibility is a thin\nCO2-poor residual atmosphere. However, our study shows that different\natmospheric scenarios can result in a high eclipse depth at 15 microns. It may\ntherefore be hazardous, in general, to conclude on the presence of an\natmosphere from a single photometric point.",

This\npaper introduces a new orthogonal multicarrier waveform, namely Affine-Doppler\nDivision Multiplexing (ADDM), which can provide a generic framework and subsume\nthe existing OTFS and AFDM as a particular case. ADDM modulating information\nsymbols in the Affine-Doppler (A-D) domain based on a two-dimensional (2D)\ntransform can enjoy both excellent unambiguous Doppler and Doppler resolution,\nwhich is the same as AFDM but outperforms OTFS. Moreover, benefiting from the\n2D transform, the symbols block of ADDM in the A-D domain undergoes a 2D cyclic\nshift produced by the delay and the Doppler of the channel, similar to the 2D\ncyclic shift in the delay-Doppler domain of cyclic prefix (CP)-OTFS. This\noffers a potential to directly apply the state-of-the-art methods well-designed\nfor OTFS and AFDM to ADDM.

This\nprovides a classification of the subgroups of $\\mathrm{Mod}(S_g)$ that are\nisomorphic to $A_n \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_m$, up to a certain equivalence that we\ncall weak conjugacy. As an application, we show that for $n \\geq 7$, such a\nsubgroup of $\\mathrm{Mod}(S_g)$ cannot have an irreducible periodic mapping\nclass. Furthermore, we show that for $n \\geq 5$ and $n \\neq 6$, if the order of\nsuch a subgroup is greater than $5g-5$, then $m \\leq 26$. Moreover, for $g \\geq\n2$ and $n \\geq 5$, we establish that there exists no subgroup of\n$\\mathrm{Mod}(S_g)$ that is isomorphic to $A_n \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}$, where the\n$\\mathbb{Z}$-component is generated by a power of a Dehn twist. Finally, we\nprovide a complete classification of the weak conjugacy classes of such\nsubgroups in $\\mathrm{Mod}(S_{10})$ and $\\mathrm{Mod}(S_{11})$.",

Here, we introduce a\nmaximum entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on\nconstraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and\ninterpretable representation: a set of global time processes -- an\ninhomogeneous Poisson or a Hawkes process -- and a static maximum-entropy\n(MaxEnt) edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization\nyields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree/unique-edge expectations, and yields\na whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy\nderivation of a log-linear Hawkes/NHPP intensity for temporal networks via\nfunctional optimization over path entropy, connecting inhomogeneous Poisson\nmodeling -- e.g., Hawkes models -- to MaxEnt network ensembles. Global Hawkes\ntime layers consistently improve log-likelihood over generic NHPP, while the\nMaxEnt edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected\nunique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this unified framework and\nhow it could be integrated with calibrated community/motif tools, Hawkes\ncalibration procedures, and (neural) kernel estimation.",

However, most prior work\nfocuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the\npotential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from\ncontrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt\nOptimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a\nretrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference\nprompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for\nhelpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs\ntwo complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning,\nwhere the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own\ngeneration through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive\nreasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation\ndimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By\nexplicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model\nto deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more\nrobust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2\nbenchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines.

Additionally, we propose the\nregion of origin of the emission at different wavelengths, investigate the\ncorrelation between $\\gamma$-ray and lower-energy emission, and classify\nobjects as low-, intermediate-, high- or extreme high synchrotron peaked (LSP,\nISP, HSP, E-HSP) blazars. We search for masquerading BL Lacs, a class of\nflat-spectrum radio quasars where broad emission lines are swamped by\nnon-thermal jet emission. The multi-wavelength analysis revealed that the 64\nradio-loud sources in our sample exhibit an SED with a double-peak structure,\ntypically ascribed to jet activity. Based on the synchrotron peak, 46 are HSP,\n11 as ISP, and 7 as LSP. We also found 9--18 masquerading BL Lac candidates\n($\\approx$15--30\\% of the radio-loud sample).

In this work, vulnerabilities refer to publicly\ndisclosed flaws documented in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)\nreports. Establishing a connection between attacks and vulnerabilities is\nessential for enabling timely incident response, as it provides defenders with\nimmediate, actionable insights. However, manually mapping attacks to CVEs is\ninfeasible, thereby motivating the need for automation. This paper evaluates 14\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence transformers for automatically identifying\nvulnerabilities from textual descriptions of attacks. Our results demonstrate\nthat the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieves superior\nclassification performance when using attack Technique descriptions, with an\nF1-score of 89.0, precision of 84.0, and recall of 94.7. Furthermore, it was\nobserved that, on average, 56% of the vulnerabilities identified by the MMPNet\nmodel are also represented within the CVE repository in conjunction with an\nattack, while 61% of the vulnerabilities detected by the model correspond to\nthose cataloged in the CVE repository. A manual inspection of the results\nrevealed the existence of 275 predicted links that were not documented in the\nMITRE repositories. Consequently, the automation of linking attack techniques\nto vulnerabilities not only enhances the detection and response capabilities\nrelated to software security incidents but also diminishes the duration during\nwhich vulnerabilities remain exploitable, thereby contributing to the\ndevelopment of more secure systems.",

In these works, the initial state of the process was assumed to be\nrandom i.i.d. over nodes.

In this work, we will assume that\nthe initial state of a node is an unknown function of such covariate variables.\nGiven that functions can be represented by neural networks, we will study a\nmodel where the initial state is given by a simple neural network -- notably\nthe single-layer perceptron acting on the known node-wise covariate variables.\n  Within a Bayesian framework, we study how such neural-network prior\ninformation enhances the recovery of initial states and spreading trajectories.\nWe derive a hybrid belief propagation and approximate message passing (BP-AMP)\nalgorithm that handles both the spreading dynamics and the information included\nin the node covariates, and we assess its performance against the estimators\nthat either use only the spreading information or use only the information from\nthe covariate variables.\n  We show that in some regimes, the model can exhibit first-order phase\ntransitions when using a Rademacher distribution for the neural-network\nweights.

Our approach first employs a twostep\nabstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model\nto distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create\ndiverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.\nSubsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a\ncomputationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which\nstochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and\nrobustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public\nOSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly\noutperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines.

We confirm that our mass calibration is consistent with the\neROSITA analysis by comparing masses for clusters present in both Planck and\neROSITA samples, eliminating it as a potential cause of tension.",

    "abstract": "Sulfur is known to undergo severe depletion when moving from diffuse clouds\nto the denser regimes of the interstellar medium in molecular clouds. The form\nin which sulfur gets depleted onto dust grains, however, remains a mystery. One\npossibility is that sulfur gets locked in interstellar dust in the form of\nsulfide minerals. Recently, metal sulfides such as NaS and MgS have been\ndetected in a shocked molecular cloud in the Galactic Center, suggesting that\nthese molecules could represent an important reservoir of sulfur in dust\ngrains. In this contribution, we discuss the prospect of observing metal\nsulfides such as MgS and FeS in absorption experiments carried out with the\nFIRESS instrument onboard PRIMA using its low resolution observing mode. Our\nestimates show that the molecular bands of MgS and FeS found between 20 and 50\n${\\mu}$m could be detected in absorption with S/N ${\\geq}$ 5 for sources\nbrighter than 200 mJy in just 1 h of observing time against low-mass\nprotostellar objects. This science case, therefore, has the potential to unveil\nthe main reservoir of sulfur in interstellar dust, constraining in what form\nsulfur is incorporated into minor bodies of our solar system.",

In\nparticular, we consider general weak latent factor models with $r$ signal\neigenvalues that may diverge at different rates, $N^{\\alpha _{k}}$, $0<\\alpha\n_{k}\\leq 1$, $k=1,\\dots,r$. In the existing literature, the bias has been\nderived using an approximation for the estimated factors with a specific\ndata-dependent rotation matrix $\\hat{H}$ for the model with $\\alpha_{k}=1$ for\nall $k$, whereas we derive the bias for weak factor models. In addition, we\nderive the bias using the approximation with a different rotation matrix\n$\\hat{H}_q$, which generally has a smaller bias than with $\\hat{H}$. We also\nderive the bias using our preferred approximation with a purely\nsignal-dependent rotation $H$, which is unique and can be regarded as the\npopulation version of $\\hat{H}$ and $\\hat{H}_q$. Since this bias is\nparametrically inestimable, we propose a split-panel jackknife bias correction,\nand theory shows that it successfully reduces the bias.

Significant success has been obtained in\napplying the homology of the directed flag complex to study digraphs arising as\nnetworks within numerous scientific disciplines. This homology of directed\ncliques enjoys relative ease of computation when compared to other digraph\nhomologies, making it preferable for use in applications concerning large\nnetworks. By extending the ideas of singular simplicial homology to quivers in\ncategories of different morphism types, several new singular simplicial\nhomology theories have recently been constructed.\n  Computationally efficient homologies for quivers have in general not\npreviously been seriously considered. In this paper we develop further the\nhomotopy theory of quivers necessary to derive functors that realise\nisomorphisms between the singular simplicial quiver homologies and the\nhomologies of certain spaces. The simplicial chains of these spaces arise in a\nconveniently compact form that is at least as convenient as the directed flag\ncomplex for computations.\n  Moreover, our constructions are natural with respect to the isomorphisms on\nhomology making them suitable for applications in conjunction with persistent\nhomology for practical use.

However, in rare instances, superconductivity\ncan reappear upon increasing the temperature or magnetic field, a phenomenon\nknown as reentrant superconductivity. It usually emerges from competing orders\nin strongly correlated materials. Here we demonstrate reentrant\nsuperconductivity as a function of both temperature and magnetic field, tuned\nby radio frequency (RF) power in a relatively simple system: granular aluminum\n(grAl), which exhibits the properties of a naturally occurring Josephson\njunction array. At low temperatures, giant Shapiro steps emerge, exhibiting\ncharacteristics of a single Josephson junction. Coherent phase locking across\nthe array's multiple junctions amplifies the quantized voltage, enabling\ntunability at radio frequencies, as observed in artificially designed Josephson\narrays. We show that our system can be tuned from a coherent superconducting\n(stiff-phase) to an insulating (phase-fluctuating) state using RF power. We\npropose that the RF power modulates the Josephson coupling energy, $E_J$.\nRemarkably, at elevated temperatures, the screening of the electron charge\nsuppresses the charging energy, causing superconductivity to reappear. This\nmany-body effect cannot be described within a single junction framework and\ninvolves many-body correlations. Our system can therefore be tuned to observe\nboth the single-junction regime and many-body correlation effects, serving as a\nquantum simulator for complex phenomena in condensed matter physics.",

Although it is well-known that railway demand is varying\nthroughout the day in volume and structure, the line plan is often still fixed\nthroughout the day. To better match this varying railway demand, we propose a\nmixed-integer linear programming model for multi-period line planning. This\nmodel for railway networks incorporates selection of routes, stopping patterns,\nfrequencies, transfers, and the possibility of asymmetric lines to deal with\nspatially unbalanced demand. The Epsilon-constraint method is used to determine\nPareto optimal solutions. The proposed model and solution method are tested on\na case study of part of the Dutch railway network. The results show that\nallowing for changes to the line plan during the day can reduce the total\ngeneralised journey time by up to 4.26%, especially when asymmetric lines are\nused.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly\nsharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference\nattacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data\nperturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly\nutilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and\ndiversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data\nutility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation\nand data utility remains a critical challenge.\n  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework\nfor the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on\ndata utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the\nupper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that\nperturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining\nfidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs\nlocal extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of\nindividual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted\nprivacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our\nmethod effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are\nvulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we\nachieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive\nexperimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances\nresistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in\nterms of sample quality and diversity.",

We\nposit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and\nhindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited\nor misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a\nsystematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales\n(0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum).\nWe find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter\ntuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios,\nperformed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one\noptimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer\nunfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned\nbaselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for\n1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before\nreaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two\noptimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our\nthorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon\nand Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with\nmatrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based\noptimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over\nAdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.",

Appointment rules (AR) provide medical practitioners with a simple\nyet effective tool to determine patient appointment times. Genetic programming\n(GP) can be used to evolve ARs. However, directly applying GP to design ARs may\nlead to rules that are difficult for end-users to interpret and trust. A key\nreason is that GP is unaware of the dimensional consistency, which ensures that\nthe evolved rules align with users' domain knowledge and intuitive\nunderstanding. In this paper, we develop a new dimensionally aware GP algorithm\nwith dimension repair to evolve ARs with dimensional consistency and high\nperformance. A key innovation of our method is the dimension repair procedure,\nwhich optimizes the dimensional consistency of an expression tree while\nminimizing structural changes and ensuring that its output dimension meets the\nproblem's requirements. We formulate the task as a mixed-integer linear\nprogramming model that can be efficiently solved using common mathematical\nprogramming methods. With the support of the dimension repair procedure, our\nmethod can explore a wider range of AR structures by temporarily breaking the\ndimensional consistency of individuals, and then restoring it without altering\ntheir overall structure, thereby identifying individuals with greater potential\nadvantages. We evaluated the proposed method in a comprehensive set of\nsimulated clinics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach\nmanaged to evolve high-quality ARs that significantly outperform not only the\nmanually designed ARs but also existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP\nmethods in terms of both objective values and dimensional consistency. In\naddition, we analyzed the semantics of the evolved ARs, providing insight into\nthe design of more effective and interpretable ARs.",

Object-centric learning aims\nto mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot\nattention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and\nhas been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot\nattention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic\ninformation. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on\nlow-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly\nsensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object\ncontours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to\nfine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space\nthroughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the\nflexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,\nboth of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.\nIn the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground\nand background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional\ncontextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level\nfeatures. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the\noriginal reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a\nfeature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation.

    "abstract": "Our objective is to demonstrate the global existence of classical solutions\nfor the nonlinear irrotational Euler-Nordstroem system, which includes a linear\nequation of state and a cosmological constant. In this framework, the\ngravitational field is represented by a single scalar function that satisfies a\nspecific semi-linear wave equation. We focus on spatially periodic deviations\nfrom the background metric, which is why we study the semi-linear wave equation\non the three-dimensional torus $\\mathbb{T}^3$ within the Sobolev spaces\n$H^m(\\mathbb{T}^3)$. This work is divided into two parts. First, we examine the\nNordstroem equation with a source term generated by an irrotational fluid\ngoverned by a linear equation of state. In the second part, we analyze the full\ncoupled system. One reason for this separation is that an irrotational fluid\nwith a linear equation of state introduces a source term for the Nordstroem\nequation containing a nonlinear term of fractional order. This nonlinearity\nprecludes the direct application of the techniques used in our earlier work\n\\cite{Brauer_Karp_23}, where we relied on symmetric hyperbolic systems, energy\nestimates, and homogeneous Sobolev spaces. Instead, we develop an appropriate\nenergy functional and establish the corresponding energy estimates tailored to\nthe wave equation under consideration.",

We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility\nof BioMD on the DD-13M (ligand unbinding) and MISATO datasets.

We\nintroduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet\nmodel deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When\ntrained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for\ncrying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency\nsuitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a\ncritical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and\ndiagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures\n(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational\ncost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates\nthree key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%\nreduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT\ncommunication for clinical alerts.

Using a curated \\textit{Diagnostic Prompt Suite} and an\ninnovative, automated evaluation pipeline where a powerful LLM acts as an\nimpartial judge, we analyze eighteen models across capability tiers.

We further document a cross-model default persona clustering\n(ISTJ/ESTJ) that likely reflects common alignment incentives. Taken together,\nthis suggests that a model's interactive nature is not an emergent property of\nits scale or reasoning power, but a direct consequence of specific, and highly\nvariable, developer alignment strategies.

Recently, the\npowerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have driven their\nadoption in SR.

These issues dampen the model scalability and lead\nto suboptimal recommendation performance. Therefore, based on LLMs like\nLlama3-8B-instruct, we introduce a novel SR framework named MME-SID, which\nintegrates multimodal embeddings and quantized embeddings to mitigate embedding\ncollapse. Additionally, we propose a Multimodal Residual Quantized Variational\nAutoencoder (MM-RQ-VAE) with maximum mean discrepancy as the reconstruction\nloss and contrastive learning for alignment, which effectively preserve\nintra-modal distance information and capture inter-modal correlations,\nrespectively. To further alleviate catastrophic forgetting, we initialize the\nmodel with the trained multimodal code embeddings. Finally, we fine-tune the\nLLM efficiently using LoRA in a multimodal frequency-aware fusion manner.\nExtensive experiments on three public datasets validate the superior\nperformance of MME-SID thanks to its capability to mitigate embedding collapse\nand catastrophic forgetting.

The growth of lithium\ndendrites in the electrolyte not only reduces the Coulombic efficiency of the\nbattery but also poses a risk of puncturing the electrolyte, leading to\ninternal short circuits between the anode and cathode. This study is to solve\nthe problem of lithium dendrite growth in solid-state lithium batteries by\nemploying phase-field theory for numerical simulations. A phase-field model is\ndeveloped by coupling the mechanical stress field, thermal field, and\nelectrochemical field, to investigate the morphology and evolution of lithium\ndendrites under the condition of different ambient temperatures, external\npressures, and their combined effects. The results indicate that higher\ntemperature and greater external pressure significantly suppress lithium\ndendrite growth, leading to fewer side branches, smoother surfaces, and more\nuniform electrochemical deposition. Increased external pressure inhibits\nlongitudinal dendrite growth, resulting in a compressed morphology with higher\ncompactness, but at the cost of increased mechanical instability. The combined\neffect of temperature and pressure exhibits a pronounced inhibitory influence\non dendrite growth, with stress concentrating at the dendrite roots.

To support real-time performance, we first apply an intensity\nthreshold mask to quickly suppress dense snowflake clusters near the LiDAR, and\nthen perform multi-modal feature fusion to refine the point-wise weight\nprediction, improving overall robustness under adverse weather. Our model is\ntrained in clear weather conditions and rigorously tested across various\nscenarios, including snowy and dynamic. Extensive experimental results confirm\nthe effectiveness of our method, demonstrating robust performance in both clear\nand snowy weather. This advancement enhances the model's generalizability and\npaves the way for more reliable autonomous systems capable of operating across\na wider range of environmental conditions.",

Existing fairness\nevaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use\nsimplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms.\nThis also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert,\ndefaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our\ncontributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale,\ncontrolled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from\nMIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and\nthree context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework -\nMulti-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness\nfor three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and\nLatent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated\nFairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs\nbetween fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four\nopen-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and\ntheir finetuned versions under quantization and context variations.

A recent\nstudy addresses this issue by introducing an augmented shuffle DP protocol,\nwhere users do not add noise and the shuffler performs random sampling and\ndummy data addition. However, it focuses on frequency estimation over\ncategorical data with a small domain and cannot be applied to a large domain\ndue to prohibitively high communication and computational costs.\n  In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing a novel augmented shuffle DP\nprotocol called the FME (Filtering-with-Multiple-Encryption) protocol. Our FME\nprotocol uses a hash function to filter out unpopular items and then accurately\ncalculates frequencies for popular items. To perform this within one round of\ninteraction between users and the shuffler, our protocol carefully communicates\nwithin a system using multiple encryption. We also apply our FME protocol to\nmore advanced KV (Key-Value) statistics estimation with an additional technique\nto reduce bias.

Future order distribution information, which reflects the\ndistribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the\nperformance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize\nspatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution\ninformation from serious time slices. However, learning future order\ndistribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem\nwith strong randomness.

The\nmain contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global\ngraphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional\nlong time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An\ninnovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph\nlearning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to\nextract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust\nfuture graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure\nforecasting outcomes.

    "abstract": "Effective human-robot interaction (HRI) in multi-object teleoperation tasks\nfaces significant challenges due to perceptual ambiguities in virtual reality\n(VR) environments and the limitations of single-modality intention recognition.\nThis paper proposes a shared control framework that combines a virtual\nadmittance (VA) model with a Multimodal-CNN-based Human Intention Perception\nNetwork (MMIPN) to enhance teleoperation performance and user experience. The\nVA model employs artificial potential fields to guide operators toward target\nobjects by adjusting admittance force and optimizing motion trajectories. MMIPN\nprocesses multimodal inputs, including gaze movement, robot motions, and\nenvironmental context, to estimate human grasping intentions, helping to\novercome depth perception challenges in VR. Our user study evaluated four\nconditions across two factors, and the results showed that MMIPN significantly\nimproved grasp success rates, while the VA model enhanced movement efficiency\nby reducing path lengths. Gaze data emerged as the most crucial input modality.\nThese findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal cues with\nimplicit guidance in VR-based teleoperation, providing a robust solution for\nmulti-object grasping tasks and enabling more natural interactions across\nvarious applications in the future.",

Recently, this\nduality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by\npredictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the\nneocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on\nauto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic\ncapabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory.

The understanding module primarily functions as a\ntranslator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the\ngeneration module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring\nthe original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the\nnew content.

Almost global asymptotic stability and local exponential\nstability are demonstrated using a Lyapunov analysis.

While low contrarian densities are insufficient to overturn the\nbias, higher values of $\\alpha$ systematically drive the system closer to a\nbalanced coexistence of opinions, though exact parity is prevented by the\npresence of bias $p$. We further analyze the temporal relaxation of opinions\nand extract the characteristic timescales of convergence. Our findings\nhighlight how contrarians, acting as structured non-conformists, can suppress\nconsensus and maintain opinion diversity, while internal biases ultimately\nhinder a perfectly even split.",

    "abstract": "Time-reversal symmetry plays an essential role in the thermodynamic\nuncertainty relation, which bound the fluctuations of observables in terms of\nthe associated dissipation. In fact, thermodynamic uncertainty relations are\ntypically derived under the assumption that the observable of interest is\nantisymmetric under time reversal. This also suggests that existing\nthermodynamic uncertainty relations are restricted to a limited class of\nobservables. In this paper, we mitigate this restriction by introducing a new\nclass of observables that do not exhibit the exact antisymmetry but only change\nthe sign under time reversal. We call it generalized time reversal and derive a\nbroadly applicable thermodynamic uncertainty relation for observables with this\ncondition. The generalization is achieved by direct statistical arguments on\nthe probability distributions of dissipation and the observable, and holds for\nboth deterministic and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the derived\nthermodynamic uncertainty relation in a quantum refrigeration model, showing\nthat the precision of generalized observables remains expressible in terms of\nthe heat-dissipation cost. The result extends the scope of thermodynamic\nuncertainty relations beyond what was reached by frameworks relying on strong\nsymmetries imposed by fluctuation theorems.",

Existing methods often suffer from\nidentity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how\ndifferent subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We\npresent MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject\ngeneration through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature\ndisentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires\nprecise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which\nregions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.\nTo enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset\nproviding fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference\nsubjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on\nthis foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to\nenforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency\nfrom each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the\nmulti-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal\nattention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving\nindividual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nMOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,\nwhile existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains\nhigh fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex\nmulti-subject synthesis applications.",

The sequential ordinal model\nlikelihood is equivalent to a binary model conditional on unknown regression\ncoefficients and spatio-temporal random effects. Therefore, estimation and\nprediction in the space-time context can proceed using the well-established\ndynamic generalised linear model framework. Moreover, the sequential ordinal\nmodel avoids the ordering constraints on the threshold parameters that\ndetermine the category break points required by cumulative ordinal models, and\nso simplifies the estimation procedure for high-dimensional space-time\napplications using Bayesian inference. The dynamic spatio-temporal sequential\nordinal model is applied to estimate foliage cover abundance of four actively\nmanaged invasive alien species. These invasive weed species are observed by\nmeans of a modified Braun-Blanquet score that is commonly used in vegetation\nstudies and constitutes ordinal data. The multivariate ordinal data for the\nmanaged weeds species are sparsely distributed in space and time with few\nobservations recorded in high foliage cover categories. A separable model for\nspace-time dependence that maintains parameter interpretability in the presence\nof aggregated ordinal categories is therefore developed. Estimation and\nprediction is demonstrated using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA)\nmethods developed for univariate spatio-temporal models. Bayesian estimation\nand prediction shows that the four invasive weed species differentially respond\nto habitat type, control effort and accessibility, and share similar magnitudes\nof dependence with short effective spatial ranges and strong temporal\nautocorrelations.",

The mean logarithmic\nmass shows a nonmonotonic change with energy, a feature observed for the first\ntime. In this work, we present a new approach to describe the mechanisms of\nformation of this feature. The key elements of this approach are the\nnon-classical diffusion model of cosmic rays developed by the authors in which\nthe knee in the observed spectrum occurs naturally without the use of\nadditional assumptions, as well as power-law asymptotics before and after the\nknee, and a soft spectrum of particle generation in cosmic ray source. To\nobtain a more complete picture of the spectrum formation in the region of the\nknee and the sources that form it, we carried out calculations of the spectra\nof the main groups of nuclei in the energy range of 1 TeV-100 PeV. It is shown\nthat the behavior of the all-particle spectrum and mass composition in the knee\nregion is determined by local pevatrons located at a distance of 750-900 pc\nfrom the Earth. The energy of the knee practically coincides with the knees in\nthe spectra of protons and helium nuclei. The contribution of the light\ncomponents $p$+He is about 70%, the CNO group provides $\\sim$13%. The energy\nspectrum index of the light components is -2.61 before the knee.

We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key\ndesign choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction\nmethods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for\nrobust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard\nsequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence\nlengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and\nbenchmarking framework.",

    "abstract": "Computation-Enabled Object Storage (COS) systems, such as MinIO and Ceph,\nhave recently emerged as promising storage solutions for post hoc, SQL-based\nanalysis on large-scale datasets in High-Performance Computing (HPC)\nenvironments. By supporting object-granular layouts, COS facilitates\ncolumn-oriented access and supports in-storage execution of data reduction\noperators, such as filters, close to where the data resides. Despite growing\ninterest and adoption, existing COS systems exhibit several fundamental\nlimitations that hinder their effectiveness. First, they impose rigid\nconstraints on output data formats, limiting flexibility and interoperability.\nSecond, they support offloading for only a narrow set of operators and\nexpressions, restricting their applicability to more complex analytical tasks.\nThird--and perhaps most critically--they fail to incorporate design strategies\nthat enable compute offloading optimized for the characteristics of deep\nstorage hierarchies. To address these challenges, this paper proposes OASIS, a\nnovel COS system that features: (i) flexible and interoperable output delivery\nthrough diverse formats, including columnar layouts such as Arrow; (ii) broad\nsupport for complex operators (e.g., aggregate, sort) and array-aware\nexpressions, including element-wise predicates over array structures; and (iii)\ndynamic selection of optimal execution paths across internal storage layers,\nguided by operator characteristics and data movement costs.

We propose the\nfirst image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes\nincomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and\nreconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The\ncontinuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence\nin the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a\npatch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates\ninference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a\npretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally\nrobust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide\nsemantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content\nremains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene.

By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple\ncomponents rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed\npreference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to\nlearn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be\npublicly released soon.",

Publishing activity showed consistent weekday effects: in the\nfirst window, average views peaked on Mondays at 92,658; in the second, on\nWednesdays at 115,479; and in the third, on Fridays at 84,874, reflecting a\nshift in audience attention toward mid- and late week.

Frequency\nanalysis revealed sharp spikes, with COVID appearing in 799 video titles in\nAugust 2024, while engagement analysis showed that videos titled with shorts\nattracted very high views, peaking at 2.16 million average views per video in\nJune 2023. Analysis of sentiment of video descriptions in English showed weak\ncorrelation with views in the raw data (Pearson r = 0.0154, p = 0.2987), but\nstronger correlations emerged once outliers were addressed, with Spearman r =\n0.110 (p < 0.001) and Pearson r = 0.0925 (p < 0.001). Category-level analysis\nof video durations revealed contrasting outcomes: long videos focusing on\npeople and blogs averaged 209,114 views, short entertainment videos averaged\n288,675 views, and medium-to-long news and politics videos averaged 51,309 and\n59,226 views, respectively.

We build upon propagation-invariant space-time wave packets\n(STWPs), in which each spatial frequency is associated with a single\nwavelength. A linear tilt in the propagation path of an STWP is produced by a\ncorresponding tilt in the spectral domain. A curved trajectory is then produced\nthrough locally changing the tilt direction along the propagation axis, which\nrequires associating a prescribed finite-bandwidth spatial spectrum to each\nwavelength. Using this approach, we realize symmetric STWPs traveling along\ncurved trajectories that follow linear, quadratic, cubic, or even square-root\npower laws with an acceleration rate that is independent of the beam spatial\nscale.

    "abstract": "Speech Recognition has seen a dramatic shift towards adopting Large Language\nModels (LLMs). This shift is partly driven by good scalability properties\ndemonstrated by LLMs, ability to leverage large amounts of labelled, unlabelled\nspeech and text data, streaming capabilities with auto-regressive framework and\nmulti-tasking with instruction following characteristics of LLMs. However,\nsimple next-token prediction objective, typically employed with LLMs, have\ncertain limitations in performance and challenges with hallucinations. In this\npaper, we propose application of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to\nenable reinforcement learning from human feedback for automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR). We design simple rule based reward functions to guide the\npolicy updates. We demonstrate significant improvements in word error rate\n(upto 18.4% relative), reduction in hallucinations, increased robustness on\nout-of-domain datasets and effectiveness in domain adaptation.",

To address the\nlack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a\nblack-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given\nan ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset\nof scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's\nalignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges\nthe outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are\naggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a\nweighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground\ntruth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges\nmay disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether\nEigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that\nmost of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual\nquantifies the disposition of the model itself.",

This approach not only enhances spectrum utilization but also generates\nfriendly interference to complicate a warden's surveillance or an\neavesdropper's decoding efforts. From a covertness perspective, we derive exact\nclosed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) under\narbitrary judgment thresholds.

Although there is no direct observational\nevidence to definitively determine the formation pathways of SNe Ia, studying\nthe physical properties of DWDs provides valuable insights into their\nevolutionary processes, interaction modes, and merger mechanisms, which are\nessential for understanding the explosion mechanisms of SNe Ia. This study aims\nto identify DWD candidates through spectroscopic radial velocity measurements\nand analyze their physical properties based on DESI EDR. We crossmatched DESI\nEDR with the Gaia EDR3 to select DA. We measured the spectroscopic RV using the\ncross-correlation function and assessed the significance of RV variability\nusing a chi-squared-based variability method. Spectroscopic Teff and log g were\nderived by fitting the hydrogen Balmer lines, with 3D convection corrections\napplied. Orbital periods and semi-amplitudes were obtained through a\nLomb-Scargle analysis of the RV time series. We interpolated WD cooling models\nand applied Monte Carlo simulations to calculate masses, cooling ages, radii,\nand their associated uncertainties. We also analyzed their photometric and\nspectral energy distribution properties to derive photometric temperatures and\nradii, which were then compared with the corresponding spectroscopic\nparameters. We identified 33 DA DWD candidates with significant RV variability,\nincluding 28 new discoveries. Among them, we found an extremely low-mass DWD\ncandidate and a potential triple system. For these candidates, we measured key\nphysical parameters including Teff, log g, mass, and radius, and estimated the\norbital periods based on the available data. Of these, 17 candidates exhibit\nrelatively clear periodic RV variability in the current data, and we report\ntheir best-fitting periods and RV semi-amplitudes.",

Unlike\ntraditional RMABs, the correlation among sources introduces a unique challenge:\nthe penalty function of each source depends on the AoI of other correlated\nsources, preventing decomposition of the problem into multiple independent\nMarkov Decision Processes (MDPs), a key step in applying traditional RMAB\nsolutions. To address this, we propose a novel approach by approximating the\npenalty function of each source and establish an analytical bound on the\napproximation error. We then develop scheduling policies for two scenarios: (i)\nfull knowledge of the penalty functions and (ii) no knowledge of the penalty\nfunctions. For the case of known penalty functions, we present an upper bound\non the optimality gap of our policy in the asymptotic regime. For the case of\nunknown penalty functions and signal distributions, we develop an online\nlearning approach that utilizes bandit feedback to learn an online Maximum Gain\nFirst (MGF) policy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed policies in minimizing inference error and achieving scalability in\nthe number of sources.",

    "abstract": "We construct a time-like Janus solution, which is mediated by a\ntime-dependent dilaton field in asymptotic AdS spacetime. This solution breaks\nthe null energy condition, but we argue that it is nevertheless useful as a toy\nmodel of holographic global quantum quench. The dual CFT is given by conformal\nperturbation theory, where the primary scalar operator that is dual to the bulk\ndilaton field is coupled with a global-quench-type time-dependent source. We\ncompute one-point functions of the scalar operator and the stress-energy\ntensor, and confirm that the results are consistent with the proposed CFT\npicture. We also evaluate the holographic entanglement entropy for late time\nafter the global quench, and show that the result agrees with the CFT\ncomputation. The stability of the time-like Janus solution against a scalar\nperturbation is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Sequential decision-making is central to sustainable agricultural management\nand precision agriculture, where resource inputs must be optimized under\nuncertainty and over time. However, such decisions must often be made with\nlimited observations, whereas classical bandit and reinforcement learning\napproaches typically rely on either linear or black-box reward models that may\nmisrepresent domain knowledge or require large amounts of data. We propose a\nfamily of nonlinear, model-based bandit algorithms that embed domain-specific\nresponse curves directly into the exploration-exploitation loop. By coupling\n(i) principled uncertainty quantification with (ii) closed-form or rapidly\ncomputable profit optima, these algorithms achieve sublinear regret and\nnear-optimal sample complexity while preserving interpretability. Theoretical\nanalysis establishes regret and sample complexity bounds, and extensive\nsimulations emulating real-world fertilizer-rate decisions show consistent\nimprovements over both linear and nonparametric baselines (such as linear UCB\nand $k$-NN UCB) in the low-sample regime, under both well-specified and\nshape-compatible misspecified models. Because our approach leverages\nmechanistic insight rather than large data volumes, it is especially suited to\nresource-constrained settings, supporting sustainable, inclusive, and\ntransparent sequential decision-making across agriculture, environmental\nmanagement, and allied applications. This methodology directly contributes to\nSDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by\nenabling data-driven, less wasteful agricultural practices.",

Frequency-domain indicators of autonomic\nnervous system activity were obtained through Power Spectral Density (PSD)\nanalysis and utilized as input for machine learning models including Decision\nTree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. In addition, deep\nlearning approaches, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, were directly applied to the raw ECG\nsignals. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of ensemble-based\nclassifiers, with CatBoost achieving 90% accuracy. Moreover, the LSTM model\nprovided superior results, attaining 94% accuracy with balanced precision,\nrecall, and F1-score, reflecting its strength in modeling temporal dependencies\nin ECG data. Overall, the findings suggest that integrating frequency-domain\nfeature extraction with advanced learning algorithms enhances stress prediction\nand paves the way for real-time healthcare monitoring solutions.",

In this paper, we formulate a classical interaction\npicture which serves as the foundation of the classical eikonal. Our emphasis\nis on generality. In perturbation theories, both Hamiltonian deformation and\nsymplectic deformation are considered. Particles and fields are treated on a\nsimilar footing. The causality prescription of the propagator is essentially\nthe same for non-relativistic and relativistic kinematics. For a probe particle\nin electromagnetic or gravitational background, we present all order formulas\nfor the perturbative eikonal.

While recent work\nhas explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches\nsuffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance\nfidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur\nexcessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over\nthe tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address\nthese gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous\nonline reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration\nwith substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment\npreparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end\nlatency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single\nparameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or\nany point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks\ndemonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless\nacceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to\n60%.

Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on\nnew data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows\nfor effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen\ndatasets without fine-tuning.

We conducted a quantitative comparison using an\nInitiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis\n(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to\ntheir AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and\ngeneral feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a\nfundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more\ncognitively guided and diverse, centered around a \"question-factual\nresponse-feedback\" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and\nstudent-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of\nstructural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an\n\"explanation-simplistic response\" loop that is essentially a simple information\ntransfer between the teacher and student.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing has garnered significant interest for its potential to\nachieve exponential speedups over classical approaches. However, in the Noisy\nIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, quantum circuit scalability remains\nlimited by gate fidelity and qubit counts, restricting physical implementations\nto small-scale circuits. While prior work has explored logic network structures\nfor quantum circuit synthesis, these methods often neglect the spatial\nstructure intrinsic to Boolean functions. In this paper, we leverage this\nspatial structure, encoded by parallelotopes embedded in the hypercube defined\nby the Boolean function, to access a broader optimization space, enhancing\nsynthesis efficiency and reducing circuit complexity. We propose the Spatial\nStructure-based Hypercube Reduction~(SSHR), a novel synthesis method tailored\nfor small-scale Boolean functions ($\\leq 8$). SSHR extracts global spatial\nfeatures to minimize the use of Multi-Control Toffoli (MCT) gates. To further\nexploit spatial correlations, we introduce two variants: SSHR-H employs\nheuristic functions to accelerate synthesis runtime, while SSHR-I integrates an\nInteger Linear Programming (ILP) solver to maximize spatial structure\nutilization. Our approach outperforms existing techniques in small-scale\ncircuit synthesis, achieving 56\\% and 81\\% reductions in CNOT gate counts\ncompared to the Exclusive Sum-of-Products (ESOP) and Xor-And-Inverter Graph\n(XAG) methods, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent\nharmful content generation.

However, in real-world settings, risks also come\nfrom non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,\nself-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly\ninfluence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,\nescalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce\nConstructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects\nagainst malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe\nand helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic\nanticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and\ninterpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.\nOy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high\ngeneral capabilities.

To better embody the distinctiveness of materials crafted via\ninnovative heterostructuring, here we introduce the concept of \"structural\ngradient hardening\" (SGH), which captures an essential feature of HS materials\nand complements traditional strengthening mechanisms.

The phase evolution of the beamformed signal is then\nextracted to infer water level changes. To address clock asynchronism between\nthe transmitter and receiver inherent in bistatic systems, we introduce a\nbeamforming-based compensation technique for removing time-varying random phase\noffsets in CSI.

    "abstract": "Random Linear Streaming Codes (RLSCs) can dramatically reduce the queuing\ndelay of block codes in real-time services. In this paper, we aim to explore\nthe fundamental limit of large-field-size RLSCs in stochastic symbol erasure\nchannels (SEC). The Non-systematic RLSCs (NRLSCs) in i.i.d. SEC has been\nanalyzed in [Pinwen Su et al. 2022]. In this work, we first derive the\nclosed-form expression on the exact error probability of NRLSCs in\nGilbert-Elliott symbol erasure channels (G-ESEC). Compared to i.i.d SEC, the\nerasure probability of G-ESEC depends on channel state, thus transitions\nbetween the states should be considered. To deal with the stochastic state\ntransitions, we introduce two novel techniques. (i) To account for the impact\nof switching states on probability terms, we find and leverage the recursive\nstructure of the state transition traces. (ii) To obtain the expected number of\nerror timeslots, we derive the stationary initial distribution of the states,\nand formulate iterative equation to characterize the expectation terms. Then we\nanalyze the Systematic RLSCs (SRLSCs) in a special SEC, i.e., the packet\nerasure channel (PEC). In this scenario, SRLSCs could save some source symbols\nwhich should have exceeded the decoding delay in NRLSCs, and thus could\nsignificantly reduce the error probability. To this point, our contributions\nare two-folds. (i) Through a case study, we find a counter-intuitive phenomenon\nthat SRLSCs can cause unexpected error events comparing to NRLSCs in some\nerasure patterns. Then we fully characterize the error event of SRLSCs for any\nerasure pattern. (ii) For i.i.d. PEC, we derive an analytical expression on\nexact error probability of SRLSCs when length of memory approaches infinity and\ncoding rate equals to 1/2. Simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of\nour analysis and compare the performance of NRLSCs, SRLSCs, and existing\nstreaming codes.",

    "abstract": "Modern data center workloads are composed of multiserver jobs, computational\njobs that require multiple CPU cores in order to run. A data center server can\nrun many multiserver jobs in parallel, as long as it has sufficient resources\nto meet their demands. However, multiserver jobs are generally stateful,\nmeaning that job preemptions incur significant overhead from saving and\nreloading the state associated with running jobs. Hence, most systems try to\navoid these costly job preemptions altogether. Given these constraints, a\nscheduling policy must determine what set of jobs to run in parallel at each\nmoment in time to minimize the mean response time across a stream of arriving\njobs. Unfortunately, simple non-preemptive policies such as FCFS may leave many\ncores idle, resulting in high mean response times or even system instability.\nOur goal is to design and analyze non-preemptive scheduling policies for\nmultiserver jobs that maintain high system utilization to achieve low mean\nresponse time.\n  One well-known non-preemptive policy, Most Servers First (MSF), prioritizes\njobs with higher core requirements and achieves high resource utilization.\nHowever, MSF causes extreme variability in job waiting times, and can perform\nsignificantly worse than FCFS in practice. To address this, we propose and\nanalyze a class of scheduling policies called MSF-Quick Swap (MSFQ) that\nperforms well. MSFQ reduces the variability of job waiting times by\nperiodically granting priority to other jobs in the system. We provide both\nstability results and an analysis of mean response time under MSFQ to prove\nthat our policy dramatically outperforms MSF in the case where jobs request one\ncore or all the cores. In more complex cases, we evaluate MSFQ in simulation.\nWe show that, with some additional optimization, variants of the MSFQ policy\ncan greatly outperform MSF and FCFS on real-world multiserver job workloads.",

Quantum\nlow-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes are one of the most promising quantum\nerror correction (QEC) methods due to their high encoding rates. Belief\nPropagation-Ordered Statistics Decoding (BP-OSD) is the state-of-the-art\ndecoder for QLDPC codes, but it suffers from high decoding latency.

In contrast, for y > 50, both MM and\nSNR are too small to allow effective model discrimination in these cases.\nParameter estimation further indicates that for y < 50, the degeneracy between\nthe luminosity distance and MLz can be effectively broken. Although the Bayes\nfactor decreases as zs increases, lensing signatures remain identifiable up to\nzs = 6. The role of Ms depends on the overlap of the GW signal with the\ndetector sensitive band.

To\ninvestigate the particle acceleration condition in the hot spots, it is of\nprime importance to evaluate their magnetic field strength.

In such settings, traditional positioning techniques\nrelying on line-of-sight (LoS) or cooperative signaling fail due to severe\nmultipath propagation and unknown transmit power. This paper proposes a novel\ngenerative inference framework for NLoS localization based on conditional\ndiffusion models. By leveraging the physical insight that diffracted\nelectromagnetic energy concentrates near building edges, we develop a sampling\nstrategy that collects sparse received signal strength (RSS) measurements at\nthe geometric vertices of obstacles--locations that maximize Fisher information\nand mutual information with respect to the unknown source. To overcome the lack\nof known transmission power, we normalize all sampled RSS values relative to\nthe maximum observed intensity, enabling the construction of a power-invariant\nradio map (RM). A conditional diffusion model is trained to reconstruct the\nfull RM based on environmental layout and sparse RSS observations. Localization\nis then achieved by identifying the brightest point on the generated RM.\nMoreover, the proposed framework is compatible with existing RSS-based\nlocalization algorithms, enabling a dual-driven paradigm that fuses physical\nknowledge and data-driven inference for improved accuracy. Extensive\ntheoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that our approach\nachieves high localization accuracy with significantly reduced sampling cost,\noffering a scalable and physically grounded solution for non-cooperative NLoS\nemitter localization.",

Alternatively, scanning\nthe x-ray probe along a continuous path, called a fly-scan, reduces scan time\nand increases scan efficiency. However, not all regions of an image are equally\nimportant. Currently used fly-scan methods do not adapt to the characteristics\nof the sample during the scan, often wasting time in uniform, uninteresting\nregions. One approach to avoid unnecessary scanning in uniform regions for\nraster step-scans is to use deep learning techniques to select a shorter\noptimal scan path instead of a traditional raster scan path, followed by\nreconstructing the entire image from the partially scanned data. However, this\napproach heavily depends on the quality of the initial sampling, requires a\nlarge dataset for training, and incurs high computational costs. We propose\nleveraging the fly-scan method along an optimal scanning path, focusing on\nregions of interest (ROIs) and using image completion techniques to reconstruct\ndetails in non-scanned areas. This approach further shortens the scanning\nprocess and potentially decreases x-ray exposure dose while maintaining\nhigh-quality and detailed information in critical regions. To achieve this, we\nintroduce a multi-iteration fly-scan framework that adapts to the scanned\nimage. Specifically, in each iteration, we define two key functions: (1) a\nscore function to generate initial anchor points and identify potential ROIs,\nand (2) an objective function to optimize the anchor points for convergence to\nan optimal set. Using these anchor points, we compute the shortest scanning\npath between optimized anchor points, perform the fly-scan, and subsequently\napply image completion based on the acquired information in preparation for the\nnext scan iteration.",

    "abstract": "We present a construction of a Jordan scheme from an elementary abelian\n$2$-group of rank $n$ and a $\\{1,-1\\}$-matrix of order $2^n$ that satisfies a\nspecified condition. We then prove that the orders of matrices with the\nspecified condition are limited to $2, 4$ or $8$. Using these matrices, we\nconstruct essentially two new proper Jordan schemes of orders $16$ and $32$.\nFinally, we analyze the structures of the real adjacency Jordan algebras of\nthese Jordan schemes and prove that they are the first known examples whose\nreal adjacency Jordan algebras admit simple components of type $\\mathbb{R}\n\\oplus_f \\mathbb{R}^n$, namely non-Hermitian type.",
