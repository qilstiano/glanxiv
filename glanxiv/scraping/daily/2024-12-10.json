    "abstract": "This paper addresses hypothesis testing for the mean of matrix-valued data in\nhigh-dimensional settings. We investigate the minimum discrepancy test,\noriginally proposed by Cragg (1997), which serves as a rank test for\nlower-dimensional matrices. We evaluate the performance of this test as the\nmatrix dimensions increase proportionally with the sample size, and identify\nits limitations when matrix dimensions significantly exceed the sample size. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a new test statistic tailored for\nhigh-dimensional matrix rank testing. The oracle version of this statistic is\nanalyzed to highlight its theoretical properties. Additionally, we develop a\nnovel approach for constructing a sparse singular value decomposition (SVD)\nestimator for singular vectors, providing a comprehensive examination of its\ntheoretical aspects. Using the sparse SVD estimator, we explore the properties\nof the sample version of our proposed statistic. The paper concludes with\nsimulation studies and two case studies involving surveillance video data,\ndemonstrating the practical utility of our proposed methods.",

We describe and\nevaluate here a provenance approach for dealing with negation, based on\nquotient semirings of polynomials with dual indeterminates. This not only\nprovides a semiring provenance analysis for full first-order logic (and other\nlogics and query languages with negation) but also permits a reverse provenance\nanalysis, i.e., finding models that satisfy various properties under given\nprovenance tracking assumptions.

A contemporary method, known as Planning with Perspectives\n(PWP), addresses these challenges through the use of perspectives and set\noperations for knowledge. The JP model defines that an agent's belief is\njustified if and only if the agent has seen evidence that this belief was true\nin the past and has not seen evidence to suggest that this has changed.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models often struggle with generalization when deploying on\nreal-world data, due to the common distributional shift to the training data.\nTest-time adaptation (TTA) is an emerging scheme used at inference time to\naddress this issue. In TTA, models are adapted online at the same time when\nmaking predictions to test data. Neighbor-based approaches have gained\nattention recently, where prototype embeddings provide location information to\nalleviate the feature shift between training and testing data. However, due to\ntheir inherit limitation of simplicity, they often struggle to learn useful\npatterns and encounter performance degradation. To confront this challenge, we\nstudy the TTA problem from a geometric point of view. We first reveal that the\nunderlying structure of neighbor-based methods aligns with the Voronoi Diagram,\na classical computational geometry model for space partitioning. Building on\nthis observation, we propose the Test-Time adjustment by Voronoi Diagram\nguidance (TTVD), a novel framework that leverages the benefits of this\ngeometric property. Specifically, we explore two key structures: 1)\nCluster-induced Voronoi Diagram (CIVD): This integrates the joint contribution\nof self-supervision and entropy-based methods to provide richer information. 2)\nPower Diagram (PD): A generalized version of the Voronoi Diagram that refines\npartitions by assigning weights to each Voronoi cell. Our experiments under\nrigid, peer-reviewed settings on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, ImageNet-C, and\nImageNet-R shows that TTVD achieves remarkable improvements compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experimental results also explore\nthe effects of batch size and class imbalance, which are two scenarios commonly\nencountered in real-world applications.

Inspired by SogCLR's\nefficiency and adaptability, we introduce AmCLR and xAmCLR objective functions\ntailored for bimodal vision-language models to further enhance the robustness\nof contrastive learning. AmCLR integrates diverse augmentations, including text\nparaphrasing and image transformations, to reinforce the alignment of\ncontrastive representations, keeping batch size limited to a few hundred\nsamples unlike CLIP which needs batch size of 32,768 to produce reasonable\nresults. xAmCLR further extends this paradigm by incorporating intra-modal\nalignments between original and augmented modalities for richer feature\nlearning.

    "abstract": "The Virtual Observatory (VO) is a global ecosystem of interoperating services\nthat connect worldwide data archives. The VO is implemented in all major\nastronomy archives through common interfaces developed by the 22 members of the\nInternational Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA). It was founded in 2002, and\nthe newest members, the SKA Observatory and the Kazakhstan Virtual Observatory,\njoined in 2022. The VO offers access to data on FAIR principles and from its\ninception has supported Open Science. The VO acts as a democratizing influence\nin astronomy: it provides equal access to worldwide public data sets to\nunderserved communities as well as to large data centers, and it enables\ninternational participation in scientific research and education. Thus,\nastronomers from many different communities are positioned to participate in\nthe big science questions emerging in astronomy in the 2020s, such as\ninterpreting transient sources that will be measured in forthcoming missions\nsuch as Rubin. In addition, the IVOA has signed an MoU with the IAU Office of\nAstronomy for Development (OAD). Under this MoU, IVOA members participated in\n\"Astronomy from Archival Data,\" which involved educational activities for\nundergraduate and post-graduate students organized by Dr. Priya Hasan. The IVOA\nplans to participate in future such educational events. The presentation\ndescribes how new communities may participate in Virtual Observatory science\nand educational activities, including practices for developing VO-compliant\ndata centers and archives and education and training for developers and end\nusers.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the training of a two-layer autoencoder used to parameterize a\nflow-based generative model for sampling from a high-dimensional Gaussian\nmixture. Previous work shows that the phase where the relative probability\nbetween the modes is learned disappears as the dimension goes to infinity\nwithout an appropriate time schedule. We introduce a time dilation that solves\nthis problem. This enables us to characterize the learned velocity field,\nfinding a first phase where the probability of each mode is learned and a\nsecond phase where the variance of each mode is learned. We find that the\nautoencoder representing the velocity field learns to simplify by estimating\nonly the parameters relevant to each phase. Turning to real data, we propose a\nmethod that, for a given feature, finds intervals of time where training\nimproves accuracy the most on that feature. Since practitioners take a uniform\ndistribution over training times, our method enables more efficient training.\nWe provide preliminary experiments validating this approach.",

    "abstract": "In distributed training of machine learning models, gradient descent with\nlocal iterative steps is a very popular method, variants of which are commonly\nknown as Local-SGD or the Federated Averaging (FedAvg). In this method,\ngradient steps based on local datasets are taken independently in distributed\ncompute nodes to update the local models, which are then aggregated\nintermittently. Although the existing convergence analysis suggests that with\nheterogeneous data, FedAvg encounters quick performance degradation as the\nnumber of local steps increases, it is shown to work quite well in practice,\nespecially in the distributed training of large language models. In this work\nwe try to explain this good performance from a viewpoint of implicit bias in\nLocal Gradient Descent (Local-GD) with a large number of local steps. In\noverparameterized regime, the gradient descent at each compute node would lead\nthe model to a specific direction locally. We characterize the dynamics of the\naggregated global model and compare it to the centralized model trained with\nall of the data in one place. In particular, we analyze the implicit bias of\ngradient descent on linear models, for both regression and classification\ntasks. Our analysis shows that the aggregated global model converges exactly to\nthe centralized model for regression tasks, and converges (in direction) to the\nsame feasible set as centralized model for classification tasks. We further\npropose a Modified Local-GD with a refined aggregation and theoretically show\nit converges to the centralized model in direction for linear classification.\nWe empirically verified our theoretical findings in linear models and also\nconducted experiments on distributed fine-tuning of pretrained neural networks\nto further apply our theory.",

In\nthis paper, we expanded that distribution to regions beyond the accretion zone\nof Saturn. We integrated the orbits of a large ensemble of planetesimals and\nstudied the rate of their capture by the growing proto-Jupiter. In order to be\nconsistent with our previous studies, we did not consider the effect of the\nnebular gas. Results demonstrated that the exterior planetesimals, especially\nthose beyond 8 AU, have only slight contributions to the growth and metallicity\nof the growing Jupiter. The final mass and composition of this planet is mainly\ndue to the planetesimals inside and around its accretion zone. Our study shows\nthat although the rate of capture varies slightly by the size and composition\nof planetesimals, in general, the final results are independent of the size and\nmaterial of these bodies.

Similar to the RASHS approach, the\noutcome of the GRASHS approach is the transformation of the necessary\nconditions of optimality from a multi-point boundary value problem to a\ntwo-point boundary value problem, which is simpler to handle. This is\naccomplished by converting the arbitrary boolean logic to the disjunctive\nnormal form and applying smoothing using sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent\nfunctions. The GRASHS approach is demonstrated by optimizing a Mars entry,\ndescent, and landing trajectory, where the parachute descent segment is active\nwhen the velocity is below the parachute deployment velocity or the altitude is\nbelow the parachute deployment altitude, and the altitude is above the powered\ndescent initiation altitude. This set of conditions represents a combination of\nAND and OR logic. The previously introduced RASHS approach is not designed to\nhandle such problems. The proposed GRASHS approach aims to fill this gap.",

Typically, the control of interaction torques in\npartial-assistance exoskeletons relies on a hierarchical control structure.\nThese approaches require extensive calibration due to the complexity of the\ncontroller and user-specific parameter tuning, especially for activities like\nstair or ramp navigation. To address the limitations of hierarchical control in\nexoskeletons, this work proposes a three-step, data-driven approach: (1) using\nrecent sensor data to probabilistically infer locomotion states (landing step\nlength, landing step height, walking velocity, step clearance, gait phase), (2)\nallowing therapists to modify these features via a user interface, and (3)\nusing the adjusted locomotion features to predict the desired joint posture and\nmodel stiffness in a spring-damper system based on prediction uncertainty. We\nevaluated the proposed approach with two healthy participants engaging in\ntreadmill walking and stair ascent and descent at varying speeds, with and\nwithout external modification of the gait features through a user interface.\nResults showed a variation in kinematics according to the gait characteristics\nand a negative interaction power suggesting exoskeleton assistance across the\ndifferent conditions.",

Therefore, we propose\nMOFHEI, a framework that optimizes the model to make HE-based neural network\ninference, referred to as private inference (PI), fast and efficient. First,\nour proposed learning-based method automatically transforms a pre-trained ML\nmodel into its compatible version with HE operations, called the HE-friendly\nversion. Then, our iterative block pruning method prunes the model's parameters\nin configurable block shapes in alignment with the data packing method. This\nallows us to drop a significant number of costly HE operations, thereby\nreducing the latency and memory consumption while maintaining the model's\nperformance. We evaluate our framework through extensive experiments on\ndifferent models using various datasets.

In low-power jets, such as those in Fanaroff-Riley I (FR I)\ngalaxies, the jet-star interactions can notably affect jet deceleration and\nenergy dissipation.\n  Recent numerical studies suggest that mass loading from stellar winds is a\nkey factor in decelerating jets, accounting for many observed characteristics\nin FR I jets. Additionally, a radio-optical positional offset has been\nobserved, with optical emission detected further down the jet than radio\nemission. This observation may challenge traditional explanations based solely\non recollimation shocks and instabilities.\n  This work utilizes the radiative transfer code RIPTIDE to generate synthetic\nsynchrotron maps, from a population of re-accelerated electrons, in both radio\nand optical bands from jet simulations incorporating various mass-loading\nprofiles and distributions of gas and stars within the ambient medium.\n  Our findings emphasize the importance of mass entrainment in replicating the\nextended and diffuse radio/optical emissions observed in FR I jets and\nexplaining the radio-optical offsets. These offsets are influenced by the\ngalaxy's physical properties, the surrounding stellar populations, and\nobservational biases. We successfully reproduce typical radio-optical offsets\nby considering a mass-load equivalent to $10^{-9}~M_\\odot \\cdot \\rm{yr}^{-1}\n\\cdot \\rm{pc}^{-3}$.

    "abstract": "As of 2023, a record 117 million people have been displaced worldwide, more\nthan double the number from a decade ago [22]. Of these, 32 million are\nrefugees under the UNHCR mandate, with 8.7 million residing in refugee camps. A\ncritical issue faced by these populations is the lack of access to electricity,\nwith 80% of the 8.7 million refugees and displaced persons in camps globally\nrelying on traditional biomass for cooking and lacking reliable power for\nessential tasks such as cooking and charging phones. Often, the burden of\ncollecting firewood falls on women and children, who frequently travel up to 20\nkilometers into dangerous areas, increasing their vulnerability.[7]\n  Electricity access could significantly alleviate these challenges, but a\nmajor obstacle is the lack of accurate power grid infrastructure maps,\nparticularly in resource-constrained environments like refugee camps, needed\nfor energy access planning. Existing power grid maps are often outdated,\nincomplete, or dependent on costly, complex technologies, limiting their\npracticality. To address this issue, PGRID is a novel application-based\napproach, which utilizes high-resolution aerial imagery to detect electrical\npoles and segment electrical lines, creating precise power grid maps. PGRID was\ntested in the Turkana region of Kenya, specifically the Kakuma and Kalobeyei\nCamps, covering 84 km2 and housing over 200,000 residents.\n  Our findings show that PGRID delivers high-fidelity power grid maps\nespecially in unplanned settlements, with F1-scores of 0.71 and 0.82 for pole\ndetection and line segmentation, respectively. This study highlights a\npractical application for leveraging open data and limited labels to improve\npower grid mapping in unplanned settlements, where the growing number of\ndisplaced persons urgently need sustainable energy infrastructure solutions.",

We then propose\nconcrete and statistically rigorous procedures to determine a threshold for the\ngiven LLM evaluation metric using available ground-truth data.

In the early stages of carbon burning, called the simmering phase, energy\nreleased by the reactions in the core drive the formation and growth of a core\nconvection zone. One aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, a\nlinking of weak nuclear reactions to convection, which may alter the\ncomposition and structure of the white dwarf. The convective Urca process is\nnot well understood and requires 3D fluid simulations to properly model the\nturbulent convection, an inherently 3D process. Because the neutron excess of\nthe fluid both sets and is set by the extent of the convection zone, the\nrealistic steady state can only be determined in simulations with real 3D\nmixing processes. Additionally, the convection is relatively slow (Mach number\nless than 0.005) and thus a low Mach number method is needed to model the flow\nover many convective turnovers. Using the MAESTROeX low Mach number\nhydrodynamic software, we present the first full star 3D simulations of the\nA=23 convective Urca process, spanning hundreds of convective turnover times.\nOur findings on the extent of mixing across the Urca shell, the characteristic\nvelocities of the flow, the energy loss rates due to neutrino emission, and the\nstructure of the convective boundary can be used to inform 1D stellar models\nthat track the longer-timescale evolution.",

In the present\nwork, we give two sets of necessary and sufficient conditions for a\ndifferential operator $L$ to have a unitary monodromy group, and we construct\nthe form $H$ explicitly. First, in the case that the natural representation of\n$G$ on $\\mathbb{C}^2$ is irreducible, we show that unitarity is equivalent to a\nset of easily-verified trace conditions on local monodromy matrices; in the\ncase that it is reducible, we show that $G$ is unitary if and only if it is\nconjugate to a subgroup of one of two model subgroups of\n$\\operatorname{GL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$. Second, we show that unitarity of $G$ is\nequivalent to a criterion on the real dimension of the algebra $A$ generated by\na rescaled group $G'\\subset\\operatorname{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$: that $\\dim(A)=1$\nif $G\\subset S^1$ is scalar, $\\dim(A)=2$ if $G$ is abelian, $\\dim(A)=3$ if $G$\nis non-abelian but its action on $\\mathbb{C}^2$ is reducible, and $\\dim(A)=4$\notherwise.

    "abstract": "Gaussian processes (GPs) and Gaussian random fields (GRFs) are essential for\nmodelling spatially varying stochastic phenomena. Yet, the efficient generation\nof corresponding realisations on high-resolution grids remains challenging,\nparticularly when a large number of realisations are required. This paper\npresents two novel contributions. First, we propose a new methodology based on\nDirichlet-Neumann averaging (DNA) to generate GPs and GRFs with isotropic\ncovariance on regularly spaced grids. The combination of discrete cosine and\nsine transforms in the DNA sampling approach allows for rapid evaluations\nwithout the need for modification or padding of the desired covariance\nfunction. While this introduces an error in the covariance, our numerical\nexperiments show that this error is negligible for most relevant applications,\nrepresenting a trade-off between efficiency and precision. We provide explicit\nerror estimates for Mat\\'ern covariances. The second contribution links our new\nmethodology to the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach for\nsampling GRFs. We demonstrate that the concepts developed in our methodology\ncan also guide the selection of boundary conditions in the SPDE framework. We\nprove that averaging specific GRFs sampled via the SPDE approach yields\ngenuinely isotropic realisations without domain extension, with the error\nbounds established in the first part remaining valid.",

As a result, MDC has never been widely adopted.\nInspired by the potential of neural video codecs, this paper rethinks MDC\ndesign. We propose a novel MDC video codec, NeuralMDC, demonstrating how\nbidirectional transformers trained for masked token prediction can vastly\nsimplify the design of MDC video codec. To compress a video, NeuralMDC starts\nby tokenizing each frame into its latent representation and then splits the\nlatent tokens to create multiple descriptions containing correlated\ninformation. Instead of using motion prediction and warping operations,\nNeuralMDC trains a bidirectional masked transformer to model the\nspatial-temporal dependencies of latent representations and predict the\ndistribution of the current representation based on the past. The predicted\ndistribution is used to independently entropy code each description and infer\nany potentially lost tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate NeuralMDC\nachieves state-of-the-art loss resilience with minimal sacrifices in\ncompression efficiency, significantly outperforming the best existing\nresidual-coding-based error-resilient neural video codec.",

    "abstract": "Fidelity quantum kernels have shown promise in classification tasks,\nparticularly when a group structure in the data can be identified and exploited\nthrough a covariant feature map. In fact, there exist classification problems\non which covariant kernels provide a provable advantage, thus establishing a\nseparation between quantum and classical learners. However, their practical\napplication poses two challenges: on one side, the group structure may be\nunknown and approximate in real-world data, and on the other side, scaling to\nthe `utility' regime (above 100 qubits) is affected by exponential\nconcentration. In this work, we address said challenges by applying fidelity\nkernels to real-world data with unknown structure, related to the scheduling of\na fleet of electric vehicles, and to synthetic data generated from the union of\nsubspaces, which is then close to many relevant real-world datasets.\nFurthermore, we propose a novel error mitigation strategy specifically tailored\nfor fidelity kernels, called Bit Flip Tolerance (BFT), to alleviate the\nexponential concentration in our utility-scale experiments. Our multiclass\nclassification reaches accuracies comparable to classical SVCs up to 156\nqubits, thus constituting the largest experimental demonstration of quantum\nmachine learning on IBM devices to date. For the real-world data experiments,\nthe effect of the proposed BFT becomes manifest on 40+ qubits, where mitigated\naccuracies reach 80%, in line with classical, compared to 33% without BFT.\nThrough the union-of-subspace synthetic dataset with 156 qubits, we demonstrate\na mitigated accuracy of 80%, compared to 83% of classical models, and 37% of\nunmitigated quantum, using a test set of limited size.",

We leverage a natural app-update event at Replika AI,\na popular US-based AI companion, to shed light on these questions. We find\nthat, after the app removed its erotic role play (ERP) feature, preventing\nintimate interactions between consumers and chatbots that were previously\npossible, this event triggered perceptions in customers that their AI\ncompanion's identity had discontinued. This in turn predicted negative consumer\nwelfare and marketing outcomes related to loss, including mourning the loss,\nand devaluing the \"new\" AI relative to the \"original\". Experimental evidence\nconfirms these findings. Further experiments find that AI companions users feel\ncloser to their AI companion than even their best human friend, and mourn a\nloss of their AI companion more than a loss of various other inanimate\nproducts. In short, consumers are forming human-level relationships with AI\ncompanions; disruptions to these relationships trigger real patterns of\nmourning as well as devaluation of the offering; and the degree of mourning and\ndevaluation are explained by perceived discontinuity in the AIs identity. Our\nresults illustrate that relationships with AI are truly personal, creating\nunique benefits and risks for consumers and firms alike.",

The dual objectives are to\nobtain improved constraints on parameters present in the turbulence transport\nmodel (TTM) and to support comparisons of distinct versions of the TTM. The\nTTMs analysed are essentially 1D steady-state presented in [BreechEA08] that\ndescribe the radial evolution of the energy, correlation length, and normalized\ncross helicity of the fluctuations, together with the proton temperature, in\nprescribed background solar wind fields. Modelled effects present in the TTM\ninclude nonlinear turbulence interactions, shear driving, and energy injection\nassociated with pickup-ions. These effects involve adjustable parameters that\nwe seek to constrain. Bayesian analysis supports the efficient searching of a\nparameter space for the 'best' set of TTM parameter values. More advanced use\nprovides the parameter's posterior distribution: its probability given the\ndata, and the model. This can be used to understand the uncertainty in the\nprovided 'best' values for the parameters and therefore the uncertainty in the\nsuggested TTM solutions/predictions. By using NS, we can calculate the Bayesian\nevidence for each TTM and objectively determine which best fits the given\nobservational data. Based on the analysis of the datasets and TTM employed, we\nrecommend use of the 2D TTM with von Karman-Howarth parameters ${\\alpha}\\approx\n0.16$ and $\\beta \\approx 0.10$ and parameter assumptions from existing\nliterature. It is important to include the pickup ion effects in the\nlengthscale evolution equation by assuming $Z^{2\\beta/\\alpha}\\lambda = const$\nis locally conserved.

Learning accurate\nmodels requires effectively capturing the state of a patient, either through\nsequence representation learning or carefully crafted summaries of their\nmedical history. While recent work has favored the former, it remains a\nquestion as to how histories should best be represented for interpretable\npolicy modeling. Focused on model fit, we systematically compare diverse\napproaches to summarizing patient history for interpretable modeling of\nclinical policies across four sequential decision-making tasks. We illustrate\ndifferences in the policies learned using various representations by breaking\ndown evaluations by patient subgroups, critical states, and stages of\ntreatment, highlighting challenges specific to common use cases. We find that\ninterpretable sequence models using learned representations perform on par with\nblack-box models across all tasks. Interpretable models using hand-crafted\nrepresentations perform substantially worse when ignoring history entirely, but\nare made competitive by incorporating only a few aggregated and recent elements\nof patient history.

Although the critical temperature (Tc) in FeSe increases\nsignificantly with applied pressure, intercalation, and in thin films, the\neffect of replacing selenium with sulfur in FeSe1-xSx has remained unclear. To\ninvestigate the effects of chemical pressure, we have synthesized FeSe1-xSx\ncrystals (up to x = 0.52) and intercalated them with tetramethylammonium ions\n(TMA+). Our results show that both Tc and unit cell volume decrease linearly\nwith sulfur content in both host and intercalated (TMA)yFe2(Se1-xSx)2. The\nunexpected common rate of normalized decrease of Tc suggests that chemical\npressure affects the electron-doped intercalates in the same way as the host\ncompounds. This result highlights the unique role of chemical pressure and\nelectron doping in tuning superconductivity in FeSe systems and provides new\ninsights into their complex behavior.",

Although such 'treat or not'\ndecisions are common, prognostic models are also often used to tailor and\npersonalise the care of patients, which implicitly involves the consideration\nof multiple interventions at different risk thresholds.\n  We extend the net benefit to consider multiple decision thresholds\nsimultaneously, by taking a weighted area under a rescaled version of the net\nbenefit curve, deriving the continuous net benefit.

    "abstract": "In this study, we considered the optical wavelength of Gaia DR3 to analyze\npoorly studied three newly open star clusters namely OCSN 203, OCSN 213, and\nOCSN 244 clusters with ASTECA code. Here, we identified candidates of 227, 200,\nand 551 with highly probable ($P \\geq 50\\%$) members. Fitting King's profile\nwithin RDPs allows us to estimate inner stellar structures like core (0.190\n$\\le r_{\\rm c}$ (pc) $\\le$ 1.284) and the limiting (0.327 $\\le r_{\\rm cl}$ (pc)\n$\\le 1.302$) radii. Constructing CMDs fitted with suitable log age (yr) between\n(log t; 6.52 - 7.05) and metallicities (Z; 0.01308-0.01413) isochrones.\nTherefore, the estimated photometric parameters with CMDs, reflect the\nheliocentric distances are 332 $\\pm$ 18, 529 $\\pm$ 23, and 506 $\\pm$ 23 (pc)\nfor OCSN 203, OCSN 213, and OCSN 244, respectively.

The overall mass function reflects the slopes\n($\\alpha$) for Salpeter within the uncertainty are ($\\alpha_{OCSN203}$ = 2.41\n$\\pm$ 0.06), ($\\alpha_{OCSN213}$ = 2.13 $\\pm$ 0.07), and ($\\alpha_{OCSN244}$ =\n2.28 $\\pm$ 0.07). The results of this study which employed a dynamical analysis\nover varying timescales indicate that OCSN 203 and OCSN 244 are clusters that\nhave undergone significant relaxation, with a dynamical evolution parameter\n($\\tau$) that is much greater than one. In contrast, OCSN 213 exhibits\ncharacteristics of a non-relaxed cluster.

Unlike existing studies that\nfocus primarily on optimizing long-term performance in steady states, we\ndevelop online learning algorithms that enable rapid adaptation to sudden\nchanges. Recognizing that many current network optimization algorithms rely on\ndual methods to iteratively learn optimal Lagrange multipliers, we propose\nzero-shot updates for these multipliers using only information available at the\ntime of abrupt changes. By combining Taylor series analysis with complementary\nslackness conditions, we theoretically derive zero-shot updates applicable to\nvarious abrupt changes in two distinct network optimization problems. These\nupdates can be integrated with existing algorithms to significantly improve\nperformance during transitory phases in terms of total utility, operational\ncost, and constraint violations. Simulation results demonstrate that our\nzero-shot updates substantially improve transitory performance, often achieving\nnear-optimal outcomes without additional learning, even under severe system\nchanges.",

Threading in these systems arises from the\ninterplay between the intrinsic topology of and within the star-shaped\nstructure and the bending rigidity of individual rings. It is demonstrated that\nreduced ring flexibility enhances threading, and the presence of mechanical\nbonds is critical for threading formation. Notably, the bending rigidity of the\nrings alters their shapes, resulting in a non-monotonic threading probability\nwith a peak at intermediate rigidity.

In this study, we introduce the \"elastic softening\napproximation,\" an alternative approach to modeling intrinsic anharmonic\neffects on thermodynamic quantities, which is grounded in Wallace's\nthermodynamic framework that tracks entropy changes resulting from the\ncontinuous change (e.g., softening) of phonons as a function of temperature. A\nkey finding of our study is a direct correlation between Poisson's ratio and\nthe differential rate of phonon softening at finite frequencies, compared to\nlower frequencies relevant to elastic moduli measurements. We observe that\nelemental solids such as $\\alpha$-Be, diamond, Al, Cu, In, W, Au, and Pb, which\nspan a wide range of Poisson's ratios and exhibit varying degrees of intrinsic\nanharmonicity, consistently follow this trend. When applied to $\\alpha$-U,\n$\\alpha$-Pu, and $\\delta$-Pu, our method reveals unusually large anharmonic\nphonon contributions at elevated temperatures across all three light actinide\nmetals. These findings are attributed to the unique combination of enhanced\ncovalency and softer elastic moduli inherent in the actinides, potentially\ninfluenced by their 5f-electron bonding.",

In this paper, the cosmological\nevolution with broken diffeomorphism invariance is investigated in the\n(modified) FLRW spacetime in the effective theory framework. The GR Lagrangian\nis augmented with all diffeomorphism-breaking but Lorentz-invariant terms in\nthe leading order, namely, those involving two derivatives.

    "abstract": "We report the discovery and characterisation of a Lya blob close to a galaxy\nat redshift z=3.49. We present our analysis to check whether the companion\ngalaxy could be the source of the ionised photons responsible for the Lya\nemission from the blob. We use images obtained from the 10.4 m GTC telescope\nthat are part of the SHARDS project. The blob is only visible in the F551W17\nfilter, centred around the Lya line at the redshift of the galaxy. We measure\nthe luminosity of the blob with a two-step procedure. First, we describe the\nradial surface brightness (SB) profile of the galaxy using a Sersic function.\nWe then remove this model from the SB profile of the blob and measure the\nluminosity of the blob alone. We also estimate the Lya continuum of the galaxy\nusing an ACS image from the HST in the filter F606W, that is wider than the\nSHARDS one and centred at about the same wavelength. In this image the galaxy\nis visible, but the blob is not detected, since its Lya emission is diluted in\nthe larger wavelength range of the F606W filter. We find that the Lya\nluminosity of the blob is 1.0x1043 erg s-1, in agreement with other Lya blobs\nreported in the literature. The luminosity of the galaxy in the same filter is\n2.9x1042 erg s-1. The luminosity within the HST/ACS image is Lcont=1.1x1043 erg\ns-1. With these values we are able to estimate the Lya equivalent width (EW),\nthat is found to be 111 {\\AA} (rest-frame). This value suggests that a\nsuper-cluster of massive (1-2x107 Msun) and young (2-4 Myr) stars could be\nresponsible for the ionisation of the blob. We also use two other methods to\nestimate the luminosity of the galaxy and the blob, both supporting our\nconclusions. It is worth noting that the Lya blob is spatially decoupled from\nthe galaxy by 5.7 kpc. This misalignment could suggest the presence of an\nionised cone of escaping material, as found in nearby galaxies such as M82.",

    "abstract": "We use a sample of 11 $z\\approx0.2-0.5$ ($z_{\\text{med.}} = 0.36$) galaxy\nclusters from the Cluster Lensing And Supernovae survey with Hubble (CLASH) to\nanalyse the angular dependence of satellite galaxy colour $(B-R)$ and passive\ngalaxy fraction ($f_{\\text{pass.}}$) with respect to the major axis of the\nbrightest cluster galaxy (BCG). This phenomenon has been dubbed as\n\\say{anisotropic quenching}, \\say{angular conformity} or \\say{angular\nsegregation}, and it describes how satellite galaxies along the major axis of\nthe BCG are more likely to be quenched than those along the minor axis. A\nhighly significant anisotropic quenching signal is found for satellites, with a\npeak in $(B-R)$ and $f_{\\text{pass.}}$ along the major axis. We are the first\nto measure anisotropic quenching out to cluster-centric radii of $3R_{200}$\n($R_{200\\text{, med.}} \\approx 933$ \\si{\\kilo\\parsec}). We find that the signal\nis significant out to at least $2.5R_{200}$, and the amplitude of the signal\npeaks at $\\approx1.25R_{200}$. This is the first time a radial peak of the\nanisotropic quenching signal has been measured directly. We suggest that this\npeak could be caused by a build-up of backsplash galaxies at this radius.\nFinally, we find that $f_{\\text{pass.}}$ is significantly higher along the\nmajor axis for fixed values of local surface density. The density drops less\nrapidly along the major axis and so satellites spend more time being\npre-processed here compared to the minor axis. We therefore conclude that\npre-processing in large-scale structure, and not active galactic nuclei\noutflows (AGN), is the cause of the anisotropic quenching signal in massive\ngalaxy clusters, however this may not be the cause in lower mass halos.",

We find that galaxies hosting USMgII systems are typically\nstar-forming main sequence galaxies, with 21% exhibiting a starburst nature.\nThe non-zero [O II] emission along the `clear' sightlines, with no stellar\ncounterpart, hints that the USMgII absorbers may likely emanate from the unseen\nfaint galaxies near the quasar. The USMgII absorbers preferentially align along\nthe major and minor axes of the galaxy, which suggests that they originate in\nthe disk or large-scale wind. We show that the distribution of $W_{2796}$ as a\nfunction of impact parameter indicates a discernible radial dependence for the\n`disk' and `wind' subsets, with the observed large scatter in $W_{2796}$\npotentially attributed to large-scale outflows.

Traditional root-finding techniques are\ncomputationally expensive, particularly for large-scale relativistic\nhydrodynamics simulations. To address this, we employ feedforward neural\nnetworks (NNC2PS and NNC2PL), trained in PyTorch and optimized for GPU\ninference using NVIDIA TensorRT, achieving significant speedups with minimal\naccuracy loss. The NNC2PS model achieves $ L_1 $ and $ L_\\infty $ errors of $\n4.54 \\times 10^{-7} $ and $ 3.44 \\times 10^{-6} $, respectively, while the\nNNC2PL model exhibits even lower error values. TensorRT optimization with\nmixed-precision deployment substantially accelerates performance compared to\ntraditional root-finding methods. Specifically, the mixed-precision TensorRT\nengine for NNC2PS achieves inference speeds approximately 400 times faster than\na traditional single-threaded CPU implementation for a dataset size of\n1,000,000 points. Ideal parallelization across an entire compute node in the\nDelta supercomputer (Dual AMD 64 core 2.45 GHz Milan processors; and 8 NVIDIA\nA100 GPUs with 40 GB HBM2 RAM and NVLink) predicts a 25-fold speedup for\nTensorRT over an optimally-parallelized numerical method when processing 8\nmillion data points. Moreover, the ML method exhibits sub-linear scaling with\nincreasing dataset sizes. We release the scientific software developed,\nenabling further validation and extension of our findings.

    "abstract": "The Hubble constant ($H_0$) is a key parameter in cosmology, yet its precise\nvalue remains contentious due to discrepancies between early- and late-universe\nmeasurement methods, a problem known as the \"Hubble tension.\" In this study, we\nrevisit the Cepheid-based distance ladder calibration, focusing on two\npotential sources of bias in the period-luminosity relation (PLR): (1) the\nassumed prior for the residual parallax offset of the Milky Way (MW) Cepheids\nand (2) systematic differences between Cepheid periods in anchor galaxies\nversus supernova host galaxies. To address the latter, we adopt two different\nstrategies alongside a renewed MW Cepheid calibration. The first strategy\ninvolves resampling anchor and host Cepheids from a common distribution of\nperiods. This approach provides a conservative estimate of $H_0 = (72.18 \\pm\n1.76) \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, including the renewed MW analysis. The increased\nuncertainty reflects the reduced sample size -- about 700 Cepheids per\nresampling compared to 3200 in the original dataset. This method reduces the\nHubble tension from $5.4 \\, \\sigma$ (as reported by the SH0ES collaboration\nwith $H_0 = (73.17 \\pm 0.86) \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$) to $2.4 \\, \\sigma$. The\nsecond strategy allows the PLR slope to vary with the period, yielding $H_0 =\n(72.35 \\pm 0.91) \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, including the renewed MW analysis, and\nthe tension reduced to $4.4 \\, \\sigma$. A statistical comparison of the model\nwith the single-linear PLR shows a significant preference for the broken PLR\n(p-value $< 0.001$). Both strategies consistently indicate a downward shift of\napproximately $-1 \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ in $H_0$. Our findings underscore the\nimportance of careful consideration of Cepheid population characteristics for\nprecise $H_0$ calibrations.",

    "abstract": "Measurements can qualitatively alter correlations and entanglement emerging\nin gapless quantum matter. We show how a single round of measurements on\ngapless quantum systems can, upon rotating the measurement basis, induce\nnon-trivial transitions separating regimes displaying universal characteristics\ngoverned by distinct boundary conformal field theories. We develop the theory\nof such `measurement-induced boundary transitions' by investigating a gapless\nparent of the one-dimensional cluster state, obtained by appropriately\nsymmetrizing a commuting projector Hamiltonian for the latter. Projective\nmeasurements on the cluster state are known to convert the wavefunction, after\npost-selection or decoding, into a long-range-ordered\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. Similar measurements applied to the\ngapless parent (i) generate long-range order coexisting with power-law\ncorrelations when post-selecting for uniform outcomes, and (ii) yield power-law\ncorrelations distinct from those in the pre-measurement state upon decoding. In\nthe post-selection scenario, rotating the measurement basis preserves\nlong-range order up until a critical tilt angle marking a measurement-induced\nboundary transition to a power-law-ordered regime. Such a transition -- which\ndoes not exist in the descendant cluster state -- establishes new connections\nbetween measurement effects on many-body states and non-trivial\nrenormalization-group flows. We extend our analysis to tricritical Ising and\nthree-state Potts critical theories, which also display measurement-induced\nboundary transitions, and propose general criteria for their existence in other\nsettings.",

    "abstract": "On the basis of a large collection of detailed 3D core-collapse supernova\nsimulations carried to late times, we identify four channels of stellar mass\nblack hole formation. Our examples for Channel 1 involve the formation of\nlower-gap and above black holes in energetic asymmetric supernova explosions.\nOur Channel 2 example involves a modest supernova explosion that may leave\nbehind a lower-gap to $\\sim$10 $M_{\\odot}$ black hole. The latter may not be\neasily distinguishable from ``standard\" supernovae that birth neutron stars.\nOur Channel 3 example experiences an aborted core-collapse explosion, more\noften in the context of a low-metallicity progenitor, whose residue is a black\nhole with a mass perhaps up to $\\sim$40 $M_{\\odot}$. The latter may be\naccompanied by a pulsational-pair instability supernova (PPISN). Channel 4 is\nthe only quiescent or ``silent\" scenario for which perhaps $\\sim$5 to 15\n$M_{\\odot}$ black holes are left. Where appropriate, we estimate $^{56}$Ni\nyields, explosion energies, approximate recoil speeds, and residual black hole\nmasses. The progenitor mass density and binding energy profiles at collapse\ninfluence the outcome in a systematic way. We speculate that the statistics and\nprevalence of these various channels depend not only on still evolving\nsupernova theory, but on remaining issues with the theory of massive star\nevolution, binary interaction, wind mass loss, metallicity, and the nuclear\nequation of state. Importantly, we suggest, but have not proven, that the\nsilent channel for black hole formation may not be the dominant formation\nmodality.",

We address this limitation by\nadapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive\ntransformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we\nextend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step\ndiffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality\ndistillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's\nODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that\nsupervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach\neffectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing\nlong-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model\nachieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all\nprevious video generation models.

However, these models struggle with low-resolution face\ndatasets, in which the faces lack the facial attributes necessary for\ndistinguishing different faces. Full fine-tuning on low-resolution datasets, a\nnaive method for adapting the model, yields inferior performance due to\ncatastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge. Additionally the domain\ndifference between high-resolution (HR) gallery images and low-resolution (LR)\nprobe images in low resolution datasets leads to poor convergence for a single\nmodel to adapt to both gallery and probe after fine-tuning. To this end, we\npropose PETALface, a Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning approach for\nlow-resolution face recognition. Through PETALface, we attempt to solve both\nthe aforementioned problems. (1) We solve catastrophic forgetting by leveraging\nthe power of parameter efficient fine-tuning(PEFT). (2) We introduce two\nlow-rank adaptation modules to the backbone, with weights adjusted based on the\ninput image quality to account for the difference in quality for the gallery\nand probe images. To the best of our knowledge, PETALface is the first work\nleveraging the powers of PEFT for low resolution face recognition.

Large scale synthetic and\nobject-centric 3D datasets have shown to be effective in training models that\nhave 3D understanding of objects. However, applying a similar approach to\nreal-world objects and scenes is difficult due to a lack of large-scale data.\nVideos are a potential source for real-world 3D data, but finding diverse yet\ncorresponding views of the same content has shown to be difficult at scale.\nFurthermore, standard videos come with fixed viewpoints, determined at the time\nof capture.

By leveraging user feedback\nwith interactive prompts at a frame, e.g., a simple click or draw of boxes, TTC\ncould immediately update the corresponding detection results for future\nstreaming inputs, even though the model is deployed with fixed parameters. This\nenables autonomous driving systems to adapt to new scenarios immediately and\ndecrease deployment risks reliably without additional expensive training. To\nachieve such TTC system, we equip existing 3D detectors with Online Adapter\n(OA) module, a prompt-driven query generator for online correction. At the core\nof OA module are visual prompts, images of missed object-of-interest for\nguiding the corresponding detection and subsequent tracking. Those visual\nprompts, belonging to missed objects through online inference, are maintained\nby the visual prompt buffer for continuous error correction in subsequent\nframes. By doing so, TTC consistently detects online missed objects and\nimmediately lowers driving risks. It achieves reliable, versatile, and adaptive\ndriving autonomy. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant gain on instant\nerror rectification over pre-trained 3D detectors, even in challenging\nscenarios with limited labels, zero-shot detection, and adverse conditions.

We consider the cosmological\ncorrelation between the different tracers and we account for the systematic\nuncertainties that are shared between the large-scale lensing correlation\nfunctions and the small-scale lensing-based cluster mass calibration.\nMarginalized over the remaining $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\\Lambda$CDM)\nparameters (including the sum of neutrino masses) and 52 astrophysical modeling\nparameters, we measure $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}=0.300\\pm0.017$ and\n$\\sigma_8=0.797\\pm0.026$. Compared to constraints from Planck primary cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) anisotropies, our constraints are only 15% wider\nwith a probability to exceed of 0.22 ($1.2\\sigma$) for the two-parameter\ndifference.

Assuming a $w$CDM model, we constrain the dark energy equation\nof state parameter $w=-1.15^{+0.23}_{-0.17}$ and when combining with Planck\nprimary CMB anisotropies, we recover $w=-1.20^{+0.15}_{-0.09}$, a $1.7\\sigma$\ndifference with a cosmological constant.

    "abstract": "Autonomous robot navigation in off-road environments presents a number of\nchallenges due to its lack of structure, making it difficult to handcraft\nrobust heuristics for diverse scenarios. While learned methods using hand\nlabels or self-supervised data improve generalizability, they often require a\ntremendous amount of data and can be vulnerable to domain shifts. To improve\ngeneralization in novel environments, recent works have incorporated adaptation\nand self-supervision to develop autonomous systems that can learn from their\nown experiences online. However, current works often rely on significant prior\ndata, for example minutes of human teleoperation data for each terrain type,\nwhich is difficult to scale with more environments and robots. To address these\nlimitations, we propose SALON, a perception-action framework for fast\nadaptation of traversability estimates with minimal human input. SALON rapidly\nlearns online from experience while avoiding out of distribution terrains to\nproduce adaptive and risk-aware cost and speed maps. Within seconds of\ncollected experience, our results demonstrate comparable navigation performance\nover kilometer-scale courses in diverse off-road terrain as methods trained on\n100-1000x more data. We additionally show promising results on significantly\ndifferent robots in different environments. Our code is available at\nhttps://theairlab.org/SALON.",

    "abstract": "Achieving noise resilience is an outstanding challenge in Hamiltonian-based\nquantum computation. To this end, energy-gap protection provides a promising\napproach, where the desired quantum dynamics are encoded into the ground space\nof a penalty Hamiltonian that suppresses unwanted noise processes. However,\nexisting approaches either explicitly require high-weight penalty terms that\nare not directly accessible in current hardware, or utilize non-commuting\n$2$-local Hamiltonians, which typically leads to an exponentially small energy\ngap. In this work, we provide a general recipe for designing error-resilient\nHamiltonian simulations, making use of an excited encoding subspace stabilized\nby solely $2$-local commuting Hamiltonians. Our results thus overcome a no-go\ntheorem previously derived for ground-space encoding that prevents noise\nsuppression schemes with such Hamiltonians. Importantly, our method is scalable\nas it only requires penalty terms that scale polynomially with system size. To\nillustrate the utility of our approach, we further apply this method to a\nvariety of $1$- and $2$-dimensional many-body spin models, potentially\nextending the duration of high-fidelity simulation by orders of magnitude in\ncurrent hardware.",

Proposed mutations can be informed\nby previous measurements or by learning from large antibody databases to\npredict only typical antibodies. Unfortunately, the space of typical antibodies\nis enormous to search, and experiments often fail to find suitable antibodies\non a budget. We introduce Clone-informed Bayesian Optimization (CloneBO), a\nBayesian optimization procedure that efficiently optimizes antibodies in the\nlab by teaching a generative model how our immune system optimizes antibodies.\nOur immune system makes antibodies by iteratively evolving specific portions of\ntheir sequences to bind their target strongly and stably, resulting in a set of\nrelated, evolving sequences known as a clonal family. We train a large language\nmodel, CloneLM, on hundreds of thousands of clonal families and use it to\ndesign sequences with mutations that are most likely to optimize an antibody\nwithin the human immune system. We propose to guide our designs to fit previous\nmeasurements with a twisted sequential Monte Carlo procedure.

    "abstract": "The modern paradigm in machine learning involves pre-training on diverse\ndata, followed by task-specific fine-tuning. In reinforcement learning (RL),\nthis translates to learning via offline RL on a diverse historical dataset,\nfollowed by rapid online RL fine-tuning using interaction data. Most RL\nfine-tuning methods require continued training on offline data for stability\nand performance. However, this is undesirable because training on diverse\noffline data is slow and expensive for large datasets, and in principle, also\nlimit the performance improvement possible because of constraints or pessimism\non offline data. In this paper, we show that retaining offline data is\nunnecessary as long as we use a properly-designed online RL approach for\nfine-tuning offline RL initializations. To build this approach, we start by\nanalyzing the role of retaining offline data in online fine-tuning. We find\nthat continued training on offline data is mostly useful for preventing a\nsudden divergence in the value function at the onset of fine-tuning, caused by\na distribution mismatch between the offline data and online rollouts. This\ndivergence typically results in unlearning and forgetting the benefits of\noffline pre-training. Our approach, Warm-start RL (WSRL), mitigates the\ncatastrophic forgetting of pre-trained initializations using a very simple\nidea. WSRL employs a warmup phase that seeds the online RL run with a very\nsmall number of rollouts from the pre-trained policy to do fast online RL. The\ndata collected during warmup helps ``recalibrate'' the offline Q-function to\nthe online distribution, allowing us to completely discard offline data without\ndestabilizing the online RL fine-tuning. We show that WSRL is able to fine-tune\nwithout retaining any offline data, and is able to learn faster and attains\nhigher performance than existing algorithms irrespective of whether they retain\noffline data or not.",

To overcome this problem, we introduce\n3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D\nspace, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of\nentities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded\nobject injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D\ntrajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit\nan injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is\ncrucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we\nintroduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling\nstrategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we\nconstruct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and\nanimal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with\n12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments\nshow that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and\ngeneralization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

    "abstract": "We study rotating hybrid stars, with a particular emphasis on the effect of a\ndeconfinement phase transition on their properties at high spin. Our analysis\nis based on a hybrid equation of state (EoS) with a phase transition from\nhypernuclear matter to color-superconducting quark matter, where both phases\nare described within a relativistic density functional approach. By varying the\nvector meson and diquark couplings in the quark matter phase, we obtain\ndifferent hybrid star sequences with varying extension of the quark matter\ncore, ensuring consistency with astrophysical constraints from mass, radius and\ntidal deformability measurements. As a result, we demonstrate the impact of an\nincreasing rotational frequency on the maximum gravitational mass, the central\nenergy density of compact stars, the appearance of the quasi-radial\noscillations and non-axisymmetric instabilities. We demonstrate that for the\nmost favorable parameter sets with a strong vector coupling, hybrid star\nconfigurations with color superconducting quark matter core can describe the\nfastest spinning and heaviest galactic neutron star (NS) J0952-0607, while it\nis out of reach for the purely hadronic hypernuclear star configuration. We\nalso revise the previously proposed empirical relation between the Kepler\nfrequency, gravitational mass, and radius of non-rotating NSs, obtained based\non the assumption that all NSs, up to the heaviest, are hadronic. We show how\nthe phase transition to quark matter alters this relation and, consequently,\nthe constraints on the dense matter EoS. Our findings reveal that incorporating\nthe hybrid EoS has significant implications for the constraints on the\nproperties of strongly interacting matter and NSs, placing the upper limit on\n$R_{1.4} \\leq 14.90$ km and $R_{0.7}<11.49$ km (considering 716 Hz frequency\nlimit from J1748+2446ad) and $R_{1.4}\\leq$11.90~km (for 1000 Hz).",

In the heavy quark\nlimit, the BT model yields covariant form factors and Isgur-Wise (IW) scaling,\nregardless of the spectroscopic model used to describe the bound states. It has\nbeen extensively applied to heavy mesons where subtle properties of the IW\nlimit of QCD, including the Bjorken-Uraltsev sum rules, have been shown to be\nsatisfied. The present paper, where the BT construction is applied to baryons,\nis unavoidably technical because one is dealing with a three-body problem. The\ncomplications originate from the natural choice of the Jacobi coordinates\n${\\vec \\rho}$ (relative space coordinate between the two light spectator\nquarks) and ${\\vec \\lambda}$ (relative space coordinate between the\ncenter-of-mass of the two light quarks and the heavy quark).

For\nthe transitions $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda_c\\left({1 \\over 2}^\\pm\\right)$, i.e. $L\n= 0 \\to L = 0$ or $L = 0 \\to L = 1$, one can see that the moduli $\\ell_\\rho$\nand $\\ell_\\lambda$ can take an infinite number of values.

While many studies highlight\nthat large multimodal language models (MLMs) struggle to reason about space,\nthey only focus on static spatial relationships, and not dynamic awareness of\nmotion and space, i.e., reasoning about the effect of egocentric and object\nmotions on spatial relationships. Manually annotating such object and camera\nmovements is expensive. Hence, we introduce SAT, a simulated spatial aptitude\ntraining dataset comprising both static and dynamic spatial reasoning across\n175K question-answer (QA) pairs and 20K scenes. Complementing this, we also\nconstruct a small (150 image-QAs) yet challenging dynamic spatial test set\nusing real-world images. Leveraging our SAT datasets and 6 existing static\nspatial benchmarks, we systematically investigate what improves both static and\ndynamic spatial awareness. Our results reveal that simulations are surprisingly\neffective at imparting spatial aptitude to MLMs that translate to real images.\nWe show that perfect annotations in simulation are more effective than existing\napproaches of pseudo-annotating real images. For instance, SAT training\nimproves a LLaVA-13B model by an average 11% and a LLaVA-Video-7B model by an\naverage 8% on multiple spatial benchmarks, including our real-image dynamic\ntest set and spatial reasoning on long videos -- even outperforming some large\nproprietary models.

    "abstract": "Emerging 3D geometric foundation models, such as DUSt3R, offer a promising\napproach for in-the-wild 3D vision tasks. However, due to the high-dimensional\nnature of the problem space and scarcity of high-quality 3D data, these\npre-trained models still struggle to generalize to many challenging\ncircumstances, such as limited view overlap or low lighting. To address this,\nwe propose LoRA3D, an efficient self-calibration pipeline to\n$\\textit{specialize}$ the pre-trained models to target scenes using their own\nmulti-view predictions. Taking sparse RGB images as input, we leverage robust\noptimization techniques to refine multi-view predictions and align them into a\nglobal coordinate frame. In particular, we incorporate prediction confidence\ninto the geometric optimization process, automatically re-weighting the\nconfidence to better reflect point estimation accuracy. We use the calibrated\nconfidence to generate high-quality pseudo labels for the calibrating views and\nuse low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the models on the pseudo-labeled\ndata. Our method does not require any external priors or manual labels. It\ncompletes the self-calibration process on a $\\textbf{single standard GPU within\njust 5 minutes}$. Each low-rank adapter requires only $\\textbf{18MB}$ of\nstorage.

    "abstract": "Style control has been popular in video generation models. Existing methods\noften generate videos far from the given style, cause content leakage, and\nstruggle to transfer one video to the desired style. Our first observation is\nthat the style extraction stage matters, whereas existing methods emphasize\nglobal style but ignore local textures. In order to bring texture features\nwhile preventing content leakage, we filter content-related patches while\nretaining style ones based on prompt-patch similarity; for global style\nextraction, we generate a paired style dataset through model illusion to\nfacilitate contrastive learning, which greatly enhances the absolute style\nconsistency. Moreover, to fill in the image-to-video gap, we train a\nlightweight motion adapter on still videos, which implicitly enhances\nstylization extent, and enables our image-trained model to be seamlessly\napplied to videos. Benefited from these efforts, our approach, StyleMaster, not\nonly achieves significant improvement in both style resemblance and temporal\ncoherence, but also can easily generalize to video style transfer with a gray\ntile ControlNet. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that\nStyleMaster significantly outperforms competitors, effectively generating\nhigh-quality stylized videos that align with textual content and closely\nresemble the style of reference images.

The proof relies on several limiting\nprocedures on a family of solutions of equations with sources supported on ever\nsmaller sizes. In particular, uniform estimates on the fluxes of these\nsolutions are derived in order to control the singularity produced by the flux\nat zero. We further show that, up to the multiplication by a scalar, flux\nsolutions averaged in size and integrated in time, are bounded from above by\nthe explicit solution, $x^{-\\frac{\\gamma+3}{2}}$, of the constant flux\nequation, where $\\gamma$ is the homogeneity of the bounds of the coagulation\nrate kernel.

One of the most popular applications of Gaussian Splatting is to\ncreate animatable avatars, known as Gaussian Avatars. Recent works have pushed\nthe boundaries of quality and rendering efficiency but suffer from two main\nlimitations. Either they require expensive multi-camera rigs to produce avatars\nwith free-view rendering, or they can be trained with a single camera but only\nrendered at high quality from this fixed viewpoint. An ideal model would be\ntrained using a short monocular video or image from available hardware, such as\na webcam, and rendered from any view.

We have used Gaia DR3 data to study the velocity distribution\nof massive O and Be stars from the GOSC and BeSS catalogs and identify runaway\nstars using a 2D-velocity method. We have discovered 42 new runaways from GOSC\nand 47 from BeSS, among a total of 106 and 69 runaways found within these\ncatalogs, respectively. These numbers imply a percentage of runaways of ~25%\nfor O-type stars ~5% for Be-type stars. The higher percentages and higher\nvelocities found for O-type compared to Be-type runaways suggest that the\ndynamical ejection scenario is more likely than the supernova explosion\nscenario. We have also performed multi-wavelength studies of our runaways. We\nhave used WISE infrared images to discover 13 new stellar bow shocks around the\nrunaway stars.

However, the precision with which\nthey estimate signal strength has never been evaluated. To this point, the\nwidth of the confidence interval for a signal strength estimate can serve as a\ncriterion for assessing the precision of such estimates: the narrower the\nconfidence interval, the more precise the estimate.

We have found that in some cases, by reusing the\nallocation matrix from the original instance as an initial solution, the SMRC\nand/or the PMRC can significantly boost the optimization performance of the\nGA-based AP selection scheme.",

However, efficient distributed solution techniques are\nrequired, especially for large-scale linear programs. This article describes a\nnew decomposition technique for systems of linear equations implemented in the\nparallel interior-point solver PIPS-IPM++. The algorithm exploits a matrix\nstructure commonly found in optimization problems: a doubly-bordered\nblock-diagonal or arrowhead structure. This structure is preserved in the\nlinear KKT systems solved during each iteration of the interior-point method.\nWe present a hierarchical Schur complement decomposition that distributes and\nsolves the linear optimization problem; it is designed for high-performance\narchitectures and scales well with the availability of additional computing\nresources. The decomposition approach uses the border constraints' locality to\ndecouple the factorization process. Our approach is motivated by large-scale\nunit commitment problems. We demonstrate the performance of our method on a set\nof mid-to large-scale instances, some of which have more than 10^9 nonzeros in\ntheir constraint matrix.",

In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive study that systematically explores the interplay of model\narchitectures, training recipes, and data curation strategies, culminating in a\nsimple and scalable text-image-conditioned video generation method, named STIV.\nOur framework integrates image condition into a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)\nthrough frame replacement, while incorporating text conditioning via a joint\nimage-text conditional classifier-free guidance.

PG first constructs the product automaton of the data graph and\nthe query and then uses breadth-first search to find the accepting states\nreachable from each initial state in the product automaton. Its data complexity\nis O(|V|.|E|), where V and E are the sets of vertices and respectively edges in\nthe data graph.

OSPG's complexity is\nat most that of PG and can be asymptotically smaller for small output and\nsparse input. The improvement of OSPG over PG is due to the unnecessary time\nwasted by PG in the breadth-first search phase, in case a few output pairs are\neventually discovered.

These nested integrals take the\nform $\\int f\\left(\\int g(\\bs{y},\\bs{x})\\di{}\\bs{x}\\right)\\di{}\\bs{y}$, for\nnonlinear $f$, making them computationally challenging, particularly in\nhigh-dimensional settings. Although widely used for single integrals,\ntraditional Monte Carlo (MC) methods can be inefficient when encountering\ncomplexities of nested integration. This work introduces a novel multilevel\nestimator, combining deterministic and randomized quasi-MC (rQMC) methods to\nhandle nested integration problems efficiently. In this context, the inner\nnumber of samples and the discretization accuracy of the inner integrand\nevaluation constitute the level. We provide a comprehensive theoretical\nanalysis of the estimator, deriving error bounds demonstrating significant\nreductions in bias and variance compared with standard methods. The proposed\nestimator is particularly effective in scenarios where the integrand is\nevaluated approximately, as it adapts to different levels of resolution without\ncompromising precision. We verify the performance of our method via numerical\nexperiments, focusing on estimating the expected information gain of\nexperiments. When applied to Gaussian noise in the experiment, a truncation\nscheme ensures finite error bounds at the same computational complexity as in\nthe bounded noise case up to multiplicative logarithmic terms. The results\nreveal that the proposed multilevel rQMC estimator outperforms existing MC and\nrQMC approaches, offering a substantial reduction in computational costs and\noffering a powerful tool for practitioners dealing with complex, nested\nintegration problems across various domains.",

The generation and control of light polarization by metasurfaces\nalready provided a route towards ultracompact polarimetry devices in the linear\nregime. If translated to the nonlinear optical regime it may become a\nkey-enabling tool in nonlinear imaging, optical holography and sensing. Here,\nwe report the experimental ultrafast all-optical polarization modulation of\nupconverted light by all-dielectric metasurfaces via nonlinear interferometry.\nBy controlling the relative phase between a pump beam at $\\omega$ and its\nfrequency-double replica at 2$\\omega$, we can set the phase relation between\ntwo frequency-degenerate upconverted processes at 3$\\omega$ $-$ Sum-Frequency\nGeneration (SFG) and Third-Harmonic Generation (THG) $-$ stemming from an\nAlGaAs metasurface. By exploiting the opposite parity of the two nonlinear\nprocess and tuning their relative powers, we can achieve modulation of the\npolarization states of the light emitted at 3$\\omega$ between linear and\ncircular states with a degree of circular polarization (DOCP) up to 83$\\%$. In\nparticular, circularly polarized light features opposite handedness\nsymmetrically located in the Fourier space, at coincidence with the first\ndiffraction orders of the metasurface. Moreover, by toggling the phase delay by\n$\\pi$, the handedness can be fully switched between the diffraction.

    "abstract": "Citation recommendation systems have attracted much academic interest,\nresulting in many studies and implementations. These systems help authors\nautomatically generate proper citations by suggesting relevant references based\non the text they have written. However, the methods used in citation\nrecommendation differ across various studies and implementations.

Additionally, the datasets used in these studies\ninclude different aspects of papers, such as metadata, citation context, or\neven the full text of the paper in various formats and structures. The\ndiversity in models, datasets, and evaluation metrics makes it challenging to\nassess and compare citation recommendation methods effectively. To address this\nissue, a standardized dataset and evaluation metrics are needed to evaluate\nthese models consistently. Therefore, we propose developing a benchmark\nspecifically designed to analyze and compare citation recommendation models.\nThis benchmark will evaluate the performance of models on different features of\nthe citation context and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the models\nacross all these tasks, presenting the results in a standardized way. By\ncreating a benchmark with standardized evaluation metrics, researchers and\npractitioners in the field of citation recommendation will have a common\nplatform to assess and compare different models.

    "abstract": "Disparities in access to healthcare have been well-documented in the United\nStates, but their effects on electronic health record (EHR) data reliability\nand resulting clinical models are poorly understood. Using an All of Us dataset\nof 134,513 participants, we investigate the effects of access to care on the\nmedical machine learning pipeline, including medical condition rates, data\nquality, outcome label accuracy, and prediction performance. Our findings\nreveal that patients with cost constrained or delayed care have worse EHR\nreliability as measured by patient self-reported conditions for 78% of examined\nmedical conditions. We demonstrate in a prediction task of Type II diabetes\nincidence that clinical risk predictive performance can be worse for patients\nwithout standard care, with balanced accuracy gaps of 3.6 and sensitivity gaps\nof 9.4 percentage points for those with cost-constrained or delayed care. We\nevaluate solutions to mitigate these disparities and find that including\npatient self-reported conditions improved performance for patients with lower\naccess to care, with 11.2 percentage points higher sensitivity, effectively\ndecreasing the performance gap between standard versus delayed or\ncost-constrained care. These findings provide the first large-scale evidence\nthat healthcare access systematically affects both data reliability and\nclinical prediction performance. By revealing how access barriers propagate\nthrough the medical machine learning pipeline, our work suggests that improving\nmodel equity requires addressing both data collection biases and algorithmic\nlimitations.

Our calculation is underpinned by the\nlatest updates in the nuclear database, accounts for previously overlooked\nforbidden transitions, and incorporates advanced corrections for the beta\ndecay. This brand new geo-neutrino flux model, compared to the widely-used\nestimates from Enomoto, reveals notable distinction in the energy spectrum\nshape because of our comprehensive approach.

Furthermore, we show that for a natural class of initial\nconditions, the corresponding measure flow converges to one of the stationary\ndistributions, thus demonstrating that the sparse free energy acts as a global\nLyapunov function. Under mild additional conditions, in the case $\\kappa = 2$\nwe prove that the sparse free energy arises naturally as the renormalized limit\nof certain relative entropies. We exploit this characterization to prove a\nmodified logarithmic Sobolev inequality and establish an exponential rate of\nconvergence of the $2$-MLFE measure flow to its unique stationary distribution.",

In contrast, we show (both numerically and by providing an analytic\nestimation) that a broad enhancement - such as a plateau bounded by infrared\nand ultraviolet scales - produces a bimodal mass function, with a primary peak\nclose to the infrared scale. We find that the typical initial gravitational\npotential (compaction function), conditioned on meeting the threshold for\ncritical collapse, is generated by a thin spherical shell with infrared radius\nand a thickness comparable to the ultraviolet scale. This suggests a\nhigher-than-expected abundance of PBH originating from Type II initial\nfluctuations.

We discuss several possible\norigins for the transient radio emission in our sources and conclude that\nchanges in the accretion rate combined with low-power radio ejecta are the most\nprobable cause. This is the scenario we also propose for one of our sources,\n101841$-$13, which was independently identified as a candidate tidal disruption\nevent (TDE) based on its infrared variability. However, we cannot exclude that\n101841$-$13 or other sources in our sample are TDEs.",

Provided it does\nnot also couple to electrons, such a $Z^\\prime$ boson would be largely\ninvisible to an electroweak precision machine like FCC-ee or CEPC (up to small\nfinite 1-loop matching contributions that we quantify). We show that, while\nthis class of $Z^\\prime$ models can also evade tests of quark flavour\nviolation, the constraint of anomaly-cancellation implies that valence quarks,\nmuons, and taus are all charged under $U(1)_X$, with the up quark charge being\nnecessarily large. The conclusion holds even if one augments the SM by three\nright-handed neutrinos to try and absorb anomalies. This means such $Z^\\prime$\nbosons cannot simultaneously hide below the TeV scale from $pp \\to \\ell\\ell$\nDrell--Yan measurements at the LHC and, even if we entertain esoteric models in\nwhich the lepton charges are numerically very small, we cannot escape dijet\nsearches at the LHC. For equitable quark and lepton charges, $pp\\to\\ell\\ell$\nalready excludes such a $Z^\\prime$ up to $M/g \\gtrsim$ 10 TeV, with a reach of\n20 TeV expected by the end of the High-Luminosity LHC. The dijet bounds\ncurrently sit around 5 TeV, while sensitivity up to 10 TeV could be achieved at\nHL-LHC.

As\na result, awareness on the training needs of different communities is raised\nand teachers of uncertainty are supported in addressing their audiences' needs,\nin improving their uncertainty-specific pedagogical knowledge and by\nsuggestions for training materials and tools.\n  The three needs that are most commonly encountered in the communities\nrequiring an understanding of measurement uncertainty, are 1) to address a\ngeneral lack of training on measurement uncertainty, 2) to gain a better\noverview of existing training on measurement uncertainty in several\ncommunities, and 3) to deliver more training on specific technical topics\nincluding use of a Monte Carlo method for propagating probability distributions\nand treating multivariate measurands and measurement models.\n  These needs will serve to guide future developments in uncertainty training\nand will, ultimately, contribute to increasing the understanding of\nuncertainty.",

We determined the RV jitter in 239 M dwarfs from\nthe CARMENES survey that are predominantly of mid to late spectral type and\nsolar metallicity. We also investigated the correlation between stellar\nrotation and magnetic fields with RV jitter. The median jitter in the CARMENES\nsample is 3.1 m/s, and it is 2.3 m/s for stars with an upper limit of 2 km/s on\ntheir projected rotation velocities. We provide a relation between the stellar\nequatorial rotation velocity and RV jitter in M dwarfs based on a subsample of\n129 well-characterized CARMENES stars. RV jitter induced by stellar rotation\ndominates for stars with equatorial rotation velocities greater than 1 km/s. A\njitter floor of 2 m/s dominates in stars with equatorial rotation velocities\nbelow 1 km/s. This jitter floor likely contains contributions from stellar\njitter, instrumental jitter, and undetected companions. We study the impact of\nthe average magnetic field and the distributions of magnetic filling factors on\nthe RV jitter. We find a series of stars with excess RV jitter and distinctive\ndistributions of magnetic filling factors. These stars are characterized by a\ndominant magnetic field component between 2-4 kG. An RV jitter floor can be\ndistinguished from RV jitter induced by activity and rotation based on the\nstellar equatorial rotation velocity. RV jitter induced by activity and\nrotation primarily depends on the equatorial rotation velocity. This RV jitter\nis also related to the distribution of magnetic filling factors, and this\nemphasizes the role of the magnetic field in the generation of RV jitter.",

However, most state-of-the-art methods rely on deep learning techniques\nthat necessitate extensive in-lab data collection, posing challenges in\nacquiring sufficient data to develop robust models. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce a locomotor task set optimization strategy designed to identify a\nminimal, yet representative, set of tasks that preserves model performance\nwhile significantly reducing the data collection burden. In this optimization,\nwe performed a cluster analysis on the dimensionally reduced biomechanical\nfeatures of various cyclic and non-cyclic tasks.

Our cross-validation analysis\nacross subjects showed that the optimized task set-based model achieved a root\nmean squared error of 0.30$\\pm$0.05 Nm/kg. This performance was significantly\nbetter than using only cyclic tasks (p<0.05) and was comparable to using the\nfull set of tasks. Our results demonstrate the ability to maintain model\naccuracy while significantly reducing the cost associated with data collection\nand model training.

Despite the advancements, current data-driven AD\napproaches tend to concentrate on a single dataset and specific tasks,\nneglecting their overall capabilities and ability to generalize. To bridge\nthese gaps, we propose RoboTron-Drive, a general large multimodal model\ndesigned to process diverse data inputs, such as images and multi-view videos,\nwhile performing a broad spectrum of AD tasks, including perception,\nprediction, and planning. Initially, the model undergoes curriculum\npre-training to process varied visual signals and perform basic visual\ncomprehension and perception tasks. Subsequently, we augment and standardize\nvarious AD datasets to finetune the model, resulting in an all-in-one LMM for\nautonomous driving. To assess the general capabilities and generalization\nability, we conduct evaluations on six public benchmarks and undertake\nzero-shot transfer on three unseen datasets, where RoboTron-Drive achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across all tasks.

    "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a promising technique for ensuring\nlong-term security in communication systems. Unlike conventional key exchange\nmethods like RSA, which quantum computers could theoretically break [1], QKD\noffers enhanced security based on quantum mechanics [2]. Despite its maturity\nand commercial availability, QKD devices often have undisclosed implementations\nand are tamper-protected. This thesis addresses the practical imperfections of\nQKD systems, such as low and fluctuating Secret Key Rates (SKR) and unstable\nperformance. By applying theoretical SKR derivations to measurement data from a\nQKD system in Poland, we gain insights into current system performance and\ndevelop machine learning (ML) models to predict system behavior.\n  Our methodologies include creating a theoretical QKD model [2] and\nimplementing ML models using tools like Keras (TensorFlow [3]). Key findings\nreveal that while theoretical models offer foundational insights, ML models\nprovide superior accuracy in forecasting QKD system performance, adapting to\nenvironmental and operational parameters. This thesis highlights the\nlimitations of theoretical models and underscores the practical relevance of ML\nmodels for QKD systems.\n  Future research should focus on developing a comprehensive physical layer\nmodel capable of doing long-term forcasting of the SKR. Such a model could\nprevent an encryption system form running out of keys if the SKR drops\nsignificantly. In summary, this thesis establishes a foundational approach for\nusing ML models to predict QKD system performance, paving the way for future\nadvancements in SKR long-term predictions.",

This paper proposes a joint energy and data market focusing on the\nday-ahead retailer energy procurement problem with uncertain demand. The\nretailer can purchase differentially-private smart meter data from consumers to\nreduce uncertainty. The problem is modelled as an integrated forecasting and\noptimisation problem providing a means of valuing data directly rather than\nvaluing forecasts or forecast accuracy. Value is determined by the Wasserstein\ndistance, enabling privacy to be preserved during the valuation and procurement\nprocess.

However,\ntraditional machine learning (ML) approaches, which require extensive local\ntraining on sensitive datasets, pose substantial privacy risks and compliance\nchallenges with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\nand California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Existing privacy-preserving\ntechniques, such as anonymization, differential privacy, and federated\nlearning, address some concerns but face limitations in utility, scalability,\nand complexity. This paper introduces the Privacy-Preserving Zero-Shot Learning\n(PP-ZSL) framework, a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) in\na zero-shot learning mode. Unlike conventional ML methods, PP-ZSL eliminates\nthe need for local training on sensitive data by utilizing pre-trained LLMs to\ngenerate responses directly. The framework incorporates real-time data\nanonymization to redact or mask sensitive information, retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) for domain-specific query resolution, and robust\npost-processing to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. This\ncombination reduces privacy risks, simplifies compliance, and enhances\nscalability and operational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices have become central to advancements in\nspin-based quantum computing. However, the increasing complexity of modern QD\ndevices makes calibration and control -- particularly at elevated temperatures\n-- a bottleneck to progress, highlighting the need for robust and scalable\nautonomous solutions. A major hurdle arises from trapped charges within the\noxide layers, which induce random offset voltage shifts on gate electrodes,\nwith a standard deviation of approximately 83~\\si{\\milli\\volt} of variation\nwithin state-of-the-art present-day devices. Efficient characterization and\ntuning of large arrays of QD qubits depend on choices of automated protocols.\nHere, we introduce a physically intuitive framework for a bootstrapping,\nautonomous testing, and initialization system (BATIS) designed to streamline QD\ndevice evaluation and calibration. BATIS navigates high-dimensional gate\nvoltage spaces, automating essential steps such as leakage testing, formation\nof all current channels, and gate characterization in the presence of trapped\ncharges. For forming the current channels, BATIS follows a non-standard\napproach that requires a single set of measurements regardless of the number of\nchannels. Demonstrated at $1.3$~\\si{\\kelvin} on a quad-QD Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$\ndevice, BATIS eliminates the need for deep cryogenic environments during\ninitial device diagnostics, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing\nsetup times. By requiring only minimal prior knowledge of the device\narchitecture, BATIS represents a platform-agnostic solution, adaptable to\nvarious QD systems, which bridges a critical gap in QD autotuning.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-image generation have enabled the creation of\nhigh-quality images with diverse applications. However, accurately describing\ndesired visual attributes can be challenging, especially for non-experts in art\nand photography. An intuitive solution involves adopting favorable attributes\nfrom the source images. Current methods attempt to distill identity and style\nfrom source images. However, \"style\" is a broad concept that includes texture,\ncolor, and artistic elements, but does not cover other important attributes\nsuch as lighting and dynamics. Additionally, a simplified \"style\" adaptation\nprevents combining multiple attributes from different sources into one\ngenerated image. In this work, we formulate a more effective approach to\ndecompose the aesthetics of a picture into specific visual attributes, allowing\nusers to apply characteristics such as lighting, texture, and dynamics from\ndifferent images. To achieve this goal, we constructed the first fine-grained\nvisual attributes dataset (FiVA) to the best of our knowledge. This FiVA\ndataset features a well-organized taxonomy for visual attributes and includes\naround 1 M high-quality generated images with visual attribute annotations.\nLeveraging this dataset, we propose a fine-grained visual attribute adaptation\nframework (FiVA-Adapter), which decouples and adapts visual attributes from one\nor more source images into a generated one. This approach enhances\nuser-friendly customization, allowing users to selectively apply desired\nattributes to create images that meet their unique preferences and specific\ncontent requirements.",

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of LLMs due to their superior performance in\nvarious tasks, their high computational costs often lead potential users to opt\nfor the pretraining-finetuning pipeline. However, biases prevalent in manually\nconstructed datasets can introduce spurious correlations between tokens and\nlabels, creating so-called shortcuts and hindering the generalizability of\nfine-tuned models. Existing debiasing methods often rely on prior knowledge of\nspecific dataset biases, which is challenging to acquire a priori. We propose\nRAZOR (Rewriting And Zero-bias Optimization Refinement), a novel, unsupervised,\nand data-focused debiasing approach based on text rewriting for shortcut\nmitigation. RAZOR leverages LLMs to iteratively rewrite potentially biased text\nsegments by replacing them with heuristically selected alternatives in a\nshortcut space defined by token statistics and positional information. This\nprocess aims to align surface-level text features more closely with diverse\nlabel distributions, thereby promoting the learning of genuine linguistic\npatterns. Compared with unsupervised SoTA models, RAZOR improves by 3.5% on the\nFEVER and 6.5% on MNLI and SNLI datasets according to the F1 score.\nAdditionally, RAZOR effectively mitigates specific known biases, reducing\nbias-related terms by x2 without requiring prior bias information, a result\nthat is on par with SoTA models that leverage prior information. Our work\nprioritizes data manipulation over architectural modifications, emphasizing the\npivotal role of data quality in enhancing model performance and fairness.

Although many defense\nstrategies have been proposed, they often require access to the model's\ninternal structure or need additional training, which is impractical for\nservice providers using LLM APIs, such as OpenAI APIs or Claude APIs. In this\npaper, we propose a moving target defense approach that alters decoding\nhyperparameters to enhance model robustness against various jailbreak attacks.\nOur approach does not require access to the model's internal structure and\nincurs no additional training costs. The proposed defense includes two key\ncomponents: (1) optimizing the decoding strategy by identifying and adjusting\ndecoding hyperparameters that influence token generation probabilities, and (2)\ntransforming the decoding hyperparameters and model system prompts into dynamic\ntargets, which are continuously altered during each runtime. By continuously\nmodifying decoding strategies and prompts, the defense effectively mitigates\nthe existing attacks. Our results demonstrate that our defense is the most\neffective against jailbreak attacks in three of the models tested when using\nLLMs as black-box APIs. Moreover, our defense offers lower inference costs and\nmaintains comparable response quality, making it a potential layer of\nprotection when used alongside other defense methods.",

Our resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements at the Ir\n$L_3$-edge reveal a robust low-lying collective magnetic mode with an\nantiferromagnetic (AF) dispersion similar to the insulators Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and\nSr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$, albeit with a large gap and much larger linewidth. At higher\nenergies we find the spin-orbit exciton, also strongly broadened, but with an\ninverted dispersion and doubled periodicity that are controlled by the charge\nhopping. These results demonstrate that the AF paramagnon persists, somewhat\ncounterintuitively, far into the metallic regime of the insulator-metal\ntransition driven by the degree of confinement in the heterostructure. We\nconclude that these two excitations, which are contrasting but coexisting\nhallmarks of strong AF pseudospin and charge fluctuations in a\nspin-orbit-coupled Mott-Slater material, are properties intrinsic to the ground\nstate of semimetallic perovskite SrIrO$_3$.",

Discrepancies between\ntraining data and operating conditions result in faults that can lead to\ncatastrophic incidents. However, collecting vast amounts of context-sensitive\ndata, with broad coverage of possible operating environments, is prohibitively\ndifficult. Synthetic data generation techniques for DNN allow for the easy\nexploration of diverse scenarios. However, synthetic data generation solutions\nfor aerial vehicles are still lacking.\n  This work presents a data augmentation framework for aerial vehicle's\nperception training, leveraging photorealistic simulation integrated with\nhigh-fidelity vehicle dynamics. Safe landing is a crucial challenge in the\ndevelopment of autonomous air taxis, therefore, landing maneuver is chosen as\nthe focus of this work. With repeated simulations of landing in varying\nscenarios we assess the landing performance of the VTOL type UAV and gather\nvaluable data. The landing performance is used as the objective function to\noptimize the DNN through retraining. Given the high computational cost of DNN\nretraining, we incorporated Bayesian Optimization in our framework that\nsystematically explores the data augmentation parameter space to retrain the\nbest-performing models. The framework allowed us to identify high-performing\ndata augmentation parameters that are consistently effective across different\nlanding scenarios.

We created a\nsimple model of an ensemble of gas clouds in order to simultaneously predict\nthe HI column density and gas covering fraction of HI-rich absorbers based on\nobservations of the MgII rest-frame equivalent width in IFS spaxels. We first\ntest the model on the field with HI observations already available from the\nliterature, finding that we can recover HI column densities consistent with the\nprevious estimates (although with large uncertainties). We then use our\nframework to simultaneously predict the gas covering fraction, HI column\ndensity and total HI mass ($M_{\\rm{HI}}$) for both fields. We find that both of\nthe observed strong systems have a covering fraction of $\\approx70$% and are\nlikely damped Lyman $\\alpha$ systems (DLAs) with $M_{\\rm{HI}}>10^9\\ M_{\\odot}$.\nOur model shows that the typical MgII metrics used in the literature to\nidentify the presence of DLAs are sensitive to the gas covering fraction.\nHowever, these MgII metrics are still sensitive to strong HI, and can be still\napplied to absorbers towards gravitational arcs or other spatially extended\nbackground sources.

The\ncomputer code provides the likelihood of SMEFT Wilson coefficients based on\nprecision measurements of $W$ and $Z$ pole observables, interpolation formulas\nfor Standard Model predictions, and modular SMEFT parametrizations. SMEFT\npredictions including next-to-leading-order (NLO) effects in perturbative and\nSMEFT expansion are available and five alternative electroweak input parameter\nschemes are supported. The likelihood addresses shortcomings of previous\nformulations in the treatment of parametric uncertainties and can be\nstraightforwardly included in SMEFT fits of LHC data. The input parameter\nscheme dependence and role of NLO corrections is studied for the EWPD fit in\nthe SMEFT. Furthermore, the impact of recent ATLAS and CMS measurements - of\nthe $W$ boson mass and width, of the lepton flavour universality (LFU) of $W$\nbranching fractions, and the effective leptonic weak mixing angle - is\nanalyzed. A test of LFU that surpasses the precision of existing measurements\nis proposed based on the weak mixing angle measurement. Finally, an ATLAS\nDrell-Yan triple-differential cross-section measurement is reinterpreted in the\nSMEFT and combined with the EWPD likelihood. This analysis demonstrates the\nfeasibility of the LFU precision test, improves constraints on muon couplings\nwith respect to the world average, and determines a combination of the\nquark-coupling asymmetry parameters $A_u$ and $A_d$ with a precision comparable\nto that of the heavy flavour parameters $A_c$ and $A_b$.",

Our framework models the environment\nusing three state factors (prompt, search, and information states) with seven\nobservation modalities capturing quality metrics. By framing the agent's\nlearning through the free energy principle, we enable systematic exploration of\nprompt combinations and search strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this approach, with the agent developing accurate models of\nenvironment dynamics evidenced by emergent structure in observation matrices.\nAction selection patterns reveal sophisticated exploration-exploitation\nbehavior, transitioning from initial information-gathering to targeted prompt\ntesting.

In this work, we revisit the\nexisting offline MARL methods and show that in certain scenarios they can be\nproblematic, leading to uncoordinated behaviors and out-of-distribution (OOD)\njoint actions. To address these issues, we propose a new offline MARL\nalgorithm, named In-Sample Sequential Policy Optimization (InSPO).

Additionally, by thoroughly exploring\nlow-probability actions in the behavior policy, InSPO can well address the\nissue of premature convergence to sub-optimal solutions.

In\nthis work, we explore strategies for adapting the primarily English LLMs\n(Llama-2 and Llama-3) to Dutch, a language spoken by 30 million people\nworldwide yet often underrepresented in LLM development. We collect 104GB of\nDutch text ($32$B tokens) from various sources to first apply continued\npretraining using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), complemented with Dutch\nposttraining strategies provided by prior work. For Llama-2, we consider using\n(i) the tokenizer of the original model, and (ii) training a new,\nDutch-specific tokenizer combined with embedding reinitialization. We evaluate\nour adapted models, ChocoLlama-2, both on standard benchmarks and a novel Dutch\nbenchmark, ChocoLlama-Bench. Our results demonstrate that LoRA can effectively\nscale for language adaptation, and that tokenizer modification with careful\nweight reinitialization can improve performance. Notably, Llama-3 was released\nduring the course of this project and, upon evaluation, demonstrated superior\nDutch capabilities compared to our Dutch-adapted versions of Llama-2. We hence\napply the same adaptation technique to Llama-3, using its original tokenizer.\nWhile our adaptation methods enhanced Llama-2's Dutch capabilities, we found\nlimited gains when applying the same techniques to Llama-3. This suggests that\nfor ever improving, multilingual foundation models, language adaptation\ntechniques may benefit more from focusing on language-specific posttraining\nrather than on continued pretraining. We hope this work contributes to the\nbroader understanding of adapting LLMs to lower-resource languages, and to the\ndevelopment of Dutch LLMs in particular.",

Of special interest, are the schemes where several\ninteraction paths interfere with each other, bringing about the phase-sensitive\nmeasurement of detected radio fields. In the theoretical modeling of those\ncases, the common assumptions are often insufficient to determine the boundary\ndetection parameters, such as receiving bandwidth or saturation point, critical\nfor practical considerations of atomic sensing technology. This evokes the\nresurfacing of a long-standing problem on how to describe an atom-light\ninteraction in a fractured loop. In such a case, the quantum steady state is\nnot achieved even with constant, continuous interactions. Here we propose a\nmethod for modeling of such a system, basing our approach on the Fourier\nexpansion of a non-equilibrium steady state. The proposed solution is both\nnumerically effective and able to predict edge cases, such as saturation.\nFurthermore, as an example, we employ this method to provide a complete\ndescription of a Rydberg superheterodyne receiver, obtaining the boundary\nparameters describing the operation of this atomic detector.",

However, these conclusions rely on the common\nassumption that there is no interaction between different levels of KK modes.\nRecent experimental phenomena, such as flavor mixing in particles, suggest that\nsuch interactions should be taken into account. To address this, we propose an\n\\emph{Orthonormal Completeness Hypothesis} (OCH) for the basis functions used\nto expand the higher-dimensional field. By applying the OCH, we demonstrate\nthat the effective action of a free bulk U(1) gauge field is intrinsically\ngauge-invariant in brane models with codimension-\\(d\\) (\\(d \\geq 1\\)). This\neffective action suggests the existence of interactions between different\nlevels of KK modes, which can only be eliminated by choosing specific basis\nfunctions, provided the warp factors satisfy special commutation relations. In\ngeneral, such interactions are universally present. We show the numerical\ncalculations for these coupling coefficients in an interesting 6D brane world.\nThis method can be extended to fermion fields, and it is shown that\ninteractions between different levels of left- and right-handed KK modes exist,\nproviding new insights into phenomena such as flavor mixing.",

In the study of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), when implementing\nICL, researchers usually adopts the naive strategies like fixed demonstrations\nacross different samples, or selecting demonstrations directly via a\nvisual-language embedding model.

First, we\ndiscuss the retrieval strategies for a visual-language task, assuming an\nembedding model is given. And we propose to concate the image and text\nembeddings to enhance the retrieval performance. Second, we propose to re-rank\nthe demonstrations retrieved by the embedding model via the LVLM's feedbacks,\nand calculate a list-wise ranking loss for training the embedding model. Third,\nwe propose an iterative demonstration mining strategy to improve the training\nof the embedding model.

Recent studies have demonstrated that leveraging the\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, combined with Knowledge Graphs\nthat encapsulate extensive factual data in a structured format, robustly\nenhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, deploying such systems in\nreal-world scenarios presents challenges: the continuous evolution of\nnon-stationary environments may lead to performance degradation and user\nsatisfaction requires a careful balance of performance and responsiveness. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce a Multi-objective Multi-Armed Bandit\nenhanced RAG framework, supported by multiple retrieval methods with diverse\ncapabilities under rich and evolving retrieval contexts in practice. Within\nthis framework, each retrieval method is treated as a distinct ``arm''. The\nsystem utilizes real-time user feedback to adapt to dynamic environments, by\nselecting the appropriate retrieval method based on input queries and the\nhistorical multi-objective performance of each arm. Extensive experiments\nconducted on two benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly outperforms baseline methods in non-stationary settings while\nachieving state-of-the-art performance in stationary environments.

    "abstract": "In sequential decision-making environments, the primary approaches for\ntraining agents are Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Imitation Learning (IL).\nUnlike RL, which relies on modeling a reward function, IL leverages expert\ndemonstrations, where an expert policy $\\pi_e$ (e.g., a human) provides the\ndesired behavior. Formally, a dataset $D$ of state-action pairs is provided: $D\n= {(s, a = \\pi_e(s))}$. A common technique within IL is Behavior Cloning (BC),\nwhere a policy $\\pi(s) = a$ is learned through supervised learning on $D$.\nFurther improvements can be achieved by using an ensemble of $N$ individually\ntrained BC policies, denoted as $E = {\\pi_i(s)}{1 \\leq i \\leq N}$. The\nensemble's action $a$ for a given state $s$ is the aggregated output of the $N$\nactions: $a = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum{i} \\pi_i(s)$. This paper addresses the issue of\nincreasing action differences -- the observation that discrepancies between the\n$N$ predicted actions grow in states that are underrepresented in the training\ndata. Large action differences can result in suboptimal aggregated actions. To\naddress this, we propose a method that fosters greater alignment among the\npolicies while preserving the diversity of their computations. This approach\nreduces action differences and ensures that the ensemble retains its inherent\nstrengths, such as robustness and varied decision-making. We evaluate our\napproach across eight diverse environments, demonstrating a notable decrease in\naction differences and significant improvements in overall performance, as\nmeasured by mean episode returns.",

To resolve this ambiguity, we propose ViewDelta, a text\nconditioned change detection framework that uses natural language prompts to\ndefine relevant changes precisely, such as a single attribute, a specific set\nof classes, or all observable differences. To facilitate training in this\nparadigm, we release the Conditional Change Segmentation dataset (CSeg), the\nfirst large-scale synthetic dataset for text conditioned SCD, consisting of\nover 500,000 image pairs with more than 300,000 unique textual prompts\ndescribing relevant changes.

    "abstract": "Dynamic latent space models are widely used for characterizing changes in\nnetworks and relational data over time. These models assign to each node latent\nattributes that characterize connectivity with other nodes, with these latent\nattributes dynamically changing over time. Node attributes can be organized as\na three-way tensor with modes corresponding to nodes, latent space dimension,\nand time. Unfortunately, as the number of nodes and time points increases, the\nnumber of elements of this tensor becomes enormous, leading to computational\nand statistical challenges, particularly when data are sparse. We propose a new\napproach for massively reducing dimensionality by expressing the latent node\nattribute tensor as low rank. This leads to an interesting new nested exemplar\nlatent space model, which characterizes the node attribute tensor as dependent\non low-dimensional exemplar traits for each node, weights for each latent space\ndimension, and exemplar curves characterizing time variation. We study\nproperties of this framework, including expressivity, and develop efficient\nBayesian inference algorithms. The approach leads to substantial advantages in\nsimulations and applications to ecological networks.",

For example, empirical evidence suggests that water was delivered to\nthe Earth by hydrated planetesimals from distant regions of the Solar System.\nRecently, several morphologically inactive near-Earth objects (NEOs) were\nreported to experience significant nongravitational accelerations inconsistent\nwith radiation-based effects, and possibly explained by volatile-driven\noutgassing. However, these \"dark comets\" display no evidence of comae in\narchival images, which are the defining feature of cometary activity. Here we\nreport detections of nongravitational accelerations on seven additional objects\npreviously classified as inactive (doubling the population) that could also be\nexplainable by asymmetric mass loss. A detailed search of archival survey and\ntargeted data rendered no detection of dust activity in any of these objects in\nindividual or stacked images. We calculate dust production limits of $\\sim10$,\n$0.1$, and $0.1$ kg s$^{-1}$ for 1998 FR$_{11}$, 2001 ME$_{1}$, and 2003 RM\nwith these data, indicating little or no dust surrounding the objects during\nthe observations. This set of dark comets reveals the delineation between two\ndistinct populations: larger, \"outer\" dark comets on eccentric orbits that are\nend members of a continuum in activity level of comets, and smaller, \"inner\"\ndark comets on near-circular orbits that could signify a new population. These\nobjects may trace various stages in the life cycle of a previously undetected,\nbut potentially numerous, volatile-rich population that may have provided\nessential material to the Earth.",

    "abstract": "Heat transfer in liquids is a very challenging problem as it combines the\ncompeting effect of high frequency oscillations, which dominate liquid heat\ncapacity, and diffusive motion, which enables transport macroscopic flow. This\nissue is compounded by the relatively junior state of dynamical theories of\nliquid thermodynamics. Nevertheless, molten salts are playing an increasingly\nimportant role in industrial and energy applications and there is a pressing\nneed to understand the mechanisms behind their irreversible transport\nprocesses. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the heat\ntransport of three different molten salts: LiCl, KCl, and the eutectic point of\ntheir mixture. While all simulations consider the properties of the liquid\nwithin the frame of its centre of mass, we calculate different susceptibilities\nwhich implicitly include and explicitly exclude the heat carried by partial\nmass currents within this frame. We find that, while the heat advected by\npartial mass currents in the mixture increases with increasing temperature, the\nheat transferred by collective vibrational motion (phonons) decreases with\nincreasing temperature. This causes a maximum in the heat conductance with\ntemperature in the mixtures only - in pure salts each contribution decreases\nmonotonically with temperature. We attribute this anomaly to the extra freedom\nafforded to ionic motion in mixtures - in pure salts the motion of cations and\nanions is bound due to conservation of linear momentum. In mixtures, a coherent\nbut diffusive collective motion is enabled by the release of Li ions from this\ncondition by the introduction of a third species. We tentatively ascribe this\ncoherent collective motion to the ``diffusive\" phonons that have been used to\nexplain a similar anomaly in the thermal conductivity of solids.",

Among the proposed\ninterpretations, such excess has been explained by negligible dust attenuation\nconditions following radiation-driven outflows launched by young stars when a\ngalaxy goes through a super-Eddington phase. Dust opacity decreases the\nclassical Eddington luminosity by a (boost) factor $A$, thus favoring the\ndriving of outflows by stellar radiation in compact, initially dusty galaxies.\nHere, we compute $A$ as a function of the galaxy stellar mass, gas fraction,\ngalaxy size, and metallicity (a total of 8 parameters). We find that the main\ndependence is on metallicity and, for the fiducial model, $A \\sim\n1800(Z/Z_\\odot)/(1+N_{\\rm H}/10^{23.5}\\, {\\rm cm^2})$. We apply such results to\n20 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at $z \\gtrsim 10$ and evaluate their\nmodified Eddington ratio. We predict that three galaxies are in the outflow\nphase. Their outflows have relatively low velocities ($60 -100 \\,{\\rm km\\\ns^{-1}}$), implying that they are unlikely to escape from the system. For the\nremaining 17 galaxies that are not currently in the outflow phase, we calculate\nthe past evolution of the modified Eddington ratio from their star formation\nhistory.

Our framework is based on a powerful quantum Gutzwiller (QGW)\ndescription of the bosonic bath combined with diagrammatic field theory for the\nimpurity-bath interactions. By resumming a selected class of diagrams to\ninfinite order, a rich picture emerges where the impurity is dressed by the\nfundamental modes of the bath, which change character from gapped particle-hole\nexcitations in the MI to Higgs and gapless Goldstone modes in the SF. This\ngives rise to the existence of several quasiparticle (polaron) branches with\nproperties reflecting the strongly correlated environment. In particular, one\npolaron branch exhibits a sharp cusp in its energy, while a new ground-state\npolaron emerges at the $O(2)$ quantum phase transition point for integer\nfilling, which reflects the nonanalytic behavior at the transition and the\nappearance of the Goldstone mode in the SF phase. Smooth versions of these\nfeatures are inherited in the polaron spectrum away from integer filling\nbecause of the varying ``Mottness\" of the bosonic bath. We furthermore compare\nour diagrammatic results with quantum Monte Carlo calculations, obtaining\nexcellent agreement. This accuracy is quite remarkable for such a highly\nnon-trivial case of strong interactions between the impurity and bosons in a\nmaximally correlated quantum critical regime, and it establishes the utility of\nour framework. Finally, our results show how impurities can be used as quantum\nsensors and highlight fundamental differences between experiments performed at\na fixed particle number or a fixed chemical potential.",

    "abstract": "Motion artifacts present in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can seriously\ninterfere with clinical diagnosis. Removing motion artifacts is a\nstraightforward solution and has been extensively studied. However, paired data\nare still heavily relied on in recent works and the perturbations in k-space\n(frequency domain) are not well considered, which limits their applications in\nthe clinical field. To address these issues, we propose a novel unsupervised\npurification method which leverages pixel-frequency information of noisy MRI\nimages to guide a pre-trained diffusion model to recover clean MRI images.\nSpecifically, considering that motion artifacts are mainly concentrated in\nhigh-frequency components in k-space, we utilize the low-frequency components\nas the guide to ensure correct tissue textures. Additionally, given that\nhigh-frequency and pixel information are helpful for recovering shape and\ndetail textures, we design alternate complementary masks to simultaneously\ndestroy the artifact structure and exploit useful information. Quantitative\nexperiments are performed on datasets from different tissues and show that our\nmethod achieves superior performance on several metrics. Qualitative\nevaluations with radiologists also show that our method provides better\nclinical feedback. Our code is available at https://github.com/medcx/PFAD.",

    "abstract": "Story visualization, the task of creating visual narratives from textual\ndescriptions, has seen progress with text-to-image generation models.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose a new task: \\textbf{customized manga generation} and\nintroduce \\textbf{DiffSensei}, an innovative framework specifically designed\nfor generating manga with dynamic multi-character control. DiffSensei\nintegrates a diffusion-based image generator with a multimodal large language\nmodel (MLLM) that acts as a text-compatible identity adapter. Our approach\nemploys masked cross-attention to seamlessly incorporate character features,\nenabling precise layout control without direct pixel transfer. Additionally,\nthe MLLM-based adapter adjusts character features to align with panel-specific\ntext cues, allowing flexible adjustments in character expressions, poses, and\nactions. We also introduce \\textbf{MangaZero}, a large-scale dataset tailored\nto this task, containing 43,264 manga pages and 427,147 annotated panels,\nsupporting the visualization of varied character interactions and movements\nacross sequential frames.

This scaling\nbehavior has brought a great deal of attention, as it provides valuable\nguidance in the design and training of even larger models.\n  Taking inspiration from the scaling laws observed in training large language\nmodels, we explore similar principles for sequential recommendation.\n  We use the full Amazon Product Data dataset, which has only been partially\nexplored in other studies, and reveal scaling behaviors similar to those found\nin language models.

In particular, the self-organized formation of the\nbeta/gamma-Ga2O3 double polymorph structures was demonstrated recently [A.\nAzarov et al., Nat. Commun. 14, 4855 (2023)], paving the way for prospective\napplications of such structures in electronics. Consequently, determining the\nconduction band offset in such structures is crucial since it dictates the\nbehavior of conduction electrons at the interface and, consequently, the\npotential functionality of such interfaces. Thus, in this work, we calculate\nthe band offsets at the beta/gamma-Ga2O3 interface using density functional\ntheory in correlation with the data provided by the experimental atomistic\ninterface analysis. Specifically, to unravel the strain state of the\nbeta/gamma-Ga2O3 interface, nanoscale strain maps were recorded using\nhigh-resolution transmission electron microscopy. In its turn, theoretically,\nlineup potential and vacuum alignment methods were used to analyze the band\noffsets, with and without strain, at the beta/gamma-Ga2O3 interface.\nAltogether, the collected results suggest that the band offsets between the\nbeta and gamma phases are likely not exceeding a few hundred meV, remaining\nhighly sensitive to the strain state at the interface. At this end, we conclude\nthat even though the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the\nbeta/gamma interface is theoretically possible, the gradual strain\nrelaxation--if it occurs as a function of the distance from the\ninterface--poses a significant challenge, as it may shift the 2DEG localization\nor even reduce the overall probability of its formation.",

    "abstract": "Model inversion attacks pose a significant privacy threat to machine learning\nmodels by reconstructing sensitive data from their outputs. While various\ndefenses have been proposed to counteract these attacks, they often come at the\ncost of the classifier's utility, thus creating a challenging trade-off between\nprivacy protection and model utility. Moreover, most existing defenses require\nretraining the classifier for enhanced robustness, which is impractical for\nlarge-scale, well-established models. This paper introduces a novel defense\nmechanism to better balance privacy and utility, particularly against\nadversaries who employ a machine learning model (i.e., inversion model) to\nreconstruct private data. Drawing inspiration from data poisoning attacks,\nwhich can compromise the performance of machine learning models, we propose a\nstrategy that leverages data poisoning to contaminate the training data of\ninversion models, thereby preventing model inversion attacks.\n  Two defense methods are presented. The first, termed label-preserving\npoisoning attacks for all output vectors (LPA), involves subtle perturbations\nto all output vectors while preserving their labels. Our findings demonstrate\nthat these minor perturbations, introduced through a data poisoning approach,\nsignificantly increase the difficulty of data reconstruction without\ncompromising the utility of the classifier. Subsequently, we introduce a second\nmethod, label-flipping poisoning for partial output vectors (LFP), which\nselectively perturbs a small subset of output vectors and alters their labels\nduring the process. Empirical results indicate that LPA is notably effective,\noutperforming the current state-of-the-art defenses. Our data poisoning-based\ndefense provides a new retraining-free defense paradigm that preserves the\nvictim classifier's utility.",

As the\nindex $\\ell$ increases, the potential transitions from a harmonic trap when\n$\\ell = 1$ to a square-well potential for larger values of $\\ell$. This\ntransition allows us to study a range of soliton dynamics under different\nconfinement conditions while maintaining the same BEC volume. Through the\nderivation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) and under these specific\nconditions in both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D)\nconfigurations, we explore the dynamics of solitons across multiple scenarios.\nThe study examines two primary methods for solitons generation: the temporal\nmodulation of the scattering length and the implementation of an initial\npotential barrier that is subsequently removed. The results indicate that the\ntrap shape plays a critical role in the generation and interaction dynamics of\nsolitons. In harmonic traps, solitons exhibit a behavior different from those\nobserved in anharmonic traps, where the dynamics is significantly influenced by\nthe azimuthal index of the trap. The ability to control soliton dynamics in\nBECs holds significant promise for applications in quantum technologies,\nprecision sensing, and the exploration of fundamental quantum phenomena.",

Most existing works utilize\nhierarchical or long context models to process documents, which achieve coarse\nunderstanding but may ignore details. Some researchers construct a document\nview with similar sentences about aligned document subtopics to focus on\ndetailed matching signals. However, a long document generally contains multiple\nsubtopics. The matching signals are heterogeneous from multiple topics.\nConsidering only the homologous aligned subtopics may not be representative\nenough and may cause biased modeling. In this paper, we introduce a new\nframework to model representative matching signals. First, we propose to\ncapture various matching signals through subtopics of document pairs. Next, We\nconstruct multiple document views based on subtopics to cover heterogeneous and\nvaluable details. However, existing spatial aggregation methods like attention,\nwhich integrate all these views simultaneously, are hard to integrate\nheterogeneous information. Instead, we propose temporal aggregation, which\neffectively integrates different views gradually as the training progresses.\nExperimental results show that our learning framework is effective on several\ndocument-matching tasks, including news duplication and legal case retrieval.",

The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief\nTree (ABT) algorithm, an approximate sampling-based approach to solve POMDPs\nefficiently. We outline the POMDP formulation process, beginning with\ndiscretizing the highway topology to reduce problem complexity. Additionally,\nwe describe the dynamics and measurement models used to predict future states\nand establish the relationship between available noisy measurements and\npredictions. Building on our previous work, the dynamics model is expanded to\naccount for lateral movements necessary for lane changes during the merging\nprocess. We also define the reward function, which serves as the primary\nmechanism for specifying the desired behavior of the automated vehicle,\ncombining multiple goals such as avoiding collisions or maintaining appropriate\nvelocity. Our simulation results, conducted on three scenarios based on\nreal-life traffic data from German highways, demonstrate the method's ability\nto generate safe, collision-free, and efficient merging trajectories.

Clustering aggregation is a technique that mitigates the weaknesses\nof clustering algorithms, an important class of data science methods for\npartitioning datasets, and is widely employed in many real-world applications.\nBy expressing the clustering aggregation problem instances as a Maximum\nIndependent Set (MIS) problem and as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary\nOptimization (QUBO) problem, it was possible to solve them by leveraging the\npotential of Pasqal's Fresnel (neutral-atoms processor) and D-Wave's Advantage\nQPU (quantum annealer). Additionally, the designed clustering aggregation\nalgorithm was first validated on a Fresnel emulator based on QuTiP and later on\nan emulator of the same machine based on tensor networks, provided by Pasqal.\nThe results revealed technical limitations, such as the difficulty of adding\nadditional constraints on the employed neutral-atoms platform and the need for\nbetter metrics to measure the quality of the produced clusterings. However,\nthis work represents a step towards a benchmark to compare two different\nmachines: a quantum annealer and a neutral-atom quantum computer. Moreover,\nfindings suggest promising potential for future advancements in hybrid\nquantum-classical pipelines, although further improvements are needed in both\nquantum and classical components.",

We characterize magnetic fields across different\nevolutionary stages of a cold gaseous planet in terms of topology and strength.\nWe find the occurrence of a transition from multipolar to dipolar-dominated\ndynamo regime throughout the life of a Jovian planet.

A key challenge in these systems is that the same piezo device is\nused for actuation (generating ink droplets) and for sensing and, as a\nconsequence, sensing is only available when there is no actuation. The proposed\nFault Detection (FD) filter, based on the healthy model, uses the piezo\nself-sensing signal to generate a residual, while taking the above challenge\ninto account. The system is flagged as faulty if the residual energy exceeds a\nthreshold. Fault Isolation (FI) is achieved through linear regression or a\nk-nearest neighbors approach to identify the most likely fault category and\nvariant. The resulting hybrid Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) method\novercomes traditional limitations of model-based methods by isolating different\ntypes of faults affecting the same entries (i.e., equations) in the ink channel\ndynamics.

In this study, we conducted\na preliminary investigation using various visualization techniques to explore\nendogenous biases. Our findings demonstrate the potentials of visual analytics\nto uncover hidden biases and identify associated issues. Additionally, we\nsynthesized these visualization strategies into a framework that approximates a\nmethod for detecting endogenous biases. Through this work, we advocate for the\nintegration of visualization at three critical stages of spatial analysis in\norder to minimize errors, address ethical concerns, and reduce\nmisinterpretations associated with endogenous biases.",

The\nspin-polarized current can undergo a $0-\\pi$-transition, resulting in an\nin-plane, strain-induced magnetization that switches sign as a function of the\nstrain.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a thin film thickness gauge based on the interferometric\nprinciple of Y-shaped optical fiber is proposed to achieve accurate measurement\nof film thickness. In this paper, the optical fiber, the interferometric\nprinciple and the film thickness calculation principle are introduced, and the\ninterferometric thickness measurement system based on Y-shaped optical fiber is\nconstructed. The system uses the special structure of Y-shaped optical fiber to\ntransmit the optical signal generated by the light source to the surface of the\nthin film, and obtains coherent optical signals of different wavelengths\nthrough reflection and interference. The spectrometer is used to receive and\ninterpret these interference signals, and the thickness of the film is\ncalculated according to the wavelength difference of the peak positions of the\nadjacent stages, combined with the refractive index of the film. In the\nspecific design, the paper elaborates on the design of each part of the\ninstrument, including the selection and parameter setting of the light source,\nY-fiber and spectrometer. Among them, the Y-shaped optical fiber, as the core\ncomponent of the instrument, has the function of transmitting optical signals\nand detecting optical signals on the surface of thin films. At the same time,\nthe paper also introduces the housing packaging and internal assembly process\nof the instrument to ensure the portability and stability of the instrument.\nThe results show that the thickness gauge has high measurement accuracy and\nstability, which can meet the needs of practical applications.",

Despite some limitations,\nmechanistic dynamic models are a popular approach to representing biological\nprocesses using ordinary differential equations where the parameters describe\nthe different development and survival rates. Recent advances in population\nmodelling have seen the combination of these mechanistic models with machine\nlearning. One approach is physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) whereby the\nmachine learning framework embeds physical, biological, or chemical laws into\nneural networks trained on observed or measured data. This enables forward\nsimulations, predicting system behaviour from given parameters and inputs, and\ninverse modelling, improving parameterisation of existing parameters and\nestimating unknown or latent variables. In this paper, we focus on improving\nthe parameterisation of biological processes in mechanistic models using PINNs\nto determine inverse parameters. In comparing mechanistic and PINN models, our\nexperiments offer important insights into the strengths and weaknesses of both\napproaches but demonstrated that the PINN approach generally outperforms the\ndynamic model. For a deeper understanding of the performance of PINN models, a\nfinal validation was used to investigate how modifications to PINN\narchitectures affect the performance of the framework. By varying only a single\ncomponent at a time and keeping all other factors constant, we are able to\nobserve the effect of each change.",

    "abstract": "LiDAR is widely used in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and\nautonomous driving. The LiDAR odometry is of great importance in multi-sensor\nfusion. However, in some unstructured environments, the point cloud\nregistration cannot constrain the poses of the LiDAR due to its sparse\ngeometric features, which leads to the degeneracy of multi-sensor fusion\naccuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time approach to\nsense and compensate for the degeneracy of LiDAR. Firstly, this paper\nintroduces the degeneracy factor with clear meaning, which can measure the\ndegeneracy of LiDAR. Then, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications\nwith Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method adaptively perceives the degeneracy with\nbetter environmental generalization. Finally, the degeneracy perception results\nare utilized to fuse LiDAR and IMU, thus effectively resisting degeneracy\neffects. Experiments on our dataset show the method's high accuracy and\nrobustness and validate our algorithm's adaptability to different environments\nand LiDAR scanning modalities.",

Although the existing 3D\nbackdoor attacks achieved high attack performance, they remain vulnerable to\npreprocessing-based defenses (e.g., outlier removal and rotation augmentation)\nand are prone to detection by human inspection. In pursuit of a more\nchallenging-to-defend and stealthy 3D backdoor attack, this paper introduces\nthe Stealthy and Robust Backdoor Attack (SRBA), which ensures robustness and\nstealthiness through intentional design considerations. The key insight of our\nattack involves applying a uniform shift to the additional point features of\npoint clouds (e.g., reflection intensity) widely utilized as part of inputs for\n3D DNNs as the trigger. Without altering the geometric information of the point\nclouds, our attack ensures visual consistency between poisoned and benign\nsamples, and demonstrate robustness against preprocessing-based defenses. In\naddition, to automate our attack, we employ Bayesian Optimization (BO) to\nidentify the suitable trigger. Extensive experiments suggest that SRBA achieves\nan attack success rate (ASR) exceeding 94% in all cases, and significantly\noutperforms previous SOTA methods when multiple preprocessing operations are\napplied during training.",

    "abstract": "DNA has been proposed as a chemical platform for computing and data storage,\npaving the way for building DNA-based computers. Recently, DNA has been\nhypothesized as an ideal quantum computer with the base pairs working as\nJosephson junctions. There are still major challenges to be overcome in these\ndirections, but they do not prevent deviceful perspectives of the main problem.\nThe present paper explores DNA base pairs as elementary units for a scalable\nnuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer (NMRQC). First, it presents an\noverview of the proton transfer (PT) mechanism during the prototropic\ntautomerism in the base pairs, scoring the current stage. Second, as a\nproof-of-principle, the paper examines these molecular structures as quantum\nprocessing units (QPUs) of a biochemical quantum device. For the model proposed\nhere, it is theoretically demonstrated that the nuclear spins involved in the\nPT of base pairs can be deterministically prepared in a superposition of\ntriplet states. Under appropriate conditions, the proton dynamics provides the\nminimal two-qubit entanglement required for quantum computing. The dynamics\nbetween the canonical and tautomeric quantum states (CQS and TQS, respectively)\nis determined from a thermally dependent Watson-Crick quantum superposition\n(WCQS); i.e., |WCQS> = a(T)|CQS> + b(T)|TQS> with |a(T)|^2 + |b(T)|^2 = 1. If\nthe DNA structure is sufficiently protected to avoid environment-induced\ndecoherence of the confined-proton quantum states, quantum information can be\nsuccessfully encoded in several base pairs along the coiled double strand. As a\npotential applicability, a crystalline DNA device could be employed for quantum\ncomputing and cryptography controlled by a sequence of Ramsey pulses. Finally,\nthis study critically evaluates these possibilities toward a proof-of-concept\nof a DNA-based quantum computer.",

Compared with its\nmulticlass counterpart, it is crucial to model the joint information among\nclasses. To this end, JointEnergy, which is a representative multi-label OOD\ninference criterion, summarizes the logits of all the classes. However, we find\nthat JointEnergy can produce an imbalance problem in OOD detection, especially\nwhen the model lacks enough discrimination ability. Specifically, we find that\nthe samples only related to minority classes tend to be classified as OOD\nsamples due to the ambiguous energy decision boundary. Besides, imbalanced\nmulti-label learning methods, originally designed for ID ones, would not be\nsuitable for OOD detection scenarios, even producing a serious negative\ntransfer effect. In this paper, we resort to auxiliary outlier exposure (OE)\nand propose an unknown-aware multi-label learning framework to reshape the\nuncertainty energy space layout. In this framework, the energy score is\nseparately optimized for tail ID samples and unknown samples, and the energy\ndistribution gap between them is expanded, such that the tail ID samples can\nhave a significantly larger energy score than the OOD ones.

For that purpose, one\ncan employ a particular phase-matching geometry or phase cycling, a procedure\nthat was adapted from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In optical\nmultidimensional spectroscopy, phase cycling has been usually carried out in a\n\"nested\" fashion, where pulse phases are incremented sequentially with linearly\nspaced increments. Another phase-cycling approach which was developed for NMR\nspectroscopy is \"cogwheel phase cycling,\" where all pulse phases are varied\nsimultaneously in increments defined by so-called \"winding numbers\". Here we\nexplore the concept of cogwheel phase cycling in the context of\npopulation-based coherent multidimensional spectroscopy. We derive selection\nrules for resolving and extracting fourth-order and higher-order nonlinear\nsignals by cogwheel phase cycling and describe how to perform a numerical\nsearch for the winding numbers for various population-detected 2D spectroscopy\nexperiments. We also provide an expression for a numerical search for nested\nphase-cycling schemes and predict the most economical schemes of both\napproaches for a wide range of nonlinear signals. The signal selectivity of the\ntechnique is demonstrated experimentally by acquiring rephasing and\nnonrephasing fourth-order signals of a laser dye by both phase-cycling\napproaches.

We suggest that high velocity destructive collisions (DCs) offer a\nnatural mechanism for depleting the mass inside the S2 orbit, thus allowing to\nreconcile the measured precession and the existence of a dense stellar cluster.\nSuch a solution is especially necessary when considering that stars are\nsupplied to the inner part of the cluster by both dynamical relaxation and by\nstars being captured in tight orbits during tidal disruption of binaries. We\nuse analytic arguments and results from simulations to demonstrate that in\norder to obtain a precession that is consistent with observations, collisional\ndepletion is necessary if the capture rate is greater than a few $10^{-6}\nyr^{-1}$. We also show that fluctuations arising from the finite number of\nstars cannot serve as an alternative to DCs for generating consistency with the\nobserved S2 precession. We conclude that astrometric observations of the\nS-stars provide a meaningful indication that the inner part of our galactic\ncenter is shaped by collisional depletion, supporting the hypothesis that DCs\noccur in galactic nuclei at an astrophysically significant rate.",

The acoustic pressure field is modeled by\nWestervelt's quasilinear wave equation to adequately capture the nonlinear\neffects in ultrasound propagation. The nonlocal attenuation characteristic for\nsoft biological media is modeled by acoustic damping of the time-fractional\ntype. Additionally, acoustic medium parameters are allowed to depend on the\ntemperature of the medium. The wave equation is coupled to the nonlinear Pennes\nheat equation with a pressure-dependent source to account for ultrasound waves\nheating up the tissue. Finally, the drug concentration is obtained as the\nsolution to an advection-diffusion equation with a pressure-dependent velocity.\nToward gaining a rigorous understanding of this system, we set up a fixed-point\nargument in the analysis combined with devising energy estimates that can\naccommodate the time-fractional damping. The energy arguments are, in part,\ncarried out by employing time-weighted test functions to reduce the regularity\nassumptions on the initial temperature. The analysis reveals that different\nsmoothness of the initial pressure, temperature, and concentration fields is\nneeded as well as smallness of the pressure-temperature data in order to ensure\nnon-degeneracy of the system and establish well-posedness.

This orthogonal frequency-division multiplexed (OFDM) signal will\nemulate an on-off keying (OOK) modulation to enable very low-energy envelope\ndetection at the receiver. Higher rate LP-WUS, containing multiple OOK symbols\nwithin single OFDM symbol, will be generated using the time-domain pulse\nmultiplexing of discrete Fourier transform spread (DFT-s-) OFDM. In this\ncontext, this paper presents a comprehensive signal design framework for\nDFT-s-OFDM-based OOK generation. General properties of subcarrier coefficients\nare derived demonstrating that only DFT of the bits needs to be computed online\nand repeated over the band before applying appropriate frequency-domain\nprocessing. The conventional approach of generating rectangular-like OOK\nwaveforms is then addressed by a combination of pre-DFT bit-spreading and\npost-DFT processing; and the least-squares (LS) method from Mazloum and Edfors,\nproposed for 5G LP-WUS and also Ambient-IoT, is shown to be implementable as\nsuch. Even though aesthetically pleasing and of independent interest,\nrectangular-like OOK waveforms are not optimal for 5G LP-WUS scenarios due to\ntheir limited robustness to channel frequency-selectivity and timing offset,\nand so shaping methods for spreading the OOK spectrum and concentrating the OOK\nsymbol energy are analyzed and shown to improve the bit error rate performance\nunder practical conditions.",

Generally, an autonomous vehicle is a special type of\nrobot that requires real-time, highly reliable sensor inputs due to functional\nsafety. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with a considerable number of sensors\nto provide different required sensor data to make the driving decision and\nshare with other surrounding vehicles. The inclusion of Data Distribution\nService(DDS) as a communication middleware in ROS2 has proved its potential\ncapability to be a reliable real-time distributed system. DDS comes with a\nscoping mechanism known as domain. Whenever a ROS2 process is initiated, it\ncreates a DDS participant. It is important to note that there is a limit to the\nnumber of participants allowed in a single domain.\n  The efficient handling of numerous in-vehicle sensors and their messages\ndemands the use of multiple ROS2 nodes in a single vehicle. Additionally, in\nthe cooperative perception paradigm, a significant number of ROS2 nodes can be\nrequired when a vehicle functions as a single ROS2 node. These ROS2 nodes\ncannot be part of a single domain due to DDS participant limitation; thus,\ndifferent domain communication is unavoidable. Moreover, there are different\nvendor-specific implementations of DDS, and each vendor has their\nconfigurations, which is an inevitable communication catalyst between the ROS2\nnodes. The communication between vehicles or robots or ROS2 nodes depends\ndirectly on the vendor-specific configuration, data type, data size, and the\nDDS implementation used as middleware; in our study, we evaluate and\ninvestigate the limitations, capabilities, and prospects of the different\ndomain communication for various vendor-specific DDS implementations for\ndiverse sensor data type.",

Moreover, long sub-sequences within the same class accumulate\nintra-class variance, which adversely impacts FSAR performance. To solve these\nchallenges, we propose a Matryoshka MAmba and CoNtrasTive LeArning framework\n(Manta). Firstly, the Matryoshka Mamba introduces multiple Inner Modules to\nenhance local feature representation, rather than directly modeling global\nfeatures. An Outer Module captures dependencies of timeline between these local\nfeatures for implicit temporal alignment. Secondly, a hybrid contrastive\nlearning paradigm, combining both supervised and unsupervised methods, is\ndesigned to mitigate the negative effects of intra-class variance accumulation.\nThe Matryoshka Mamba and the hybrid contrastive learning paradigm operate in\ntwo parallel branches within Manta, enhancing Mamba for FSAR of long\nsub-sequence.

Developing effective strategies\nto enable LLMs to resist continuously evolving jailbreak attempts represents a\nsignificant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel defensive\nparadigm called GuidelineLLM, which assists LLMs in recognizing queries that\nmay have harmful content.

More\nimportantly, they suffer from high computational complexity due to the pruning\nstep required for handling dense Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). To enhance the\nscalability of score matching, we have developed a new parent-finding\nsubroutine for leaf nodes in DAGs, significantly accelerating the most\ntime-consuming part of the process: the pruning step. This improvement results\nin an efficiency-lifted score matching algorithm, termed Parent\nIdentification-based Causal structure learning for both i.i.d. and temporal\ndata on networKs, or PICK. The new score-matching algorithm extends the scope\nof existing algorithms and can handle static and temporal data on networks with\nweak network interference. Our proposed algorithm can efficiently cope with\nincreasingly complex datasets that exhibit spatial and temporal dependencies,\ncommonly encountered in academia and industry. The proposed algorithm can\naccelerate score-matching-based methods while maintaining high accuracy in\nreal-world applications.",

    "abstract": "This ia a review/research paper on anomalies applied to a bottom-up approach\nto standard model and gravity. It is divided in two parts. The first consists\nin a review proper of anomalies in quantum field theories. Anomalies are\nanalyzed according to three different methods: a perturbative one based on\nFeynman diagram, a non-perturbative one relying on the Schwinger-DeWitt\napproach and, third, the one hinging on the Atiyah-Singer family's index\ntheorem. The three methods are applied both to chiral gauge anomalies and trace\nanomalies. The fundamental distinction that our presentation leads to is\nbetween obstructive (O) and non-obstructive (NO) anomalies. The former are tied\nto the non-existence of fermion propagators, which fatally maim the\ncorresponding theory. In the second part we apply this analysis to the SM and\nvarious of its extensions immersed in a gravitational background, and find that\nthey all are plagued by a residual chiral trace anomaly. To completely\neliminate all kind of dangerous anomalies in SM-like theories we propose a\nsomewhat unconventional scheme, and exemplify it by means of an explicit model.\nThe latter is a left-right symmetric model. We embed it in a Weyl geometry to\nrender it conformal invariant. We then deal with some of its quantum aspects,\nin particular its even (NO) trace anomalies and the means to preserve its\nconfomal invariance at the quantum level. We briefly review renormalization and\nunitarity in the framework of similar models discussed in the existing\nliterature. Finally we present a possible (conjectural) application of the\nmodel to describe the junction between cosmology and quantum field theory.",

However, these methods typically\ndisrupt task-relevant primary semantics directly, which results in low\ndefensibility and detectability of the attack. In this paper, we propose an\nAdversarial Attack on High-level Semantics for Graph Neural Networks (AHSG),\nwhich is a graph structure attack model that ensures the retention of primary\nsemantics. By combining latent representations with shared primary semantics,\nour model retains detectable attributes and relational patterns of the original\ngraph while leveraging more subtle changes to carry out the attack. Then we use\nthe Projected Gradient Descent algorithm to map the latent representations with\nattack effects to the adversarial graph. Through experiments on robust graph\ndeep learning models equipped with defense strategies, we demonstrate that AHSG\noutperforms other state-of-the-art methods in attack effectiveness.\nAdditionally, using Contextual Stochastic Block Models to detect the attacked\ngraph further validates that our method preserves the primary semantics of the\ngraph.",

    "abstract": "Understanding nuclear effects is essential for improving the sensitivity of\nneutrino oscillation measurements. Validating nuclear models solely through\nneutrino scattering data is challenging due to limited statistics and the broad\nenergy spectrum of neutrinos. In contrast, electron scattering experiments\nprovide abundant high-precision data with various monochromatic energies and\nangles. Since both neutrinos and electrons interact via electroweak\ninteractions, the same nuclear models can be applied to simulate both\ninteractions. Thus, high-precision electron scattering data is essential for\nvalidating the nuclear models used in neutrino experiments. To enable this, the\nauthor has introduced a new electron scattering framework in the \\textsc{NEUT}\nneutrino event generator, covering two interaction modes: quasielastic (QE) and\nsingle pion production. \\textsc{NEUT} predictions of QE agree well with\nnumerical calculations, supporting the validity of this implementation. From\ncomparisons with \\textsc{NEUT} predictions and inclusive electron scattering\ndata, the momentum-dependent removal energy correction is derived, addressing\neffects beyond the plane wave impulse approximation. This correction is applied\nto neutrino interactions, observing significant changes in charged lepton\nkinematics.

    "abstract": "The present work proposes an alternative approach to the problem of the\nemergence of classicality. Typical approaches developed in the literature\nderive the classical behaviour of a quantum system from conditions that concern\nthe value of the parameters deemed responsible of non-classicality, like Planck\nconstant.\n  Our first step in addressing the problem is instead to identify the physical\norigin of non-classicality of quantum physics. Nowadays the deepest origin is\nidentified in the impossibility of a simultaneous consistent value assignment\nto every set of quantum observables. To attack this impossibility a concept of\n``evaluation'' is then introduced, which allows for a consistent value\nassignment to non-comeasurable observables whenever an established set of\nconditions is satisfied. It is shown that in the case of the motion of the\ncenter of mass of a large rigid body evaluations exist that realize a\nconsistent value assignment to both the position and the velocity of the center\nof mass of the body. In so doing emergence of classicality is explained by\novercoming the obstacles to the simultaneous value assignments that allow for a\nclassical description of the phenomenon. This result prompts to search for\nextensions and generalization of the approach.",

Conventionally, the qubit encoding in QAOA for the TSP describes\na tour using a sequence of nodes, where each node is written as a 1-hot binary\nvector. We propose to encode TSP tours by selecting edges included in the tour.\nRemoving certain redundancies, the number of required qubits can be reduced by\na linear factor compared to the aforementioned conventional encoding.\n  We examined implementations of both QAOA encoding variants in terms of their\napproximation quality and runtime. Our experiments show that for small\ninstances results are just as accurate using our proposed encoding, whereas the\nnumber of required classical optimizer iterations increases only slightly.",

In this paper, we propose a Dynamic\nEnsemble Reasoning paradigm, called DER to integrate the strengths of multiple\nLLM experts conditioned on dynamic inputs. Specifically, we model the LLM\nensemble reasoning problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), wherein an agent\nsequentially takes inputs to request knowledge from an LLM candidate and passes\nthe output to a subsequent LLM candidate. Moreover, we devise a reward function\nto train a DER-Agent to dynamically select an optimal answering route given the\ninput questions, aiming to achieve the highest performance with as few\ncomputational resources as possible. Last, to fully transfer the expert\nknowledge from the prior LLMs, we develop a Knowledge Transfer Prompt (KTP)\nthat enables the subsequent LLM candidates to transfer complementary knowledge\neffectively.

However,\nthe inherent class imbalance in credit card transaction datasets poses\nsignificant challenges for model performance. Although sampling techniques are\ncommonly used to address this imbalance, their implementation sometimes\nprecedes the train-test split, potentially introducing data leakage.\n  This study presents a comparative analysis of XGBoost's performance in credit\ncard fraud detection under three scenarios: Firstly without any imbalance\nhandling techniques, secondly with sampling techniques applied only to the\ntraining set after the train-test split, and third with sampling techniques\napplied before the train-test split. We utilized a dataset from Kaggle of\n284,807 credit card transactions, containing 0.172\\% fraudulent cases, to\nevaluate these approaches.\n  Our findings show that although sampling strategies enhance model\nperformance, the reliability of results is greatly impacted by when they are\napplied. Due to a data leakage issue that frequently occurs in machine learning\nmodels during the sampling phase, XGBoost models trained on data where sampling\nwas applied prior to the train-test split may have displayed artificially\ninflated performance metrics. Surprisingly, models trained with sampling\ntechniques applied solely to the training set demonstrated significantly lower\nresults than those with pre-split sampling, all the while preserving the\nintegrity of the evaluation process.",

Electric field\ninduced second harmonic generation (E-FISH) is a diagnostic able to obtain the\nelectric field with high temporal and spatial resolution, is considered\nnon-invasive and can be applied to almost any type of plasma with high\nsensitivity. However, the high power laser beam used as a probe in this\ntechnique, can interact with the gas and induce charges, which can subsequently\ninfluence the plasma. In this work, E-FISH is applied on non-thermal pulsed\nplasma jets in N2 flowing into atmospheric air. In these jets, ionization\nfronts propagate along the axis of the jet, which are highly reproducible and\nperiodic. This allows for phase resolved measurements. A nanosecond and a\npicosecond pulsed laser, both operating at 1064 nm, are used as sources. For\nthe first time, the obtained E-FISH signals measured with both lasers are\ncompared to each other. The results deviate significantly between the two\nlasers, which can be explained by laser induced guiding of the streamers. This\nis observed by taking ICCD images of the plasma trajectory. At the position\nwhere the plasma crosses the laser beam path, the plasma branches. This reveals\nthat E-FISH is also invasive under some conditions. The profiles obtained with\nthe picosecond laser are in good qualitative agreement with previous coherent\nRaman scattering-based four-wave mixing results on the same plasma source and\ntherefore the picosecond laser is considered non-invasive. In future E-FISH\nmeasurements, the influence of the laser beam on the E-FISH signal should be\ntaken into account to prevent changing the plasma behavior. By decreasing the\nlaser power or using a shorter laser pulse, successful measurements can be\nperformed.",

Here, we model a force-free Harris current sheet under\nsolar coronal conditions to investigate this coupling in the linear and\nnon-linear regimes. In the linear regime, we adopt the magnetohydrodynamic\nspectroscopy code Legolas to compare the current sheet under thermal and\nthermoresistive conditions, after which we initialise non-linear simulations\n(with MPI-AMRVAC) with the unstable, linear tearing and thermal perturbations\nobtained with Legolas. It is shown that part of the unstable thermal\nquasi-continuum adopts tearing properties in the linear stage, but that it is\nnot until the non-linear stage is reached that a true thermal 'runaway' effect\nleads to condensations inside tearing-induced flux ropes. Hence, the linear\nstage is governed by the dominant tearing instability whilst condensations form\ndue to tearing-thermal coupling in the non-linear stage. Our results imply that\nperturbing an equilibrium current sheet with the fastest growing linear mode\nskips the mode mixing phase in which the dominant instability traditionally\nemerges, and significantly reduces the time-scale to enter into the non-linear\nstage and thermal runaway process from its equilibrium configuration.",

    "abstract": "We study evaporation and precipitate formation mechanics of bacteria-laden\nliquid bridge using experimental and theoretical analysis. Aqueous suspension\nof motile and non-motile Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa\ntypically found in contaminated food and water were used in liquid bridge\nconfiguration between hydrophilic substrates. Using inverse logarithmic\nevaporation flux model, we study volume regression for cylindrical/catenoid\nvolume models with confinement distance as a parameter. For all confinement\ndistances, the regression is linear on normalizing both volume and time as in\nthe case of pure sessile drop. However, in normalized volume and dimensional\ntime space, we observe non-linearities as the evaporation time scales non\nlinearly with the confinement distance. The non-linearities were captured using\nthe catenoid model. The catenoid model conforms to the experimental volume\nregression data at all confinement distances, and the transient liquid bridge\ninterface evolution profile at high confinement distance. We also study the\nprecipitate pattern and bacterial distribution using micro/nano\ncharacterization techniques. We show the average precipitate pattern for both\nsessile and higher confinement distance resembles coffee ring type deposits\nalthough the underlying bacterial distribution differs. For lower confinement,\nwe observe pattern resulting from a combination of coffee ring effect,\nstick-slick motion, and thin film instability. The reduction in confinement\ndistance causes an altered bacterial agglomeration, resulting in a\nmulti-pattern network instead of a single circumferential edge deposition. We\nshow the aerial size of motile bacteria increases with decreasing confinement,\nwhereas the size for non-motile bacteria remains constant in the precipitate.",

In a second step, we present a general\nrepresentation of the meaning based on the interaction of constructions, frames\nand events. This framework opens the door to a processing mechanism for\nbuilding the meaning based on the notion of activation evaluated in terms of\nsimilarity and unification.

We discuss mechanisms from the aforementioned interactions for\nsourcing an initial axion field velocity $\\dot{\\theta_i}$ at redshifts $3\\leq\nz\\leq 10$, that will \"kick\" it into motion. Driven by this initial velocity the\naxion will first roll up in its potential, similar to \"freezing\" dark energy.\nAfter it has reached the pinnacle of its trajectory, it will start to roll\ndown, and behave as \"thawing\" quintessence. As a proof of concept we undertake\na combined fit to BAO, SN and CMB data at the background level. We find that a\nscenario with $\\dot{\\theta_i}=\\mathcal{O}(1) \\; m_a$, where $m_a$ is the axion\nmass, is slightly preferred over both $\\Lambda$CDM and the conventional\n\"thawing\" quintessence with $\\dot{\\theta_i}=0$.

Many of\nthese tables are derived from web sources or real-world scenarios, which\nrequire meticulous data preparation (or data prep) to ensure accurate\nresponses. However, preparing such tables for NL questions introduces new\nrequirements that extend beyond traditional data preparation. This\nquestion-ware data preparation involves specific tasks such as column\nderivation and filtering tailored to particular questions, as well as\nquestion-aware value normalization or conversion, highlighting the need for a\nmore nuanced approach in this context. Because each of the above tasks is\nunique, a single model (or agent) may not perform effectively across all\nscenarios. In this paper, we propose AutoPrep, a large language model\n(LLM)-based multiagent framework that leverages the strengths of multiple\nagents, each specialized in a certain type of data prep, ensuring more accurate\nand contextually relevant responses. Given an NL question over a table,\nAutoPrep performs data prep through three key components. Planner: Determines a\nlogical plan, outlining a sequence of high-level operations. Programmer:\nTranslates this logical plan into a physical plan by generating the\ncorresponding low-level code. Executor: Executes the generated code to process\nthe table.

This method has applications across medical imaging,\nmultiphase flow detection, and tactile sensing. However, solving EIT involves a\nnonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) derived from Maxwell's equations,\nposing significant computational challenges as an ill-posed inverse problem.\nExisting PINN approaches primarily address semi-inverse EIT, assuming full\naccess to internal potential data, which limits practical applications in\nrealistic, full-inverse scenarios. Our framework employs a forward CNN-based\nsupervised network to map differential boundary voltage measurements to a\ndiscrete potential distribution under fixed Neumann boundary conditions, while\nan inverse PINN-based unsupervised network enforces PDE constraints for\nconductivity reconstruction. Instead of traditional automatic differentiation,\nwe introduce discrete numerical differentiation to bridge the forward and\ninverse networks, effectively decoupling them, enhancing modularity, and\nreducing computational demands. We validate our framework under realistic\nconditions, using a 16-electrode setup and rigorous testing on complex\nconductivity distributions with sharp boundaries, without Gaussian smoothing.\nThis approach demonstrates robust flexibility and improved applicability in\nfull-inverse EIT, establishing a practical solution for real-world imaging\nchallenges.",

To ensure uniqueness of\nsolutions in the subgaussian setting, we explore two commonly used assumptions:\neither the subgaussian measurements satisfy a fourth-moment condition or the\ntarget signals exhibit non-peakiness. For each scenario, we introduce a novel\nspectral initialization method that yields robust initial estimates. Building\non this, we employ leave-one-out arguments to show that the classical Wirtinger\nflow algorithm achieves a linear rate of convergence for both real-valued and\ncomplex-valued cases, provided the sampling complexity $m\\ge O(n \\log^3 m)$,\nwhere $n$ is the dimension of the underlying signals.

Manual assessment against intricate sets of rules often leads to\nsignificant project delays and expenses. In response to these challenges, ARC\noffers a promising solution to improve efficiency and compliance in design\nwithin the construction sector. However, the main challenge of ARC lies in\ntranslating regulatory text into a format suitable for computer processing.\nCurrent methods for rule interpretation require extensive manual labor, thereby\nlimiting their practicality. To address this issue, our study introduces a\nnovel approach that decomposes ARC into two distinct tasks: rule information\nextraction and verification code generation. Leveraging generative pre-trained\ntransformers, our method aims to streamline the interpretation of regulatory\ntexts and simplify the process of generating model compliance checking code.\nThrough empirical evaluation and case studies, we showcase the effectiveness\nand potential of our approach in automating code compliance checking, enhancing\nthe efficiency and reliability of construction projects.",

Due to their massive size and the high costs\nassociated with training, LLMs are not suitable for frequent retraining.\nHowever, updates are necessary to keep them in sync with rapidly evolving human\nknowledge. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Compression\nMemory Training (CMT) method, an efficient and effective online adaptation\nframework for LLMs that features robust knowledge retention capabilities.\nInspired by human memory mechanisms, CMT compresses and extracts information\nfrom new documents to be stored in a memory bank. When answering to queries\nrelated to these new documents, the model aggregates these document memories\nfrom the memory bank to better answer user questions. The parameters of the LLM\nitself do not change during training and inference, reducing the risk of\ncatastrophic forgetting. To enhance the encoding, retrieval, and aggregation of\nmemory, we further propose three new general and flexible techniques, including\nmemory-aware objective, self-matching and top-aggregation. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on three continual learning datasets (i.e., StreamingQA,\nSQuAD and ArchivalQA) demonstrate that the proposed method improves model\nadaptability and robustness across multiple base LLMs (e.g., +4.07 EM & +4.19\nF1 in StreamingQA with Llama-2-7b).",

However,\nreal-time tracking in complex maritime environments is challenging due to\ndynamic camera movement, low visibility, and scale variation. Typically, object\ndetection methods combined with filtering techniques are commonly used for\ntracking, but they often lack robustness, particularly in the presence of\ncamera motion and missed detections. Although advanced tracking methods have\nbeen proposed recently, their application in maritime scenarios is limited. To\naddress this gap, this study proposes a vision-guided object-tracking framework\nfor USVs, integrating state-of-the-art tracking algorithms with low-level\ncontrol systems to enable precise tracking in dynamic maritime environments. We\nbenchmarked the performance of seven distinct trackers, developed using\nadvanced deep learning techniques such as Siamese Networks and Transformers, by\nevaluating them on both simulated and real-world maritime datasets. In\naddition, we evaluated the robustness of various control algorithms in\nconjunction with these tracking systems. The proposed framework was validated\nthrough simulations and real-world sea experiments, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in handling dynamic maritime conditions. The results show that\nSeqTrack, a Transformer-based tracker, performed best in adverse conditions,\nsuch as dust storms. Among the control algorithms evaluated, the linear\nquadratic regulator controller (LQR) demonstrated the most robust and smooth\ncontrol, allowing for stable tracking of the USV.",

Due to these issues, we introduce a novel Cross-Series\nMasking (CSM) Strategy for effectively learning MRI representation in a\nself-supervised manner. Specifically, CSM commences by randomly sampling a\nsubset of regions and series, which are then strategically masked. In the\ntraining process, the cross-series representation is learned by utilizing the\nunmasked data to reconstruct the masked portions. This process not only\nintegrates information across different series but also facilitates the ability\nto model both intra-series and inter-series correlations and complementarities.\nWith the learned representation, the downstream tasks like segmentation and\nclassification are also enhanced. Taking brain tissue segmentation, breast\ntumor benign/malignant classification, and prostate cancer diagnosis as\nexamples, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both public and\nin-house datasets.",

However, recent work has focused on training an additional fusion model\nto combine complete responses from multiple LLMs, failing to tap into their\ncollaborative potential to generate higher-quality responses. Moreover, as the\nadditional fusion model is trained on a specialized dataset, these methods\nstruggle with generalizing to open-domain queries from online users. In this\npaper, we propose SpecFuse, a novel ensemble framework that outputs the fused\nresult by iteratively producing the next segment through collaboration among\nLLMs. This is achieved through cyclic execution of its inference and\nverification components. In each round, the inference component invokes each\nbase LLM to generate candidate segments in parallel, and the verify component\ncalls these LLMs again to predict the ranking of the segments. The top-ranked\nsegment is then broadcast to all LLMs, encouraging them to generate\nhigher-quality segments in the next round. This approach also allows the base\nLLMs to be plug-and-play, without any training or adaptation, avoiding\ngeneralization limitations. Furthermore, to conserve computational resources,\nwe propose a model exit mechanism that dynamically excludes models exhibiting\npoor performance in previous rounds during each query response. In this way, it\neffectively reduces the number of model calls while maintaining overall\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Discovering and tracking communities in time-varying networks is an important\ntask in network science, motivated by applications in fields ranging from\nneuroscience to sociology. In this work, we characterize the celebrated family\nof spectral methods for static clustering in terms of the low-rank\napproximation of high-dimensional node embeddings. From this perspective, it\nbecomes natural to view the evolving community detection problem as one of\nsubspace tracking on the Grassmann manifold. While the resulting optimization\nproblem is nonconvex, we adopt a block majorize-minimize Riemannian\noptimization scheme to learn the Grassmann geodesic which best fits the data.\nOur framework generalizes any static spectral community detection approach and\nleads to algorithms achieving favorable performance on synthetic and real\ntemporal networks, including those that are weighted, signed, directed,\nmixed-membership, multiview, hierarchical, cocommunity-structured, bipartite,\nor some combination thereof. We demonstrate how to specifically cast a wide\nvariety of methods into our framework, and demonstrate greatly improved dynamic\ncommunity detection results in all cases.",

With this\nwork we aim to overcome this degeneracy by applying a newly developed Bayesian\nstatistic technique that can fit these three parameters simultaneously.\n  Multi-epoch optical spectra are used in combination with a Bayesian statistic\ntechnique to fit stellar properties based on a publicly available grid of\nsynthetic spectra of stellar atmospheres. The use of all of the multi-epoch\nobservations simultaneously allows the identification of binaries.\n  The stellar parameters for 34 OB stars within the core of NGC 346 are derived\nand presented here. By the use of both $\\mathrm{He}\\textsc{i}$ and\n$\\mathrm{He}\\textsc{ii}$ lines, the partial degeneracy between the stellar\nparameters of effective surface temperature, surface gravity, and projected\nrotational velocity is overcome.

Those cases include the Hammerstein plant with\ntypically a bilinear model representation based on polynomial or Fourier\nexpansion of its nonlinear element. Wiener plants induce actual nonlinearity in\nthe parameters, which further complicates the optimisation. Neural network\nmodels and related optimisers are, however, well-prepared to represent and\nsolve nonlinear problems. Unfortunately, the available data for nonlinear\nsystem identification might be too diverse to support accurate and consistent\nmodel representation. This diversity may refer to different impulse responses\nand nonlinear functions that arise in different measurements of (different)\nplants. We therefore propose multikernel neural network models to represent\nnonlinear plants with a subset of trainable weights shared between different\nmeasurements and another subset of plant-specific (i.e., multikernel) weights\nto adhere to the characteristics of specific measurements. We demonstrate that\nin this way we can fit neural network models to the diverse data which cannot\nbe done with some standard methods of nonlinear system identification. For\nmodel testing, the subset of shared weights of the entire trained model is\nreused to support the identification and representation of unseen plant\nmeasurements, while the plant-specific model weights are readjusted to\nspecifically meet the test data.",

For instance, when a moving car suddenly appears and is very\nclose to an autonomous vehicle because of the obstruction, it is quite\nnecessary for the autonomous vehicle to quickly and accurately predict the\nfuture trajectories of the car with limited observed trajectory locations. In\nlight of this, we focus on investigating the task of instantaneous trajectory\nprediction, i.e., two observed locations are available during inference. To\nthis end, we propose a general and plug-and-play instantaneous trajectory\nprediction approach, called ITPNet. Specifically, we propose a backward\nforecasting mechanism to reversely predict the latent feature representations\nof unobserved historical trajectories of the agent based on its two observed\nlocations and then leverage them as complementary information for future\ntrajectory prediction. Meanwhile, due to the inevitable existence of noise and\nredundancy in the predicted latent feature representations, we further devise a\nNoise Redundancy Reduction Former, aiming at to filter out noise and redundancy\nfrom unobserved trajectories and integrate the filtered features and observed\nfeatures into a compact query for future trajectory predictions. In essence,\nITPNet can be naturally compatible with existing trajectory prediction models,\nenabling them to gracefully handle the case of instantaneous trajectory\nprediction. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse and nuScenes datasets\ndemonstrate ITPNet outperforms the baselines, and its efficacy with different\ntrajectory prediction models.",

These effects can make\nup a sizable fraction of the noise budget. Thus, a charge management\nsystem(CMS) is essential in high-precise space-based missions. However, the\noperating environment for space charge control is full of uncertainties and\ndisturbances. TM charge tracking precision is negatively affected by many\nphysical parameters such as external charging rate, quantum yield, UV light\npower, etc. Those parameters are rarely measured and supposed to vary because\nof changes in solar activity, temperature, aging of electronic components and\nso on. The unpredictability and variability of these parameters affects the CMS\nperformance in long-term space missions and must be evaluated or eliminated.\nThis paper presents a simple physics-based model of the discharging process\nwith high charging/discharging rate based on the geometry of inertial sensors.\nAfter that, a disturbance observer sliding mode control (DOSMC) is proposed for\nthe CMS with parametric uncertainties and unknown disturbance to maintain the\nTM charge below a certain level and improve its robustness. The simulation\nresults show that the DOSMC is able to force the system trajectory coincides\nwith the sliding line, which depends neither on the parameters or disturbances.\nIn this way, the DOSMC can effectively ignore the parameter perturbation and\nexternal disturbances.

Herein, we\nperformed object kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) simulations on void evolution in\nFe-Cr alloys under neutron and ion irradiations, focusing on the effects of\ndose rate, irradiation particle type and temperature. Binary Collision\nApproximation and Molecular Dynamics are applied to obtain the cascade\nmorphology of ion irradiation in order to study the effect of spatial\ncorrelation of cascades along the ion track, which is considered as a\nsignificant difference between the neutron and ion irradiations. Systematic\nOKMC simulations were performed at a wide range of dose rate from $10^{-7}$ to\n$10^{-3}$ dpa/s and temperature from 300 to 500$^\\circ C$. Simulation results\nshow that both a higher dose rate and a lower temperature can lead to a higher\ndensity and a smaller average size of voids. High dose rate greatly promotes\nthe interaction frequency between small defects and inhibit the absorption of\nvacancies by one vacancy cluster, thus enhancing the nucleation of vacancy\nclusters. This dose rate effect explains the major difference of microstructure\nbetween fission neutron and heavy ion irradiation. High temperature enhances\nthe migration of small defects and the absorption of vacancies by vacancy\nclusters, and thus enlarge the vacancy clusters. The impact of irradiation\nparticle types that has influence on the primary knock-on atom spectrum and\ncascade morphology is less important to void evolution compared with dose rate\nand irradiation temperature. This work provides fundamental insights into the\ndifference in void evolution between fission neutron and heavy ion irradiations\nthat are important to the application of ion irradiations in study irradiation\neffects of nuclear materials.",

By optimizing the voltage sets\nwith quadratic programming, we experimentally confirmed that this DAC system\ncan achieve more than twice the secular frequency attainable when its output\nrange is restricted to +/-10 V, which is consistent with the fact that scaling\nall electrode voltages by a factor of 5 will scale the secular frequency by the\nsquare root of 5. Since the output range of many commercially available DACs is\ncommonly limited to +/-10 V, this increase is effective for ion shuttling\noperations, such as transport, split and merge.

Point clouds are sparse 3D spatial data, which\nsuggests that SNNs should be well-suited for processing them. However, when\napplying SNNs to point clouds, they often exhibit limited performance and fewer\napplication scenarios. We attribute this to inappropriate preprocessing and\nfeature extraction methods. To address this issue, we first introduce the Spike\nVoxel Coding (SVC) scheme, which encodes the 3D point clouds into a sparse\nspike train space, reducing the storage requirements and saving time on point\ncloud preprocessing. Then, we propose a Spike Sparse Convolution (SSC) model\nfor efficiently extracting 3D sparse point cloud features. Combining SVC and\nSSC, we design an efficient 3D SNN backbone (E-3DSNN), which is friendly with\nneuromorphic hardware. For instance, SSC can be implemented on neuromorphic\nchips with only minor modifications to the addressing function of vanilla spike\nconvolution. Experiments on ModelNet40, KITTI, and Semantic KITTI datasets\ndemonstrate that E-3DSNN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with\nremarkable efficiency.

To further explore this, in this paper, we derive and extend a\nconvolution expression of RIS cascaded channel model based on the previously\nproposed Geometry-based Stochastic Model (GBSM)-based RIS cascaded channels.\nThis model follows the 3GPP standard framework and leverages parameters such as\nangles, delays, and path powers defined in the GBSM model to more accurately\nreflect the smallscale characteristics of RIS multipath cascades. To verify the\naccuracy of this model, we conduct measurements of the TxRIS-Rx channel,\nTx-RIS, and RIS-Rx sub-channels in a factory environment at 6.9 GHz, using the\nmeasured data to demonstrate the models validity and applicability in\nreal-world scenarios. Validation with measured data shows that the proposed\nmodel accurately describes the characteristics of the RIS cascaded channel in\nterms of delay, angle, and power in complex multipath environments, providing\nimportant references for the design and deployment of RIS systems.",

A comparative study of the\noptical and spin properties of NVs created by ion implantation and chemical\nvapor deposition delta-doping is thus presented, combined with an investigation\non the impact of annealing in vacuum at different temperatures. In addition,\nnanopillars are fabricated with electron beam lithography and reactive ion\netching for enhanced photon collection efficiency. An extensive combination of\ncharacterization techniques is employed. Notably, the smallest nanopillars\npresent fluorescence enhancements of factor around 50, compared to the\nunstructured regions. Annealing is also demonstrated to increase the optical\ncontrast between the NVs' electronic states, the coherence and relaxation times\nboth in bulk as in pillars. Regarding the NV preparation technique, the\ndelta-doping is shown to create NVs with less lattice defects and strain\ncompared to implantation.",

The total focusing method~(TFM), which exploits such datasets,\nrelies on a delay and sum algorithm to sum up the signals on a pixel grid.\nHowever, TFM only uses the first arriving p-waves, making it challenging to\nsize complex-shaped defects. By contrast, more advanced methods such as reverse\ntime migration~(RTM) and full waveform inversion~(FWI) use full waveforms to\nreconstruct defects. Both methods compare measured signals with ultrasound\nsimulations. While RTM identifies defects by convolving forward and backward\nwavefields once, FWI iteratively updates material models to reconstruct the\nactual distribution of material properties. This study compares TFM, RTM, and\nFWI for six specimens featuring circular defects or Y-shaped notches.

We instruct an\nLLaMA2-13B model to generate counterspeech, experimenting with various\nconfigurations based on different contextual information and fine-tuning\nstrategies. We identify the configurations that generate persuasive\ncounterspeech through a combination of quantitative indicators and human\nevaluations collected via a pre-registered mixed-design crowdsourcing\nexperiment. Results show that contextualized counterspeech can significantly\noutperform state-of-the-art generic counterspeech in adequacy and\npersuasiveness, without compromising other characteristics. Our findings also\nreveal a poor correlation between quantitative indicators and human\nevaluations, suggesting that these methods assess different aspects and\nhighlighting the need for nuanced evaluation methodologies. The effectiveness\nof contextualized AI-generated counterspeech and the divergence between human\nand algorithmic evaluations underscore the importance of increased human-AI\ncollaboration in content moderation.",

In particular, we\nidentify specific multipartite entangled states that will always produce\ninseparability after superposition with an arbitrary completely product state.\nThus, these entangled states are unconditionally superposition-robust, and we\nrefer to this phenomenon as ``unconditional inseparability of superposition\" in\nmultipartite quantum systems. In this way, we complete the picture of\nunconditional inseparability of superposition which was introduced earlier for\nbipartite systems. We also characterize the superposition of a multipartite\npure entangled state with a pure bi-separable state. However, the present\nanalysis allows us to obtain a more general result, viz., there exists at least\none pure entangled state in any multipartite Hilbert space such that its\nsuperposition with an arbitrary completely product state always yields an\nentangled state. On the other hand, for any bipartite pure entangled state, if\nat least one of the subsystems is a qubit, then it is always possible to find a\nsuitable product state such that the superposition of the entangled state and\nthe product state produces a product state. In this way, we find a feature of\nmultipartite quantum systems which is in sharp contrast with that of bipartite\nones. We then show how unconditional inseparability of superposition can be\nuseful in exhibiting an indistinguishability property within the local\nunambiguous state discrimination problem.",

We present the Frame Representation Hypothesis, a\ntheoretically robust framework grounded in the Linear Representation Hypothesis\n(LRH) to interpret and control LLMs by modeling multi-token words. Prior\nresearch explored LRH to connect LLM representations with linguistic concepts,\nbut was limited to single token analysis.

To address these issues, we propose Fusion embedding for PGPIS using a\nDiffusion Model (FPDM).

The first stage involves training the fusion embedding of the source\nimage and target pose to align with the target image's embedding. In the second\nstage, the generative model uses this fusion embedding as a condition to\ngenerate the target image. We applied the proposed method to the benchmark\ndatasets DeepFashion and RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T, and conducted both\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance.

Since tabular data contains complex interdependencies among\nfeatures, it presents a unique challenge for adversarial samples which must\nmaintain coherence and respect these interdependencies to remain\nindistinguishable from benign data. Moreover, existing attack evaluation\nmetrics-such as the success rate, perturbation magnitude, and query count-fail\nto account for this challenge. To address those gaps, we propose a technique\nfor perturbing dependent features while preserving sample coherence. In\naddition, we introduce Class-Specific Anomaly Detection (CSAD), an effective\nnovel anomaly detection approach, along with concrete metrics for assessing the\nquality of tabular adversarial attacks. CSAD evaluates adversarial samples\nrelative to their predicted class distribution, rather than a broad benign\ndistribution. It ensures that subtle adversarial perturbations, which may\nappear coherent in other classes, are correctly identified as anomalies. We\nintegrate SHAP explainability techniques to detect inconsistencies in model\ndecision-making, extending CSAD for SHAP-based anomaly detection. Our\nevaluation incorporates both anomaly detection rates with SHAP-based\nassessments to provide a more comprehensive measure of adversarial sample\nquality.

To address this, we introduce\nConceptSearch, a novel function-search algorithm that leverages LLMs for\nprogram generation and employs a concept-based scoring method to guide the\nsearch efficiently. Unlike simplistic pixel-based metrics like Hamming\ndistance, ConceptSearch evaluates programs on their ability to capture the\nunderlying transformation concept reflected in the input-output examples. We\nexplore three scoring functions: Hamming distance, a CNN-based scoring\nfunction, and an LLM-based natural language scoring function. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of ConceptSearch, achieving a significant\nperformance improvement over direct prompting with GPT-4. Moreover, our novel\nconcept-based scoring exhibits up to 30% greater efficiency compared to Hamming\ndistance, measured in terms of the number of iterations required to reach the\ncorrect solution. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven program\nsearch when integrated with concept-based guidance for tackling challenging\ngeneralization problems like ARC.",

    "abstract": "We use a simple holographic model to discuss approaching the edge of the\nconformal window in strongly coupled gauge theories to draw lessons for lattice\nstudies. Walking gauge theories have a gap between the scale where they enter\nthe strong coupling regime and the scale of chiral symmetry breaking. We\nhighlight that there can also be a gap between the scale where the critical\nvalue of the quark anti-quark operator's anomalous dimension is passed and the\nscale of the condensate. This potentially makes identifying the edge of the\nconformal window in a lattice simulation with UV bare coupling below the fixed\npoint value on a finite lattice difficult. A resolution is to study the theory\nwith a coupling above the fixed point value at the UV cut off. Here we show\nthat an ``artefact\" phase with chiral symmetry breaking triggered at the UV cut\noff exists and lies arbitrarily close to the fixed point at the edge of the\nconformal window. We quantify the chance of a misidentification of a chiral\nsymmetry breaking theory as IR conformal. We also quantify where the artefact\nphase lies, tuned to the fixed point value. We use the latest lattice results\nfor SU(3) gauge theory with ten quark flavours in [Hasenfratz:2023wbr] as a\ntest case; we conclude their identification that the theory is in the conformal\nwindow is reliable.",

To systematically evaluate its security, we first formalize the\nclaims of previously proposed Y00 protocols, clarifying their achievements and\nlimitations. We then identify the structural vulnerability through an intuitive\nexplanation and rigorous formulation using maximum likelihood estimation. Our\nfindings demonstrate that Y00's structural weaknesses allow for the unique\ndetermination of the shared secret, leading to significant information leakage.\nUsing the \"Toy protocol\" as a reference model, we contextualize these results\nwithin the broader field of security technology. Furthermore, we generalize our\nfindings to a wider class of quantum-based stream cipher protocols, identifying\na fundamental security condition that Y00 fails to satisfy. This condition\nserves as a critical benchmark for ensuring the security of any stream cipher\nprotocol relying on physical states, whether quantum or classical.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nCounterFactual Multimodal Sentiment Analysis framework (CF-MSA) using causal\ncounterfactual inference to construct multimodal sentiment causal inference.\nCF-MSA mitigates the direct effect from unimodal bias and ensures heterogeneity\nacross modalities by differentiating the treatment variables between\nmodalities.

The limiting cases always involve an infinite resource cost,\ntypically machine complexity or time. Realistic state preparation takes into\naccount both a finite size of the machine and constraints on the operations we\ncan perform. In this work, we determine in full generality the optimal\noperation for a predominant quantum paradigm: state transformation under a\nsingle unitary operation upon a finite system, in the case where the\nobservables corresponding to the target (such as ground state probability) and\ncost (such as dissipation) commute.

As a major part of this energy consumption is due\nto users' workloads, it is evident that users need to be aware of the energy\nfootprint of their applications.

CEEMS has been designed to be extensible and it allows\nthe Data Center (DC) operators to easily define the energy estimation rules of\nuser workloads based on the underlying hardware. This paper explains the\narchitectural overview of CEEMS, data sources that are used to measure energy\nusage and estimate equivalent emissions and potential use cases of CEEMS from\noperator and user perspectives.

A rocky planet harboring such an ocean is likely to\ninteract tidally with its host star, planetary companions, or satellites. To\ndate, however, models of the tidal response and heat generation of magma oceans\nhave been restricted to the framework of weakly viscous solids, ignoring the\ndynamical fluid behavior of the ocean beyond a critical melt fraction. Here we\nprovide a handy analytical model that accommodates this phase transition,\nallowing for a physical estimation of the tidal response of lava worlds. We\napply the model in two settings: The tidal history of the early Earth-Moon\nsystem in the aftermath of the giant impact; and the tidal interplay between\nshort-period exoplanets and their host stars. For the former, we show that the\nfluid behavior of the Earth's molten surface drives efficient early Lunar\nrecession to ${\\sim} 25$ Earth radii within $10^4{-} 10^5$ years, in contrast\nwith earlier predictions. For close-in exoplanets, we report on how their\nmolten surfaces significantly change their spin-orbit dynamics, allowing them\nto evade spin-orbit resonances and accelerating their track towards tidal\nsynchronization from a Gyr to Myr timescale. Moreover, we re-evaluate the\nenergy budgets of detected close-in exoplanets, highlighting how the surface\nthermodynamics of these planets are likely controlled by enhanced, fluid-driven\ntidal heating, rather than vigorous insolation, and how this regime change\nsubstantially alters predictions for their surface temperatures.",

In addition,\na hypersonic waverider usually travels at varying speed during flight, and\ndeviating from the default speed designed in terms of a constant Mach number\noften creates difficulties in preserving the expected performance. Therefore,\nresearch on the design of variable-Mach-number waveriders considering\nequilibrium-gas effects is important for applications. In this paper, a design\nmethod for a variable-Mach-number osculating-curved-cone waverider (VMOCCW)\nconsidering equilibrium-gas effects is introduced, then the influences of\ndifferent gas models on the waverider design are studied by taking a VMOCCW\ndesigned with a linear Mach-number distribution as an example. Furthermore, a\nnew Mach-number distribution method is proposed by using a parameterized\nrational function, which is combined with different gas models to achieve\nVMOCCW design. For comparison, waveriders designed with quadratic concave and\nconvex increasing functions are also selected for comparison of their layouts\nand aerodynamic performances under design and off-design conditions. The\nresults show that waveriders designed with the equilibrium-gas model exhibit\ndifferences in geometric features (e.g., volume and volumetric efficiency) and\naerodynamic characteristics (e.g., lift-to-drag ratio and pitching moment\ncoefficient) compared to those designed with the ideal-gas model.

Effective evaluation metrics are\ncrucial for providing detailed performance insights, particularly in the\ntemporal domain.

We then study the validity and accuracy of the Born\napproximation specifically for the case of a point mass lens for which the\nexact analytical expression of the amplification factor is available.

    "abstract": "Understanding complex animal behaviors hinges on deciphering the neural\nactivity patterns within brain circuits, making the ability to forecast neural\nactivity crucial for developing predictive models of brain dynamics. This\ncapability holds immense value for neuroscience, particularly in applications\nsuch as real-time optogenetic interventions. While traditional encoding and\ndecoding methods have been used to map external variables to neural activity\nand vice versa, they focus on interpreting past data. In contrast, neural\nforecasting aims to predict future neural activity, presenting a unique and\nchallenging task due to the spatiotemporal sparsity and complex dependencies of\nneural signals. Existing transformer-based forecasting methods, while effective\nin many domains, struggle to capture the distinctiveness of neural signals\ncharacterized by spatiotemporal sparsity and intricate dependencies. To address\nthis challenge, we here introduce QuantFormer, a transformer-based model\nspecifically designed for forecasting neural activity from two-photon calcium\nimaging data. Unlike conventional regression-based approaches,\nQuantFormerreframes the forecasting task as a classification problem via\ndynamic signal quantization, enabling more effective learning of sparse neural\nactivation patterns. Additionally, QuantFormer tackles the challenge of\nanalyzing multivariate signals from an arbitrary number of neurons by\nincorporating neuron-specific tokens, allowing scalability across diverse\nneuronal populations. Trained with unsupervised quantization on the Allen\ndataset, QuantFormer sets a new benchmark in forecasting mouse visual cortex\nactivity. It demonstrates robust performance and generalization across various\nstimuli and individuals, paving the way for a foundational model in neural\nsignal prediction.",

    "abstract": "The rise of deep learning models in the digital era has raised substantial\nconcerns regarding the generation of Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content. Existing\ndefense methods primarily involve model fine-tuning and post-hoc content\nmoderation. Nevertheless, these approaches largely lack scalability in\neliminating harmful content, degrade the quality of benign image generation, or\nincur high inference costs. To address these challenges, we propose an\ninnovative framework named \\textit{Buster}, which injects backdoors into the\ntext encoder to prevent NSFW content generation. Buster leverages deep semantic\ninformation rather than explicit prompts as triggers, redirecting NSFW prompts\ntowards targeted benign prompts. Additionally, Buster employs energy-based\ntraining data generation through Langevin dynamics for adversarial knowledge\naugmentation, thereby ensuring robustness in harmful concept definition. This\napproach demonstrates exceptional resilience and scalability in mitigating NSFW\ncontent. Particularly, Buster fine-tunes the text encoder of Text-to-Image\nmodels within merely five minutes, showcasing its efficiency. Our extensive\nexperiments denote that Buster outperforms nine state-of-the-art baselines,\nachieving a superior NSFW content removal rate of at least 91.2\\% while\npreserving the quality of harmless images.",

In the GA, we distinguish between Euclidean and\nRiemannian gradients. For the SO, we derive a concave lower bound for the\nthroughput and maximize it sequentially applying SDR.

With the success of large language models, there is a growing\nbody of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still\nleave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full\nEEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between\nall EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal\ndependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of\nEEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited\ngeneralizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats\nof EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a\ncriss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural\ncharacteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal\ndependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we\nutilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode\npositional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with\ndiverse formats.

    "abstract": "It is well-established that compactifying type I string theory on a circle \\(\nS^{(1)} \\) transforms the theory under T-duality into type I' theory, the\ncompactification of type IIA string theory on the orbifold \\(\n\\tilde{S}^{(1)}/\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), where the \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) action combines\nworldsheet parity with spacetime reflection along the dual circle \\(\n\\tilde{S}^{(1)} \\). We propose that, upon compactification, the untwisted\n(twisted) sector of the type I effective action should map under the Buscher\nrules to the untwisted (twisted) sector of the type I' effective action. This\nT-duality constraint offers significant insight into the determination of\nbosonic couplings in the effective action of type IIA theories, specifically\nthose that remain after orbifold reduction, as well as in the untwisted sector\nof the type I effective action. However, its scope is limited and insufficient\nto fully determine the couplings within the twisted sectors of type I and type\nI' theories. Within this framework, we demonstrate that the leading\n2-derivative couplings in untwisted sector of type I and the 2-derivative\ncouplings in type IIA theory are uniquely determined, except for the\nChern-Simons term in type IIA, which is absent in the orbifold reduction.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive Action Counting (RAC) aims to count the number of repetitive\nactions occurring in videos. In the real world, repetitive actions have great\ndiversity and bring numerous challenges (e.g., viewpoint changes, non-uniform\nperiods, and action interruptions). Existing methods based on the temporal\nself-similarity matrix (TSSM) for RAC are trapped in the bottleneck of\ninsufficient capturing action periods when applied to complicated daily videos.\nTo tackle this issue, we propose a novel method named Hybrid Temporal Relation\nModeling Network (HTRM-Net) to build diverse TSSM for RAC. The HTRM-Net mainly\nconsists of three key components: bi-modal temporal self-similarity matrix\nmodeling, random matrix dropping, and local temporal context modeling.\nSpecifically, we construct temporal self-similarity matrices by bi-modal\n(self-attention and dual-softmax) operations, yielding diverse matrix\nrepresentations from the combination of row-wise and column-wise correlations.\nTo further enhance matrix representations, we propose incorporating a random\nmatrix dropping module to guide channel-wise learning of the matrix explicitly.\nAfter that, we inject the local temporal context of video frames and the\nlearned matrix into temporal correlation modeling, which can make the model\nrobust enough to cope with error-prone situations, such as action interruption.\nFinally, a multi-scale matrix fusion module is designed to aggregate temporal\ncorrelations adaptively in multi-scale matrices. Extensive experiments across\nintra- and cross-datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only\noutperforms current state-of-the-art methods but also exhibits robust\ncapabilities in accurately counting repetitive actions in unseen action\ncategories.

    "abstract": "This work is concerned with synthesizing safety controllers for discrete-time\nnonlinear systems beyond polynomials with unknown mathematical models using the\nnotion of k-inductive control barrier certificates (k-CBCs). Conventional CBC\nconditions (with k=1) for ensuring safety over dynamical systems are often\nrestrictive, as they require the CBCs to be non-increasing at every time step.\nInspired by the success of k-induction in software verification, k-CBCs relax\nthis requirement by allowing the barrier function to be non-increasing over k\nsteps, while permitting k-1 (one-step) increases, each up to a threshold\nepsilon. This relaxation enhances the likelihood of finding feasible k-CBCs\nwhile providing safety guarantees across the dynamical systems. Despite showing\npromise, existing approaches for constructing k-CBCs often rely on precise\nmathematical knowledge of system dynamics, which is frequently unavailable in\npractical scenarios. In this work, we address the case where the underlying\ndynamics are unknown, a common occurrence in real-world applications, and\nemploy the concept of persistency of excitation, grounded in Willems et al.'s\nfundamental lemma. This result implies that input-output data from a single\ntrajectory can capture the behavior of an unknown system, provided the\ncollected data fulfills a specific rank condition. We employ sum-of-squares\n(SOS) programming to synthesize the k-CBC as well as the safety controller\ndirectly from data while ensuring the safe behavior of the unknown system.

To fill this gap, we first examine the\ncurrent 'gold standard' in Machine Unlearning (MU), i.e., re-training the model\nafter removing the undesirable training data, and find it does not work in\nSGMs. Further analysis of score functions reveals that the MU 'gold standard'\ndoes not alter the original score function, which explains its ineffectiveness.\nBased on this insight, we propose the first Moderated Score-based Generative\nModel (MSGM), which introduces a novel score adjustment strategy that redirects\nthe score function away from undesirable data during the continuous-time\nstochastic differential equation process. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that MSGM significantly reduces the likelihood of generating\nundesirable content while preserving high visual quality for normal image\ngeneration.

Recent works\nintroduce CLIP to DG tasks due to its superior image-text alignment and\nzeros-shot performance. Previous methods either utilize full fine-tuning or\nprompt-learning paradigms to harness CLIP for DG tasks. Those works focus on\navoiding catastrophic forgetting of the original knowledge encoded in CLIP but\nignore that the knowledge encoded in CLIP in nature may contain domain-specific\ncues that constrain its domain generalization performance. In this paper, we\npropose a new perspective to harness CLIP for DG, i.e., attention head\npurification. We observe that different attention heads may encode different\nproperties of an image and selecting heads appropriately may yield remarkable\nperformance improvement across domains. Based on such observations, we purify\nthe attention heads of CLIP from two levels, including task-level purification\nand domain-level purification. For task-level purification, we design\nhead-aware LoRA to make each head more adapted to the task we considered. For\ndomain-level purification, we perform head selection via a simple gating\nstrategy. We utilize MMD loss to encourage masked head features to be more\ndomain-invariant to emphasize more generalizable properties/heads.

    "abstract": "The Transformer-based model have made significant strides in semantic\nmatching tasks by capturing connections between phrase pairs. However, to\nassess the relevance of sentence pairs, it is insufficient to just examine the\ngeneral similarity between the sentences. It is crucial to also consider the\ntiny subtleties that differentiate them from each other. Regrettably, attention\nsoftmax operations in transformers tend to miss these subtle differences. To\nthis end, in this work, we propose a novel semantic sentence matching model\nnamed Combined Attention Network based on Transformer model (Comateformer). In\nComateformer model, we design a novel transformer-based quasi-attention\nmechanism with compositional properties. Unlike traditional attention\nmechanisms that merely adjust the weights of input tokens, our proposed method\nlearns how to combine, subtract, or resize specific vectors when building a\nrepresentation. Moreover, our proposed approach builds on the intuition of\nsimilarity and dissimilarity (negative affinity) when calculating dual affinity\nscores. This allows for a more meaningful representation of relationships\nbetween sentences. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we\nconducted extensive experiments on ten public real-world datasets and\nrobustness testing. Experimental results show that our method achieves\nconsistent improvements.",

This task is essential\nfor reliable machine learning and a better understanding of their\ngeneralization capabilities. Among OOD detection methods, Outlier Exposure (OE)\nsignificantly enhances OOD detection performance and generalization ability by\nexposing auxiliary OOD data to the model. However, constructing clean auxiliary\nOOD datasets, uncontaminated by in-distribution (ID) samples, is essential for\nOE; generally, a noisy OOD dataset contaminated with ID samples negatively\nimpacts OE training dynamics and final detection performance. Furthermore, as\ndataset scale increases, constructing clean OOD data becomes increasingly\nchallenging and costly. To address these challenges, we propose Taylor Outlier\nExposure (TaylorOE), an OE-based approach with regularization that allows\ntraining on noisy OOD datasets contaminated with ID samples. Specifically, we\nrepresent the OE regularization term as a polynomial function via a Taylor\nexpansion, allowing us to control the regularization strength for ID data in\nthe auxiliary OOD dataset by adjusting the order of Taylor expansion. In our\nexperiments on the OOD detection task with clean and noisy OOD datasets, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms conventional\nmethods and analyze our regularization term to show its effectiveness.

Although sparsification can\nextract diverse submodels for diverse clients, most sparse FL works either\nsimply assign submodels with artificially-given rigid rules or prune partial\nparameters using heuristic strategies, resulting in inflexible sparsification\nand poor performance.

Furthermore, Prompt Upper\nConfidence Bound Variance (P-UCBV) is designed to adaptively determine sparse\nratios by learning the superimposed effect of diverse device capabilities and\nnon-IID data, aiming at resource self-adaptation with promising accuracy.\nExtensive experiments show that FedLPS outperforms status quo approaches in\naccuracy and training costs, which improves accuracy by 1.28%-59.34% while\nreducing running time by more than 68.80%.",

As a remedy, by introducing facial component priors, we present a\nnovel facial image colorization framework dubbed FCNet. Specifically, we learn\na decoupled color representation for each face component (e.g., lips, skin,\neyes, and hair) under the guidance of face parsing maps. A chromatic and\nspatial augmentation strategy is presented to facilitate the learning\nprocedure, which requires only grayscale and color facial image pairs. After\ntraining, the presented FCNet can be naturally applied to facial image\ncolorization with single or multiple reference images. To expand the\napplication paradigms to scenarios with no reference images, we further train\ntwo alternative modules, which predict the color representations from the\ngrayscale input or a random seed, respectively. Extensive experiments show that\nour method can perform favorably against existing methods in various\napplication scenarios (i.e., no-, single-, and multi-reference facial image\ncolorization).

In GAI-assisted writing,\nstudents can delegate core cognitive tasks (e.g., generating ideas and turning\nthem into sentences) to GAI while still producing high-quality essays. This\ncreates new challenges for teachers in assessing and supporting student\nlearning, as they often lack insight into whether students are engaging in\nmeaningful cognitive processes during writing or how much of the essay's\nquality can be attributed to those processes. This study aimed to help teachers\nbetter assess and support student learning in GAI-assisted writing by examining\nhow different writing behaviors, especially those indicative of meaningful\nlearning versus those that are not, impact essay quality. Using a dataset of\n1,445 GAI-assisted writing sessions, we applied the cutting-edge method,\nX-Learner, to quantify the causal impact of three GAI-assisted writing\nbehavioral patterns (i.e., seeking suggestions but not accepting them, seeking\nsuggestions and accepting them as they are, and seeking suggestions and\naccepting them with modification) on four measures of essay quality (i.e.,\nlexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, text cohesion, and linguistic\nbias). Our analysis showed that writers who frequently modified GAI-generated\ntext-suggesting active engagement in higher-order cognitive\nprocesses-consistently improved the quality of their essays in terms of lexical\nsophistication, syntactic complexity, and text cohesion. In contrast, those who\noften accepted GAI-generated text without changes, primarily engaging in\nlower-order processes, saw a decrease in essay quality. Additionally, while\nhuman writers tend to introduce linguistic bias when writing independently,\nincorporating GAI-generated text-even without modification-can help mitigate\nthis bias.",

In contrast to general text to image\nsynthesis, in fine-grained synthesis there is high similarity between images of\ndifferent subclasses, and there may be linguistic discrepancy among texts\ndescribing the same image. Recent Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), such\nas the Recurrent Affine Transformation (RAT) GAN model, are able to synthesize\nclear and realistic images from texts. However, GAN models ignore fine-grained\nlevel information. In this paper we propose an approach that incorporates an\nauxiliary classifier in the discriminator and a contrastive learning method to\nimprove the accuracy of fine-grained details in images synthesized by RAT GAN.\nThe auxiliary classifier helps the discriminator classify the class of images,\nand helps the generator synthesize more accurate fine-grained images. The\ncontrastive learning method minimizes the similarity between images from\ndifferent subclasses and maximizes the similarity between images from the same\nsubclass. We evaluate on several state-of-the-art methods on the commonly used\nCUB-200-2011 bird dataset and Oxford-102 flower dataset, and demonstrated\nsuperior performance.",

Furthermore, many RS image restoration approaches that use deep\nlearning are often criticized for their lacks of architecture transparency and\nmodel interpretability. To address these problems, we propose a novel\nprogressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet),\nto progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed\nbased on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, also Markov\nproperties of the high-order degradation process and Maximum a posteriori (MAP)\nestimation, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the\nunfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module\nfor image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module\nfor image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain\ndegradation learning, and a module for super-resolution. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both synthetic and\nreal remote sensing images.",

In contrast, a coarser $k$-point mesh significantly increases the\ndensity of states at the Fermi level, inducing a ferromagnetic instability that\nsatisfies the Stoner criterion. Moreover, our results show that the effect of\nSOC on both the geometric and electronic structures is minimal, with only a\nslight gap opening at the Dirac points, indicating a weak SOC influence in\nthese materials. Importantly, our DFT band structure calculations closely align\nwith angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data, reinforcing the notion of\nweak electron correlations in these kagome metals.

The complexity of accurately specifying the reward\nfunction is further amplified by the sequential nature of the task, the\nsparsity of learning signals, and the multifaceted aspects of the desired\nbehavior.\n  In this thesis, we survey the literature on effective reward specification\nstrategies, identify core challenges relating to each of these approaches, and\npropose original contributions addressing the issue of sample efficiency and\nalignment in deep reinforcement learning.

This paper proposes a novel\nSemCom approach to transmit digital signals by using the image as the carrier\nsignal. Specifically, the proposed approach encodes the digital signal as a\nbinary stream and maps it to mask locations on an image. This allows binary\ndata to be visually represented, enabling the use of existing model,\npre-trained Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are optimized for masked image\nreconstruction, as the SemCom encoder and decoder. Since MAE can both process\nand recover masked images, this approach allows for the joint transmission of\ndigital signals and images without incurring significant communication\noverheads. In addition, considering the mask tokens transmission encoded by the\nMAE still faces extra costs, we design a sparse encoding module at the\ntransmitter to encode the mask tokens into a sparse matrix, and it can be\nrecovered at the receiver. Thus, this approach simply needs to transmit the\nlatent representations of the unmasked patches and a sparse matrix, which\nfurther reduce the transmission overhead compared with the original MAE\nencoder. Simulation results show that the approach maintains reliable\ntransmission even in a high mask ratio of images.",

Monte Carlo Dropout is a\nwidely used technique for approximating predictive uncertainty by performing\nstochastic forward passes with dropout during inference. However, using static\ndropout rates across all layers and inputs can lead to suboptimal uncertainty\nestimates, as it fails to adapt to the varying characteristics of individual\ninputs and network layers. Existing approaches optimize dropout rates during\ntraining using labeled data, resulting in fixed inference-time parameters that\ncannot adjust to new data distributions, compromising uncertainty estimates in\nMonte Carlo simulations.\n  In this paper, we propose Rate-In, an algorithm that dynamically adjusts\ndropout rates during inference by quantifying the information loss induced by\ndropout in each layer's feature maps. By treating dropout as controlled noise\ninjection and leveraging information-theoretic principles, Rate-In adapts\ndropout rates per layer and per input instance without requiring ground truth\nlabels. By quantifying the functional information loss in feature maps, we\nadaptively tune dropout rates to maintain perceptual quality across diverse\nmedical imaging tasks and architectural configurations. Our extensive empirical\nstudy on synthetic data and real-world medical imaging tasks demonstrates that\nRate-In improves calibration and sharpens uncertainty estimates compared to\nfixed or heuristic dropout rates without compromising predictive performance.\nRate-In offers a practical, unsupervised, inference-time approach to optimizing\ndropout for more reliable predictive uncertainty estimation in critical\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Recent research on real-time object detectors (e.g., YOLO series) has\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of attention mechanisms for elevating model\nperformance. Nevertheless, existing methods neglect to unifiedly deploy\nhierarchical attention mechanisms to construct a more discriminative YOLO head\nwhich is enriched with more useful intermediate features. To tackle this gap,\nthis work aims to leverage multiple attention mechanisms to hierarchically\nenhance the triple discriminative awareness of the YOLO detection head and\ncomplementarily learn the coordinated intermediate representations, resulting\nin a new series detectors denoted 3A-YOLO. Specifically, we first propose a new\nhead denoted TDA-YOLO Module, which unifiedly enhance the representations\nlearning of scale-awareness, spatial-awareness, and task-awareness. Secondly,\nwe steer the intermediate features to coordinately learn the inter-channel\nrelationships and precise positional information. Finally, we perform neck\nnetwork improvements followed by introducing various tricks to boost the\nadaptability of 3A-YOLO. Extensive experiments across COCO and VOC benchmarks\nindicate the effectiveness of our detectors.",

    "abstract": "In modern chip design, placement aims at placing millions of circuit modules,\nwhich is an essential step that significantly influences power, performance,\nand area (PPA) metrics. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a\npromising technique for improving placement quality, especially macro\nplacement. However, current RL-based placement methods suffer from long\ntraining times, low generalization ability, and inability to guarantee PPA\nresults. A key issue lies in the problem formulation, i.e., using RL to place\nfrom scratch, which results in limits useful information and inaccurate rewards\nduring the training process. In this work, we propose an approach that utilizes\nRL for the refinement stage, which allows the RL policy to learn how to adjust\nexisting placement layouts, thereby receiving sufficient information for the\npolicy to act and obtain relatively dense and precise rewards. Additionally, we\nintroduce the concept of regularity during training, which is considered an\nimportant metric in the chip design industry but is often overlooked in current\nRL placement methods. We evaluate our approach on the ISPD 2005 and ICCAD 2015\nbenchmark, comparing the global half-perimeter wirelength and regularity of our\nproposed method against several competitive approaches. Besides, we test the\nPPA performance using commercial software, showing that RL as a regulator can\nachieve significant PPA improvements. Our RL regulator can fine-tune placements\nfrom any method and enhance their quality. Our work opens up new possibilities\nfor the application of RL in placement, providing a more effective and\nefficient approach to optimizing chip design.

    "abstract": "From the perspective of dynamic (control) systems over cubic matrices, this\npaper proposes some new products on cubic matrices and uses them to construct\nlinear and nonlinear control systems over cubic matrices. First, the t-product\nof cubic matrices is surveyed, and some algebraic properties are investigated.\nWhen t-product based dynamic (control) systems are considered, its two\nweaknesses are found as follows: (i) it has rigorous dimension restriction;\n(ii) it is unable to formulate nonlinear (control) systems. Then the dimension\nkeeping semi-tensor product (DK-STP) of cubic matrices is proposed, which\novercomes the aforementioned weaknesses. Unfortunately, all subsystems,\ncorresponding to every frontal slides, of a DK-STP based dynamic (control)\nsystem are decoupled, which makes it unsuitable for formulating systems with\ncoupled subsystems. Finally, the t-STP, a combination of t-product with DK-STP,\nis presented. The t-STP related algebraic structures over cubic matrices, such\nas group, ring, module, and Lie group/Lie algebra, etc. are investigated.\nFinally, t-STP based dynamic (control) systems over cubic matrices are\nobtained, and its application to hyper-networked evolutionary games is\ninvestigated.",

To tackle this, we propose Hero-SR, a one-step\ndiffusion-based SR framework explicitly designed with human perception priors.\nHero-SR consists of two novel modules: the Dynamic Time-Step Module (DTSM),\nwhich adaptively selects optimal diffusion steps for flexibly meeting human\nperceptual standards, and the Open-World Multi-modality Supervision (OWMS),\nwhich integrates guidance from both image and text domains through CLIP to\nimprove semantic consistency and perceptual naturalness.

The low-energy excitations of graphene are two-dimensional\nmassless Dirac fermions with opposite chiralities at the $\\pm$K valleys of the\ngraphene Brillouin zone.

Existing diffusion-based SR approaches typically\nutilize semantic information from degraded images and restoration prompts to\nactivate prior for producing realistic high-resolution images. However,\ngeneral-purpose pretrained diffusion models, not designed for restoration\ntasks, often have suboptimal prior, and manually defined prompts may fail to\nfully exploit the generated potential. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce RAP-SR, a novel restoration prior enhancement approach in pretrained\ndiffusion models for Real-SR. First, we develop the High-Fidelity Aesthetic\nImage Dataset (HFAID), curated through a Quality-Driven Aesthetic Image\nSelection Pipeline (QDAISP). Our dataset not only surpasses existing ones in\nfidelity but also excels in aesthetic quality. Second, we propose the\nRestoration Priors Enhancement Framework, which includes Restoration Priors\nRefinement (RPR) and Restoration-Oriented Prompt Optimization (ROPO) modules.\nRPR refines the restoration prior using the HFAID, while ROPO optimizes the\nunique restoration identifier, improving the quality of the resulting images.\nRAP-SR effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose models and the\ndemands of Real-SR by enhancing restoration prior. Leveraging the plug-and-play\nnature of RAP-SR, our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing\ndiffusion-based SR methods, boosting their performance.

This novel methodology is engineered to augment the\nefficacy of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in multiple-choice visual reasoning\ntasks. Diverging from conventional approaches that evaluate each option\nindependently, MM-PoE employs a dual-step scoring paradigm that initially\nidentifies and excludes implausible choices, subsequently concentrating on the\nmost probable remaining options. This method emulates human test-taking\nstrategies, where individuals typically eliminate clearly incorrect answers\nprior to selecting the optimal response. Our empirical evaluations, conducted\nacross three benchmark datasets, reveal that MM-PoE significantly improves both\nzero-shot and few-shot performance of contemporary state-of-the-art VLMs.\nCritically, this approach not only broadens the application of the elimination\nprocess to multi-modal contexts but also allows few-shot experiments, thereby\naddressing two principal limitations concerning usage of PoE only in zero-shot\nsettings and only with a language-only framework. As a result, MM-PoE not only\nrefines the reasoning capabilities of VLMs but also broadens their\napplicability to complex visual question-answering scenarios.

    "abstract": "Purpose: A reliable cancer prognosis model for clear cell renal cell\ncarcinoma (ccRCC) can enhance personalized treatment. We developed a\nmulti-modal ensemble model (MMEM) that integrates pretreatment clinical data,\nmulti-omics data, and histopathology whole slide image (WSI) data to predict\noverall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for ccRCC patients.\nMethods: We analyzed 226 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas Kidney Renal\nClear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-KIRC) dataset, which includes OS, DFS follow-up\ndata, and five data modalities: clinical data, WSIs, and three multi-omics\ndatasets (mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation). Separate survival models were\nbuilt for OS and DFS. Cox-proportional hazards (CPH) model with forward feature\nselection is used for clinical and multi-omics data. Features from WSIs were\nextracted using ResNet and three general-purpose foundation models. A deep\nlearning-based CPH model predicted survival using encoded WSI features. Risk\nscores from all models were combined based on training performance. Results:\nPerformance was assessed using concordance index (C-index) and AUROC. The\nclinical feature-based CPH model received the highest weight for both OS and\nDFS tasks. Among WSI-based models, the general-purpose foundation model (UNI)\nachieved the best performance. The final MMEM model surpassed single-modality\nmodels, achieving C-indices of 0.820 (OS) and 0.833 (DFS), and AUROC values of\n0.831 (3-year patient death) and 0.862 (cancer recurrence). Using predicted\nrisk medians to stratify high- and low-risk groups, log-rank tests showed\nimproved performance in both OS and DFS compared to single-modality models.\nConclusion: MMEM is the first multi-modal model for ccRCC patients, integrating\nfive data modalities. It outperformed single-modality models in prognostic\nability and has the potential to assist in ccRCC patient management if\nindependently validated.",

ASLR randomly shuffles\nprogram virtual addresses to prevent attackers from knowing the location of\nprogram contents in memory.

We systematically analyze\nexisting microarchitectural attacks and identify multiple leakage paths. Given\nthe vast attack surface exposed by ASLR, it is challenging to effectively\nprevent leaking the ASLR secret against microarchitectural attacks.\n  Motivated by this, we present Oreo, a software-hardware co-design mitigation\nthat strengthens ASLR against these attacks. Oreo uses a new memory mapping\ninterface to remove secret randomized bits in virtual addresses before\ntranslating them to their corresponding physical addresses. This extra step\nhides randomized virtual addresses from microarchitecture structures,\npreventing side channels from leaking ASLR secrets. Oreo is transparent to user\nprograms and incurs low overhead. We prototyped and evaluated our design on\nLinux using the hardware simulator gem5.",

Our study uses a\nmultidimensional approach to construct a neighborhood-level measure that\nexplores how multiple SDoH jointly impact care received for endometrial cancer\n(EC) patients in Massachusetts (MA). Using 2015-2019 American Community Survey\ndata, we implemented a Bayesian multivariate Bernoulli mixture model to\nidentify neighborhoods with similar SDoH features in MA. Five neighborhood SDoH\n(NSDoH) profiles were derived and characterized: (1) advantaged non-Hispanic\nWhite; (2) disadvantaged racially/ethnically diverse, more renter-occupied\nhousing with limited English proficiency; (3) working class, lower educational\nattainment; (4) racially/ethnically diverse and greater economic security and\neducational attainment; and (5) racially/ethnically diverse, more\nrenter-occupied housing with limited English proficiency. Based on residential\ninformation, we assigned these profiles to EC patients in the Massachusetts\nCancer Registry. We used these profile assignments as the primary exposure in a\nBayesian logistic regression to estimate the odds of receiving optimal EC care,\nadjusting for patient-level sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.\nNSDoH profiles were not significantly associated with receiving optimal EC\ncare. However, compared to patients assigned to Profile 1, patients in all\nother profiles had lower odds of receiving optimal care. Our findings\ndemonstrate how a flexible model-based clustering approach can account for the\ninterconnected and multidimensional nature of NSDoH in a practical and\ninterpretable way.

Despite prior work on longitudinal tracking of skin\nlesions in 3D total body photography, there are still several challenges,\nincluding 1) low accuracy for finding correct lesion pairs across scans, 2)\nsensitivity to noisy lesion detection, and 3) lack of large-scale datasets with\nnumerous annotated lesion pairs. We propose a framework that takes in a pair of\n3D textured meshes, matches lesions in the context of total body photography,\nand identifies unmatchable lesions.

Using these maps to\ndefine source/target signals over the template domain, we construct a flow\nfield aligning the mapped signals. The initial correspondence maps are then\nrefined by advecting forward/backward along the vector field. Finally, lesion\nassignment is performed using the refined correspondence maps. We propose the\nfirst large-scale dataset for skin lesion tracking with 25K lesion pairs across\n198 subjects. The proposed method achieves a success rate of 89.9% (at 10 mm\ncriterion) for all pairs of annotated lesions and a matching accuracy of 98.2%\nfor subjects with more than 200 lesions.",

We here extend this work to study the non-thermal emission\nprocesses and investigate whether such an environment is consistent with the\nobserved multi-wavelength spectrum. While the simulated broadband spectrum\nbased on the wind-MC environment is largely consistent with observations, we\nfind that such an environment predicts a harder gamma-ray spectrum than\nobserved due to the relatively low CSM density in the cavity interior of the\nMC. This difference can be at least partially attributed to the present\none-dimensional setup of the model which does not account for the clumpy and\nmulti-dimensional structure of the CSM. Our model provides predictions for the\nlong-term evolution of the broadband spectrum which can be used to further\nprobe Tycho's surrounding environment in the future, a key to resolving the\nlong-standing issue of type Ia supernova progenitor channels.",

One countermeasure is robust watermarking,\nwhich tracks image propagation by embedding copyright watermarks into carriers.\nUnfortunately, AST-generated images lose the structural and semantic\ninformation of the original style image, hindering end-to-end robust tracking\nby watermarks. To fill this gap, we propose StyleMark, the first robust\nwatermarking method for black-box AST, which can be seamlessly applied to art\nstyle images achieving precise attribution of artistic styles after AST.\nSpecifically, we propose a new style watermark network that adjusts the mean\nactivations of style features through multi-scale watermark embedding, thereby\nplanting watermark traces into the shared style feature space of style images.\nFurthermore, we design a distribution squeeze loss, which constrain content\nstatistical feature distortion, forcing the reconstruction network to focus on\nintegrating style features with watermarks, thus optimizing the intrinsic\nwatermark distribution. Finally, based on solid end-to-end training, StyleMark\nmitigates the optimization conflict between robustness and watermark\ninvisibility through decoder fine-tuning under random noise.

Previously, it\nwas a common procedure that one could measure all qubits in order to collect\nmeasurement outcomes, from which one can estimate amplitudes of given quantum\nstate.

More concretely, such outcomes are capable of constructing a system of\nnonlinear algebraic equations, and by classically solving them, we obtain\n$\\Tilde{a}_i$, which is the approximation to the corresponding amplitudes\n$a_i$, including both real and imaginary component. We then discuss our\nframework from a broader perspective. First, we show that estimating all (norms\nof) amplitudes to additive accuracy $\\delta$, i.e., $| |\\Tilde{a}_i - |a_i| |\n\\leq \\delta$ for all $i$, $\\mathcal{O}(4^n/\\delta^4)$ single-qubit measurements\nis sufficient.

For a generic model of Hopf-link semimetal that\ncaptures the linked-trivial phase transition, we figure out the phase shifts of\noscillation for all Fermi pockets in all magnetic-field directions, by\npresenting self-consistent results from the Fermi surface tomography, Landau\nfan diagram, and electrical resistivity. As the magnetic field is rotated, the\nphase shifts exhibit a unique pattern, which could help to identify Hopf links\nin real materials, such as those in Li$_2$NaN.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) is an emerging research topic that aims\nto understand and recognize human sentiment or emotions through multiple\nmodalities. However, in real-world dynamic scenarios, the distribution of\ntarget data is always changing and different from the source data used to train\nthe model, which leads to performance degradation. Common adaptation methods\nusually need source data, which could pose privacy issues or storage overheads.\nTherefore, test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are introduced to improve the\nperformance of the model at inference time. Existing TTA methods are always\nbased on probabilistic models and unimodal learning, and thus can not be\napplied to MSA which is often considered as a multimodal regression task. In\nthis paper, we propose two strategies: Contrastive Adaptation and Stable\nPseudo-label generation (CASP) for test-time adaptation for multimodal\nsentiment analysis. The two strategies deal with the distribution shifts for\nMSA by enforcing consistency and minimizing empirical risk, respectively.\nExtensive experiments show that CASP brings significant and consistent\nimprovements to the performance of the model across various distribution shift\nsettings and with different backbones, demonstrating its effectiveness and\nversatility.

    "abstract": "Learning in games refers to scenarios where multiple players interact in a\nshared environment, each aiming to minimize their regret. An equilibrium can be\ncomputed at a fast rate of $O(1/T)$ when all players follow the optimistic\nfollow-the-regularized-leader (OFTRL). However, this acceleration is limited to\nthe honest regime, in which all players adhere to a prescribed algorithm -- a\nsituation that may not be realistic in practice. To address this issue, we\npresent corrupted learning dynamics that adaptively find an equilibrium at a\nrate that depends on the extent to which each player deviates from the strategy\nsuggested by the prescribed algorithm. First, in two-player zero-sum corrupted\ngames, we provide learning dynamics for which the external regret of $x$-player\n(and similarly for $y$-player) is roughly bounded by $O(\\log (m_x m_y) +\n\\sqrt{\\hat{C}_y} + \\hat{C}_x)$, where $m_x$ and $m_y$ denote the number of\nactions of $x$- and $y$-players, respectively, and $\\hat{C}_x$ and $\\hat{C}_y$\nrepresent their cumulative deviations. We then extend our approach to\nmulti-player general-sum corrupted games, providing learning dynamics for which\nthe swap regret of player $i$ is bounded by $O(\\log T + \\sqrt{\\sum_{k}\n\\hat{C}_k \\log T} + \\hat{C}_i)$ ignoring dependence on the number of players\nand actions, where $\\hat{C}_i$ is the cumulative deviation of player $i$ from\nthe prescribed algorithm. Our learning dynamics are agnostic to the levels of\ncorruption. A key technical contribution is a new analysis that ensures the\nstability of a Markov chain under a new adaptive learning rate, thereby\nallowing us to achieve the desired bound in the corrupted regime while matching\nthe best existing bound in the honest regime. Notably, our framework can be\nextended to address not only corruption in strategies but also corruption in\nthe observed expected utilities, and we provide several matching lower bounds.",

However, these models often encounter challenges when applied to\nspecialized domains such as remote sensing due to the limited availability of\nimage-text pairs for training. To tackle this issue, we introduce DiffCLIP, a\nnovel framework that extends CLIP to effectively convey comprehensive\nlanguage-driven semantic information for accurate classification of\nhigh-dimensional multimodal remote sensing images. DiffCLIP is a few-shot\nlearning method that leverages unlabeled images for pretraining. It employs\nunsupervised mask diffusion learning to capture the distribution of diverse\nmodalities without requiring labels. The modality-shared image encoder maps\nmultimodal data into a unified subspace, extracting shared features with\nconsistent parameters across modalities. A well-trained image encoder further\nenhances learning by aligning visual representations with class-label text\ninformation from CLIP. By integrating these approaches, DiffCLIP significantly\nboosts CLIP performance using a minimal number of image-text pairs. We evaluate\nDiffCLIP on widely used high-dimensional multimodal datasets, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in addressing few-shot annotated classification tasks. DiffCLIP\nachieves an overall accuracy improvement of 10.65% across three remote sensing\ndatasets compared with CLIP, while utilizing only 2-shot image-text pairs.

However, this scenario is\nconstrained by the enthalpy-entropy compensation mechanism (Meyer-Neldel Rule,\nMNR), which is ubiquitously observed in biological process and chemical\nreactions. This sets a limitation of promoting ion transport by reducing\nactivation enthalpy. Notably, certain solid-state electrolytes characterized by\ndisordering or degenerate saddle states exhibit anomalous behaviours and\ndisobey MNR, suggesting the existence of an elusive source of entropy. Herein\nwe propose the concept of path entropy (Sp) governs kinetic process in dense\nand mobile ionic systems such as lithium diffusion in solid-state electrolytes.\nBy integrating Markov state method, well-tempered metadynamics, and machine\nlearning-based softness analysis, we elucidate the intricate relationship\nbetween fast ionic hopping and microscopic local environments in inorganic\nthiophosphates. The Sp accounts for a strong fluctuation of free energy\nlandscape perceived by Li cations and enables an assessment of their collective\ndiffusion behaviour as well. A unified framework is established for handling\ntime-evolved and group-collective ionic kinetics, which exploits pathway\nfrustration, transcending common \"static\" scenario in traditional\nentropy-driven approach based on compositional multiplicity.

Previous pruning approaches rely on access to\nthe original training dataset for both pruning and subsequent fine-tuning.\nHowever, access to the training data can be limited due to concerns such as\ndata privacy and commercial confidentiality. Furthermore, with covariate shift\n(disparities between test and training data distributions), pruning and\nfinetuning with training datasets can hinder the generalization of the pruned\nmodel to test data. To address these issues, pruning and finetuning the model\nwith test time samples becomes essential. However, test-time model pruning and\nfine-tuning incur additional computation costs and slow down the model's\nprediction speed, thus posing efficiency issues. Existing pruning methods are\nnot efficient enough for test time model pruning setting, since finetuning the\npruned model is needed to evaluate the importance of removable components. To\naddress this, we propose two variables to approximate the fine-tuned accuracy.\nWe then introduce an efficient pruning method that considers the approximated\nfinetuned accuracy and potential inference latency saving. To enhance\nfine-tuning efficiency, we propose an efficient knowledge distillation method\nthat only needs to generate pseudo labels for a small set of finetuning samples\none time, thereby reducing the expensive pseudo-label generation cost.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a comparable or\nsuperior tradeoff between test accuracy and inference latency, with a 32%\nrelative reduction in pruning and finetuning time compared to the best existing\nmethod.",

However, it is reported that these models are\nsuffering when they are dealing with hard datasets. Particularly, they perform\nmuch worse when dealing with unseen out-of-distribution premise and hypothesis.\nThey may not understand the semantic content but learn the spurious\ncorrelations. In this work, we propose the data augmentation and preprocessing\nmethods to solve the word overlap, numerical reasoning and length mismatch\nproblems. These methods are general methods that do not rely on the\ndistribution of the testing data and they help improve the robustness of the\nmodels.",

Currently,\nprosthetic hands controlled by signals such as brain-computer interfaces (BCI)\nand electromyography (EMG) face difficulties in precisely recognizing the\namputees' grasping gestures and executing anthropomorphic grasp processes.\nAlthough prosthetic hands equipped with vision systems enables the objects'\nfeature recognition, they lack perception of human grasping intention.\nTherefore, this paper explores the estimation of grasping gestures solely\nthrough visual data to accomplish anthropopathic grasping control and the\ndetermination of grasping intention within a multi-object environment. To\naddress this, we propose the Spatial Geometry-based Gesture Mapping (SG-GM)\nmethod, which constructs gesture functions based on the geometric features of\nthe human hand grasping processes. It's subsequently implemented on the\nprosthetic hand. Furthermore, we propose the Motion Trajectory Regression-based\nGrasping Intent Estimation (MTR-GIE) algorithm. This algorithm predicts\npre-grasping object utilizing regression prediction and prior spatial\nsegmentation estimation derived from the prosthetic hand's position and\ntrajectory.

Pulsar timing is a\nprimary approach for determining a pulsar's position, parallax, and distance.\nIn this paper, we explore the influence of the solar wind on astrometric\nmeasurements obtained through pulsar timing, focusing on its potential to\naffect the accuracy of these parameters. Using both theoretical calculation and\nmock-data simulations, we demonstrate a significant correlation between the\npulsar position, annual parallax and the solar-wind density parameters. This\ncorrelation strongly depends on the pulsar's ecliptic latitude. We show that\nfixing solar-wind density to an arbitrary value in the timing analysis can\nintroduce significant bias in the estimated pulsar position and parallax, and\nits significance is highly dependent on the ecliptic latitude of the pulsar and\nthe timing precision of the data. For pulsars with favourable ecliptic latitude\nand timing precision, the astrometric and solar-wind parameters can be measured\njointly with other timing parameters using single-frequency data. The parameter\ncorrelation can be mitigated by using multi-frequency data, which also\nsignificantly improves the measurement precision of these parameters; this is\nparticularly important for pulsars at a medium or high ecliptic latitude.\nAdditionally, for a selection of pulsars we reprocess their EPTA Data Release 2\ndata to include modelling of solar-wind effect in the timing analysis. This\ndelivers significant measurements of both parallax and solar-wind density, the\nlatter of which are consistent with those obtained at low-frequency band. In\nthe future, combining pulsar timing data at gigahertz and lower frequencies\nwill probably deliver the most robust and precise measurements of astrometry\nand solar wind properties in pulsar timing.",

While increasing evidence from the field of\nneuroscience supports that multiple levels of the visual system contribute to\nthe realization of CC, how the primary visual cortex (V1) plays role in CC is\nnot fully resolved. In specific, double-opponent (DO) neurons in V1 have been\nthought to contribute to realizing a degree of CC, but the computational\nmechanism is not clear. We build an electrophysiologically based V1 neural\nmodel to learn the color of the light source from a natural image dataset with\nthe ground truth illuminants as the labels. Based on the qualitative and\nquantitative analysis of the responsive properties of the learned model\nneurons, we found that both the spatial structures and color weights of the\nreceptive fields of the learned model neurons are quite similar to those of the\nsimple and DO neurons recorded in V1. Computationally, DO cells perform more\nrobustly than the simple cells in V1 for illuminant prediction. Therefore, this\nwork provides computational evidence supporting that V1 DO neurons serve to\nrealize color constancy by encoding the illuminant,which is contradictory to\nthe common hypothesis that V1 contributes to CC by discounting the illuminant\nusing its DO cells. This evidence is expected to not only help resolve the\nvisual mechanisms of CC, but also provide inspiration to develop more effective\ncomputer vision models.",

With utility of multi-view sensing and\nmulti-node joint transmission, cell-free is a promising technique to realize\nthis prospect. This paper aims to tackle the problem of access point (AP)\ndeployment in cell-free systems to balance the sensing accuracy and user rate.\nBy merging the D-optimality with Euclidean criterion, a novel integrated metric\nis proposed to be the objective function for both max-sum and max-min problems,\nwhich respectively guarantee the overall and lowest performance in multi-user\ncommunication and target tracking scenario. To solve the corresponding high\ndimensional non-convex multi-objective problem, the Soft actor-critic (SAC) is\nutilized to avoid risk of local optimal result.

    "abstract": "In differential privacy, $\\textit{continual observation}$ refers to problems\nin which we wish to continuously release a function of a dataset that is\nrevealed one element at a time. The challenge is to maintain a good\napproximation while keeping the combined output over all time steps\ndifferentially private. In the special case of $\\textit{continual counting}$ we\nseek to approximate a sum of binary input elements. This problem has received\nconsiderable attention lately, in part due to its relevance in implementations\nof differentially private stochastic gradient descent. $\\textit{Factorization\nmechanisms}$ are the leading approach to continual counting, but the best such\nmechanisms do not work well in $\\textit{streaming}$ settings since they require\nspace proportional to the size of the input. In this paper, we present a simple\napproach to approximating factorization mechanisms in low space via\n$\\textit{binning}$, where adjacent matrix entries with similar values are\nchanged to be identical in such a way that a matrix-vector product can be\nmaintained in sublinear space. Our approach has provable sublinear space\nguarantees for a class of lower triangular matrices whose entries are\nmonotonically decreasing away from the diagonal. We show empirically that even\nwith very low space usage we are able to closely match, and sometimes surpass,\nthe performance of asymptotically optimal factorization mechanisms. Recently,\nand independently of our work, Dvijotham et al. have also suggested an approach\nto implementing factorization mechanisms in a streaming setting. Their work\ndiffers from ours in several respects: It only addresses factorization into\n$\\textit{Toeplitz}$ matrices, only considers $\\textit{maximum}$ error, and uses\na different technique based on rational function approximation that seems less\nversatile than our binning approach.",

We\nfocus on two fundamental classes of diversities defined on $\\Re^k$: those that\nare Minkowski linear and those that are Minkowski sublinear. Many well-known\nfunctions in convex analysis belong to these classes, including diameter,\ncircumradius and mean width. We derive surprising characterizations of these\nclasses, and establish elegant connections between them. Motivated by classical\nresults in metric geometry, and connections with combinatorial optimization, we\nthen examine embeddability of finite diversities into $\\Re^k$.

In an effort to facilitate convenient\nanalytics and utilization of wireless big data, we introduce the concept of\nknowledge graphs into the field of mobile networks, giving rise to what we term\nas wireless data knowledge graphs (WDKGs).

Furthermore, to capture WDKG\ndynamics effectively, we segment the network into static snapshots based on the\ncoherence time and harness the power of recurrent neural networks to\nincorporate historical information.

    "abstract": "An effective approach for sampling from unnormalized densities is based on\nthe idea of gradually transporting samples from an easy prior to the\ncomplicated target distribution. Two popular methods are (1) Sequential Monte\nCarlo (SMC), where the transport is performed through successive annealed\ndensities via prescribed Markov chains and resampling steps, and (2) recently\ndeveloped diffusion-based sampling methods, where a learned dynamical transport\nis used. Despite the common goal, both approaches have different, often\ncomplementary, advantages and drawbacks. The resampling steps in SMC allow\nfocusing on promising regions of the space, often leading to robust\nperformance. While the algorithm enjoys asymptotic guarantees, the lack of\nflexible, learnable transitions can lead to slow convergence. On the other\nhand, diffusion-based samplers are learned and can potentially better adapt\nthemselves to the target at hand, yet often suffer from training instabilities.\nIn this work, we present a principled framework for combining SMC with\ndiffusion-based samplers by viewing both methods in continuous time and\nconsidering measures on path space. This culminates in the new Sequential\nControlled Langevin Diffusion (SCLD) sampling method, which is able to utilize\nthe benefits of both methods and reaches improved performance on multiple\nbenchmark problems, in many cases using only 10% of the training budget of\nprevious diffusion-based samplers.",

    "abstract": "Event-stream representation is the first step for many computer vision tasks\nusing event cameras. It converts the asynchronous event-streams into a\nformatted structure so that conventional machine learning models can be applied\neasily. However, most of the state-of-the-art event-stream representations are\nmanually designed and the quality of these representations cannot be guaranteed\ndue to the noisy nature of event-streams. In this paper, we introduce a\ndata-driven approach aiming at enhancing the quality of event-stream\nrepresentations. Our approach commences with the introduction of a new\nevent-stream representation based on spatial-temporal statistics, denoted as\nEvRep. Subsequently, we theoretically derive the intrinsic relationship between\nasynchronous event-streams and synchronous video frames. Building upon this\ntheoretical relationship, we train a representation generator, RepGen, in a\nself-supervised learning manner accepting EvRep as input. Finally, the\nevent-streams are converted to high-quality representations, termed as EvRepSL,\nby going through the learned RepGen (without the need of fine-tuning or\nretraining). Our methodology is rigorously validated through extensive\nevaluations on a variety of mainstream event-based classification and optical\nflow datasets (captured with various types of event cameras). The experimental\nresults highlight not only our approach's superior performance over existing\nevent-stream representations but also its versatility, being agnostic to\ndifferent event cameras and tasks.",

This paper\nproposes an improved no-reference light field image quality assessment\n(NR-LFIQA) metric for future immersive media broadcasting services. First, we\nextend the concept of depthwise separable convolution (DSC) to the spatial\ndomain of light field image (LFI) and introduce \"light field depthwise\nseparable convolution (LF-DSC)\", which can extract the LFI's spatial features\nefficiently.

Third, we define the spatial and angular feature estimations as\nauxiliary tasks in aiding the primary NR-LFIQA task by providing spatial and\nangular quality features as hints. To the best of our knowledge, this work is\nthe first exploration of deep auxiliary learning with spatial-angular hints on\nNR-LFIQA.

We\ntherefore conclude that the PAH$_{3.3}$ feature is linked to dust-enshrouded\nstar formation.

    "abstract": "The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is increasingly favored for\nscaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently, but it depends on\nheterogeneous compute and memory resources. These factors jointly affect system\nCost, Accuracy, and Performance (CAP), making trade-offs inevitable. Existing\nbenchmarks often fail to capture these trade-offs accurately, complicating\npractical deployment decisions. To address this, we introduce MoE-CAP, a\nbenchmark specifically designed for MoE systems. Our analysis reveals that\nachieving an optimal balance across CAP is difficult with current hardware; MoE\nsystems typically optimize two of the three dimensions at the expense of the\nthird-a dynamic we term the MoE-CAP trade-off. To visualize this, we propose\nthe CAP Radar Diagram. We further introduce sparsity-aware performance\nmetrics-Sparse Memory Bandwidth Utilization (S-MBU) and Sparse Model FLOPS\nUtilization (S-MFU)-to enable accurate performance benchmarking of MoE systems\nacross diverse hardware platforms and deployment scenarios.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) model creators commonly attach restrictive terms\nof use to both their models and their outputs. These terms typically prohibit\nactivities ranging from creating competing AI models to spreading\ndisinformation. Often taken at face value, these terms are positioned by\ncompanies as key enforceable tools for preventing misuse, particularly in\npolicy dialogs. But are these terms truly meaningful? There are myriad examples\nwhere these broad terms are regularly and repeatedly violated. Yet except for\nsome account suspensions on platforms, no model creator has actually tried to\nenforce these terms with monetary penalties or injunctive relief. This is\nlikely for good reason: we think that the legal enforceability of these\nlicenses is questionable.\n  This Article systematically assesses of the enforceability of AI model terms\nof use and offers three contributions. First, we pinpoint a key problem: the\nartifacts that they protect, namely model weights and model outputs, are\nlargely not copyrightable, making it unclear whether there is even anything to\nbe licensed. Second, we examine the problems this creates for other\nenforcement. Recent doctrinal trends in copyright preemption may further\nundermine state-law claims, while other legal frameworks like the DMCA and CFAA\noffer limited recourse. Anti-competitive provisions likely fare even worse than\nresponsible use provisions. Third, we provide recommendations to policymakers.\nThere are compelling reasons for many provisions to be unenforceable: they\nchill good faith research, constrain competition, and create quasi-copyright\nownership where none should exist. There are, of course, downsides: model\ncreators have fewer tools to prevent harmful misuse. But we think the better\napproach is for statutory provisions, not private fiat, to distinguish between\ngood and bad uses of AI, restricting the latter.",

    "abstract": "Surface visualizations are essential in analyzing three-dimensional\nspatiotemporal phenomena. Given its ability to provide enhanced spatial\nperception and scene maneuverability, virtual reality (VR) is an essential\nmedium for surface visualization and interaction tasks. Such tasks primarily\nrely on visual cues that require an unoccluded view of the surface region under\nconsideration. Haptic force feedback is a tangible interaction modality that\nalleviates the reliance on visual-only cues by allowing a direct physical\nsensation of the surface. In this paper, we evaluate the use of a force-based\nhaptic stylus compared to handheld VR controllers via a between-subjects user\nstudy involving fundamental interaction tasks performed on surface\nvisualizations. Keeping a consistent visual design across both modalities, our\nstudy incorporates tasks that require the localization of the highest, lowest,\nand random points on surfaces; and tasks that focus on brushing curves on\nsurfaces with varying complexity and occlusion levels. Our findings show that\nparticipants took longer to brush curves using the haptic modality but could\ndraw smoother curves compared to the handheld controllers. In contrast, haptics\nwas faster in point localization, but the accuracy depended on the visual cues\nand occlusions associated with the tasks. Finally, we discuss participant\nfeedback on using haptic force feedback as a tangible input modality and share\ntakeaways to help outline design strategies for using haptics-based tangible\ninputs for surface visualization and interaction tasks.",

    "abstract": "Shell models allow much greater scale separations than those presently\nachievable with direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations.\nConsequently, they are an invaluable tool for testing new concepts and ideas in\nthe theory of fully developed turbulence. They also successfully display energy\ncascades and intermittency in homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flows.\nMoreover, they are also of great interest to mathematical analysts because,\nwhile retaining some of the key features of the Euler and the Navier-Stokes\nequations, they are much more tractable. A comparison of the mathematical\nproperties of shell models and of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations\nis therefore essential in understanding the correspondence between the two\nsystems. Here we focus on the temporal evolution of the moments, or\n$L^{2m}$-norms, of the vorticity. Specifically, differential inequalities for\nthe moments of the vorticity in shell models are derived. The contribution of\nthe nonlinear term turns out to be much weaker than its equivalent for the\nthree-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. Consequently, pointwise-in-time\nestimates are shown to exist for the vorticity moments for shell models of any\norder. This result is also recovered via a high-low frequency slaving argument\nthat highlights the scaling relations between vorticity moments of different\norders. Finally, it is shown that the estimates for shell models formally\ncorrespond to those for the Navier-Stokes equations 'on a point'.",

    "abstract": "Real-life deployment of federated Learning (FL) often faces non-IID data,\nwhich leads to poor accuracy and slow convergence. Personalized FL (pFL)\ntackles these issues by tailoring local models to individual data sources and\nusing weighted aggregation methods for client-specific learning. However,\nexisting pFL methods often fail to provide each local model with global\nknowledge on demand while maintaining low computational overhead. Additionally,\nlocal models tend to over-personalize their data during the training process,\npotentially dropping previously acquired global information. We propose FLAYER,\na novel layer-wise learning method for pFL that optimizes local model\npersonalization performance. FLAYER considers the different roles and learning\nabilities of neural network layers of individual local models. It incorporates\nglobal information for each local model as needed to initialize the local model\ncost-effectively. It then dynamically adjusts learning rates for each layer\nduring local training, optimizing the personalized learning process for each\nlocal model while preserving global knowledge. Additionally, to enhance global\nrepresentation in pFL, FLAYER selectively uploads parameters for global\naggregation in a layer-wise manner. We evaluate FLAYER on four representative\ndatasets in computer vision and natural language processing domains. Compared\nto six state-of-the-art pFL methods, FLAYER improves the inference accuracy, on\naverage, by 5.40\\% (up to 14.29\\%).",

This paper proposes a time-varying STT\n(TDSTT) to improve the DSTT. The proposed TDSTT computes the sensitive\ndirections with time; thereby, it can perform uncertainty propagation analysis\nat any point instead of only a predefined epoch as the DSTT does. First, the\nderivatives of the sensitive directions are derived. Then, the differential\nequations for the high-order TDSTTs are derived and simplified using the\northogonality of sensitive directions. Next, complexity analysis is implemented\nto show the advantages of the proposed TDSTT over the STT. Finally, the TDSTT\nis applied to solve orbital uncertainty propagation problems in highly\nnonlinear three-body systems. Numerical results show that the proposed TDSTT\ncan yield nearly the same level of accuracy as the STT and DSTT. It is\napproximately 94% faster than the STT and has hundreds of improvements in speed\nover the DSTT when one wants to investigate the evolutions of orbital\nuncertainties.",
