    "abstract": "Designing Verilog modules requires meticulous attention to correctness,\nefficiency, and adherence to design specifications. However, manually writing\nVerilog code remains a complex and time-consuming task that demands both expert\nknowledge and iterative refinement. Leveraging recent advancements in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and their structured text generation capabilities, we\npropose VeriMind, an agentic LLM framework for Verilog code generation that\nsignificantly automates and optimizes the synthesis process. Unlike traditional\nLLM-based code generators, VeriMind employs a structured reasoning approach:\ngiven a user-provided prompt describing design requirements, the system first\nformulates a detailed train of thought before the final Verilog code is\ngenerated. This multi-step methodology enhances interpretability, accuracy, and\nadaptability in hardware design. In addition, we introduce a novel evaluation\nmetric-pass@ARC-which combines the conventional pass@k measure with Average\nRefinement Cycles (ARC) to capture both success rate and the efficiency of\niterative refinement. Experimental results on diverse hardware design tasks\ndemonstrated that our approach achieved up to $8.3\\%$ improvement on pass@k\nmetric and $8.1\\%$ on pass@ARC metric. These findings underscore the\ntransformative potential of agentic LLMs in automated hardware design, RTL\ndevelopment, and digital system synthesis.",

Our goal is to inherit two properties of standard algorithms\nfrom numerical analysis: (1) machine precision, i.e. we want to obtain\nsolutions that are accurate to near floating point error, and (2) numerical\ngenerality, i.e. we want them to apply broadly across problem instances. We\nfind that prior approaches using Transformers fail to meet these criteria, and\nidentify limitations present in existing architectures and training procedures.\nFirst, we show that softmax Transformers struggle to perform high-precision\nmultiplications, which prevents them from precisely learning numerical\nalgorithms. Second, we identify an alternate class of architectures, comprised\nentirely of polynomials, that can efficiently represent high-precision gradient\ndescent iterates. Finally, we investigate precision bottlenecks during training\nand address them via a high-precision training recipe that reduces stochastic\ngradient noise. Our recipe enables us to train two polynomial architectures,\ngated convolutions and linear attention, to perform gradient descent iterates\non least squares problems. For the first time, we demonstrate the ability to\ntrain to near machine precision. Applied iteratively, our models obtain\n100,000x lower MSE than standard Transformers trained end-to-end and they incur\na 10,000x smaller generalization gap on out-of-distribution problems.

These studies\ntypically use Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to prompt foundation models\nlike GPT and LLaMA to predict candidate genes. However, in real-world settings,\nfoundation models are not optimized for domain-specific tasks like clinical\ndiagnosis, yet inputs are unstructured clinical notes rather than standardized\nterms. How LLMs can be instructed to predict candidate genes or disease\ndiagnosis from unstructured clinical notes remains a major challenge. Methods:\nWe introduce RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG, two methods that combine\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze\nclinical notes. A five-question CoT protocol mimics expert reasoning, while RAG\nretrieves data from sources like HPO and OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in\nMan). We evaluated these approaches on rare disease datasets, including 5,980\nPhenopacket-derived notes, 255 literature-based narratives, and 220 in-house\nclinical notes from Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. Results: We found that\nrecent foundations models, including Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct and\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, outperformed earlier versions such as Llama 2\nand GPT-3.5. We also showed that RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG both\noutperform foundation models in candidate gene prioritization from clinical\nnotes; in particular, both methods with DeepSeek backbone resulted in a top-10\ngene accuracy of over 40% on Phenopacket-derived clinical notes. RAG-driven CoT\nworks better for high-quality notes, where early retrieval can anchor the\nsubsequent reasoning steps in domain-specific evidence, while CoT-driven RAG\nhas advantage when processing lengthy and noisy notes.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting (GS) has become one of the most important neural rendering\nalgorithms. GS represents 3D scenes using Gaussian components with trainable\ncolor and opacity. This representation achieves high-quality renderings with\nfast inference. Regrettably, it is challenging to integrate such a solution\nwith varying light conditions, including shadows and light reflections, manual\nadjustments, and a physical engine. Recently, a few approaches have appeared\nthat incorporate ray-tracing or mesh primitives into GS to address some of\nthese caveats. However, no such solution can simultaneously solve all the\nexisting limitations of the classical GS. Consequently, we introduce\nREdiSplats, which employs ray tracing and a mesh-based representation of flat\n3D Gaussians. In practice, we model the scene using flat Gaussian distributions\nparameterized by the mesh. We can leverage fast ray tracing and control\nGaussian modification by adjusting the mesh vertices. Moreover, REdiSplats\nallows modeling of light conditions, manual adjustments, and physical\nsimulation. Furthermore, we can render our models using 3D tools such as\nBlender or Nvdiffrast, which opens the possibility of integrating them with all\nexisting 3D graphics techniques dedicated to mesh representations.",

We prove that the worst-case\naverage reward of the evaluation policy with respect to all distributions in\nthe shifted uncertainty set provides, in a rigorous statistical sense, the\nleast conservative estimator for the average reward under the unknown true\ndistribution. This guarantee is available even if one has only access to one\nsingle trajectory of serially correlated state-action pairs.

This work explores CE detection as a case study for CPS-IoT\nfoundation models capable of long-term reasoning.

Our results show that the state-space model, Mamba, which belongs to\nthe second category, outperforms all methods in accuracy and generalization to\nlonger, unseen sensor traces.

Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMAs)\nhave emerged as a key enabler of the XL Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)\nparadigm, leveraging reconfigurable metamaterials to support large antenna\narrays. However, DMAs are inherently lossy due to propagation losses in the\nmicrostrip lines and radiative losses from the metamaterial elements, which\nreduce their gain and alter their beamforming characteristics compared to a\nlossless aperture.

Currently, inference-time scaling for\ntext-to-image diffusion models is largely limited to best-of-N sampling, where\nmultiple images are generated per prompt and a selection model chooses the best\noutput. Inspired by the recent success of reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 in\nthe language domain, we introduce an alternative to naive best-of-N sampling by\nequipping text-to-image Diffusion Transformers with in-context reflection\ncapabilities. We propose Reflect-DiT, a method that enables Diffusion\nTransformers to refine their generations using in-context examples of\npreviously generated images alongside textual feedback describing necessary\nimprovements. Instead of passively relying on random sampling and hoping for a\nbetter result in a future generation, Reflect-DiT explicitly tailors its\ngenerations to address specific aspects requiring enhancement. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that Reflect-DiT improves performance on the GenEval\nbenchmark (+0.19) using SANA-1.0-1.6B as a base model. Additionally, it\nachieves a new state-of-the-art score of 0.81 on GenEval while generating only\n20 samples per prompt, surpassing the previous best score of 0.80, which was\nobtained using a significantly larger model (SANA-1.5-4.8B) with 2048 samples\nunder the best-of-N approach.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and DeepSeek, have been applied\nto a wide range of domains in software engineering. However, their potential in\nthe context of High-Performance Computing (HPC) much remains to be explored.\nThis paper evaluates how well DeepSeek, a recent LLM, performs in generating a\nset of HPC benchmark codes: a conjugate gradient solver, the parallel heat\nequation, parallel matrix multiplication, DGEMM, and the STREAM triad\noperation. We analyze DeepSeek's code generation capabilities for traditional\nHPC languages like Cpp, Fortran, Julia and Python. The evaluation includes\ntesting for code correctness, performance, and scaling across different\nconfigurations and matrix sizes. We also provide a detailed comparison between\nDeepSeek and another widely used tool: GPT-4. Our results demonstrate that\nwhile DeepSeek generates functional code for HPC tasks, it lags behind GPT-4,\nin terms of scalability and execution efficiency of the generated code.",

    "abstract": "In large organizations, the number of financial transactions can grow\nrapidly, driving the need for fast and accurate multi-criteria invoice\nvalidation. Manual processing remains error-prone and time-consuming, while\ncurrent automated solutions are limited by their inability to support a variety\nof constraints, such as documents that are partially handwritten or\nphotographed with a mobile phone. In this paper, we propose to automate the\nvalidation of machine written invoices using document layout analysis and\nobject detection techniques based on recent deep learning (DL) models. We\nintroduce a novel dataset consisting of manually annotated real-world invoices\nand a multi-criteria validation process. We fine-tune and benchmark the most\nrelevant DL models on our dataset. Experimental results show the effectiveness\nof the proposed pipeline and selected DL models in terms of achieving fast and\naccurate validation of invoices.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the prior that a Deep Gaussian Process with polynomial kernels\ninduces. We observe that, even for relatively small depths, averaging effects\noccur within such a Deep Gaussian Process and that the prior can be analyzed\nand approximated effectively by means of the Berry-Esseen Theorem. One of the\nkey findings of this analysis is that, in the absence of careful\nhyper-parameter tuning, the prior of a Deep Gaussian Process either collapses\nrapidly towards zero as the depth increases or places negligible mass on low\nnorm functions. This aligns well with experimental findings and mirrors known\nresults for convolution based Deep Gaussian Processes.",

By explicitly deriving these improved parameterizations from a\ngeneralized Clarke transformation matrix, we unify various approaches into one\ncomprehensive mathematical framework. This unified representation provides\nclarity regarding their relationships and generalizes them beyond existing\nconstraints, including arbitrary joint numbers, joint distributions, and\nunderlying modeling assumptions. This unification consolidates prior insights\nand establishes Clarke coordinates as a foundational tool, enabling systematic\nknowledge transfer across different subfields within soft and continuum\nrobotics.",

    "abstract": "Effective indoor positioning is critical for public safety, enabling first\nresponders to locate at-risk individuals accurately during emergency scenarios.\nHowever, traditional Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) often perform\npoorly indoors due to poor coverage and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions.\nMoreover, relying on fixed cellular infrastructure, such as terrestrial\nnetworks (TNs), may not be feasible, as indoor signal coverage from a\nsufficient number of base stations or WiFi access points cannot be guaranteed\nfor accurate positioning. In this paper, we propose a rapidly deployable indoor\npositioning system (IPS) leveraging mobile anchors, including uncrewed aerial\nvehicles (UAVs) and Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellites, and discuss the role of\nGNSS and LEOs in localizing the mobile anchors. Additionally, we discuss the\nrole of sidelink-based positioning, which is introduced in 3rd Generation\nPartnership Project (3GPP) Release 18, in enabling public safety systems. By\nexamining outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) signal propagation, particularly\ndiffraction-based approaches, we highlight how propagation-aware positioning\nmethods can outperform conventional strategies that disregard propagation\nmechanism information. The study highlights how emerging 5G Advanced and\nNon-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) features offer new avenues to improve\npositioning in challenging indoor environments, ultimately paving the way for\ncost-effective and resilient IPS solutions tailored to public safety\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Arboviral diseases remain a major public health concern, particularly in\ntropical and subtropical regions where mosquito populations thrive. One\npromising strategy to curb transmission is the release of Aedes aegypti\nmosquitoes infected with Wolbachia, a bacterium that reduces their ability to\nspread viruses. However, past large-scale releases have not always been\nsuccessful, especially in complex urban settings, where restricted access to\ncertain areas often leads to infection establishment failures and wasted\nresources. To address this, we developed and analyzed a partial differential\nequation model that simulates how Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes are established\nin different urban environments. We also explored strategies to improve their\nsuccess under constraints on release size and the efficacy level of insecticide\nused for pre-release interventions. Our findings suggest that targeted releases\nare most effective in areas with limited mosquito movement without additional\ninsecticide use. In higher mosquito dispersal areas, reducing at least 35% of\nwild mosquitoes before release significantly improves establishment within nine\nmonths. Additionally, distributing releases over 2-5 weekly batches enhances\nsuccess more than a single large release, even without other interventions.\nThese findings offer practical insights for designing cost-effective and\nefficient Wolbachia-based mosquito control programs, reducing the burden of\nmosquito-borne diseases on vulnerable communities.",

    "abstract": "Audio and visual modalities are two predominant contact-free channels in\nvideos, which are often expected to carry a complementary relationship with\neach other. However, they may not always complement each other, resulting in\npoor audio-visual feature representations. In this paper, we introduce Gated\nRecursive Joint Cross Attention (GRJCA) using a gating mechanism that can\nadaptively choose the most relevant features to effectively capture the\nsynergic relationships across audio and visual modalities. Specifically, we\nimprove the performance of Recursive Joint Cross-Attention (RJCA) by\nintroducing a gating mechanism to control the flow of information between the\ninput features and the attended features of multiple iterations depending on\nthe strength of their complementary relationship. For instance, if the\nmodalities exhibit strong complementary relationships, the gating mechanism\nemphasizes cross-attended features, otherwise non-attended features. To further\nimprove the performance of the system, we also explored a hierarchical gating\napproach by introducing a gating mechanism at every iteration, followed by\nhigh-level gating across the gated outputs of each iteration. The proposed\napproach improves the performance of RJCA model by adding more flexibility to\ndeal with weak complementary relationships across audio and visual modalities.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on the challenging Affwild2 dataset to\ndemonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach. By effectively handling\nthe weak complementary relationships across the audio and visual modalities,\nthe proposed model achieves a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of\n0.561 (0.623) and 0.620 (0.660) for valence and arousal respectively on the\ntest set (validation set).",

Here, we demonstrate uncooled room-temperature MIR detectors based on\nlithium niobate surface acoustic wave phononic crystal (PnC) resonators\nintegrated with wavelength-and-polarization-selective metasurface absorber\narrays.

In RLHF, human preferences are typically modeled through a reward model,\nwhich serves as a proxy to guide policy learning during the reinforcement\nlearning stage, ultimately producing a policy aligned with human preferences.\nHowever, in this paper, we propose a fresh perspective on learning alignment\nbased on inverse reinforcement learning principles, where the optimal policy is\nstill derived from reward maximization. However, instead of relying on\npreference data, we directly learn the reward model from demonstration data.\nThis new formulation offers the flexibility to be applied even when only\ndemonstration data is available, a capability that current RLHF methods lack,\nand it also shows that demonstration data offers more utility than what\nconventional wisdom suggests.

The performance of\nstate-of-the-art capacity prediction methods is significantly hindered by the\nlimited availability of training data, primarily attributed to the expensive\nexperimentation and data sharing restrictions. To tackle this issue, this paper\npresents a recurrent conditional generative adversarial network (RCGAN) scheme\nto enrich the limited battery data by adding high-fidelity synthetic ones to\nimprove the capacity prediction. The proposed RCGAN scheme consists of a\ngenerator network to generate synthetic samples that closely resemble the true\ndata and a discriminator network to differentiate real and synthetic samples.\nLong shortterm memory (LSTM)-based generator and discriminator are leveraged to\nlearn the temporal and spatial distributions in the multivariate time-series\nbattery data. Moreover, the generator is conditioned on the capacity value to\naccount for changes in battery dynamics due to the degradation over usage\ncycles. The effectiveness of the RCGAN is evaluated across six batteries from\ntwo benchmark datasets (NASA and MIT). The raw data is then augmented with\nsynthetic samples from the RCGAN to train LSTM and gate recurrent unit (GRU)\nmodels for capacity prediction. Simulation results show that the models trained\nwith augmented datasets significantly outperform those trained with the\noriginal datasets in capacity prediction.",

However, the multiplicity fraction does not affect the\nsynthesized CMFs. To accurately fit the high-mass end of the CMF, it is\nessential to determine whether the CMF shows a slope transition from the\nlow-mass end to the high-mass one. If the CMF truly undergoes a slope\ntransition but observational biases obscure it, leading to a combined fit with\na shallower slope, this could artificially create a top-heavy CMF.",

This is made possible by introducing a novel\nmodel structure given in Cartesian coordinates. This Cartesian model structure\nmakes it possible to implement a nonparametric adaptive controller which\ncancels disturbances by approximating the effects of unknown disturbance forces\nand structurally unknown dynamics in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).\nIt is shown that the nonparametric adaptive controller leads to uniformly\nultimately bounded errors in the presence of unknown forces and unmodeled\ndynamics. Moreover, it is shown that the Cartesian formulation has certain\nadvantages in payload tracking control also in the non-adaptive case. The\nperformance of the nonparametric adaptive controller is validated in simulation\nand experiments with good results.",

A hallmark of this condition\nis the presence of inflammatory cells in the eye's anterior chamber, and\ndetecting these cells using AS-OCT images has attracted research interest.\nWhile recent efforts aim to replace manual cell detection with automated\ncomputer vision approaches, detecting extremely small (minuscule) objects in\nhigh-resolution images, such as AS-OCT, poses substantial challenges: (1) each\ncell appears as a minuscule particle, representing less than 0.005\\% of the\nimage, making the detection difficult, and (2) OCT imaging introduces\npixel-level noise that can be mistaken for cells, leading to false positive\ndetections. To overcome these challenges, we propose a minuscule cell detection\nframework through a progressive field-of-view focusing strategy. This strategy\nsystematically refines the detection scope from the whole image to a target\nregion where cells are likely to be present, and further to minuscule regions\npotentially containing individual cells. Our framework consists of two modules.\nFirst, a Field-of-Focus module uses a vision foundation model to segment the\ntarget region. Subsequently, a Fine-grained Object Detection module introduces\na specialized Minuscule Region Proposal followed by a Spatial Attention Network\nto distinguish individual cells from noise within the segmented region.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods for cell detection, providing enhanced efficacy for\nclinical applications.

    "abstract": "This paper reviews recent advancements in the application of optimal\ntransport (OT) to multivariate distribution-free nonparametric testing.\nInspired by classical rank-based methods, such as Wilcoxon's rank-sum and\nsigned-rank tests, we explore how OT-based ranks and signs generalize these\nconcepts to multivariate settings, while preserving key properties, including\ndistribution-freeness, robustness, and efficiency. Using the framework of\nasymptotic relative efficiency (ARE), we compare the power of the proposed\n(generalized Wilcoxon) tests against the Hotelling's $T^2$ test. The ARE lower\nbounds reveal the Hodges-Lehmann and Chernoff-Savage phenomena in the context\nof multivariate location testing, underscoring the high power and efficiency of\nthe proposed methods. We also demonstrate how OT-based ranks and signs can be\nseamlessly integrated with more modern techniques, such as kernel methods, to\ndevelop universally consistent, distribution-free tests. Additionally, we\npresent novel results on the construction of consistent and distribution-free\nkernel-based tests for multivariate symmetry, leveraging OT-based ranks and\nsigns.",

Different from the existing\nschemes, the proposed PLS scheme takes account of the uncertainty on the\neavesdropper's position within the 360$^\\circ$ service area offered by the\nSTAR-RIS. Specifically, the large system analytical method is utilized to\nderive the asymptotic expression of the average security rate achieved by the\nsecurity user, considering that the base station (BS) only has the statistical\ninformation of the eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI) and the\nuncertainty of its location. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed PLS\nscheme, we first formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the\nweighted sum rate of the security user and the public user. This optimization\nis conducted under the power allocation constraint, and some practical\nlimitations for STAR-RIS implementation, through jointly designing the active\nand passive beamforming variables. A novel iterative algorithm based on the\nminimum mean-square error (MMSE) and cross-entropy optimization (CEO) methods\nis proposed to effectively address the established non-convex optimization\nproblem with discrete variables. Simulation results indicate that the proposed\nrobust PLS scheme can effectively mitigate the information leakage across the\nentire coverage area of the STAR-RIS-assisted system, leading to superior\nperformance gain when compared to benchmark schemes encompassing traditional\nRIS-aided scheme.",

Within Louisiana's Medicaid\npopulation, tobacco use prevalence is particularly high compared to privately\ninsured groups, yet its full impact on long-term outcomes is not fully\nunderstood. This study aimed to investigate how tobacco use, in conjunction\nwith demographic and clinical risk factors, influences the incidence of COPD\nand COVID-19 among Medicaid enrollees over time. We analyzed Louisiana\nDepartment of Health data from January 2020 to February 2023. Chi-square tests\nwere conducted to provide descriptive statistics, and multivariate logistic\nregression models were applied across three discrete waves to assess both\ncross-sectional and longitudinal associations between risk factors and disease\noutcomes. Enrollees without baseline diagnoses of COPD or COVID-19 were\nfollowed to determine new-onset cases in subsequent waves. Adjusted odds ratios\n(AOR) were calculated after controlling for socio-demographic variables,\ncomorbidities, and healthcare utilization patterns. Tobacco use emerged as a\nsignificant independent predictor of both COPD (Adjusted Odd Ratio= 1.12) and\nCOVID-19 (Adjusted Odd Ratio = 1.66). Additional risk factors -- such as older\nage, gender, region, and pre-existing health conditions -- also showed\nsignificant associations with higher incidence rates of COPD and COVID-19. By\nlinking tobacco use, demographic disparities, and comorbidities to an increased\nrisk of COPD and COVID-19, this study underscores the urgent need for targeted\ntobacco cessation efforts and prevention strategies within this underserved\npopulation.",

However, existing methods adopt the centralized training, ignoring the\npotential privacy concerns as the data is distributed across multiple devices\nor entities in reality. In this paper, we propose L2RW+, a benchmark that\nbrings VI-ReID closer to real-world applications. The core rationale behind\nL2RW+ is that incorporating decentralized training into VI-ReID can address\nprivacy concerns in scenarios with limited data-sharing constrains.\nSpecifically, we design protocols and corresponding algorithms for different\nprivacy sensitivity levels. In our new benchmark, we simulate the training\nunder real-world data conditions that: 1) data from each camera is completely\nisolated, or 2) different data entities (e.g., data controllers of a certain\nregion) can selectively share the data. In this way, we simulate scenarios with\nstrict privacy restrictions, which is closer to real-world conditions.\nComprehensive experiments show the feasibility and potential of decentralized\nVI-ReID training at both image and video levels. In particular, with increasing\ndata scales, the performance gap between decentralized and centralized training\ndecreases, especially in video-level VI-ReID. In unseen domains, decentralized\ntraining even achieves performance comparable to SOTA centralized methods.

The\nsaturation number for posets is known to exhibit a dichotomy: it is either\nbounded or it has at least $\\sqrt n$ rate of growth.

We show that (under some mild assumptions)\nthis operation preserves bounded and unbounded saturation number. This is the\nfirst such `new from old' poset construction to be found. As an application, we\nshow that for any poset $\\mathcal P$ one may add at most 3 elements to\n$\\mathcal P$ to obtain a poset whose saturation number growth is at most\nlinear: this may be viewed as a step towards the other major open problem in\nthe area, namely the conjecture that every finite poset has this growth at most\nlinear.\n  We also consider the poset equivalent of weak saturation for graphs: for each\nfinite poset $\\mathcal P$, we determine exactly the minimum size of a\npercolating family for $\\mathcal P$.",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) looks at learning how to optimally solve\ntasks using a fixed dataset of interactions from the environment. Many\noff-policy algorithms developed for online learning struggle in the offline\nsetting as they tend to over-estimate the behaviour of out of distributions\nactions. Existing offline RL algorithms adapt off-policy algorithms, employing\ntechniques such as constraining the policy or modifying the value function to\nachieve good performance on individual datasets but struggle to adapt to\ndifferent tasks or datasets of different qualities without tuning\nhyper-parameters. We introduce a policy switching technique that dynamically\ncombines the behaviour of a pure off-policy RL agent, for improving behaviour,\nand a behavioural cloning (BC) agent, for staying close to the data. We achieve\nthis by using a combination of epistemic uncertainty, quantified by our RL\nmodel, and a metric for aleatoric uncertainty extracted from the dataset. We\nshow empirically that our policy switching technique can outperform not only\nthe individual algorithms used in the switching process but also compete with\nstate-of-the-art methods on numerous benchmarks. Our use of epistemic\nuncertainty for policy switching also allows us to naturally extend our method\nto the domain of offline to online fine-tuning allowing our model to adapt\nquickly and safely from online data, either matching or exceeding the\nperformance of current methods that typically require additional modification\nor hyper-parameter fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of agent functions subject to\naffine coupling constraints. Dual methods are attractive for such problems\nbecause they allow the agent-level subproblems to be solved in parallel.\nHowever, achieving primal feasibility with dual methods is a challenge; it can\ntake many iterations to find sufficiently precise prices that recover a primal\nfeasible solution, and even with exact prices primal feasibility is not\nguaranteed, unless special conditions like strict convexity hold. This behavior\ncan limit the usefulness of dual decomposition methods. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a novel primal recovery method, multiple-response agents\n(MRA), that is able to rapidly reduce primal infeasibility, tolerating some\ndegree of suboptimality, and can be used with any dual algorithm. Rather than\nreturning a single primal response to each price query, MRA requires agents to\ngenerate multiple primal responses, each of which has bounded suboptimality.\nThese multiple responses can be computed in parallel, so there is no increase\nin the wall clock time of the underlying dual algorithm. Then a convex\ncombination of the multiple responses is formed by minimizing the sum of the\nprimal and complementary slackness residuals. We test MRA using both a price\nlocalization method and a dual subgradient method and show that it typically\nconverges to a feasible, approximate solution in a few tens of iterations.\nMoreover, hyperparameters can be tuned to control the trade-off among speed,\ncomputational budget, and degree of suboptimality of the feasible solutions\nreturned.",

However, heterogeneous data\nacross diverse regions, driven by factors such as varying consumer behavior,\nposes challenges to the effectiveness of federated learning. To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose Privacy-Adaptive Clustered Federated Learning (PA-CFL)\ntailored for demand forecasting on heterogeneous retail data. By leveraging\ndifferential privacy and feature importance distribution, PA-CFL groups\nretailers into distinct ``bubbles'', each forming its own federated learning\nsystem to effectively isolate data heterogeneity. Within each bubble,\nTransformer models are designed to predict local sales for each client. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that PA-CFL significantly surpasses FedAvg and\noutperforms local learning in demand forecasting performance across all\nparticipating clients. Compared to local learning, PA-CFL achieves a 5.4%\nimprovement in R^2, a 69% reduction in RMSE, and a 45% decrease in MAE. Our\napproach enables effective FL through adaptive adjustments to diverse noise\nlevels and the range of clients participating in each bubble. By grouping\nparticipants and proactively filtering out high-risk clients, PA-CFL mitigates\npotential threats to the FL system. The findings demonstrate PA-CFL's ability\nto enhance federated learning in time series prediction tasks with\nheterogeneous data, achieving a balance between forecasting accuracy and\nprivacy preservation in retail applications.

The necessity for fine-tuning significantly limits\nCLIP's adaptability to novel datasets and domains. This requirement mandates\nsubstantial time and computational resources for each new dataset. To overcome\nthis limitation, we introduce simple yet effective training-free approaches,\nSingle-stage LMM Augmented CLIP (SLAC) and Two-stage LMM Augmented CLIP (TLAC),\nthat leverages powerful Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), such as Gemini, for\nimage classification.

However, the\nhigh cost of real-world data collection hinders further data scaling, thereby\nrestricting the generalizability of VLAs. In this paper, we introduce ReBot, a\nnovel real-to-sim-to-real approach for scaling real robot datasets and adapting\nVLA models to target domains, which is the last-mile deployment challenge in\nrobot manipulation. Specifically, ReBot replays real-world robot trajectories\nin simulation to diversify manipulated objects (real-to-sim), and integrates\nthe simulated movements with inpainted real-world background to synthesize\nphysically realistic and temporally consistent robot videos (sim-to-real). Our\napproach has several advantages: 1) it enjoys the benefit of real data to\nminimize the sim-to-real gap; 2) it leverages the scalability of simulation;\nand 3) it can generalize a pretrained VLA to a target domain with fully\nautomated data pipelines. Extensive experiments in both simulation and\nreal-world environments show that ReBot significantly enhances the performance\nand robustness of VLAs. For example, in SimplerEnv with the WidowX robot, ReBot\nimproved the in-domain performance of Octo by 7.2% and OpenVLA by 21.8%, and\nout-of-domain generalization by 19.9% and 9.4%, respectively. For real-world\nevaluation with a Franka robot, ReBot increased the success rates of Octo by\n17% and OpenVLA by 20%. More information can be found at:\nhttps://yuffish.github.io/rebot/",

    "abstract": "Feature Distillation (FD) strategies are proven to be effective in mitigating\nCatastrophic Forgetting (CF) seen in Class Incremental Learning (CIL). However,\ncurrent FD approaches enforce strict alignment of feature magnitudes and\ndirections across incremental steps, limiting the model's ability to adapt to\nnew knowledge. In this paper we propose Structurally Stable Incremental\nLearning(S22IL), a FD method for CIL that mitigates CF by focusing on\npreserving the overall spatial patterns of features which promote flexible\n(plasticity) yet stable representations that preserve old knowledge\n(stability). We also demonstrate that our proposed method S2IL achieves strong\nincremental accuracy and outperforms other FD methods on SOTA benchmark\ndatasets CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K. Notably, S2IL outperforms\nother methods by a significant margin in scenarios that have a large number of\nincremental tasks.",

The goal of this study is to aid software\norganizations in reducing the risk of software supply chain attacks by\nsystematically synthesizing how framework tasks mitigate the attack techniques\nused in the SolarWinds, Log4j, and XZ Utils attacks. We qualitatively analyzed\n106 Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports of the 3 attacks to gather the\nattack techniques. We then systematically constructed a mapping between attack\ntechniques and the 73 tasks enumerated in 10 software supply chain frameworks.\nAfterward, we established and ranked priority tasks that mitigate attack\ntechniques. The three mitigation tasks with the highest scores are role-based\naccess control, system monitoring, and boundary protection. Additionally, three\nmitigation tasks were missing from all ten frameworks, including sustainable\nopen-source software and environmental scanning tools.

This paper presents a\ntutorial on the generator comparison approach of Stein's method for analyzing\ndiffusion approximations in Markovian models where state transitions are\ngoverned by general clocks, which extends the well-established theory for\ncontinuous-time Markov chains and enables non-asymptotic error bounds for these\napproximations. Building on recent work that applies this method to\nsingle-clock systems, we develop a framework for handling models with multiple\ngeneral clocks. Our approach is illustrated through canonical queueing systems,\nincluding the G/G/1 queue, the join-the-shortest-queue system, and the tandem\nqueue. We highlight the role of the Palm inversion formula and the compensated\nqueue-length process in extracting the diffusion generator. Most of our error\nterms depend only on the first three moments of the general clock distribution.\nThe rest require deeper, model-specific, insight to bound, but could in theory\nalso depend on only the first three moments.",

This study specifically focuses on\nleveraging the textual metadata (e.g., titles and brands) associated with\nitems. While existing methods have achieved notable success by combining text\nand ID representations, they often struggle to strike a balance between textual\ninformation embedded in text representations and collaborative information from\nsequential patterns of user behavior. In light of this, we propose CCFRec, a\nnovel Code-based textual and Collaborative semantic Fusion method for\nsequential Recommendation. The key idea behind our approach is to bridge the\ngap between textual and collaborative information using semantic codes.\nSpecifically, we generate fine-grained semantic codes from multi-view text\nembeddings through vector quantization techniques. Subsequently, we develop a\ncode-guided semantic-fusion module based on the cross-attention mechanism to\nflexibly extract and integrate relevant information from text representations.\nIn order to further enhance the fusion of textual and collaborative semantics,\nwe introduce an optimization strategy that employs code masking with two\nspecific objectives: masked code modeling and masked sequence alignment. The\nmerit of these objectives lies in leveraging mask prediction tasks and\naugmented item representations to capture code correlations within individual\nitems and enhance the sequence modeling of the recommendation backbone.\nExtensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of CCFRec, showing significant improvements over various sequential\nrecommendation models.

Recent advances use an end-to-end neural\nnetwork to learn the project-and-capture process. However, these neural\nnetwork-based methods often implicitly encapsulate scene parameters, such as\nsurface material, gamma, and white balance in the network parameters, and are\nless interpretable and hard for novel scene simulation.

    "abstract": "We propose LAPIG, a language guided projector image generation method with\nsurface adaptation and stylization. LAPIG consists of a projector-camera system\nand a target textured projection surface. LAPIG takes the user text prompt as\ninput and aims to transform the surface style using the projector. LAPIG's key\nchallenge is that due to the projector's physical brightness limitation and the\nsurface texture, the viewer's perceived projection may suffer from color\nsaturation and artifacts in both dark and bright regions, such that even with\nthe state-of-the-art projector compensation techniques, the viewer may see\nclear surface texture-related artifacts. Therefore, how to generate a projector\nimage that follows the user's instruction while also displaying minimum surface\nartifacts is an open problem. To address this issue, we propose projection\nsurface adaptation (PSA) that can generate compensable surface stylization. We\nfirst train two networks to simulate the projector compensation and\nproject-and-capture processes, this allows us to find a satisfactory projector\nimage without real project-and-capture and utilize gradient descent for fast\nconvergence. Then, we design content and saturation losses to guide the\nprojector image generation, such that the generated image shows no clearly\nperceivable artifacts when projected. Finally, the generated image is projected\nfor visually pleasing surface style morphing effects. The source code and video\nare available on the project page: https://Yu-chen-Deng.github.io/LAPIG/.",

    "abstract": "Generative models have rapidly evolved to generate realistic outputs.\nHowever, their synthetic outputs increasingly challenge the clear distinction\nbetween natural and AI-generated content, necessitating robust watermarking\ntechniques. Watermarks are typically expected to preserve the integrity of the\ntarget image, withstand removal attempts, and prevent unauthorized replication\nonto unrelated images. To address this need, recent methods embed persistent\nwatermarks into images produced by diffusion models using the initial noise.\nYet, to do so, they either distort the distribution of generated images or rely\non searching through a long dictionary of used keys for detection.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel watermarking method that embeds semantic\ninformation about the generated image directly into the watermark, enabling a\ndistortion-free watermark that can be verified without requiring a database of\nkey patterns. Instead, the key pattern can be inferred from the semantic\nembedding of the image using locality-sensitive hashing. Furthermore,\nconditioning the watermark detection on the original image content improves\nrobustness against forgery attacks. To demonstrate that, we consider two\nlargely overlooked attack strategies: (i) an attacker extracting the initial\nnoise and generating a novel image with the same pattern; (ii) an attacker\ninserting an unrelated (potentially harmful) object into a watermarked image,\npossibly while preserving the watermark. We empirically validate our method's\nincreased robustness to these attacks. Taken together, our results suggest that\ncontent-aware watermarks can mitigate risks arising from image-generative\nmodels.",

The strongest\nnonlinearity in hot atomic vapors originates from electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT), which, while effective, often lacks tunability and suffers\nfrom significant losses due to atomic absorption. We propose and demonstrate an\nN-level EIT scheme, created by an optical frequency comb that excites a warm\nrubidium vapor. The massive number of comb lines simultaneously drive numerous\ntransitions that interfere constructively to induce a giant and highly tunable\ncross-Kerr optical nonlinearity. The obtained third-order nonlinearity values\nrange from $1.2 \\times 10^{-7}$ to $7.7 \\times 10^{-7}$ $m^2 V^{-2}$. Above and\nbeyond that, the collective N-level interference can be optimized by phase\nshaping the comb lines using a spectral phase mask. Each nonlinearity value can\nthen be tuned over a wide range, from 40\\% to 250\\% of the initial strength. We\nutilize the nonlinearity to demonstrate squeezing by self polarization rotation\nof CW signals that co-propagate with the pump and are tuned to one of the EIT\ntransparent regions. Homodyne measurements reveal a quadrature squeezing level\nof 3.5 dB at a detuning of 640 MHz. When tuned closer to an atomic resonance,\nthe nonlinearity is significantly enhanced while maintaining low losses,\nresulting in the generation of non-Gaussian cubic phase states. These states\nexhibit negative regions in their Wigner functions, a hallmark of quantum\nbehavior. Consequently, N-level EIT enables the direct generation of photonic\nquantum states without requiring postselection.",

    "abstract": "Deep generative models (DGMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success\nin capturing complex probability distributions over graphs. Although their\nexcellent performance is attributed to powerful and scalable deep neural\nnetworks, it is, at the same time, exactly the presence of these highly\nnon-linear transformations that makes DGMs intractable. Indeed, despite\nrepresenting probability distributions, intractable DGMs deny probabilistic\nfoundations by their inability to answer even the most basic inference queries\nwithout approximations or design choices specific to a very narrow range of\nqueries. To address this limitation, we propose probabilistic graph circuits\n(PGCs), a framework of tractable DGMs that provide exact and efficient\nprobabilistic inference over (arbitrary parts of) graphs. Nonetheless,\nachieving both exactness and efficiency is challenging in the\npermutation-invariant setting of graphs. We design PGCs that are inherently\ninvariant and satisfy these two requirements, yet at the cost of low expressive\npower. Therefore, we investigate two alternative strategies to achieve the\ninvariance: the first sacrifices the efficiency, and the second sacrifices the\nexactness. We demonstrate that ignoring the permutation invariance can have\nsevere consequences in anomaly detection, and that the latter approach is\ncompetitive with, and sometimes better than, existing intractable DGMs in the\ncontext of molecular graph generation.",

And\nresearches about student's utilisation and perceptions of GAI remains\nrelatively scarce. To gain insight into the issue, this paper proposed a\nhybrid-survey method to examine the impact of GAI on students across four\ndifferent grades in six key areas (LIPSAL): learning interest, independent\nlearning, problem solving, self-confidence, appropriate use, and learning\nenjoyment. Firstly, through questionnaire, we found that among LIPSAL, GAI has\nthe greatest impact on the concept of appropriate use, the lowest level of\nlearning interest and self-confidence. Secondly, a comparison of four grades\nrevealed that the high and low factors of LIPSAL exhibited grade-related\nvariation, and college students exhibited a higher level than high school\nstudents across LIPSAL. Thirdly, through interview, the students demonstrated a\ncomprehensive understanding of the application of GAI.

By introducing the basic concepts of categories, functors, and\nnatural transformations, we establish that the model constructions derived from\neach theorem can be viewed as functors from the category of logical theories to\nthe category of their models. In particular, one functor is defined using the\nHenkin construction from the completeness theorem, while another is defined\nbased on the finite satisfiability condition of the compactness theorem. We\nthen prove the existence of a natural transformation between these two\nfunctors, which demonstrates that the models produced by each method are\nisomorphic in a canonical way.

A dataset\nof 1266 reviews, alongside corresponding star ratings, was compiled and\npreprocessed for analysis. Initial sentiment analysis was conducted using the\nSentiment Intensity Analyzer (VADER), a rule-based tool that assigns sentiment\nscores across positive, negative, and neutral categories. However, a noticeable\nbias toward neutrality often led to an inaccurate representation of sentiment\nintensity. To mitigate this issue, based on a fuzzy perspective, two refinement\ntechniques were introduced, applying square-root and fourth-root\ntransformations to amplify positive and negative sentiment scores while\nmaintaining neutrality. This led to three distinct methodologies: Approach 1,\nutilizing unaltered VADER scores; Approach 2, modifying sentiment values using\nthe square root; and Approach 3, applying the fourth root for further\nrefinement. A Fuzzy Inference System incorporating comprehensive fuzzy rules\nwas then developed to process these refined scores and generate a single,\ncontinuous sentiment value for each review based on each approach. Comparative\nanalysis, including human supervision and alignment with customer star ratings,\nrevealed that the refined approaches significantly improved sentiment analysis\nby reducing neutrality bias and better capturing sentiment intensity.

In\nthis work, we investigate a special (``degenerate'') case of fluid\npolyamorphism, in which all three characteristic parameters of the\ninterconversion equilibrium constant, i.e. the changes of energy, entropy, and\nvolume, are zero. This feature of interconversion is typical for the Ising spin\nmodel of ferromagnets but is also observed in a polyamorphic chiral fluid\nmixture of interconverting enantiomers. To investigate the consequences of\ninterconversion's degeneration for fluid polyamorphism, we have performed a\nmeanfield analysis and 3D Monte Carlo simulations of a compressible binary\nlattice with interconverting species (referred to as the ``blinking-checkers\nmodel''), which generally demonstrates the existence of both liquid-gas and\nliquid-liquid transitions. By tuning the interaction parameters, we have\ndemonstrated that, in the degenerate interconverting case, a coupling between\nthe fraction of interconversion (a vector-like nonconserved order parameter)\nand the total density (a scalar conserved order parameter) may produce a\nsymmetrical tricritical point. At this point, the line of second-order\ntransitions between two fluids, ``disordered'' (with 50:50 interconversion) and\n``ordered'' (with temperature and pressure dependent interconversion fraction),\nis terminated by first-order transitions between the fluid states. This point\nexhibits the typical features of symmetrical tricritical points as observed in\na superfluid mixture of helium isotopes and in some magnetic materials.

    "abstract": "This paper presents FedAlign, a Federated Learning (FL) framework\nparticularly designed for System Identification (SYSID) tasks by aligning state\nrepresentations. Local workers can learn State-Space Models (SSMs) with\nequivalent representations but different dynamics. We demonstrate that directly\naggregating these local SSMs via FedAvg results in a global model with altered\nsystem dynamics. FedAlign overcomes this problem by employing similarity\ntransformation matrices to align state representations of local SSMs, thereby\nestablishing a common parameter basin that retains the dynamics of local SSMs.\nFedAlign computes similarity transformation matrices via two distinct\napproaches: FedAlign-A and FedAlign-O. In FedAlign-A, we represent the global\nSSM in controllable canonical form (CCF). We apply control theory to\nanalytically derive similarity transformation matrices that convert each local\nSSM into this form. Yet, establishing global SSM in CCF brings additional\nalignment challenges in multi input - multi output SYSID as CCF representation\nis not unique, unlike in single input - single output SYSID. In FedAlign-O, we\naddress these alignment challenges by reformulating the local parameter basin\nalignment problem as an optimization task. We determine the parameter basin of\na local worker as the common parameter basin and solve least square problems to\nobtain similarity transformation matrices needed to align the remaining local\nSSMs. Through the experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets,\nwe show that FedAlign outperforms FedAvg, converges faster, and provides\nimproved stability of the global SSM thanks to the efficient alignment of local\nparameter basins.",

The sensitive radio observations\nprovide a new window to study the complex physics occurring in this system.\nApart from significant detections of the known diffuse radio emission in the\ncluster, we detect the central diffuse emission to a much larger extent of\n$\\sim$ 3.2 Mpc, reaching the R$_{500}$ of the cluster. The radial surface\nbrightness profile shows a distinct flattening beyond $\\sim$0.5R$_{500}$,\ndividing the emission into inner and outer components.

The\nradial profile of the spectral index also distinguishes the steep spectrum\nmegahalo emission. Our observational results align with recent numerical\nsimulations, showing megahalo emission oriented along the merger axis and the\nre-acceleration of electrons driven by late-stage merger-induced turbulence.\nThis is the first detection of a radio megahalo at a frequency higher than the\nLOFAR 144 MHz, opening the possibilities for more discoveries and spectral\nstudies to understand their origin.",

This approach is a general relativistic extension to the\nclassical treatment of Cao and Spruit (1994). The initial plasma $\\beta$ that\npermits magnetically driven outflow solutions is constrained, with the slow\nmagnetosonic point above the footpoint setting an upper limit\n($\\beta_\\mathrm{b}\\lesssim 2$) and the Alfv\\'en point inside the light cylinder\nsetting a lower limit ($\\beta_\\mathrm{b}\\gtrsim 0.02$).

It utilizes the underutilized valley\nemphasis method for optimal split point determination and incorporates sparsity\nrandomization in soft sparse random projection for enhanced anomaly detection\nrobustness. Across 24 benchmark datasets, experiments demonstrate RiForest's\nconsistent outperformance of existing algorithms in anomaly detection,\nemphasizing stability and robustness to noise variables.",

To address this gap, we introduce\n\\textbf{MT-RewardTree}, a comprehensive framework for constructing, evaluating,\nand deploying process reward models in MT. Unlike traditional vanilla\npreference pair construction, we propose a novel method for automatically\ngenerating token-level preference pairs using approximate Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS), which mitigates the prohibitive cost of human annotation for\nfine-grained steps. Then, we establish the first MT-specific reward model\nbenchmark and provide a systematic comparison of different reward modeling\narchitectures, revealing that token-level supervision effectively captures\nfine-grained preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nMT-PRM-Qwen-2.5-3B achieves state-of-the-art performance in both token-level\nand sequence-level evaluation given the same input prefix. Furthermore, we\nshowcase practical applications where PRMs enable test-time alignment for LLMs\nwithout additional alignment training and significantly improve performance in\nhypothesis ensembling.

To address these challenges, we propose\nInstruction-Conditioned Coordinator (ICCO), a Multi-Agent Reinforcement\nLearning (MARL) framework designed to enhance coordination in language-guided\nmulti-robot systems. ICCO consists of a Coordinator agent and multiple Local\nAgents, where the Coordinator generates Task-Aligned and Consistent\nInstructions (TACI) by integrating language instructions with environmental\nstates, ensuring task alignment and behavioral consistency. The Coordinator and\nLocal Agents are jointly trained to optimize a reward function that balances\ntask efficiency and instruction following. A Consistency Enhancement Term is\nadded to the learning objective to maximize mutual information between\ninstructions and robot behaviors, further improving coordination.

In contrast to other\nmethods, we do not use EMF to move \"uphill\" or \"downhill\" in energy to find\nstationary points, but to obtain energy curves. By numerical integration of the\nBoltzmann factor along these curves, the partition functions of the followed\neigenmodes can be calculated without making assumptions of the form of the\nenergy curves. The EMF method is computationally more elaborate than\ntraditional approaches as it requires iterative updates of the respective\neigenpair spectrum. In order to mitigate this increase in computational cost,\nthe EMF method can be combined with other approaches like the harmonic\napproximation for all eigenmodes but the softest which typically require the\nmost accurate mod elling. In this work we first introduce the general\ntheoretical background and algorithm of the EMF method before providing test\ncalculations and relevant use-cases in the framework of atomistic spin\nsimulations with a focus on magnetic skyrmions collapse.",

Our study is based on\na 1D representation of a hydrodynamic simulation of a 0.6 $M_{\\odot}$ CO + 0.4\n$M_{\\odot}$ He WD merger. We calculate both photospheric and nebular-phase\nspectra including treatment for non-thermal electrons, as is required for\naccurate modelling of He I and [Ca II]. Consistent with Ca-rich transients, our\nsimulation predicts a nebular spectrum dominated by emission from [Ca II] 7291,\n7324 angstrom and the Ca II near-infrared (NIR) triplet. The photospheric-phase\nsynthetic spectrum also exhibits a strong Ca II NIR triplet, prominent optical\nabsorption due to He I 5876 angstrom and He I 10830 angstrom in the NIR, as is\ncommonly observed for Ca-rich transients. Overall, our results therefore\nsuggest that CO+He WD mergers are a promising channel for Ca-rich transients.\nHowever, the current simulation overpredicts some He I features, in particular\nboth He I 6678 and 7065 angstrom and shows a significant contribution from Ti\nII, which results in a spectral energy distribution that is substantially\nredder than most Ca-rich transients at peak. Additionally the Ca II nebular\nemission features are too broad.

    "abstract": "Entity Segmentation (ES) aims at identifying and segmenting distinct entities\nwithin an image without the need for predefined class labels. This\ncharacteristic makes ES well-suited to open-world applications with adaptation\nto diverse and dynamically changing environments, where new and previously\nunseen entities may appear frequently. Existing ES methods either require large\nannotated datasets or high training costs, limiting their scalability and\nadaptability. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), especially in its\nAutomatic Mask Generation (AMG) mode, has shown potential for holistic image\nsegmentation. However, it struggles with over-segmentation and\nunder-segmentation, making it less effective for ES. In this paper, we\nintroduce E-SAM, a novel training-free framework that exhibits exceptional ES\ncapability. Specifically, we first propose Multi-level Mask Generation (MMG)\nthat hierarchically processes SAM's AMG outputs to generate reliable\nobject-level masks while preserving fine details at other levels. Entity-level\nMask Refinement (EMR) then refines these object-level masks into accurate\nentity-level masks. That is, it separates overlapping masks to address the\nredundancy issues inherent in SAM's outputs and merges similar masks by\nevaluating entity-level consistency. Lastly, Under-Segmentation Refinement\n(USR) addresses under-segmentation by generating additional high-confidence\nmasks fused with EMR outputs to produce the final ES map. These three modules\nare seamlessly optimized to achieve the best ES without additional training\noverhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that E-SAM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to prior ES methods, demonstrating a\nsignificant improvement by +30.1 on benchmark metrics.",

While\ntraditional sparse convolution techniques efficiently capture local structures,\nthey struggle with modeling long-range relationships. However, capturing\nlong-range dependencies is fundamental for 3D object detection. In contrast,\ntransformers are designed to capture these long-range dependencies through\nattention mechanisms. But, they come with high computational costs, due to\ntheir quadratic query-key-value interactions. Furthermore, directly applying\nattention to non-empty voxels is inefficient due to the sparse nature of 3D\nscenes. Our SFMNet is built on a novel Sparse Focal Modulation (SFM) module,\nwhich integrates short- and long-range contexts with linear complexity by\nleveraging a new hierarchical sparse convolution design.

However, the key limitation it\nmeets is the reliance on a hand-crafted frequency annealing strategy to recover\n3D scenes with imperfect camera poses. The strategy exploits a temporal\nlow-pass filter to guarantee convergence while decelerating the joint\noptimization of implicit scene reconstruction and camera registration. In this\nwork, we introduce the Frequency Adapted Bundle Adjusting Radiance Field\n(FA-BARF), substituting the temporal low-pass filter for a frequency-adapted\nspatial low-pass filter to address the decelerating problem. We establish a\ntheoretical framework to interpret the relationship between position encoding\nof NeRF and camera registration and show that our frequency-adapted filter can\nmitigate frequency fluctuation caused by the temporal filter. Furthermore, we\nshow that applying a spatial low-pass filter in NeRF can optimize camera poses\nproductively through radial uncertainty overlaps among various views. Extensive\nexperiments show that FA-BARF can accelerate the joint optimization process\nunder little perturbations in object-centric scenes and recover real-world\nscenes with unknown camera poses. This implies wider possibilities for NeRF\napplied in dense 3D mapping and reconstruction under real-time requirements.\nThe code will be released upon paper acceptance.",

Semiconductors are desired for many\napplications, but they represent a minor portion compared to the predominantly\nmetallic and half-metallic members of the Heusler family. Recently,\nvacancy-filling off-stoichiometric Heuslers of ternary X1+bYZ (0 <= b <= 1) and\nquaternary XaX'bYZ (1 <= a + b <= 2) have emerged as a more versatile strategy.\nHowever, the flexibility associated with off-stoichiometry inevitably leads to\ncomplications, including issues with fractional filling ratios and complex site\noccupations. This work presents a comprehensive landscape of\ntransition-metal-containing Heusler semiconductors, focusing on the\noff-stoichiometric Heuslers but seamlessly encompassing the\ninteger-stoichiometric systems. The structural and electronic properties can be\ntheoretically understood through a few simple rules.

To fill this gap, we introduce a generic multi-agent\nsystem for video stylization, V-Stylist, by a novel collaboration and\nreflection paradigm of multi-modal large language models. Specifically, our\nV-Stylist is a systematical workflow with three key roles: (1) Video Parser\ndecomposes the input video into a number of shots and generates their text\nprompts of key shot content. Via a concise video-to-shot prompting paradigm, it\nallows our V-Stylist to effectively handle videos with complex transitions. (2)\nStyle Parser identifies the style in the user query and progressively search\nthe matched style model from a style tree. Via a robust tree-of-thought\nsearching paradigm, it allows our V-Stylist to precisely specify vague style\npreference in the open user query. (3) Style Artist leverages the matched model\nto render all the video shots into the required style. Via a novel multi-round\nself-reflection paradigm, it allows our V-Stylist to adaptively adjust detail\ncontrol, according to the style requirement. With such a distinct design of\nmimicking human professionals, our V-Stylist achieves a major breakthrough over\nthe primary challenges for effective and automatic video stylization.\nMoreover,we further construct a new benchmark Text-driven Video Stylization\nBenchmark (TVSBench), which fills the gap to assess stylization of complex\nvideos on open user queries. Extensive experiments show that, V-Stylist\nachieves the state-of-the-art, e.g.,V-Stylist surpasses FRESCO and ControlVideo\nby 6.05% and 4.51% respectively in overall average metrics, marking a\nsignificant advance in video stylization.",

The CO-to-H$_2$\n($X_{\\rm CO}$) and the [CI]-to-H$_2$ ($X_{\\rm CI}$) conversion factors are\nwidely used to estimate the molecular mass content in galaxies. However, these\nfactors depend on many ISM environmental parameters.

We used the PDFchem\nalgorithm, coupled with a database of 3D-PDR models. These account for a wide\nrange of metallicities, dust-to-gas mass ratios, FUV intensities, and\ncosmic-ray ionization rates. The conversion factors were computed by\nintegrating the PDR properties over log-normal column density distributions\n($A_{\\rm V}$-PDFs) representing various cloud types. The $X_{\\rm CO}$ factor\nincreases significantly with decreasing metallicity, exceeding $\\sim\\!\\!1000$\ntimes the Galactic value at ${\\rm [O/H] = -1.0}$ under $\\alpha$-enhanced\nconditions, as opposed to $\\sim\\!\\!300$ times under non-$\\alpha$-enhanced\nconditions (${\\rm [C/O]=0}$).

The fraction of `CO-dark'\nmolecular gas increases dramatically in low-metallicity regions, exceeding 90\\%\nat ${\\rm [O/H] = -1.0}$, particularly in diffuse clouds and environments with\nstrong FUV radiation fields.

By designing a matching loss between input features\nand class-specific prototypes using contrastive learning, our method addresses\ninter-class homogeneity and guides the model to generate more accurate CAMs.\nExperiments on four datasets (LUAD-HistoSeg, BCSS-WSSS, GCSS, and BCSS) show\nthat our method outperforms existing weakly supervised segmentation approaches,\nsetting new benchmarks in histopathological image segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved notable performance in the fields\nof computer vision and natural language processing with various applications in\nboth academia and industry. However, with recent advancements in DNNs and\ntransformer models with a tremendous number of parameters, deploying these\nlarge models on edge devices causes serious issues such as high runtime and\nmemory consumption. This is especially concerning with the recent large-scale\nfoundation models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Large Language Models\n(LLMs). Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one of the prominent techniques proposed\nto address the aforementioned problems using a teacher-student architecture.\nMore specifically, a lightweight student model is trained using additional\nknowledge from a cumbersome teacher model. In this work, a comprehensive survey\nof knowledge distillation methods is proposed. This includes reviewing KD from\ndifferent aspects: distillation sources, distillation schemes, distillation\nalgorithms, distillation by modalities, applications of distillation, and\ncomparison among existing methods. In contrast to most existing surveys, which\nare either outdated or simply update former surveys, this work proposes a\ncomprehensive survey with a new point of view and representation structure that\ncategorizes and investigates the most recent methods in knowledge distillation.\nThis survey considers various critically important subcategories, including KD\nfor diffusion models, 3D inputs, foundational models, transformers, and LLMs.\nFurthermore, existing challenges in KD and possible future research directions\nare discussed.

    "abstract": "Background: Data driven stratification of patients into biologically informed\nsubtypes holds promise for precision neuropsychiatry, yet neuroimaging-based\nclustering methods often fail to generalize across cohorts. While algorithmic\ninnovations have focused on model complexity, the role of underlying dataset\ncharacteristics remains underexplored. We hypothesized that cluster separation,\nsize imbalance, noise, and the direction and magnitude of disease-related\neffects in the input data critically determine both within-algorithm accuracy\nand reproducibility. Methods: We evaluated 4 widely used stratification\nalgorithms, HYDRA, SuStaIn, SmileGAN, and SurrealGAN, on a suite of synthetic\nbrain-morphometry cohorts derived from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult\ndataset. Three global transformation patterns were applied to 600\npseudo-patients against 508 controls, followed by 4 within-dataset variations\nvarying cluster count (k=2-6), overlap, and effect magnitude. Algorithm\nperformance was quantified by accuracy in recovering the known ground-truth\nclusters. Results: Across 122 synthetic scenarios, data complexity consistently\noutweighed algorithm choice in predicting stratification success.\nWell-separated clusters yielded high accuracy for all methods, whereas\noverlapping, unequal-sized, or subtle effects reduced accuracy by up to 50%.\nSuStaIn could not scale beyond 17 features, HYDRA's accuracy varied\nunpredictably with data heterogeneity. SmileGAN and SurrealGAN maintained\nrobust pattern detection but did not assign discrete cluster labels to\nindividuals. Conclusions: The study results demonstrate the impact of\nstatistical properties of input data across algorithms and highlight the need\nfor using realistic dataset distributions when new algorithms are being\ndeveloped and suggest greater focus on data-centric strategies that actively\nshape and standardize the input distributions.",

USV mission planning approach offers autonomous solutions for\nmonitoring, surveillance, and logistics. Existing approaches, which are based\non static methods, struggle to adapt to dynamic environments, leading to\nsuboptimal performance, higher costs, and increased risk of failure. This paper\nintroduces a novel mission planning framework that uses Large Language Models\n(LLMs), such as GPT-4, to address these challenges. LLMs are proficient at\nunderstanding natural language commands, executing symbolic reasoning, and\nflexibly adjusting to changing situations. Our approach integrates LLMs into\nmaritime mission planning to bridge the gap between high-level human\ninstructions and executable plans, allowing real-time adaptation to\nenvironmental changes and unforeseen obstacles. In addition, feedback from\nlow-level controllers is utilized to refine symbolic mission plans, ensuring\nrobustness and adaptability. This framework improves the robustness and\neffectiveness of USV operations by integrating the power of symbolic planning\nwith the reasoning abilities of LLMs. In addition, it simplifies the mission\nspecification, allowing operators to focus on high-level objectives without\nrequiring complex programming.

Despite the core role of the trigger, existing studies have commonly\nbelieved a perfect match between training-inference triggers is optimal. In\nthis paper, for the first time, we systematically explore the\ntraining-inference trigger relation, particularly focusing on their mismatch,\nbased on a Training-Inference Trigger Intensity Manipulation (TITIM) workflow.\nTITIM specifically investigates the training-inference trigger intensity, such\nas the size or the opacity of a trigger, and reveals new insights into trigger\ngeneralization and overfitting.\n  These new insights challenge the above common belief by demonstrating that\nthe training-inference trigger mismatch can facilitate attacks in two practical\nscenarios, posing more significant security threats than previously thought.\nFirst, when the inference trigger is fixed, using training triggers with mixed\nintensities leads to stronger attacks than using any single intensity. For\nexample, on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, mixing training triggers with 1.0 and 0.1\nopacities improves the worst-case attack success rate (ASR) (over different\ntesting opacities) of the best single-opacity attack from 10.61\\% to 92.77\\%.\nSecond, intentionally using certain mismatched training-inference triggers can\nimprove the attack stealthiness, i.e., better bypassing defenses. For example,\ncompared to the training/inference intensity of 1.0/1.0, using 1.0/0.7\ndecreases the area under the curve (AUC) of the Scale-Up defense from 0.96 to\n0.62, while maintaining a high attack ASR (99.65\\% vs. 91.62\\%).

Furthermore, Ferret consistently\noutperforms these methods across diverse memory budgets, underscoring its\nsuperior adaptability.

Conventional gait recognition\nmethods typically rely on silhouettes or skeletons. Despite their success in\ngait recognition for controlled laboratory environments, they usually fail in\nreal-world scenarios due to their limited information entropy for gait\nrepresentations. To achieve accurate gait recognition in the wild, we propose a\nnovel gait representation, named Parsing Skeleton. This representation\ninnovatively introduces the skeleton-guided human parsing method to capture\nfine-grained body dynamics, so they have much higher information entropy to\nencode the shapes and dynamics of fine-grained human parts during walking.\nMoreover, to effectively explore the capability of the Parsing Skeleton\nrepresentation, we propose a novel Parsing Skeleton-based gait recognition\nframework, named PSGait, which takes Parsing Skeletons and silhouettes as\ninput. By fusing these two modalities, the resulting image sequences are fed\ninto gait recognition models for enhanced individual differentiation. We\nconduct comprehensive benchmarks on various datasets to evaluate our model.\nPSGait outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal methods that utilize\nboth skeleton and silhouette inputs while significantly reducing computational\nresources. Furthermore, as a plug-and-play method, PSGait leads to a maximum\nimprovement of 10.9% in Rank-1 accuracy across various gait recognition models.\nThese results demonstrate that Parsing Skeleton offers a lightweight,\neffective, and highly generalizable representation for gait recognition in the\nwild.",

    "abstract": "A corrugated structure, rather than a smooth surface, is a characteristic\nfeature of insect wings (e.g., dragonfly wings), which enhances their\naerodynamic performance at low Reynolds numbers ($Re \\simeq O(10^3)$). However,\nthe mechanisms responsible for these improvements remain largely unexplored.\nPrevious studies have shown that a secondary vortex forms on a flat wing,\nopposite in sign to the leading-edge vortex (LEV). At $Re = 4000$, the lift\nenhancement in the corrugated wing is associated with vortex collapse and\nconfinement within the V-shaped region, a part of corrugated structure.\nConversely, when there was no lift improvement, the vortex remained intact and\nerupted without collapsing. In addition, the alternating vortices within the\nV-shaped region, comprising a negative vortex originating from the LEV and a\npositive vortex from the secondary vortex, induced a strong negative pressure,\nthereby further enhancing the lift. However, the working range of these\nmechanisms has yet to be investigated. In this study, lift enhancement was\ninvestigated over a broader Reynolds number range ($100 \\leq Re \\leq 4000$),\nfocusing on the effective ranges. No characteristic mechanism was observed for\n$100 \\leq Re \\leq 500$. For $1000 \\leq Re \\leq 4000$, the alternating vortices\naround the V-shaped region were correlated with the improved aerodynamic\nperformance. Furthermore, for $2000 \\leq Re \\leq 4000$, the secondary vortex\ncollapse plays a major role in lift enhancement. These findings demonstrate\nthat the lift enhancement mechanisms for corrugated wings operate within\ndistinct working ranges depending on the Reynolds number, thereby providing\ninsights into bioinspired aerodynamic designs.",

We investigate systematically the\nevolution of electronic band dispersions of 1T-TaS2-xSex (0=<x=<2) using\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Our results show that the Se\nsubstitution induces a quantum transition from an insulating to a pseudogap\nmetallic phase with the CDW order preserved. Moreover, the asymmetry of the\npseudogap spectral function is found, which reflects the chiral nature of CDW\nstructure. The present observation is contrasted with the previous suggestions\nof a Mott transition driven by band width control or charge transfer. Instead,\nwe attribute the pseudogap phase to a disordered Mott insulator in line with\nthe recent observation of substantial lateral electronic disorder.

However, most existing\nworks focus on the regret upper bounds instead of lower bounds. To our\nknowledge, the only lower bound is from Jia et al.

In this paper, to overcome the\nlimitations of Jia et al. (2024), we consider the general variance sequence\nunder two settings.

Existing approaches to address this are founded\non the implicit premise that visual aesthetics is universal, which is limiting.\nAesthetics in the T2I context should be about personalization and we propose\nthe novel task of aesthetics alignment which seeks to align user-specified\naesthetics with the T2I generation output.

    "abstract": "In audio spoofing detection, most studies rely on clean datasets, making\nmodels susceptible to real-world post-processing attacks, such as channel\ncompression and noise. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Adaptive\nMixtUre Low-rank ExperTs (AMULET) framework, which enhances resilience by\nleveraging attack-specific knowledge and dynamically adapting to varied attack\nconditions. Specifically, AMULET employs Attack-Specific Experts (ASEs)\nfine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), allowing each expert to focus on\ndistinct post-processing patterns using just 1.13\\% of the parameters required\nfor full fine-tuning. Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive Expert Fusion (AEF),\nwhich adaptively selects and integrates expert knowledge to enhance the\nrobustness of spoofing detection. Experimental results demonstrate that AMULET\nsignificantly enhances robustness by improving noise resilience and exhibiting\ngreater adaptability to unseen post-processing methods compared to models\ntrained with full fine-tuning. Additionally, our framework outperforms both\nsingle expert and other expert aggregation strategies under various mixed\nattacks, demonstrating its superior robustness and adaptability in managing\ncomplex real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in LiDAR 3D detection have demonstrated the effectiveness of\nTransformer-based frameworks in capturing the global dependencies from point\ncloud spaces, which serialize the 3D voxels into the flattened 1D sequence for\niterative self-attention. However, the spatial structure of 3D voxels will be\ninevitably destroyed during the serialization process. Besides, due to the\nconsiderable number of 3D voxels and quadratic complexity of Transformers,\nmultiple sequences are grouped before feeding to Transformers, leading to a\nlimited receptive field. Inspired by the impressive performance of State Space\nModels (SSM) achieved in the field of 2D vision tasks, in this paper, we\npropose a novel Unified Mamba (UniMamba), which seamlessly integrates the\nmerits of 3D convolution and SSM in a concise multi-head manner, aiming to\nperform \"local and global\" spatial context aggregation efficiently and\nsimultaneously. Specifically, a UniMamba block is designed which mainly\nconsists of spatial locality modeling, complementary Z-order serialization and\nlocal-global sequential aggregator. The spatial locality modeling module\nintegrates 3D submanifold convolution to capture the dynamic spatial position\nembedding before serialization. Then the efficient Z-order curve is adopted for\nserialization both horizontally and vertically. Furthermore, the local-global\nsequential aggregator adopts the channel grouping strategy to efficiently\nencode both \"local and global\" spatial inter-dependencies using multi-head SSM.\nAdditionally, an encoder-decoder architecture with stacked UniMamba blocks is\nformed to facilitate multi-scale spatial learning hierarchically.

The problem of\nfine-grained radio map estimation is to utilize radio samples collected by\nsparsely distributed sensors to infer the map. This problem is challenging due\nto the ultra-low sampling rate, where the number of available samples is far\nless than the fine-grained resolution required for radio map estimation. We\npropose WiFi-Diffusion -- a novel generative framework for achieving\nfine-grained WiFi radio map estimation using diffusion models.

Extensive\nsimulations demonstrate that 1) the fine-grained radio map generated by\nWiFi-Diffusion is ten times better than those produced by state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) when they use the same ultra-low sampling rate; and 2) WiFi-Diffusion\nachieves comparable fine-grained radio map quality with only one-fifth of the\nsampling rate required by SOTA.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology\non cross-border trade using a qualitative content analysis approach. By\nsynthesizing existing empirical studies, we aim to quantify the overall effect\nof AI on trade flows and identify the key moderating and mediating variables.\nBesides, our results show that AI adoption significantly increases trade\nvolumes in Southeast Asia. Likewise, these effects are stronger in regions with\nadvanced technological infrastructure and favorable regulatory frameworks. In\naddition, Trade firm size partially mediates the relationship between AI\ntechnology and trade performance. Furthermore, this study draws on several key\ntheoretical frameworks that provide a comprehensive understanding of the\nmechanisms through which AI technology is affecting cross-border trade in\nSoutheast Asia. The primary theories used in this research include the\ntechnology, organization, and environment (TOE) framework, the diffuse\ninnovation (DOI) theory, Dynamic Capabilities Theory, Comparative Advantage\nTheory, Network theory, Transaction Cost Economics (TCE), the resource-based\nview, and the institution theory. Consequently, this study contributes to the\nexisting literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the role of AI in\ninternational trade and highlighting the importance of contextual factors in\nmaximizing the benefits of AI. Thus, our findings underscore the need for\nfavorable policies and robust infrastructure to facilitate AI-driven trade\ngrowth.

To address these, we propose an adaptive and efficient sparse\nTransformer architecture (Fraesormer) with two core designs: Adaptive Top-k\nSparse Partial Attention (ATK-SPA) and Hierarchical Scale-Sensitive Feature\nGating Network (HSSFGN). ATK-SPA uses a learnable Gated Dynamic Top-K Operator\n(GDTKO) to retain critical attention scores, filtering low query-key matches\nthat hinder feature aggregation.

In finance, LLMs\nfacilitate text generation, summarization, and entity extraction from complex\ndocuments.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the global population and the continuous decline in\ncultivable land pose significant threats to food security. This challenge\nworsens as climate change further reduces the availability of farmland.\nSoilless agriculture, such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics, offers a\nsustainable solution by enabling efficient crop cultivation in controlled\nenvironments. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with smart\nprecision farming improves resource efficiency, automates environmental\ncontrol, and ensures stable and high-yield crop production. IoT-enabled smart\nfarming systems utilize real-time monitoring, data-driven decision-making, and\nautomation to optimize water and nutrient usage while minimizing human\nintervention. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges of IoT-based\nsoilless farming, highlighting its role in sustainable agriculture, urban\nfarming, and global food security. These advanced farming methods ensure\ngreater productivity, resource conservation, and year-round cultivation.\nHowever, they also face challenges such as high initial investment,\ntechnological dependency, and energy consumption. Through a comprehensive\nstudy, bibliometric analysis, and comparative analysis, this research\nhighlights current trends and research gaps. It also outlines future directions\nfor researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to drive innovation\nand scalability in IoT-driven soilless agriculture. By emphasizing the benefits\nof vertical farming and Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA)-enabled\nsoilless techniques, this paper supports informed decision-making to address\nfood security challenges and promote sustainable agricultural innovations.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-3D generation saw dramatic advances in recent years by leveraging\nText-to-Image models. However, most existing techniques struggle with\ncompositional prompts, which describe multiple objects and their spatial\nrelationships. They often fail to capture fine-grained inter-object\ninteractions. We introduce DecompDreamer, a Gaussian splatting-based training\nroutine designed to generate high-quality 3D compositions from such complex\nprompts. DecompDreamer leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to decompose\nscenes into structured components and their relationships. We propose a\nprogressive optimization strategy that first prioritizes joint relationship\nmodeling before gradually shifting toward targeted object refinement. Our\nqualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art text-to-3D\nmodels demonstrate that DecompDreamer effectively generates intricate 3D\ncompositions with superior object disentanglement, offering enhanced control\nand flexibility in 3D generation.

Hence, high quality and fast mapping becomes a\nfundamental problem. With the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as an\nexplicit representation with excellent rendering quality and speed,\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) works introduce GS to SLAM. Compared to classical\npointcloud-SLAM, GS-SLAM generates photometric information by learning from\ninput camera views and synthesize unseen views with high-quality textures.\nHowever, these GS-SLAM fail when moving objects occupy the scene that violate\nthe static assumption of bundle adjustment. The failed updates of moving GS\naffects the static GS and contaminates the full map over long frames. Although\nsome efforts have been made by concurrent works to consider moving objects for\nGS-SLAM, they simply detect and remove the moving regions from GS rendering\n(\"anti'' dynamic GS-SLAM), where only the static background could benefit from\nGS. To this end, we propose the first real-time GS-SLAM, \"DynaGSLAM'', that\nachieves high-quality online GS rendering, tracking, motion predictions of\nmoving objects in dynamic scenes while jointly estimating accurate ego motion.\nOur DynaGSLAM outperforms SOTA static & \"Anti'' dynamic GS-SLAM on three\ndynamic real datasets, while keeping speed and memory efficiency in practice.",

Addressing these shortcomings, we introduce Snapmoji, an avatar\ngeneration system that instantly creates animatable, dual-stylized avatars from\na selfie. We propose Gaussian Domain Adaptation (GDA), which is pre-trained on\nlarge-scale Gaussian models using 3D data from sources such as Objaverse and\nfine-tuned with 2D style transfer tasks, endowing it with a rich 3D prior. This\nenables Snapmoji to transform a selfie into a primary stylized avatar, like the\nBitmoji style, and apply a secondary style, such as Plastic Toy or Alien, all\nwhile preserving the user's identity and the primary style's integrity. Our\nsystem is capable of producing 3D Gaussian avatars that support dynamic\nanimation, including accurate facial expression transfer. Designed for\nefficiency, Snapmoji achieves selfie-to-avatar conversion in just 0.9 seconds\nand supports real-time interactions on mobile devices at 30 to 40 frames per\nsecond.

We show that this result can explain why the PNLF cutoff is so\ninsensitive to population age.

A combinatorial criterion for\ntopological minimality of a solenoid, is introduced. The primary tool we\nconstruct to study dynamics of solenoids is contained in the following theorem:\nWhen a given solenoid $X$ doesn't contain finite partial leaves, the space of\ntransverse measures of $X$, denoted $TM(X)$, is equal to the inverse limit of a\ncertain sequence of linear maps on convex cones. We use this machinery to show\nthat $TM(X)$ is a finite dimensional cone, and then to provide a combinatorial\ncriterion called ``Semi-Normality\" that allows us to recognize a wide class of\nuniquely ergodic solenoids.",

We investigate this question in the context of\npolaritonic rotational-vibrational spectra and report a new feature, the\ntwin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the usual primary resonant\npolariton splitting that arises from light-matter entanglement. Through\nab-initio calculations of HCl molecules and a corresponding model system\ncoupled to a cavity, we demonstrate that the twin-polariton persists in the\nmany-molecule case and follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength\nas the primary resonant polariton splitting. This finding reveals a novel\nmechanism to tune a quantum feature using a classical one, offering new\ninsights into the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.",

Under the TNO\nmanagement, the distribution of charging loads may exacerbate the local supply\ndemand imbalance in the power distribution network (PDN), which negatively\nimpacts the economic operation of the PDN. This paper proposes a profitsharing\nmechanism based on the principle of incentive compatibility for coordinating\nthe traffic network (TN) and the PDN to minimize the operation cost of PDN.\nUnder this mechanism, the scheduling process of the power traffic system is\ndivided into two stages. At the prescheduling stage, the TNO allocates traffic\nflow and charging loads without considering the operation of the PDN, after\nwhich the DNO schedules and obtains the original cost. At the rescheduling\nstage, the DNO shares part of benefits of the optimal operation to the TNO to\nredispatch the EV charging to obtain a more effective charging plan, thus\nminimize the overall cost of PDN. Then, a bilevel model is developed to\nsimulate the operation of the power traffic system with the proposed sharing\nscheme and identify the best sharing ratio. Finally, numerical results\ndemonstrate that the PDN can achieve the minimum total cost and simultaneously\nthe TN can also benefit from the proposed profit sharing mechanism.",

Experimental results\non both regression (California Housing, Wine Quality) and classification\n(MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10) tasks suggest that this decomposition enhances\ngeneralization and resists overfitting, especially when training data are\nsparse or noisy.

To mitigate the scarcity of traffic data while\nmaintaining data privacy, numerous Federated Traffic Knowledge Transfer (FTT)\napproaches have been developed, which use transfer learning and federated\nlearning to transfer traffic knowledge from data-rich cities to data-scarce\ncities, enhancing traffic prediction capabilities for the latter. However,\ncurrent FTT approaches face challenges such as privacy leakage, cross-city data\ndistribution discrepancies, low data quality, and inefficient knowledge\ntransfer, limiting their privacy protection, effectiveness, robustness, and\nefficiency in real-world applications.\n  To this end, we propose FedTT, an effective, efficient, and privacy-aware\ncross-city traffic knowledge transfer framework that transforms the traffic\ndata domain from the data-rich cities and trains traffic models using the\ntransformed data for the data-scarce cities. First, to safeguard data privacy,\nwe propose a traffic secret transmission method that securely transmits and\naggregates traffic domain-transformed data from source cities using a\nlightweight secret aggregation approach. Second, to mitigate the impact of\ntraffic data distribution discrepancies on model performance, we introduce a\ntraffic domain adapter to uniformly transform traffic data from the source\ncities' domains to that of the target city. Third, to improve traffic data\nquality, we design a traffic view imputation method to fill in and predict\nmissing traffic data. Finally, to enhance transfer efficiency, FedTT is\nequipped with a federated parallel training method that enables the\nsimultaneous training of multiple modules.

In the commonly studied scenario of classification from compressed\nimages, a key objective is to enable learning directly on entropy-coded data,\nthereby bypassing the computationally intensive step of data reconstruction.\nConventional entropy-coding methods, such as Huffman and Arithmetic coding, are\neffective for compression but disrupt the data structure, making them less\nsuitable for direct learning without decoding. This paper investigates the use\nof low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes -- originally designed for channel\ncoding -- as an alternative entropy-coding approach. It is hypothesized that\nthe structured nature of LDPC codes can be leveraged more effectively by deep\nlearning models for tasks like classification. At the receiver side, gated\nrecurrent unit (GRU) models are trained to perform image classification\ndirectly on LDPC-coded data. Experiments on datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST,\nand CIFAR show that LDPC codes outperform Huffman and Arithmetic coding in\nclassification tasks, while requiring significantly smaller learning models.\nFurthermore, the paper analyzes why LDPC codes preserve data structure more\neffectively than traditional entropy-coding techniques and explores the impact\nof key code parameters on classification performance.

    "abstract": "Object state changes in video reveal critical information about human and\nagent activity. However, existing methods are limited to temporal localization\nof when the object is in its initial state (e.g., the unchopped avocado) versus\nwhen it has completed a state change (e.g., the chopped avocado), which limits\napplicability for any task requiring detailed information about the progress of\nthe actions and its spatial localization. We propose to deepen the problem by\nintroducing the spatially-progressing object state change segmentation task.\nThe goal is to segment at the pixel-level those regions of an object that are\nactionable and those that are transformed. We introduce the first model to\naddress this task, designing a VLM-based pseudo-labeling approach, state-change\ndynamics constraints, and a novel WhereToChange benchmark built on in-the-wild\nInternet videos. Experiments on two datasets validate both the challenge of the\nnew task as well as the promise of our model for localizing exactly where and\nhow fast objects are changing in video. We further demonstrate useful\nimplications for tracking activity progress to benefit robotic agents. Project\npage: https://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/spoc-spatially-progressing-osc",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces SagaLLM, a structured multi-agent architecture designed\nto address four foundational limitations of current LLM-based planning systems:\nunreliable self-validation, context loss, lack of transactional safeguards, and\ninsufficient inter-agent coordination. While recent frameworks leverage LLMs\nfor task decomposition and multi-agent communication, they often fail to ensure\nconsistency, rollback, or constraint satisfaction across distributed workflows.\nSagaLLM bridges this gap by integrating the Saga transactional pattern with\npersistent memory, automated compensation, and independent validation agents.\nIt leverages LLMs' generative reasoning to automate key tasks traditionally\nrequiring hand-coded coordination logic, including state tracking, dependency\nanalysis, log schema generation, and recovery orchestration. Although SagaLLM\nrelaxes strict ACID guarantees, it ensures workflow-wide consistency and\nrecovery through modular checkpointing and compensable execution. Empirical\nevaluations across planning domains demonstrate that standalone LLMs frequently\nviolate interdependent constraints or fail to recover from disruptions. In\ncontrast, SagaLLM achieves significant improvements in consistency, validation\naccuracy, and adaptive coordination under uncertainty, establishing a robust\nfoundation for real-world, scalable LLM-based multi-agent systems.",

Computation reuse is an emerging paradigm that leverages the execution\nresults of previous tasks to enhance the utilization of computational\nresources. While this paradigm has been extensively studied in terrestrial\nnetworks with abundant computing and caching resources, such as named data\nnetworking (NDN), it is essential to develop a framework appropriate for\nresource-constrained satellite networks, which are expected to have longer task\ncompletion times. In this paper, we propose CCRSat, a collaborative computation\nreuse framework for satellite edge computing networks. CCRSat initially\nimplements local computation reuse on an independent satellite, utilizing a\nsatellite reuse state (SRS) to assess the efficiency of computation reuse.\nAdditionally, an inter-satellite computation reuse algorithm is introduced,\nwhich utilizes the collaborative sharing of similarity in previously processed\ndata among multiple satellites. The evaluation results tested on real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that, compared to comparative scenarios, our proposed\nCCRSat can significantly reduce task completion time by up to 62.1% and\ncomputational resource consumption by up to 28.8%.",

However, enabling precise control of continuous\nattributes, especially multiple attributes simultaneously, in a new domain\n(e.g., numeric values like eye openness or car width) with text-only guidance\nremains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Attribute\n(Att) Adapter, a novel plug-and-play module designed to enable fine-grained,\nmulti-attributes control in pretrained diffusion models. Our approach learns a\nsingle control adapter from a set of sample images that can be unpaired and\ncontain multiple visual attributes. The Att-Adapter leverages the decoupled\ncross attention module to naturally harmonize the multiple domain attributes\nwith text conditioning. We further introduce Conditional Variational\nAutoencoder (CVAE) to the Att-Adapter to mitigate overfitting, matching the\ndiverse nature of the visual world. Evaluations on two public datasets show\nthat Att-Adapter outperforms all LoRA-based baselines in controlling continuous\nattributes. Additionally, our method enables a broader control range and also\nimproves disentanglement across multiple attributes, surpassing StyleGAN-based\ntechniques. Notably, Att-Adapter is flexible, requiring no paired synthetic\ndata for training, and is easily scalable to multiple attributes within a\nsingle model.",

    "abstract": "An $r$-block-coloring, simply $r$-coloring, of a Steiner triple system\n$\\mathrm{STS}(v)$ is a partition of the block set into $r$ color classes, each\ncolor class being a partial parallel class. The chromatic index of\n$\\mathrm{STS}(v)$, denoted by $\\chi^{\\prime}(v)$, is the smallest $r$ for which\nan $r$-coloring of an $\\mathrm{STS}(v)$ exists. A minimum colorable Steiner\ntriple system $\\mathrm{mcSTS}(v)$ is an $\\mathrm{STS}(v)$ admitting a\n$\\chi^{\\prime} (v)$-coloring. We generalize the notion of an $\\mathrm{RDSQS}$\n(a Steiner quadruple system $\\mathrm{SQS}$ with resolvable derived designs) to\n$\\mathrm{mcDSQS}$, representing an $\\mathrm{SQS}$ whose derived design at every\npoint is minimum colorable. This is motivated from an application in non-binary\ndiameter perfect codes. The purpose of this paper is to display a few recursive\nconstructions to produce $\\mathrm{mcDSQS}$s via Steiner systems\n$\\mathrm{S}(3,K,v)$ with certain properties. Among others, a construction for\n$\\mathrm{mcDSQS}$s is developed, which is also new even for $\\mathrm{RDSQS}$s;\nspecial constructions concentrating only on $\\mathrm{mcDSQS}(6n+2)$s are\ndemonstrated as well. As the main results, both a new infinite family of\n$\\mathrm{RDSQS}(6n+4)$s and the first infinite family of\n$\\mathrm{mcDSQS}(6n+2)$s are constructed. To be specific, an\n$\\mathrm{RDSQS}(2^{2m+1}+2)$ and an $\\mathrm{mcDSQS}(2\\cdot 9^{m}+2)$ are\nproved to exist, in which the former class gives rise to a new infinite family\nof large sets of Kirkman triple systems.

Moreover, creating substantial\nlabeled data in non-English languages and training these SOTA models from\nscratch is costly and time-consuming. We propose TSR as a language-agnostic\ncell arrangement prediction and introduce SPRINT, Script-agnostic Structure\nRecognition in Tables.

We show that\nwhen coupled with a pre-trained table grid estimator, SPRINT can improve the\noverall tree edit distance-based similarity structure scores of tables even for\nnon-English documents. We experimentally evaluate our performance across\nbenchmark TSR datasets including PubTabNet, FinTabNet, and PubTables-1M. Our\nfindings reveal that SPRINT not only matches SOTA models in performance on\nstandard datasets but also demonstrates lower latency. Additionally, SPRINT\nexcels in accurately identifying table structures in non-English documents,\nsurpassing current leading models by showing an absolute average increase of\n11.12%.

Despite the fact\nthat interesting theoretical work on PinT appeared as early 1964, it was not\nuntil 2004, when processor clock speeds reached their physical limit, that\nresearch in PinT took off. A distinctive characteristic of parallelization in\ntime is that information flow only goes forward in time, meaning that time\nevolution processes seem necessarily to be sequential. Nevertheless, many\nalgorithms have been developed over the last two decades to do PinT\ncomputations, and they are often grouped into four basic classes according to\nhow the techniques work and are used: shooting-type methods; waveform\nrelaxation methods based on domain decomposition; multigrid methods in\nspace-time; and direct time parallel methods. However, over the past few years,\nit has been recognized that highly successful PinT algorithms for parabolic\nproblems struggle when applied to hyperbolic problems. We focus in this survey\ntherefore on this important aspect, by first providing a summary of the\nfundamental differences between parabolic and hyperbolic problems for time\nparallelization. We then group PinT algorithms into two basic groups: the first\ngroup contains four effective PinT techniques for hyperbolic problems, namely\nSchwarz Waveform Relaxation with its relation to Tent Pitching; Parallel\nIntegral Deferred Correction; ParaExp; and ParaDiag. While the methods in the\nfirst group also work well for parabolic problems, we then present PinT methods\nespecially designed for parabolic problems in the second group: Parareal: the\nParallel Full Approximation Scheme in Space-Time; Multigrid Reduction in Time;\nand Space-Time Multigrid.",
