    "abstract": "This paper investigates the potential for large language models (LLMs) to\ndevelop private tonal languages for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication.\nInspired by cryptophasia in human twins (affecting up to 50% of twin births)\nand natural tonal languages like Mandarin and Vietnamese, we implement a\nprecise character-to-frequency mapping system that encodes the full ASCII\ncharacter set (32-126) using musical semitones. Each character is assigned a\nunique frequency, creating a logarithmic progression beginning with space (220\nHz) and ending with tilde (50,175.42 Hz). This spans approximately 7.9 octaves,\nwith higher characters deliberately mapped to ultrasonic frequencies beyond\nhuman perception (>20 kHz). Our implemented software prototype demonstrates\nthis encoding through visualization, auditory playback, and ABC musical\nnotation, allowing for analysis of information density and transmission speed.\nTesting reveals that tonal encoding can achieve information rates exceeding\nhuman speech while operating partially outside human perceptual boundaries.\nThis work responds directly to concerns about AI systems catastrophically\ndeveloping private languages within the next five years, providing a concrete\nprototype software example of how such communication might function and the\ntechnical foundation required for its emergence, detection, and governance.",

    "abstract": "While internet-scale image and textual data have enabled strong\ngeneralization in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the absence of internet-scale\ncontrol data has impeded the development of similar generalization in standard\nreinforcement learning (RL) agents. Although VLMs are fundamentally limited in\ntheir ability to solve control tasks due to their lack of action-conditioned\ntraining data, their capacity for image understanding allows them to provide\nvaluable feedback in RL tasks by recognizing successful outcomes. A key\nchallenge in Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is determining how\nbest to integrate VLM-derived signals into the learning process. We explore\nthis question in the context of offline RL and introduce a class of methods\ncalled Sub-Trajectory Filtered Optimization (SFO). We identify three key\ninsights. First, trajectory length plays a crucial role in offline RL, as\nfull-trajectory preference learning exacerbates the stitching problem,\nnecessitating the use of sub-trajectories. Second, even in Markovian\nenvironments, a non-Markovian reward signal from a sequence of images is\nrequired to assess trajectory improvement, as VLMs do not interpret control\nactions and must rely on visual cues over time. Third, a simple yet effective\napproach--filtered and weighted behavior cloning--consistently outperforms more\ncomplex RLHF-based methods. We propose Sub-Trajectory Filtered Behavior Cloning\n(SFBC), a method that leverages VLM feedback on sub-trajectories while\nincorporating a retrospective filtering mechanism that removes sub-trajectories\npreceding failures to improve robustness and prevent turbulence.

We assume that\na part of the objective function and the functional constraints exhibit local\nsmoothness.

This method incorporates a\nperturbation in the augmented Lagrangian function by scaling the dual variable\nwith a sub-unitary parameter. Furthermore, we linearize the smooth components\nof the objective and the constraints within the perturbed Lagrangian function\nat the current iterate, while preserving the nonsmooth components.

The orientation-based unification scheme of radio-loud active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs) asserts that radio galaxies and quasars are essentially the same\ntype of object, but viewed from different angles. To test this unification\nmodel, we compared the environments of radio galaxies and quasars, which would\nreveal similar properties when an accurate model is utilized. Methods. Using\nthe second data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS DR2), we\nconstructed a sample of 26,577 radio galaxies and 2028 quasars at 0.08 < z <\n0.4. For radio galaxies with optical spectra, we further classified them as\n3631 low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) and 1143 high-excitation radio\ngalaxies (HERGs). We crossmatched these samples with two galaxy cluster\ncatalogs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Results. We find that $17.1\n\\pm 0.2%$ of the radio galaxies and $4.1 \\pm 0.4%$ of the quasars are\nassociated with galaxy clusters. Luminous quasars are very rare in clusters,\nwhile $18.7 \\pm 0.7%$ LERGs and $15.2 \\pm 1.1%$ HERGs reside in clusters. We\nalso note that in radio galaxies, both HERGs and LERGs tend to reside in the\ncenters of clusters, while quasars do not show a strong preference for their\npositions in clusters. Conclusions. This study shows that local quasars and\nradio galaxies exist in different environments, challenging the\norientation-based unification model. This means that factors other than\norientation may play an important role in distinguishing radio galaxies from\nquasars. The future WEAVE-LOFAR survey will offer high-quality spectroscopic\ndata for a large number of radio sources and allow for a more comprehensive\nexploration of the environments of radio galaxies and quasars.",

Standard\nspeech tests do not fully capture such difficulties because the tests poorly\nresemble the context-rich, story-like nature of ongoing conversation and are\ntypically available only in a country's dominant/official language (e.g.,\nEnglish), leading to inaccurate scores for native speakers of other languages.\nAssessments for naturalistic, story speech in multiple languages require\naccurate, time-efficient scoring. The current research leverages modern large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in native English speakers and native speakers of 10\nother languages to automate the generation of high-quality, spoken stories and\nscoring of speech recall in different languages. Participants listened to and\nfreely recalled short stories (in quiet/clear and in babble noise) in their\nnative language. LLM text-embeddings and LLM prompt engineering with semantic\nsimilarity analyses to score speech recall revealed sensitivity to known\neffects of temporal order, primacy/recency, and background noise, and high\nsimilarity of recall scores across languages. The work overcomes limitations\nassociated with simple speech materials and testing of closed native-speaker\ngroups because recall data of varying length and details can be mapped across\nlanguages with high accuracy.

This running is inherited from the cosmic evolution of\nthe vacuum energy density (VED), $\\rho_{\\rm vac}$, which is sensitive to\nquantum effects in curved spacetime that ultimately trigger that running. The\nVED is a function of the Hubble rate and its time derivatives: $\\rho_{\\rm\nvac}=\\rho_{\\rm vac}(H, \\dot{H},\\ddot{H},...)$. Two nearby points of the cosmic\nevolution during the FLRW epoch are smoothly related as $\\delta\\rho_{\\rm\nvac}\\sim {\\cal O}(H^2)$. In the very early universe, in contrast, the higher\npowers of the Hubble rate take over and bring about a period of fast inflation.\nThey originate from quantum effects on the effective action of vacuum, which we\ncompute. Herein we focus on the lowest possible power for inflation to occur:\n$H^4$. During the inflationary phase, $H$ remains approximately constant and\nvery large. Subsequently, the universe enters the usual FLRW radiation epoch.\nThis new mechanism (`RVM-inflation') is not based on any supplementary\n`inflaton' field, it is fueled by pure QFT effects on the dynamical background\nand is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Superradiance can cause the axion cloud around a rotating black hole to reach\nextremely high densities, and the decay of these axions can produce a powerful\nlaser. The electric field of these lasers is strong enough that the Schwinger\neffect may become significant, resulting in the production of an\nelectron-positron plasma. We explore the dynamics between axion lasers and this\nelectron-positron plasma. While there are several mechanisms by which the\ninclusion of a plasma can impact the laser's behavior, the most significant of\nthese mechanisms is that the electron-positron plasma imparts an effective mass\non the photon. As the plasma frequency increases, axion decay becomes\nenergetically unfavorable, up to the point where the axion no longer decays\ninto photons, shutting off the laser. We find that the impact of the\nelectron-positron plasma on the dynamics of the system depend heavily on the\nparameters, specifically the axion mass $m_\\phi$ and the superradiant coupling\n$\\alpha$, and that we may divide parameter space into three regimes: the\nunenhanced, enhanced, and unstable regimes. In the unenhanced and enhanced\nregime, the system will eventually settle into an equilibrium state, emitting a\nlaser of constant luminosity while the number of axions remains constant. In\nthe unenhanced regime, this equilibrium state can be calculated while\nneglecting the effects of Schwinger production; in the enhanced regime, the\nequilibrium luminosity is slightly larger than what it would be without\nSchwinger production. In the unstable regime, the electron-positron plasma\nsuppresses axion decay to the point where the system is never able to reach\nequilibrium; instead, the axions continue to grow superradiantly. In all three\ncases, the production of superradiant axions will eventually cause the black\nhole to spin down to the point where superradiance ceases.",

Namely, we show that \\begin{equation*}\nR(F,\\mathbb{Z}_3) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} n+2, & \\text{if $F$ is $1\n(\\mathrm{mod}\\, 3)$ regular or a star;}\\\\ n+1, & \\text{if $3 \\nmid d(v)$ for\nevery $v \\in V(F)$ or $F$ has exactly one} \\\\ \\phantom{placeholder} &\n\\text{vertex of degree $0 (\\mathrm{mod}\\, 3)$ and all others are $1\n(\\mathrm{mod}\\, 3)$,} \\\\ \\phantom{placeholder} & \\text{and $F$ is not $1\n(\\mathrm{mod}\\, 3)$ regular or a star;}\\\\ n, & \\text{otherwise.} \\end{array}\n\\right. \\end{equation*} where $F$ is any forest on $n$ vertices with $3\\mid\ne(F)$ and no isolated vertices.",

Within\nthe usual definition, any frequency corresponds to a valid mode, and each\nfrequency is two-fold degenerate. Even within the continuous spectrum, the\nfundamental least-damped discrete quasinormal mode should dominate the\ndynamics, due to its lack of an incoming component at finite distances.

Normally, bipolar HVDC systems operate\nin balanced mode, i.e., near zero current flows through metallic or ground\nreturn. However, bipolar HVDC systems can also be operated in an unbalanced\nmode in case of a single converter pole or line conductor outage. A\nsteady-state analysis of the unbalanced DC network requires solving a power\nflow problem including various converter control modes, as the steady-state\nbehavior of the converters is governed by their control modes. This paper\npresents a comprehensive and unified power flow model for the balanced and\nunbalanced operation of bipolar HVDC grids, including various converter control\nmodes on the AC and DC sides of the converter, in a hybrid AC/DC system. It\nextends the basic control modes, developed for monopolar HVDC grids, to support\nthe balanced as well as unbalanced operation of bipolar HVDC grids.\nAdditionally, an AC-droop control, which defines a droop relationship between\nvoltage magnitude and reactive power at the AC side of the converter, is\nincorporated into the modeling of bipolar HVDC systems. The functionality of\nthe proposed model is demonstrated through a test case, and the power flow\nresults are validated using PSCAD simulations. The impact of converter control\nmodes on post-contingency system states is also investigated for single-pole\ncontingencies. The proposed model is implemented as an open-source tool in the\nJulia/JuMP framework, where larger test cases demonstrate the robustness of the\nmodel and tool.",

However, the quality of\ngenerated motion may degrade if the timing of these constraints is not\nperfectly consistent with the desired motion. Unfortunately, correctly\nspecifying keyframe timings is a tedious and challenging task in practice. Our\ngoal is to create a system that synthesizes high-quality motion from keyframes,\neven if keyframes are imprecisely timed. We present a method that allows\nconstraints to be retimed as part of the generation process. Specifically, we\nintroduce a novel model architecture that explicitly outputs a time-warping\nfunction to correct mistimed keyframes, and spatial residuals that add pose\ndetails. We demonstrate how our method can automatically turn approximately\ntimed keyframe constraints into diverse, realistic motions with plausible\ntiming and detailed submovements.",

To\nbridge this gap, we introduce TimeXL, a multi-modal prediction framework that\nintegrates a prototype-based time series encoder with three collaborating Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to deliver more accurate predictions and interpretable\nexplanations. First, a multi-modal prototype-based encoder processes both time\nseries and textual inputs to generate preliminary forecasts alongside\ncase-based rationales. These outputs then feed into a prediction LLM, which\nrefines the forecasts by reasoning over the encoder's predictions and\nexplanations. Next, a reflection LLM compares the predicted values against the\nground truth, identifying textual inconsistencies or noise. Guided by this\nfeedback, a refinement LLM iteratively enhances text quality and triggers\nencoder retraining. This closed-loop workflow -- prediction, critique\n(reflect), and refinement -- continuously boosts the framework's performance\nand interpretability. Empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that TimeXL achieves up to 8.9\\% improvement in AUC and produces\nhuman-centric, multi-modal explanations, highlighting the power of LLM-driven\nreasoning for time series prediction.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential as the\nnext-generation ranking-based recommendation system. Many recent works have\nshown that LLMs can significantly outperform conventional click-through-rate\n(CTR) prediction approaches. Despite such promising results, the computational\ninefficiency inherent in the current training paradigm makes it particularly\nchallenging to train LLMs for ranking-based recommendation tasks on large\ndatasets. To train LLMs for CTR prediction, most existing studies adopt the\nprevalent ''sliding-window'' paradigm. Given a sequence of $m$ user\ninteractions, a unique training prompt is constructed for each interaction by\ndesignating it as the prediction target along with its preceding $n$\ninteractions serving as context. In turn, the sliding-window paradigm results\nin an overall complexity of $O(mn^2)$ that scales linearly with the length of\nuser interactions. Consequently, a direct adoption to train LLMs with such\nstrategy can result in prohibitively high training costs as the length of\ninteractions grows. To alleviate the computational inefficiency, we propose a\nnovel training paradigm, namely Dynamic Target Isolation (DTI), that\nstructurally parallelizes the training of $k$ (where $k >> 1$) target\ninteractions. Furthermore, we identify two major bottlenecks - hidden-state\nleakage and positional bias overfitting - that limit DTI to only scale up to a\nsmall value of $k$ (e.g., 5) then propose a computationally light solution to\neffectively tackle each. Through extensive experiments on three widely adopted\npublic CTR datasets, we empirically show that DTI reduces training time by an\naverage of $\\textbf{92%}$ (e.g., from $70.5$ hrs to $5.31$ hrs), without\ncompromising CTR prediction performance.",

    "abstract": "Google's recent update to the manifest file for Chrome browser extensions,\ntransitioning from manifest version 2 (MV2) to manifest version 3 (MV3), has\nraised concerns among users and ad blocker providers, who worry that the new\nrestrictions, notably the shift from the powerful WebRequest API to the more\nrestrictive DeclarativeNetRequest API, might reduce ad blocker effectiveness.\nBecause ad blockers play a vital role for millions of users seeking a more\nprivate and ad-free browsing experience, this study empirically investigates\nhow the MV3 update affects their ability to block ads and trackers. Through a\nbrowser-based experiment conducted across multiple samples of ad-supported\nwebsites, we compare the MV3 to MV2 instances of four widely used ad blockers.\nOur results reveal no statistically significant reduction in ad-blocking or\nanti-tracking effectiveness for MV3 ad blockers compared to their MV2\ncounterparts, and in some cases, MV3 instances even exhibit slight improvements\nin blocking trackers. These findings are reassuring for users, indicating that\nthe MV3 instances of popular ad blockers continue to provide effective\nprotection against intrusive ads and privacy-infringing trackers. While some\nuncertainties remain, ad blocker providers appear to have successfully\nnavigated the MV3 update, finding solutions that maintain the core\nfunctionality of their extensions.",

    "abstract": "Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have become increasingly popular as\na powerful tool for providing personalized recommendation experiences. By\ndirectly engaging with users in a conversational manner to learn their current\nand fine-grained preferences, a CRS can quickly derive recommendations that are\nrelevant and justifiable. However, existing conversational recommendation\nsystems (CRSs) typically rely on a centralized training and deployment process,\nwhich involves collecting and storing explicitly-communicated user preferences\nin a centralized repository. These fine-grained user preferences are completely\nhuman-interpretable and can easily be used to infer sensitive information\n(e.g., financial status, political stands, and health information) about the\nuser, if leaked or breached. To address the user privacy concerns in CRS, we\nfirst define a set of privacy protection guidelines for preserving user privacy\nunder the conversational recommendation setting. Based on these guidelines, we\npropose a novel federated conversational recommendation framework that\neffectively reduces the risk of exposing user privacy by (i) de-centralizing\nboth the historical interests estimation stage and the interactive preference\nelicitation stage and (ii) strictly bounding privacy leakage by enforcing\nuser-level differential privacy with meticulously selected privacy budgets.\nThrough extensive experiments, we show that the proposed framework not only\nsatisfies these user privacy protection guidelines, but also enables the system\nto achieve competitive recommendation performance even when compared to the\nstate-of-the-art non-private conversational recommendation approach.",

This results in an autonomous\nsubsystem describing an unparametrized trajectory in the conformal superspace\nof metric and matter configurations, with its evolution encoded in an equation\nof state that characterises the intrinsic geometric properties of the curve in\nshape space. We show that this equation of state is structurally analogous to\nthe corresponding PSD description of the Newtonian $N$-body problem,\nreinforcing the fundamental similarity between gravity and relational particle\ndynamics. Our framework is applied to the homogeneous Bianchi IX cosmological\nmodel, demonstrating that the Janus point evolution through the Big Bang, as\npreviously found in a symmetry-reduced setting, is a generic feature of the\nfull inhomogeneous PSD description.

    "abstract": "In egocentric video understanding, the motion of hands and objects as well as\ntheir interactions play a significant role by nature. However, existing\negocentric video representation learning methods mainly focus on aligning video\nrepresentation with high-level narrations, overlooking the intricate dynamics\nbetween hands and objects. In this work, we aim to integrate the modeling of\nfine-grained hand-object dynamics into the video representation learning\nprocess. Since no suitable data is available, we introduce HOD, a novel\npipeline employing a hand-object detector and a large language model to\ngenerate high-quality narrations with detailed descriptions of hand-object\ndynamics. To learn these fine-grained dynamics, we propose EgoVideo, a model\nwith a new lightweight motion adapter to capture fine-grained hand-object\nmotion information. Through our co-training strategy, EgoVideo effectively and\nefficiently leverages the fine-grained hand-object dynamics in the HOD data.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple egocentric downstream tasks, including improvements\nof 6.3% in EK-100 multi-instance retrieval, 5.7% in EK-100 classification, and\n16.3% in EGTEA classification in zero-shot settings. Furthermore, our model\nexhibits robust generalization capabilities in hand-object interaction and\nrobot manipulation tasks.

The spatial coherence variation\nis achieved by controlling the spot size and transverse coherence length of the\nGaussian Schell model pump in the spontaneous parametric down conversion\nprocess. For a fixed beam size, the momentum correlation width of partially\ncoherent biphotons increases with the decreases in the transverse coherence\nlength. This results in a biphoton beam exhibiting multiple spatial modes,\nmaking it more suitable for studying the non-local features of quantum states\nin imaging, interference, and diffraction experiments. Our findings infer both\nhigh-quality and near-unity visibility of nonlocal interference using the\npartially coherent twin beams, even with the substantial decrease in the\ncoherence of the pump.

These limitations became\nparticularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring the need for\nmore accurate and informative models. Motivated by these challenges, we develop\na novel Bayesian epidemic modeling framework to better capture the complexities\nof disease spread by incorporating behavioral responses and undetected\ninfections.

While originally proposed to be a short-period binary, long-term\nspectroscopic monitoring suggested a 22.5 yr orbital period. With a derived\ndynamical mass of $2.03\\pm0.44\\,M_\\odot$, the qWR component is the most\nstrongly magnetized non-degenerate object ever detected and a potential\nmagnetar progenitor. However, the long period renders the spectroscopic orbital\nsolution and dynamical mass estimates uncertain, casting doubts on whether the\nqWR component is massive enough to undergo core-collapse. Here, we spatially\nresolve the HD 45166 binary using newly acquired interferometric data obtained\nwith the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. Due to\nthe calibrator star being a binary as well, we implement a new approach for\nvisibility calibration and test it thoroughly using archival GRAVITY data. The\nnewly calibrated HD 45166 data reveal the unmistakable presence of a companion\nto the qWR component with an angular separation of $10.9\\pm0.1$ mas (which\ntranslates to a projected physical separation of $10.8\\pm0.4$ au), consistent\nwith the long-period orbit. We obtain a model-independent qWR mass $M_{\\rm qWR}\n= 1.96^{+0.74}_{-0.54}\\,M_\\odot$ using interferometric and spectroscopic data\ntogether. This observation robustly confirms that HD 45166 is truly a\nlong-period binary, and provides an anchor point for accurate mass\ndetermination of the qWR component with further observations.",

ICP methods\nfail to consider that: (1) the points have well-defined semantic meaning, in\nthat each point can be related to a specific anatomical label; (2) the\ndeformation needs to follow biomechanical energy constraints. In this paper, we\npresent a novel semantic ICP (sem-ICP) method that handles multiple point\nlabels and uses linear elastic energy regularization. We use semantic labels to\nimprove the robustness of the closest point matching and propose a new point\ncloud deformation representation to apply explicit biomechanical energy\nregularization. Our experiments on the Learn2reg abdominal MR-CT registration\ndataset and a trans-oral robotic surgery ultrasound-CT registration dataset\nshow that our method improves the Hausdorff distance compared with other\nstate-of-the-art ICP-based registration methods. We also perform a sensitivity\nstudy to show that our rigid initialization achieves better convergence with\ndifferent initializations and visible ratios.",

    "abstract": "Defects in extrusion additive manufacturing remain common despite its\nprevalent use. While numerous AI-driven approaches have been proposed to\nimprove quality assurance, the inherently dynamic nature of the printing\nprocess poses persistent challenges. Regardless of how comprehensive the\ntraining dataset is, out-of-distribution data remains inevitable. Consequently,\ndeterministic models often struggle to maintain robustness and, in some cases,\nfail entirely when deployed in new or slightly altered printing environments.\nThis work introduces an agent that dynamically adjusts flow rate and\ntemperature setpoints in real time, optimizing process control while addressing\nbottlenecks in training efficiency and uncertainty management. It integrates a\nvision-based uncertainty quantification module with a reinforcement learning\ncontroller, using probabilistic distributions to describe printing segments.\nWhile the underlying networks are deterministic, these evolving distributions\nintroduce adaptability into the decision-making process. The vision system\nclassifies material extrusion with a certain level of precision, generating\ncorresponding distributions. A deep Q-learning controller interacts with a\nsimulated environment calibrated to the vision system precision, allowing the\nagent to learn optimal actions while demonstrating appropriate hesitation when\nnecessary. By executing asynchronous actions and applying progressively\ntightened elliptical reward shaping, the controller develops robust, adaptive\ncontrol strategies that account for the coupling effects between process\nparameters. When deployed with zero-shot learning, the agent effectively\nbridges the sim-to-real gap, correcting mild and severe under- and\nover-extrusion reliably. Beyond extrusion additive manufacturing, this scalable\nframework enables practical AI-driven quality assurance across various additive\nmanufacturing processes.",

    "abstract": "The seminal Haldane model brings up a paradigm beyond the quantum Hall effect\nto look for a plethora of topological phases in the honeycomb and other\nlattices. Here we dwell into this model considering a full parameter space in\nthe presence of spin-orbit interaction as well as Zeeman field such that the\nflavour of Kane-Mele model is invoked. Adopting this extended Haldane model as\nan example, we elucidate, in a transparent manner, a number of topological\nfeatures in a pedagogical manner. First, we describe various first order\ntopological insulator phases and their characterizations while explaining\nvarious anomalous quantum Hall effects and quantum spin Hall effects in the\nextended Haldane model. Second, we demonstrate the concepts of higher order\ntopological insulator phases along with the topological invariants in the\nanisotropic limit of the extended Haldane model. At the end, we discuss various\nopen issues involving \\textcolor{black}{emergent or extended} symmetries that\nmight lead to a broader understanding of various topological phases and the\nassociated criteria behind their emergence.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale organic liquid scintillator detectors are highly efficient in the\ndetection of MeV-scale electron antineutrinos. These signal events can be\ndetected through inverse beta decay on protons, which produce a positron\naccompanied by a neutron. A noteworthy background for antineutrinos coming from\nnuclear power reactors and from the depths of the Earth (geoneutrinos) is\ngenerated by ($\\alpha, n$) reactions. In organic liquid scintillator detectors,\n$\\alpha$ particles emitted from intrinsic contaminants such as $^{238}$U,\n$^{232}$Th, and $^{210}$Pb/$^{210}$Po, can be captured on $^{13}$C nuclei,\nfollowed by the emission of a MeV-scale neutron. Three distinct interaction\nmechanisms can produce prompt energy depositions preceding the delayed neutron\ncapture, leading to a pair of events correlated in space and time within the\ndetector. Thus, ($\\alpha, n$) reactions represent an indistinguishable\nbackground in liquid scintillator-based antineutrino detectors, where their\nexpected rate and energy spectrum are typically evaluated via Monte Carlo\nsimulations. This work presents results from the open-source SaG4n software,\nused to calculate the expected energy depositions from the neutron and any\nassociated de-excitation products. Also simulated is a detailed detector\nresponse to these interactions, using a dedicated Geant4-based simulation\nsoftware from the JUNO experiment. An expected measurable $^{13}$C$(\\alpha,\nn)^{16}$O event rate and reconstructed prompt energy spectrum with associated\nuncertainties, are presented in the context of JUNO, however, the methods and\nresults are applicable and relevant to other organic liquid scintillator\nneutrino detectors.",

This review explores the emerging role of\nGPCRs in sensing and responding to mechanical forces, with a particular focus\non the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular homeostasis is heavily influenced\nby mechanical forces such as shear stress, cyclic stretch, and pressure, which\nare central to both normal physiology and the pathogenesis of diseases like\nhypertension and atherosclerosis.

However, most medical imaging datasets are small, with\na limited number of annotated samples. The reason they are small is usually\nbecause delineating medical images is time-consuming and demanding for\noncologists. There are various techniques that can be used to augment a\ndataset, for example, to apply affine transformations or elastic\ntransformations to available images, or to add synthetic images generated by a\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN). In this work, we have developed a novel\nconditional variant of a current GAN method, the StyleGAN2, to generate\nmulti-modal high-resolution medical images with the purpose to augment small\nmedical imaging datasets with these synthetic images. We use the synthetic and\nreal images from six datasets to train models for the downstream task of\nsemantic segmentation. The quality of the generated medical images and the\neffect of this augmentation on the segmentation performance were evaluated\nafterward. Finally, the results indicate that the downstream segmentation\nmodels did not benefit from the generated images. Further work and analyses are\nrequired to establish how this augmentation affects the segmentation\nperformance.",

Our evaluation is conducted on four\nbenchmark datasets (KDD-CUP-1999, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017) using a\nshort and proportionally imbalanced dataset with a constant size of 5000\nsamples to ensure fairness in comparison. Results show that CAGN-GAT Fusion\ndemonstrates stable and competitive accuracy, recall, and F1-score, even though\nit does not achieve the highest performance in every dataset. Our analysis also\nhighlights the impact of adaptive graph construction techniques, including\nsmall changes in connections (edge perturbation) and selective hiding of\nfeatures (feature masking), improving detection performance. The findings\nconfirm that GNNs, particularly CAGN-GAT Fusion, are robust and computationally\nefficient, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments.\nFuture work will explore GraphSAGE layers and multiview graph construction\ntechniques to further enhance adaptability and detection accuracy.",

To address these limitations, we\npropose a novel Extrapolating and Decoupling framework, which introduces model\nmerging techniques to the I2V domain for the first time.

The design objectives for heat exchangers\ninclude maximizing the heat exchange rate while minimizing the pressure drop,\nrequiring both a large interface area and a smooth internal structure.\nState-of-the-art designs, such as triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS), have\nproven effective in optimizing heat exchange efficiency. However, TPMS designs\nare constrained by predefined mathematical equations, limiting their\nadaptability to freeform boundary shapes. Additionally, TPMS structures do not\ninherently control flow directions, which can lead to flow stagnation and\nundesirable pressure drops.\n  This paper presents DualMS, a novel computational framework for optimizing\ndual-channel minimal surfaces specifically for heat exchanger designs in\nfreeform shapes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to\ndirectly optimize minimal surfaces for two-fluid heat exchangers, rather than\nrelying on TPMS. Our approach formulates the heat exchange maximization problem\nas a constrained connected maximum cut problem on a graph, with flow\nconstraints guiding the optimization process. To address undesirable pressure\ndrops, we model the minimal surface as a classification boundary separating the\ntwo fluids, incorporating an additional regularization term for area\nminimization. We employ a neural network that maps spatial points to binary\nflow types, enabling it to classify flow skeletons and automatically determine\nthe surface boundary. DualMS demonstrates greater flexibility in surface\ntopology compared to TPMS and achieves superior thermal performance, with lower\npressure drops while maintaining a similar heat exchange rate under the same\nmaterial cost.",

    "abstract": "Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) is a sample-efficient method to\nlearn latent user utilities from preferential feedback over a pair of designs.\nIt relies on a statistical surrogate model for the latent function, usually a\nGaussian process, and an acquisition strategy to select the next candidate pair\nto get user feedback on. Due to the non-conjugacy of the associated likelihood,\nevery PBO step requires a significant amount of computations with various\napproximate inference techniques. This computational overhead is incompatible\nwith the way humans interact with computers, hindering the use of PBO in\nreal-world cases. Building on the recent advances of amortized BO, we propose\nto circumvent this issue by fully amortizing PBO, meta-learning both the\nsurrogate and the acquisition function. Our method comprises a novel\ntransformer neural process architecture, trained using reinforcement learning\nand tailored auxiliary losses. On a benchmark composed of synthetic and\nreal-world datasets, our method is several orders of magnitude faster than the\nusual Gaussian process-based strategies and often outperforms them in accuracy.",

However, as robots with complex\nphysical structures, learning a control model that can operate robustly across\ndiverse environments remains inherently challenging, particularly under the\ndiscrepancies between training and deployment environments. In this study, we\npropose HWC-Loco, a robust whole-body control algorithm tailored for humanoid\nlocomotion tasks. By reformulating policy learning as a robust optimization\nproblem, HWC-Loco explicitly learns to recover from safety-critical scenarios.\nWhile prioritizing safety guarantees, overly conservative behavior can\ncompromise the robot's ability to complete the given tasks. To tackle this\nchallenge, HWC-Loco leverages a hierarchical policy for robust control. This\npolicy can dynamically resolve the trade-off between goal-tracking and safety\nrecovery, guided by human behavior norms and dynamic constraints. To evaluate\nthe performance of HWC-Loco, we conduct extensive comparisons against\nstate-of-the-art humanoid control models, demonstrating HWC-Loco's superior\nperformance across diverse terrains, robot structures, and locomotion tasks\nunder both simulated and real-world environments.",

This paper introduces the design of an asynchronous\nIR-UWB integrated communication and localization (ICL) downlink network, which\nemploys unified waveforms to enable simultaneous data transmission and\nlocalization. A differential sequential detection strategy has been proposed\nfor data demodulation. To address errors caused by symbol misalignment, a novel\nsymbol confidence metric model is introduced to ensure reliable pulse detection\nand time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation. Additionally, an asynchronous\nstart-of-frame delimiter (SFD) detection model has been constructed to guide\nparameter optimization for practical applications. Furthermore, the clock drift\nestimation has been improved by leveraging the confidence metric within a\nmodified weighted least squares (MWLS) framework. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed system achieves reliable clock drift estimation,\ncommunication, and self-localization simultaneously. The operational range of\nthe confidence metric required for these outcomes is also quantified, providing\nvaluable insights for parameter design and system implementation.

    "abstract": "Since its introduction by J. Karamata, regular variation has evolved from a\npurely mathematical concept into a cornerstone of theoretical probability and\ndata analysis. It is extensively studied and applied in different areas. Its\nsignificance lies in characterising large deviations, determining the limits of\npartial sums, and predicting the long-term behaviour of extreme values in\nstochastic processes. Motivated by various applications, the framework of\nregular variation has expanded over time to incorporate random observations in\nmore general spaces, including Banach spaces and Polish spaces.\n  In this monograph, we identify three fundamental components of regular\nvariation: scaling, boundedness, and the topology of the underlying space. We\nexplore the role of each component in detail and extend a number of previously\nobtained results to general topological spaces. Our more abstract approach\nunifies various concepts appearing in the literature, streamlines existing\nproofs and paves the way for novel contributions, such as: a generalised theory\nof (hidden) regular variation for random measures and sets; an innovative\ntreatment of regularly varying random functions and elements scaled by\nindependent random quantities and numerous other advancements. Throughout the\ntext, key results and definitions are illustrated by instructive examples,\nincluding extensions of several established models from the literature.

In this paper, radar absorbing material of thickness 6.25\nmm is designed which givens more than -10 dB reflection loss from 4 to 18GHz of\nfrequencies. Next, the effect of rivet installation on these RAS is carried out\nusing three different rivet configurations.

In TM/Ni bilayers, the spin torque is contributed by three\nmechanisms including spin and orbital Hall current in TM, as well as\nself-torque in Ni.

For TM(5d heavy metal)/Ni bilayers, the\nspin torque induced by orbital Hall and self-torque in Ni nearly cancel each\nother, which makes the spin torque on Ni still align with that of the spin Hall\neffect in TM. Our work reveals much less efficient contribution of orbital Hall\nthan spin Hall effect on the spin torque in transition metal/ferromagnet\nbilayers.",

While deep learning (DL) shows promise in LDCT\nreconstruction, it requires large-scale data collection from multiple clients,\nraising privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) has been introduced to\naddress these privacy concerns; however, current methods are typically tailored\nto specific scanning protocols, which limits their generalizability and makes\nthem less effective for unseen protocols. To address these issues, we propose\nSCAN-PhysFed, a novel SCanning- and ANatomy-level personalized Physics-Driven\nFederated learning paradigm for LDCT reconstruction. Since the noise\ndistribution in LDCT data is closely tied to scanning protocols and anatomical\nstructures being scanned, we design a dual-level physics-informed way to\naddress these challenges. Specifically, we incorporate physical and anatomical\nprompts into our physics-informed hypernetworks to capture scanning- and\nanatomy-specific information, enabling dual-level physics-driven\npersonalization of imaging features. These prompts are derived from the\nscanning protocol and the radiology report generated by a medical large\nlanguage model (MLLM), respectively. Subsequently, client-specific decoders\nproject these dual-level personalized imaging features back into the image\ndomain. Besides, to tackle the challenge of unseen data, we introduce a novel\nprotocol vector-quantization strategy (PVQS), which ensures consistent\nperformance across new clients by quantifying the unseen scanning code as one\nof the codes in the scanning codebook.

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series data play a pivotal role in a wide range of\nreal-world applications. However, the presence of block missing data introduces\nsignificant challenges, often compromising the performance of predictive\nmodels. Traditional two-step approaches, which first impute missing values and\nthen perform forecasting, are prone to error accumulation, particularly in\ncomplex multivariate settings characterized by high missing ratios and\nintricate dependency structures. In this work, we introduce S4M, an end-to-end\ntime series forecasting framework that seamlessly integrates missing data\nhandling into the Structured State Space Sequence (S4) model architecture.\nUnlike conventional methods that treat imputation as a separate preprocessing\nstep, S4M leverages the latent space of S4 models to directly recognize and\nrepresent missing data patterns, thereby more effectively capturing the\nunderlying temporal and multivariate dependencies. Our framework comprises two\nkey components: the Adaptive Temporal Prototype Mapper (ATPM) and the\nMissing-Aware Dual Stream S4 (MDS-S4). The ATPM employs a prototype bank to\nderive robust and informative representations from historical data patterns,\nwhile the MDS-S4 processes these representations alongside missingness masks as\ndual input streams to enable accurate forecasting. Through extensive empirical\nevaluations on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that S4M\nconsistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Computing is increasingly central to innovation across a wide range of\ndisciplinary and interdisciplinary problem domains. Students across\nnoncomputing disciplines need to apply sophisticated computational skills and\nmethods to fields as diverse as biology, linguistics, and art. Furthermore,\ncomputing plays a critical role in \"momentous geopolitical events\", such as\nelections in several countries including the US, and is changing how people\n\"work, collaborate, communicate, shop, eat, travel, get news and entertainment,\nand quite simply live\". Traditional computing courses, however, fail to equip\nnon-computing discipline students with the necessary computing skills - if they\ncan even get into classes packed with CS majors. A pressing question facing\nacademics today is: How do we effectively integrate computing skills that are\nuseful for the discipline into discipline curricula?\n  We advocate an approach where courses in discipline X include the computing\nrelevant to the learning outcomes of that course, as used by practitioners in\nX. We refer to the computing skills relevant to a course in discipline X as an\n\"ounce of computing skills\", to highlight our belief regarding the amount of\ncomputing to be integrated in that course. In this article, we outline our\ninsights regarding the development of an ounce of computing skills for a\ndiscipline course, and the evaluation of the developed ounce. The key takeaways\nare that the goal has to be to advance students in their disciplines, and only\nthe disciplinary experts can tell us how computing is used in that discipline.\nComputer scientists know how to teach computing, but the classes can't be about\nCS values.

The\nability to diagnose and treat hypertension in the ambulatory population is\nhindered by limited access and poor adherence to current methods of monitoring\nblood pressure (BP), specifically, cuff-based devices. Remote\nphotoplethysmography (rPPG) evaluates an individual's pulse waveform through a\nstandard camera without physical contact. Cameras are readily available to the\nmajority of the global population via embedded technologies such as\nsmartphones, thus rPPG is a scalable and promising non-invasive method of BP\nmonitoring. The few studies investigating rPPG for BP measurement have excluded\nhigh-risk populations, including those with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or its\nrisk factors, as well as subjects in active cardiac arrhythmia. The impact of\narrhythmia, like atrial fibrillation, on the prediction of BP using rPPG is\ncurrently uncertain. We performed a study to better understand the relationship\nbetween rPPG and BP in a real-world sample of ambulatory patients from a\ncardiology clinic with established CVD or risk factors for CVD. We collected\nsimultaneous rPPG, PPG, BP, ECG, and other vital signs data from 143 subjects\nwhile at rest, and used this data plus demographics to train a deep learning\nmodel to predict BP. We report that facial rPPG yields a signal that is\ncomparable to finger PPG. Pulse wave analysis (PWA)-based BP estimates on this\ncohort performed comparably to studies on healthier subjects, and notably, the\naccuracy of BP prediction in subjects with atrial fibrillation was not inferior\nto subjects with normal sinus rhythm.

We introduce\nDreamPrinting, a novel pipeline that transforms radiance-based volumetric\nrepresentations into explicit, material-centric Volumetric Printing Primitives\n(VPPs). While volumetric rendering primitives (e.g., NeRF) excel at capturing\nintricate geometry and appearance, they lack the physical constraints necessary\nfor real-world fabrication, such as pigment compatibility and material density.\nDreamPrinting addresses these challenges by integrating the Kubelka-Munk model\nwith a spectrophotometric calibration process to characterize and mix pigments\nfor accurate reproduction of color and translucency. The result is a\ncontinuous-to-discrete mapping that determines optimal pigment concentrations\nfor each voxel, ensuring fidelity to both geometry and optical properties. A 3D\nstochastic halftoning procedure then converts these concentrations into\nprintable labels, enabling fine-grained control over opacity, texture, and\ncolor gradients. Our evaluations show that DreamPrinting achieves exceptional\ndetail in reproducing semi-transparent structures-such as fur, leaves, and\nclouds-while outperforming traditional surface-based methods in managing\ntranslucency and internal consistency. Furthermore, by seamlessly integrating\nVPPs with cutting-edge 3D generation techniques, DreamPrinting expands the\npotential for complex, high-quality volumetric prints, providing a robust\nframework for printing objects that closely mirror their digital origins.",

They fix the size of the unlabeled dataset and\nadjust the proportion of unseen classes within the unlabeled data to assess the\nimpact.

Compared with the mini-starbursts in the CMZ, Sgr B2 M and N, the three\nprotoclusters also show stronger subclustering in conjunction with a lack of\nmassive fragments. The efficiency of high-mass star formation of the three\nprotoclusters is on average one order of magnitude lower than that of Sgr B2 M\nand N, despite a similar overall efficiency of converting gas into stars. The\nlower efficiency of high-mass star formation in the three protoclusters is\nlikely attributed to hierarchical cluster formation.",

However, most existing forecasting\nmodels rely heavily on point-wise loss functions like Mean Square Error, which\ntreat each time step independently and neglect the structural dependencies\ninherent in time series data, making it challenging to capture complex temporal\npatterns accurately. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Patch-wise\nStructural (PS) loss, designed to enhance structural alignment by comparing\ntime series at the patch level. Through leveraging local statistical\nproperties, such as correlation, variance, and mean, PS loss captures nuanced\nstructural discrepancies overlooked by traditional point-wise losses.\nFurthermore, it integrates seamlessly with point-wise loss, simultaneously\naddressing local structural inconsistencies and individual time-step errors. PS\nloss establishes a novel benchmark for accurately modeling complex time series\ndata and provides a new perspective on time series loss function design.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that PS loss significantly improves the\nperformance of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets.",

Classification-based methods are not suitable for regression tasks\nbecause they cluster features into distinct groups without considering the\ncontinuous and ordered nature essential for regression. In a geometric aspect,\nwe uniquely focus on ensuring uniformity in the latent space for imbalanced\nregression through two key losses: enveloping and homogeneity. The enveloping\nloss encourages the induced trace to uniformly occupy the surface of a\nhypersphere, while the homogeneity loss ensures smoothness, with\nrepresentations evenly spaced at consistent intervals.

To determine accurate total stellar masses, GALFIT is applied to\nconsider the effects of the overlapping components on the photometric images to\nobtain accurate magnitudes. Then, based on the correlation between absolute\nPetrosian magnitudes and total stellar masses, the individual masses of the\ngalaxies are determined. Therefore, the maximum orbital velocities can be\ncalculated by combining the projected distance. Meanwhile, the peak separation\ncan be accurately measured after subtracting the pPXF determined host galaxy\ncontributions. Finally, four objects exhibit peak separations almost consistent\nwith their respective maximum orbital velocities under the assumption of a\ncircular orbit, while the remaining three objects display peak separations\nlarger than the maximum orbital velocities. A larger sample will be given later\nto further test whether DPNELs can arise from kpc-scale dual-core systems.",

    "abstract": "The WASP-47 system is notable as the first known system hosting both inner\nand outer low-mass planetary companions around a hot Jupiter, with an\nultra-short-period (USP) planet as the innermost planetary companion. The\nformation of such an unique configuration poses challenges to the lonely hot\nJupiter formation model. Hot Jupiters in multiple planetary systems may have a\nsimilar formation process with warm Jupiter systems, which are more commonly\nfound with companions. This implies that the WASP-47 system could bridge our\nunderstanding of both hot and warm Jupiter formation. In this work, we propose\na possible formation scenario for the WASP-47 system based on its orbital\nconfiguration. The mean motion resonance trapping, giant planet perturbations,\nand tidal effects caused by the central star are key factors in the formation\nof USP planets in multiple planetary systems with hot Jupiters. Whether a\nplanet can become an USP planet or a short period super-earth (SPSE) planet\ndepends on the competition between eccentricity excitation by nearby giant\nplanet perturbations and the eccentricity damping due to tidal effects. The\n$Q_p'$ value of the innermost planet is essential for the final planetary\nconfiguration. Our results suggest that a $Q_p'$ in the range of [1, 10] is\nfavorable for the formation of the WASP-47 system.

The velocity field is then\nconverted into a divergence-free, grid-based representation, enabling the\noptimization of simulation parameters through its differentiability across\nframes. This process results in simulation-ready fluid assets with physical\ndynamics closely matching those observed in the source video.

    "abstract": "With the rise of large language models, neural text summarization has\nadvanced significantly in recent years. However, even state-of-the-art models\ncontinue to rely heavily on high-quality human-annotated data for training and\nevaluation. Active learning is frequently used as an effective way to collect\nsuch datasets, especially when annotation resources are scarce. Active learning\nmethods typically prioritize either uncertainty or diversity but have shown\nlimited effectiveness in summarization, often being outperformed by random\nsampling. We present Diversity and Uncertainty Active Learning (DUAL), a novel\nalgorithm that combines uncertainty and diversity to iteratively select and\nannotate samples that are both representative of the data distribution and\nchallenging for the current model. DUAL addresses the selection of noisy\nsamples in uncertainty-based methods and the limited exploration scope of\ndiversity-based methods. Through extensive experiments with different\nsummarization models and benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that DUAL\nconsistently matches or outperforms the best performing strategies. Using\nvisualizations and quantitative metrics, we provide valuable insights into the\neffectiveness and robustness of different active learning strategies, in an\nattempt to understand why these strategies haven't performed consistently in\ntext summarization. Finally, we show that DUAL strikes a good balance between\ndiversity and robustness.",

Manipulation susceptibility was tested by inserting\nmisleading narratives and irrelevant details. Contextual awareness was\nrvaluated by comparing diagnoses with and without patient history. We analyzed\ndiagnostic change rates and response patterns across manipulations.\n  LLMs showed perfect diagnostic consistency for identical data but significant\nmanipulation susceptibility. Gemini had a 40% diagnosis change rate and ChatGPT\n30% with irrelevant details. ChatGPT had a higher context influence rate (77.8%\nvs. Gemini's 55.6%), but both showed limited nuanced contextual integration,\nexhibiting anchoring bias by prioritizing salient data over context.\n  LLMs' vulnerability to manipulation and limited contextual awareness pose\nchallenges in clinical use.

Experimental results on several popular datasets for fairness-aware\nmachine learning and well-known (fair) clustering models show that FACROC is a\nbeneficial method for visually evaluating the fairness of clustering models.",

    "abstract": "This work tackles 3D scene reconstruction for a video fly-over perspective\nproblem in the maritime domain, with a specific emphasis on geometrically and\nvisually sound reconstructions. This will allow for downstream tasks such as\nsegmentation, navigation, and localization. To our knowledge, there is no\ndataset available in this domain. As such, we propose a novel maritime 3D scene\nreconstruction benchmarking dataset, named as MTReD (Maritime Three-Dimensional\nReconstruction Dataset). The MTReD comprises 19 fly-over videos curated from\nthe Internet containing ships, islands, and coastlines. As the task is aimed\ntowards geometrical consistency and visual completeness, the dataset uses two\nmetrics: (1) Reprojection error; and (2) Perception based metrics. We find that\nexisting perception-based metrics, such as Learned Perceptual Image Patch\nSimilarity (LPIPS), do not appropriately measure the completeness of a\nreconstructed image. Thus, we propose a novel semantic similarity metric\nutilizing DINOv2 features coined DiFPS (DinoV2 Features Perception Similarity).\nWe perform initial evaluation on two baselines: (1) Structured from Motion\n(SfM) through Colmap; and (2) the recent state-of-the-art MASt3R model. We find\nthat the reconstructed scenes by MASt3R have higher reprojection errors, but\nsuperior perception based metric scores. To this end, some pre-processing\nmethods are explored, and we find a pre-processing method which improves both\nthe reprojection error and perception-based score. We envisage our proposed\nMTReD to stimulate further research in these directions. The dataset and all\nthe code will be made available in https://github.com/RuiYiYong/MTReD.",

This is achieved through a\nmany-to-one formula, which relates the average of a function over ancestral\nlineages sampled in the population processes to its average over the auxiliary\nprocess, yielding a direct interpretation of the underlying survivorship bias.\nIn addition, this construction allows for more general sampling procedures than\nwhat was previously obtained in the literature, such as sampling restricted to\nsubpopulations. Second, we consider the large population regime, when the\npopulation size grows to infinity. Under classical assumptions, the population\ntype distribution can then be approached by a diffusion approximation, which\ncaptures the fluctuations of the population process around its deterministic\nlarge population limit.

However, when applied to\nlarge-scale remote sensing scenes, 3D GS faces challenges: the point clouds\ngenerated by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) are often sparse, and the inherent\nsmoothing behavior of 3D GS leads to over-reconstruction in high-frequency\nregions, where have detailed textures and color variations. This results in the\ngeneration of large, opaque Gaussian ellipsoids that cause gradient artifacts.\nMoreover, the simultaneous optimization of both geometry and texture may lead\nto densification of Gaussian ellipsoids at incorrect geometric locations,\nresulting in artifacts in other views. To address these issues, we propose\nPSRGS, a progressive optimization scheme based on spectral residual maps.\nSpecifically, we create a spectral residual significance map to separate\nlow-frequency and high-frequency regions. In the low-frequency region, we apply\ndepth-aware and depth-smooth losses to initialize the scene geometry with low\nthreshold. For the high-frequency region, we use gradient features with higher\nthreshold to split and clone ellipsoids, refining the scene. The sampling rate\nis determined by feature responses and gradient loss. Finally, we introduce a\npre-trained network that jointly computes perceptual loss from multiple views,\nensuring accurate restoration of high-frequency details in both Gaussian\nellipsoids geometry and color.

The $perturbed$ sample voids have, on\naverage, smaller sizes and denser interiors. We filtered out voids based on\ndensity and radius in order to eliminate overdense and small spurious\ninstances. The stacked density profile of filtered voids in the $perturbed$\nsample remains close to the average density even at the boundary peak,\nindicating a strong blurring of structures by the redshift errors.

However, the\nissue of dendrite growth has emerged as a significant obstacle in battery\ndevelopment. Excessive dendrite growth during charging and discharging\nprocesses can lead to battery short-circuiting, degradation of electrochemical\nperformance, reduced cycle life, and abnormal exothermic events. Consequently,\nunderstanding the dendrite growth process has become a key challenge for\nresearchers. In this study, we investigated dendrite growth mechanisms in\nbatteries using a combined machine learning approach, specifically a\ntwo-dimensional artificial convolutional neural network (CNN) model, along with\ncomputational methods. We developed two distinct computer models to predict\ndendrite growth in batteries. The CNN-1 model employs standard convolutional\nneural network techniques for dendritic growth prediction, while CNN-2\nintegrates additional physical parameters to enhance model robustness. Our\nresults demonstrate that CNN-2 significantly enhances prediction accuracy,\noffering deeper insights into the impact of physical factors on dendritic\ngrowth. This improved model effectively captures the dynamic nature of dendrite\nformation, exhibiting high accuracy and sensitivity.

However, the existing solution is largely restricted to the samples\nfrom the current task, because of the poor accessibility to previous samples.\nTo promote the learning and transferring of diverse features across tasks, we\npropose a framework called Task-Agnostic Guided Feature Expansion (TagFex).\nFirstly, it captures task-agnostic features continually with a separate model,\nproviding extra task-agnostic features for subsequent tasks. Secondly, to\nobtain useful features from the task-agnostic model for the current task, it\naggregates the task-agnostic features with the task-specific feature using a\nmerge attention. Then the aggregated feature is transferred back into the\ntask-specific feature for inference, helping the task-specific model capture\ndiverse features. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and superiority\nof TagFex on various CIL settings. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/bwnzheng/TagFex_CVPR2025.",

However, as the number of parameters in\nsimulation-based scenario generation increases, the number of crash scenarios\nto simulate grows exponentially, making complete enumeration computationally\ninfeasible. Efficient sampling methods, such as importance sampling and active\nsampling, have been proposed to address this challenge. However, a\ncomprehensive evaluation of how domain knowledge, stratification, and batch\nsampling affect their efficiency remains limited.\n  This study evaluates the performance of importance sampling and active\nsampling in scenario generation, incorporating two domain-knowledge-driven\nfeatures: adaptive sample space reduction (ASSR) and stratification.\nAdditionally, we assess the effects of a third feature, batch sampling, on\ncomputational efficiency in terms of both CPU and wall-clock time. Based on our\nfindings, we provide practical recommendations for applying ASSR,\nstratification, and batch sampling to optimize sampling performance.\n  Our results demonstrate that ASSR substantially improves sampling efficiency\nfor both importance sampling and active sampling. When integrated into active\nsampling, ASSR reduces the root mean squared estimation error (RMSE) of the\nestimates by up to 90\\%. Stratification further improves sampling performance\nfor both methods, regardless of ASSR implementation. When ASSR and/or\nstratification are applied, importance sampling performs on par with active\nsampling, whereas when neither feature is used, active sampling is more\nefficient.

    "abstract": "Human living environment is influenced by intense solar activity. The solar\nactivity exhibits periodicity and regularity. Although many deep-learning\nmodels are currently used for solar cycle prediction, most of them are based on\na multi-step pattern. In this paper a solar cycle prediction method based on a\none-step pattern is proposed with the TCN neural network model, in which a\nnumber of historical data are input, and only one value is predicted at a time.\nThrough an autoregressive strategy, this predicted value is added to the input\nsequence to generate the next output. This process is iterated until the\nprediction of multiple future data. The experiments were performed on the\n13-month smoothed monthly total sunspot number data sourced from WDC-SILSO. The\nresults showed that one-step pattern fits the solar cycles from 20-25 well. The\naverage fitting errors are MAE=1.74, RMSE=2.34. Finally, the intensity of Solar\nCycle 25 was predicted with one-step pattern. The peak will occur in 2024\nOctober with a magnitude of 135.3 and end in 2030 November. By comparing the\nprediction results with other methods, our method are more reasonable and\nbetter than the most methods.

While previous work\nhas considered distortions caused by ego motion, distortions caused by other\nmoving objects remain largely overlooked, leading to errors in object shape and\nposition. This distortion is particularly pronounced in high-speed environments\nsuch as highways and in multi-LiDAR configurations, a common setup for heavy\nvehicles. To address this challenge, we introduce HiMo, a pipeline that\nrepurposes scene flow estimation for non-ego motion compensation, correcting\nthe representation of dynamic objects in point clouds. During the development\nof HiMo, we observed that existing self-supervised scene flow estimators often\nproduce degenerate or inconsistent estimates under high-speed distortion. We\nfurther propose SeFlow++, a real-time scene flow estimator that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on both scene flow and motion compensation. Since\nwell-established motion distortion metrics are absent in the literature, we\nintroduce two evaluation metrics: compensation accuracy at a point level and\nshape similarity of objects. We validate HiMo through extensive experiments on\nArgoverse 2, ZOD, and a newly collected real-world dataset featuring highway\ndriving and multi-LiDAR-equipped heavy vehicles.

Traditional geometric methods and recent\nlearning-based approaches frequently struggle with these structures, as both\nrely heavily on sufficient contextual information from local point\nneighborhoods. However, 3D measurement data of thin-walled structures often\nlack the accurate, dense, and regular neighborhood sampling required for\nreliable edge extraction, resulting in degraded performance.\n  In this work, we introduce STAR-Edge, a novel approach designed for detecting\nand refining edge points in thin-walled structures.

This representation is transformed into a\nrotation-invariant descriptor, which, combined with a lightweight multi-layer\nperceptron, enables robust edge point classification even in the presence of\nnoise and sparse or irregular sampling. Besides, we also use the local\nspherical curve representation to estimate more precise normals and introduce\nan optimization function to project initially identified edge points exactly on\nthe true edges.

Conversely, existing research on\ngeneralization in RL has always assumed scalar rewards, overlooking the\ninherent multi-objectivity of real-world problems. Generalization in the\nmulti-objective context is fundamentally more challenging, as it requires\nlearning a Pareto set of policies addressing varying preferences across\nmultiple objectives.

    "abstract": "As the penetration of Grid-Following inverters (GFL) in power systems\ncontinues to increase, the dynamic characteristics of power systems undergo\nsignificant transformations. Recently, modal analysis based on the impedance\nmodel (MAI) has been utilized to evaluate the interaction between GFLs and the\npower grid through impedance/admittance participation factors (PF). However,\nMAI relies on the impedance model that characterizes the input-output behavior\nof the ports, treating the GFL as a single integrated entity. This approach\nlimits its ability to reveal the complex dynamic coupling mechanism between\ndifferent control loops inside the GFL. In this paper, we propose an extended\nimpedance modal analysis (EMAI) method. Firstly, the equivalent dynamics of the\nGFL are decomposed into two components: the synchronous dynamic dominated by\nthe phase-locked loop (PLL) and the electromagnetic dynamic dominated by the\ncurrent control loop (CCL). The PF and participation ratios (PR) of these two\ndynamic components are then calculated to identify the dominant dynamics of the\nsystem. Building on this, we introduce the explicit parameter participation\nfactors (PPF) to further pinpoint the key parameters of the dominant control\nloop, which provides a way for enhancing system stability. Finally, the\neffectiveness of the proposed method is validated through the simulation of the\nmodified 14-bus and 68-bus systems. The EMAI method enables the analysis of the\ndynamic characteristics of each control loop in the GFL based on the impedance\nmodel. It can effectively identify the critical control loops influencing\nsystem stability without requiring the construction of a full state-space\nmodel, demonstrating its broad applicability and value.",

    "abstract": "Lateral charge transport of a two-dimensional (2D) electronic system can be\nmuch influenced by feeding a current into another closely spaced 2D conductor,\nknown as the Coulomb drag phenomenon -- a powerful probe of electron-electron\ninteractions and collective excitations. Yet the materials compatible for such\ninvestigations remain limited to date. Especially, gapped 2D semiconductors\nwith inherently large correlations over a broad gate range have been rarely\naccessible at low temperatures. Here, we show the emergence of a large drag\nresponse (drag resistance $R_{\\text{drag}}$ at the order of k$\\Omega$, with a\npassive-to-active drag ratio up to $\\sim$ 0.6) in a semiconductor-semimetal\nhybrid, realized in a graphene-MoS$_{2}$ heterostructure isolated by an\nultrathin 3 nm hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) dielectric. We observe a\ncrossover of $T$ to $T^{2}$ dependence of $R_{\\text{drag}}$, separated by a\ncharacteristic temperature $T_{d} \\sim E_{F}/k_{F}d$ ($d$ being the interlayer\ndistance), in echo with the presence of a metal-insulator transition in the\nsemiconducting MoS$_{2}$. Interestingly, the current nanostructure allows the\ndecoupling of intralayer interaction-driven drag response by varying density in\none layer with that in the other layer kept constant. A large Wigner-Seitz\nradius $r_{s}$ ($>$ 10 within the density range of 1 to $4 \\times\n10^{12}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) in the massive Schr\\\"odinger carriers in MoS$_{2}$\nis thus identified to dominate the quadratic dependence of total carriers in\nthe drag system, while the massless Dirac carriers in graphene induce\nnegligible drag responses as a function of carrier density. Our findings\nestablish semiconductor-semimetal hybrid as a platform for studying unique\ninteraction physics in Coulomb drag systems.",

    "abstract": "Assessing provincial carbon budgets for residential building operations is a\ncrucial strategy for advancing China's net-zero ambitions. This study is the\nfirst to employ a static-dynamic modeling approach to project future emission\ntrends, particularly carbon peaks, in residential buildings across each\nprovince of China up to 2060. An optimized provincial carbon budget assessment\nscheme for residential buildings, based on the principle of maximizing expected\nemission reduction potential, is also proposed. Findings show that (1) in the\nbusiness-as-usual scenario, the emissions for urban and rural residential\nbuildings are projected to peak at 990 (+-0.7) and 450 (+-0.2) mega-tons of CO2\n(MtCO2), respectively, with peak years occurring in 2031 (+-4.7) and 2026\n(+-2.6). (2) In the decarbonization scenario, peak emissions decrease to 900\nMtCO2 and 430 MtCO2 for urban and rural buildings, respectively. (3) The\nprovinces with the highest emission reduction requirements are Henan (16.74\nMtCO2), Xinjiang (12.59 MtCO2), Gansu (9.87 MtCO2), Hebei (8.46 MtCO2), and\nGuangdong (3.37 MtCO2), with Northwest China shouldering the greatest reduction\nresponsibility, totaling 38.14 MtCO2. In conclusion, this study provides a\ndynamically optimized carbon budget assessment scheme for residential\nbuildings, offering valuable insights for government policy-making and playing\na key role in facilitating the low-carbon transition of China's building sector\nduring the pre-2030 planning period, ultimately contributing to the goal of\nachieving net-zero emissions in the building sector by mid-century.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic models for biochemical reaction networks are widely used to\nexplore their complex dynamics but face significant challenges, including\ndifficulties in determining rate constants and high computational costs. To\naddress these issues, model reduction approaches based on deterministic\nquasi-steady-state approximations (QSSA) have been employed, resulting in\npropensity functions in the form of deterministic non-elementary reaction\nfunctions, such as the Michaelis-Menten equation. In particular, the total QSSA\n(tQSSA), known for its accuracy in deterministic frameworks, has been perceived\nas universally valid for stochastic model reduction. However, recent studies\nhave challenged this perception. In this review, we demonstrate that applying\ntQSSA in stochastic model reduction can distort dynamics, even in cases where\nthe deterministic tQSSA is rigorously valid. This highlights the need for\ncaution when using deterministic QSSA in stochastic model reduction to avoid\nerroneous conclusions from model simulations.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a multi-resolution reconstruction method for Electrical\nImpedance Tomography (EIT), referred to as MR-EIT, which is capable of\noperating in both supervised and unsupervised learning modes. MR-EIT integrates\nan ordered feature extraction module and an unordered coordinate feature\nexpression module. The former achieves the mapping from voltage to\ntwo-dimensional conductivity features through pre-training, while the latter\nrealizes multi-resolution reconstruction independent of the order and size of\nthe input sequence by utilizing symmetric functions and local feature\nextraction mechanisms. In the data-driven mode, MR-EIT reconstructs\nhigh-resolution images from low-resolution data of finite element meshes\nthrough two stages of pre-training and joint training, and demonstrates\nexcellent performance in simulation experiments. In the unsupervised learning\nmode, MR-EIT does not require pre-training data and performs iterative\noptimization solely based on measured voltages to rapidly achieve image\nreconstruction from low to high resolution. It shows robustness to noise and\nefficient super-resolution reconstruction capabilities in both simulation and\nreal water tank experiments. Experimental results indicate that MR-EIT\noutperforms the comparison methods in terms of Structural Similarity (SSIM) and\nRelative Image Error (RIE), especially in the unsupervised learning mode, where\nit can significantly reduce the number of iterations and improve image\nreconstruction quality.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the near-term behavior of a reactive agent is crucial in many\nrobotic scenarios, yet remains challenging when observations of that agent are\nsparse or intermittent. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising avenue\nby integrating textual domain knowledge with visual cues, but their one-shot\npredictions often miss important edge cases and unusual maneuvers. Our key\ninsight is that iterative, counterfactual exploration--where a dedicated module\nprobes each proposed behavior hypothesis, explicitly represented as a plausible\ntrajectory, for overlooked possibilities--can significantly enhance VLM-based\nbehavioral forecasting. We present TRACE (Tree-of-thought Reasoning And\nCounterfactual Exploration), an inference framework that couples\ntree-of-thought generation with domain-aware feedback to refine behavior\nhypotheses over multiple rounds. Concretely, a VLM first proposes candidate\ntrajectories for the agent; a counterfactual critic then suggests edge-case\nvariations consistent with partial observations, prompting the VLM to expand or\nadjust its hypotheses in the next iteration. This creates a self-improving\ncycle where the VLM progressively internalizes edge cases from previous rounds,\nsystematically uncovering not only typical behaviors but also rare or\nborderline maneuvers, ultimately yielding more robust trajectory predictions\nfrom minimal sensor data. We validate TRACE on both ground-vehicle simulations\nand real-world marine autonomous surface vehicles. Experimental results show\nthat our method consistently outperforms standard VLM-driven and purely\nmodel-based baselines, capturing a broader range of feasible agent behaviors\ndespite sparse sensing.

To\nevaluate the robustness of our proposed criteria, we employ string-induced\nhigh-resolution flat-sky CMB simulated patches of $7.2$ deg$^2$ size with a\nresolution of $0.42$ arc-minutes.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models transform an unknown data distribution into a Gaussian prior\nby progressively adding noise until the data become indistinguishable from pure\nnoise. This stochastic process traces a path in probability space, evolving\nfrom the original data distribution (considered as a Gaussian with near-zero\nvariance) to an isotropic Gaussian. The denoiser then learns to reverse this\nprocess, generating high-quality samples from random Gaussian noise. However,\nstandard diffusion models, such as the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model\n(DDPM), do not ensure a geodesic (i.e., shortest) path in probability space.\nThis inefficiency necessitates the use of many intermediate time steps, leading\nto high computational costs in training and sampling. To address this\nlimitation, we propose the Geodesic Diffusion Model (GDM), which defines a\ngeodesic path under the Fisher-Rao metric with a variance-exploding noise\nscheduler. This formulation transforms the data distribution into a Gaussian\nprior with minimal energy, significantly improving the efficiency of diffusion\nmodels. We trained GDM by continuously sampling time steps from 0 to 1 and\nusing as few as 15 evenly spaced time steps for model sampling. We evaluated\nGDM on two medical image-to-image generation tasks: CT image denoising and MRI\nimage super-resolution. Experimental results show that GDM achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance while reducing training time by a 50-fold compared\nto DDPM and 10-fold compared to Fast-DDPM, with 66 times faster sampling than\nDDPM and a similar sampling speed to Fast-DDPM.

    "abstract": "In conventional approaches for multiobject tracking (MOT), raw sensor data\nundergoes several preprocessing stages to reduce data rate and computational\ncomplexity. This typically includes coherent processing that aims at maximizing\nthe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), followed by a detector that extracts \"point\"\nmeasurements, e.g., the range and bearing of objects, which serve as inputs for\nsequential Bayesian MOT. While using point measurements significantly\nsimplifies the statistical model, the reduced data rate can lead to a loss of\ncritical, object-related information and, thus, potentially to reduced tracking\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a direct tracking approach that avoids a\ndetector and most preprocessing stages. For direct tracking, we introduce a\nmeasurement model for the data-generating process of the sensor data, along\nwith state-transition and birth models for the dynamics and the appearance and\ndisappearance of objects. Based on the new statistical model, we develop a\nfactor graph and particle-based belief propagation (BP) method for efficient\nsequential Bayesian estimation. Contrary to the track-before-detect (TBD)\nparadigm which also avoids a detector, direct tracking integrates coherent\nprocessing within the Bayesian MOT framework. Numerical experiments based on a\npassive acoustic dataset demonstrate that the proposed direct approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art conventional methods that rely on multiple\npreprocessing stages.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we aim to introduce distributed collaborative beamforming (DCB)\ninto AAV swarms and handle the eavesdropper collusion by controlling the\ncorresponding signal distributions. Specifically, we consider a two-way\nDCB-enabled aerial communication between two AAV swarms and construct these\nswarms as two AAV virtual antenna arrays. Then, we minimize the two-way known\nsecrecy capacity and maximum sidelobe level to avoid information leakage from\nthe known and unknown eavesdroppers, respectively. Simultaneously, we also\nminimize the energy consumption of AAVs when constructing virtual antenna\narrays. Due to the conflicting relationships between secure performance and\nenergy efficiency, we consider these objectives by formulating a\nmulti-objective optimization problem, which is NP-hard and with a large number\nof decision variables. Accordingly, we design a novel generative swarm\nintelligence (GenSI) framework to solve the problem with less overhead, which\ncontains a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE)-based generative method\nand a proposed powerful swarm intelligence algorithm. In this framework, CVAE\ncan collect expert solutions obtained by the swarm intelligence algorithm in\nother environment states to explore characteristics and patterns, thereby\ndirectly generating high-quality initial solutions in new environment factors\nfor the swarm intelligence algorithm to search solution space efficiently.\nSimulation results show that the proposed swarm intelligence algorithm\noutperforms other state-of-the-art baseline algorithms, and the GenSI can\nachieve similar optimization results by using far fewer iterations than the\nordinary swarm intelligence algorithm. Experimental tests demonstrate that\nintroducing the CVAE mechanism achieves a 58.7% reduction in execution time,\nwhich enables the deployment of GenSI even on AAV platforms with limited\ncomputing power.",

    "abstract": "We study the relaxation dynamics of the inertial Kuramoto model toward a\nphase-locked state from a generic initial phase configuration. For this, we\npropose a sufficient framework in terms of initial data and system parameters\nfor asymptotic phase-locking. It can be roughly stated as set of conditions\nsuch as a positive initial order parameter, a coupling strength sufficiently\nlarger than initial frequency diameter and intrinsic frequency diameter, but\nless than the inverse of inertia. Under the proposed framework, generic initial\nconfiguration undergoes three dynamic stages (initial layer, condensation and\nrelaxation stages) before it reaches a phase-locked state asymptotically. The\nfirst stage is the initial layer stage in analogy with fluid mechanics, during\nwhich the effect of the initial natural frequency distribution is dominant,\ncompared to that of the sinusoidal coupling between oscillators. The second\nstage is the condensation stage, during which the order parameter increases,\nand at the end of which a majority cluster is contained in a sufficiently small\narc. Finally, the third stage is the persistence and relaxation stage, during\nwhich the majority cluster remains stable (persistence) and the total\nconfiguration relaxes toward a phase-locked state asymptotically (relaxation).\nThe intricate proof involves with several key tools such as the\nquasi-monotonicity of the order parameter (for the condensation stage), a\nnonlinear Gr\\\"onwall inequality on the diameter of the majority cluster (for\nthe persistence stage), and a variant of the classical {\\L}ojasiewicz gradient\ntheorem (for the relaxation stage).",

In\nthis work, our aim is to understand why this CME led to such a geoeffective\noutcome. Our analysis spans from the source active region to the corona and\ninner heliosphere through 1 au using multiwavelength, multi-viewpoint remote\nsensing observations and in situ data. We find that rotation and possibly\ndeflection of the CME resulted in an axial magnetic field nearly parallel to\nthe ecliptic plane during the Earth encounter, which might explain the storm's\nseverity. Additionally, we find that imaging away from the Sun-Earth line is\ncrucial in hindcasting the CME Time-of-Arrival at Earth. The position (0.39 au)\nand detailed images from the SoloHI telescope onboard the Solar Orbiter\nmission, in combination with SOHO and STEREO images, helped decisively with the\nthree-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the CME.",

In practice, it is common to tune the learning rate\nhyperparameters through the grid search that (1) is computationally expensive\nas multiple runs are needed, and (2) increases the risk of data leakage as the\nselection of hyperparameters is data-dependent.

However,\nFS image faces problems such as image contamination and poor nuclear detail,\nwhich may disturb the pathologist's diagnosis. In contrast, formalin-fixed and\nparaffin-embedded (FFPE) image has a higher staining quality, but it requires\nquite a long time to prepare and thus is not feasible during surgery. To help\npathologists observe IHC images with high quality in surgery, this paper\nproposes a Cross-REsolution compensATed and multi-frequency Enhanced FS-to-FFPE\n(CREATE-FFPE) stain transfer framework, which is the first FS-to-FFPE method\nfor the intraoperative IHC images. To solve the slide contamination and poor\nnuclear detail mentioned above, we propose the cross-resolution compensation\nmodule (CRCM) and the wavelet detail guidance module (WDGM). Specifically, CRCM\ncompensates for information loss due to contamination by providing more tissue\ninformation across multiple resolutions, while WDGM produces the desirable\ndetails in a wavelet way, and the details can be used to guide the stain\ntransfer to be more precise. Experiments show our method can beat all the\ncompeting methods on our dataset.

    "abstract": "Humanoid robots are engineered to navigate terrains akin to those encountered\nby humans, which necessitates human-like locomotion and perceptual abilities.\nCurrently, the most reliable controllers for humanoid motion rely exclusively\non proprioception, a reliance that becomes both dangerous and unreliable when\ncoping with rugged terrain. Although the integration of height maps into\nperception can enable proactive gait planning, robust utilization of this\ninformation remains a significant challenge, especially when exteroceptive\nperception is noisy. To surmount these challenges, we propose a solution based\non a teacher-student distillation framework. In this paradigm, an oracle policy\naccesses noise-free data to establish an optimal reference policy, while the\nstudent policy not only imitates the teacher's actions but also simultaneously\ntrains a world model with a variational information bottleneck for sensor\ndenoising and state estimation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our\napproach markedly enhances performance in scenarios characterized by unreliable\nterrain estimations. Moreover, we conducted rigorous testing in both\nchallenging urban settings and off-road environments, the model successfully\ntraverse 2 km of varied terrain without external intervention.",

Our approach introduces a clustering-based\nbackdoor watermark (CBW), enabling dataset owners to determine whether a\nsuspicious third-party model has been trained on a protected dataset under a\nblack-box setting. The CBW method consists of two key stages: dataset\nwatermarking and ownership verification. During watermarking, we implant\nmultiple trigger patterns in the dataset to make similar samples (measured by\ntheir feature similarities) close to the same trigger while dissimilar samples\nare near different triggers. This ensures that any model trained on the\nwatermarked dataset exhibits specific misclassification behaviors when exposed\nto trigger-embedded inputs. To verify dataset ownership, we design a\nhypothesis-test-based framework that statistically evaluates whether a\nsuspicious model exhibits the expected backdoor behavior. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets, verifying the effectiveness and robustness\nof our method against potential adaptive attacks.

This paper\naims to develop a machine learning framework for predicting fracture toughness\nand crack initiation angles by directly utilizing stress, strain, or\ndisplacement distributions represented by selected nodes as input features.\nValidation is conducted using experimental data across various mode mixities\nand specimen geometries for brittle materials. Among stress, strain, and\ndisplacement fields, it is shown that the stress-based features, when paired\nwith Multilayer Perceptron models, achieve high predictive accuracy with R2\nscores exceeding 0.86 for fracture load predictions and 0.94 for angle\npredictions. A comparison with the Theory of Critical Distances (Generalized\nMaximum Tangential Stress) demonstrates the high accuracy of the framework.\nFurthermore, the impact of input parameter selections is studied, and it is\ndemonstrated that advanced feature selection algorithms enable the framework to\nhandle different ranges and densities of the representing field. The\nframework's performance was further validated for datasets with a limited\nnumber of data points and restricted mode mixities, where it maintained high\naccuracy.

While the self-attention\nmechanism, a core component of transformers, has proven capable of handling\ncomplex data patterns, it has been observed that the representational capacity\nof the attention matrix degrades significantly across transformer layers,\nthereby hurting its overall performance. In this work, we leverage the\nconnection between self-attention computations and low-pass non-local means\n(NLM) smoothing filters and propose the Twicing Attention, a novel attention\nmechanism that uses kernel twicing procedure in nonparametric regression to\nalleviate the low-pass behavior of associated NLM smoothing with compelling\ntheoretical guarantees and enhanced adversarial robustness. This approach\nenables the extraction and reuse of meaningful information retained in the\nresiduals following the imperfect smoothing operation at each layer. Our\nproposed method offers two key advantages over standard self-attention: 1) a\nprovably slower decay of representational capacity and 2) improved robustness\nand accuracy across various data modalities and tasks.

These CMEs are\ndifficult to characterize in coronagraph data due to their high speed (fewer\nobservations), faintness, Earthward orientation (halo CMEs), and disruptions\nfrom associated high-energy particle storms. Any diagnostic aiding in early CME\nspeed identification is valuable. This study investigates whether the 3D speeds\nof 37 CMEs are correlated with the critical heights of their source regions, to\ntest the hypothesis that if the critical height is located at a higher altitude\nin the corona, the weaker magnetic field environment will enable a faster CME\nto be produced. Critical heights near CME onset are calculated by identifying\npolarity inversion lines (PIL) in magnetogram data using automated and manual\nmethods. 3D speeds are determined by fitting a Graduated Cylindrical Shell\n(GCS) model to multi-viewpoint coronagraph images. For the automated method, we\nfind a high correlation of 71% +- 8% between CME speed and critical height,\ndropping to 48% +- 12% when using CME plane-of-sky speeds, on which most\nprevious similar studies are based. An attempt to improve the critical height\ndiagnostic through manual PIL selection yields a lower correlation of 58% +/-\n13%. The higher correlation from the automated method suggests that\nencompassing the full PIL structure is a better measure of the magnetic\nconditions that influence CME dynamics.

    "abstract": "We present an exact black hole solution surrounded by massive vector fields\npredicted by Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity. KK gravity in four dimensions (4D) is\nof particular interest, as it predicts a tower of particle states, including\ngravitons with spin-0 and spin-1 components, in addition to the massless spin-2\ngravitons of general relativity. The extra degrees of freedom in the\ngravitational sector modify the law of gravity, allowing the theory to explain\nthe effects attributed to dark matter in the universe. In this paper, we\nconstruct a black hole solution surrounded by massive spin-1 gravitons within\nKK theory. In addition to the influence of the massive vector fields, we\nincorporate an interaction term between the black hole and the massive vector\nfield. The black hole solution is affected by the mass of the spin-1 graviton\nand an additional parameter that encodes corrections to Newton's constant, as\nwell as the coupling between the massive vector field and the black hole mass.\nWe find that the coupling between the massive vector field and the black hole\nmimics the effect of an electric charge. To this end, we investigate the\naccretion disk, quasinormal modes (QNMs), and the stability of the black hole\nspacetime. Finally, we use Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A*\nto constrain the black hole parameters.",

    "abstract": "General continual learning (GCL) is a broad concept to describe real-world\ncontinual learning (CL) problems, which are often characterized by online data\nstreams without distinct transitions between tasks, i.e., blurry task\nboundaries. Such requirements result in poor initial performance, limited\ngeneralizability, and severe catastrophic forgetting, heavily impacting the\neffectiveness of mainstream GCL models trained from scratch. While the use of a\nfrozen pretrained backbone with appropriate prompt tuning can partially address\nthese challenges, such prompt-based methods remain suboptimal for CL of\nremaining tunable parameters on the fly. In this regard, we propose an\ninnovative approach named MISA (Mask and Initial Session Adaption) to advance\nprompt-based methods in GCL. It includes a forgetting-aware initial session\nadaption that employs pretraining data to initialize prompt parameters and\nimprove generalizability, as well as a non-parametric logit mask of the output\nlayers to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Empirical results demonstrate\nsubstantial performance gains of our approach compared to recent competitors,\nespecially without a replay buffer (e.g., up to 18.39%, 22.06%, and 11.96%\nperformance lead on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-R, respectively).\nMoreover, our approach features the plug-in nature for prompt-based methods,\nindependence of replay, ease of implementation, and avoidance of CL-relevant\nhyperparameters, serving as a strong baseline for GCL research.

    "abstract": "Reliable human-robot communication is essential for underwater human-robot\ninteraction (U-HRI), yet traditional methods such as acoustic signaling and\npredefined gesture-based models suffer from limitations in adaptability and\nrobustness. In this work, we propose One-Shot Gesture Recognition (OSG), a\nnovel method that enables real-time, pose-based, temporal gesture recognition\nunderwater from a single demonstration, eliminating the need for extensive\ndataset collection or model retraining. OSG leverages shape-based\nclassification techniques, including Hu moments, Zernike moments, and Fourier\ndescriptors, to robustly recognize gestures in visually-challenging underwater\nenvironments. Our system achieves high accuracy on real-world underwater data\nand operates efficiently on embedded hardware commonly found on autonomous\nunderwater vehicles (AUVs), demonstrating its feasibility for deployment\non-board robots. Compared to deep learning approaches, OSG is lightweight,\ncomputationally efficient, and highly adaptable, making it ideal for\ndiver-to-robot communication. We evaluate OSG's performance on an augmented\ngesture dataset and real-world underwater video data, comparing its accuracy\nagainst deep learning methods. Our results show OSG's potential to enhance\nU-HRI by enabling the immediate deployment of user-defined gestures without the\nconstraints of predefined gesture languages.",

    "abstract": "The evaluation of ranking tasks remains a significant challenge in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP), particularly due to the lack of direct labels for\nresults in real-world scenarios. Benchmark datasets play a crucial role in\nproviding standardized testbeds that ensure fair comparisons, enhance\nreproducibility, and enable progress tracking, facilitating rigorous assessment\nand continuous improvement of ranking models. Existing NLP ranking benchmarks\ntypically use binary relevance labels or continuous relevance scores,\nneglecting ordinal relevance scores. However, binary labels oversimplify\nrelevance distinctions, while continuous scores lack a clear ordinal structure,\nmaking it challenging to capture nuanced ranking differences effectively. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce OrdRankBen, a novel benchmark designed\nto capture multi-granularity relevance distinctions. Unlike conventional\nbenchmarks, OrdRankBen incorporates structured ordinal labels, enabling more\nprecise ranking evaluations. Given the absence of suitable datasets for ordinal\nrelevance ranking in NLP, we constructed two datasets with distinct ordinal\nlabel distributions. We further evaluate various models for three model types,\nranking-based language models, general large language models, and\nranking-focused large language models on these datasets. Experimental results\nshow that ordinal relevance modeling provides a more precise evaluation of\nranking models, improving their ability to distinguish multi-granularity\ndifferences among ranked items-crucial for tasks that demand fine-grained\nrelevance differentiation.",

    "abstract": "In software engineering chatrooms, communication is often hindered by\nimprecise questions that cannot be answered. Recognizing key entities can be\nessential for improving question clarity and facilitating better exchange.\nHowever, existing research using natural language processing techniques often\noverlooks these software-specific nuances. In this paper, we introduce\nSoftware-specific Named Entity Recognition, Intent Detection, and Resolution\nClassification (SENIR), a labeling approach that leverages a Large Language\nModel to annotate entities, intents, and resolution status in developer\nchatroom conversations. To offer quantitative guidance for improving question\nclarity and resolvability, we build a resolution prediction model that\nleverages SENIR's entity and intent labels along with additional predictive\nfeatures. We evaluate SENIR on the DISCO dataset using a subset of annotated\nchatroom dialogues. SENIR achieves an 86% F-score for entity recognition, a 71%\nF-score for intent detection, and an 89% F-score for resolution status\nclassification. Furthermore, our resolution prediction model, tested with\nvarious sampling strategies (random undersampling and oversampling with SMOTE)\nand evaluation methods (5-fold cross-validation, 10-fold cross-validation, and\nbootstrapping), demonstrates AUC values ranging from 0.7 to 0.8. Key factors\ninfluencing resolution include positive sentiment and entities such as\nProgramming Language and User Variable across multiple intents, while\ndiagnostic entities are more relevant in error-related questions. Moreover,\nresolution rates vary significantly by intent: questions about API Usage and\nAPI Change achieve higher resolution rates, whereas Discrepancy and Review have\nlower resolution rates. A Chi-Square analysis confirms the statistical\nsignificance of these differences.",
