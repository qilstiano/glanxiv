    "abstract": "Unlabeled motion planning involves assigning a set of robots to target\nlocations while ensuring collision avoidance, aiming to minimize the total\ndistance traveled. The problem forms an essential building block for\nmulti-robot systems in applications such as exploration, surveillance, and\ntransportation. We address this problem in a decentralized setting where each\nrobot knows only the positions of its $k$-nearest robots and $k$-nearest\ntargets. This scenario combines elements of combinatorial assignment and\ncontinuous-space motion planning, posing significant scalability challenges for\ntraditional centralized approaches. To overcome these challenges, we propose a\ndecentralized policy learned via a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The GNN enables\nrobots to determine (1) what information to communicate to neighbors and (2)\nhow to integrate received information with local observations for\ndecision-making. We train the GNN using imitation learning with the centralized\nHungarian algorithm as the expert policy, and further fine-tune it using\nreinforcement learning to avoid collisions and enhance performance. Extensive\nempirical evaluations demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our\napproach. The GNN policy trained on 100 robots generalizes to scenarios with up\nto 500 robots, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions by 8.6\\% on average and\nsignificantly surpassing greedy decentralized methods. This work lays the\nfoundation for solving multi-robot coordination problems in settings where\nscalability is important.",

    "abstract": "The growing digitization of education presents significant challenges in\nmaintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of educational content.\nTraditional systems often fail to ensure data authenticity and prevent\nunauthorized alterations, particularly in the evaluation of teachers'\nprofessional activities, where demand for transparent and secure assessment\nmechanisms is increasing. In this context, Blockchain technology offers a novel\nsolution to address these issues. This paper introduces a Blockchain-enhanced\nframework for the Electronic Platform for Expertise of Content (EPEC), a\nplatform used for reviewing and assessing educational materials. Our approach\nintegrates the Polygon network, a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, to securely\nstore and retrieve encrypted reviews, ensuring both privacy and accountability.\nBy leveraging Python, Flask, and Web3.py, we interact with a Solidity-based\nsmart contract to securely link each review to a unique identifier (UID) that\nconnects on-chain data with real-world databases. The system, containerized\nusing Docker, facilitates easy deployment and integration through API\nendpoints. Our implementation demonstrates significant cost savings, with a\n98\\% reduction in gas fees compared to Ethereum, making it a scalable and\ncost-effective solution.

    "abstract": "This study explores the performance of auctions in China's seasoned equity\noffering (SEO) market, both theoretically and empirically. In these auctions,\nissuers must commit to a pre-announced revenue target and a maximum number of\nshares available for auction. We use a common value framework to analyze this\nauction mechanism, detailing its operation, share allocation, and pricing. The\ntheoretical findings suggest that when buyers bid truthfully, the seller's\noptimal strategy is to set the total share quantity equal to the target revenue\ndivided by the reserve price. We demonstrate that committing to a target\nrevenue results in a higher level of truthful bidding compared to a standard\nuniform-price auction without any revenue commitment. We empirically test our\ntheoretical findings using data from China's SEO markets. First, we assess the\nimpact of various issuer strategies on firm-level SEO discounts, categorizing\nscenarios based on share availability and target revenue. We find that the\nscenario where the reserve price times the share quantity matches the target\nrevenue is the most optimal for sellers. Second, we examine bidding behavior\nand auction performance, showing that China's SEO uniform price auction\nperforms exceptionally well. Specifically, the actual issue prices are only\n0.029 below the truthful case prices, indicating that the revenue raised is\nstill close to what would have been achieved with truthful bids.",

Specifically, if the vorticity restricted to a quadrant\nis signed, sufficiently concentrated and close to its radial rearrangement up\nto a translation in $L^1$, we prove that it remains so for all times.\n  The main difficulty is that the kinetic energy maximization problem in a\nquadrant -- the typical approach for establishing vortex stability -- lacks a\nsolution, as the kinetic energy continues to increase when the vorticity\nescapes to infinity. We overcome this by taking dynamical information into\naccount: finite-time desingularization result is combined with monotonicity of\nthe first moment and a careful analysis of the interaction energies between\nvortices. The latter is achieved by new pointwise estimates on the Biot--Savart\nkernel and quantitative stability results for general interaction kernels.\nMoreover, with a similar strategy we obtain stability of a pair of\nopposite-signed Lamb dipoles moving away from each other.",

Recently, the Tracking Any Point (TAP) algorithm was proposed\nto overcome these limitations and achieve dense accurate long-term tracking.\nHowever, its efficacy in surgical scenarios remains untested, largely due to\nthe lack of a comprehensive surgical tracking dataset for evaluation. To\naddress this gap, we introduce a new annotated surgical tracking dataset for\nbenchmarking tracking methods for surgical scenarios, comprising real-world\nsurgical videos with complex tissue and instrument motions. We extensively\nevaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) TAP-based algorithms on this dataset and\nreveal their limitations in challenging surgical scenarios, including fast\ninstrument motion, severe occlusions, and motion blur, etc. Furthermore, we\npropose a new tracking method, namely SurgMotion, to solve the challenges and\nfurther improve the tracking performance.

We validate GCL using the BARN dataset on complex\nnavigation tasks, achieving a 6.8% and 6.5% higher success rate compared to a\nstate-of-the-art CL method and a curriculum designed by human experts,\nrespectively.

Since compound e-values are closed under\naveraging, this allows for combination and derandomization of arbitrary FDR\nprocedures. We then connect compound e-values to empirical Bayes. In\nparticular, we use the fundamental theorem of compound decision theory to\nderive the log-optimal simple separable compound e-value for testing a set of\npoint nulls against point alternatives: it is a ratio of mixture likelihoods.\nAs one example, we construct asymptotic compound e-values for multiple t-tests,\nwhere the (nuisance) variances may be different across hypotheses.

While the state-of-the-art SfM pipelines have\nreached a high level of maturity in well-textured and well-configured scenes\nover the last decades, they still fall short of robustly solving the SfM\nproblem in challenging scenarios. In particular, weakly textured scenes and\npoorly constrained configurations oftentimes cause catastrophic failures or\nlarge errors for the primarily keypoint-based pipelines. In these scenarios,\nline segments are often abundant and can offer complementary geometric\nconstraints. Their large spatial extent and typically structured configurations\nlead to stronger geometric constraints as compared to traditional\nkeypoint-based methods. In this work, we introduce an incremental SfM system\nthat, in addition to points, leverages lines and their structured geometric\nrelations. Our technical contributions span the entire pipeline (mapping,\ntriangulation, registration) and we integrate these into a comprehensive\nend-to-end SfM system that we share as an open-source software with the\ncommunity. We also present the first analytical method to propagate\nuncertainties for 3D optimized lines via sensitivity analysis. Experiments show\nthat our system is consistently more robust and accurate compared to the widely\nused point-based state of the art in SfM -- achieving richer maps and more\nprecise camera registrations, especially under challenging conditions.

The new pixel-only tracker (ITS2) consists of 7 layers of Monolithic\nActive Pixel Sensors (MAPS) featuring a pixel size of 27x29 $\\mu$m$^2$, with an\nintrinsic spatial resolution of 5 $\\mu$m. With 24120 sensors and 12.5 billion\npixels, this detector covers an active area of about 10 m$^2$ and represents\nthe largest application of the MAPS technology in a high-energy physics\nexperiment to date. The most significant improvements introduced by the ITS2 to\nthe ALICE experiment include a reduction in the impact parameter resolution to\napproximately 30 $\\mu$m in both the r$\\varphi$ and z coordinates at a\ntransverse momentum of 1 GeV/c. This is a factor of 3 improvement over the\nprevious detector. Additionally, the standard ITS readout rate has been\nincreased from 1 kHz to 67 kHz in Pb-Pb collisions and to 202 kHz in\nproton-proton collisions. To ensure stable operations and maintain high data\nquality a regular calibration is performed, which consists in establishing the\ncharge threshold and the noisy channels of the detector. The ITS2 has been\nsuccessfully commissioned for LHC Run3, and already operated during\nproton-proton and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC with excellent performance.

This type of generalization, particularly in scenarios\nbeyond training data, is also of great interest in the study of AI safety and\nalignment. A recent study introduced the SKILL-MIX evaluation, where models are\ntasked with composing a short paragraph demonstrating the use of a specified\n$k$-tuple of language skills. While small models struggled with composing even\nwith $k=3$, larger models like GPT-4 performed reasonably well with $k=5$ and\n$6$.\n  In this paper, we employ a setup akin to SKILL-MIX to evaluate the capacity\nof smaller models to learn compositional generalization from examples.\nUtilizing a diverse set of language skills -- including rhetorical, literary,\nreasoning, theory of mind, and common sense -- GPT-4 was used to generate text\nsamples that exhibit random subsets of $k$ skills. Subsequent fine-tuning of 7B\nand 13B parameter models on these combined skill texts, for increasing values\nof $k$, revealed the following findings: (1) Training on combinations of $k=2$\nand $3$ skills results in noticeable improvements in the ability to compose\ntexts with $k=4$ and $5$ skills, despite models never having seen such examples\nduring training. (2) When skill categories are split into training and held-out\ngroups, models significantly improve at composing texts with held-out skills\nduring testing despite having only seen training skills during fine-tuning,\nillustrating the efficacy of the training approach even with previously unseen\nskills. This study also suggests that incorporating skill-rich (potentially\nsynthetic) text into training can substantially enhance the compositional\ncapabilities of models.",

We limit ourselves to the\nsimplified case of a massless viscous thin accretion disk under the influence\nof the gravitational potential from a binary system whose orbital plane is\ninclined relative to the disk. The orbital plane could be inclined if it is not\ncoeval with the disk, or the black holes have spin angular momentum misaligned\nwith respect to the disk's orbital angular momentum, so that the binary can\nprecess to an inclined orientation.

We\ninvestigate their impact on the density and torque distribution. In our\nanalytical approach, we consider the stability of epicycles induced by the\nperturbative effect of the asymmetric inclined binary gravitational potential\non Keplerian circular orbits.

    "abstract": "In Minkowski spacetime quantum field theory, each stationary motion is\nassociated with an effective, energy-dependent notion of temperature, which\ngeneralises the familiar Unruh temperature of uniform linear acceleration.\nMotivated by current experimental interest in circular motion, we analyse the\neffective temperature for drifted Rindler motion, generated by a boost and a\nspacelike translation (drift), and the way in which drifted Rindler motion can\nbe smoothly (and in fact real analytically) deformed to circular motion through\na third type of motion known as parator. For an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled\nlinearly to a massless scalar field in 2+1 and 3+1 spacetime dimensions, we\nestablish analytic results in the limits of large gap, small gap and large\ndrift speed. For fixed proper acceleration, the drifted Rindler temperature\nremains bounded in the large gap limit, in contrast to the circular motion\ntemperature, which can be arbitrarily large in this limit. Finally, in 2+1\ndimensions, we trace the vanishing of the circular motion temperature in the\nsmall gap limit to the weak decay of the Wightman function, and we show that,\namong all types of stationary motion in all dimensions, this phenomenon is\nunique to 2+1 dimensions and therein to circular and parator motion.",

The\nanalysis is mainly conducted by virtue of probabilistic modeling of cross\nentropy optimization and reasoning with rare event simulation techniques. The\napplication of the law of large numbers [2, 3, 6] and the application of\nmathematical inductions make the analysis of Riemann Hypothesis self-contained\nand complete to make sure that the whole complex plane is covered as\nconjectured in Riemann Hypothesis. We also discuss the method of enhanced top-p\nsampling with large language models (LLMs) for reasoning, where next token\nprediction is not just based on the estimated probabilities of each possible\ntoken in the current round but also based on accumulated path probabilities\namong multiple top-k chain of thoughts (CoTs) paths.

We contend that entropy can\ndrive the reappearance of structural modulations, consistent with predicted\ndynamic structural instabilities in undistorted TaCo2Te2, and further supported\nby Raman measurements. These findings not only reveal unexpected phase\ntransitions in a crystalline material but also present a new pathway for\ncreating novel ordered phases in low-dimensional systems.",

    "abstract": "Guitar Pickups have been in production for nearly 100 years, and the question\nof how exactly one pickup is tonally superior to another is still subject to a\nhigh level of debate. This paper is the first in a set demystifying the\nproduction of guitar pickups and introducing a level of scientific procedure to\nthe conversation. Previous studies have analysed commercial off-the-shelf\npickups, but these differ from each other in multiple ways. The novelty of this\nstudy is that dedicated experimental pickups were created, which vary only one\nparameter at a time in order to allow scientific study. The most fundamental\nqualities of a single-coil pickup are investigated: in this paper, number of\nturns and gauge of wire. A set of single-coil stratocaster-style pickups were\ncreated, with the number of turns of wire varied across the commercially\navailable range (5000-12000 turns), and this was done for two widely used wire\ngauges (42 and 44 AWG). A frequency response analyser was used to obtain\nimpedance across a frequency range. It is shown that resonant frequency\ndecreases exponentially with number of turns, while the magnitude of the\nresonant peak increases linearly with number of turns. The wire gauge used has\na significant impact on both parameters, with the thicker wire giving higher\nresonant frequencies and higher magnitudes than the thinner wire for the same\nnumber of turns. These impact the sound associated with the pickup: the\nresonant frequency is linked to the perceived tone of the pickup, and the\nmagnitude to the output amplitude and hence 'gain.' Increasing the number of\nturns will give a higher output pickup with a darker tone, and thicker wire\ngives louder outputs and brighter tones - consistent with what can be observed\nin commercial pickups.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has delved into advanced designs for reconfigurable\nintelligent surfaces (RIS) with integrated sensing functions. One promising\nconcept is the hybrid RIS (HRIS), which blends sensing and reflecting\nmeta-atoms. This enables HRIS to process signals, aiding in channel estimation\n(CE) and symbol detection tasks. This paper formulates novel semi-blind\nreceivers for HRIS-aided wireless communications that enable joint symbol and\nCE at the HRIS and BS. The proposed receivers exploit a tensor coding at the\ntransmit side, while capitalizing on the multilinear structures of the received\nsignals. We develop iterative and closed-form receiver algorithms for joint\nestimation of the uplink channels and symbols at both the HRIS and the BS,\nenabling joint channel and symbol estimation functionalities. The proposed\nreceivers offer symbol decoding capabilities to the HRIS and ensure\nambiguity-free separate CE without requiring an a priori training stage. We\nalso study identifiability conditions that provide a unique joint channel and\nsymbol recovery, and discuss the computational complexities and tradeoffs\ninvolved in the proposed semi-blind receivers. Our findings demonstrate the\ncompetitive performances of the proposed solutions at the HRIS and the BS and\nunveil distinct performance trends based on the possible combinations of\nHRIS-BS receiver pairs. Finally, extensive numerical results elucidate the\ninterplay between power splitting, symbol recovery, and CE accuracy in\nHRIS-assisted communications. Such insights are pivotal for optimizing receiver\ndesign and enhancing system performance in future HRIS deployments.",

Naively learning the regression function and taking a\nsample mean of the target functional results in biased estimators, and a rich\ndebiasing literature has developed where one additionally learns the so-called\nRiesz representer (RR) of the target estimand (targeted learning, double ML,\nautomatic debiasing etc.). Learning the RR via its derived functional form can\nbe challenging, e.g. due to extreme inverse probability weights or the need to\nlearn conditional density functions. Such challenges have motivated recent\nadvances in automatic debiasing (AD), where the RR is learned directly via\nminimization of a bespoke loss. We propose moment-constrained learning as a new\nRR learning approach that addresses some shortcomings in AD, constraining the\npredicted moments and improving the robustness of RR estimates to optimization\nhyperparamters.

    "abstract": "Galactic outflows provide important feedback effects to regulate the\nevolution of host galaxies. Two primary diagnostics of outflows are broad\nand/or blueshifted emission and absorption lines. Even though well-established\nmethods exist to analyze these outflow signatures, connections between them are\nrarely studied and largely unknown. In this paper, we conduct such a study in a\nsample of 33 low-redshift starburst galaxies. Their UV absorption lines are\ndetected by Hubble Space Telescope, and optical emission lines are observed by\nKeck or Very Large Telescope. We find outflow properties derived from emission\nand absorption lines are tightly correlated. These include outflow maximum\nvelocity, line width, and radial extent. On average, in the same galaxy, the\nmaximum velocity and line width of outflows measured from emission lines reach\nonly 60 -- 70% of those from the absorption lines. We also find outflow rates\nderived from emission lines are consistently lower than those from absorption\nlines by 0.2 -- 0.5 dex. These findings can be explained by a radial decline in\ndensity and a corresponding increase in outflow velocity, combined with the\nfact that emission line luminosity scales with the square of the density while\nabsorption line depth scales linearly. We test both spherical and bi-conical\noutflow models, and find the same radial outflow velocity and density\ndistributions can explain the observed correlations. These results provide\nnovel calibration between galactic outflow properties measured from the two\ndiagnostics and underscore the need for high-fidelity UV and optical spectra to\naccurately assess galactic feedback effects in high-z galaxies.",

Limiting access only to source\ndomain data imposes two key challenges - how to train a model that can\ngeneralize and how to verify that it does. The standard practice of validation\non the training distribution does not accurately reflect the model's\ngeneralization ability, while validation on the test distribution is a\nmalpractice to avoid. In this work, we construct an independent validation set\nby transforming source domain images with a comprehensive list of\naugmentations, covering a broad spectrum of potential distribution shifts in\ntarget domains. We demonstrate a high correlation between validation and test\nperformance for multiple methods and across various datasets.

This\nmotivates a discussion about in which sense the Levi property resembles the\nnotion of order continuous norm from Banach lattice theory.\n  (ii) If $X$ is separable and has normal cone, then the assumption that every\nincreasing order bounded sequence has a supremum implies the Levi property.\nThis generalizes a classical result about Banach lattices, but requires new\nideas since one cannot work with disjoint sequences in the proof.\n  (iii) A version of Dini's theorem for ordered Banach spaces that is more\ngeneral than what is typically stated in the literature.

These forms were influenced by the presence and movement of free\ngas, which shaped their development. Block and vein hydrates mainly formed in\nwater-filled pores, while point and membrane hydrates appeared as coatings\nrelated to gas migration. Shell hydrates formed after gas relocation, filling\npores. During dissociation, the presence of free gas accelerated the process\nsignificantly, with a dissociation rate approximately 12 times faster than with\nwater alone. Gas migration was key in accelerating hydrate breakdown and\nfragment formation.

Using high quality human data has been the most common approach to\nunlock model performance, but is prohibitively expensive in many scenarios.\nSeveral alternative methods have also emerged, such as generating synthetic or\nhybrid data, but the effectiveness of these approaches remain unclear,\nespecially in resource-constrained scenarios and tasks that are not easily\nverified. To investigate this, we group various synthetic data generation\nstrategies into three representative categories -- Answer Augmentation,\nQuestion Rephrase and New Question -- and study the performance of student LLMs\ntrained under various constraints, namely seed instruction set size and query\nbudget. We demonstrate that these strategies are not equally effective across\nsettings. Notably, the optimal data generation strategy depends strongly on the\nratio between the available teacher query budget and the size of the seed\ninstruction set. When this ratio is low, generating new answers to existing\nquestions proves most effective, but as this ratio increases, generating new\nquestions becomes optimal. Across all tasks, we find that choice of\naugmentation method and other design choices matter substantially more in low\nto mid data regimes than in high data regimes. We provide a practical framework\nfor selecting the appropriate augmentation method across settings, taking into\naccount additional factors such as the scalability of each method, the\nimportance of verifying synthetic data, and the use of different LLMs for\nsynthetic data generation.",

This study comprehensively evaluates three widely-used strategies for\nhandling class imbalance: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE),\nClass Weights tuning, and Decision Threshold Calibration. We compare these\nmethods against a baseline scenario of no-intervention across 15 diverse\nmachine learning models and 30 datasets from various domains, conducting a\ntotal of 9,000 experiments. Performance was primarily assessed using the\nF1-score, although our study also tracked results on additional 9 metrics\nincluding F2-score, precision, recall, Brier-score, PR-AUC, and AUC. Our\nresults indicate that all three strategies generally outperform the baseline,\nwith Decision Threshold Calibration emerging as the most consistently effective\ntechnique.

However, the use of large\nPLMs significantly increases inference costs, making them less practical for\nsituations requiring low inference times. Furthermore, it is crucial to\nsimultaneously model the relationships between topics and words as well as the\ninterrelationships among topics themselves. In this work, we propose a novel\nframework called NeuroMax (Neural Topic Model with Maximizing Mutual\nInformation with Pretrained Language Model and Group Topic Regularization) to\naddress these challenges. NeuroMax maximizes the mutual information between the\ntopic representation obtained from the encoder in neural topic models and the\nrepresentation derived from the PLM.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) have introduced a new paradigm for web search. However, the limited\ncontext awareness of LLMs degrades their performance on RAG tasks. Existing\nmethods to enhance context awareness are often inefficient, incurring time or\nmemory overhead during inference, and many are tailored to specific position\nembeddings. In this paper, we propose Position-Embedding-Agnostic attention\nRe-weighting (PEAR), which enhances the context awareness of LLMs with zero\ninference overhead. Specifically, on a proxy task focused on context copying,\nwe first detect heads which suppress the models' context awareness thereby\ndiminishing RAG performance. To weaken the impact of these heads, we re-weight\ntheir outputs with learnable coefficients. The LLM (with frozen parameters) is\noptimized by adjusting these coefficients to minimize loss on the proxy task.\nAs a result, the coefficients are optimized to values less than one, thereby\nreducing their tendency to suppress RAG performance. During inference, the\noptimized coefficients are fixed to re-weight these heads, regardless of the\nspecific task at hand. Our proposed PEAR offers two major advantages over\nprevious approaches: (1) It introduces zero additional inference overhead in\nterms of memory usage or inference time, while outperforming competitive\nbaselines in accuracy and efficiency across various RAG tasks. (2) It is\nindependent of position embedding algorithms, ensuring broader applicability.",

This design preserves the pristine top facet of the\nnanowires, making it highly compatible with scanning tunneling spectroscopy.\nUsing this architecture we demonstrate that the mechanical contact supports\nCooper-pair transparency as high as 90\\%, comparable with epitaxial interfaces.\nThe anisotropic angular response to an applied magnetic field shows the\nquasi-two-dimensional nature of the parent superconductivity in the Indium film\nand the quasi-one-dimensional nature of the induced superconductivity in the\nnanowires. Our platform offers robust and advantageous foundations for studying\nthe emergence of topological superconductivity and the interplay of\nsuperconductivity and magnetism using atomic-scale spectroscopic tools.",

    "abstract": "OCR errors are common in digitised historical archives significantly\naffecting their usability and value. Generative Language Models (LMs) have\nshown potential for correcting these errors using the context provided by the\ncorrupted text and the broader socio-cultural context, a process called Context\nLeveraging OCR Correction (CLOCR-C). However, getting sufficient training data\nfor fine-tuning such models can prove challenging. This paper shows that\nfine-tuning a language model on synthetic data using an LM and using a\ncharacter level Markov corruption process can significantly improve the ability\nto correct OCR errors. Models trained on synthetic data reduce the character\nerror rate by 55% and word error rate by 32% over the base LM and outperform\nmodels trained on real data. Key findings include; training on under-corrupted\ndata is better than over-corrupted data; non-uniform character level corruption\nis better than uniform corruption; More tokens-per-observation outperforms more\nobservations for a fixed token budget. The outputs for this paper are a set of\n8 heuristics for training effective CLOCR-C models, a dataset of 11,000\nsynthetic 19th century newspaper articles and scrambledtext a python library\nfor creating synthetic corrupted data.",

Our investigation into approximate MU starts with\nidentifying the steepest descent direction, minimizing the output\nKullback-Leibler divergence to exact MU inside a parameters' neighborhood. This\nprobed direction decomposes into three components: weighted forgetting gradient\nascent, fine-tuning retaining gradient descent, and a weight saliency matrix.\nSuch decomposition derived from Euclidean metric encompasses most existing\ngradient-based MU methods. Nevertheless, adhering to Euclidean space may result\nin sub-optimal iterative trajectories due to the overlooked geometric structure\nof the output probability space. We suggest embedding the unlearning update\ninto a manifold rendered by the remaining geometry, incorporating second-order\nHessian from the remaining data. It helps prevent effective unlearning from\ninterfering with the retained performance. However, computing the second-order\nHessian for large-scale models is intractable. To efficiently leverage the\nbenefits of Hessian modulation, we propose a fast-slow parameter update\nstrategy to implicitly approximate the up-to-date salient unlearning direction.\nFree from specific modal constraints, our approach is adaptable across computer\nvision unlearning tasks, including classification and generation.

    "abstract": "The principal distinction in transitioning from far-field multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) systems to near-field MIMO configurations lies in the\nnotable augmentation of spatial degrees of freedom (DoF).

    "abstract": "The expensive fine-grained annotation and data scarcity have become the\nprimary obstacles for the widespread adoption of deep learning-based Whole\nSlide Images (WSI) classification algorithms in clinical practice. Unlike\nfew-shot learning methods in natural images that can leverage the labels of\neach image, existing few-shot WSI classification methods only utilize a small\nnumber of fine-grained labels or weakly supervised slide labels for training in\norder to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation. They lack sufficient mining\nof available WSIs, severely limiting WSI classification performance. To address\nthe above issues, we propose a novel and efficient dual-tier few-shot learning\nparadigm for WSI classification, named FAST. FAST consists of a dual-level\nannotation strategy and a dual-branch classification framework. Firstly, to\navoid expensive fine-grained annotation, we collect a very small number of WSIs\nat the slide level, and annotate an extremely small number of patches. Then, to\nfully mining the available WSIs, we use all the patches and available patch\nlabels to build a cache branch, which utilizes the labeled patches to learn the\nlabels of unlabeled patches and through knowledge retrieval for patch\nclassification. In addition to the cache branch, we also construct a prior\nbranch that includes learnable prompt vectors, using the text encoder of\nvisual-language models for patch classification. Finally, we integrate the\nresults from both branches to achieve WSI classification. Extensive experiments\non binary and multi-class datasets demonstrate that our proposed method\nsignificantly surpasses existing few-shot classification methods and approaches\nthe accuracy of fully supervised methods with only 0.22$\\%$ annotation costs.\nAll codes and models will be publicly available on\nhttps://github.com/fukexue/FAST.",

    "abstract": "Pumpkin is a vital crop cultivated globally, and its productivity is crucial\nfor food security, especially in developing regions. Accurate and timely\ndetection of pumpkin leaf diseases is essential to mitigate significant losses\nin yield and quality. Traditional methods of disease identification rely\nheavily on subjective judgment by farmers or experts, which can lead to\ninefficiencies and missed opportunities for intervention. Recent advancements\nin machine learning and deep learning offer promising solutions for automating\nand improving the accuracy of plant disease detection. This paper presents a\ncomprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nmodels for classifying diseases in pumpkin plant leaves. Using a publicly\navailable dataset of 2000 highresolution images, we evaluate the performance of\nseveral CNN architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet, in\nrecognizing five classes: healthy leaves and four common diseases downy mildew,\npowdery mildew, mosaic disease, and bacterial leaf spot. We fine-tuned these\npretrained models and conducted hyperparameter optimization experiments.\nResNet-34, DenseNet-121, and EfficientNet-B7 were identified as top-performing\nmodels, each excelling in different classes of leaf diseases. Our analysis\nrevealed DenseNet-121 as the optimal model when considering both accuracy and\ncomputational complexity achieving an overall accuracy of 86%.

    "abstract": "Traditionally, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are classified as long and short GRBs,\nwith $T_{90} = 2$ s being the threshold duration. Generally, long-duration GRBs\n(LGRBs, $T_{90}>2$ s) are associated with the collapse of massive stars, and\nshort-duration (SGRBs, $T_{90}<2$ s) are associated with the compact binary\nmergers involving at least one neutron star. However, the existence of a\npopulation of so-called ``peculiar GRBs\", i.e., LGRBs originating from mergers,\nor long Type I GRBs, and SGRBs originating from collapsars, or short Type II\nGRBs, have challenged the traditional paradigm of GRB classification. Finding\nmore peculiar GRBs may help to give us more insight into this issue. In this\nwork, we analyze the properties of machine learning identified long Type I GRBs\nand short Type II GRBs candidates, long GRBs-I and short GRBs-II (the so-called\n``peculiar GRBs\"). We find that long GRBs-I almost always exhibit properties\nsimilar to Type I, which suggests that the merger may indeed produce GRBs with\n$T_{90}>2$ s. Furthermore, according to the probability given by the redshift\ndistribution, short GRBs-II almost exhibit properties similar to Type II. This\nsuggests that the populations of short Type II GRBs are not scarce and that\nthey are hidden in a large number of samples without redshifts, which is\nunfavorable to the interpretation that the jet progression leads to a missed\nmain emission.",

To\naddress these challenges, we propose a set of nonparametric mean-covariance\nregression models for high-dimensional neural activity with restricted inputs.\nThese models reduce the dimensionality of neural responses by employing a\nlower-dimensional latent factor model, where both factor loadings and latent\nfactors are predictor-dependent, to jointly model mean and covariance across\ncovariates. The smoothness of neural activity across experimental conditions is\nmodeled nonparametrically using two Gaussian processes (GPs), applied to both\nloading basis and latent factors. Additionally, to account for the covariates\nlying in restricted subspace, we incorporate graph information into the\ncovariance structure. To flexibly infer the model, we use an MCMC algorithm to\nsample from posterior distributions. After validating and studying the\nproperties of proposed methods by simulations, we apply them to two neural\ndatasets (local field potential and neural spiking data) to demonstrate the\nusage of models for continuous and counting observations. Overall, the proposed\nmethods provide a framework to jointly model covariate-dependent mean and\ncovariance in high dimensional neural data, especially when the covariates lie\nin restricted domains.

In\norder to meet the challenges, measurements within the distribution grid often\nform the basis for DSOs. Hence, it is an urgent problem that measurement\ndevices are not installed in many low-voltage (LV) grids. In order to overcome\nthis problem, we present an approach to estimate pseudo-measurements for\nnon-measured LV feeders based on the metadata of the respective feeder using\nregression models. The feeder metadata comprise information about the number of\ngrid connection points, the installed power of consumers and producers, and\nbilling data in the downstream LV grid. Additionally, we use weather data,\ncalendar data and timestamp information as model features. The existing\nmeasurements are used as model target. We extensively evaluate the estimated\npseudo-measurements on a large real-world dataset with 2,323 LV feeders\ncharacterized by both consumption and feed-in. For this purpose, we introduce\npeak metrics inspired by the BigDEAL challenge for the peak magnitude, timing\nand shape for both consumption and feed-in. As regression models, we use\nXGBoost, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a linear regression (LR). We observe\nthat XGBoost and MLP outperform the LR. Furthermore, the results show that the\napproach adapts to different weather, calendar and timestamp conditions and\nproduces realistic load curves based on the feeder metadata.

    "abstract": "An insurance company, as a risk bearer, is exposed to the likelihood of\nrunning into ruin. This is the situation where the initial surplus falls below\nzero. There is the need to find the required start-up capital to hedge against\ninsolvency. Most researchers, irrespective of whether the test for claim\ndependency holds or not, assume claim independence in their computing of ruin\nprobabilities to start up their initial capital. The objective of this study is\nto carry out comparative sensitivity analysis of ruin probability under both\nassumptions of dependence and independence, irrespective of whether the data\nexhibits independence or not, based on data from an insurance company in Ghana.\nSecondary data from an insurance company was obtained from the National\nInsurance Commission (NIC) for the period of 2013 to 2017. The study employed\ncopulas to determine the claim dependence among the various insurance products\nand the company in general. The study concluded that when there is dependence\nin the claim data, computing the ruin probability based on the assumption of\nindependence results in underestimation. Among the various insurance products,\nthe most profitable insurance product was motor insurance, and Fire and Allied\ninsurance exhibited the highest dependency. At a higher start-up capital, when\nclaims are dependent, assuming independence in calculating the ruin probability\nresults in a significant difference. Hence, it was recommended that insurance\ncompanies should adopt the assumption of dependence between the claims data as\nthe initial reserves become larger, particularly for larger insurance\ncompanies, to avoid misleading results. Also, awareness of the perils and\nconsequences of fire outbreaks and disasters should be raised to the general\npublic to reduce the risk of frequent occurrence.",

To\nevaluate the empirical robustness and certified robustness of our watermark\nalgorithm, we conducted comprehensive experiments.

Empowering large language models (LLMs) to reason over\ntabular data represents an actively explored direction. However, since typical\nLLMs only support one-dimensional~(1D) inputs, existing methods often flatten\nthe two-dimensional~(2D) table structure into a sequence of tokens, which can\nseverely disrupt the spatial relationships and result in an inevitable loss of\nvital contextual information. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate\nthe detrimental impact of such flattening operations on the performance of LLMs\nin capturing the spatial information of tables through two elaborate proxy\ntasks. Subsequently, we introduce a simple yet effective positional encoding\nmethod, termed ``2D-TPE'' (Two-Dimensional Table Positional Encoding), to\naddress this challenge. 2D-TPE enables each attention head to dynamically\nselect a permutation order of tokens within the context for attending to them,\nwhere each permutation represents a distinct traversal mode for the table, such\nas column-wise or row-wise traversal. 2D-TPE effectively mitigates the risk of\nlosing essential spatial information while preserving computational efficiency,\nthus better preserving the table structure. Extensive experiments across five\nbenchmarks demonstrate that 2D-TPE outperforms strong baselines, underscoring\nthe importance of preserving the table structure for accurate table\ncomprehension. Comprehensive analysis further reveals the substantially better\nscalability of 2D-TPE to large tables than baselines.",

Additionally, a further limitation of present-day copper RFQs is\nsurface blistering under hydrogen ion beam exposure, due to beam halo losses.\nIrradiation is associated with a further reduction of the breakdown field\nstrength of the metal surface thereby affecting the overall efficiency of the\nRFQ. The investigated materials, Cu-OFE, CuCr1Zr, CuBe2, Ti6Al4V, SS316LN, Nb\nand Ta, were submitted to low-energy (45 keV) H$^-$ irradiation and tested in a\ndirect-current (DC) system with pulsed high voltage.

Blistering caused by H$^-$ irradiation has been observed in all\ncopper and copper alloy materials.

    "abstract": "In the first-quantized description of bosonic systems permutation cycles\nformed by the particles play a fundamental role. In the ideal Bose gas\nBose-Enstein condensation (BEC) is signaled by the appearance of infinite\ncycles. When the particles interact, the two phenomena may not be simultaneous,\nthe existence of infinite cycles is necessary but not sufficient for BEC. We\ndemonstrate that their appearance is always accompanied by a singularity in the\nthermodynamic quantities which in three and four dimensions can be as strong as\na one-sided divergence of the isothermal compressibility. Arguments are\npresented that long-range interactions can give rise to unexpected results,\nsuch as the absence of infinite cycles in three dimensions for long-range\nrepulsion or their presence in one and two dimensions if the pair potential has\na long attractive tail.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To develop the Ultimate Phantom Dog for Orthovoltage Glioma\nTreatment (UPDOG), an anatomically-correct phantom which mimics a dog's head,\nfor quality assurance (QA) of kilovoltage (kV) radiotherapy treatments.\n  Methods: A computed tomography (CT) scan of a canine glioma patient was\nsegmented into bone and soft tissue using 3DSlicer. The segments were converted\nto stereolithographic (STL) files and smoothed in Fusion360. A slit to\naccommodate a radiochromic film (RCF) was added at the location of the glioma\ntumor. UPDOG was 3D printed on a polyjet printer using VeroUltraWhite ($\\rho$ =\n1.19-1.20 g/cm\\textsuperscript{3}) for the bone and Agilus30 ($\\rho$ =\n1.14-1.15 g/cm\\textsuperscript{3}) for the soft tissue. CT scans of UPDOG were\nacquired on a clinical CT scanner. An LD-V1 RCF was inserted into UPDOG and\nirradiated with a kV x-ray source from two angles. The delivered dose to the\nRCF was compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations performed in TOPAS.\n  Results: The bone and soft tissue segments in UPDOG were mimicked the patient\nanatomy well with tube voltage-dependent CT numbers. The contrast in HU was of\n49, 47 and 50 HU for the 80, 100, and 120 kVp scans, respectively, sufficient\nfor anatomy visualization. The irradiations delivered a maximum dose to RCF of\n284 mGy which was compared to the results of MC simulations using a depth dose\ncurve and central-axis (CAX) beam profiles. The mean difference in CAX profiles\nand PDD between RCF and MC results was 15.9\\% and 2.3\\%, respectively.\n  Conclusions: We have demonstrated that UPDOG is a useful QA tool for kV\ncanine radiotherapy. UPDOG successfully anatomically mimicked the dog anatomy,\nwith a reduced but sufficient bone contrast. We showed that dose delivered to a\ncanine glioma with kV x-rays can be successfully measured with an RCF\npositioned at the tumor location.",

    "abstract": "Text-driven human motion generation is a multimodal task that synthesizes\nhuman motion sequences conditioned on natural language. It requires the model\nto satisfy textual descriptions under varying conditional inputs, while\ngenerating plausible and realistic human actions with high diversity. Existing\ndiffusion model-based approaches have outstanding performance in the diversity\nand multimodality of generation. However, compared to autoregressive methods\nthat train motion encoders before inference, diffusion methods lack in fitting\nthe distribution of human motion features which leads to an unsatisfactory FID\nscore. One insight is that the diffusion model lack the ability to learn the\nmotion relations among spatio-temporal semantics through contextual reasoning.\nTo solve this issue, in this paper, we proposed Motion Masked Diffusion Model\n\\textbf{(MMDM)}, a novel human motion masked mechanism for diffusion model to\nexplicitly enhance its ability to learn the spatio-temporal relationships from\ncontextual joints among motion sequences. Besides, considering the complexity\nof human motion data with dynamic temporal characteristics and spatial\nstructure, we designed two mask modeling strategies: \\textbf{time frames mask}\nand \\textbf{body parts mask}. During training, MMDM masks certain tokens in the\nmotion embedding space. Then, the diffusion decoder is designed to learn the\nwhole motion sequence from masked embedding in each sampling step, this allows\nthe model to recover a complete sequence from incomplete representations.\nExperiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML dataset demonstrate that our mask strategy\nis effective by balancing motion quality and text-motion consistency.",

Recent research LIMA\ndemonstrates that alignment is essentially a process where the model adapts\ninstructions' interaction style or format to solve various tasks, leveraging\npre-trained knowledge and skills. Therefore, for instructional data, the most\nimportant aspect is the task it represents, rather than the specific semantics\nand knowledge information. The latent representations of instructions play\nroles for some instruction-related tasks like data selection and demonstrations\nretrieval. However, they are always derived from text embeddings, encompass\noverall semantic information that influences the representation of task\ncategories. In this work, we introduce a new concept, instruction embedding,\nand construct Instruction Embedding Benchmark (IEB) for its training and\nevaluation. Then, we propose a baseline Prompt-based Instruction Embedding\n(PIE) method to make the representations more attention on tasks. The\nevaluation of PIE, alongside other embedding methods on IEB with two designed\ntasks, demonstrates its superior performance in accurately identifying task\ncategories. Moreover, the application of instruction embeddings in four\ndownstream tasks showcases its effectiveness and suitability for\ninstruction-related tasks.",

Existing methods are mostly tailored for specific weather types and\nrely heavily on extensive labeled data. In dealing with these two limitations,\nthis paper presents a pioneering semi-supervised all-in-one adverse weather\nremoval framework built on the teacher-student network with a Denoising\nDiffusion Model (DDM) as the backbone, termed SemiDDM-Weather.

This gap has spurred the\ndevelopment of various parameter estimation algorithms, particularly within the\nrealm of Simulation-Based Inference (SBI), such as neural and statistical SBI\nmethods. Limited research exists on how to make informed choices on SBI methods\nwhen faced with real-world data, which often results in some form of model\nmisspecification. In this paper, we provide comprehensive guidelines for\ndeciding between SBI approaches for complex biological models. We apply the\nguidelines to two agent-based models that describe cellular dynamics using\nreal-world data. Our study unveils a critical insight: while neural SBI methods\ndemand significantly fewer simulations for inference results, they tend to\nyield biased estimations, a trend persistent even with robust variants of these\nalgorithms. On the other hand, the accuracy of statistical SBI methods enhances\nsubstantially as the number of simulations increases. This finding suggests\nthat, given a sufficient computational budget, statistical SBI can surpass\nneural SBI in performance.

However, we argue that this formulation does not adequately\nconvey the complete reading order information in the layout, which may\npotentially lead to performance decline in downstream VrD tasks. To address\nthis issue, we propose to model the layout reading order as ordering relations\nover the set of layout elements, which have sufficient expressive capability\nfor the complete reading order information. To enable empirical evaluation on\nmethods towards the improved form of reading order prediction (ROP), we\nestablish a comprehensive benchmark dataset including the reading order\nannotation as relations over layout elements, together with a\nrelation-extraction-based method that outperforms previous methods. Moreover,\nto highlight the practical benefits of introducing the improved form of layout\nreading order, we propose a reading-order-relation-enhancing pipeline to\nimprove model performance on any arbitrary VrD task by introducing additional\nreading order relation inputs. Comprehensive results demonstrate that the\npipeline generally benefits downstream VrD tasks: (1) with utilizing the\nreading order relation information, the enhanced downstream models achieve SOTA\nresults on both two task settings of the targeted dataset; (2) with utilizing\nthe pseudo reading order information generated by the proposed ROP model, the\nperformance of the enhanced models has improved across all three models and\neight cross-domain VrD-IE/QA task settings without targeted optimization.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient technique for updating the\nknowledge of large language models (LLMs), attracting increasing attention in\nrecent years. However, there is a lack of effective measures to prevent the\nmalicious misuse of this technique, which could lead to harmful edits in LLMs.\nThese malicious modifications could cause LLMs to generate toxic content,\nmisleading users into inappropriate actions. In front of this risk, we\nintroduce a new task, $\\textbf{K}$nowledge $\\textbf{E}$diting $\\textbf{T}$ype\n$\\textbf{I}$dentification (KETI), aimed at identifying different types of edits\nin LLMs, thereby providing timely alerts to users when encountering illicit\nedits. As part of this task, we propose KETIBench, which includes five types of\nharmful edits covering the most popular toxic types, as well as one benign\nfactual edit. We develop five classical classification models and three\nBERT-based models as baseline identifiers for both open-source and\nclosed-source LLMs. Our experimental results, across 92 trials involving four\nmodels and three knowledge editing methods, demonstrate that all eight baseline\nidentifiers achieve decent identification performance, highlighting the\nfeasibility of identifying malicious edits in LLMs. Additional analyses reveal\nthat the performance of the identifiers is independent of the reliability of\nthe knowledge editing methods and exhibits cross-domain generalization,\nenabling the identification of edits from unknown sources.

We start our investigation by first considering an untwisted\nbilayer system with an arbitrary relative shift between layers; a symmetry\nanalysis for this case permits us to obtain a simplified effective low-energy\nHamiltonian valid near the important $\\mathbf{K}$ valley region of the\nBrillouin zone. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) was then employed to\nobtain relaxed geometric structures for pressures within the range of 0.0 - 3.5\nGPa and corresponding band structures. The DFT data were then fitted to the\nlow-energy Hamiltonian to obtain a pressure-dependent Hamiltonian. We then\napply our model to a twisted system by treating the twist as a\nposition-dependent shift between layers - here, we assume rigid layers, which\nis a crucial simplification. In summary, this approach allowed us to obtain the\nexplicit analytical expressions for a Hamiltonian that describes a twisted\nMoTe\\textsubscript{2} bilayer under pressure. Our Hamiltonian then permitted us\nto study the impact of pressure on the band topology of the twisted system. As\na result, we identified many pressure-induced topological phase transitions as\nindicated by changes in valley Chern numbers. Moreover, we found that pressure\ncould be employed to flatten bands in some of the cases we considered.",

    "abstract": "Image coding for multi-task applications, catering to both human perception\nand machine vision, has been extensively investigated. Existing methods often\nrely on multiple task-specific encoder-decoder pairs, leading to high overhead\nof parameter and bitrate usage, or face challenges in multi-objective\noptimization under a unified representation, failing to achieve both\nperformance and efficiency. To this end, we propose Multi-Path Aggregation\n(MPA) integrated into existing coding models for joint human-machine vision,\nunifying the feature representation with an all-in-one architecture. MPA\nemploys a predictor to allocate latent features among task-specific paths based\non feature importance varied across tasks, maximizing the utility of shared\nfeatures while preserving task-specific features for subsequent refinement.\nLeveraging feature correlations, we develop a two-stage optimization strategy\nto alleviate multi-task performance degradation. Upon the reuse of shared\nfeatures, as low as 1.89% parameters are further augmented and fine-tuned for a\nspecific task, which completely avoids extensive optimization of the entire\nmodel. Experimental results show that MPA achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art methods in both task-specific and multi-objective optimization\nacross human viewing and machine analysis tasks.

    "abstract": "Deformable medical image registration is a crucial aspect of medical image\nanalysis. In recent years, researchers have begun leveraging auxiliary tasks\n(such as supervised segmentation) to provide anatomical structure information\nfor the primary registration task, addressing complex deformation challenges in\nmedical image registration. In this work, we propose a multi-task learning\nframework based on multi-scale dual attention frequency fusion (DAFF-Net),\nwhich simultaneously achieves the segmentation masks and dense deformation\nfields in a single-step estimation. DAFF-Net consists of a global encoder, a\nsegmentation decoder, and a coarse-to-fine pyramid registration decoder. During\nthe registration decoding process, we design the dual attention frequency\nfeature fusion (DAFF) module to fuse registration and segmentation features at\ndifferent scales, fully leveraging the correlation between the two tasks. The\nDAFF module optimizes the features through global and local weighting\nmechanisms. During local weighting, it incorporates both high-frequency and\nlow-frequency information to further capture the features that are critical for\nthe registration task. With the aid of segmentation, the registration learns\nmore precise anatomical structure information, thereby enhancing the anatomical\nconsistency of the warped images after registration. Additionally, due to the\nDAFF module's outstanding ability to extract effective feature information, we\nextend its application to unsupervised registration. Extensive experiments on\nthree public 3D brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets demonstrate\nthat the proposed DAFF-Net and its unsupervised variant outperform\nstate-of-the-art registration methods across several evaluation metrics,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in deformable medical image\nregistration.",

When the thickness of the concentration\nboundary layer is less than about one-sixth of the pore spacing, the flow\nfinally enters the RB regime. In the Darcy regime, the scaling exponent of $Sh$\nand $Ra_D$ decreases as porosity increases. Based on the Grossman-Lohse theory\n(J. Fluid Mech., vol. 407, 2000; Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 86, 2001), we provide\nan explanation for the scaling laws in each regime and highlight the\nsignificant impact of mechanical dispersion effects within the boundary layer.\nOur findings provide some new insights into the validity range of the Darcy\nmodel.",

    "abstract": "The open-ended coaxial probe (OECP) technique is one of the most commonly\nused methods for the characterization of homogeneous media properties,\nespecially in the biomedical sciences. However, when considering inhomogeneous\nmedia, the effect of the heterogeneity on the probe terminal admittance is\nunclear, making the measured admittance hard to interpret and relate to the\nmedium properties. In this paper we present an analytical model for the\ncontribution of an isotropic scatterer embedded in an otherwise homogeneous\nmedium to the probe admittance. We utilize rigorous scattering theory and\nvarious approximations to obtain simplified, closed-form expressions. Using the\nobtained results we present a method to accurately extract the scatterer\nproperties from a measurement of the admittance. In addition, we define the\nsensing depth, and show how it can be mapped as a function of the expected\nscatterer properties. Full-wave simulations are used to verify the analytical\nmodel, and the proposed method paves a path for further generalization to\nadditional scenarios of open-coaxial probe sensing of an inhomogeneous medium.",

Most existing approaches achieve this by mapping\nsemantics to 3D instances based on static geometric structure and visual\nappearance. This passive strategy limits the agent's ability to actively\nperceive and engage with the environment, making it reliant on predefined\nsemantic instructions. In contrast, humans develop complex interaction skills\nby observing and imitating how others interact with their surroundings. To\nempower the model with such abilities, we introduce a novel task: grounding 3D\nscene affordance from egocentric interactions, where the goal is to identify\nthe corresponding affordance regions in a 3D scene based on an egocentric video\nof an interaction. This task faces the challenges of spatial complexity and\nalignment complexity across multiple sources. To address these challenges, we\npropose the Egocentric Interaction-driven 3D Scene Affordance Grounding\n(Ego-SAG) framework, which utilizes interaction intent to guide the model in\nfocusing on interaction-relevant sub-regions and aligns affordance features\nfrom different sources through a bidirectional query decoder mechanism.\nFurthermore, we introduce the Egocentric Video-3D Scene Affordance Dataset\n(VSAD), covering a wide range of common interaction types and diverse 3D\nenvironments to support this task.

    "abstract": "Oriented object detection in remote sensing images is a challenging task due\nto objects being distributed in multi-orientation. Recently, end-to-end\ntransformer-based methods have achieved success by eliminating the need for\npost-processing operators compared to traditional CNN-based methods. However,\ndirectly extending transformers to oriented object detection presents three\nmain issues: 1) objects rotate arbitrarily, necessitating the encoding of\nangles along with position and size; 2) the geometric relations of oriented\nobjects are lacking in self-attention, due to the absence of interaction\nbetween content and positional queries; and 3) oriented objects cause\nmisalignment, mainly between values and positional queries in cross-attention,\nmaking accurate classification and localization difficult. In this paper, we\npropose an end-to-end transformer-based oriented object detector, consisting of\nthree dedicated modules to address these issues. First, Gaussian positional\nencoding is proposed to encode the angle, position, and size of oriented boxes\nusing Gaussian distributions. Second, Wasserstein self-attention is proposed to\nintroduce geometric relations and facilitate interaction between content and\npositional queries by utilizing Gaussian Wasserstein distance scores. Third,\noriented cross-attention is proposed to align values and positional queries by\nrotating sampling points around the positional query according to their angles.\nExperiments on six datasets DIOR-R, a series of DOTA, HRSC2016 and ICDAR2015\nshow the effectiveness of our approach. Compared with previous end-to-end\ndetectors, the OrientedFormer gains 1.16 and 1.21 AP$_{50}$ on DIOR-R and\nDOTA-v1.0 respectively, while reducing training epochs from 3$\\times$ to\n1$\\times$.

Traditional parameter estimation methods\nface limitations such as reliance on initial guesses, labor-intensive fitting\nprocedures, and complex testing setups. On the other hand, purely data-driven\nmachine learning methods struggle to capture inherent physical constraints and\ntypically require large datasets for optimal performance. To address these\nchallenges, this paper introduces the Fine-Tuning Hybrid Dynamics (FTHD)\nmethod, which integrates supervised and unsupervised Physics-Informed Neural\nNetworks (PINNs), combining physics-based modeling with data-driven techniques.\nFTHD fine-tunes a pre-trained Deep Dynamics Model (DDM) using a smaller\ntraining dataset, delivering superior performance compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods such as the Deep Pacejka Model (DPM) and outperforming the original\nDDM. Furthermore, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is embedded within FTHD\n(EKF-FTHD) to effectively manage noisy real-world data, ensuring accurate\ndenoising while preserving the vehicle's essential physical characteristics.\nThe proposed FTHD framework is validated through scaled simulations using the\nBayesRace Physics-based Simulator and full-scale real-world experiments from\nthe Indy Autonomous Challenge. Results demonstrate that the hybrid approach\nsignificantly improves parameter estimation accuracy, even with reduced data,\nand outperforms existing models.

By using a 2D fluid model, we investigate the\nmicroscopic characteristics of the SF6 streamer channel in highly non-uniform\nfields and uncover a previously unexplained coherent structure: the spatial\nfluctuation of the electric field (SFEF). We validate the physical validity of\nSFEF by modifying model parameters that could potentially introduce\nnon-physical effects. Further comparative analysis reveals that SFEF is driven\nby an ion-conducting channel formed due to the strong electronegativity of SF6.\nThis ion-conducting channel exhibits local characteristics, which fundamentally\narise from the slow response of charged species to local charge relaxation. We\nidentify that some charge separation originates from the accumulation of\nnegative ions at the rear edge of the streamer head due to strong electric\nfield shielding in this region. As the streamer propagates, charge separation\nis continuously generated and passively carried into the streamer channel,\nultimately forming the SFEF. Finally, we confirm that SFEF does not occur in\nuniform fields, indicating that it is a phenomenon exclusive to highly\nnon-uniform fields. These findings provide a deep insight into the electric\nfield within the SF6 streamer channel and offer a potential avenue for further\ninvestigation into the mechanisms of SF6 nonlinear breakdown voltage.",

    "abstract": "Livine and Bonzom recently proposed a geometric formula for a certain set of\ncomplex zeros of the partition function of the Ising model defined on planar\ngraphs. Remarkably, the zeros depend locally on the geometry of an immersion of\nthe graph in the three dimensional Euclidean space (different immersions give\nrise to different zeros). When restricted to the flat case, the weights become\nthe critical weights on circle patterns.\n  We rigorously prove the formula by geometrically constructing a null\neigenvector of the Kac-Ward matrix whose determinant is the squared partition\nfunction. The main ingredient of the proof is the realisation that the\nassociated Kac-Ward transition matrix gives rise to an SU(2) connection on the\ngraph, creating a direct link with rotations in three dimensions. The existence\nof a null eigenvector turns out to be equivalent to this connection being flat.",

    "abstract": "Precise future human motion prediction over sub-second horizons from past\nobservations is crucial for various safety-critical applications. To date, only\na few studies have examined the vulnerability of skeleton-based neural networks\nto evasion and backdoor attacks. In this paper, we propose BadHMP, a novel\nbackdoor attack that targets specifically human motion prediction tasks. Our\napproach involves generating poisoned training samples by embedding a localized\nbackdoor trigger in one limb of the skeleton, causing selected joints to follow\npredefined motion in historical time steps. Subsequently, the future sequences\nare globally modified that all the joints move following the target\ntrajectories. Our carefully designed backdoor triggers and targets guarantee\nthe smoothness and naturalness of the poisoned samples, making them stealthy\nenough to evade detection by the model trainer while keeping the poisoned model\nunobtrusive in terms of prediction fidelity to untainted sequences. The target\nsequences can be successfully activated by the designed input sequences even\nwith a low poisoned sample injection ratio. Experimental results on two\ndatasets (Human3.6M and CMU-Mocap) and two network architectures (LTD and HRI)\ndemonstrate the high-fidelity, effectiveness, and stealthiness of BadHMP.\nRobustness of our attack against fine-tuning defense is also verified.",

By means of a localization technique, our Newton\nmethod can also be used to determine solutions of fixed-point equations that\nare only locally contractive and not uniquely solvable. We apply our algorithm\nto a quasi-variational inequality which arises in thermoforming and which not\nonly involves the obstacle problem as a source of nonsmoothness but also a\nsemilinear PDE containing a nondifferentiable Nemytskii operator.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a Newton method for unconstrained set optimization\nproblems to find its weakly minimal solutions with respect to lower set-less\nordering. The objective function of the problem under consideration is given by\nfinitely many strongly convex twice continuously differentiable vector-valued\nfunctions. At first, with the help of a family of vector optimization problems\nand the Gerstewitz scalarizing function, we identify a necessary optimality\ncondition for weakly minimal solutions of the considered problem. In the\nproposed Newton method, we derive a sequence of iterative points that exhibits\nlocal convergence to a point which satisfies the derived necessary optimality\ncondition for weakly minimal points. To find this sequence of iterates, we\nformulate a family of vector optimization problems with the help of a partition\nset concept. Then, we find a descent direction for this obtained family of\nvector optimization problems to progress from the current iterate to the next\niterate. As the chosen vector optimization problem differed across the\niterates, the proposed Newton method for set optimization problems is not a\nstraight extension of that for vector optimization problems. A step-wise\nalgorithm of the entire process is provided. The well-definedness and\nconvergence of the proposed method are analyzed. To establish the convergence\nof the proposed algorithm under some regularity condition of the stationary\npoints, we derive three key relations: a condition of nonstationarity, the\nboundedness of the norm of Newton direction, and the existence of step length\nthat satisfies the Armijo condition. We obtain the local superlinear\nconvergence of the proposed method under uniform continuity of the Hessian and\nlocal quadratic convergence under Lipschitz continuity of the Hessian.",

    "abstract": "Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) has gained popularity for\nits ability to adapt pretrained models to target domains without accessing\nsource domains, ensuring source data privacy. While SFUDA is well-developed in\nvisual tasks, its application to Time-Series SFUDA (TS-SFUDA) remains limited\ndue to the challenge of transferring crucial temporal dependencies across\ndomains. Although a few researchers begin to explore this area, they rely on\nspecific source domain designs, which are impractical as source data owners\ncannot be expected to follow particular pretraining protocols. To solve this,\nwe propose Temporal Source Recovery (TemSR), a framework that transfers\ntemporal dependencies for effective TS-SFUDA without requiring source-specific\ndesigns. TemSR features a recovery process that leverages masking, recovery,\nand optimization to generate a source-like distribution with recovered source\ntemporal dependencies. To ensure effective recovery, we further design\nsegment-based regularization to restore local dependencies and anchor-based\nrecovery diversity maximization to enhance the diversity of the source-like\ndistribution. The source-like distribution is then adapted to the target domain\nusing traditional UDA techniques. Extensive experiments across multiple TS\ntasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TemSR, even surpassing existing TS-SFUDA\nmethod that requires source domain designs.

    "abstract": "Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction is a critical aspect of Prognostics\nand Health Management (PHM), aimed at predicting the future state of a system\nto enable timely maintenance and prevent unexpected failures. While existing\ndeep learning methods have shown promise, they often struggle to fully leverage\nthe spatial information inherent in complex systems, limiting their\neffectiveness in RUL prediction. To address this challenge, recent research has\nexplored the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model spatial information\nfor more accurate RUL prediction. This paper presents a comprehensive review of\nGNN techniques applied to RUL prediction, summarizing existing methods and\noffering guidance for future research. We first propose a novel taxonomy based\non the stages of adapting GNNs to RUL prediction, systematically categorizing\napproaches into four key stages: graph construction, graph modeling, graph\ninformation processing, and graph readout. By organizing the field in this way,\nwe highlight the unique challenges and considerations at each stage of the GNN\npipeline. Additionally, we conduct a thorough evaluation of various\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN methods, ensuring consistent experimental settings\nfor fair comparisons. This rigorous analysis yields valuable insights into the\nstrengths and weaknesses of different approaches, serving as an experimental\nguide for researchers and practitioners working in this area. Finally, we\nidentify and discuss several promising research directions that could further\nadvance the field, emphasizing the potential for GNNs to revolutionize RUL\nprediction and enhance the effectiveness of PHM strategies.

When the doping concentration of magnetized YIG rods is\nless than one, a chiral edge state (CES) of the topological photonic alloy\nappears in the frequency range of the non-trivial topological gap of the\nmagnetized YIG crystal. In this work, we surprisingly find that by randomly\nmixing the Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC) and magnetized YIG rods in a square\nlattice, the photonic alloy system with appropriate doping concentrations can\npresent CES in special frequency intervals even when both components support\nthe propagation of bulk states. Analyzing the band structure of two components,\nwe noticed a shift between the first trivial bandgap for PEC and the first\ntopological bandgap for magnetized YIG. When calculating the transmission\nspectrum of the photonic alloy, we discovered that the frequency range for the\ntopological gap gradually opens from the lower limit frequency of the bandgap\nfor PEC to the bandgap for the magnetized YIG rods. The topological gap opening\noccurs as the doping concentration of magnetized YIG rods increases, creating\nan effective band alignment effect. Moreover, the topological gap for the\nphotonic alloy is confirmed by calculating the reflection phase winding with\nthe scattering method. Lastly, the gradual appearance of the CES is identified\nby applying Fourier transformation to real-space electromagnetic fields. Our\nwork broadens the possibilities for flexible topological gap engineering in the\nphotonic alloy system.",

Passive DNN intellectual property (IP) protection methods such as\nwatermarking and fingerprinting attempt to prove the ownership upon IP\nviolation, but they are often too late to stop catastrophic damage of IP abuse\nand too feeble against strong adversaries. In this paper, we propose IDEA, an\nInverse Domain Expert Adaptation based proactive DNN IP protection method\nfeaturing active authorization and source traceability. IDEA generalizes active\nauthorization as an inverse problem of domain adaptation. The multi-adaptive\noptimization is solved by a mixture-of-experts model with one real and two fake\nexperts. The real expert re-optimizes the source model to correctly classify\ntest images with a unique model user key steganographically embedded. The fake\nexperts are trained to output random prediction on test images without or with\nincorrect user key embedded by minimizing their mutual information (MI) with\nthe real expert. The MoE model is knowledge distilled into a unified protected\nmodel to avoid leaking the expert model features by maximizing their MI with\nadditional multi-layer attention and contrastive representation loss\noptimization. IDEA not only prevents unauthorized users without the valid key\nto access the functional model, but also enable the model owner to validate the\ndeployed model and trace the source of IP infringement.

Generative models like Denoising Diffusion\nProbabilistic Model (DDPM) and their variants like pDDPM, mDDPM, cDDPM have\nrecently emerged to be powerful alternatives to perform unsupervised anomaly\ndetection in brain MRI scans. These methods leverage frame-level labels of\nhealthy brains to generate healthy tissues in brain MRI scans.

    "abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning has attracted much attention due to its\nhigh sample efficiency and is expected to be applied to real-world robotic\napplications. In the real world, as unobservable disturbances can lead to\nunexpected situations, robot policies should be taken to improve not only\ncontrol performance but also robustness. Adversarial learning is an effective\nway to improve robustness, but excessive adversary would increase the risk of\nmalfunction, and make the control performance too conservative. Therefore, this\nstudy addresses a new adversarial learning framework to make reinforcement\nlearning robust moderately and not conservative too much. To this end, the\nadversarial learning is first rederived with variational inference. In\naddition, \\textit{light robustness}, which allows for maximizing robustness\nwithin an acceptable performance degradation, is utilized as a constraint. As a\nresult, the proposed framework, so-called LiRA, can automatically adjust\nadversary level, balancing robustness and conservativeness. The expected\nbehaviors of LiRA are confirmed in numerical simulations. In addition, LiRA\nsucceeds in learning a force-reactive gait control of a quadrupedal robot only\nwith real-world data collected less than two hours.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in various medical imaging\napplications, such as automated disease diagnosis. However, due to the local\nneighborhood aggregation paradigm in message passing which characterizes these\nmodels, they inherently suffer from two fundamental limitations: first,\nindistinguishable node embeddings due to heterophilic node aggregation (known\nas over-smoothing), and second, impaired message passing due to aggregation\nthrough graph bottlenecks (known as over-squashing). These challenges hinder\nthe model expressiveness and prevent us from using deeper models to capture\nlong-range node dependencies within the graph. Popular solutions in the\nliterature are either too expensive to process large graphs due to high time\ncomplexity or do not generalize across all graph topologies. To address these\nlimitations, we propose DuoGNN, a scalable and generalizable architecture which\nleverages topology to decouple homophilic and heterophilic edges and capture\nboth short-range and long-range interactions. Our three core contributions\nintroduce (i) a topological edge-filtering algorithm which extracts homophilic\ninteractions and enables the model to generalize well for any graph topology,\n(ii) a heterophilic graph condensation technique which extracts heterophilic\ninteractions and ensures scalability, and (iii) a dual homophilic and\nheterophilic aggregation pipeline which prevents over-smoothing and\nover-squashing during the message passing. We benchmark our model on medical\nand non-medical node classification datasets and compare it with its variants,\nshowing consistent improvements across all tasks.

However, there\nstill remain some issues to be addressed, e.g., the harmonics of notes are\nsometimes recognized as false positive notes, and the size of AMT model tends\nto be larger to improve the transcription performance. To address these issues,\nwe propose an improved high-resolution piano transcription model to well\ncapture specific acoustic characteristics of music signals.

A\nrecent advance Mamba can also well capture intra-sequence dependencies, yet the\ncomplexity is only linear. Hence, we aim to devise a cross (attention-like)\nMamba to capture inter-sequence dependencies for FSS. A simple idea is to scan\non support features to selectively compress them into the hidden state, which\nis then used as the initial hidden state to sequentially scan query features.\nNevertheless, it suffers from (1) support forgetting issue: query features will\nalso gradually be compressed when scanning on them, so the support features in\nhidden state keep reducing, and many query pixels cannot fuse sufficient\nsupport features; (2) intra-class gap issue: query FG is essentially more\nsimilar to itself rather than to support FG, i.e., query may prefer not to fuse\nsupport features but their own ones from the hidden state, yet the success of\nFSS relies on the effective use of support information. To tackle them, we\ndesign a hybrid Mamba network (HMNet), including (1) a support recapped Mamba\nto periodically recap the support features when scanning query, so the hidden\nstate can always contain rich support information; (2) a query intercepted\nMamba to forbid the mutual interactions among query pixels, and encourage them\nto fuse more support features from the hidden state.

In the past decade, deep learning (DL) has gained great popularity for\nsolving CT inverse problems.

Mira variables are highly suitable targets\nfor studying this mass-loss process. Aims: We follow up on our earlier finding\nthat a near-to-mid-infrared colour vs. pulsation period diagram shows two\nsequences of Miras that can be distinguished by the third dredge-up (3DUP)\nindicator technetium in those stars. While IR colours are good indicators of\nthe dust mass-loss rate (MLR) from Miras, no corresponding sequences have been\nfound using the gas MLR. However, investigations of the gas MLR have been\nhampered by data limitations. We aim to alleviate these limitations with new\nobservational data. Methods: We present new optical spectra of a well-selected\nsample of Miras. We searched these spectra for absorption lines of Tc and other\n3DUP indicators and combined our findings with gas MLRs and expansion\nvelocities from the literature. Furthermore, we analyse WISE MIR data and\ncompare the broadband SEDs of Miras with and without Tc. Results: We find no\nsystematic difference in gas MLRs between Miras with and without Tc. However,\nthe gas envelopes of Tc-poor Miras appear to have a higher expansion velocity\nthan those of Miras with Tc. Furthermore, our analysis of the IR photometry\nstrongly corroborates the earlier finding that Tc-poor Miras have a higher MIR\nemission than Tc-rich ones, by as much as a factor of two. We model the IR\ncolours with DARWIN and stationary wind models and conclude that Miras with and\nwithout Tc have different dust content or properties. Conclusions: We discuss\nseveral hypotheses of the observations and conclude that the reduction of free\noxygen by 3DUP of carbon and iron-depleted dust grains in Tc-rich stars are the\nmost convincing explanations for our observations.",

Current\nresearch primarily focuses on the Single-Label Backdoor Attack (SBA), wherein\nadversaries share a consistent target. However, a critical fact is overlooked:\nadversaries may be non-cooperative, have distinct targets, and operate\nindependently, which exhibits a more practical scenario called Multi-Label\nBackdoor Attack (MBA). Unfortunately, prior works are ineffective in the MBA\nscenario since non-cooperative attackers exclude each other. In this work, we\nconduct an in-depth investigation to uncover the inherent constraints of the\nexclusion: similar backdoor mappings are constructed for different targets,\nresulting in conflicts among backdoor functions. To address this limitation, we\npropose Mirage, the first non-cooperative MBA strategy in FL that allows\nattackers to inject effective and persistent backdoors into the global model\nwithout collusion by constructing in-distribution (ID) backdoor mapping.\nSpecifically, we introduce an adversarial adaptation method to bridge the\nbackdoor features and the target distribution in an ID manner. Additionally, we\nfurther leverage a constrained optimization method to ensure the ID mapping\nsurvives in the global training dynamics.

    "abstract": "Orbital angular momentum (OAM) light beams for high-order harmonic generation\n(HHG) provide an additional degree of freedom to study the light-matter\ninteraction at ultrafast timescales. A more sophisticated configuration is a\nperfect optical vortex (POV) beam, a light beam with a helical wavefront\ncharacterized by a phase singularity at its center and an azimuthal phase\nvariation. POV beams are characterized by a radial profile which is independent\nof the OAM. Here we study the non-perturbative process of gas-phase HHG using a\nlinearly polarized POV beam. We observe that the harmonics are emitted with\nsimilar divergence due the perfectness of the POV-driven harmonics.\nFurthermore, the topological charge upscaling is rigorously followed. We show\nthat a POV beam is more advantageous than that of the Laguerre-Gaussian beam\nfor cases where a large topological charge with a small core size is required.\nOur research establishes a pathway for producing bright structured extreme\nultraviolet (XUV) coherent radiation sources--a pivotal tool with multifaceted\napplications across various technological domains.",

Robotic scrub nurses have emerged as a promising\nsolution to improve efficiency and reduce human error during surgery.

In this work, we introduce a novel robotic scrub nurse\nsystem, RoboNurse-VLA, built on a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model by\nintegrating the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) and the Llama 2 language\nmodel.\n  The proposed RoboNurse-VLA system enables highly precise grasping and\nhandover of surgical instruments in real-time based on voice commands from the\nsurgeon.

In practice, DiT-SR\nleverages an overall U-shaped architecture, and adopts a uniform isotropic\ndesign for all the transformer blocks across different stages. The former\nfacilitates multi-scale hierarchical feature extraction, while the latter\nreallocates the computational resources to critical layers to further enhance\nperformance. Moreover, we thoroughly analyze the limitation of the widely used\nAdaLN, and present a frequency-adaptive time-step conditioning module,\nenhancing the model's capacity to process distinct frequency information at\ndifferent time steps.

Although many algorithms have been developed for minimax problems\nin the Euclidean setting, there are relatively few works studying minimax\nproblems on manifolds. In this paper, we develop a flexible Riemannian\nalternating descent ascent (RADA) algorithmic framework for solving\nnonconvex-linear minimax problems on Riemannian manifolds. Within this\nframework, we propose two easy-to-implement yet efficient algorithms that\nalternately perform one or multiple projected/Riemannian gradient descent steps\nand a proximal gradient ascent step at each iteration.

For\ninstance, WSIs contain multiple types of tissue regions, at least some of which\nmight not be relevant to the diagnosis. We introduce HistoROI, a robust yet\nlightweight deep learning-based classifier to segregate WSI into six broad\ntissue regions -- epithelium, stroma, lymphocytes, adipose, artifacts, and\nmiscellaneous. HistoROI is trained using a novel human-in-the-loop and active\nlearning paradigm that ensures variations in training data for\nlabeling-efficient generalization. HistoROI consistently performs well across\nmultiple organs, despite being trained on only a single dataset, demonstrating\nstrong generalization. Further, we have examined the utility of HistoROI in\nimproving the performance of downstream deep learning-based tasks using the\nCAMELYON breast cancer lymph node and TCGA lung cancer datasets. For the former\ndataset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for\nmetastasis versus normal tissue of a neural network trained using weakly\nsupervised learning increased from 0.88 to 0.92 by filtering the data using\nHistoROI.

Materials and Methods: We constructed DiMB-RE, a comprehensive\ncorpus annotated with 15 entity types (e.g., Nutrient, Microorganism) and 13\nrelation types (e.g., INCREASES, IMPROVES) capturing diet-microbiome\nassociations. We fine-tuned and evaluated state-of-the-art NLP models for named\nentity, trigger, and relation extraction as well as factuality detection using\nDiMB-RE.

Results: DiMB-RE consists of 14,450 entities and 4,206 relationships\nfrom 165 publications (including 30 full-text Results sections). Fine-tuned NLP\nmodels performed reasonably well for named entity recognition (0.800 F1 score),\nwhile end-to-end relation extraction performance was modest (0.445 F1). The use\nof Results section annotations improved relation extraction. The impact of\ntrigger detection was mixed. Generative models showed lower accuracy compared\nto fine-tuned models.

NLP models\nfine-tuned on DiMB-RE exhibit lower performance compared to similar corpora,\nhighlighting the complexity of information extraction in this domain.\nMisclassified entities, missed triggers, and cross-sentence relations are the\nmajor sources of relation extraction errors.

Predicting the Real-time Pressure Signal (RPS) is\ncrucial for OFD services, as it is primarily used to measure the current status\nof pressure on the logistics system. When RPS rises, the pressure increases,\nand the platform needs to quickly take measures to prevent the logistics system\nfrom being overloaded. Usually, the average delivery time for all orders within\na business district is used to represent RPS. Existing research on OFD services\nprimarily focuses on predicting the delivery time of orders, while relatively\nless attention has been given to the study of the RPS. Previous research\ndirectly applies general models such as DeepFM, RNN, and GNN for prediction,\nbut fails to adequately utilize the unique temporal and spatial characteristics\nof OFD services, and faces issues with insufficient sensitivity during sudden\nsevere weather conditions or peak periods. To address these problems, this\npaper proposes a new method based on Spatio-Temporal Transformer and Memory\nNetwork (STTM). Specifically, we use a novel Spatio-Temporal Transformer\nstructure to learn logistics features across temporal and spatial dimensions\nand encode the historical information of a business district and its neighbors,\nthereby learning both temporal and spatial information.

Specifically, Hamster employs coding techniques to significantly\ndecrease communication complexity and addresses coding related security issues.\nConsequently, Hamster achieves a throughput gain that increases linearly with\nthe number of nodes, compared to Sync HotStuff. By adjusting the block size,\nHamster outperforms Sync HotStuff in terms of both throughput and latency.\nMoreover, With minor modifications, Hamster can also function effectively in\nmobile sluggish environments, further reducing its dependency on strict\nsynchrony. We implement Hamster and the experimental results demonstrate its\nperformance advantages.

    "abstract": "Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model excels in traditional\nperson re-identification (ReID) tasks due to its inherent advantage in\ngenerating textual descriptions for pedestrian images. However, applying CLIP\ndirectly to intra-camera supervised person re-identification (ICS ReID)\npresents challenges. ICS ReID requires independent identity labeling within\neach camera, without associations across cameras. This limits the effectiveness\nof text-based enhancements. To address this, we propose a novel framework\ncalled CLIP-based Camera-Agnostic Feature Learning (CCAFL) for ICS ReID.\nAccordingly, two custom modules are designed to guide the model to actively\nlearn camera-agnostic pedestrian features: Intra-Camera Discriminative Learning\n(ICDL) and Inter-Camera Adversarial Learning (ICAL). Specifically, we first\nestablish learnable textual prompts for intra-camera pedestrian images to\nobtain crucial semantic supervision signals for subsequent intra- and\ninter-camera learning. Then, we design ICDL to increase inter-class variation\nby considering the hard positive and hard negative samples within each camera,\nthereby learning intra-camera finer-grained pedestrian features. Additionally,\nwe propose ICAL to reduce inter-camera pedestrian feature discrepancies by\npenalizing the model's ability to predict the camera from which a pedestrian\nimage originates, thus enhancing the model's capability to recognize\npedestrians from different viewpoints. Extensive experiments on popular ReID\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

However, inference model trained from data in a\nparticular geographical region faces poor generalization when applied in other\nregions due to inter-city data domain-shift. Hierarchical Federated Learning\n(HFL) offers a potential solution for improving TriSU model generalization by\ncollaborative privacy-preserving training over distributed datasets from\ndifferent cities. Unfortunately, it suffers from slow convergence because data\nfrom different cities are with disparate statistical properties. Going beyond\nexisting HFL methods, we propose a Gaussian heterogeneous HFL algorithm\n(FedGau) to address inter-city data heterogeneity so that convergence can be\naccelerated. In the proposed FedGau algorithm, both single RGB image and RGB\ndataset are modelled as Gaussian distributions for aggregation weight design.\nThis approach not only differentiates each RGB image by respective statistical\ndistribution, but also exploits the statistics of dataset from each city in\naddition to the conventionally considered data volume. With the proposed\napproach, the convergence is accelerated by 35.5\\%-40.6\\% compared to existing\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) HFL methods. On the other hand, to reduce the involved\ncommunication resource, we further introduce a novel performance-aware adaptive\nresource scheduling (AdapRS) policy. Unlike the traditional static resource\nscheduling policy that exchanges a fixed number of models between two adjacent\naggregations, AdapRS adjusts the number of model aggregation at different\nlevels of HFL so that unnecessary communications are minimized. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that AdapRS saves 29.65\\% communication overhead\ncompared to conventional static resource scheduling policy while maintaining\nalmost the same performance.",

However,\nanalyzing XAS data presents significant challenges, often requiring extensive,\ncomputationally intensive simulations, as well as significant domain expertise.\nThese limitations hinder the development of fast, robust XAS analysis pipelines\nthat are essential in high-throughput studies and for autonomous\nexperimentation. We address these challenges with OmniXAS, a framework that\ncontains a suite of transfer learning approaches for XAS prediction, each\ncontributing to improved accuracy and efficiency, as demonstrated on K-edge\nspectra database covering eight 3d transition metals (Ti-Cu). The OmniXAS\nframework is built upon three distinct strategies. First, we use M3GNet to\nderive latent representations of the local chemical environment of absorption\nsites as input for XAS prediction, achieving up to order-of-magnitude\nimprovements over conventional featurization techniques. Second, we employ a\nhierarchical transfer learning strategy, training a universal multi-task model\nacross elements before fine-tuning for element-specific predictions. Models\nbased on this cascaded approach after element-wise fine-tuning outperform\nelement-specific models by up to 69%. Third, we implement cross-fidelity\ntransfer learning, adapting a universal model to predict spectra generated by\nsimulation of a different fidelity with a higher computational cost. This\napproach improves prediction accuracy by up to 11% over models trained on the\ntarget fidelity alone. Our approach boosts the throughput of XAS modeling by\norders of magnitude versus first-principles simulations and is extendable to\nXAS prediction for a broader range of elements.

    "abstract": "Similarity matrix serves as a fundamental tool at the core of numerous\ndownstream machine-learning tasks. However, missing data is inevitable and\noften results in an inaccurate similarity matrix. To address this issue,\nSimilarity Matrix Completion (SMC) methods have been proposed, but they suffer\nfrom high computation complexity due to the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\noperation. To reduce the computation complexity, Matrix Factorization (MF)\ntechniques are more explicit and frequently applied to provide a low-rank\nsolution, but the exact low-rank optimal solution can not be guaranteed since\nit suffers from a non-convex structure. In this paper, we introduce a novel SMC\nframework that offers a more reliable and efficient solution. Specifically,\nbeyond simply utilizing the unique Positive Semi-definiteness (PSD) property to\nguide the completion process, our approach further complements a carefully\ndesigned rank-minimization regularizer, aiming to achieve an optimal and\nlow-rank solution. Based on the key insights that the underlying PSD property\nand Low-Rank property improve the SMC performance, we present two novel,\nscalable, and effective algorithms, SMCNN and SMCNmF, which investigate the PSD\nproperty to guide the estimation process and incorporate nonconvex low-rank\nregularizer to ensure the low-rank solution.

With accurate and timely\nforecasts, employers can adapt their recruitment strategies to align with the\nevolving labor market, and employees can have proactive career path planning\naccording to future demand and supply. However, previous studies ignore the\ninterconnection between demand-supply sequences among different companies and\npositions for predicting variations. Moreover, companies are reluctant to share\ntheir private human resource data for global labor market analysis due to\nconcerns over jeopardizing competitive advantage, security threats, and\npotential ethical or legal violations. To this end, in this paper, we formulate\nthe Federated Labor Market Forecasting (FedLMF) problem and propose a\nMeta-personalized Convergence-aware Clustered Federated Learning (MPCAC-FL)\nframework to provide accurate and timely collaborative talent demand and supply\nprediction in a privacy-preserving way. First, we design a graph-based\nsequential model to capture the inherent correlation between demand and supply\nsequences and company-position pairs. Second, we adopt meta-learning techniques\nto learn effective initial model parameters that can be shared across\ncompanies, allowing personalized models to be optimized for forecasting\ncompany-specific demand and supply, even when companies have heterogeneous\ndata. Third, we devise a Convergence-aware Clustering algorithm to dynamically\ndivide companies into groups according to model similarity and apply federated\naggregation in each group. The heterogeneity can be alleviated for more stable\nconvergence and better performance.

In this paper,\nwe explore a new perspective called \"Knowledge Decomposition\" to improve the\nperformance on specific medical tasks, which deconstructs the foundation model\ninto multiple lightweight expert models, each dedicated to a particular\nanatomical region, with the aim of enhancing specialization and simultaneously\nreducing resource consumption. To accomplish the above objective, we propose a\nnovel framework named Low-Rank Knowledge Decomposition (LoRKD), which\nexplicitly separates gradients from different tasks by incorporating low-rank\nexpert modules and efficient knowledge separation convolution. The low-rank\nexpert modules resolve gradient conflicts between heterogeneous data from\ndifferent anatomical regions, providing strong specialization at lower costs.\nThe efficient knowledge separation convolution significantly improves algorithm\nefficiency by achieving knowledge separation within a single forward\npropagation. Extensive experimental results on segmentation and classification\ntasks demonstrate that our decomposed models not only achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance but also exhibit superior transferability on downstream tasks, even\nsurpassing the original foundation models in task-specific evaluations.

This paper provides a focused review of key considerations and\npresents a unified framework to enhance infrasound processing approaches\nspecifically tailored for bolides. Three representative case studies are\npresented to demonstrate the practical application of infrasound processing\nmethodologies and deriving source parameters, while exploring challenges\nassociated with bolide-generated infrasound. These case studies underscore the\neffectiveness of infrasound in determining source parameters and highlight\ninterpretative challenges, such as variations in signal period measurements\nacross different studies. Future research should place emphasis on improving\ngeolocation and yield accuracy. This can be achieved through rigorous and\nsystematic analyses of large, statistically significant samples of such events.\naiming to resolve interpretative inconsistencies and explore the causes for\nvariability in signal periods and back azimuths.

When the scalar mass of f(R) is zero, the\nmixed mode will reduce to a pure breathing mode with the disappearance of the\nlongitudinal mode.

This study quantitatively reveals an \"impossible trinity\" among data\nquantity, diversity, and quality in pre-training datasets. Recent efforts seek\nto refine large-scale, diverse ASR datasets compromised by low quality through\nsynthetic annotations. These methods successfully leverage useful information\nin multimodal video content (frames, tags, ASR transcripts, etc.) to refine the\noriginal annotations. Nevertheless, they struggle to mitigate noise within\nsynthetic annotations and lack scalability as the dataset size expands. To\naddress these issues, we introduce the Video DataFlywheel framework, which\niteratively refines video annotations with improved noise control methods. For\niterative refinement, we first leverage a video-language model to generate\nsynthetic annotations, resulting in a refined dataset. Then, we pre-train on it\nand fine-tune on human refinement examples for a stronger model. These\nprocesses are repeated for continuous improvement. For noise control, we\npresent AdaTaiLr, a novel noise control method that requires weaker assumptions\non noise distribution, thereby proving more effective in large datasets with\ntheoretical guarantees. The combination of iterative refinement and AdaTaiLr\ncan achieve better scalability in video-language understanding. Extensive\nexperiments show that our framework outperforms existing data refinement\nbaselines, delivering a 3% performance boost and improving dataset quality with\nminimal diversity loss.

    "abstract": "Urban Building Exteriors are increasingly important in urban analytics,\ndriven by advancements in Street View Imagery and its integration with urban\nresearch. Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful tools for\nurban annotation, enabling deeper insights into urban environments. However,\nchallenges remain in creating accurate and detailed urban building exterior\ndatabases, identifying critical indicators for energy efficiency, environmental\nsustainability, and human-centric design, and systematically organizing these\nindicators. To address these challenges, we propose BuildingView, a novel\napproach that integrates high-resolution visual data from Google Street View\nwith spatial information from OpenStreetMap via the Overpass API. This research\nimproves the accuracy of urban building exterior data, identifies key\nsustainability and design indicators, and develops a framework for their\nextraction and categorization. Our methodology includes a systematic literature\nreview, building and Street View sampling, and annotation using the ChatGPT-4O\nAPI. The resulting database, validated with data from New York City, Amsterdam,\nand Singapore, provides a comprehensive tool for urban studies, supporting\ninformed decision-making in urban planning, architectural design, and\nenvironmental policy.

    "abstract": "Multimodal contrastive learning uses various data modalities to create\nhigh-quality features, but its reliance on extensive data sources on the\nInternet makes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks. These attacks insert\nmalicious behaviors during training, which are activated by specific triggers\nduring inference, posing significant security risks. Despite existing\ncountermeasures through fine-tuning that reduce the malicious impacts of such\nattacks, these defenses frequently necessitate extensive training time and\ndegrade clean accuracy. In this study, we propose an efficient defense\nmechanism against backdoor threats using a concept known as machine unlearning.\nThis entails strategically creating a small set of poisoned samples to aid the\nmodel's rapid unlearning of backdoor vulnerabilities, known as Unlearn Backdoor\nThreats (UBT). We specifically use overfit training to improve backdoor\nshortcuts and accurately detect suspicious samples in the potential poisoning\ndata set. Then, we select fewer unlearned samples from suspicious samples for\nrapid forgetting in order to eliminate the backdoor effect and thus improve\nbackdoor defense efficiency. In the backdoor unlearning process, we present a\nnovel token-based portion unlearning training regime. This technique focuses on\nthe model's compromised elements, dissociating backdoor correlations while\nmaintaining the model's overall integrity. Extensive experimental results show\nthat our method effectively defends against various backdoor attack methods in\nthe CLIP model. Compared to SoTA backdoor defense methods, UBT achieves the\nlowest attack success rate while maintaining a high clean accuracy of the model\n(attack success rate decreases by 19% compared to SOTA, while clean accuracy\nincreases by 2.57%).",

We compare the charge\n$G_C$, magnetic $G_M$, and quadrupole $G_Q$ form factors with lattice data. The\ndressed form factors, $G_C^D$ and $G_M^D$, exhibit good agreement with lattice\nresults; however, $G_Q^D$ is found to be harder than what is observed in\nlattice calculations. The Rosenbluth cross section for elastic electron\nscattering on a spin-one particle can be expressed through the structure\nfunctions $A(Q^2)$ and $B(Q^2)$. Additionally, the tensor polarization\n$T_{20}(Q^2,\\theta)$ can also be formulated in terms of these form factors. We\nanalyze the structure functions $A(Q^2)$, $B(Q^2)$ and tensor polarization\nfunction $T_{20}(Q^2,\\theta)$; our findings quantitatively align with predicted\nvalues across various limits.

    "abstract": "Persuasive scholarship presents how individual daily travel habits implicate\ncongestion, environmental pollution, and the travel experience. However, the\nempirical characteristics and dynamics of travel habits remain poorly\nunderstood. Quantifying both our individual travel habits and how these habits\naggregate to form system-wide dynamics is of critical importance to enable the\nsmart design of public transit systems that are better tailored to our daily\nmobility needs. We contribute to this need through the development and\nimplementation of a new measurement framework capturing the 'peakedness' of\nusers' departure time distributions. Departure time 'peakedness' reflects a\nuser's tendency to repeatedly choose the same departure time for a given\norigin-destination trip, offering a clearer and more intuitive representation\nof regularity and habitual patterns compared to traditional metrics like\nstandard deviation or entropy. Our framework demonstrates that system-wide\ndeparture time peakedness can be decomposed into individual users' departure\ntime peakedness and the alignment of their peak times. This allows for a\nsystematic analysis of both individual and collective behaviours. We apply our\nframework to departure time data from a 12-month period, encompassing 5,947,907\nbus journeys made by 29,640 individuals across three urban networks within a\nlarge regional metropolis. Our findings reveal that departure time peakedness\nis more deeply tied to inherent, passenger-specific characteristics, such as\npassenger type, rather than external factors like weather or holidays.\nAdditionally, individual-level departure time peakedness shows notable dynamics\nover time, indicating that habitual routines can evolve in the long term, while\nsystem-level peakedness exhibits remarkable long-term stability.",

The kagome strip\nchain Heisenberg model, composed of a hexagonal net of triangles forming\nfive-site unit cells, exhibits four magnetization plateaus in the presence of\nan applied magnetic field. Using numerical density matrix renormalization group\nmethod, we find that the magnetization plateaus are stable against anisotropic\ninteractions in the same direction of the applied magnetic field, but the\nplateaus become much smaller with anisotropic interactions in other directions.\nWe further show the anisotropic effect of the magnon excitations of the 0.6\nplateau state using linear spin wave theory. The magnon bandwidth remains small\nwhen tuning the anisotropic interactions along the field where the\nmagnetization plateau is stable, while the band becomes more dispersive with\nanisotropic interactions perpendicular to the field. In addition, upon tuning\ndown the interaction strength for the two lower legs below a critical value,\nthe Hamiltonian of the kagome strip chain is dominated by two separate spin\nchains. This can be used to determine the effective lattice structure in\nmaterials with strong distortions.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving framework for training\nmachine learning models on mobile edge devices. Traditional FL algorithms,\ne.g., FedAvg, impose a heavy communication workload on these devices. To\nmitigate this issue, Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning (HFEL) has been\nproposed, leveraging edge servers as intermediaries for model aggregation.\nDespite its effectiveness, HFEL encounters challenges such as a slow\nconvergence rate and high resource consumption, particularly in the presence of\nsystem and data heterogeneity. However, existing works are mainly focused on\nimproving training efficiency for traditional FL, leaving the efficiency of\nHFEL largely unexplored. In this paper, we consider a two-tier HFEL system,\nwhere edge devices are connected to edge servers and edge servers are\ninterconnected through peer-to-peer (P2P) edge backhauls. Our goal is to\nenhance the training efficiency of the HFEL system through strategic resource\nallocation and topology design. Specifically, we formulate an optimization\nproblem to minimize the total training latency by allocating the computation\nand communication resources, as well as adjusting the P2P connections. To\nensure convergence under dynamic topologies, we analyze the convergence error\nbound and introduce a model consensus constraint into the optimization problem.\nThe proposed problem is then decomposed into several subproblems, enabling us\nto alternatively solve it online. Our method facilitates the efficient\nimplementation of large-scale FL at edge networks under data and system\nheterogeneity. Comprehensive experiment evaluation on benchmark datasets\nvalidates the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating significant\nreductions in training latency while maintaining the model accuracy compared to\nvarious baselines.",

    "abstract": "Neural backdoors represent insidious cybersecurity loopholes that render\nlearning machinery vulnerable to unauthorised manipulations, potentially\nenabling the weaponisation of artificial intelligence with catastrophic\nconsequences. A backdoor attack involves the clandestine infiltration of a\ntrigger during the learning process, metaphorically analogous to hypnopaedia,\nwhere ideas are implanted into a subject's subconscious mind under the state of\nhypnosis or unconsciousness. When activated by a sensory stimulus, the trigger\nevokes conditioned reflex that directs a machine to mount a predetermined\nresponse. In this study, we propose a cybernetic framework for constant\nsurveillance of backdoors threats, driven by the dynamic nature of\nuntrustworthy data sources. We develop a self-aware unlearning mechanism to\nautonomously detach a machine's behaviour from the backdoor trigger. Through\nreverse engineering and statistical inference, we detect deceptive patterns and\nestimate the likelihood of backdoor infection. We employ model inversion to\nelicit artificial mental imagery, using stochastic processes to disrupt\noptimisation pathways and avoid convergent but potentially flawed patterns.\nThis is followed by hypothesis analysis, which estimates the likelihood of each\npotentially malicious pattern being the true trigger and infers the probability\nof infection. The primary objective of this study is to maintain a stable state\nof equilibrium between knowledge fidelity and backdoor vulnerability.",

We conduct high-resolution controlled\nN-body simulations to show that a collapsed SIDM halo could account for the\nGD-1 perturber's high density.

LLM-powered chatbots like\nChatGPT are gaining prominence among the general public. AI chatbots are also\nincreasingly producing content on social media platforms. However, LLMs are\nalso prone to hallucinations, generating plausible yet factually incorrect or\nfabricated information. This becomes a critical problem when laypeople start\nseeking information about sensitive issues such as healthcare. Existing works\nin LLM hallucinations in the medical domain mainly focus on testing the medical\nknowledge of LLMs through standardized medical exam questions which are often\nwell-defined and clear-cut with definitive answers. However, these approaches\nmay not fully capture how these LLMs perform during real-world interactions\nwith patients. This work conducts a pioneering study on hallucinations in\nLLM-generated responses to real-world healthcare queries from patients.We\nintroduce MedHalu, a novel medical hallucination benchmark featuring diverse\nhealth-related topics and hallucinated responses from LLMs, with detailed\nannotation of the hallucination types and text spans.
