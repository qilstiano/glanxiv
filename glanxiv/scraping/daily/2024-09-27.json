    "abstract": "Jaynes-Cummings (JC) lattices can be constructed by connecting quantum\ntwo-level systems with cavities and have been widely studied for polariton\nmany-body states and multipartite entanglement. Although adiabatic evolution\nhas been studied for the generation of many-body states in this system, its\nreliance on long timescales can lead to serious decoherence. Here we present a\nscheme that utilizes local counterdiabatic (CD) driving to provide fast and\nhigh-fidelity state preparation in JC lattices. The exact CD Hamiltonian for\nthis system contains nonlocal couplings between qubits and cavities at\ndifferent and distant sites, which causes a challenge in the implementation.\nLeveraging the symmetries of the eigenstates under both periodic and open\nboundary conditions, we derive a local CD Hamiltonian that generates the same\ndynamics as the exact CD Hamiltonian and our numerical simulations confirm this\nresult. We also show that a multipartite W-state can be prepared with high\nfidelity using this method. The implementation and decoherence of this scheme\nwith superconducting quantum devices are also discussed.",

Since they often appear as small, irregular structures with\nindistinguishable edges in knee magnetic resonance images (MRIs), effective\ndetection of BMLs in MRI is vital for OA diagnosis and treatment. This paper\nproposes a semi-supervised local anomaly detection method using mask inpainting\nmodels for identification of BMLs in high-resolution knee MRI, effectively\nintegrating a 3D femur bone segmentation model, a large mask inpainting model,\nand a series of post-processing techniques. The method was evaluated using MRIs\nat various resolutions from a subset of the public Osteoarthritis Initiative\ndatabase. Dice score, Intersection over Union (IoU), and pixel-level\nsensitivity, specificity, and accuracy showed an advantage over the\nmultiresolution knowledge distillation method-a state-of-the-art global anomaly\ndetection method. Especially, segmentation performance is enhanced on\nhigher-resolution images, achieving an over two times performance increase on\nthe Dice score and the IoU score at a 448x448 resolution level. We also\ndemonstrate that with increasing size of the BML region, both the Dice and IoU\nscores improve as the proportion of distinguishable boundary decreases. The\nidentified BML masks can serve as markers for downstream tasks such as\nsegmentation and classification. The proposed method has shown a potential in\nimproving BML detection, laying a foundation for further advances in\nimaging-based OA research.",

We performed a study that compared the security and\nquality of human-written code with that of LLM-generated code, for a wide range\nof programming tasks, including data structures, algorithms, cryptographic\nroutines, and LeetCode questions. To assess code security we used unit testing,\nfuzzing, and static analysis. For code quality, we focused on complexity and\nsize. We found that LLM can generate incorrect code that fails to implement the\nrequired functionality, especially for more complicated tasks; such errors can\nbe subtle. For example, for the cryptographic algorithm SHA1, LLM generated an\nincorrect implementation that nevertheless compiles. In cases where its\nfunctionality was correct, we found that LLM-generated code is less secure,\nprimarily due to the lack of defensive programming constructs, which invites a\nhost of security issues such as buffer overflows or integer overflows. Fuzzing\nhas revealed that LLM-generated code is more prone to hangs and crashes than\nhuman-written code. Quality-wise, we found that LLM generates bare-bones code\nthat lacks defensive programming constructs, and is typically more complex (per\nline of code) compared to human-written code. Next, we constructed a feedback\nloop that asked the LLM to re-generate the code and eliminate the found issues\n(e.g., malloc overflow, array index out of bounds, null dereferences). We found\nthat the LLM fails to eliminate such issues consistently: while succeeding in\nsome cases, we found instances where the re-generated, supposedly more secure\ncode, contains new issues; we also found that upon prompting, LLM can introduce\nissues in files that were issues-free before prompting.",

Their work presented these ideas clearly\nbut ultimately led them outside of the usual category of polynomial functors to\na particular \\emph{tricategory} of polynomials in order to explain all of the\nstructure possessed by such models. This paper builds off that work --\nexplicating the categorical semantics of dependent type theory by axiomatizing\nthem entirely in terms of the usual category of polynomial functors. In order\nto handle the higher-categorical coherences required for such an explanation,\nwe work with polynomial functors in the language of Homotopy Type Theory\n(HoTT), which allows for higher-dimensional structures to be expressed purely\nwithin this category. The move to HoTT moreover enables us to express a key\nadditional condition on polynomial functors -- \\emph{univalence} -- which is\nsufficient to guarantee that models of type theory expressed as univalent\npolynomials satisfy all higher coherences of their corresponding algebraic\nstructures, purely in virtue of being closed under the usual constructors of\ndependent type theory. We call polynomial functors satisfying this condition\n\\emph{polynomial universes}. As an example of the simplification to the theory\nof natural models this enables, we highlight the fact that a polynomial\nuniverse being closed under dependent product types implies the existence of a\ndistributive law of monads, which witnesses the usual distributivity of\ndependent products over dependent sums.",

A multi-modal deep\nlearning AMIL model was developed, combining US images and MT to classify the\nnodules as benign or malignant and enhance the malignancy risk stratification\nof MT.\n  Results: The final AMIL model matched MT sensitivity (0.946) while\nsignificantly improving PPV (0.477 vs 0.448 for MT alone), indicating fewer\nfalse positives while maintaining high sensitivity.\n  Conclusion: Our approach reduces false positives compared to MT while\nmaintaining the same ability to identify positive cases, potentially reducing\nunnecessary benign thyroid resections in patients with indeterminate nodules.",

    "abstract": "Our team developed a riding ballbot (called PURE) that is dynamically stable,\nomnidirectional, and driven by lean-to-steer control. A hands-free admittance\ncontrol scheme (HACS) was previously integrated to allow riders with different\ntorso functions to control the robot's movements via torso leaning and\ntwisting. Such an interface requires motor coordination skills and could result\nin collisions with obstacles due to low proficiency. Hence, a shared controller\n(SC) that limits the speed of PURE could be helpful to ensure the safety of\nriders. However, the self-balancing dynamics of PURE could result in a weak\ncontrol authority of its motion, in which the torso motion of the rider could\neasily result in poor tracking of the command speed dictated by the shared\ncontroller. Thus, we proposed an interactive hands-free admittance control\nscheme (iHACS), which added two modules to HACS to improve the speed-tracking\nperformance of PURE: control gain personalization module and interaction\ncompensation module. Human riding tests of simple tasks, idle-keeping and\nspeed-limiting, were conducted to compare the performance of HACS and iHACS.\nTwo manual wheelchair users and two able-bodied individuals participated in\nthis study. They were instructed to use \"adversarial\" torso motions that would\ntax the SC's ability to keep the ballbot idling or below a set speed. In the\nidle-keeping tasks, iHACS demonstrated minimal translational motion and low\ncommand speed tracking RMSE, even with significant torso lean angles. During\nthe speed-limiting task with command speed saturated at 0.5 m/s, the system\nachieved an average maximum speed of 1.1 m/s with iHACS, compared with that of\nover 1.9 m/s with HACS. These results suggest that iHACS can enhance PURE's\ncontrol authority over the rider, which enables PURE to provide physical\ninteractions back to the rider and results in a collaborative rider-robot\nsynergy.",

    "abstract": "In the domain of recommendation and collaborative filtering, Graph\nContrastive Learning (GCL) has become an influential approach. Nevertheless,\nthe reasons for the effectiveness of contrastive learning are still not well\nunderstood. In this paper, we challenge the conventional use of random\naugmentations on graph structure or embedding space in GCL, which may disrupt\nthe structural and semantic information inherent in Graph Neural Networks.\nMoreover, fixed-rate data augmentation proves to be less effective compared to\naugmentation with an adaptive rate. In the initial training phases, significant\nperturbations are more suitable, while as the training approaches convergence,\nmilder perturbations yield better results. We introduce a twin encoder in place\nof random augmentations, demonstrating the redundancy of traditional\naugmentation techniques. The twin encoder updating mechanism ensures the\ngeneration of more diverse contrastive views in the early stages, transitioning\nto views with greater similarity as training progresses. In addition, we\ninvestigate the learned representations from the perspective of alignment and\nuniformity on a hypersphere to optimize more efficiently. Our proposed Twin\nGraph Contrastive Learning model -- TwinCL -- aligns positive pairs of user and\nitem embeddings and the representations from the twin encoder while maintaining\nthe uniformity of the embeddings on the hypersphere. Our theoretical analysis\nand experimental results show that the proposed model optimizing alignment and\nuniformity with the twin encoder contributes to better recommendation accuracy\nand training efficiency performance. In comprehensive experiments on three\npublic datasets, our proposed TwinCL achieves an average improvement of 5.6%\n(NDCG@10) in recommendation accuracy with faster training speed, while\neffectively mitigating popularity bias.",

    "abstract": "The Superficial Alignment Hypothesis posits that almost all of a language\nmodel's abilities and knowledge are learned during pre-training, while\npost-training is about giving a model the right style and format. We re-examine\nthese claims by empirically studying the scaling behavior of post-training with\nincreasing finetuning examples and evaluating them using objective\ntask-specific standardized benchmarks. Through experiments with the Llama-3,\nMistral, and Llama-2 model families of multiple sizes, we observe that, similar\nto the pre-training scaling laws, post-training task performance scales as a\npower law against the number of finetuning examples. This power law\nrelationship holds across a broad array of capabilities, including mathematical\nreasoning, coding, instruction following, and multihop-reasoning. In addition,\nfor tasks like math and multihop reasoning, we observe that a handful of\nexamples merely align the model stylistically but do not saturate performance\non the benchmarks. Model performance is instead correlated with its reasoning\nability and it improves significantly with more examples, illustrating the need\nfor holistic evaluation programs leveraging objective benchmarks in addition to\nmeasurement of alignment to human preferences. We also observe that language\nmodels are not necessarily limited to using knowledge learned during\npre-training. With appropriate post-training, a model's ability to integrate\nnew knowledge greatly improves on downstream tasks like multihop\nquestion-answering. Taken together, these results shed new light on the\nSuperficial Alignment Hypothesis, suggesting that it is, at best, an\nover-simplification.",

Image-based retrieval is essential, as it allows an astronomer\nwith a source under study to ask a computer to sift through the large archived\ndatabase of sources to find the most similar ones. This is of particular\ninterest if the source under study does not fall into a \"known\" category\n(anomalous). Our work uses the trainable COSFIRE (Combination of Shifted Filter\nResponses) approach for image retrieval. COSFIRE filters are automatically\nconfigured to extract the hyperlocal geometric arrangements that uniquely\ndescribe the morphological characteristics of patterns of interest in a given\nimage; in this case astronomical sources. This is achieved by automatically\nexamining the shape properties of a given prototype source in an image, which\nultimately determines the selectivity of a COSFIRE filter. We further utilize\nhashing techniques, which are efficient in terms of required computation and\nstorage, enabling scalability in handling large data sets in the image\nretrieval process. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach by conducting\nexperiments on a benchmark data set of radio galaxies, containing 1,180\ntraining images and 404 test images. Notably, our approach achieved a mean\naverage precision of 91% for image retrieval, surpassing the performance of the\ncompeting DenseNet-based method. Moreover, the COSFIRE filters are\nsignificantly more computationally efficient, requiring $\\sim\\!14\\times$ fewer\noperations than the DenseNet-based method.",

The\ntraditional solution for SfM consists of a complex pipeline of minimal solvers\nwhich tends to propagate errors and fails when images do not sufficiently\noverlap, have too little motion, etc. Recent methods have attempted to revisit\nthis paradigm, but we empirically show that they fall short of fixing these\ncore issues. In this paper, we propose instead to build upon a recently\nreleased foundation model for 3D vision that can robustly produce local 3D\nreconstructions and accurate matches. We introduce a low-memory approach to\naccurately align these local reconstructions in a global coordinate system. We\nfurther show that such foundation models can serve as efficient image\nretrievers without any overhead, reducing the overall complexity from quadratic\nto linear. Overall, our novel SfM pipeline is simple, scalable, fast and truly\nunconstrained, i.e. it can handle any collection of images, ordered or not.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our method provides\nsteady performance across diverse settings, especially outperforming existing\nmethods in small- and medium-scale settings.",

We thus emphasise the importance of task-appropriate data for XLR\nlanguages: parallel examples for translation, and grammatical data for\nlinguistic tasks.

Gaseous Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) offer the\nrequired gain and readout granularity, but must be large to achieve the\nrequired volume. Therefore, scalable, cost-effective readout technologies are\nessential. High-resolution x/y strip readouts, previously identified as the\noptimal balance between cost-efficiency and performance, are examined here. To\nguide the readout design of a 40-L detector under construction, we present a\ncomparative analysis of 9 x/y strip configurations with Micromegas\namplification. Each setup employs VMM3a front-end ASICs within the RD51\nScalable Readout System (SRS) for strip readout and a pulse height analyzer for\nreading out the Micromegas mesh. These techniques assess gain, gain resolution,\nx/y charge sharing, and spatial resolution of each setup. Configurations with a\ndiamond-like carbon (DLC) layer exhibit improved spark resistance, allowing\nlarger maximal gain and improved fractional gain resolution without notable\nimpact on the spatial resolution. Although the DLC reduces the signal in the\nstrips situated lower in the readout, this can be mitigated by narrowing the\nperpendicularly oriented strips above them. Our results allow us to select the\noptimal readout for future detectors. We also observe clear 3D tracks from\nalpha particles, with performance in good agreement with a simple simulation.\nOverall, Micromegas with x/y strip readout are promising for low-energy recoil\nobservatories.

Hence, scaling\nlaws between unresolved sun-as-a-star observables, namely SXR luminosity\n($L_X$) and type-II luminosity ($L_R$), and the physical properties of the\nassociated dynamical events are crucial. Such scaling laws also provide\ninsights into the interconnections between the particle acceleration processes\nacross low-corona to IP space during solar-stellar 'flare- CME- type-II'\nevents. Using long-term solar data in SXR to radio waveband, we derive a\nscaling law between two novel power metrics for the flare and CME-associated\nprocesses. The metrics of 'flare power' ($P_{flare}=\\sqrt{L_X\\phi_{rec}}$) and\n'CME power' ($P_{CME}= \\sqrt{L_R {V_{CME}}^2}$), where $V_{CME}$ is the CME\nspeed, scale as $P_{flare}\\propto P_{CME}^{0.76 \\pm 0.04}$. Besides, $L_X$ and\n$\\phi_{rec}$ show power-law trends with $P_{CME}$ with indices of 1.12$\\pm$0.05\nand 0.61$\\pm$0.05 respectively. These power-laws help infer the spatially\nresolved physical parameters, $V_{CME}$ and $\\phi_{rec}$, from disk-averaged\nobservables, $L_X$ and $L_R$ during solar-stellar 'flare- CME- type-II' events.",

    "abstract": "Speech-driven facial animation aims to synthesize lip-synchronized 3D talking\nfaces following the given speech signal. Prior methods to this task mostly\nfocus on pursuing realism with deterministic systems, yet characterizing the\npotentially stochastic nature of facial motions has been to date rarely\nstudied. While generative modeling approaches can easily handle the one-to-many\nmapping by repeatedly drawing samples, ensuring a diverse mode coverage of\nplausible facial motions on small-scale datasets remains challenging and less\nexplored. In this paper, we propose predicting multiple samples conditioned on\nthe same audio signal and then explicitly encouraging sample diversity to\naddress diverse facial animation synthesis. Our core insight is to guide our\nmodel to explore the expressive facial latent space with a diversity-promoting\nloss such that the desired latent codes for diversification can be ideally\nidentified. To this end, building upon the rich facial prior learned with\nvector-quantized variational auto-encoding mechanism, our model temporally\nqueries multiple stochastic codes which can be flexibly decoded into a diverse\nyet plausible set of speech-faithful facial motions. To further allow for\ncontrol over different facial parts during generation, the proposed model is\ndesigned to predict different facial portions of interest in a sequential\nmanner, and compose them to eventually form full-face motions. Our paradigm\nrealizes both diverse and controllable facial animation synthesis in a unified\nformulation.

This allows the model to adapt to new user interactions in\nreal-time, leading to more accurate recommendations. In this paper, we propose\nTTT4Rec, a sequential recommendation framework that integrates TTT to better\ncapture dynamic user behavior. By continuously updating model parameters during\ninference, TTT4Rec is particularly effective in scenarios where user\ninteraction sequences are long, training data is limited, or user behavior is\nhighly variable.

By\nincorporating physical laws into the training of ESNs, Physics-Informed ESNs\n(PI-ESNs) were proposed initially to model chaotic dynamic systems without\nexternal inputs. They require less data for training since Ordinary\nDifferential Equations (ODEs) of the considered system help to regularize the\nESN. In this work, the PI-ESN is extended with external inputs to model\ncontrollable nonlinear dynamic systems. Additionally, an existing self-adaptive\nbalancing loss method is employed to balance the contributions of the residual\nregression term and the physics-informed loss term in the total loss function.\nThe experiments with two nonlinear systems modeled by ODEs, the Van der Pol\noscillator and the four-tank system, and with one differential-algebraic (DAE)\nsystem, an electric submersible pump, revealed that the proposed PI-ESN\noutperforms the conventional ESN, especially in scenarios with limited data\navailability, showing that PI-ESNs can regularize an ESN model with external\ninputs previously trained on just a few datapoints, reducing its overfitting\nand improving its generalization error (up to 92% relative reduction in the\ntest error).

Our\nobjectives were to assess the performance of adaptive AI agents designed with\nhierarchical reinforcement learning for better teamwork and measure eye\ntracking signals related to changes in trust and collaboration.

This work is motivated by the MILPs\nbeing able to model problems in multi-agent autonomy, such as task assignment\nproblems and trajectory planning with collision avoidance constraints in\nmulti-robot systems. To solve a MILP, we relax it with a linear program\napproximation. We first show that if the linear program relaxation satisfies\nSlater's condition, then relaxing the problem, solving it, and rounding the\nrelaxed solution produces a point that is guaranteed to satisfy the constraints\nof the original MILP. Next, we form a Lagrangian saddle point problem that is\nequivalent to the linear program relaxation, and then we regularize the\nLagrangian in both the primal and dual spaces. Doing so gives a regularized\nLagrangian that is strongly convex-strongly concave. We then develop a\nparallelized algorithm to compute saddle points of the regularized Lagrangian,\nand we show that it is tolerant to asynchrony in the computations and\ncommunications of primal and dual variables. Suboptimality bounds and\nconvergence rates are presented for convergence to a saddle point. The\nsuboptimality bound accounts for (i) the error induced by regularizing the\nLagrangian and (ii) the suboptimality gap between the solution to the original\nMILP and the solution to its relaxed form. Simulation results illustrate these\ntheoretical developments in practice, and show that relaxation and\nregularization combined typically have only a mild impact on the suboptimality\nof the solution obtained.",

    "abstract": "Video encompasses both visual and auditory data, creating a perceptually rich\nexperience where these two modalities complement each other. As such, videos\nare a valuable type of media for the investigation of the interplay between\naudio and visual elements. Previous studies of audio-visual modalities\nprimarily focused on either audio-visual representation learning or generative\nmodeling of a modality conditioned on the other, creating a disconnect between\nthese two branches. A unified framework that learns representation and\ngenerates modalities has not been developed yet. In this work, we introduce a\nnovel framework called Vision to Audio and Beyond (VAB) to bridge the gap\nbetween audio-visual representation learning and vision-to-audio generation.\nThe key approach of VAB is that rather than working with raw video frames and\naudio data, VAB performs representation learning and generative modeling within\nlatent spaces. In particular, VAB uses a pre-trained audio tokenizer and an\nimage encoder to obtain audio tokens and visual features, respectively. It then\nperforms the pre-training task of visual-conditioned masked audio token\nprediction. This training strategy enables the model to engage in contextual\nlearning and simultaneous video-to-audio generation. After the pre-training\nphase, VAB employs the iterative-decoding approach to rapidly generate audio\ntokens conditioned on visual features. Since VAB is a unified model, its\nbackbone can be fine-tuned for various audio-visual downstream tasks. Our\nexperiments showcase the efficiency of VAB in producing high-quality audio from\nvideo, and its capability to acquire semantic audio-visual features, leading to\ncompetitive results in audio-visual retrieval and classification.",

However, existing studies\noften focus on a single domain or modality, neglecting the valuable\ncomplementary information offered by multiple domains from both fMRI and EEG,\nwhich is crucial for a comprehensive representation of disorder pathology. This\nlimitation poses a challenge in effectively leveraging the synergistic\ninformation derived from these modalities. To address this, we propose a\nMulti-modal Cross-domain Self-supervised Pre-training Model (MCSP), a novel\napproach that leverages self-supervised learning to synergize multi-modal\ninformation across spatial, temporal, and spectral domains. Our model employs\ncross-domain self-supervised loss that bridges domain differences by\nimplementing domain-specific data augmentation and contrastive loss, enhancing\nfeature discrimination. Furthermore, MCSP introduces cross-modal\nself-supervised loss to capitalize on the complementary information of fMRI and\nEEG, facilitating knowledge distillation within domains and maximizing\ncross-modal feature convergence. We constructed a large-scale pre-training\ndataset and pretrained MCSP model by leveraging proposed self-supervised\nparadigms to fully harness multimodal neuroimaging data. Through comprehensive\nexperiments, we have demonstrated the superior performance and generalizability\nof our model on multiple classification tasks.

On the one hand, the model-based framework is convenient for\nproducing probabilistic estimates of cluster assignments and uncertainty. On\nthe other hand, the specification of a mixture model is fraught with the danger\nof misspecification that could lead to inconsistent clustering estimates.\nGraphical model-based clustering takes a different model specification\nstrategy, in which the likelihood treats the data as arising dependently from a\ndisjoint union of component graphs. To counter the large uncertainty of the\ngraph, recent work on Bayesian spanning forest proposes using the integrated\nposterior of the node partition, marginalized over the latent edge\ndistribution, to produce probabilistic estimates for clustering. Despite strong\nempirical performance, it is not yet known whether the clustering estimator is\nconsistent, especially when the data-generating mechanism is different from the\nspecified graphical model. This article gives a positive answer in the\nasymptotic regime: when the data arise from an unknown mixture distribution,\nunder mild conditions, the posterior concentrates on the ground-truth\npartition, producing correct clustering estimates, including the number of\nclusters. Our result holds for both cases when the number of clusters is fixed\nor diverging as the sample size increases, and further provides a statistical\nupper bound of the misclassification rate.

The Argonne-based code, NekRS, is a highly-performant open-source\ncode for the simulation of incompressible and low-Mach fluid flow, heat\ntransfer, and combustion with a particular focus on turbulent flows in complex\ndomains. It is based on rapidly convergent high-order spectral element\ndiscretizations that feature minimal numerical dissipation and dispersion.\nState-of-the-art multilevel preconditioners, efficient high-order\ntime-splitting methods, and runtime-adaptive communication strategies are built\non a fast OCCA-based kernel library, libParanumal, to provide scalability and\nportability across the spectrum of current and future high-performance\ncomputing platforms. On Frontier, Nek5000/RS has achieved an unprecedented\nmilestone in breaching over 1 trillion degrees of freedom with the spectral\nelement methods for the simulation of the CHIMERA fusion technology testing\nplatform. We also demonstrate for the first time the use of high-order overset\ngrids at scale.",

    "abstract": "Consider a path of the reflected Brownian motion in the half-plane $\\{y \\ge\n0\\}$, and erase its part contained in the interior $\\{y > 0\\}$. What is left\nis, in an appropriate sense, a path of a jump-type stochastic process on the\nline $\\{y = 0\\}$ -- the boundary trace of the reflected Brownian motion. It is\nwell known that this process is in fact the 1-stable L\\'evy process, also known\nas the Cauchy process.\n  The PDE interpretation of the above fact is the following. Consider a bounded\nharmonic function $u$ in the half-plane $\\{y > 0\\}$, with sufficiently smooth\nboundary values $f$. Let $g$ denote the normal derivative of $u$ at the\nboundary. The mapping $f \\mapsto g$ is known as the Dirichlet-to-Neumann\noperator, and it is again well known that this operator coincides with the\nsquare root of the 1-D Laplace operator $-\\Delta$. Thus, the\nDirichlet-to-Neumann operator coincides with the generator of the boundary\ntrace process.\n  Molchanov and Ostrovskii proved that isotropic stable L\\'evy processes are\nboundary traces of appropriate diffusions in half-spaces. Caffarelli and\nSilvestre gave a PDE counterpart of this result: the fractional Laplace\noperator is the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for an appropriate second-order\nelliptic equation in the half-space. Again, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator\nturns out to be the generator of the boundary trace process.\n  During my talk I will discuss boundary trace processes and\nDirichlet-to-Neumann operators in a more general context. My main goal will be\nto explain the connections between probabilistic and analytical results. Along\nthe way, I will introduce the necessary machinery: Brownian local times and\nadditive functionals, Krein's spectral theory of strings, and Fourier transform\nmethods.",

Some studies have already examined how realism impacts the comfort of\nviewers. In some cases, the user's comfort is related to human identification.\nFor example, people from a specific group may look positively at others from\nthe same group. Gender is one of those characteristics that have in-group\nadvantages. For example, in terms of VHs, studies have shown that female humans\nare more likely to recognize emotions in female VHs than in male VHs. However,\nthere are many other variables that can impact the user perception. To aid this\ndiscussion, we conducted a study on how people perceive comfort and realism in\nrelation to interactive VHs with different genders and expressing negative,\nneutral, or positive emotions in groups. We created a virtual environment for\nparticipants to interact with groups of VHs, which are interactive and should\nevolve in real-time, using a popular game engine. To animate the characters, we\nopted for cartoon figures that are animated by tracking the facial expressions\nof actors, using available game engine platforms to conduct the driven\nanimation. Our results indicate that the emotion of the VH group impacts both\ncomfort and realism perception, even by using simple cartoon characters in an\ninteractive environment. Furthermore, the findings suggest that individuals\nreported feeling better with a positive emotion compared to a negative emotion,\nand that negative emotion recognition is impacted by the gender of the VHs\ngroup. Additionally, although we used simple characters, the results are\nconsistent with the perception obtained when analysing realistic the\nstate-of-the-art virtual humans, which positive emotions tend to be more\ncorrectly recognized than negative ones.",

Existing approaches pre-train\nmodels for specific graph domains, neglecting the inherent connections within\nnetworks. This limits their ability to transfer knowledge to various supervised\ntasks. In this work, we propose a novel pre-training strategy on graphs that\nfocuses on modeling their multi-resolution structural information, allowing us\nto capture global information of the whole graph while preserving local\nstructures around its nodes. We extend the work of Wave}let Positional Encoding\n(WavePE) from (Ngo et al., 2023) by pretraining a High-Order\nPermutation-Equivariant Autoencoder (HOPE-WavePE) to reconstruct node\nconnectivities from their multi-resolution wavelet signals. Unlike existing\npositional encodings, our method is designed to become sensitivity to the input\ngraph size in downstream tasks, which efficiently capture global structure on\ngraphs. Since our approach relies solely on the graph structure, it is also\ndomain-agnostic and adaptable to datasets from various domains, therefore\npaving the wave for developing general graph structure encoders and graph\nfoundation models. We theoretically demonstrate that there exists a\nparametrization of such architecture that it can predict the output adjacency\nup to arbitrarily low error.

    "abstract": "In this study, we derive the asymptotic expressions for the electrostatic\nforce between two charged spherical conductors in an electric field. Davis\n\\cite{davis1964two} initially provided an expression for these forces, which\nare split into components along the X and Z directions. These forces are\ninfluenced by several factors, including the separation distance between the\nspheres, their sizes, their charges, the applied external electric field, and\n10 specific force coefficients. These coefficients involve complex series\nexpressions, and computing them requires summing up the 24 infinite series. To\ntackle the challenge of series convergence, previous researchers\n(\\cite{lekner2012electrostatics}, \\cite{lekner2013forces},\n\\cite{arp1977particle}) have used various methods to derive asymptotic\nexpressions. In this work, the method of matched asymptotic expansions has been\nimplemented to derive the asymptotic forms of these 24 series, specifically for\nthe scenario involving two equal-sized conducting spheres in an external\nelectric field. Accurate calculation of these series is crucial, especially\nwhen the distance between the spheres is very small, making the series\ncalculations computationally intensive. We utilize the method proposed by Cox\nand Brenner \\cite{Cox1967} to derive the asymptotic expressions and hence\ncompute the 10 force coefficients and finally apply them to compute the\nelectrostatic force for small separations. Additionally, we assess the accuracy\nof these asymptotic expressions by comparing them to the actual series and\nanalyzing their deviations through percentage errors.",

This scenario is realized in the lattice gravity\nmodel associated with the Dirac field as follows. At ultra-high temperatures of\nthe Grand Unification order $T_c\\sim10^{18}$ GeV and higher, the system is in a\nPT-symmetric phase. But when the temperature decreases, a phase transition to\nan asymmetric phase occurs, in which a non-zero tetrad appears, that is,\nspace-time with the Minkowski metric, and the system's wave function splits\ninto two: $|\\rangle=|+\\rangle+|-\\rangle$. The fields of tetrads in states\n$|+\\rangle$ and $|-\\rangle$ differ in sign. At the very first moment of time\nwith a duration of the order of the Planck time, a transition of fermions\nbetween these states is possible. These transitions in different parts of space\nare not correlated with each other. Therefore, the final asymmetry of the\nfermion charge between these states is relatively extremely small and it is\npreserved in time, since the interaction of the states $|+\\rangle$ and\n$|-\\rangle$ ceases at times greater than the Planck time.",

This\nis a marked difference from the current standard practice of using binary, or\none-hot encoding to replace categorical variables with sequences of ones and\nzeros.

The significance of obtaining meaningful\nembeddings is illustrated in the context of an industrial coating process for\ncutting tools that includes both numerical and categorical inputs. In this\nindustrial process, subject matter expertise suggests that the categorical\ninputs are critical for determining the final outcome but this cannot be taken\ninto account with the current state-of-the-art.

In this work, we tackle this\nissue by integrating cosmological simulations and galaxy merger simulations\nfrom the MAGICS-I and MAGICS-II resimulation suites with high-resolution\n$N$-body simulations. Building on the findings of MAGICS-II, which showed that\nonly MBH seeds embedded in stellar systems are able to sink to the center, we\nextend the investigation by incorporating nuclear star clusters (NSCs) into our\nmodels. Utilizing $N$-body resimulations with up to $10^7$ particles, we\ndemonstrate that interactions between NSCs and their surrounding galactic\nenvironment, particularly tidal forces triggered by cluster interactions,\nsignificantly accelerate the sinking of MBHs to the galactic center. This\nprocess leads to the formation of a hard binary in $\\lesssim 500$ Myr after the\nonset of a galaxy merger. Our results show that in 8 out of 12 models, the high\nstellar density of the surrounding NSCs enhances MBH hardening, facilitating\ngravitational wave (GW) mergers by redshift $z = 4$. We conclude that at $z >\n4$, dense NSCs serve as the dominant channel for MBH seed mergers, producing a\nmerger rate of $0.3$--$0.6\\, \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at $z = 4$, which is\napproximately 300--600 times higher than in non-NSC environments.

In this work, we\naddress this gap by calibrating microscopic traffic flow models using\nmacroscopic (aggregated) data, which is more readily accessible. We designed a\nSUMO-in-the-loop calibration framework with the goal of replicating observed\nmacroscopic traffic features.

We compare auctions through the lens of the\nPrice of Anarchy, with respect to three canonical welfare objectives:\nutilitarian social welfare (sum of individuals' utilities), Nash social welfare\n(product of individuals' utilities), and egalitarian social welfare (minimum of\nindividuals' utilities). We prove strong lower bounds on the Price of Anarchy\nof all auctions that allocate each item to the highest bidder, subject to a\nmild technical constraint; this includes Feeding America's current auction, the\nFirst-Price auction. In sharp contrast, our main result shows that adapting the\nclassic Trading Post mechanism of Shapley and Shubik to this setting, and\ncoupled with Feeding America's choice of budget rule (each representative gets\nan amount of artificial currency equal to the number of individuals it\nrepresents), achieves a small Price of Anarchy for all generalized $p$-mean\nobjectives simultaneously. Our bound on the Price of Anarchy of the Trading\nPost mechanism depends on $\\ell$: the product of the rank and the\n``incoherence'' of the underlying valuation matrix, which together capture a\nnotion of how ``spread out'' the values of a matrix are.

This work presents a detailed investigation\nof LDS modelling with temporal aggregation. A novel compact formulation is\nproposed to reduce the number of constraints while effectively tracking the\nstorage content and enforcing limits on the state of charge throughout the\nentire time horizon. The developed method is compared with two leading\nstate-of-the-art formulations. All three methods are implemented in the Dolphyn\ncapacity expansion model and tested on a case study for the continental United\nStates, considering different configurations in terms of spatial resolutions\nand representative periods. The performance is assessed with both the\ncommercial solver Gurobi and the open-source solver HiGHS. Results show that\nthe developed compact formulation consistently outperforms the other methods in\nterms of both runtime (30%-70% faster than other methods) and memory usage\n(1%-9% lower than other methods).",

    "abstract": "Speech pathology has impacts on communication abilities and quality of life.\nWhile deep learning-based models have shown potential in diagnosing these\ndisorders, the use of sensitive data raises critical privacy concerns. Although\ndifferential privacy (DP) has been explored in the medical imaging domain, its\napplication in pathological speech analysis remains largely unexplored despite\nthe equally critical privacy concerns. To the best of our knowledge, this study\nis the first to investigate DP's impact on pathological speech data, focusing\non the trade-offs between privacy, diagnostic accuracy, and fairness. Using a\nlarge, real-world dataset of 200 hours of recordings from 2,839 German-speaking\nparticipants, we observed a maximum accuracy reduction of 3.85% when training\nwith DP with high privacy levels. To highlight real-world privacy risks, we\ndemonstrated the vulnerability of non-private models to gradient inversion\nattacks, reconstructing identifiable speech samples and showcasing DP's\neffectiveness in mitigating these risks. To explore the potential\ngeneralizability across languages and disorders, we validated our approach on a\ndataset of Spanish-speaking Parkinson's disease patients, leveraging pretrained\nmodels from healthy English-speaking datasets, and demonstrated that careful\npretraining on large-scale task-specific datasets can maintain favorable\naccuracy under DP constraints. A comprehensive fairness analysis revealed\nminimal gender bias at reasonable privacy levels but underscored the need for\naddressing age-related disparities. Our results establish that DP can balance\nprivacy and utility in speech disorder detection, while highlighting unique\nchallenges in privacy-fairness trade-offs for speech data. This provides a\nfoundation for refining DP methodologies and improving fairness across diverse\npatient groups in real-world deployments.",

To mitigate this issue, we propose a reinforcement-based multi-source\nmeta-transfer learning framework (Meta-RTL) for low-resource commonsense\nreasoning.

For the purpose of this chapter, we define a\nfree-floating object as a solid body that is not orbited by a considerably more\nmassive body. A planet then is considered free floating if it is not orbiting a\nstar but it may be orbiting another planet. A binary planet, or planet-moon\npair that is not orbiting a star, is then considered free floating.\n  Most free-floating objects are not born as such because most objects form in\nsome sort of coordinated environmental effort, such as a star forming region or\na circum-stellar disk. Free-floating stars then originate from dissolved\nclusters. Free floating planets are ejected from their parent star in an\ninternal dynamical encounter with another planet or stripped from the star by\nother means such as a supernova or a nearby passing star. Free floating\n(interstellar) planetesimals probably form in a similar fashion as\nfree-floating planets.\n  The number of free-floating objects in the Galaxy can be large. With billions\nof stars and planets, and trillions of interstellar planetesimals. Although\nfree-floating planets appear to be quite common (a few hundred have been\nobserved), only two interstellar planetesimals have been discovered so far.

The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is\noften necessary to make this sensed data suitable for further processing\n$\\unicode{x2013}$ such as by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms\n$\\unicode{x2013}$ and for transmission over communication networks. Analog\nin-memory computing has been shown to be a fast and energy-efficient solution\nfor processing edge AI workloads, but not for Fourier transforms.

We experimentally demonstrate analog FFTs on 1D\naudio and 2D image signals, using a large-scale charge-trapping memory array\nwith precisely tunable, low-conductance analog states. The scalability of both\nthe new analog FFT approach and the charge-trapping memory device is leveraged\nto compute a 65,536-point analog DFT, a scale that is otherwise inaccessible by\nanalog systems and which is $>$1000$\\times$ larger than any previous analog DFT\ndemonstration.

In this Letter, we report the discovery of the\nsecond optical counterpart (AT2024gsa) to an FXT (EP240414a). EP240414a is\nlocated at a projected radial separation of 27 kpc from its likely host galaxy\nat $z = 0.4018 \\pm 0.0010$. The optical light curve of AT2024gsa displays three\ndistinct components. The initial decay from our first observation is followed\nby a re-brightening episode, displaying a rapid rise in luminosity to an\nabsolute magnitude of $M_r \\sim -21$ after two rest-frame days. While the early\noptical luminosity and decline rate is similar to luminous fast blue optical\ntransients, the colour temperature of AT2024gsa is distinctly red and we show\nthat the peak flux is inconsistent with a thermal origin. The third component\npeaks at $M_i \\sim -19$ at $\\gtrsim 16$ rest-frame days post-FXT, and is\ncompatible with an emerging supernova. We fit the $riz$-band data with a series\nof power laws and find that the decaying components are in agreement with\ngamma-ray burst afterglow models, and that the re-brightening may originate\nfrom refreshed shocks. By considering EP240414a in context with all previously\nreported known-redshift FXT events, we propose that Einstein Probe FXT\ndiscoveries may predominantly result from (high-redshift) gamma-ray bursts, and\nthus appear to be distinct from the previously discovered lower redshift, lower\nluminosity population of FXTs.",

To close this gap, we propose two metrics for localizing\nmemorization in SSL encoders on a per-layer (layermem) and per-unit basis\n(unitmem).

By\nlocalizing memorization in various encoder architectures (convolutional and\ntransformer-based) trained on diverse datasets with contrastive and\nnon-contrastive SSL frameworks, we find that (1) while SSL memorization\nincreases with layer depth, highly memorizing units are distributed across the\nentire encoder, (2) a significant fraction of units in SSL encoders experiences\nsurprisingly high memorization of individual data points, which is in contrast\nto models trained under supervision, (3) atypical (or outlier) data points\ncause much higher layer and unit memorization than standard data points, and\n(4) in vision transformers, most memorization happens in the fully-connected\nlayers. Finally, we show that localizing memorization in SSL has the potential\nto improve fine-tuning and to inform pruning strategies.",

We present an extensive catalog of the physical properties of more than\na million galaxies within the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), one\nof the largest spectroscopic surveys to date. Spanning over a full variety of\ntarget types, including emission line galaxies and luminous red galaxies as\nwell as quasars, our survey encompasses an unprecedented range of spectroscopic\nredshifts, stretching from 0 to 6.\n  Methods. The physical properties, such as stellar masses and star formation\nrates, are derived via the CIGALE spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting\ncode accounting for the contribution coming from active galactic nuclei (AGN).\nBased on the modeling of the optical-mid-infrared (grz complemented by WISE\nphotometry) SEDs, we study galaxy properties with respect to their location on\nthe main sequence.\n  Results. We revise the dependence of stellar mass estimates on model choices\nand availability of the WISE photometry. The WISE information is mandatory to\nminimize the misclassification of star-forming galaxies as AGN. The lack of\nWISE bands in SED fits leads to elevated AGN fractions for 68% of star-forming\ngalaxies identified using emission line diagnostic diagram but does not\nsignificantly affect their stellar mass nor star formation estimates.",

    "abstract": "Causal Graph Discovery (CGD) is the process of estimating the underlying\nprobabilistic graphical model that represents joint distribution of features of\na dataset. CGD-algorithms are broadly classified into two categories: (i)\nConstraint-based algorithms (outcome depends on conditional independence (CI)\ntests), (ii) Score-based algorithms (outcome depends on optimized\nscore-function). Since, sensitive features of observational data is prone to\nprivacy-leakage, Differential Privacy (DP) has been adopted to ensure user\nprivacy in CGD. Adding same amount of noise in this sequential-natured\nestimation process affects the predictive performance of the algorithms. As\ninitial CI tests in constraint-based algorithms and later iterations of the\noptimization process of score-based algorithms are crucial, they need to be\nmore accurate, less noisy. Based on this key observation, we present CURATE\n(CaUsal gRaph AdapTivE privacy), a DP-CGD framework with adaptive privacy\nbudgeting. In contrast to existing DP-CGD algorithms with uniform privacy\nbudgeting across all iterations, CURATE allows adaptive privacy budgeting by\nminimizing error probability (for constraint-based), maximizing iterations of\nthe optimization problem (for score-based) while keeping the cumulative leakage\nbounded. To validate our framework, we present a comprehensive set of\nexperiments on several datasets and show that CURATE achieves higher utility\ncompared to existing DP-CGD algorithms with less privacy-leakage.",

The design is similar to the S-I-S superconducting Josephson\njunction but functions with a completely different microscopic mechanism: two\nexciton condensates are spatially separated by a gated region that is nearly\nlayer-polarized, and the variation of layer pseudospin mediates a Josephson\ncoupling sufficiently strong to have an observable effect. The Josephson\ncoupling can be controlled by both the gate voltage and the magnetic field, and\nwe show our design's high range of tunability and experimental feasibility with\nrealistic parameters in vdW heterostructures.",

    "abstract": "Spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling is one of the main methods to\nestimate galaxy properties, such as photometric redshifts, $z$, and stellar\nmasses, $M_*$, for extragalactic imaging surveys. SEDs are currently modeled as\nlight from a composite stellar population attenuated by a uniform foreground\ndust screen, despite evidence from simulations and observations that find large\nspatial variations in dust attenuation due to the detailed geometry of stars\nand gas within galaxies. In this work, we examine the impact of this simplistic\ndust assumption on inferred $z$ and $M_*$ for Rubin LSST. We first construct\nsynthetic LSST-like observations ($ugrizy$ magnitudes) from the NIHAO-SKIRT\ncatalog, which provides SEDs from high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations\nusing 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer. We then infer $z$ and $M_*$ from the\nsynthetic observations using the PROVABGS Bayesian SED modeling framework.\nOverall, the uniform dust screen assumption biases both $z$ and $M_*$ in\ngalaxies, consistently and significantly for galaxies with dust attenuation\n$A_V \\gtrsim 0.5$, and likely below. The biases depend on the orientation in\nwhich the galaxies are observed. At $z=0.4$, $z$ is overestimated by $\\sim$0.02\nfor face-on galaxies and $M_*$ is underestimated by $\\sim$0.4 dex for edge-on\ngalaxies. The bias in photo-$z$ is equivalent to the desired redshift precision\nlevel of LSST \"gold sample\" and will be larger at higher redshifts. Our results\nunderscore the need for SED models with additional flexibility in the dust\nparameterization to mitigate significant systematic biases in cosmological\nanalyses with LSST.",

    "abstract": "Detections of fast X-ray transients (FXTs) have been accrued over the last\nfew decades. However, their origin has remained mysterious. There is now rapid\nprogress thanks to timely discoveries and localisations with the Einstein Probe\nmission. Early results indicate that FXTs may frequently, but not always, be\nassociated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Here, we report on the\nmulti-wavelength counterpart of FXT EP240414a, which has no reported gamma-ray\ncounterpart. The transient is located 25.7~kpc in projection from a massive\ngalaxy at $z=0.40$. We perform comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic\nfollow-up. The optical light curve shows at least three distinct emission\nepisodes with timescales of $\\sim 1, 4$ and 15 days and peak absolute\nmagnitudes of $M_R \\sim -20$, $-21$, and $-19.5$, respectively. The optical\nspectrum at early times is extremely blue, inconsistent with afterglow\nemission. It may arise from the interaction of both jet and supernova shock\nwaves with the stellar envelope and a dense circumstellar medium, as has been\nsuggested for some Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs). At late times, the\nspectrum evolves to a broad-lined~Type~Ic supernova, similar to those seen in\ncollapsar long-GRBs. This implies that the progenitor of EP240414a is a massive\nstar creating a jet-forming supernova inside a dense envelope, resulting in an\nX-ray outburst with a luminosity of $\\sim 10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and the\ncomplex observed optical/IR light curves. If correct, this argues for a causal\nlink between the progenitors of long-GRBs, FXTs and LFBOTs.",

Despite considerable work\ninvestigating QSHI edge states, there is still an open question about their\nresilience to large magnetic fields and the implication of such resilience for\nthe formation of a quasi-1D topological superconducting state. In this work, we\ninvestigate the transport properties of helical edge states in a QSHI-SC\njunction formed by a InAs/GaSb (15nm/5nm) double quantum well and a\nsuperconducting tantalum (Ta) constriction. We observe a robust conductance\nplateau up to 2 T, signaling resilient edge state transport. Such resilience is\nconsistent with the Dirac point for the edge states being buried in the bulk\nvalence band. Using a modified Landauer-Buttiker analysis, we find that the\nconductance is consistent with 98% Andreev reflection probability owing to the\nhigh transparency of the InAs/GaSb-Ta interface. We further theoretically show\nthat a buried Dirac point does not affect the robustness of the quasi-1D\ntopological superconducting phase, and favors the hybridization of Majorana\nKramer pairs and fermionic modes in the QSHI resulting in extended MKP states,\nhighlighting the subtle role of buried Dirac points in probing MKPs.",

    "abstract": "Factorization theorems for single inclusive jet production play a crucial\nrole in the study of jets and their substructure. In the case of small radius\njets, the dynamics of the jet clustering can be factorized from both the hard\nproduction dynamics, and the dynamics of the low scale jet substructure\nmeasurement, and is described by a matching coefficient that can be computed in\nperturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). A proposed factorization formula\ndescribing this process has been previously presented in the literature, and is\nreferred to as the semi-inclusive, or fragmenting jets formalism. By performing\nan explicit two-loop calculation, we show the inconsistency of this\nfactorization formula, in agreement with another recent result in the\nliterature. Building on recent progress in the factorization of single\nlogarithmic observables, and the understanding of reciprocity, we then derive a\nnew all-order factorization theorem for inclusive jet production. Our\nfactorization involves a non-trivial convolution structure, that maintains the\nuniversality of the hard function from inclusive fragmentation. We perform an\nexplicit two-loop calculation of the jet function in both $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super\nYang-Mills (SYM), and for all color channels in QCD, finding exact agreement\nwith the structure derived from our renormalization group equations. In\naddition, we derive several new results, including an extension of our\nfactorization formula to jet substructure observables, a jet algorithm\ndefinition of a generating function for the energy correlators, and new results\nfor exclusive jet functions.

From NIRCam imaging\nin F090W, F150W, and F277W, we derive a SFH which shows early star formation\nfollowed by a pause subsequent to the epoch of reionization which is then later\nfollowed by a re-ignition of star formation. This is very similar to the SFHs\nfrom previous studies of other dwarf galaxies in the ``transition zone''\nbetween quenched very low-mass galaxies and the more massive galaxies which\nshow no evidence of the impact of reionization on their SFHs; this pattern is\nrarely produced in simulations of SFHs.

The extended pause in star formation\nfrom z~5-1 has important implications for the contribution of low-mass galaxies\nto the UV photon budget at intermediate redshifts.

Inspired by\nthe observations that the final prediction in vision transformers (ViTs) is\nonly based on a subset of most informative tokens, we take the novel step of\nenhancing the efficiency of SSM-based vision models through token-based\npruning. However, direct applications of existing token pruning techniques\ndesigned for ViTs fail to deliver good performance, even with extensive\nfine-tuning.

Despite their\nsuperior empirical performance, existing theoretical guarantees are often\nconstrained by stringent assumptions or suboptimal convergence rates. In this\npaper, we establish a fast convergence theory for the denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic model (DDPM), a widely used SDE-based sampler, under minimal\nassumptions. Our analysis shows that, provided $\\ell_{2}$-accurate estimates of\nthe score functions, the total variation distance between the target and\ngenerated distributions is upper bounded by $O(d/T)$ (ignoring logarithmic\nfactors), where $d$ is the data dimensionality and $T$ is the number of steps.\nThis result holds for any target distribution with finite first-order moment.\nMoreover, we show that with careful coefficient design, the convergence rate\nimproves to $O(k/T)$, where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target data\ndistribution. This highlights the ability of DDPM to automatically adapt to\nunknown low-dimensional structures, a common feature of natural image\ndistributions. These results are achieved through a novel set of analytical\ntools that provides a fine-grained characterization of how the error propagates\nat each step of the reverse process.",

This paper\nintroduces a new approach for classification tasks using Large Language Models\n(LLMs) in an explainable method. Unlike ML models, which rely heavily on data\ncleaning and feature engineering, this method streamlines the process using\nLLMs. This paper proposes a method called \"Language Model Learning (LML)\"\npowered by a new method called \"Data-Augmented Prediction (DAP).\" The\nclassification is performed by LLMs using a method similar to that used by\nhumans who manually explore and understand the data to decide classifications.\nIn the process of LML, a dataset is summarized and evaluated to determine the\nfeatures leading to each label the most. In the DAP process, the system uses\nthe data summary and a row of the testing dataset to automatically generate a\nquery to retrieve relevant rows from the dataset for context-aware\nclassification. LML and DAP unlock new possibilities in areas that require\nexplainable and context-aware decisions by ensuring satisfactory accuracy even\nwith complex data.

    "abstract": "Given the increasing scale of model sizes, novel training strategies like\ngradual stacking [Gong et al., 2019, Reddi et al., 2023] have garnered\ninterest. Stacking enables efficient training by gradually growing the depth of\na model in stages and using layers from a smaller model in an earlier stage to\ninitialize the next stage. Although efficient for training, the model biases\ninduced by such growing approaches are largely unexplored. In this work, we\nexamine this fundamental aspect of gradual stacking, going beyond its\nefficiency benefits. We propose a variant of gradual stacking called MIDAS that\ncan speed up language model training by up to 40%. Furthermore we discover an\nintriguing phenomenon: MIDAS is not only training-efficient but surprisingly\nalso has an inductive bias towards improving downstream tasks, especially tasks\nthat require reasoning abilities like reading comprehension and math problems,\ndespite having similar or slightly worse perplexity compared to baseline\ntraining. To further analyze this inductive bias, we construct reasoning\nprimitives -- simple synthetic tasks that are building blocks for reasoning --\nand find that a model pretrained with stacking is significantly better than\nstandard pretraining on these primitives, with and without fine-tuning. This\nprovides stronger and more robust evidence for this inductive bias towards\nreasoning. These findings of training efficiency and inductive bias towards\nreasoning are verified at 1B, 2B and 8B parameter language models. Finally, we\nconjecture the underlying reason for this inductive bias by exploring the\nconnection of stacking to looped models and provide strong supporting empirical\nanalysis.",

Here, we reduce the depth of these\nproperty estimation algorithms by developing Parallel Quantum Signal\nProcessing. Our algorithm parallelizes the computation of $\\text{tr} (P(\\rho))$\nover $k$ systems and reduces the query depth to $d/k$, thus enabling a family\nof time-space tradeoffs for QSP.

Frequency\ndomain manipulation is a powerful strategy for modifying data that has temporal\nand spatial coherence by utilizing frequency decomposition. This work\nintroduces Spectral Wavelet Dropout (SWD), a novel regularization method that\nincludes two variants: 1D-SWD and 2D-SWD.

    "abstract": "Stability in recurrent neural models poses a significant challenge,\nparticularly in developing biologically plausible neurodynamical models that\ncan be seamlessly trained. Traditional cortical circuit models are notoriously\ndifficult to train due to expansive nonlinearities in the dynamical system,\nleading to an optimization problem with nonlinear stability constraints that\nare difficult to impose. Conversely, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel in\ntasks involving sequential data but lack biological plausibility and\ninterpretability. In this work, we address these challenges by linking dynamic\ndivisive normalization (DN) to the stability of ORGaNICs, a biologically\nplausible recurrent cortical circuit model that dynamically achieves DN and\nthat has been shown to simulate a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena.\nBy using the indirect method of Lyapunov, we prove the remarkable property of\nunconditional local stability for an arbitrary-dimensional ORGaNICs circuit\nwhen the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We thus connect ORGaNICs to a\nsystem of coupled damped harmonic oscillators, which enables us to derive the\ncircuit's energy function, providing a normative principle of what the circuit,\nand individual neurons, aim to accomplish. Further, for a generic recurrent\nweight matrix, we prove the stability of the 2D model and demonstrate\nempirically that stability holds in higher dimensions. Finally, we show that\nORGaNICs can be trained by backpropagation through time without gradient\nclipping/scaling, thanks to its intrinsic stability property and adaptive time\nconstants, which address the problems of exploding, vanishing, and oscillating\ngradients. By evaluating the model's performance on RNN benchmarks, we find\nthat ORGaNICs outperform alternative neurodynamical models on static image\nclassification tasks and perform comparably to LSTMs on sequential tasks.",

However, when required to generate\nresponses of a specific length, large language models often struggle to meet\nusers' needs due to their inherent difficulty in accurately perceiving\nnumerical constraints. To explore the ability of large language models to\ncontrol the length of generated responses, we propose the Target Length\nGeneration Task (TLG) and design two metrics, Precise Match (PM) and Flexible\nMatch (FM) to evaluate the model's performance in adhering to specified\nresponse lengths. Furthermore, we introduce a novel, model-agnostic approach\ncalled Ruler, which employs Meta Length Tokens (MLTs) to enhance the\ninstruction-following ability of large language models under length-constrained\ninstructions. Specifically, Ruler equips LLMs with the ability to generate\nresponses of a specified length based on length constraints within the\ninstructions. Moreover, Ruler can automatically generate appropriate MLT when\nlength constraints are not explicitly provided, demonstrating excellent\nversatility and generalization. Comprehensive experiments show the\neffectiveness of Ruler across different LLMs on Target Length Generation Task,\ne.g., at All Level 27.97 average gain on PM, 29.57 average gain on FM.

Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulation model\ncalibrated by the optical and ultraviolet observations of SN 2023ixf, we find\nthat the CRs cannot be accelerated in the early phase because the sharp\nvelocity jump at the shock disappears due to strong radiation pressure. Roughly\n4 days after the explosion, the collisionless sub-shock is formed in the CSM,\nwhich enables the CR production and leads to gamma-ray and neutrino emissions.\nThe shock sweeps up the entire dense CSM roughly 9 days after the explosion,\nwhich ceases the high-energy radiation.

Valuable information on vdW materials' interlayer\ninteractions is present in their low-frequency rigid-layer phonon spectra,\nwhich are experimentally accessible by terahertz spectroscopy techniques. In\nthis work, we have used polarization-sensitive terahertz time-domain\nspectroscopy to investigate a bulk sample of the naturally abundant, large\nbandgap vdW mineral clinochlore. We observed a strong and sharp anisotropic\nresonance in the complex refractive index spectrum near 1.13 THz, consistent\nwith our density functional theory predictions for shear modes. Polarimetry\nanalysis revealed that the shear phonon anisotropy reshapes the polarization\nstate of transmitted THz waves, inducing Faraday rotation and ellipticity.\nFurthermore, we used Jones formalism to discuss clinochlore phononic symmetries\nand describe our observations in terms of its eigenstates of polarization.\nThese results highlight the potential of exploring vdW minerals as central\nbuilding blocks for vdW heterostructures with compelling technological\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Images captured in challenging environments--such as nighttime, smoke, rainy\nweather, and underwater--often suffer from significant degradation, resulting\nin a substantial loss of visual quality. The effective restoration of these\ndegraded images is critical for the subsequent vision tasks. While many\nexisting approaches have successfully incorporated specific priors for\nindividual tasks, these tailored solutions limit their applicability to other\ndegradations. In this work, we propose a universal network architecture, dubbed\n``ReviveDiff'', which can address various degradations and bring images back to\nlife by enhancing and restoring their quality. Our approach is inspired by the\nobservation that, unlike degradation caused by movement or electronic issues,\nquality degradation under adverse conditions primarily stems from natural media\n(such as fog, water, and low luminance), which generally preserves the original\nstructures of objects. To restore the quality of such images, we leveraged the\nlatest advancements in diffusion models and developed ReviveDiff to restore\nimage quality from both macro and micro levels across some key factors\ndetermining image quality, such as sharpness, distortion, noise level, dynamic\nrange, and color accuracy. We rigorously evaluated ReviveDiff on seven\nbenchmark datasets covering five types of degrading conditions: Rainy,\nUnderwater, Low-light, Smoke, and Nighttime Hazy. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that ReviveDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both\nquantitatively and visually.",

BPI\nestimates the power consumption of individual cores and models the thermal\nbehavior of an SoC using only thermal sensor data and total power measurements.\nThe proposed ICBPI approach refines BPI's initialization process, particularly\nimproving the non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) step, which is critical\nto the accuracy of BPI. ICBPI introduces density-based spatial clustering of\napplications with noise (DBSCAN) to better align temperature and power\nconsumption data, thereby providing more accurate power consumption estimates.\nWe validate the ICBPI method through two key tasks. The first task evaluates\npower estimation accuracy across four different multicore architectures,\nincluding a heterogeneous processor. Results show that ICBPI significantly\nenhances accuracy, reducing error rates by 77.56% compared to the original BPI\nand by 68.44% compared to the state-of-the-art BPISS method.

The coupling between\n$Q$ and $L_m$ leads to the non-conservation of the matter energy-momentum\ntensor. We first investigated a cosmological model defined by the functional\nform $f(Q, L_m) = \\alpha Q + \\beta L_m^n$, where $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $n$ are\nconstants. The derived Hubble parameter $H(z) = H_0 (1+z)^{\\frac{3n}{2(2n-1)}}$\nindicates that $n$ significantly influences the scaling of $H(z)$ over cosmic\nhistory, with $n > 2$ suggesting accelerated expansion.

    "abstract": "Warm dark matter has been strongly constrained in recent years as the sole\ncomponent of dark matter. However, a less-explored alternative is that dark\nmatter consists of a mixture of warm and cold dark matter (MWDM). In this work,\nwe use observations of Milky Way satellite galaxies to constrain MWDM scenarios\nwhere the formation of small-scale structure is suppressed either by generic\nthermal relic warm dark matter or a sterile neutrino produced through the\nShi-Fuller mechanism. To achieve this, we model satellite galaxies by combining\nnumerical simulations with semi-analytical models for the subhalo population,\nand use a galaxy--halo connection model to match galaxies onto dark matter\nsubhalos. By comparing the number of satellites predicted by MWDM models to the\nobserved satellite population from the Dark Energy Survey and Pan-STARRS1, we\nconstrain the fraction of warm dark matter, $f_{\\rm WDM}$, as a function of its\nmass, $m_{\\rm WDM}$. We exclude dark matter being composed entirely of thermal\nrelic warm dark matter with $m_{\\rm WDM} \\leq 6.6 $ keV at a posterior ratio of\n10:1, consistent with previous works. However, we find that warm dark matter\nwith smaller mass is allowed when mixed with cold dark matter, and that the\n$f_{\\rm WDM}$ constraints strengthen with decreasing $m_{\\rm WDM}$ until they\nplateau at $f_{\\rm WDM} \\lesssim 0.45 $ for $m_{\\rm WDM} \\lesssim 1.5$ keV.\nLikewise, in the case of a sterile neutrino with mass of 7 keV produced through\nthe Shi-Fuller mechanism, we exclude a fraction of $f_{\\nu_s} \\lesssim 0.45$,\nindependent of mixing angle.

At best, this approach\nleads to computational inefficiency, and at worst to invalid inference. That\nbeing said, a number of approaches in the literature have been proposed to\nadaptively guide analysts in choosing the number of Monte-Carlo samples, by\nsequentially deciding when to stop collecting samples and draw inference. These\nworks introduce varying competing notions of what constitutes \"valid\"\ninference, complicating the landscape for analysts seeking suitable\nmethodology.

    "abstract": "Learning a discriminative model to distinguish a target from its surrounding\ndistractors is essential to generic visual object tracking. Dynamic target\nrepresentation adaptation against distractors is challenging due to the limited\ndiscriminative capabilities of prevailing trackers. We present a new visual\nPrompting mechanism for generic Visual Object Tracking (PiVOT) to address this\nissue. PiVOT proposes a prompt generation network with the pre-trained\nfoundation model CLIP to automatically generate and refine visual prompts,\nenabling the transfer of foundation model knowledge for tracking. While CLIP\noffers broad category-level knowledge, the tracker, trained on\ninstance-specific data, excels at recognizing unique object instances. Thus,\nPiVOT first compiles a visual prompt highlighting potential target locations.\nTo transfer the knowledge of CLIP to the tracker, PiVOT leverages CLIP to\nrefine the visual prompt based on the similarities between candidate objects\nand the reference templates across potential targets. Once the visual prompt is\nrefined, it can better highlight potential target locations, thereby reducing\nirrelevant prompt information. With the proposed prompting mechanism, the\ntracker can generate improved instance-aware feature maps through the guidance\nof the visual prompt, thus effectively reducing distractors. The proposed\nmethod does not involve CLIP during training, thereby keeping the same training\ncomplexity and preserving the generalization capability of the pretrained\nfoundation model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks indicate\nthat PiVOT, using the proposed prompting method can suppress distracting\nobjects and enhance the tracker.",

Although design of the\nreinforcing phase network offers tailorable control over both the global\nmechanical properties, like stiffness and strength, and the local properties,\nlike fracture nucleation and propagation, the fracture properties of irregular\nNRC's has not yet been fully characterized. This is because both the irregular\nreinforcing structure and choice of matrix phase material significantly affect\nthe fracture response, often resulting in diffuse damage, associated with\nmultiple crack nucleation locations. Here, we propose irregular polymer NRC's\nwhose matrix phase has a similar stiffness but half the strength of the\nreinforcing phase, which allows the structure of the reinforcing phase to\ncontrol the fracture response, while still forming and maintaining a primary\ncrack. Across a range of network coordination numbers, we obtain J-integral and\nR-curve measurements, and we determine that low coordination polymer NRC's\nprimarily dissipate fracture energy through plastic zone formation, while high\ncoordination polymer NRC's primarily dissipate energy through crack extension.\nFinally, we determine that there are two critical length scales to characterize\nand tailor the fracture response of the composites across the coordination\nnumbers: (i) the size of the plastic zone, and (ii) the size and geometry of\nthe structural features, defined as the areas enclosed by the reinforcing\nnetwork.",

    "abstract": "The effective dynamics of loop quantum gravity for marginally bound\nLema\\^itre-Tolman-Bondi spacetimes predict that the big-bang singularity is\nresolved and replaced by a cosmic bounce. Numerics show that these effective\ndynamics also homogenize small regions soon after the bounce when\ninhomogeneities before the bounce are sufficiently large. These homogeneous\nregions typically have a width of a few Planck lengths where relative\nperturbations in the energy density remain less than 15%. If the bounce is\nfollowed by an inflationary period, the homogeneous region can reach cosmic\nscales and the amplitude of relative perturbations can be suppressed to a value\ncompatible with observations.",

    "abstract": "One of the most captivating properties of polaritons is their capacity to\nconfine light at the nanoscale. This confinement is even more extreme in\ntwo-dimensional (2D) materials. 2D polaritons have been investigated by optical\nmeasurements using an external photodetector. However, their effective\nspectrally resolved electrical detection via far-field excitation remains\nunexplored. This fact hinders their potential exploitation in crucial\napplications such as sensing molecules and gases, hyperspectral imaging and\noptical spectrometry, banking on their potential for integration with silicon\ntechnologies. Herein, we present the first electrical spectroscopy of\npolaritonic nanoresonators based on a high-quality 2D-material heterostructure,\nwhich serves at the same time as the photodetector and the polaritonic\nplatform. We employ metallic nanorods to create hybrid nanoresonators within\nthe hybrid plasmon-phonon polaritonic medium in the mid and long-wave infrared\nranges. Subsequently, we electrically detect these resonators by near-field\ncoupling to a graphene pn-junction. The nanoresonators simultaneously present a\nrecord of lateral confinement and high-quality factors of up to 200, exhibiting\nprominent peaks in the photocurrent spectrum, particularly at the underexplored\nlower reststrahlen band of hBN. We exploit the geometrical and gate tunability\nof these nanoresonators to investigate their impact on the photocurrent\nspectrum and the polaritonic's waveguided modes. This work opens a venue for\nstudying this highly tunable and complex hybrid system, as well as for using it\nin compact platforms for sensing and photodetection applications.",

Given the\ncritical importance of accurately forecasting extreme weather, this study\nintroduces a comprehensive dataset that incorporates high-resolution extreme\nweather cases derived from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) data, a\n3-km real-time dataset provided by NOAA.\n  We also evaluate the current state-of-the-art deep learning models and\nNumerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems on HR-Extreme, and provide a\nimproved baseline deep learning model called HR-Heim which has superior\nperformance on both general loss and HR-Extreme compared to others. Our results\nreveal that the errors of extreme weather cases are significantly larger than\noverall forecast error, highlighting them as an crucial source of loss in\nweather prediction.

    "abstract": "We present cosmological parameter forecasts for the Euclid 6x2pt statistics,\nwhich include the galaxy clustering and weak lensing main probes together with\npreviously neglected cross-covariance and cross-correlation signals between\nimaging/photometric and spectroscopic data. The aim is understanding the impact\nof such terms on the Euclid performance. We produce 6x2pt cosmological\nforecasts, considering two different techniques: the so-called harmonic and\nhybrid approaches, respectively. In the first, we treat all the different\nEuclid probes in the same way, i.e. we consider only angular 2pt-statistics for\nspectroscopic and photometric clustering, as well as for weak lensing,\nanalysing all their possible cross-covariances and cross-correlations in the\nspherical harmonic domain. In the second, we do not account for negligible\ncross-covariances between the 3D and 2D data, but consider the combination of\ntheir cross-correlation with the auto-correlation signals. We find that both\ncross-covariances and cross-correlation signals, have a negligible impact on\nthe cosmological parameter constraints and, therefore, on the Euclid\nperformance. In the case of the hybrid approach, we attribute this result to\nthe effect of the cross-correlation between weak lensing and photometric data,\nwhich is dominant with respect to other cross-correlation signals. In the case\nof the 2D harmonic approach, we attribute this result to two main theoretical\nlimitations of the 2D projected statistics implemented in this work according\nto the analysis of official Euclid forecasts: the high shot noise and the\nlimited redshift range of the spectroscopic sample, together with the loss of\nradial information from subleading terms such as redshift-space distortions and\nlensing magnification. Our analysis suggests that 2D and 3D Euclid data can be\nsafely treated as independent, with a great saving in computational resources.",

This study\naims to identify explainable artifacts generated by state-of-the-art generative\nmodels (e.g., Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models) and\nleverage them for open-set identification and source attribution (i.e.,\npointing to the model that created the image).",

    "abstract": "Instabilities and avalanches in granular flows represent hallmarks of\nfailure: they can both disrupt industrial process flows and signal dangerous\nconditions, like those in grain silos and snowy mountaintops. We investigate\nintermittency and avalanches in the gravity-driven flow of granular materials\nthrough a quasi-2D hopper. Mixtures of rigid polypropylene and soft\npolyacrylamide particles flow through a hopper constriction. A combination of\nhigh-speed imaging, particle identification and tracking analyses enable us to\nmeasure quantities including particle velocities, outflow rates, the time\nintervals between consecutive particle exits, and the geometric properties of\nany temporary arches that form during a flow test. As the fraction of rigid\nparticles increases in the mixture, the velocity of exiting particles\nincreases. So too, however, does the probability of complete clogging. While\nsoft particles exhibit slower velocities at the hopper exit, they also\nfacilitate greater overall discharge rates. Simultaneously, the presence of\nsoft particles induces both intermittency and avalanches in the flow. In this\ncase, arches that could permanently block the flow are more likely to be\ntemporary in nature. Interestingly, the identity of the particle that falls\nfirst from a temporary arch correlates linearly with the mixing fraction in the\noverall sample. That is, soft particles, despite their correlation with flow\ninstabilities, are not significantly more likely to fall first from a temporary\narch. Investigating the arch geometries suggests that the particle forming the\nlargest bond angle with its neighbors is the one that causes an arch to fail,\nregardless of being soft or rigid.",

However, the currently-used benchmark dataset for NPPs does\nnot represent an up-to-date challenge in the seismological community since it\nlacks a key earthquake sequence from the region and improperly splits training\nand testing data. Furthermore, initial earthquake forecast benchmarking lacks a\ncomparison to state-of-the-art earthquake forecasting models typically used by\nthe seismological community. To address these gaps, we introduce EarthquakeNPP:\na collection of benchmark datasets to facilitate testing of NPPs on earthquake\ndata, accompanied by a credible implementation of the ETAS model. The datasets\ncover a range of small to large target regions within California, dating from\n1971 to 2021, and include different methodologies for dataset generation. In a\nbenchmarking experiment, we compare three spatio-temporal NPPs against ETAS and\nfind that none outperform ETAS in either spatial or temporal log-likelihood.\nThese results indicate that current NPP implementations are not yet suitable\nfor practical earthquake forecasting.

The first\nvelocity model is stationary and is based solely on $V_{S30}$; the second\nvelocity model is spatially varying and has location-specific adjustments. They\nwere developed using a dataset of 200 measured $V_S$ profiles. Both models were\nformulated within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, using a parameterization\nthat ensures robust scaling. The spatially varying model includes a slope\nadjustment term modeled as a Gaussian process to capture site-specific effects\nbased on location. Residual analysis shows that both models are unbiased for\n$V_S$ values up to 1000 m/sec. Along-depth variability models were also\ndeveloped using within-profile residuals. The proposed models show higher $V_S$\nin the San Jose area and Livermore Valley compared to the USGS Bay Area\ncommunity velocity model by a factor of two or more in some cases.\nGoodness-of-fit (GOF) comparisons using one-dimensional linear site-response\nanalysis at selected sites demonstrate that the proposed models outperform the\nUSGS model in capturing near-surface amplification across a broad frequency\nrange. Incorporating along-depth variability further improves the GOF scores by\nreducing over-amplification at high frequencies.

Common strategies monitor\nspecific parameters, tailored ad hoc to describe certain systems, over time.\nHowever, such approaches typically require prior knowledge of the underpinning\nphysics and are poorly transferable to different systems.

We employ a Cox process-based rate-state model,\nintegrating pore pressure data from NAM's dynamic reservoir model.

Unfortunately, however, there is currently no consensus\non when any of these combinations may be most reliably employed and how they\ngenerally compare. In this work, we conduct a large-scale study comparing CIs\nfor the generalization error, the first one of such size, where we empirically\nevaluate 13 different CI methods on a total of 19 tabular regression and\nclassification problems, using seven different inducers and a total of eight\nloss functions. We give an overview of the methodological foundations and\ninherent challenges of constructing CIs for the generalization error and\nprovide a concise review of all 13 methods in a unified framework. Finally, the\nCI methods are evaluated in terms of their relative coverage frequency, width,\nand runtime. Based on these findings, we can identify a subset of methods that\nwe would recommend.

The increase\nin diversity towards low mass galaxies is seen as an increase in the scatter of\nscaling relations such as the stellar mass-size and the baryonic Tully-Fisher\nrelation (BTFR), and is also demonstrated by recent in-depth studies of an\nextreme subclass of dwarf galaxies of low surface brightness, but large\nphysical sizes, called ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). Aims. We select galaxies\nfrom the Apertif HI survey, and apply a constraint on their i-band absolute\nmagnitude to exclude high mass systems. The sample consists of 24 galaxies, and\nspan HI mass ranges of 8.6 < log ($M_{HI}/M_{Sun}$) < 9.7 and stellar mass\nrange of 8.0 < log ($M_*/M_{Sun}$) < 9.7 (with only three galaxies having log\n($M_*/M_{Sun}$) > 9). Methods. We determine the geometrical parameters of the\nHI and stellar discs, build kinematic models from the HI data using 3DBarolo,\nand extract surface brightness profiles in g-, r- and i-band from the\nPan-STARRS 1 photometric survey. Results. We find that, at fixed stellar mass,\nour HI selected dwarfs have larger optical effective radii than isolated,\noptically-selected dwarfs from the literature. We find misalignments between\nthe optical and HI morphologies for some of our sample. For most of our\ngalaxies, we use the HI morphology to determine their kinematics, and we stress\nthat deep optical observations are needed to trace the underlying stellar\ndiscs. Standard dwarfs in our sample follow the same BTFR of high-mass\ngalaxies, whereas UDGs are slightly offset towards lower rotational velocities,\nin qualitative agreement with results from previous studies. Finally, our\nsample features a fraction (25%) of dwarf galaxies in pairs that is\nsignificantly larger with respect to previous estimates based on optical\nspectroscopic data.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce and study the Facility Location Problem with\nAleatory Agents (FLPAA), where the facility accommodates n agents larger than\nthe number of agents reporting their preferences, namely n_r. The spare\ncapacity is used by n_u=n-n_r aleatory agents sampled from a probability\ndistribution \\mu. The goal of FLPAA is to find a location that minimizes the\nex-ante social cost, which is the expected cost of the n_u agents sampled from\n\\mu plus the cost incurred by the agents reporting their position. We\ninvestigate the mechanism design aspects of the FLPAA under the assumption that\nthe Mechanism Designer (MD) lacks knowledge of the distribution $\\mu$ but can\nquery k quantiles of \\mu. We explore the trade-off between acquiring more\ninsights into the probability distribution and designing a better-performing\nmechanism, which we describe through the strong approximation ratio (SAR). The\nSAR of a mechanism measures the highest ratio between the cost of the\nmechanisms and the cost of the optimal solution on the worst-case input x and\nworst-case distribution \\mu, offering a metric for efficiency that does not\ndepend on \\mu. We divide our study into four different information settings:\nthe zero information case, in which the MD has access to no quantiles; the\nmedian information case, in which the MD has access to the median of \\mu; the\nn_u-quantile information case, in which the MD has access to n_u quantiles of\nits choice, and the k-quantile information case, in which the MD has access to\nk<n_u quantiles of its choice. For all frameworks, we propose a mechanism that\nis optimal or achieves a small constant SAR and pairs it with a lower bound on\nthe SAR. In most cases, the lower bound matches the upper bound, thus no\ntruthful mechanism can achieve a lower SAR. Lastly, we extend the FLPAA to\ninclude instances in which we must locate two facilities.",

Traditional RGB camera-based\neye-tracking systems often struggle with poor temporal resolution and\ncomputational constraints, limiting their effectiveness in capturing rapid eye\nmovements. To address these limitations, we propose EyeTrAES, a novel approach\nusing neuromorphic event cameras for high-fidelity tracking of natural\npupillary movement that shows significant kinematic variance. One of EyeTrAES's\nhighlights is the use of a novel adaptive windowing/slicing algorithm that\nensures just the right amount of descriptive asynchronous event data\naccumulation within an event frame, across a wide range of eye movement\npatterns. EyeTrAES then applies lightweight image processing functions over\naccumulated event frames from just a single eye to perform pupil segmentation\nand tracking. We show that these methods boost pupil tracking fidelity by 6+%,\nachieving IoU~=92%, while incurring at least 3x lower latency than competing\npure event-based eye tracking alternatives [38]. We additionally demonstrate\nthat the microscopic pupillary motion captured by EyeTrAES exhibits distinctive\nvariations across individuals and can thus serve as a biometric fingerprint.\nFor robust user authentication, we train a lightweight per-user Random Forest\nclassifier using a novel feature vector of short-term pupillary kinematics,\ncomprising a sliding window of pupil (location, velocity, acceleration)\ntriples. Experimental studies with two different datasets demonstrate that the\nEyeTrAES-based authentication technique can simultaneously achieve high\nauthentication accuracy (~=0.82) and low processing latency (~=12ms), and\nsignificantly outperform multiple state-of-the-art competitive baselines.",

    "abstract": "In the last years, kagome materials received massive attention by virtue of\nbeing candidate hosts for a large variety of quantum phases: spin liquids,\nunconventional superconductivity, and topological phases of matter, to name the\nmore exotic. One of the most interesting features is tunability: changing the\nfilling, the non-interacting band structure can be tuned from flat bands to\nconventional metallic phases as well as to semimetals. In this paper we\nconcentrate on the latter. At specific lattice filling the electronic bands\nhave a semimetallic structure, hosting Dirac, massless quasiparticles, like in\ngraphene or other layered two dimensional materials. Specifically, we determine\nwhat terms can be added to the nearest neighbor hopping that open at gap at\nsaid Dirac point. These terms can in principle arise through external\nperturbations, interactions or collective instabilities. We classify the\nsixteen possible gap-opening terms according to the broken symmetries.\nFurthermore, we identify concrete microscopic realisations allowing for an\ninterpretation of these phases.",

But such cooperative simultaneous\napplying summable and smooth functional spaces even more often occurs at\ninvestigations of nonlinear problems, where, in particular, some bootstrap\narguments are often involved. And we believe that the taking into account such\ninterpolation reasoning can notably simplify different bootstrap procedures to\nrise up the smoothness of a solution or obtain an a-priory estimate in smooth\nclasses of functions. Therefore by the present paper we just would like to\nattract the attention of the reader to such possibility.

    "abstract": "The operation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) faces challenges in\nfollowing predetermined waypoints due to coupled motions under environmental\ndisturbances. To address this, a 3D path following guidance and control system\nis developed in this work based on the line-of-sight (LOS) guidance method.\nConventionally, the 3D path following problem is transformed into heading and\ndepth control problems, assuming that the motion of the vehicle is decoupled in\nhorizontal and depth coordinates. The proposed control system design avoids\nthis simplifying assumption by transforming the problem into a 3D position and\norientation tracking problem. This design is achieved by computing a 2D\nhorizontal coordinate based on the desired heading and then computing a\ncorresponding LOS depth coordinate. A model predictive controller (MPC) is then\nimplemented using the 3D LOS coordinate and the computed orientation vector.\nThe MPC obtains a robust control by solving a minimax optimisation problem\nconsidering the effects of unknown ocean disturbances. The effectiveness of the\nproposed guidance and control system is demonstrated through the simulation of\na prototype AUV system. Numerical results show that the AUV can follow\npredetermined waypoints in the presence of time-varying disturbances, and the\nsystem is steered at a constant surge speed that is proportional to the radius\nof the circle of acceptance used to implement the guidance system.",

This does not exhibit a\nVainshtein mechanism in spherical symmetry, but one may still ask what happens\nfor spherical dynamics. We show that there are no regular time-dependent\nspherically symmetric solutions unless the matter has sufficiently large\npressure. For matter that does not satisfy this, such as non-relativistic\nmatter, any Cauchy slice of such a solution must necessarily have a point where\nthe metric becomes singular. Only a weak assumption on the asymptotics is made.\nWe then consider the next-to-minimal model. This has been argued to have a good\nVainshtein mechanism in spherical symmetry, and hence be phenomenologically\nviable, provided the relative sign of the minimal and next-to-minimal mass\nterms is the same, and we restrict attention to this case. We find that regular\nbehaviour requires the matter at the origin of symmetry to have positive\npressure -- in particular a massive scalar field fails to satisfy this\ncondition. Furthermore it restricts non-relativistic matter so that the\npressure is bounded from below in terms of the density and graviton mass in a\nmanner that is at odds with a reasonable phenomenology. This suggests that\nrealistic phenomenology will either require a resolution of singularities, or\nwill require dynamics beyond the non-generic setting of spherical symmetry.",

The masses of these companions are straddling the\n~13 Jupiter mass deuterium burning limit but their mass ratio with respect to\ntheir host star is close to that of Jupiter. We derive a frequency of such\nmassive planetary mass companions around B stars of 11-5+7%, accounting for the\nsurvey sensitivity. The discoveries of substellar companions bcen b and mu2sco\nB happened after only few stars in the survey had been observed, raising the\npossibility that massive Jovian planets might be common around B-stars. However\nour statistical analysis show that the occurrence rate of such planets is\nsimilar around B-stars and around solar-type stars of similar age, while B-star\ncompanions exhibit low mass ratios and larger semi-major axis.",

    "abstract": "Modern high performance computers are massively parallel; for many PDE\napplications spatial parallelism saturates long before the computer's\ncapability is reached. Parallel-in-time methods enable further speedup beyond\nspatial saturation by solving multiple timesteps simultaneously to expose\nadditional parallelism. ParaDiag is a particular approach to parallel-in-time\nbased on preconditioning the simultaneous timestep system with a perturbation\nthat allows block diagonalisation via a Fourier transform in time. In this\narticle, we introduce asQ, a new library for implementing ParaDiag\nparallel-in-time methods, with a focus on applications in the geosciences,\nespecially weather and climate. asQ is built on Firedrake, a library for the\nautomated solution of finite element models, and the PETSc library of scalable\nlinear and nonlinear solvers. This enables asQ to build ParaDiag solvers for\ngeneral finite element models and provide a range of solution strategies,\nmaking testing a wide array of problems straightforward. We use a quasi-Newton\nformulation that encompasses a range of ParaDiag methods, and expose building\nblocks for constructing more complex methods. The performance and flexibility\nof asQ is demonstrated on a hierarchy of linear and nonlinear atmospheric flow\nmodels. We show that ParaDiag can offer promising speedups and that asQ is a\nproductive testbed for further developing these methods.",

Here we treat both energy and\ntime as a resource, showing that, in the presence of noise, there is a\nnontrivial interplay between the average energy and the time devoted to the\nestimation. Our results are valid for the most general metrological schemes\n(e.g. adaptive schemes which may involve entanglement with external ancillae or\nany kind of continuous measurement). We apply recently derived precision bounds\nfor all parameters characterizing the paradigmatic case of a bosonic mode,\nsubject to Lindbladian noise. We show how the time employed in the estimation\nshould be partitioned in order to achieve the best possible precision. In most\ncases, the optimal performance may be obtained without the necessity of\nadaptivity or entanglement with ancilla. We compare results with classical\nstrategies.

It\nopened up a new field in pure mathematics and was utilised in the area of\nenumerative geometry. Spinor-Vector Duality (SVD) is an extension of mirror\nsymmetry. This can be readily understood in terms of the moduli of toroidal\ncompactification of the heterotic string, which include the metric the\nantisymmetric tensor field and the Wilson line moduli. In terms of toroidal\nmoduli, mirror symmetry corresponds to mappings of the internal space moduli,\nwhereas spinor-vector duality corresponds to maps of the Wilson line moduli. In\nthe past few of years, we demonstrated the existence of spinor-vector duality\nin the effective field theory compactifications of the string theories. This\nwas achieved by starting with a worldsheet orbifold construction that exhibited\nspinor-vector duality and resolving the orbifold singularities, hence\ngenerating a smooth effective field theory limit with an imprint of the\nspinor-vector duality. Just like mirror symmetry, the spinor-vector duality can\nbe used to study the properties of complex manifolds with vector bundles.\nSpinor--vector duality offers a top-down approach to the ``Swampland''-program,\nby exploring the imprint of the symmetries of the ultra-violet complete\nworldsheet string constructions in the effective field theory limit.

Our paper is\nmotivated by the following problem: When dealing with both asymptotic tracking\nand dynamic reference, we find that the control input is generally subject to\noverflow issues under a finite modulus, though the dynamic controller consists\nof only integer coefficients. First, we provide a new controller design method\nsuch that the coefficients of the tracking controller can be transformed into\nintegers leveraging the zooming-in factor of dynamic quantization.\n  By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we represent the control input as linear\ncombination of the previous control inputs. Leveraging the property above, we\ndesign an algorithm on the actuator side such that it can restore the control\ninput from the lower bits under a finite modulus. A lower bound of the modulus\nis also provided.\n  As an extension of the first result, we further solve the problem of\nunbounded internal state taking place in the actuator.

However, significant\ndisparities in model capacity and architectural design hinder the student's\ncomprehension of the complex knowledge imparted by the teacher, resulting in\nsub-optimal performance.

    "abstract": "Image denoising is a critical component in a camera's Image Signal Processing\n(ISP) pipeline. There are two typical ways to inject a denoiser into the ISP\npipeline: applying a denoiser directly to captured raw frames (raw domain) or\nto the ISP's output sRGB images (sRGB domain). However, both approaches have\ntheir limitations. Residual noise from raw-domain denoising can be amplified by\nthe subsequent ISP processing, and the sRGB domain struggles to handle\nspatially varying noise since it only sees noise distorted by the ISP.\nConsequently, most raw or sRGB domain denoising works only for specific noise\ndistributions and ISP configurations. To address these challenges, we propose\nDualDn, a novel learning-based dual-domain denoising. Unlike previous\nsingle-domain denoising, DualDn consists of two denoising networks: one in the\nraw domain and one in the sRGB domain. The raw domain denoising adapts to\nsensor-specific noise as well as spatially varying noise levels, while the sRGB\ndomain denoising adapts to ISP variations and removes residual noise amplified\nby the ISP. Both denoising networks are connected with a differentiable ISP,\nwhich is trained end-to-end and discarded during the inference stage. With this\ndesign, DualDn achieves greater generalizability compared to most\nlearning-based denoising methods, as it can adapt to different unseen noises,\nISP parameters, and even novel ISP pipelines. Experiments show that DualDn\nachieves state-of-the-art performance and can adapt to different denoising\narchitectures. Moreover, DualDn can be used as a plug-and-play denoising module\nwith real cameras without retraining, and still demonstrate better performance\nthan commercial on-camera denoising.

We develop this\nprocess by considering higher-order analogues of photoelasticity and\nelectrostriction than those used in conventional optomechanics, and examine how\nthe efficiency of this process can be made to exceed conventional\noptomechanical couplings.",

This\nidea is first illustrated in the quadratic Kitaev model, where different\npatterns for the Peierls phases are studied and their independent manipulation\nis seen to be able to drive the appearance of topological states and Majorana\nflat bands. We then consider a system with quartic interactions, namely an\nextended Bose-Hubbard (EBH) open chain with a finite Peierls phase associated\nwith the hopping terms. Focusing on the strong interactions limit of the\ntwo-body sector, we show the decisive influence of these phases on the two-band\nspectrum of the higher energy subspace, which behaves as an effective sawtooth\nchain with magnetic flux at each plaquette. In particular, both the width of\nthe energy gap between the two bands and the position of the in-gap edge states\ncan be controlled by the Peierls phase. Finally, by translating this\ntwo-particle one-dimensional (1D) system into a single-particle two-dimensional\n(2D) one, and subsequently mapping it onto an equivalent electrical LC circuit,\nwe identify a parameter set for which in-gap states are only present for\ncertain finite phase values.

    "abstract": "Modern central processing units (CPUs) feature single-instruction,\nmultiple-data pipelines to accelerate compute-intensive floating-point and\nfixed-point workloads. Traditionally, these pipelines and corresponding\ninstruction set architectures (ISAs) were designed for vector parallelism. In\nrecent years, major hardware vendors have further increased the throughput of\ntheir CPUs by introducing matrix units with corresponding ISA extensions. The\nScalable Matrix Extension (SME) has been announced for the Arm architecture in\n2021 and Apple's M4 chip is the first to support SME. This paper presents an\nin-depth study of SME on M4. Our microbenchmarks determine the maximum\nfloating-point and fixed-point throughput of M4's SME acceleration and study\nthe achievable bandwidth for transfers to and from the matrix registers.\nFurthermore, we used the insights gained to design a just-in-time code\ngenerator for SME-based small matrix multiplications. The results presented\nshow that M4's SME support is FP32-centric, with an achievable throughput of\nover 2.3 FP32 TFLOPS. To maximize read and write bandwidth, loading and storing\nto and from the matrix registers must be done in two steps. Our just-in-time\ngenerated small matrix multiplication kernels outperform the vendor-optimized\nBLAS implementation in almost all tested configurations.",

    "abstract": "Efficiently determining the satisfiability of a boolean equation -- known as\nthe SAT problem for brevity -- is crucial in various industrial problems.\nRecently, the advent of deep learning methods has introduced significant\npotential for enhancing SAT solving. However, a major barrier to the\nadvancement of this field has been the scarcity of large, realistic datasets.\nThe majority of current public datasets are either randomly generated or\nextremely limited, containing only a few examples from unrelated problem\nfamilies. These datasets are inadequate for meaningful training of deep\nlearning methods. In light of this, researchers have started exploring\ngenerative techniques to create data that more accurately reflect SAT problems\nencountered in practical situations. These methods have so far suffered from\neither the inability to produce challenging SAT problems or time-scalability\nobstacles. In this paper we address both by identifying and manipulating the\nkey contributors to a problem's ``hardness'', known as cores. Although some\nprevious work has addressed cores, the time costs are unacceptably high due to\nthe expense of traditional heuristic core detection techniques. We introduce a\nfast core detection procedure that uses a graph neural network. Our empirical\nresults demonstrate that we can efficiently generate problems that remain hard\nto solve and retain key attributes of the original example problems. We show\nvia experiment that the generated synthetic SAT problems can be used in a data\naugmentation setting to provide improved prediction of solver runtimes.",

In these cases, utilizing contacts to localize the\ntarget object can be effective. We propose an online planning framework using\nbinary contact signals for manipulation tasks with pose uncertainty, formulated\nas a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Naively representing\nthe belief as a particle set makes planning infeasible due to the large\nuncertainties in domestic settings, as identifying the best sequence of actions\nrequires rolling out thousands of actions across millions of particles, taking\nsignificant compute time. To address this, we propose a hierarchical belief\nrepresentation. Initially, we represent the uncertainty coarsely in a 3D\nvolumetric space. Policies that refine uncertainty in this space are computed\nand executed, and once uncertainty is sufficiently reduced, the problem is\ntranslated back into the particle space for further refinement before task\ncompletion. We utilize a closed-loop planning and execution framework with a\nheuristic-search-based anytime solver that computes partial policies within a\nlimited time budget. The performance of the framework is demonstrated both in\nreal world and in simulation on the high-precision task of inserting a plug\ninto a port using a UR10e manipulator, resolving positional uncertainties up to\n50 centimeters and angular uncertainties close to $2\\pi$.

Due to\ncomputational constraints, simulating the intricate details of galaxy formation\nand evolution relevant to IA across vast volumes is impractical. As an\nalternative, we propose a Deep Generative Model trained on the IllustrisTNG-100\nsimulation to sample 3D galaxy shapes and orientations to accurately reproduce\nintrinsic alignments along with correlated scalar features.

In this work, as a proof of concept, we propose a new\nframework that combines ontology with MLLMs to classify images of plant\ndiseases. Our method uses concepts about plant diseases from an existing\ndisease ontology to query MLLMs and extract relevant visual concepts from\nimages. Then, we use the reasoning capabilities of the ontology to classify the\ndisease according to the identified concepts. Ensuring that the model\naccurately uses the concepts describing the disease is crucial in\ndomain-specific applications. By employing an ontology, we can assist in\nverifying this alignment. Additionally, using the ontology's inference\ncapabilities increases transparency, explainability, and trust in the\ndecision-making process while serving as a judge by checking if the annotations\nof the concepts by MLLMs are aligned with those in the ontology and displaying\nthe rationales behind their errors.

    "abstract": "In a temporal forest each edge has an associated set of time labels that\nspecify the time instants in which the edges are available. A temporal path\nfrom vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ in the forest is a selection of a label for each\nedge in the unique path from $u$ to $v$, assuming it exists, such that the\nlabels selected for any two consecutive edges are non-decreasing.\n  We design linear-size data structures that maintain a temporal forest of\nrooted trees under addition and deletion of both edge labels and singleton\nvertices, insertion of root-to-node edges, and removal of edges with no labels.\nSuch data structures can answer temporal reachability, earliest arrival, and\nlatest departure queries. All queries and updates are handled in\npolylogarithmic worst-case time. Our results can be adapted to deal with\nlatencies. More precisely, all the worst-case time bounds are asymptotically\nunaffected when latencies are uniform. For arbitrary latencies, the update time\nbecomes amortized in the incremental case where only label additions and\nedge/singleton insertions are allowed as well as in the decremental case in\nwhich only label deletions and edge/singleton removals are allowed.\n  To the best of our knowledge, the only previously known data structure\nsupporting temporal reachability queries is due to Brito, Albertini, Casteigts,\nand Traven\\c{c}olo [Social Network Analysis and Mining, 2021], which can handle\ngeneral temporal graphs, answers queries in logarithmic time in the worst case,\nbut requires an amortized update time that is quadratic in the number of\nvertices, up to polylogarithmic factors.",

    "abstract": "Training deep learning models is a repetitive and resource-intensive process.\nData scientists often train several models before landing on a set of\nparameters (e.g., hyper-parameter tuning) and model architecture (e.g., neural\narchitecture search), among other things that yield the highest accuracy. The\ncomputational efficiency of these training tasks depends highly on how well the\ntraining data is supplied to the training process. The repetitive nature of\nthese tasks results in the same data processing pipelines running over and\nover, exacerbating the need for and costs of computational resources. In this\npaper, we present TensorSocket to reduce the computational needs of deep\nlearning training by enabling simultaneous training processes to share the same\ndata loader. TensorSocket mitigates CPU-side bottlenecks in cases where the\ncollocated training workloads have high throughput on GPU, but are held back by\nlower data-loading throughput on CPU. TensorSocket achieves this by reducing\nredundant computations and data duplication across collocated training\nprocesses and leveraging modern GPU-GPU interconnects. While doing so,\nTensorSocket is able to train and balance differently-sized models and serve\nmultiple batch sizes simultaneously and is hardware- and pipeline-agnostic in\nnature. Our evaluation shows that TensorSocket enables scenarios that are\ninfeasible without data sharing, increases training throughput by up to 100%,\nand when utilizing cloud instances, achieves cost savings of 50% by reducing\nthe hardware resource needs on the CPU side. Furthermore, TensorSocket\noutperforms the state-of-the-art solutions for shared data loading such as\nCoorDL and Joader; it is easier to deploy and maintain and either achieves\nhigher or matches their throughput while requiring fewer CPU resources.",

This paper captures the\nrelationships between frequently used objects and their static carriers. It\nconstructs an open-vocabulary Carrier-Relationship Scene Graph (CRSG) and\nupdates the carrying status during robot navigation to reflect the dynamic\nchanges of the scene. Based on the CRSG, we further propose an instance\nnavigation strategy that models the navigation process as a Markov Decision\nProcess. At each step, decisions are informed by Large Language Model's\ncommonsense knowledge and visual-language feature similarity. We designed a\nseries of long-sequence navigation tasks for frequently used everyday items in\nthe Habitat simulator.

    "abstract": "The success of learning-based coding techniques and the development of\nlearning-based image coding standards, such as JPEG-AI, point towards the\nadoption of such solutions in different fields, including the storage of\nbiometric data, like fingerprints. However, the peculiar nature of\nlearning-based compression artifacts poses several issues concerning their\nimpact and effectiveness on extracting biometric features and landmarks, e.g.,\nminutiae. This problem is utterly stressed by the fact that most models are\ntrained on natural color images, whose characteristics are very different from\nusual biometric images, e.g, fingerprint or iris pictures. As a matter of fact,\nthese issues are deemed to be accurately questioned and investigated, being\nsuch analysis still largely unexplored.\n  This study represents the first investigation about the adaptability of\nlearning-based image codecs in the storage of fingerprint images by measuring\nits impact on the extraction and characterization of minutiae. Experimental\nresults show that at a fixed rate point, learned solutions considerably\noutperform previous fingerprint coding standards, like JPEG2000, both in terms\nof distortion and minutiae preservation. Indeed, experimental results prove\nthat the peculiarities of learned compression artifacts do not prevent\nautomatic fingerprint identification (since minutiae types and locations are\nnot significantly altered), nor do compromise image quality for human visual\ninspection (as they gain in terms of BD rate and PSNR of 47.8% and +3.97dB\nrespectively).",

Yet, it is assumed in such tensor-based methods that\nthe spatial-blurring operation that creates the observed hyperspectral image\nfrom the desired super-resolved image is separable into independent horizontal\nand vertical blurring. Recent work has argued that such separable spatial\ndegradation is ill-equipped to model the operation of real sensors which may\nexhibit, for example, anisotropic blurring. To accommodate this fact, a\ngeneralized tensor formulation based on a Kronecker decomposition is proposed\nto handle any general spatial-degradation matrix, including those that are not\nseparable as previously assumed. Analysis of the generalized formulation\nreveals conditions under which exact recovery of the desired super-resolved\nimage is guaranteed, and a practical algorithm for such recovery, driven by a\nblockwise-group-sparsity regularization, is proposed.

This thesis develops an\nelectro-mechanical model to estimate electrostatic forces between human finger\nand touchscreen under EA and compares it to experimentally measured friction\nforces. The model aligns well with the data, showing that the electrostatic\nforce changes mainly due to charge leakage from the Stratum Corneum at\nfrequencies below 250 Hz and its electrical properties above 250 Hz.\nAdditionally, a novel approach using electrical impedance measurements\nestimates electrostatic forces by subtracting skin and touchscreen impedances\nfrom the total impedance. This method is the first to experimentally estimate\nthe average air gap between finger and voltage-induced capacitive touchscreen.\nThe effect of electrode polarization impedance, particularly at low\nfrequencies, was also studied, revealing its role in the charge leakage\nphenomenon. Tactile perception via EA was investigated using DC and AC voltage\nsignals on a touchscreen with 10 participants of varying finger moisture\nlevels. Results showed that AC voltage detection thresholds were significantly\nlower than for DC, explained by charge leakage at lower frequencies.\nParticipants with moist fingers exhibited higher threshold levels, supported by\nimpedance measurements. The thesis also investigated how touchscreen top\ncoatings influence tactile perception, focusing on EA-free interactions.\nPsychophysical experiments and physical measurements demonstrated that coating\nmaterials significantly affect tactile perception, likely due to molecular\ninteractions.

The approach uses two convolutional-neural-network\nbased models to learn keyness patterns from keyword datasets and overcomes\nannotation subjectivity by training the two models with bootstrap sampling\nstrategy. Experiments demonstrate that the approach not only achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on ten keyword datasets in general supervised\nkeyword extraction with an average top-10-F-measure of 0.316 , but also robust\ncross-domain performance with an average top-10-F-measure of 0.346 on four\ndatasets that are excluded in the training process. Such cross-domain\nrobustness is attributed to the fact that community-level keyness patterns are\nlimited in number and temperately independent of language domains, the\ndistinction between independent features and dependent features, and the\nsampling training strategy that balances excess risk and lack of negative\ntraining data.",

    "abstract": "Extending the well-studied concept of graphical regular representations to\nbipartite graphs, a Haar graphical representation (HGR) of a group $G$ is a\nbipartite graph whose automorphism group is isomorphic to $G$ and acts\nsemiregularly with the orbits giving the bipartition. The question of which\ngroups admit an HGR was inspired by a closely related question of Est\\'elyi and\nPisanski in 2016, as well as Babai's work in 1980 on poset representations, and\nhas been recently solved by Morris and Spiga. In this paper, we introduce the\n$m$-Haar graphical representation ($m$-HGR) as a natural generalization of HGR\nto $m$-partite graphs for $m\\geq2$, and explore the existence of $m$-HGRs for\nany fixed group. This inquiry represents a more robust version of the existence\nproblem of G$m$SRs as addressed by Du, Feng and Spiga in 2020. Our main result\nis a complete classification of finite groups $G$ without $m$-HGRs.",

The difficulty lies in the\ndiversity of action space: typically, a goal can be accomplished in multiple\nways, resulting in a multimodal action distribution for a single task. The\ncomplexity of action distribution escalates as the number of tasks increases.\nIn this work, we propose \\textbf{Discrete Policy}, a robot learning method for\ntraining universal agents capable of multi-task manipulation skills. Discrete\nPolicy employs vector quantization to map action sequences into a discrete\nlatent space, facilitating the learning of task-specific codes. These codes are\nthen reconstructed into the action space conditioned on observations and\nlanguage instruction. We evaluate our method on both simulation and multiple\nreal-world embodiments, including both single-arm and bimanual robot settings.\nWe demonstrate that our proposed Discrete Policy outperforms a well-established\nDiffusion Policy baseline and many state-of-the-art approaches, including ACT,\nOcto, and OpenVLA. For example, in a real-world multi-task training setting\nwith five tasks, Discrete Policy achieves an average success rate that is 26\\%\nhigher than Diffusion Policy and 15\\% higher than OpenVLA. As the number of\ntasks increases to 12, the performance gap between Discrete Policy and\nDiffusion Policy widens to 32.5\\%, further showcasing the advantages of our\napproach.

    "abstract": "Panoramic X-ray (PX) is a prevalent modality in dentistry practice owing to\nits wide availability and low cost. However, as a 2D projection of a 3D\nstructure, PX suffers from anatomical information loss and PX diagnosis is\nlimited compared to that with 3D imaging modalities. 2D-to-3D reconstruction\nmethods have been explored for the ability to synthesize the absent 3D\nanatomical information from 2D PX for use in PX image analysis. However, there\nare challenges in leveraging such 3D synthesized reconstructions. First,\ninferring 3D depth from 2D images remains a challenging task with limited\naccuracy. The second challenge is the joint analysis of 2D PX with its 3D\nsynthesized counterpart, with the aim to maximize the 2D-3D synergy while\nminimizing the errors arising from the synthesized image. In this study, we\npropose a new method termed 3DPX - PX image analysis guided by 2D-to-3D\nreconstruction, to overcome these challenges. 3DPX consists of (i) a novel\nprogressive reconstruction network to improve 2D-to-3D reconstruction and, (ii)\na contrastive-guided bidirectional multimodality alignment module for 3D-guided\n2D PX classification and segmentation tasks. The reconstruction network\nprogressively reconstructs 3D images with knowledge imposed on the intermediate\nreconstructions at multiple pyramid levels and incorporates Multilayer\nPerceptrons to improve semantic understanding. The downstream networks leverage\nthe reconstructed images as 3D anatomical guidance to the PX analysis through\nfeature alignment, which increases the 2D-3D synergy with bidirectional feature\nprojection and decease the impact of potential errors with contrastive\nguidance. Extensive experiments on two oral datasets involving 464 studies\ndemonstrate that 3DPX outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in various tasks\nincluding 2D-to-3D reconstruction, PX classification and lesion segmentation.",

Nevertheless, the microscopic\norigin of this effect is not understood, and there is an intensive discussion\nabout the manifestation of the magnetoresistance that is generated between a\nchiral system and a ferromagnet. Hanle spin precession measurements can\nunambiguously prove the injection and detection of a spin accumulation in a\nnon-magnetic material, as was shown with traditional ferromagnetic\ninjectors/detectors. Here, we analyze in detail the Hanle spin precession\ninduced magnetoresistance and find that it is inverted as compared to the\nferromagnetic case. We explicitly model the spin injection and detection by\nboth a chiral system and a ferromagnetic system, as well as the spin transport\nin a semiconductor, for a general set of (spin) transport parameters that cover\nthe relevant experimental regime. For all sets of parameters, we find that the\nHanle signals for a chiral system and ferromagnet are each others opposites.",

The spatial and temporal evolution\nof the non-neutralized electric current of the region as well as its\nconstituent sub-regions is examined.

Active region NOAA 13664\nwas formed by the emergence and interaction of three sub-regions, two of which\nwere of notable individual complexity. It consisted of numerous persistent,\ncurrent-carrying magnetic partitions that exhibited periods of conspicuous\nmotions and strongly increasing electric current at many locations within the\nregion.

In contrast, in the field of artificial\nintelligence, controllable generation methods like ControlNet heavily rely on\nannotated training datasets such as depth maps, semantic segmentation maps, and\nposes, which limits the method's scalability. Inspired by the neural mechanisms\nthat may contribute to the brain's associative power, specifically the cortical\nmodularization and hippocampal pattern completion, here we propose a\nself-supervised controllable generation (SCG) framework. Firstly, we introduce\nan equivariant constraint to promote inter-module independence and intra-module\ncorrelation in a modular autoencoder network, thereby achieving functional\nspecialization. Subsequently, based on these specialized modules, we employ a\nself-supervised pattern completion approach for controllable generation\ntraining. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed modular\nautoencoder effectively achieves functional specialization, including the\nmodular processing of color, brightness, and edge detection, and exhibits\nbrain-like features including orientation selectivity, color antagonism, and\ncenter-surround receptive fields. Through self-supervised training, associative\ngeneration capabilities spontaneously emerge in SCG, demonstrating excellent\ngeneralization ability to various tasks such as associative generation on\npainting, sketches, and ancient graffiti. Compared to the previous\nrepresentative method ControlNet, our proposed approach not only demonstrates\nsuperior robustness in more challenging high-noise scenarios but also possesses\nmore promising scalability potential due to its self-supervised manner.Codes\nare released on Github and Gitee.",

    "abstract": "A fault-tolerant approach to reliable quantum memory is essential for\nscalable quantum computing, as physical qubits are susceptible to noise.\nQuantum error correction (QEC) must be continuously performed to prolong the\nmemory lifetime. In QEC, error syndromes are generated rapidly, often within\nthe execution time of a few quantum gates, requiring decoders to process this\nerror data with equal speed. A typical QEC cycle involves multiple rounds of\nsyndrome measurements, causing potential error locations to scale rapidly with\nthe code size and the number of measurement rounds. However, no such decoders\ncurrently exist for general quantum low-density parity-check codes. In this\npaper, we propose a fault-tolerant belief propagation (FTBP) decoder that\nutilizes a space-time Tanner graph across multiple rounds of syndrome\nextraction with mixed-alphabet error variables. To enhance FTBP, we introduce a\ntechnique of probabilistic error consolidation to mitigate degeneracy effects\nand short cycles. Additionally, we propose an adaptive sliding window procedure\nthat captures long error events across window boundaries and adjusts the\ndecoding in real time. Our simulations demonstrate high error thresholds of\n0.4%-0.87% and strong error-floor performance for topological code families,\nincluding rotated toric, toric color, and twisted XZZX toric codes.",

In the present work, the probabilistic distribution of the\nlandslide detachment points within a valley is modelled as a spatial Poisson\npoint process, whose intensity depends on geophysical predictors according to a\ngeneralized additive model. Modelling the intensity with a generalized additive\nmodel jointly allows to obtain good predictive performance and to preserve the\ninterpretability of the effects of the geophysical predictors on the intensity\nof the process. We propose a novel workflow, based on Random Forests, to select\nthe geophysical predictors entering the model for the intensity. In this\ncontext, the statistically significant effects are interpreted as activating or\nstabilizing factors for landslide detachment. In order to guarantee the\ntransferability of the resulting model, training, validation, and test of the\nalgorithm are performed on mutually disjoint valleys in the Alps of Lombardy\n(Italy). Finally, the uncertainty around the estimated intensity of the process\nis quantified via semiparametric bootstrap.",

We develop this approach\non a generic formalism called layered Markov chain (LMC).

A combination (hereafter called SBC) of the SNe~Ia with baryon\nacoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument\n(DESI) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) recently indicated deviations\nfrom the standard interpretation of dark energy as a cosmological constant. In\nthis paper, we analyse various systematic uncertainties in the distance\nmeasurement of SNe~Ia and their impact on the inferred dark energy properties\nin the canonical Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model. We model systematic\neffects like photometric calibration, progenitor and dust evolution, and\nuncertainty in the galactic extinction law. We find that all the dominant\nsystematic errors shift the dark energy inference towards the DESI 2024 results\nfrom an underlying $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. A small change in the calibration,\nand change in the Milky Way dust, can give rise to systematic-driven shifts on\n$w_0$-$w_a$ constraints, comparable to the deviation reported from the DESI\n2024 results. We forecast that the systematic uncertainties can shift the\ninference of $w_0-w_a$ by a few times the error ellipse for future low- and\nhigh-$z$ SN~Ia compilations and hence, it is critical to circumvent them to\nrobustly test for deviations from $\\Lambda$.

First, we show that individuals are far more\nlikely to seek AI feedback in situations in which they experienced success\nrather than failure.

A range of elements from 4 X 4 to 50 X 50 planar layouts\nwere taken into consideration during the investigation. Increasing the number\nof elements improves the directivity. Increasing the number of elements in the\nplanar array resulted in a great improvement in directivity, as seen by the\ncomputed and simulated results. Consequently, by increasing the antenna's\ndirectivity, a greater number of elements influences the overall field emitted.",

The first pillar comprises two models: a simulation model and a\ncontrol-oriented model. The simulation model captures the intricate\nterramechanics dynamics arising from soil-track interaction and is employed to\ndevelop faithful digital twins of the system across a wide range of operating\nconditions.

We\naggregate skill strings into 48 clusters of general, occupation-specific, and\nmanagerial skills. Multidimensional skills can account for several important\nlabor-market patterns. First, the number and composition of skills are\nsystematically related to measures of human-capital investment such as\neducation and work experience. The number of skills increases with experience,\nand the average age-skill profile closely resembles the well-established\nconcave age-earnings profile. Second, workers who report more skills,\nespecially specific and managerial ones, hold higher-paid jobs. Skill\ndifferences account for more earnings variation than detailed measures of\neducation and experience. Third, we document a sizable gender gap in skills.\nWhile women and men report nearly equal numbers of skills shortly after college\ngraduation, women's skill count increases more slowly with age subsequently. A\nsimple quantitative exercise shows that women's slower skill accumulation can\nbe fully accounted for by reduced work hours associated with motherhood. The\nresulting gender differences in skills rationalize a substantial proportion of\nthe gender gap in job-based earnings.",

Despite its convenience,\nfingerprint authentication through fingerphotos is more vulnerable to\npresentation attacks, which has motivated recent research efforts towards\ndeveloping fingerphoto Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) techniques. However,\nprior PAD approaches utilized supervised learning methods that require labeled\ntraining data for both bona fide and attack samples. This can suffer from two\nkey issues, namely (i) generalization:the detection of novel presentation\nattack instruments (PAIs) unseen in the training data, and (ii) scalability:the\ncollection of a large dataset of attack samples using different PAIs. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised approach based on a\nstate-of-the-art deep-learning-based diffusion model, the Denoising Diffusion\nProbabilistic Model (DDPM), which is trained solely on bona fide samples. The\nproposed approach detects Presentation Attacks (PA) by calculating the\nreconstruction similarity between the input and output pairs of the DDPM. We\npresent extensive experiments across three PAI datasets to test the accuracy\nand generalization capability of our approach. The results show that the\nproposed DDPM-based PAD method achieves significantly better detection error\nrates on several PAI classes compared to other baseline unsupervised\napproaches.",

In practice it is not uncommon to obtain two topologically distinct\ntrees for the same set of species, and this motivates the use of distance\nmeasures to quantify dissimilarity. A well-known measure is the maximum\nagreement forest (MAF): a minimum-size partition of the leaf labels which\nsplits both trees into the same set of disjoint, leaf-labelled subtrees (up to\nisomorphism after suppressing degree-2 vertices). Computing such a MAF is\nNP-hard and so considerable effort has been invested in finding FPT algorithms,\nparameterised by $k$, the number of components of a MAF. The state of the art\nhas been unchanged since 2015, with running times of $O^*(3^k)$ for unrooted\ntrees and $O^*(2.3431^k)$ for rooted trees. In this work we present improved\nalgorithms for both the unrooted and rooted cases, with runtimes $O^*(2.846^k)$\nand $O^*(2.3391^k)$ respectively. The key to our improvement is a novel\nbranching strategy in which we show that any overlapping components obtained on\nthe way to a MAF can be `split' by a branching rule with favourable branching\nfactor, and then the problem can be decomposed into disjoint subproblems to be\nsolved separately.

Considering\nthe presence of these two issues, this paper targets the resolution of a class\nof nonconvex optimization problems under the Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz (P-{\\L})\ncondition. To address this problem, we first identify and construct the\nadversary system model. To enhance the robustness of stochastic gradient\ndescent methods, we mask the local gradients with Gaussian noises and adopt a\nresilient aggregation method self-centered clipping (SCC) to design a\ndifferentially private (DP) decentralized Byzantine-resilient algorithm, namely\nDP-SCC-PL, which simultaneously achieves differential privacy and Byzantine\nresilience. The convergence analysis of DP-SCC-PL is challenging since the\nconvergence error can be contributed jointly by privacy-preserving and\nByzantine-resilient mechanisms, as well as the nonconvex relaxation, which is\naddressed via seeking the contraction relationships among the disagreement\nmeasure of reliable agents before and after aggregation, together with the\noptimal gap. Theoretical results reveal that DP-SCC-PL achieves consensus among\nall reliable agents and sublinear (inexact) convergence with well-designed\nstep-sizes. It has also been proved that if there are no privacy issues and\nByzantine agents, then the asymptotic exact convergence can be recovered.\nNumerical experiments verify the utility, resilience, and differential privacy\nof DP-SCC-PL by tackling a nonconvex optimization problem satisfying the P-{\\L}\ncondition under various Byzantine attacks.",

The missions of\ninterest here, involve routing multiple UAVs visiting multiple targets,\nutilising sensors to capture data relating to each target. Finding such\nsolutions is often an NP-Hard problem and cannot be solved efficiently on\nclassical computers. Furthermore, during the mission new constraints and\nobjectives may arise, requiring a new solution to be computed within a short\ntime period. To achieve this we investigate near term quantum algorithms that\nhave the potential to offer speed-ups against current classical methods. We\ndemonstrate how a large family of these problems can be formulated as a Mixed\nInteger Linear Program (MILP) and then converted to a Quadratic Unconstrained\nBinary Optimisation (QUBO). The formulation provided is versatile and can be\nadapted for many different constraints with clear qubit scaling provided. We\ndiscuss the results of solving the QUBO formulation using commercial quantum\nannealers and compare the solutions to current edge classical solvers.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised learning methods have a soft inspiration in cognition models. To\nthis day, the most successful unsupervised learning methods revolve around\nclustering samples in a mathematical space. In this paper we propose a\nprimitive-based, unsupervised learning approach for decision-making inspired by\na novel cognition framework. This representation-centric approach models the\ninput space constructively as a distributed hierarchical structure in an\ninput-agnostic way. We compared our approach with both current state-of-the-art\nunsupervised learning classification, with current state-of-the-art small and\nincomplete datasets classification, and with current state-of-the-art cancer\ntype classification. We show how our proposal outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art. We also evaluate some cognition-like properties of our\nproposal where it not only outperforms the compared algorithms (even supervised\nlearning ones), but it also shows a different, more cognition-like, behaviour.",

Consequently, although Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate\nfluent text, they often introduce inaccuracies by hallucinating content not\nfound in the original source. While supervised fine-tuning methods that\nmaximize likelihood contribute to this issue, they do not consistently enhance\nthe faithfulness of the summaries. Preference-based optimization methods, such\nas Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), can further refine the model to align\nwith human preferences. However, these methods still heavily depend on costly\nhuman feedback. In this work, we introduce a novel and straightforward approach\ncalled Model-based Preference Optimization (MPO) to fine-tune LLMs for improved\nsummarization abilities without any human feedback. By leveraging the model's\ninherent summarization capabilities, we create a preference dataset that is\nfully generated by the model using different decoding strategies.

Numerical models are only partially successful at\nreproducing the orbital architecture of the inner planets, but have generally\nnot considered the effect of the growth of the giant planets. I dynamically\nmodel TPF as the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn are growing using GENGA. The\nevolution of the masses, radii and orbital elements of the gas giants are\nprecomputed and read and interpolated within GENGA. The terrestrial planets are\nformed by planetesimal accretion from tens of thousands of self-gravitating\nplanetesimals spread between 0.5 au and 8.5 au. The total mass of the inner\nplanetesimal disc and outer disc are typically 2 and 3 Earth masses\nrespectively, and the composition of the planetesimals changes from\nnon-carbonaceous-like to carbonaceous-like at a prescribed distance, ranging\nfrom 2 au to 5 au. After 5 Myr of evolution approximately 10% to 25% of the\nmass of planetesimals in the Jupiter-Saturn region is implanted in the inner\nsolar system, which is more than what cosmochemical models predict. The\nimplantation initially sets up a composition gradient in the inner solar\nsystem, with the fraction of outer solar system material increasing with\nincreasing distance to the Sun. The planetesimals that remain in the inner\nsolar system have a mixed composition. The growth of the gas giants scatters\nplanetesimals in their vicinity into the inner solar system, which changes the\nisotopic composition of the terrestrial planets. The planetesimal disc in the\nvicinity of the gas giants may not have been very massive, ~1 ME. The inner\nplanetesimal disc may not have extended much farther than 2 au otherwise\nembryos do not grow fast enough to produce Mars analogues.

This involves the formation of\nintermediate-mass seed BHs and their runaway mergers into super-massive BHs\nwith high BH-to-stellar mass ratios and low AGN luminosities. We present a\nscenario of merger-driven BH growth in FFB galaxies and study its feasibility.\nBH seeds form within the building blocks of the FFB galaxies, namely, thousands\nof compact star clusters, each starbursting in a free-fall time of a few Myr\nbefore the onset of stellar and supernova feedback. The BH seeds form by rapid\ncore collapse in the FFB clusters, in a few free-fall times, sped up by the\nmigration of massive stars due to the young, broad stellar mass function and\nstimulated by a `gravo-gyro' instability due to internal cluster rotation and\nflattening. BHs of $10^4 M_\\odot$ are expected in $10^6 M_\\odot$ FFB clusters\nwithin sub-kpc galactic disks at $z \\sim 10$. The BHs then migrate to the\ngalaxy center by dynamical friction, hastened by the compact FFB stellar\ngalactic disk configuration. Efficient mergers of the BH seeds will produce\n$10^{6-8} M_\\odot$ BHs with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio $\\sim 0.01$ by $z \\sim\n4-7$, as observed. The growth of the central BH by mergers can overcome the\nbottleneck introduced by gravitational wave recoils if the BHs inspiral within\na relatively cold disk or if the escape velocity from the galaxy is boosted by\na wet compaction event. Such events, common in massive galaxies at high\nredshifts, can also help by speeding up the inward BH migration and by\nproviding central gas to assist with the final parsec problem. The cold disk\nversion of the FFB scenario provides a feasible route for the formation of\nsupermassive BHs.",

    "abstract": "Recently, LiDAR segmentation methods for autonomous vehicles, powered by deep\nneural networks, have experienced steep growth in performance on classic\nbenchmarks, such as nuScenes and SemanticKITTI. However, there are still large\ngaps in performance when deploying models trained on such single-sensor setups\nto modern vehicles with multiple high-resolution LiDAR sensors. In this work,\nwe introduce a new metric for feature-level invariance which can serve as a\nproxy to measure cross-domain generalization without requiring labeled data.\nAdditionally, we propose two application-specific data augmentations, which\nfacilitate better transfer to multi-sensor LiDAR setups, when trained on\nsingle-sensor datasets. We provide experimental evidence on both simulated and\nreal data, that our proposed augmentations improve invariance across LiDAR\nsetups, leading to improved generalization.",

Previous studies typically focus\non two main paradigms: sample-level and token-level ensembles.

On\nthe other hand, token-level ensemble methods enable real-time correction\nthrough fine-grained ensemble at each generation step. However, the information\ncarried by an individual token is quite limited, leading to suboptimal\ndecisions at each step. To address these issues, we propose SweetSpan, a\nspan-level ensemble method that effectively balances the need for real-time\nadjustments and the information required for accurate ensemble decisions. Our\napproach involves two key steps: First, we have each candidate model\nindependently generate candidate spans based on the shared prefix. Second, we\ncalculate perplexity scores to facilitate mutual evaluation among the candidate\nmodels and achieve robust span selection by filtering out unfaithful scores. To\ncomprehensively evaluate ensemble methods, we propose a new challenging setting\n(ensemble models with significant performance gaps) in addition to the standard\nsetting (ensemble the best-performing models) to assess the performance of\nmodel ensembles in more realistic scenarios. Experimental results in both\nstandard and challenging settings across various language generation tasks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and versatility of our approach\ncompared with previous ensemble methods.",

This suggests\nmagnetic field amplification by dynamo processes. However, observations are\nlimited to redshifts z <~ 0.7, and the weakly collisional nature of the ICM\ncomplicates studying magnetic field evolution at higher redshifts through\ntheoretical models and simulations. Using a model of the weakly collisional\ndynamo, we modelled the evolution of the Faraday rotation measure (RM) in\nclusters of different masses, up to z <~ 1.5, and investigated its properties.\nWe compared our results with radio observations of various galaxy clusters. We\nused merger trees generated by the modified GALFORM algorithm to track the\nevolution of plasma quantities during galaxy cluster formation. Assuming the\nmagnetic field remains in equipartition with the turbulent velocity field, we\ngenerated RM maps to study their properties. We find that both the standard\ndeviation of RM, sigma_RM, and the absolute average |mu_RM| increase with\ncluster mass. Due to redshift dilution, RM values for a fixed cluster mass\nremain nearly constant between z=0 and z=1.5. For r/r200 >~ 0.4, sigma_RM does\nnot vary significantly with L/r200, with L being the size of the observed RM\npatch. Below this limit, sigma_RM increases as L decreases. We find that radial\nRM profiles have a consistent shape, proportional to 10^{-1.2(r/r200)}, and are\nnearly independent of redshift. Our z~0 profiles for M_clust = 10^15 Msol match\nRM observations in the Coma cluster but show discrepancies with Perseus,\npossibly due to high gas mixing. Models for clusters with M_clust = 10^13 and\nM_clust = 10^15 Msol at z=0 and z = 0.174 align well with Fornax and A2345 data\nfor r/r200 <~ 0.4.

In this work, we propose a Probabilistic Graphical Model along with\na pipeline for designing such model -- by which the behaviour of an agent can\nbe deliberated about -- and for computing a robust numerical value for the\nintentions the agent has at any moment. We contribute measurements that\nevaluate the interpretability and reliability of explanations provided, and\nenables explainability questions such as `what do you want to do now?' (e.g.\ndeliver soup) `how do you plan to do it?' (e.g. returning a plan that considers\nits skills and the world), and `why would you take this action at this state?'\n(e.g. explaining how that furthers or hinders its own goals). This model can be\nconstructed by taking partial observations of the agent's actions and world\nstates, and we provide an iterative workflow for increasing the proposed\nmeasurements through better design and/or pointing out irrational agent\nbehaviour.",

To address common problems of damage prognosis, a\npopulation-based SHM (PBSHM) approach is adopted in the current work. In this\napproach the prognosis problem is considered as an information-sharing problem\nwhere data from past structures are exploited to make more accurate inferences\nregarding currently-degrading structures. For a given population, there may\nexist restrictions on the resources available to conduct monitoring; thus, the\ncurrent work studies the problem of allocating such resources within a\npopulation of degrading structures with a view to maximising the\ndamage-prognosis accuracy. The challenges of the current framework are mainly\nassociated with the inference of outliers on the level of damage evolution,\ngiven partial data from the damage-evolution phenomenon. The current approach\nconsiders an initial population of structures for which damage evolution is\nextensively observed. Subsequently, a second population of structures with\nevolving damage is considered for which two monitoring systems are available, a\nlow-availability and high-fidelity (low-uncertainty) one, and a\nwidely-available and low-fidelity (high-uncertainty) one. The task of the\ncurrent work is to follow an active-learning approach to identify the\nstructures to which the high-fidelity system should be assigned in order to\nenhance the predictive capabilities of the machine-learning model throughout\nthe population.",

However, these researches are\nmostly confined to pre-training at the instance-level or single-video\ntracklet-level. They ignore the identity-invariance in images of the same\nperson across different videos, which is a key focus in person\nre-identification. To address this issue, we propose a Cross-video\nIdentity-cOrrelating pre-traiNing (CION) framework. Defining a noise concept\nthat comprehensively considers both intra-identity consistency and\ninter-identity discrimination, CION seeks the identity correlation from\ncross-video images by modeling it as a progressive multi-level denoising\nproblem. Furthermore, an identity-guided self-distillation loss is proposed to\nimplement better large-scale pre-training by mining the identity-invariance\nwithin person images. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the\nsuperiority of our CION in terms of efficiency and performance. CION achieves\nsignificantly leading performance with even fewer training samples.

To address this problem, we\npresent ODiMO, a hardware-aware tool that efficiently explores fine-grain\nmapping of DNNs among various on-chip CUs, during the training phase. ODiMO\nstrategically splits individual layers of the neural network and executes them\nin parallel on the multiple available CUs, aiming to balance the total\ninference energy consumption or latency with the resulting accuracy, impacted\nby the unique features of the different hardware units.

On the one hand, the\nfirst framework already covers the well-known case of regular document\nspanners, while the latter setting covers several practically relevant tasks\nthat cannot be described in the unweighted setting.\n  It is known that in the unweighted case this problem can be solved with\nlinear time preprocessing $O(|D|)$ and output-linear delay $O(|s|)$ in data\ncomplexity, where $D$ is the input data and $s$ is the current output element.\nFor the weighted case, Bourhis, Grez, Jachiet, and Riveros [ICDT 2021] recently\ndesigned an algorithm with linear time preprocessing, but the delay of $O(|s|\n\\cdot \\log|\\mathsf{D}|)$ depends on the size of the data.\n  We first show how to leverage the existing results on enumerating shortest\npaths to obtain a simple alternative algorithm with linear preprocessing and a\ndelay of $O(|s_i| + \\min\\{ \\log i, \\log|\\mathsf{D}|\\})$ for the $i^{\\text{th}}$\noutput element $s_i$ (in data complexity); thus, substantially improving the\nprevious algorithm. Next, we develop a technically involved rounding technique\nthat allows us to devise an algorithm with linear time preprocessing and\noutput-linear delay $O(|s|)$ with high probability. To this end, we combine\ntools from algebra, high-dimensional geometry, and linear programming.",

In\nthis paper, our goal is to reduce the reliance on the size of labeled training\ndata for gaze target detection. To achieve this, we propose AL-GTD, an\ninnovative approach that integrates supervised and self-supervised losses\nwithin a novel sample acquisition function to perform active learning (AL).\nAdditionally, it utilizes pseudo-labeling to mitigate distribution shifts\nduring the training phase. AL-GTD achieves the best of all AUC results by\nutilizing only 40-50% of the training data, in contrast to state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) gaze target detectors requiring the entire training dataset to achieve\nthe same performance. Importantly, AL-GTD quickly reaches satisfactory\nperformance with 10-20% of the training data, showing the effectiveness of our\nacquisition function, which is able to acquire the most informative samples. We\nprovide a comprehensive experimental analysis by adapting several AL methods\nfor the task.

    ],
    "abstract": "We present a new framework for designing nonpreemptive and job-size oblivious\nscheduling policies in the multiserver-job queueing model. The main requirement\nis to identify a static and balanced sub-partition of the server set and ensure\nthat the servers in each set of that sub-partition can only handle jobs of a\ngiven class and in a first-come first-served order. A job class is determined\nby the number of servers to which it has exclusive access during its entire\nexecution and the probability distribution of its service time. This approach\naims to reduce delays by preventing small jobs from being blocked by larger\nones that arrived first, and it is particularly beneficial when the job size\nvariability intra resp. inter classes is small resp. large. In this setting, we\npropose a new scheduling policy, Balanced-Splitting. We provide a sufficient\ncondition for the stability of Balanced-Splitting and show that the resulting\nqueueing probability, i.e., the probability that an arriving job needs to wait\nfor processing upon arrival, vanishes in both the subcritical (the load is kept\nfixed to a constant less than one) and critical (the load approaches one from\nbelow) many-server limiting regimes. Crucial to our analysis is a connection\nwith the M/GI/s/s queue and Erlang's loss formula, which allows our analysis to\nrely on fundamental results from queueing theory. Numerical simulations show\nthat the proposed policy performs better than several preemptive/nonpreemptive\nsize-aware/oblivious policies in various practical scenarios. This is also\nconfirmed by simulations running on real traces from High Performance Computing\n(HPC) workloads. The delays induced by Balanced-Splitting are also competitive\nwith those induced by state-of-the-art policies such as First-Fit-SRPT and\nServerFilling-SRPT, though our approach has the advantage of not requiring\npreemption, nor the knowledge of job sizes.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid development of large language models, serval\nmodels such as GPT-4o have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities, surpassing\nhuman performance in various language tasks. As a result, many researchers have\nbegun exploring their potential applications in the field of public opinion\nanalysis. This study proposes a novel large-language-models-based method for\npublic opinion event heat level prediction. First, we preprocessed and\nclassified 62,836 Chinese hot event data collected between July 2022 and\nDecember 2023. Then, based on each event's online dissemination heat index, we\nused the MiniBatchKMeans algorithm to automatically cluster the events and\ncategorize them into four heat levels (ranging from low heat to very high\nheat). Next, we randomly selected 250 events from each heat level, totalling\n1,000 events, to build the evaluation dataset. During the evaluation process,\nwe employed various large language models to assess their accuracy in\npredicting event heat levels in two scenarios: without reference cases and with\nsimilar case references. The results showed that GPT-4o and DeepseekV2\nperformed the best in the latter case, achieving prediction accuracies of 41.4%\nand 41.5%, respectively. Although the overall prediction accuracy remains\nrelatively low, it is worth noting that for low-heat (Level 1) events, the\nprediction accuracies of these two models reached 73.6% and 70.4%,\nrespectively. Additionally, the prediction accuracy showed a downward trend\nfrom Level 1 to Level 4, which correlates with the uneven distribution of data\nacross the heat levels in the actual dataset. This suggests that with the more\nrobust dataset, public opinion event heat level prediction based on large\nlanguage models will have significant research potential for the future.",

Our objective is to\nbuild a robot policy that accounts for uncontrollable human behaviors, thus\nenabling the anticipation of possible advancements achieved by the robot when\nthe execution is not shared, e.g. when humans are briefly absent from the\nshared environment to complete a subtask. But, this anticipation is considered\nfrom the perspective of humans who have access to an estimated model for the\nrobot.

The planner systematically assesses the situation and ignores\nworlds that it has reason to think are impossible for humans. Overall, our new\nsolver can estimate the distinct beliefs of the human and the robot along\npotential courses of action, enabling the synthesis of plans where the robot\nselects the right moment for communication, i.e. informing, or replying to an\ninquiry, or defers ontic actions until the execution experiences can be shared.\nPreliminary experiments in two domains, one novel and one adapted, demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the framework.",

Although\nencouraging performance has been achieved by combining cognitive learning with\nthe self-training paradigm, they suffer from ambiguous scenarios caused by\nscale, illumination, or overlapping when deploying deterministic embedding. To\naddress these issues, we propose probabilistic proto-typical pixel contrast\n(PPPC), a universal adaptation framework that models each pixel embedding as a\nprobability via multivariate Gaussian distribution to fully exploit the\nuncertainty within them, eventually improving the representation quality of the\nmodel.

This paper introduces a novel instruction curation algorithm, derived\nfrom two unique perspectives, human and LLM preference alignment, to compress\nthis vast corpus of machine-generated multimodal instructions to a compact and\nhigh-quality form: (i) For human preference alignment, we have collected a\nmachine-generated multimodal instruction dataset and established a\ncomprehensive set of both subjective and objective criteria to guide the data\nquality assessment critically from human experts. By doing so, a reward model\nwas trained on the annotated dataset to internalize the nuanced human\nunderstanding of instruction alignment. (ii) For LLM preference alignment,\ngiven the instruction selected by the reward model, we propose leveraging the\ninner LLM used in MLLM to align the writing style of visual instructions with\nthat of the inner LLM itself, resulting in LLM-aligned instruction improvement.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that we can maintain or even improve model\nperformance by compressing synthetic multimodal instructions by up to 90%.\nImpressively, by aggressively reducing the training instructions from 158k to\n14k (9$\\times$ smaller), our model consistently outperforms its full-size\ndataset counterpart across various MLLM benchmarks.

It is worth to note, that however solving DLP over prime\nfields using quantum annealing has been considered before, no author, until\nnow, has considered DLP over binary fields using quantum annealing. Therefore,\nin this paper, we aim to bridge this gap.

In our\nestimations, we assume the existence of an optimal normal base of II type in\nthe given fields. Such a QUBO instance can then be solved using quantum\nannealing.",

    "abstract": "Nighttime UAV tracking under low-illuminated scenarios has achieved great\nprogress by domain adaptation (DA). However, previous DA training-based works\nare deficient in narrowing the discrepancy of temporal contexts for UAV\ntrackers. To address the issue, this work proposes a prompt-driven temporal\ndomain adaptation training framework to fully utilize temporal contexts for\nchallenging nighttime UAV tracking, i.e., TDA. Specifically, the proposed\nframework aligns the distribution of temporal contexts from daytime and\nnighttime domains by training the temporal feature generator against the\ndiscriminator. The temporal-consistent discriminator progressively extracts\nshared domain-specific features to generate coherent domain discrimination\nresults in the time series. Additionally, to obtain high-quality training\nsamples, a prompt-driven object miner is employed to precisely locate objects\nin unannotated nighttime videos. Moreover, a new benchmark for long-term\nnighttime UAV tracking is constructed. Exhaustive evaluations on both public\nand self-constructed nighttime benchmarks demonstrate the remarkable\nperformance of the tracker trained in TDA framework, i.e., TDA-Track.\nReal-world tests at nighttime also show its practicality.

Unlike the\nsingle-object counterpart, a time sequence of states does not necessarily\nrepresent the trajectory of a multi-object system. The LRFS formulation enables\na time sequence of multi-object states to represent the multi-object trajectory\nthat accommodates trajectory crossings and fragmentations. We present the\nbasics of LRFS, covering a suite of commonly used models and mathematical\napparatus (including the latest results not published elsewhere). Building on\nthis, we outline the fundamentals of multi-object state space modeling and\nestimation using LRFS, which formally address object identities/trajectories,\nancestries for spawning objects, and characterization of the uncertainty on the\nensemble of objects (and their trajectories). Numerical solutions to\nmulti-object SSM problems are inherently far more challenging than those in\nstandard SSM.

Here, we\nshow that current state-of-the-art machine learning models trained for weather\nforecasting in present-day climate produce skillful forecasts across different\nclimate states corresponding to pre-industrial, present-day, and future 2.9K\nwarmer climates. This indicates that the dynamics shaping the weather on short\ntimescales may not differ fundamentally in a changing climate. It also\ndemonstrates out-of-distribution generalization capabilities of the machine\nlearning models that are a critical prerequisite for climate applications.\nNonetheless, two of the models show a global-mean cold bias in the forecasts\nfor the future warmer climate state, i.e. they drift towards the colder\npresent-day climate they have been trained for. A similar result is obtained\nfor the pre-industrial case where two out of three models show a warming. We\ndiscuss possible remedies for these biases and analyze their spatial\ndistribution, revealing complex warming and cooling patterns that are partly\nrelated to missing ocean-sea ice and land surface information in the training\ndata.

Then, a critical-path based neighborhood search is\nproposed to enhance the exploitation ability of AMOEA/D. Moreover, the search\ntime is adaptively adjusted based on learning experience from Q-learning and\nDecay Law. Afterward, to enhance the exploration capability of the algorithm,\nAMOEA/D designs an improved population updating strategy with a weight vector\nupdating strategy. These strategies rematch individuals with weight vectors,\nthereby maintaining the diversity of the population. Finally, the proposed\nalgorithm is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

    "abstract": "Diffusion transformers have gained substantial interest in diffusion\ngenerative modeling due to their outstanding performance. However, their high\ncomputational cost, arising from the quadratic computational complexity of\nattention mechanisms and multi-step inference, presents a significant\nbottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose TokenCache, a novel\npost-training acceleration method that leverages the token-based multi-block\narchitecture of transformers to reduce redundant computations among tokens\nacross inference steps. TokenCache specifically addresses three critical\nquestions in the context of diffusion transformers: (1) which tokens should be\npruned to eliminate redundancy, (2) which blocks should be targeted for\nefficient pruning, and (3) at which time steps caching should be applied to\nbalance speed and quality. In response to these challenges, TokenCache\nintroduces a Cache Predictor that assigns importance scores to tokens, enabling\nselective pruning without compromising model performance. Furthermore, we\npropose an adaptive block selection strategy to focus on blocks with minimal\nimpact on the network's output, along with a Two-Phase Round-Robin (TPRR)\nscheduling policy to optimize caching intervals throughout the denoising\nprocess. Experimental results across various models demonstrate that TokenCache\nachieves an effective trade-off between generation quality and inference speed\nfor diffusion transformers. Our code will be publicly available.",

    "abstract": "ABCDE is a sophisticated technique for evaluating differences between very\nlarge clusterings. Its main metric that characterizes the magnitude of the\ndifference between two clusterings is the JaccardDistance, which is a true\ndistance metric in the space of all clusterings of a fixed set of (weighted)\nitems. The JaccardIndex is the complementary metric that characterizes the\nsimilarity of two clusterings. Its relationship with the JaccardDistance is\nsimple: JaccardDistance + JaccardIndex = 1. This paper decomposes the\nJaccardDistance and the JaccardIndex further. In each case, the decomposition\nyields Impact and Quality metrics. The Impact metrics measure aspects of the\nmagnitude of the clustering diff, while Quality metrics use human judgements to\nmeasure how much the clustering diff improves the quality of the clustering.\nThe decompositions of this paper offer more and deeper insight into a\nclustering change. They also unlock new techniques for debugging and exploring\nthe nature of the clustering diff. The new metrics are mathematically\nwell-behaved and they are interrelated via simple equations. While the work can\nbe seen as an alternative formal framework for ABCDE, we prefer to view it as\ncomplementary. It certainly offers a different perspective on the magnitude and\nthe quality of a clustering change, and users can use whatever they want from\neach approach to gain more insight into a change.",

In this\npaper, we generalize the notion of dynamical decoupling to repeated kicks with\na quantum channel, which is applied to the bath. We derive necessary and\nsufficient conditions on the employed quantum channel and find that bath\ndynamical decoupling works if and only if the kick is ergodic. Furthermore, we\nstudy in which circumstances CPTP kicks on a mono-partite quantum system induce\nquantum Zeno dynamics with its Hamiltonian cancelled out. This does not require\nthe ergodicity of the kicks, and the absence of decoherence-free subsystems is\nboth necessary and sufficient. While the standard unitary dynamical decoupling\nis essentially the same as the quantum Zeno dynamics, our investigation implies\nthat this is not true any more in the case of CPTP kicks. To derive our\nresults, we prove some spectral properties of ergodic quantum channels, that\nmight be of independent interest.

    "abstract": "Embedding models play a crucial role in representing and retrieving\ninformation across various NLP applications. Recent advancements in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have further enhanced the performance of embedding\nmodels, which are trained on massive amounts of text covering almost every\ndomain. These models are often benchmarked on general-purpose datasets like\nMassive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), where they demonstrate superior\nperformance. However, a critical question arises: Is the development of\ndomain-specific embedding models necessary when general-purpose models are\ntrained on vast corpora that already include specialized domain texts? In this\npaper, we empirically investigate this question, choosing the finance domain as\nan example. We introduce the Finance Massive Text Embedding Benchmark\n(FinMTEB), a counterpart to MTEB that consists of financial domain-specific\ntext datasets. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art embedding\nmodels on FinMTEB and observe a significant performance drop compared to their\nperformance on MTEB. To account for the possibility that this drop is driven by\nFinMTEB's higher complexity, we propose four measures to quantify dataset\ncomplexity and control for this factor in our analysis. Our analysis provides\ncompelling evidence that state-of-the-art embedding models struggle to capture\ndomain-specific linguistic and semantic patterns. Moreover, we find that the\nperformance of general-purpose embedding models on MTEB is not correlated with\ntheir performance on FinMTEB, indicating the need for domain-specific embedding\nbenchmarks for domain-specific embedding models.

    "abstract": "Coherent radio emission with properties similar to planetary auroral signals\nhas been reported from GJ 1151, a quiescent, slow-rotating mid-M star, by the\nLOFAR Two-metre (120-170 MHz) Sky Survey (LoTSS). The observed {LOFAR} emission\nis fairly bright at 0.89 mJy with 64% circular polarization, and the emission\ncharacteristics are consistent with the interaction between an Earth-sized\nplanet with an orbital period of 1-5 days and the magnetic field of the host\nstar. However, no short-period planet has been detected around GJ 1151. To\nconfirm the reported radio emission caused by the putative planet around GJ\n1151 and to investigate the nature of this emission, we carried out uGMRT\nobservations of GJ 1151 at 150, 218, and 400 MHz over 33 hours across ten\nepochs. No emission was detected at any frequency. While at 150 MHz and 218\nMHz, non-detection could be due to the low sensitivity of our observations, at\n400 MHz, the rms sensitivities achieved were sufficient to detect the emission\nobserved with LOFAR at $\\sim$ 20$\\sigma$ level. Our findings suggest that the\nradio emission is highly time-variable, likely influenced by the star-planet\nsystem's phase and the host star's magnetic field. Additional observations\nbelow 170 MHz, at more frequent epochs (as the periodicity of the emission is\nunknown), especially during periods of high stellar magnetic field strength,\nare needed to confirm the emission.",

We consider two generalizations of Rastall theory:\nBrans-Dicke-Rastall theory and the newly established scalar-tensor-Rastall\ntheory, the latter being a further generalization of the former. The field\nequations in these two generalized theories are studied across different\nparameter spaces, and the polarization modes of gravitational waves, as a key\nfocus, are subsequently investigated. The results show that the polarization\nmodes of gravitational waves in Brans-Dicke-Rastall theory are the same as\nthose in Brans-Dicke theory; specifically, both theories exhibit the plus,\ncross, and breathing modes. However, in scalar-tensor-Rastall theory, the\npolarization modes of gravitational waves depend on the parameter space of the\ntheory. Particularly, over a broad range of the parameter space, regardless of\nsome special values of the parameters, it allows only two tensor modes, just as\nin general relativity, without introducing any additional degrees of freedom.\nThis indicates that Rastall theory offers a novel approach to constructing\nmodified gravity theories that propagate only two tensor degrees of freedom. In\nthe remaining regions of the parameter space, there is also one scalar mode in\naddition to the two tensor modes. The scalar mode can be either a mixture of\nthe breathing and longitudinal modes or just a pure breathing mode, depending\non the parameter space.

By partitioning large\ndatasets into meaningful groups, clustering reveals hidden structures and\nrelationships within the data, aiding tasks such as unsupervised learning,\nclassification, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems. Particularly in\nrelational databases, where data is distributed across multiple tables,\nefficient clustering is essential yet challenging due to the computational\ncomplexity of joining tables. This paper addresses this challenge by\nintroducing efficient algorithms for $k$-median and $k$-means clustering on\nrelational data without the need for pre-computing the join query results. For\nthe relational $k$-median clustering, we propose the first efficient relative\napproximation algorithm. For the relational $k$-means clustering, our algorithm\nsignificantly improves both the approximation factor and the running time of\nthe known relational $k$-means clustering algorithms, which suffer either from\nlarge constant approximation factors, or expensive running time. Given a join\nquery $Q$ and a database instance $D$ of $O(N)$ tuples, for both $k$-median and\n$k$-means clustering on the results of $Q$ on $D$, we propose randomized\n$(1+\\varepsilon)\\gamma$-approximation algorithms that run in roughly\n$O(k^2N^{\\mathsf{fhw}})+T_\\gamma(k^2)$ time, where $\\varepsilon\\in (0,1)$ is a\nconstant parameter decided by the user, $\\mathsf{fhw}$ is the fractional\nhyper-tree width of $Q$, while $\\gamma$ and $T_\\gamma(x)$ are respectively the\napproximation factor and the running time of a traditional clustering algorithm\nin the standard computational setting over $x$ points.",

One immediate challenge is modeling temporal\npatterns with the finite length of the input. These temporal patterns usually\ninvolve periodic and sudden events that recur across different channels. To\nbetter capture temporal patterns, we get inspiration from humans' memory\nmechanisms and propose a channel-shared, brain-inspired memory module for MTS.\nSpecifically, brain-inspired memory comprises semantic and episodic memory,\nwhere the former is used to capture general patterns, such as periodic events,\nand the latter is employed to capture special patterns, such as sudden events,\nrespectively. Meanwhile, we design corresponding recall and update mechanisms\nto better utilize these patterns. Furthermore, acknowledging the capacity of\ndiffusion models to leverage memory as a prior, we present a brain-inspired\nmemory-augmented diffusion model. This innovative model retrieves relevant\nmemories for different channels, utilizing them as distinct priors for MTS\npredictions. This incorporation significantly enhances the accuracy and\nrobustness of predictions.

The\nsolution in the limit as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$ is known as the zero dispersion\nlimit. We demonstrate that the semi-discrete FSG scheme conserves the first\nthree integral invariants, thereby structure preserving, and that the fully\ndiscrete FSG scheme is $L^2$-conservative, ensuring stability. Using a\ncompactness argument, we constructively prove the convergence of the\napproximate solution to the unique solution of the fractional KdV equation in\n$C([0,T]; H_p^{1+\\alpha}(\\mathbb{R}))$ for the periodic initial data in\n$H_p^{1+\\alpha}(\\mathbb{R})$.

Because the running times of standard solvers increase\nlinearly with frequency when they are applied to such problems, a variety of\nspecialized methods, most of them quite complicated, have been proposed. Here,\nwe point out that one of the simplest approaches not only works, but yields a\nscheme for solving oscillatory second order linear ordinary differential\nequations which is significantly faster than current state-of-the-art\ntechniques. Our method, which operates by constructing a slowly varying phase\nfunction representing a basis of solutions of the differential equation, runs\nin time independent of the frequency and can be applied to second order\nequations whose solutions are oscillatory in some regions and slowly varying in\nothers. In the high-frequency regime, our algorithm discretizes the nonlinear\nRiccati equation satisfied by the derivative of the phase function via a\nChebyshev spectral collocation method and applies the Newton-Kantorovich method\nto the resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations. We prove that the\niterates converge quadratically to a nonoscillatory solution of the Riccati\nequation. The quadratic convergence of the Newton-Kantorovich method and the\nsimple form of the linearized equations ensure that this procedure is extremely\nefficient. Our algorithm then extends the slowly varying phase function\ncalculated in the high-frequency regime throughout the solution domain by\nsolving a certain third order linear ordinary differential equation related to\nthe Riccati equation. We describe the results of numerical experiments showing\nthat our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes,\nincluding the modified Magnus method [18], the current state-of-the-art\napproach [7] and the recently introduced ARDC method [1].",

Recent advancements have uncovered that the performance of\nspatiotemporal forecasting can be significantly improved by integrating\nknowledge in geo-distributed time series data from different domains, \\eg\nenhancing real-estate appraisal with human mobility data; joint taxi and bike\ndemand predictions. While effective, existing approaches assume a centralized\ndata collection and exploitation environment, overlooking the privacy and\ncommercial interest concerns associated with data owned by different parties.\nIn this paper, we investigate multi-party collaborative spatiotemporal\nforecasting without direct access to multi-source private data. However, this\ntask is challenging due to 1) cross-domain feature heterogeneity and 2)\ncross-client geographical heterogeneity, where standard horizontal or vertical\nfederated learning is inapplicable. To this end, we propose a Heterogeneous\nSpatioTemporal Federated Learning (HSTFL) framework to enable multiple clients\nto collaboratively harness geo-distributed time series data from different\ndomains while preserving privacy. Specifically, we first devise vertical\nfederated spatiotemporal representation learning to locally preserve\nspatiotemporal dependencies among individual participants and generate\neffective representations for heterogeneous data. Then we propose a\ncross-client virtual node alignment block to incorporate cross-client\nspatiotemporal dependencies via a multi-level knowledge fusion scheme.\nExtensive privacy analysis and experimental evaluations demonstrate that HSTFL\nnot only effectively resists inference attacks but also provides a significant\nimprovement against various baselines.",

With this unified token representation, Temporal2Seq can train a\ngeneralist model within a single architecture on different video understanding\ntasks. In the absence of multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks, we compile a\ncomprehensive co-training dataset by borrowing the datasets from TAD, TAS, and\nGEBD tasks. We evaluate our Temporal2Seq generalist model on the corresponding\ntest sets of three tasks, demonstrating that Temporal2Seq can produce\nreasonable results on various tasks and achieve advantages compared with\nsingle-task training on this framework.

The method is based on a phase-locking ring array of lasers created\ninside a degenerate cavity with a binary amplitude mask containing circular\nholes. The diffraction engineering of the mask profile allows to control the\ncomplex coupling between the lasers. The asymmetry between different lasers is\nintroduced by varying the hole diameters corresponding to different lasers.\nSeveral examples of masks with non-uniform or uniform circular holes are\ninvestigated numerically and analytically to assess the impact of non-uniform\ncomplex coupling coefficients on the degeneracy between the vortex and\nanti-vortex steady-states of the ring laser arrays. It is found that the\nin-phase solution always dominates irrespective of non-uniform masks. The only\nsolution to make one particular vortex solution dominant over other possible\nsteady-state solutions consists in imprinting the necessary phase shift among\nneighboring lasers in the argument of their coupling coefficients. We also\ninvestigate the role of the Henry factor inherent to the use of a semiconductor\nactive medium in the probabilities to generate vortex solutions.

UW-DiffPhys combines\nlight-computation physical-based UIE network components with a denoising U-Net\nto replace the computationally intensive distribution transformation U-Net in\nthe existing UW-DDPM framework, reducing complexity while maintaining\nperformance.

The\nenumeration of $s$-biplexes from a given graph is a fundamental problem in\nbipartite graph analysis. However, in real-world data engineering, finding all\n$s$-biplexes is neither necessary nor computationally affordable. A more\nrealistic problem is to identify some of the largest $s$-biplexes from the\nlarge input graph. We formulate the problem as the {\\em top-$k$ $s$-biplex\nsearch (TBS) problem}, which aims to find the top-$k$ maximal $s$-biplexes with\nthe most vertices, where $k$ is an input parameter. We prove that the TBS\nproblem is NP-hard for any fixed $k\\ge 1$. Then, we propose a branching\nalgorithm, named MVBP, that breaks the simple $2^n$ enumeration algorithm.\nFurthermore, from a practical perspective, we investigate three techniques to\nimprove the performance of MVBP: 2-hop decomposition, single-side bounds, and\nprogressive search. Complexity analysis shows that the improved algorithm,\nnamed FastMVBP, has a running time $O^*(\\gamma_s^{d_2})$, where $\\gamma_s<2$,\nand $d_2$ is a parameter much smaller than the number of vertex in the sparse\nreal-world graphs, e.g. $d_2$ is only $67$ in the AmazonRatings dataset which\nhas more than $3$ million vertices. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments\non eight real-world and synthetic datasets to demonstrate the empirical\nefficiency of the proposed algorithms. In particular, FastMVBP outperforms the\nbenchmark algorithms by up to three orders of magnitude in several instances.",

Among such vulnerabilities, Read-Only Reentrancy (called ROR in\nthis paper), is an emerging type of vulnerability that arises from the complex\ninteractions between DApps. In the recent three years, attack incidents of ROR\nhave already caused around 30M USD losses to the DApp ecosystem. Existing\ntechniques for vulnerability detection in smart contracts can hardly detect\nRead-Only Reentrancy attacks, due to the lack of tracking and analyzing the\ncomplex interactions between multiple DApps. In this paper, we propose\nSmartReco, a new framework for detecting Read-Only Reentrancy vulnerability in\nDApps through a novel combination of static and dynamic analysis (i.e.,\nfuzzing) over smart contracts. The key design behind SmartReco is threefold:\n(1) SmartReco identifies the boundary between different DApps from the\nheavy-coupled cross-contract interactions. (2) SmartReco performs fine-grained\nstatic analysis to locate points of interest (i.e., entry functions) that may\nlead to ROR. (3) SmartReco utilizes the on-chain transaction data and performs\nmulti-function fuzzing (i.e., the entry function and victim function) across\ndifferent DApps to verify the existence of ROR. Our evaluation of a\nmanual-labeled dataset with 45 RORs shows that SmartReco achieves a precision\nof 88.63% and a recall of 86.36%.

    "abstract": "In realistic cellular communication systems, multiple service providers will\noperate within different frequency ranges. Each serving cell, which is managed\nby a distinct service provider, is designed individually due to the orthogonal\nfrequencies. However, when a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is\ndeployed for a certain cell, the RIS still incurs reflective channels for the\noverall system since the RIS reflects signals across all frequency ranges. This\nmay cause severe undesired performance degradation for the other cells unless\nthe reflection coefficients are properly designed. To tackle this issue, by\nutilizing the Riemannian manifold optimization method, an RIS reflection\ncoefficients design is proposed in this paper to maximize the performance\nimprovements of the cell that deploys the RIS while minimizing the undesired\nperformance degradation for the other cells simultaneously. Numerical results\ndemonstrate that the proposed design can effectively balance the two objectives\nfor practical scenarios.",

Despite its potential,\nstandard FL lacks support for diverse heterogeneous device prototypes, which\nvary significantly in model and dataset sizes -- from small IoT devices to\nlarge workstations. This limitation is only partially addressed by existing\nknowledge distillation techniques, which often fail to transfer knowledge\neffectively across a broad spectrum of device prototypes with varied\ncapabilities. This failure primarily stems from two issues: the dilution of\ninformative logits from more capable devices by those from less capable ones,\nand the use of a single integrated logits as the distillation target across all\ndevices, which neglects their individual learning capacities and and the unique\ncontributions of each. To address these challenges, we introduce TAKFL, a novel\nKD-based framework that treats the knowledge transfer from each device\nprototype's ensemble as a separate task, independently distilling each to\npreserve its unique contributions and avoid dilution. TAKFL also incorporates a\nKD-based self-regularization technique to mitigate the issues related to the\nnoisy and unsupervised ensemble distillation process. To integrate the\nseparately distilled knowledge, we introduce an adaptive task arithmetic\nknowledge integration process, allowing each student model to customize the\nknowledge integration for optimal performance. Additionally, we present\ntheoretical results demonstrating the effectiveness of task arithmetic in\ntransferring knowledge across heterogeneous devices with varying capacities.\nComprehensive evaluations of our method across both CV and NLP tasks\ndemonstrate that TAKFL achieves SOTA results in a variety of datasets and\nsettings, significantly outperforming existing KD-based methods Code is\nreleased at https://github.com/MMorafah/TAKFL",

    "abstract": "This study introduces the development of hands-free control schemes for a\nriding ballbot, designed to allow riders including manual wheelchair users to\ncontrol its movement through torso leaning and twisting. The hardware platform,\nPersonal Unique Rolling Experience (PURE), utilizes a ballbot drivetrain, a\ndynamically stable mobile robot that uses a ball as its wheel to provide\nomnidirectional maneuverability. To accommodate users with varying torso motion\nfunctions, the hanads-free control scheme should be adjustable based on the\nrider's torso function and personal preferences. Therefore, concepts of (a)\nimpedance control and (b) admittance control were integrated into the control\nscheme. A duo-agent optimization framework was utilized to assess the\nefficiency of this rider-ballbot system for a safety-critical task: braking\nfrom 1.4 m/s. The candidate control schemes were further implemented in the\nphysical robot hardware and validated with two experienced users, demonstrating\nthe efficiency and robustness of the hands-free admittance control scheme\n(HACS). This interface, which utilized physical human-robot interaction (pHRI)\nas the input, resulted in lower braking effort and shorter braking distance and\ntime. Subsequently, 12 novice participants (six able-bodied users and six\nmanual wheelchair users) with different levels of torso motion capability were\nthen recruited to benchmark the braking performance with HACS. The indoor\nnavigation capability of PURE was further demonstrated with these participants\nin courses simulating narrow hallways, tight turns, and navigation through\nstatic and dynamic obstacles. By exploiting pHRI, the proposed admittance-style\ncontrol scheme provided effective control of the ballbot via torso motions.\nThis interface enables PURE to provide a personal unique rolling experience to\nmanual wheelchair users for safe and agile indoor navigation.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing a nonlinear function over nonconvex sets is challenging since\nsolving convex relaxations may lead to substantial relaxation gaps and\ninfeasible solutions, that must be \"rounded\" to feasible ones, often with\nuncontrollable losses in objective function performance. For this reason, these\nconvex hulls are especially useful if the objective function is linear or even\nconcave since concave optimization is invariant to taking the convex hull of\nthe feasible set. Motivated by this observation, we propose the notion of\nconcave tents, which are concave approximations of the original objective\nfunction that agree with this objective function on the feasible set, and allow\nfor concave reformulations of the problem. We derive these concave tents for a\nlarge class of objective functions as the optimal value functions of conic\noptimization problems. Hence, evaluating our concave tents requires solving a\nconic problem. Interestingly, we can find supergradients by solving the conic\ndual problem, so that differentiation is of the same complexity as evaluation.\nFor feasible sets that are contained in the extreme points of their convex\nhull, we construct these concave tents in the original space of variables. For\ngeneral feasible sets, we propose a double lifting strategy, where the original\noptimization problem is lifted into a higher dimensional space in which the\nconcave tent can be constructed with a similar effort. We investigate the\nrelation of the so-constructed concave tents to concave envelopes and a naive\nconcave tent based on concave quadratic updates. Based on these ideas we\npropose a primal heuristic for a class of robust discrete quadratic\noptimization problems, that can be used instead of classical rounding\ntechniques. Numerical experiments suggest that our techniques can be beneficial\nas an upper bounding procedure in a branch and bound solution scheme.",

However, with data\nhosted in these services being beyond the control of the data owners, it raises\nsignificant concerns about privacy in personal data sharing. Many schemes have\nbeen proposed to realize fine-grained access control and privacy protection in\ndata sharing. However, they fail to protect the rights of data owners to their\ndata under the law, since their designs focus on the management of system\nadministrators rather than enhancing the data owners' privacy. In this paper,\nwe introduce a novel task-driven personal data sharing system based on the data\ncapsule paradigm realizing personal data sharing autonomy. It enables data\nowners in our system to fully control their data, and share it autonomously.\nSpecifically, we present a tamper-resistant data capsule encapsulation method,\nwhere the data capsule is the minimal unit for independent and secure personal\ndata storage and sharing. Additionally, to realize selective sharing and\ninformed-consent based authorization, we propose a task-driven data sharing\nmechanism that is resistant to collusion and EDoS attacks. Furthermore, by\nupdating parts of the data capsules, the permissions granted to data consumers\ncan be immediately revoked. Finally, we conduct a security and performance\nanalysis, proving that our scheme is correct, sound, and secure, as well as\nrevealing more advantageous features in practicality, compared with the\nstate-of-the-art schemes.",

    "abstract": "While traditional federated learning (FL) typically focuses on a star\ntopology where clients are directly connected to a central server, real-world\ndistributed systems often exhibit hierarchical architectures. Hierarchical FL\n(HFL) has emerged as a promising solution to bridge this gap, leveraging\naggregation points at multiple levels of the system. However, existing\nalgorithms for HFL encounter challenges in dealing with multi-timescale model\ndrift, i.e., model drift occurring across hierarchical levels of data\nheterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a multi-timescale gradient correction\n(MTGC) methodology to resolve this issue. Our key idea is to introduce distinct\ncontrol variables to (i) correct the client gradient towards the group\ngradient, i.e., to reduce client model drift caused by local updates based on\nindividual datasets, and (ii) correct the group gradient towards the global\ngradient, i.e., to reduce group model drift caused by FL over clients within\nthe group. We analytically characterize the convergence behavior of MTGC under\ngeneral non-convex settings, overcoming challenges associated with couplings\nbetween correction terms. We show that our convergence bound is immune to the\nextent of data heterogeneity, confirming the stability of the proposed\nalgorithm against multi-level non-i.i.d. data. Through extensive experiments on\nvarious datasets and models, we validate the effectiveness of MTGC in diverse\nHFL settings.

Bayesian optimal\nexperimental design (OED) seeks to identify data, sensor configurations, or\nexperiments which can optimally reduce uncertainty and hence increase the\nperformance of a monitoring network. Information theory guides OED by\nformulating the choice of experiment or sensor placement as an optimization\nproblem that maximizes the expected information gain (EIG) about quantities of\ninterest given prior knowledge and models of expected observation data.\nTherefore, within the context of seismo-acoustic monitoring, we can use\nBayesian OED to configure sensor networks by choosing sensor locations, types,\nand fidelity in order to improve our ability to identify and locate seismic\nsources. In this work, we develop the framework necessary to use Bayesian OED\nto optimize a sensor network's ability to locate seismic events from arrival\ntime data of detected seismic phases at the regional-scale. Bayesian OED\nrequires four elements:\n  1) A likelihood function that describes the distribution of detection and\ntravel time data from the sensor network,\n  2) A Bayesian solver that uses a prior and likelihood to identify the\nposterior distribution of seismic events given the data,\n  3) An algorithm to compute EIG about seismic events over a dataset of\nhypothetical prior events,\n  4) An optimizer that finds a sensor network which maximizes EIG.\n  Once we have developed this framework, we explore many relevant questions to\nmonitoring such as: how to trade off sensor fidelity and earth model\nuncertainty; how sensor types, number, and locations influence uncertainty; and\nhow prior models and constraints influence sensor placement.",

Two\ndecoders, namely physics-based and non-physics-based decoder, use this latent\nembedding and predict the future motion patterns.

A classifier also\nleverages the same latent space embeddings to recognise the ASD severity. This\ndual generative objective explicitly forces the network to compare the actual\nbehaviour of the subject with the general normal behaviour of children that are\ngoverned by the laws of physics, aiding the ASD recognition task. The proposed\nmethod attains state-of-the-art performance on multiple ASD diagnosis\nbenchmarks.

However, the weak\nmagneto-optical signals and instability of two dimensional (2D)\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) materials have hindered comprehensive studies on the\ncomplex coupling between magnetic order and excitons in bulk-like systems.\nHere, we leverage magneto-optical spectroscopy to reveal the impact of magnetic\norder on exciton-phonon coupling and exciton-magnetic order coupling which\nremains robust even under non-extreme temperature conditions (80 K) in thick\nlayered CrSBr. A 0.425T in-plane magnetic field is sufficient to induce spin\nflipping and transition from AFM to ferromagnetic (FM) magnetic order in CrSBr,\nwhile magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy under an out-of-plane\nmagnetic field provides direct insight into the complex spin canting behavior\nin thicker layers. Theoretical calculations reveal that the strong coupling\nbetween excitons and magnetic order, especially the 32 meV exciton energy shift\nduring magnetic transitions, stems from the hybridization of Cr and S orbitals\nand the larger exciton wavefunction radius of higher-energy B excitons.

These cosmological shocks are thought to accelerate cosmic ray (CR)\nprotons and electrons via diffusive shock acceleration. Recent advances in\nparticle-in-cell and hybrid simulations have provided deeper insights into the\nkinetic plasma processes that govern microinstabilities and particle\nacceleration in collisionless shocks in weakly magnetized astrophysical plasma.\nIn this study, we adopt a thermal-leakage type injection model and DSA\npower-law distribution functions in the test-particle regime. The CR proton\nspectrum directly connects to the Maxwellian distribution of protons at the\ninjection momentum $p_{\\rm{inj}} = Q_p p_{\\rm {th,p}}$. On the other hand, the\nCR electron spectrum extends down to $p_{\\rm{min}}=Q_ep_{\\rm{th,e}}$ and is\nlinked to the Maxwellian distribution of electrons. Here, $p_{\\rm{th,p}}$ and\n$p_{\\rm{th,e}}$, are the proton and electron thermal momenta, respectively.\nMoreover, we propose that the postshock gas temperature and the injection\nparameters, $Q_p$ and $Q_e$ are self-regulated to maintain the test-particle\ncondition, as the thermal energy is gradually transferred to the CR energy.\nUnder these constraints, we estimate the self-regulated values of the\ntemperature reduction factor, $R_T$, and the proton injection parameter, $Q_p$,\nalong with the resulting CR efficiencies, $\\eta_p$ and $\\eta_e$. We then\nprovide analytical fitting functions for these parameters as functions of the\nshock Mach number, $M_s$.

    "abstract": "Perceiving the global field from sparse sensors has been a grand challenge in\nthe monitoring, analysis, and design of physical systems. In this context,\nsensor placement optimization is a crucial issue. Most existing works require\nlarge and sufficient data to construct data-based criteria, which are\nintractable in data-free scenarios without numerical and experimental data. To\nthis end, we propose a novel physics-driven sensor placement optimization\n(PSPO) method for temperature field reconstruction using a physics-based\ncriterion to optimize sensor locations. In our methodological framework, we\nfirstly derive the theoretical upper and lower bounds of the reconstruction\nerror under noise scenarios by analyzing the optimal solution, proving that\nerror bounds correlate with the condition number determined by sensor\nlocations. Furthermore, the condition number, as the physics-based criterion,\nis used to optimize sensor locations by the genetic algorithm. Finally, the\nbest sensors are validated by reconstruction models, including non-invasive\nend-to-end models, non-invasive reduced-order models, and physics-informed\nmodels. Experimental results, both on a numerical and an application case,\ndemonstrate that the PSPO method significantly outperforms random and uniform\nselection methods, improving the reconstruction accuracy by nearly an order of\nmagnitude. Moreover, the PSPO method can achieve comparable reconstruction\naccuracy to the existing data-driven placement optimization methods.",

We have found that the two resilience indicators of each\nmarket have a relatively consistent trend, but connectedness among markets has\ndifferent sensitivities to both. In addition, China's CPU affects its financial\nmarket resilience by increasing the investor sentiment index and the\nnon-performing loan ratio of commercial banks, and by reducing the capital and\nfinancial account balance.

What\nexacerbates this situation is that, given complex intransitive or cyclic\nrelationships in preference datasets, existing algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs\nare still far from capturing comprehensive preferences. This raises severe\ncost-efficiency concerns in production environments, where preference data\naccumulate over time. In this paper, we discuss the fine-tuning of LLMs as a\nmonetized economy and introduce an auction mechanism to improve the efficiency\nof preference data collection in dollar terms.

    "abstract": "Radio galaxies are classified into two primary categories based on their\nmorphology: center-brightened FR-I and edge-brightened FR-II. It is believed\nthat the jet power and interactions with the ambient medium govern the\ndeceleration and decollimation of the jet-spine flows, which, in turn,\ninfluence this dichotomy. Using high-resolution, three-dimensional relativistic\nhydrodynamic simulations, we follow the development of flow structures on\nsub-kpc to kpc scales in kinetically dominant low-power relativistic jets. We\nfind that the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet spine and the advance speed of the\njet head, which depend on the energy injection flux and the jet-to-background\ndensity contrast, primarily determine the dynamics and structures of the\njet-induced flows. The entrainment of ambient gas and the background density\nand pressure gradient may also play significant roles. To emulate radio\nmorphology, we produce the synthetic maps of the synchrotron surface brightness\nfor the simulated jets, by employing simple models for magnetic field\ndistribution and nonthermal electron population and considering relativistic\nbeaming effects at different inclination angles. Both the flow structures and\nradio maps capture the longitudinal and transverse structures of the jet-spine\nand shear layer, consistent with observations. We also compare different\nbackground effects and argue that the loss of pressure confinement beyond the\ngalactic core may be a key factor in the flaring and disruption of FR-I jets.\nOur results confirm that mildly relativistic jets could explain the\none-sidedness or asymmetries with the boosted main jet and deboosted counterjet\npairs.",

Experimental results show that\nperformance on the JHMDB21 dataset improves significantly when query features\nare shifted using the proposed query matching.",

However, MCU cost\nconstraints rule out the usual security mechanisms of general-purpose\ncomputers. Thus, various low-cost security architectures have been proposed to\nremotely verify MCU software integrity. Control Flow Attestation (CFA) enables\na Verifier (Vrf) to remotely assess the run-time behavior of a prover MCU\n(Prv), generating an authenticated trace of all of Prv control flow transfers\n(CFLog). Further, Control Flow Auditing architectures augment CFA by\nguaranteeing the delivery of evidence to Vrf.\n  Unfortunately, a limitation of existing CFA lies in the cost to store and\ntransmit CFLog, as even simple MCU software may generate large traces. Given\nthese issues, prior work has proposed static (context-insensitive)\noptimizations. However, they do not support configurable program-specific\noptimizations. In this work, we note that programs may produce unique\npredictable control flow sub-paths and argue that program-specific\npredictability can be leveraged to dynamically optimize CFA while retaining all\nsecurity guarantees. Therefore, we propose SpecCFA: an approach for dynamic\nsub-path speculation in CFA. SpecCFA allows Vrf to securely speculate on likely\ncontrol flow sub-paths for each attested program. At run-time, when a sub-path\nin CFLog matches a pre-defined speculation, the entire sub-path is replaced by\na reserved symbol. SpecCFA can speculate on multiple variable-length control\nflow sub-paths simultaneously. We implement SpecCFA atop two open-source\ncontrol flow auditing architectures: one based on a custom hardware design and\none based on a commodity Trusted Execution Environment (ARM TrustZone-M). In\nboth cases, SpecCFA significantly lowers storage/performance costs that are\ncritical to resource-constrained MCUs.",

By incorporating\nphysical knowledge, SciML reduces the dependency on observational data, which\nis often limited in the natural sciences. In this article, the fundamental\nconcepts of SciML, its applications in seismology, and prospects are described.\nSpecifically, two popular methods are mainly discussed: physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs) and neural operators (NOs). PINNs can address both forward and\ninverse problems by incorporating governing laws into the loss functions. The\nuse of PINNs is expanding into areas such as simultaneous solutions of\ndifferential equations, inference in underdetermined systems, and\nregularization based on physics. These research directions would broaden the\nscope of deep learning in natural sciences. NOs are models designed for\noperator learning, which deals with relationships between infinite-dimensional\nspaces. NOs show promise in modeling the time evolution of complex systems\nbased on observational or simulation data. Since large amounts of data are\noften required, combining NOs with physics-informed learning holds significant\npotential. Finally, SciML is considered from a broader perspective beyond deep\nlearning: statistical (or mathematical) frameworks that integrate observational\ndata with physical principles to model natural phenomena. In seismology,\nmathematically rigorous Bayesian statistics has been developed over the past\ndecades, whereas more flexible and scalable deep learning has only emerged\nrecently.

    "abstract": "Computing the exact optimal experimental design has been a longstanding\nchallenge in various scientific fields. This problem, when formulated using a\nspecific information function, becomes a mixed-integer nonlinear programming\n(MINLP) problem, which is typically NP-hard, thus making the computation of a\nglobally optimal solution extremely difficult. The branch and bound (BnB)\nmethod is a widely used approach for solving such MINLPs, but its practical\nefficiency heavily relies on the ability to solve continuous relaxations\neffectively within the BnB search tree. In this paper, we propose a novel\nprojected Newton framework, combining with a vertex exchange method for\nefficiently solving the associated subproblems, designed to enhance the BnB\nmethod. This framework offers strong convergence guarantees by utilizing recent\nadvances in solving self-concordant optimization and convex quadratic\nprogramming problems. Extensive numerical experiments on A-optimal and\nD-optimal design problems, two of the most commonly used models, demonstrate\nthe framework's promising numerical performance. Specifically, our framework\nsignificantly improves the efficiency of node evaluation within the BnB search\ntree and enhances the accuracy of solutions compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods. The proposed framework is implemented in an open source Julia package\ncalled \\texttt{PNOD.jl}, which opens up possibilities for its application in a\nwide range of real-world scenarios.",

The\nstudy utilizes monthly AMS-02 data on proton and helium fluxes and their ratio\nto examine the evolution of solar modulation from May 2011 to May 2017. To\nimprove the fitting, the force-field approximation is modified by assigning\ndifferent solar modulation potentials for high ( $\\phi_h$ ) and low ($\\phi_l$ )\nenergy ranges. A sigmoid function is employed to describe the transition\nbetween these energy ranges. The analysis reveals that the break in proton and\nhelium fluxes occurs at the same rigidity value, with a mean of approximately 6\nGV and this break is more pronounced during the heliospheric magnetic field\nreversal period. The $\\phi_l$ is close to the result of Advanced Composition\nExplorer (ACE) while the $\\phi_h$ is close to the result of neutron monitor\n(NM) data.

Existing methods for exploring\ndata change list differences exhaustively, which are not interpretable by\nhumans and lack salient insights regarding change trends.

Our key observation is that, while\ndatasets often evolve through point and other small-batch updates, rich data\nfeatures can reveal latent semantics that can intuitively summarize the\nchanges. Under the hood, ChARLES compares database versions, infers feasible\ntransformations by fitting multiple regression lines over different data\npartitions to derive change summaries, and ranks them.

    "abstract": "A simple model is proposed aimed to investigate how the amount of dissociated\nions influences the mechanical stability of viral capsids. After an osmotic and\nmechanical equilibrium is established with the outer solution, a non-adiabatic\nchange in salt concentration at the external environment is considered, which\nresults in a significant solvent inflow across the capsid surface, eventually\nleading to its rupture. The key assumption behind such an osmotic shock\nmechanism is that solvent flow takes place at timescales much shorter than the\nones typical of ionic diffusion. In order to theoretically describe this\neffect, we herein propose a thermodynamic model based on the traditional Flory\ntheory. The proposed approach is further combined with a continuum Hookian\nelastic model of surface stretching and pore-opening along the lines of a\nClassical Nucleation Theory (CNT), allowing us to establish the conditions\nunder which capsid mechanical instability takes place. Despite its non-local\ncharacter, the proposed model is able to capture most of the relevant physical\nmechanisms controlling capsid stability, namely the volume exclusion and\nentropy of mixing effects among the densely-packed components, the elastic cost\nfor capsid stretching and further pore opening, the Donnan equilibrium across\nthe interface, as well as the large entropy loss resulting from folding the\nviral genome into close-packed configurations inside the capsid. It is shown\nthat, depending on the particular combination of initial condition and capsid\nsurface strength, the capsid can either become unstable after removal of a\nprescribed amount of external salt, or be fully stable against osmotic shock,\nregardless of the amount of ionic dilution.",

In this paper, several well-known Riemannian\ngeometric structures of HPD matrix manifolds are applied to signal detection,\nincluding the affine invariant Riemannian metric, the log-Euclidean metric, and\nthe Bures--Wasserstein (BW) metric, the last of which was recently extended to\nHPD manifolds. Riemannian gradient descent algorithms are proposed to solve the\ncorresponding geometric means and medians, that play fundamental roles in the\ndetection process. Simulations within the scenario using the ideal steering\nvector as the target signal provide compelling evidence that the BW detectors\noutperform the other geometric detectors as well as the conventional adaptive\nmatched filter and adaptive normalized matched filter when observation data are\nlimited. Further simulations demonstrate that the matrix-CFAR is robust in\nscenarios where the signal is mismatched. In addition to detection\nperformances, robustness of the geometric detectors to outliers and\ncomputational complexity of the algorithms are analysed.",

However, many\ndata such as natural images usually do not populate the ambient Euclidean space\nbut instead reside in a lower-dimensional manifold. Thus an inappropriate\nchoice of the latent dimension fails to uncover the structure of the data,\npossibly resulting in mismatch of latent representations and poor generative\nqualities. Towards addressing these problems, we propose a novel framework\ncalled the latent Wasserstein GAN (LWGAN) that fuses the Wasserstein\nauto-encoder and the Wasserstein GAN so that the intrinsic dimension of the\ndata manifold can be adaptively learned by a modified informative latent\ndistribution. We prove that there exist an encoder network and a generator\nnetwork in such a way that the intrinsic dimension of the learned encoding\ndistribution is equal to the dimension of the data manifold. We theoretically\nestablish that our estimated intrinsic dimension is a consistent estimate of\nthe true dimension of the data manifold. Meanwhile, we provide an upper bound\non the generalization error of LWGAN, implying that we force the synthetic data\ndistribution to be similar to the real data distribution from a population\nperspective. Comprehensive empirical experiments verify our framework and show\nthat LWGAN is able to identify the correct intrinsic dimension under several\nscenarios, and simultaneously generate high-quality synthetic data by sampling\nfrom the learned latent distribution.",

In response, we propose an end-to-end humanoid\nsense-plan-act walking system, enabling vision-based obstacle avoidance and\nfootstep planning for whole body balancing simultaneously. We designed two\nimperative learning (IL)-based bilevel optimizations for model-predictive step\nplanning and whole body balancing, respectively, to achieve self-supervised\nlearning for humanoid robot walking. This enables the robot to learn from\narbitrary unlabeled data, improving its adaptability and generalization\ncapabilities. We refer to our method as iWalker and demonstrate its\neffectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments, representing a\nsignificant advancement toward autonomous humanoid robots.",

The proposed\ndesign for CRC analysis integrates an observational study cohort with a\nrandomized trial involving a small representative study sample, and enhances\nthe generalizability and transportability of the findings. Methods: We develop\na novel CRC-type estimator derived via multinomial distribution-based\nmaximum-likelihood that exploits the design to deliver benefits in terms of\nvalidity and efficiency for comparing the effects of two treatments on a binary\noutcome. Additionally, the design enables a direct standardization-type\nestimator for efficient estimation of general means (e.g., of biomarker levels)\nunder a specific treatment, and for their comparison across treatments. For\ninference, we propose a tailored Bayesian credible interval approach to improve\ncoverage properties in conjunction with the proposed CRC estimator for binary\noutcomes, along with a bootstrap percentile interval approach for use in the\ncase of continuous outcomes. Results: Simulations demonstrate the proposed\nestimators derived from the CRC design. The multinomial-based\nmaximum-likelihood estimator shows benefits in terms of validity and efficiency\nin treatment effect comparisons, while the direct standardization-type\nestimator allows comprehensive comparison of treatment effects within the\ntarget population. Conclusion: The extended CRC methods provide a useful\nframework for causal inference in a trial-eligible target population by\nintegrating observational and randomized trial data. The novel estimators\nenhance the generalizability and transportability of findings, offering\nefficient and valid tools for treatment effect comparisons on both binary and\ncontinuous outcomes.",

In\nsemiconductor heterostructures, such mixtures can be realized, with bosons as\nexcitons and fermions as dopant charges. However, the complexity of these\nhybrid systems challenges the comprehension of the mechanisms that determine\nphysical properties such as mobility. In this study, we investigate interlayer\nexciton diffusion in an H-stacked WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayer. Our\nmeasurements are performed in the ultra-low exciton density regime at low\ntemperatures to examine how the presence of charges affects exciton mobility.\nRemarkably, for charge doping near the Mott insulator phase, we observe a giant\nenhancement of exciton diffusion of three orders of magnitude compared to\ncharge neutrality. We attribute this observation to mobile valence holes, which\nexperience a suppressed moir\\'e potential due to the electronic charge order in\nthe conduction band, and recombine with any conduction electron in a\nnon-monogamous manner. This new mechanism emerges for sufficiently large\nfillings in the vicinity of correlated generalized Wigner crystal and Mott\ninsulating states.

On the other hand,\nfederated learning requires iterative communication across institutions and has\na big challenge for implementation in situations where continuous communication\nwith the outside world is extremely difficult. In this study, we propose a\nfederated data collaboration learning (FedDCL), which solves such communication\nissues by combining federated learning with recently proposed non-model\nshare-type federated learning named as data collaboration analysis. In the\nproposed FedDCL framework, each user institution independently constructs\ndimensionality-reduced intermediate representations and shares them with\nneighboring institutions on intra-group DC servers. On each intra-group DC\nserver, intermediate representations are transformed to incorporable forms\ncalled collaboration representations. Federated learning is then conducted\nbetween intra-group DC servers. The proposed FedDCL framework does not require\niterative communication by user institutions and can be implemented in\nsituations where continuous communication with the outside world is extremely\ndifficult. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed\nFedDCL is comparable to that of existing federated learning.",
