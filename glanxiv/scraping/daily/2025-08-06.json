Traditional estimation\ntechniques fundamentally fail under mobility, with feedback delays as small as\n4 ms causing 50% throughput degradation at even modest speeds (30 km/h). We\npresent neural Gaussian radio fields (nGRF), a novel framework that leverages\nexplicit 3D Gaussian primitives to synthesize complex channel matrices\naccurately and efficiently. Unlike NeRF-based approaches that rely on slow\nimplicit representations or existing Gaussian splatting methods that use\nnon-physical 2D projections, nGRF performs direct 3D electromagnetic field\naggregation, with each Gaussian acting as a localized radio modulator. nGRF\ndemonstrates superior performance across diverse environments: in indoor\nscenarios, it achieves a 10.9$\\times$ higher prediction SNR than state of the\nart methods while reducing inference latency from 242 ms to just 1.1 ms (a\n220$\\times$ speedup). For large-scale outdoor environments, where existing\napproaches fail to function, nGRF achieves an SNR of 26.2 dB. Moreover, nGRF\nrequires only 0.011 measurements per cubic foot compared to 0.2-178.1 for\nexisting methods, thereby reducing data collection burden by 18$\\times$.\nTraining time is similarly reduced from hours to minutes (a 180$\\times$\nreduction), enabling rapid adaptation to dynamic environments.

This study facilitates the understanding of the local\nequilibrium property of the medium through the Knudsen number, and explores the\ncorrelation between the heat flow and the charge flow through the Lorenz number\nin the Wiedemann-Franz law for an anisotropic hot QCD medium at finite baryon\nasymmetry. We have determined the electrical and the thermal conductivities by\nsolving the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time\napproximation within the kinetic theory approach. The interactions among\npartons are appended through the particle distribution functions within the\nquasiparticle model of the hot QCD medium at finite temperature, anisotropy and\nbaryon asymmetry. We have observed a decrease in both electrical and thermal\nconductivities in the presence of expansion-induced anisotropy for baryonless\nscenario as well as for baryon asymmetric scenario. Conversely, these\nconductivities are found to be larger in the baryon asymmetric matter as\ncompared to their counterparts in the baryonless matter. The impact of\nanisotropy on the baryon asymmetric matter is as conspicuous as on the\nbaryonless matter. The above results are attributed to the squeezing of the\ndistribution function due to the momentum anisotropy generated by the\nasymptotic expansion of baryon asymmetric matter and the dispersion relations\nof partons in the presence of anisotropy. Additionally, the aforesaid\nobservables are also modulated by the expansion-induced anisotropy in the\nbaryon asymmetric medium, indicating new predictions for the equilibrium\ncharacteristic and the relative behavior between the heat and charge flow for\nthe said medium.",

The multi-field is similar to a field as it assigns determinate values\nto N-tuples of points, but is also different from a field as it does not assign\npre-existing values at each point of 3D space. In particular, the multi-field\nvalues corresponding to the empty points (points where no particles are\nlocated) have indeterminate values until a particle is located at those points.\nThe paper suggests that the multi-field so defined can be precisely\ncharacterized in terms of determinable-based, object-level, account of\nmetaphysical indeterminacy.

The sensitivities of the solution\nto the grid element size and polynomial order are investigated to determine an\naccurate and computationally efficient approach to simulating high-speed\nairbreathing propulsion vehicles. The results demonstrate that DG(p = 2)\nsolutions, which are nominally third-order accurate in smooth regions of the\nflow, show reasonable agreement with existing experimental results. The\nseparation shock formation behind the jet is found to be heavily grid dependent\nand necessary for accurate simulations of the reacting jet in supersonic\ncrossflow.

Our method aligns the\ndistribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of\nperspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without\nretraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens\nas a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for\nalignment.

Its usual replacement,\nthe $L_2$ star discrepancy, is smooth but exhibits other pathologies shown by\nJ. Matou\\v{s}ek. In an attempt to address these problems, we introduce the\n\\textit{average squared discrepancy} which averages over $2^d$ versions of the\n$L_2$ star discrepancy anchored in the different vertices of $[0,1]^d$. Not\nonly can this criterion be computed in $O(dn^2)$ time, like the $L_2$ star\ndiscrepancy, but also we show that it is equivalent to a weighted symmetric\n$L_2$ criterion of Hickernell's by a constant factor. We compare this criterion\nwith a wide range of traditional discrepancy measures, and show that only the\naverage squared discrepancy avoids the problems raised by Matou\\v{s}ek.\nFurthermore, we present a comprehensive numerical study showing in particular\nthat optimizing for the average squared discrepancy leads to strong performance\nfor the $L_2$ star discrepancy, whereas the converse does not hold.",

Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio\nand visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced\nhighlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a\ntest-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses\nthis limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better\nalign with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving\ngeneralization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly\noptimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the\nprimary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme\nto enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the\nprimary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary\ntask on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.\nExtensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models\nand three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to\nthese models improves their performance, yielding superior results.",

These spirals\nvanish when the disc is fully broken or aligned. Our results show that the\nformation of leading spirals is driven by the relative misalignment of the\ninner and outer disc, and does not depend on the disc physics. With live\nradiative transfer, the shadows cast by the misaligned inner disc are also able\nto launch trailing spiral arms that only appear at high misalignments when the\ndiscs are disconnected. When the disc is strongly misaligned, leading and\ntrailing spiral arms can both appear and interact with each other. At lower\nmisalignments, the impact of shadows is negligible and leading spiral arms are\nseen instead.

    "abstract": "We explore gravitational-wave (GW) signatures from a strong first-order phase\ntransition in a non-Abelian dark sector, which naturally gives rise to vector\ndark matter. We consider a general class of models featuring a new dark gauge\nsector communicating with the Standard Model (SM) through a Higgs portal and a\nvector-like fermionic portal. We also study the scenario where the dark sector\ninteracts with the SM only via gravity. In all cases, we scan the full\nparameter space and analyse GW production, highlighting that secluded dark\nsectors, with excessive dark radiation, fail to produce a LISA-observable GW\nbackground. Notably, the fermionic portal yields distinctive GW signals at LISA\nwith peak frequencies of 1-10 mHz, reaching up to 1 Hz for future\ninterferometers like BBO and DECIGO, while the Higgs portal scenario remains\nlimited to around 1 mHz. Both frameworks account for the observed dark matter\nabundance and predict detectable LISA signals for dark vector bosons near 3-4\nTeV (Higgs portal) and 10 TeV (fermionic portal), with a $\\sim$10 GeV dark\nHiggs. Finally, we identify a unique six-top final state from pair-produced\nvector-like fermions, offering a striking collider signature within HL-LHC\nreach. Its detection would provide a smoking-gun signal for the fermionic\nportal, establishing complementarity between collider, GW, and dark matter\nsignals.",

However, due to a lack of real understanding of the\nphysics of AGN feedback, these models vary significantly across simulations. To\ndistinguish between the models and potentially test the underlying physics, we\ncarry out independent tests of these models. In an earlier study, we found that\n$F_{\\rm AGN}$ -- the observed completeness-corrected fraction of galaxies\nhosting radio AGN with an Eddington ratio $\\lambda > 10^{-3}$ -- to be a strong\nfunction of host galaxy stellar mass ($M_\\star$) but nearly independent of host\nspecific star formation rates (sSFR) at fixed $M_\\star$.

We present a comprehensive theoretical and\nempirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a\nmathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between\nadaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the\nformalization of selection sensitivity ($\\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures\nhow adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We\nprove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two\nindependent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than\na threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while\ndecreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the\nMultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform\nsampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical\nrelationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly\nadaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve\nsuperior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates,\nwhile less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%. Crucially, we\nshow that source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism,\nreducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains.

However, the magnitude of\nthis surface energy reduction quickly decreases with increasing number of\natomic layers inside the single vdW layer for different vdW materials. Such\natomic-layer-dependence in surface energy reduction helps explain the different\neffectiveness of exfoliation for different vdW materials down to a single vdW\nlayer.",

In\nthis paper, we introduce an automated pipeline that reduces each video to a\nsingle frame that best matches the reported bug description, giving developers\ninstant visual evidence that pinpoints the bug.\n  Our pipeline begins with FFmpeg for keyframe extraction, reducing each video\nto a median of just 1.90% of its original frames while still capturing bug\nmoments in 98.79 of cases. These keyframes are then evaluated by a\nvision--language model (GPT-4o), which ranks them based on how well they match\nthe textual bug description and selects the most representative frame.

Ni\ncoated Ag nanowires were employed as SERS substrates to enhance signal\nintensity and enable the real-time detection of carbonate , bicarbonate , and\nhydroxide species under controlled humidity conditions in both air and nitrogen\natmospheres. The results reveal humidity-dependent interconversion between\nanionic species, with significant spectral shifts confirming the reversible\nhydrolysis reactions that drive the MS mechanism.

Beginning with a densely defined\nself-adjoint operator $A$ on a Hilbert space $H$, a spectral-transform functor\n$\\Phi$ is applied iteratively. This process generates a transfinite sequence of\noperators, $\\{\\Phi^{\\alpha}(A)\\}_{\\alpha<\\Omega}$, by progressively enlarging\nthe ambient Hilbert space at each ordinal stage. Under suitable continuity and\nmonotonicity conditions on $\\Phi$, it is established via transfinite induction\nthat the sequence converges, stabilizing at a minimal ordinal $\\Omega$ where\n$\\Phi^{\\Omega+1}(A) = \\Phi^{\\Omega}(A)$. The resultant limit operator,\n$A_{\\infty} = \\Phi^{\\infty}(A)$, is a self-adjoint fixed point of the\ntransformation, satisfying $\\Phi(A_{\\infty}) = A_{\\infty}$. Its spectrum is\ncharacterized by the relation\n$$\\sigma(A_{\\infty})=\\bigcap_{n<\\infty}f^{\\,n}\\bigl(\\sigma(A)\\bigr),$$ where\n$f$ is the spectral map induced by $\\Phi$. For canonical transformations, such\nas $\\Phi(A)=A^2$ or the semigroup action $\\Phi_t(A)=e^{tA}$, the limit operator\n$A_{\\infty}$ is identified as the orthogonal projection onto the iteratively\ninvariant eigenspaces of the initial operator $A$.

    "abstract": "Relative transfer functions (RTFs) of sound sources play a crucial role in\nbeamforming, enabling effective noise and interference suppression. This paper\naddresses the challenge of online estimating the RTF vectors of multiple sound\nsources in noisy and reverberant environments, for the specific scenario where\nsources activate successively. While the RTF vector of the first source can be\nestimated straightforwardly, the main challenge arises in estimating the RTF\nvectors of subsequent sources during segments where multiple sources are\nsimultaneously active. The blind oblique projection (BOP) method has been\nproposed to estimate the RTF vector of a newly activating source by optimally\nblocking this source. However, this method faces several limitations: high\ncomputational complexity due to its reliance on iterative gradient descent\noptimization, the introduction of random additional vectors, which can\nnegatively impact performance, and the assumption of high signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR). To overcome these limitations, in this paper we propose three extensions\nto the BOP method. First, we derive a closed-form solution for optimizing the\nBOP cost function, significantly reducing computational complexity. Second, we\nintroduce orthogonal additional vectors instead of random vectors, enhancing\nRTF vector estimation accuracy. Third, we incorporate noise handling techniques\ninspired by covariance subtraction and whitening, increasing robustness in low\nSNR conditions. To provide a frame-by-frame estimate of the source activity\npattern, required by both the conventional BOP method and the proposed method,\nwe propose a spatial-coherence-based online source counting method.

In this work, we explore the opposite direction, investigating whether\ndynamics can be directly implemented over probability measures.

Our approach introduces a new\ntype of layer -- the Gaussian mixture (GM) layer -- that can be integrated into\nneural network architectures. As a proof of concept, we validate our proposal\nthrough experiments on simple classification tasks, where a GM layer achieves\ntest performance comparable to that of a two-layer fully connected network.\nFurthermore, we examine the behavior of these dynamics and demonstrate\nnumerically that GM layers exhibit markedly different behavior compared to\nclassical fully connected layers, even when the latter are large enough to be\nconsidered in the mean-field regime.",

However, this method\nhas some limitations, including the periodicity assumption of the Fourier\ntransform. In addition, there are other methods of analysing a signal, beyond\nphase and amplitude perspective, and provide us with other useful information\nto learn an effective network. We introduce the \\textbf{Hilbert Neural Operator\n(HNO)}, a new neural operator architecture to address some advantages by\nincorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing. HNO operates by\nfirst mapping the input signal to its analytic representation via the Hilbert\ntransform, thereby making instantaneous amplitude and phase information\nexplicit features for the learning process. The core learnable operation -- a\nspectral convolution -- is then applied to this Hilbert-transformed\nrepresentation. We hypothesize that this architecture enables HNO to model\noperators more effectively for causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary\nsystems. We formalize the HNO architecture and provide the theoretical\nmotivation for its design, rooted in analytic signal theory.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computers have grown in size and qubit quality in recent years,\nenabling the execution of complex quantum circuits. However, for most\nresearchers, access to compute time on quantum hardware is limited. This\nnecessitates the need to build simulators that mimic the execution of quantum\ncircuits on noisy quantum hardware accurately and scalably.\n  In this work, we propose TUSQ - Tracking, Uncomputation, and Sampling for\nNoisy Quantum Simulation. To represent the stochastic noisy channels\naccurately, we average the output of multiple quantum circuits with fixed noisy\ngates sampled from the channels. However, this leads to a substantial increase\nin circuit overhead, which slows down the simulation. To eliminate this\noverhead, TUSQ uses two modules: the Error Characterization Module (ECM), and\nthe Tree-based Execution Module (TEM).\n  The ECM tracks the number of unique circuit executions needed to accurately\nrepresent the noise. That is, if initially we needed $n_{1}$ circuit\nexecutions, ECM reduces that number to $n_{2}$ by eliminating redundancies so\nthat $n_{2} < n_{1}$. This is followed by the TEM, which reuses computation\nacross these $n_{2}$ circuits. This computational reuse is facilitated by\nrepresenting all $n_{2}$ circuits as a tree. We sample the significant leaf\nnodes of this tree and prune the remaining ones. We traverse this tree using\ndepth-first search. We use uncomputation to perform rollback-recovery at\nseveral stages which reduces simulation time. We evaluate TUSQ for a total of\n186 benchmarks and report an average speedup of $52.5\\times$ and $12.53\\times$\nover Qiskit and CUDA-Q, which goes up to $7878.03\\times$ and $439.38\\times$\nrespectively. For larger benchmarks (more than than 15 qubits), the average\nspeedup is $55.42\\times$ and $23.03\\times$ over Qiskit and CUDA-Q respectively",

    "abstract": "Background: Lithium plays an important role in nuclear astrophysics, fusion\nenergy generation, and nuclear technology. From a theoretical point of view,\nthe nucleus $^7$Li presents a remarkable challenge, as its bound states and\nresonances can be understood as being formed by a $^4$He and $^3$H pair, or\nsimultaneously, a single neutron/proton coupled to a $^6$Li/$^6$He core. In\nlight of this complexity, a consistent description of $^7$Li bound-state and\ncontinuum properties in a unified model presents a significant advancement\ntowards a predictive theory of nuclear structure and reactions.\n  Purpose: Towards achieving such a predictive description, we carry out\ncalculations for $^7$Li within an ab initio framework, taking into account the\nmass/charge partitions $^6$Li + $n$ and $^6$He + $p$ in a single\ncoupled-channel calculation. This approach allows us to both investigate the\neffects of the coupling between partitions on the spectrum of $^7$Li, and\ncalculate the cross sections for the $^6$Li($n,p)^6$He and $^6$He($p,n)^6$Li\nreactions.\n  Method: We use the no-core shell model with continuum, which is capable of\ndescribing both bound and scattering states in a unified framework.\n  Results: Our calculation reproduces all the experimentally observed states of\n$^7$Li in the correct order and predicts new resonances. We also calculated the\ncross section of the reaction $^6$He($p,n)^6$Li and differential cross sections\nof the elastic scattering of protons on $^6$He to provide theoretical results\nfor comparison with planned experiments.\n  Conclusions: The overall shape of the cross section of the reaction\n$^6$Li$(n,p)^6$He as a function of energy is reproduced, although the absolute\nmagnitude is overestimated due to omission of the ($n,\\alpha$) reaction\nchannel. A more accurate description of the cross section is achieved by\nphenomenological adjustmenting the energies of resonances.",

Using Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) to measure\nperturbation identification quality, we reveal that gradient-based ranking\noutperforms attention and random selection approaches, with identification\nquality correlating with detection performance for word-level attacks.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating the asymptotic stability\nof equilibrium points in both continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT)\nnonlinear autonomous systems. By utilizing indirect Lyapunov methods and\nlinearizing system dynamics through Jacobian matrices, the methodology replaces\ntraditional semi-definite programming (SDP) techniques with computationally\nefficient linear programming (LP) conditions. This substitution substantially\nlowers the computational burden, including time and memory usage, particularly\nfor high-dimensional systems. The stability criteria are developed using matrix\ntransformations and leveraging the structural characteristics of the system,\nimproving scalability. Several examples demonstrated the computational\nefficiency of the proposed approach compared to the existing SDP-based\ncriteria, particularly for high-dimensional systems.",

    "abstract": "We consider linear search for capturing an oblivious moving target by two\nautonomous robots with different communicating abilities. Both robots can\ncommunicate Face-to-Face (F2F) when co-located but in addition one robot is a\nSender (can also send messages wirelessly) and the other also a Receiver (can\nalso receive messages wirelessly). This is known as Sender/Receiver (S/R, for\nshort) communication model. The robots can move with max speed $1$. The moving\ntarget starts at distance $d$ from the origin and can move either with speed\n$v<1$ away from the origin in the ``away'' model or with speed $v \\geq 0$\ntoward the origin in the ``toward'' model. We assume that the direction of\nmotion of the target (i.e., whether it is the away or toward model) is known to\nthe robots in advance. To capture the target the two robots must be co-located\nwith it.\n  We design new linear search algorithms and analyze the competitive ratio of\nthe time required to capture the target. The approach takes into account\nvarious scenarios related to what the robots know about the search environment\n(e.g., starting distance or speed of the mobile, away or toward model, or a\ncombination thereof). Our study contributes to understanding how asymmetric\ncommunication affects the competitive ratio of linear search.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) presents a groundbreaking approach for collaborative\nhealth research, allowing model training on decentralized data while\nsafeguarding patient privacy. FL offers formal security guarantees when\ncombined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies,\nhowever, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical\nutility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often\npresent in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these\ninterconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL\nframework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial\nexperiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data,\nresulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first\nintegrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek\nLinks (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically\nuseful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using\na tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear\ntrade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the\noptimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal\noperational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong\nprivacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high\nclinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a\npractical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate\ndiagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare\ndata.",

X-ray polarization from this\nregion is almost perpendicular to the expected direction in the case of Sgr A*\nillumination and shows a smaller PD compared to the large region. This could\nindicate the simultaneous propagation of several illumination fronts throughout\nthe CMZ, with the origin of one of them not being Sgr A*.

In this work, we rigorously investigate whether vanilla SGD, devoid\nof any adaptive modifications, can provably succeed under such adverse\nstochastic conditions. Assuming only that stochastic gradients have bounded\n$p$-th moments for some $p \\in (1, 2]$, we establish sharp convergence\nguarantees for (projected) SGD across convex, strongly convex, and non-convex\nproblem classes. In particular, we show that SGD achieves minimax optimal\nsample complexity under minimal assumptions in the convex and strongly convex\nregimes: $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{p}{p-1}})$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{p}{2(p-1)}})$, respectively. For non-convex\nobjectives under H\\\"older smoothness, we prove convergence to a stationary\npoint with rate $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{2p}{p-1}})$, and complement\nthis with a matching lower bound specific to SGD with arbitrary polynomial\nstep-size schedules. Finally, we consider non-convex Mini-batch SGD under\nstandard smoothness and bounded central moment assumptions, and show that it\nalso achieves a comparable $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{2p}{p-1}})$ sample\ncomplexity with a potential improvement in the smoothness constant. These\nresults challenge the prevailing view that heavy-tailed noise renders SGD\nineffective, and establish vanilla SGD as a robust and theoretically principled\nbaseline -- even in regimes where the variance is unbounded.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyses the risk factors around investing in global supply chain\ninfrastructure: the energy market, investor sentiment, and global shipping\ncosts. It presents portfolio strategies associated with dynamic risks. A\ntime-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) model is used to study\nthe spillover and interconnectedness of the risk factors for global supply\nchain infrastructure portfolios from January 5th, 2010, to June 29th, 2023,\nwhich are associated with a set of environmental, social, and governance (ESG)\nindexes. The effects of extreme events on risk spillovers and investment\nstrategy are calculated and compared before and after the COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe results of this study demonstrate that risk shocks influence the dynamic\nconnectedness between global supply chain infrastructure portfolios and three\nrisk factors and show the effects of extreme events on risk spillovers and\ninvestment outcomes. Portfolios with higher ESG scores exhibit stronger dynamic\nconnectedness with other portfolios and factors. Net total directional\nconnectedness indicates that West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Baltic Exchange Dry\nIndex (BDI), and investor sentiment volatility index (VIX) consistently are net\nreceivers of spillover shocks. A portfolio with a ticker GLFOX appears to be a\ntime-varying net receiver and giver. The pairwise connectedness shows that WTI\nand VIX are mostly net receivers. Portfolios with tickers CSUAX, GII, and FGIAX\nare mostly net givers of spillover shocks. The COVID-19 outbreak changed the\nstructure of dynamic connectedness on portfolios. The mean value of HR and HE\nindicates that the weights of long/short positions in investment strategy after\nthe COVID-19 outbreak have undergone structural changes compared to the period\nbefore. The hedging ability of global supply chain infrastructure investment\nportfolios with higher ESG scores is superior.",

This paper presents the\nfirst quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants\nof OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ\nalgorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error\nand derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the\ncalibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis\nprovides theoretical justification for several practical design choices,\nincluding the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as\nwell as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic\nvariant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control\nover the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for\ndownstream layers and nonlinearities.

Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main\ntypes: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep\nreasoning (e.g., \"what is in the image?\"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,\nwhich concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle\nclues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and\ncomplex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local\ndetails than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though\noccupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information\nfor robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel\nframework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,\noften occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these\nclues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully\ndesigned questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System\nState, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by\nstructured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from\nthem. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual\nevidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to\nenhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,\nintegration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like\nanalysis.

A stochastic anchor sampling strategy further enhances robustness\nby balancing semantic stability and intra-class diversity.

    "abstract": "A well-known conjecture of Gross and Zagier states that the values of the\nhigher automorphic Green's function at pairs of points with complex\nmultiplication in the upper half-plane are proportional to the logarithm of an\nalgebraic number. It was recently settled in the case of congruence subgroups\nof the form $\\Gamma_0(N)$ by analytic methods. In this paper we provide a\ngeometric and motivic interpretation of the general conjecture, and show that\nit is a consequence of a standard conjecture in the theory of motives. In\naddition, we define a new class of matrix-valued higher Green's functions for\nboth odd and even weight modular forms, and show that they are single-valued\nperiods of a motive constructed from a suitable moduli stack of elliptic curves\nwith marked points. The motive has the structure of a biextension involving\nsymmetric powers of the motives of elliptic curves. This suggests a very\ngeneral extension of the Gross-Zagier conjecture relating values of\nmatrix-valued higher Green's functions at points which do not necessarily have\ncomplex multiplication to special values of $L$-functions. In particular, our\nmotivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier log-algebraicity conjecture enables\nus to give a completely geometric proof in level 1 and weight 4 by showing that\nthe motive of the moduli stack $\\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$ of elliptic curves with 3\nmarked points is mixed Tate.\n  In the course of this paper we develop many new foundational results on: the\ntheory of weak harmonic lifts, meromorphic modular forms, biextensions of\nmodular motives, and their corresponding algebraic de Rham cohomology and\nsingle-valued periods, which may all be of independent interest.",

While initially the so-called inverse Lieb lattice (ILL)\nwas deemed only a theoretical model, recently several real materials with this\ncrystallographic motif have been found. The unique geometry of ILL can\naccommodate complex magnetic orderings arising from competing exchange\ninteractions and geometric frustration, offering great tunability for magnetic\nproperties. In this work, we provide comprehensive insights into magnetic\nphases in ILL materials and establish guidelines for efficient identification\nof altermagnetic materials within this family. We begin by constructing phase\ndiagrams using a simple Heisenberg model to elucidate the fundamental\nmechanisms underlying altermagnetism and other complex magnetic phases observed\nexperimentally. To bridge theory with experiment, we systematically investigate\na series of existing ILL compounds using density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations to determine their magnetic ground states. Our computational\nresults are in good agreement with experimental observations. Importantly, we\nidentify a trend linking magnetic ordering to the $d$-shell filling of\ntransition metal ions, with $d^{2-3}$ and $d^{5}$ configurations showing\npropensity for altermagnetic behavior. Additionally, we identify a promising\nmetallic compound Sr$_{2}$CrO$_{2}$Cr$_{2}$OAs$_{2}$ as an altermagnet that is\nhighly anisotropic in its $J_2$ exchange couplings with large N\\'eel\ntemperature ($\\sim 600$ K).

However, clinical CT is insensitive to\nmicrostructure. This study examines how bone/marrow microstructure introduces\nvariations in acoustic property relationships to CT HUs. The insertion loss was\nfound through skull-mimicking digital phantoms with two materials (bone/marrow)\nfrom 0 to 75% porosity. The phantoms had one of six pore diameters ranging from\n0.2 mm to 1.0 mm. k-Wave simulations were computed with a continuous 230 kHz or\n650 kHz uniform pressure source. The insertion loss was defined as the\ntransmitted mean pressure relative to a water-only reference. The 230 kHz loss\nchanged with porosity, but microstructure had little effect. However, the 650\nkHz loss in both non-absorbing and absorbing simulations depended on porosity\nand pore diameter. Larger pore phantoms generally had higher losses than\nsmaller pore diameter phantoms at the same porosity. In the non-absorbing\nphantoms, the maximum range in insertion loss was 2% to 52%, which occurred at\n20% porosity. Absorption increased the loss by 8.2% on average, with the\ngreatest increase of 13% in the smallest pore (0.2 mm) and 2.5% porosity\nphantom. Coherent multiple reflections from the phantom's planar interfaces\ninfluenced the loss from smaller pores, while larger pores disrupt this phase\ncoherence. The insertion loss dependence on porosity and pore diameter shows\nthat the attenuation-HU relationship is ill-determined at 650 kHz. This\nuncertainty has implications for CT-derived acoustic models, as no single\nattenuation corresponds to HUs with variable microstructures.",

The first test was conducted with two different groups\n(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting\nwith the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using\nincreasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.\nThe results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived\naffective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human\nobserver rather than reacting at random.

Traditional linear preconditioning techniques\nenhance convergence, but their performance remains limited due to their\ndependence on the structure of the sensing matrix. Learning-based linear\npreconditioners have been proposed, but they are optimized only for\ndata-fidelity optimization, which may lead to solutions in the null-space of\nthe sensing matrix. This paper employs knowledge distillation to design a\nnonlinear preconditioning operator. In our method, a teacher algorithm using a\nbetter-conditioned (synthetic) sensing matrix guides the student algorithm with\nan ill-conditioned sensing matrix through gradient matching via a\npreconditioning neural network. We validate our nonlinear preconditioner for\nplug-and-play FISTA in single-pixel, magnetic resonance, and super-resolution\nimaging tasks, showing consistent performance improvements and better empirical\nconvergence.",

Using specialized dictionaries tailored to\nCOVID-19, unconventional monetary policy (UMP), and financial stability,\ncombined with sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques, we identify a\ndistinct focus in Fed communication during the pandemic on financial stability,\nmarket volatility, social welfare, and UMP, characterized by notable contextual\nuncertainty. Through comparative analysis, we juxtapose the Fed's communication\nduring the COVID-19 crisis with its responses during the dot-com and global\nfinancial crises, examining content, sentiment, and timing dimensions. Our\nfindings reveal that Fed communication and policy actions were more reactive to\nthe COVID-19 crisis than to previous crises. Additionally, declining sentiment\nrelated to financial stability in interest rate announcements and minutes\nanticipated subsequent accommodative monetary policy decisions. We further\ndocument that communicating about UMP has become the \"new normal\" for the Fed's\nFederal Open Market Committee meeting minutes and Chairman's speeches since the\nGlobal Financial Crisis, reflecting an institutional adaptation in\ncommunication strategy following periods of economic distress.

    "abstract": "Online services are commonly implemented with a scalable microservice\narchitecture, where isomorphic worker processes service client requests,\nrecording persistent state in a backend data store. To maintain service, any\nmodifications to the service functionality must be made on the fly -- i.e., as\nthe service continues to process client requests -- but doing so is\nchallenging. The central difficulty is that of avoiding potential\ninconsistencies caused by ''mixed mode'' operation, where workers of current\nand new versions are concurrently active and interact via the data store. Some\nupdate methods avoid mixed mode altogether, but only at the cost of substantial\ninefficiency -- by doubling resources (memory and compute), or by halving\nthroughput. The alternative is a so-called ''rolling'' update, which is\nuncontrolled and runs the risk of serious service failures arising from\ninconsistent mixed-mode behavior.\n  In this paper, we present the first algorithms that guarantee consistency for\nmixed mode updates. The algorithms rely on semantic properties of service\nactions, such as commutativity. We show that semantic awareness is required, by\nproving that any semantically oblivious, mixed-mode update method cannot avoid\ninconsistencies. Ideally, it should appear to every client that a service\nupdate takes effect atomically; this ensures that a client is not exposed to\ninconsistent mixed-mode behavior. We introduce a framework that formalizes this\nintuition and develop foundational theory for reasoning about the consistency\nof mixed-mode updates, applying that theory to derive the new algorithms and\nestablish their correctness.",

This open-endedness\nprovides societies with the ability to continually expand their resources and\nto increase their capacity to store, transmit and process information at a\ncollective-level. Here, we propose that the production of resources arises from\nthe interaction between technological systems (a society's repertoire of\ninterdependent skills, techniques and artifacts) and search spaces (the\naggregate collection of needs, problems and goals within a society). Starting\nfrom this premise we develop a macro-level model wherein both technological\nsystems and search spaces are subject to cultural evolutionary dynamics. By\nmanipulating the extent to which these dynamics are characterised by stochastic\nor selection-like processes, we demonstrate that open-ended growth is extremely\nrare, historically contingent and only possible when technological systems and\nsearch spaces co-evolve. Here, stochastic factors must be strong enough to\ncontinually perturb the dynamics into a far-from-equilibrium state, whereas\nselection-like factors help maintain effectiveness and ensure the sustained\nproduction of resources. Only when this co-evolutionary dynamic maintains\neffective technological systems, supports the ongoing expansion of the search\nspace and leads to an increased provision of resources do we observe open-ended\ntechnological evolution.",

Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level\nlogging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function,\ndifficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with\nproject-specific logging conventions.

    "abstract": "Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection\nand segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged\nas a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and\nVAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on\nnormal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a\npredefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The\ncorresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse\nsampling.\n  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)\nthe reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple\nsampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or\nsubtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal\npattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate\nintermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and\noften assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in\nunsupervised settings.\n  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based\ndiffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of\nreconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that\nreconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the\ndiffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational\nefficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the\nMVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and\nstatistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on\nMVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best\nmodel.\n  Code available at: https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/RADAR",

CoMAD distills from three\npretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct\nsemantic and contextual priors.

Teacher embeddings are\naligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,\nthen fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by\ncombining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained\nwith dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,\ncapturing both local and global structure.

In such conditions,\ncritical material properties such as thermal stability, elasticity, thermal\nconductivity and thermodynamics behavior are predominantly influenced by\nphonons. In CCCs, pronounced cation disorder can lead to significant phonon\nscattering due to inherent mass and force constant variations, impacting these\ncritical properties. In this study, we used ab initio calculations to predict\nthe phonon band structures and systematically explore the influence of mass and\nforce constant variance on the phonon spectral function of CCCs with a rock\nsalt structure, ranging from binary to five-metal component carbides. Our\nfindings reveal that the selection and concentration of constituent elements\ncan be strategically utilized to tune the phonon band structure, phonon bandgap\nand phonon scattering in CCCs, thereby enabling control over phonon-related\nproperties. Additionally, we measured the thermal conductivity of some of these\nCCCs using the spatial-domain thermoreflectance technique. Interestingly, the\nmeasured thermal conductivity of some of these CCCs indicates that\nfive-component ceramics exhibit higher thermal conductivity than certain\nternary and binary alloys.

To\nbridge this gap, we propose DMFI, a dual-modality framework that integrates\nsemantic inference with behavior-aware fine-tuning. DMFI converts raw logs into\ntwo structured views: (1) a semantic view that processes content-rich artifacts\n(e.g., emails, https) using instruction-formatted prompts; and (2) a behavioral\nabstraction, constructed via a 4W-guided (When-Where-What-Which) transformation\nto encode contextual action sequences.

    "abstract": "Semi-analytic models are a valuable tool to study the first stars and\ngalaxies. Their numerical efficiency makes it possible to survey broad regions\nof astrophysical parameter space across large volumes and redshift ranges.\nFollowing reionization in these models is necessary since star formation is\nsuppressed in ionized regions due to photoheating of the gas. Here we evaluate\nthe accuracy of three semi-analytic reionization prescriptions (two previously\ndeveloped and one new model) by comparing their three-dimensional distribution\nof ionized bubbles to the Renaissance hydrodynamical cosmological radiative\ntransfer simulations. We find that the previously existing models accurately\ndetermine the distribution of the larger bubbles within our ${\\sim}6$ comoving\nMpc simulation box, but that these models fail to take into account\nself-shielded neutral gas in dense filaments. Thus, these prescriptions\noverestimate the fraction of halos in HII regions impacted by reionization\nfeedback by up to an order of magnitude (depending on halo mass and redshift).\nThis leads to an unrealistically large effect of reionization feedback on Pop\nIII stars and low-mass metal-enriched galaxies. Our newly developed model takes\ninto account the density structure of the cosmic web, leading to good agreement\nwith Renaissance in the fraction of halos found in ionized regions.",

These included the O I lines at 777.4 and 844.6 nm, the Na I\nlines at 818.3 and 819.5 nm, the [S I] lines at 458.9 and 772.5 nm, the S I\ntriplet at 922.3 nm, the [O II] lines at 732.0 and 733.0 nm and the [S II]\nlines at 406.9, 407.6, 671.6 and 673.1 nm. We leveraged these new detections by\ncomparing with imaging data from the 2001 Cassini flyby to better understand\nthe distribution of atmospheric species and their contribution to the observed\nauroral brightnesses. Our auroral emission model showed that the observed\n557.7, 777.4 and 844.6 nm oxygen emission line brightnesses could be explained\nby excitation by electron impact of canonical 5 eV torus electrons on an\natmosphere composed of O, SO2 and an isoelectronic proxy for SO. The SO2\nemission did not decrease immediately after eclipse ingress, suggesting the\nemitting column may be restricted to higher altitudes. The derived O/SO2 mixing\nratio was typically about 10%, but it also exhibited order-of-magnitude\nvariance during some observations. Io's 630.0 nm [O I] brightness did not\nstrongly vary with plasma sheet distance, suggesting electron flux at Io varies\nsubstantially beyond model predictions.",

Previous MHD\nsystems for planetary entry were either electrodeless global systems or\ntwo-electrode local systems. The proposed novel MHD system employs two magnets\nto establish a current loop resulting in a Faraday electromotive force (EMF).\nThe first magnet is positioned to ensure the magnetic field faces outward from\nthe shell, while the second magnet is oriented to ensure the magnetic field\nfaces inward toward the shell. Preliminary findings demonstrate that when\nlocated on the surface of an Earth entry capsule at a flight Mach number of 35,\nthe novel electrodeless MHD system can generate forces several times greater\nthan a two-electrode system while utilizing the same magnetic field strength.\nThe study is conducted entirely through numerical simulation using CFDWARP, a\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) code that employs advanced numerical methods\nallowing for the full coupling between aerodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and\nnon-neutral plasma sheaths.

Our key\ninnovation lies in privatizing the data knockoff matrix through the Gaussian\nJohnson-Lindenstrauss Transformation (JLT), a dimension reduction technique\nthat simultaneously preserves covariate relationships through approximate\nisometry for $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy.\n  We theoretically characterize both FDR and the power of the proposed private\nvariable selection procedure, in an asymptotic regime. Our theoretical analysis\ncharacterizes the role of different factors, such as the JLT's dimension\nreduction ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, differential privacy parameters, sample\nsize and feature dimension, in shaping the privacy-power trade-off. Our\nanalysis is based on a novel `debiasing technique' for high-dimensional private\nknockoff procedure.

Traditional methods, such as\nextreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency\ndomain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible\ninformation loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure\nfrequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image\nartifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these\nlimitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework\ndesigned for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary\nsub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination\nAdaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,\nutilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,\nwhich effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the\nother hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination\ndistortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global\ncontext provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely\nderaining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows\nthat it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

    "abstract": "TRAPPIST-1 is an M8 dwarf hosting seven known exoplanets and is currently one\nof the most frequently observed targets of the James Webb Space Telescope\n(JWST). However, it is notoriously active, and its surface is believed to be\ncovered by magnetic features that contaminate the planetary transmission\nspectra. The radiative spectra of these magnetic features are needed to clean\ntransmission spectra, but they currently remain unknown. Here, we develop a new\napproach for measuring these spectra using time-resolved JWST/NIRISS\nobservations. We detect a persistent post-flare enhancement in the spectral\nflux of TRAPPIST-1. Our analysis rules out lingering flare decay as the cause\nof the flux enhancement and, thus, points to structural changes on the stellar\nsurface induced by flares. We suggest that the flaring event triggers the\ndisappearance of (part of) a dark magnetic feature, producing a net\nbrightening. This suggestion is motivated by solar data: flare-induced\ndisappearance of magnetic features on the solar surface has been directly\ndetected in high spatial resolution images, and our analysis shows that this\nprocess produces changes in solar brightness very similar to those we observe\non TRAPPIST-1. The proposed explanation for the flux enhancement enables, to\nour knowledge, the first measurement of the spectrum of a magnetic feature on\nan M8 dwarf. Our analysis indicates that the disappearing magnetic feature is\ncooler than the TRAPPIST-1 photosphere, but by at most a few hundred kelvins.",

    "abstract": "The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the\nadoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling\ncollaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated\nRecommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle\nwith non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation\nquality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec)\nmethods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data\naccess, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that\nintegrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data\nwhile preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework\ndesigned to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict\nconstraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay\nMemory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on\nuser-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which\nintegrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in\nmaintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.",

Advanced\nfine-tuning with differential learning rates achieved substantial improvements:\nDenseNet121 (34.79% precision@10, 19.64% improvement) and ResNet50 (34.54%,\n19.58% improvement). Super-ensemble optimization combining complementary\narchitectures achieved 36.33% precision@10 (95% CI: [34.78%, 37.88%]),\nrepresenting 24.93% improvement over baseline and providing 3.6 relevant cases\nper query.

Tritium retention\ngenerates radioactive concerns and decreases the amount of fuel available to\ngenerate power. Hence, understanding the behavior of T in tungsten (W), as the\nmain candidate as armor material, is critical to the deployment of fusion as a\nreliable energy source. In this work, we have studied the effect of a thermal\ngradient in the transport properties of hydrogen (as a T surrogate) in pure W.\nStrong thermal gradients develop in the divertor as a result of the intense\nenergy fluxes arriving at the material. We have developed an analytical\napproach to compute the heat of transport ($Q^*$) that is parameterized from\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations. $Q^*$ is a parameter needed in\nirreversible thermodynamics frameworks to understand mass transport in the\npresence of thermal gradients. We show that $Q^*$ can be written as a function\nof temperature, temperature gradient, a characteristic length and the ratio of\nthe rates towards hot and cold regions. Furthermore, we describe how, to first\norder, the dependence of $Q^*$ on the thermal gradient vanishes, in agreement\nwith MD results. On average, we find $Q^*=-5.41\\times 10^{-3}kT^2~\\text{eV}$\nfor H in pure W, with $k$ the Boltzmann constant and $T$ the temperature.",

In the\ncontext of solid-state qubits, the quantum error correcting protocol operating\nin the presence of dead components should ideally (i) use the same native\noperation set as that without dead components, (ii) maximize salvaging of\nfunctional components, and (iii) use a consistent global operating schedule\nwhich optimizes logical qubit performance and is compatible with the control\nrequirements of the system. The scheme proposed by Grans-Samuelsson et al.\n[Quantum 8, 1429 (2024)] satisfies all three of these criteria: it effectively\nexcises (cuts out) dead components from the surface code using minimally\ninvasive alterations (MIA). We conduct extensive numerical simulations of this\nproposal for the pairwise-measurement-based surface code protocol in the\npresence of dead components under circuit-level noise. To that end, we also\ndescribe techniques to automatically construct performant check (detector)\nbases directly from circuits without manual circuit annotation, which may be of\nindependent interest. Both the MIA scheme and this automated check basis\ncomputation can be readily used with measurement-based as well as CNOT-based\ncircuits, and the results presented here demonstrate state-of-the-art\nperformance.",

In rare cases the SN\nejecta interact with circumstellar material (CSM) that was ejected from the\nprogenitor system prior to the SN. The unknown distance between the CSM and SN\nexplosion site makes it impossible to predict when the interaction will start.\nIf the time between the SN and start of CSM interaction is of the order of\nmonths to years the SN has generally faded and is not actively followed up\nanymore, making it even more difficult to detect the interaction while it\nhappens. Here we report on a real-time monitoring program which ran between\n13-11-2023 and 09-07-2024, monitoring 6914 SNe Ia for signs of late-time\nrebrightening using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Flagged candidates\nwere rapidly followed up with photometry and spectroscopy to confirm the\nlate-time excess and its position. We report the discovery of a $\\sim50$ day\nrebrightening event in SN 2020qxz around 1200 days after the peak of its light\ncurve. SN 2020qxz had signs of early CSM interaction but faded from view over 2\nyears before its reappearance. Follow-up spectroscopy revealed 4 emission lines\nthat faded shortly after the end of the ZTF detected rebrightening. Our best\nmatch for these emission lines are H$\\beta$ (blue shifted by $\\sim5900$ km\ns$^{-1}$) and CaII$_{\\lambda8542}$, NI$_{\\lambda8567}$, and KI$_{\\lambda\\lambda\n8763, 8767}$, all blue shifted by 5100 km s$^{-1}$ (although we note that these\nidentifications are uncertain). This shows that catching and following up on\nlate-time interactions as they occur can give new clues about the nature of the\nprogenitor systems that produce these SNe by putting constraints on the\npossible type of donor star, and the only way to do this systematically is to\nuse large sky surveys such as ZTF to monitor a large sample of objects.",

    "abstract": "Modelling perturbations of the Milky Way (MW) halo induced by the infall of\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) offers new avenues to constrain the dark\nmatter (DM) distribution in our Galaxy. A key observable is the reflex motion\nof the MW disc with respect to the halo induced by the LMC's infall, which\nimprints a velocity dipole on kinematics of halo stars. Here we investigate how\nthe dipole varies with Galactocentric radius, and study the sensitivity of the\nreflex motion signal to different DM outer-halo profiles. Using a suite of\nbasis function expansion (BFE) simulations with truncated NFW profiles ($\\rho\n\\propto r^{-\\beta}$ beyond $r=50$ kpc), our $N$-body models show that (i) The\nreflex motion amplitude varies with Galactocentric radius but is largely\ninsensitive to the outer DM slope, implying that the MW-LMC mass ratio alone\ndoes not set the dipole strength. (ii) In contrast, the direction of the disc\nmotion is very sensitive to the density distribution of the outer DM halo.\n(iii) The contraction of the MW halo induced by the LMC's gravitational pull\nalso depends strongly on the outer DM halo profile. (iv) We find a halo\ninstability whose oscillation frequency increases with $\\beta$ producing a\npotentially observable signature - a sinusoidal pattern of the mean radial\nvelocity of halo stars. Finally, using BFE coefficients we find that steeper\ntruncations produce smaller dipole distortions, while amplifying the quadrupole\ndistortion. These results highlight the limited constraining power of the\nreflex motion amplitude alone for outer MW profile parameters.",

Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily\nbased on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However,\nour data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission\nvolume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests.\nThis disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving\nthese communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim\nto propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both\nrestoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this\ngoal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair\ndurations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement\nlearning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine\nequity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize\nframework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized\nQuantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2)\nSpatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels\nacross regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that\nour EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and\ndecreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

Once a good\narrives, its true value for each agent is revealed, and it has to be\nimmediately and irrevocably allocated to some agent. The ultimate goal is to\nensure envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) after all goods have been allocated.\nUnfortunately, as we show, approximate EFX allocations are unattainable in\ngeneral, even under restrictive assumptions on the valuation functions.\n  To address this, we follow a recent and fruitful trend of augmenting\nalgorithms with predictions. Specifically, we assume access to a prediction\nvector estimating the agents' true valuations -- e.g., generated by a machine\nlearning model trained on past data. Predictions may be unreliable, and we\nmeasure their error using the total variation distance from the true\nvaluations, that is, the percentage of predicted value-mass that disagrees with\nthe true values.\n  Focusing on the natural class of additive valuations, we prove impossibility\nresults even on approximate EFX allocations for algorithms that either ignore\npredictions or rely solely on them. We then turn to algorithms that use both\nthe predictions and the true values and show strong lower bounds on the\nprediction accuracy that is required by any algorithm to compute an approximate\nEFX. These negative results persist even under identical valuations, contrary\nto the offline setting where exact EFX allocations always exist without the\nnecessity of predictions. We then present an algorithm for two agents with\nidentical valuations that uses effectively the predictions and the true values.\nThe algorithm approximates EFX, with its guarantees improving as the accuracy\nof the predictions increases.",

Our analysis reveals that the\nAGN in the BCG has recently awakened, showing a compact core with symmetric,\n~30 pc long jets in VLBA data. The onset of the AGN may be linked to the\nenhanced cooling of the hot gas found in a previous study. At larger scales (10\nkpc), faint radio whiskers extending to the south show a striking alignment\nwith star-forming knots and are thus interpreted as synchrotron-emitting\nregions associated with the starburst BCG. The implied radio star formation\nrate of 100 - 155 M$_{\\odot}$/yr agrees with the optical/infrared one (140 -\n190 M$_{\\odot}$/yr).

    "abstract": "Observations of distant galaxies suggest that the physics of galaxy formation\nat high redshifts differs significantly from later times. In contrast to large,\nsteady disk galaxies like the Milky Way, high-redshift galaxies are often\ncharacterized by clumpy, disturbed morphologies and bursty star formation\nhistories. These differences between low-mass, bursty galaxies and higher-mass,\nsteady star-forming galaxies have recently been studied in galaxy formation\nsimulations with resolved multiphase ISM. These simulation studies indicate\nthat while steady disk galaxies can be well-modeled as \"equilibrium disks\"\nembedded in a distinct, hot CGM, bursty galaxies are much more dynamic and\ntheir star formation occurs in a dispersion-dominated medium that extends to\nhalo scales, with no clear boundary between the ISM and the CGM. We develop an\nanalytic framework to model star formation in bursty galaxies that are not\nadequately modeled as equilibrium disks. The framework approximates the gas in\nlow-mass halos as a continuous, supersonically turbulent medium with large\ndensity fluctuations. Star formation occurs locally in the high-density tail of\na roughly lognormal density distribution. This is analogous to turbulent models\nof star formation in molecular clouds, but here applied on inner CGM scales. By\ncomparing with galaxy formation simulations from the FIRE project, we show that\nthis framework can be used to understand star formation efficiencies and radial\nprofiles in halos. The turbulent framework shows explicitly how the\ninstantaneous galaxy-averaged star formation efficiency can be relatively low\neven if the local efficiency in dense gas approaches unity.",

In the classical setting, linear\nprogramming (LP) decoders offer provable performance guarantees and can\nleverage fast practical optimization algorithms. Although LP decoders have been\nproposed for quantum codes, their performance and limitations remain relatively\nunderexplored. In this work, we uncover a key limitation of LP decoding for\nquantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes: certain constant-weight error\npatterns lead to ambiguous fractional solutions that cannot be resolved through\nindependent rounding. To address this issue, we incorporate a post-processing\ntechnique known as ordered statistics decoding (OSD), which significantly\nenhances LP decoding performance in practice. Our results show that LP\ndecoding, when augmented with OSD, can outperform belief propagation with the\nsame post-processing for intermediate code sizes of up to hundreds of qubits.\nThese findings suggest that LP-based decoders, equipped with effective\npost-processing, offer a promising approach for decoding near-term quantum LDPC\ncodes.",

The effects of\nfrustration and massive degeneracies at high energy, where the many-body\ndynamics becomes chaotic, have hitherto been far less explored. Here, we\nidentify a high-energy dynamical analog of highly-frustrated magnetism, in the\nform of an extensive manifold of classical ''interaction-suppressing''\nconfigurations giving rise to unstable periodic orbits. These are in general\nneither protected by symmetry nor integrability, and emerge from a set of\ndynamical local constraints that effectively nullify the interactions while\nallowing extensively many local degrees of freedom. The proliferation of\nunstable periodic orbits corresponds in the quantum case to ''hyperscarring'',\nthat is, quantum scarring on exponentially many unstable periodic orbits. On\nthe product states associated to the latter, the amplitudes of the mid-spectrum\nthermal eigenstates exhibit a power-law distribution, in stark contrast to the\nexpected exponential Porter-Thomas distribution that holds for generic product\nstates. Our results reveal a new constrained dynamical regime where many-body\nquantum chaos coexists with structured manifolds of coherent dynamics, and\nestablishes a mechanism for hitherto elusive extensive scarring.",

The effective dielectric permittivity of\nthe pressed HfxZr1-xO2 nanopowders has a pronounced maximum at 38 - 88 C, which\nshape can be fitted by the Curie-Weiss type dependence modified for the diffuse\nferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition. The maximal value of the\ndielectric permittivity increases from 1.5*10^3 (for x = 1) to 1.5*10^5 (for x=\n0.4) at low frequencies (~4 Hz); being much smaller, namely changing from 7\n(for x = 1) to 20 (for x = 0.4) at high frequencies (~500 kHz). The frequency\ndispersion of the dielectric permittivity maximum position is almost absent,\nmeanwhile the shape and width of the maximum changes in a complex way with\nincrease in frequency. The temperature dependencies of the dielectric\npermittivity and resistivity are almost mirror-like turned over in respect to\neach other, which means that all their features, such as position and shape of\nmaxima, plateau, minima and inflexions, almost coincide after the mirror\nreflection in respect to the temperature axis. These correlations of\nresistivity and dielectric permittivity are well-described in the Heywang\nbarrier model applied together with the variable range hopping conduction model\nin semiconducting ferroelectrics. The ferroelectric-like behavior of the\ndielectric permittivity is explained by the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach\nand density functional theory calculations, which reveal that small HfxZr1-xO2\nnanoparticles can become ferroelectric in the presence of oxygen vacancies.\nObtained results may be useful for developing silicon-compatible ferroelectric\nnanomaterials based on HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles.",

Slab model fits to the average spectra show that the\nVLMS H$_2$O emission is quite similar in temperature and column density to a\nwarm ($\\sim$600 K) H$_2$O component in the T Tauri spectrum, indicating that\nthe high C/O gas phase ratio in these disks is not due to oxygen depletion\nalone. Instead, the presence of many hydrocarbons, including some with high\ncolumn densities, points to carbon enhancement in the disks around VLMS.

The high power of such outbursts causes\ndramatic changes in the physical and chemical structure of a surrounding\nprotoplanetary disk. As characteristic thermal timescales in the disk are\ncomparable to the duration of the outburst, the response of its thermal\nstructure is inherently time dependent.\n  Aims. We analyzed how the disk thermal structure evolves under the\nsubstantial-yet transient-eating of the outburst. To cover different possible\nphysical mechanisms driving the outburst, we examined two scenarios: one in\nwhich the increased accretion rate is confined to a compact sub-au inner region\nand the other where it affects the entire disk.\n  Methods. To model the disk temperature response to the outburst we performed\ntime-dependent radiation transfer using the HURAKAN code. The disk structure\nand the luminosity profile roughly correspond to those of the FU Ori system\nitself, which went into outburst about 90 years ago and reached a luminosity of\n450 L_Sun.\n  Results. We find that optically thick disk regions require several years to\nbecome fully heated during the outburst and a decade to cool after it. The\nupper layers and outer parts of the disk, which are optically thin to thermal\nradiation, are heated and cooled almost instantaneously. This creates an\nunusual radial temperature profile during the early heating phase with minima\nat several au both for the fully active and compact active disk scenarios. At\nthe cooling phase, upper layers being colder than the midplane for both\nscenarios. Near- and mid-infrared SEDs demonstrate a significant and almost\ninstantaneous rise by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude during the outburst, while the\nmillimeter flux shows a change of only a factor of a few, and is slightly\ndelayed with respect to the central region luminosity profile.",

To address this limitation, we propose\nANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under\nsuch perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by\nfusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered\nto form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt\ntokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper\nlayers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware\nvisual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype\n(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,\nANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by\ncomputing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard\ncross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that\nANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving\nsuperior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel\ncategories.",

However, continual fine-tuning\nLLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,\ncharacterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and\n2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously\naddress both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample\nReplay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient\nanti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices\nunder GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced\nactivation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin\n(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.\nWe are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general\nreplay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general\ncapabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.\nIndeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled\nexperiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies\nunder the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via\nKL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that\nTM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work\npaves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future.

One key challenge of such environments is the ability of actors to\ncreate fake identities under fictitious false names, also known as ``Sybils.''\nWhile some actors may do so to preserve their privacy, we show that this can\ninadvertently hamper inequality measurements. As we prove, it is impossible for\nmeasures satisfying the literature's canonical set of desired properties to\nassess the inequality of an economy that may harbor Sybils. We characterize the\nclass of all Sybil-proof measures, and prove that they must satisfy relaxed\nversion of the aforementioned properties. Furthermore, we show that the\nstructure imposed restricts the ability to assess inequality at a fine-grained\nlevel. By applying our results, we prove that large classes of popular measures\nare not Sybil-proof, with the famous Gini coefficient being but one example out\nof many.

In this paper, we present\nHierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:\nDM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish\nsemantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.\nHierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical\nPosition Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks\nbased on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which\nsystematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic\nstructural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts\nknowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity\nvariations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models\ninto a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the\nquality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight\nquantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction\n(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on\nserver and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score\nand 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model.

Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that\nenables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs.\nFurthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD)\nsegmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual\nprompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative\ncapabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present\na unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets.\nExperimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its\nefficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding.

This work presents a novel computational\nimaging approach to overcome this tradeoff by leveraging the existing adaptive\noptics (AO) systems in modern ground-based telescopes. Our key idea is to use\nthe AO system's deformable mirror to apply a series of learned, precisely\ncontrolled distortions to the optical wavefront, producing a sequence of images\nthat exhibit distinct, high-frequency, sub-pixel shifts. These images can then\nbe jointly upsampled to yield the final super-resolved image. Crucially, we\nshow this can be done while simultaneously maintaining the core AO\noperation--correcting for the unknown and rapidly changing wavefront\ndistortions caused by Earth's atmosphere. To achieve this, we incorporate\nend-to-end optimization of both the induced mirror distortions and the\nupsampling algorithm, such that telescope-specific optics and temporal\nstatistics of atmospheric wavefront distortions are accounted for. Our\nexperimental results with a hardware prototype, as well as simulations,\ndemonstrate significant SNR improvements of up to 12 dB over non-AO\nsuper-resolution baselines, using only existing telescope optics and no\nhardware modifications. Moreover, by using a precise bench-top replica of a\ncomplete telescope and AO system, we show that our methodology can be readily\ntransferred to an operational telescope.

They provide a means of thermodynamic inference in the\ntypical situation, when not all dissipative degrees of freedom in a system are\nexperimentally accessible. So far, theories focusing on path-wise observables\nhave been developing in two major directions, diffusion processes and\nMarkov-jump dynamics, in a virtually disjoint manner. Moreover, even the\nrespective results for diffusion and jump dynamics were derived with a\npatchwork of different approaches that are predominantly indirect. Stochastic\ncalculus was recently shown to provide a direct approach to path-wise\nobservables of diffusion processes, while a corresponding framework for jump\ndynamics remained elusive. In our work we develop, in an exact parallelism with\ncontinuous-space diffusion, a complete stochastic calculus for path-wise\nobservables of Markov-jump processes. We formulate a \"Langevin equation\" for\njump processes, define general path-wise observables, and establish their\ncovariation structure, whereby we fully account for transients and\ntime-inhomogeneous dynamics. We prove the known kinds of thermodynamic\ninequalities in their most general form and discus saturation conditions. We\ndetermine the response of path-wise observables to general (incl. thermal)\nperturbations and carry out the continuum limit to achieve the complete\nunification of diffusion and jump dynamics. Our results open new avenues in the\ndirection of discrete-state analogs of generative diffusion models and the\nlearning of stochastic thermodynamics from fluctuating trajectories.",

    "abstract": "The Lasso method is known to exhibit instability in the presence of highly\ncorrelated features, often leading to an arbitrary selection of predictors.\nThis issue manifests itself in two primary error types: the erroneous omission\nof features that lack a true substitutable relationship (falsely redundant\nfeatures) and the inclusion of features with a true substitutable relationship\n(truly redundant features). Although most existing methods address only one of\nthese challenges, we introduce the Accept-Reject Lasso (ARL), a novel approach\nthat resolves this dilemma. ARL operationalizes an Accept-Reject framework\nthrough a fine-grained analysis of feature selection across data subsets. This\nframework is designed to partition the output of an ensemble method into\nbeneficial and detrimental components through fine-grained analysis. The\nfundamental challenge for Lasso is that inter-variable correlation obscures the\ntrue sources of information. ARL tackles this by first using clustering to\nidentify distinct subset structures within the data. It then analyzes Lasso's\nbehavior across these subsets to differentiate between true and spurious\ncorrelations. For truly correlated features, which induce multicollinearity,\nARL tends to select a single representative feature and reject the rest to\nensure model stability. Conversely, for features linked by spurious\ncorrelations, which may vanish in certain subsets, ARL accepts those that Lasso\nmight have incorrectly omitted. The distinct patterns arising from true versus\nspurious correlations create a divisible separation. By setting an appropriate\nthreshold, our framework can effectively distinguish between these two\nphenomena, thereby maximizing the inclusion of informative variables while\nminimizing the introduction of detrimental ones. We illustrate the efficacy of\nthe proposed method through extensive simulation and real-data experiments.",

Previous demonstrations of indefinite causal order have relied on a\nprocess known as quantum switch and depended on specific assumptions about the\ndevices used in the laboratory. Recently, a theoretical scheme for the\ncertification of indefinite causal order in the quantum switch has been\nobtained solely from the output statistics of the devices, analogous to the\ndevice-independent proofs of nonlocality through violations of the Bell\ninequality. Here, we report an experimental verification of the causal\ninequality using spacelike-separated entangled photons, where one photon\nfunctions as the control qubit in a quantum switch and the other serves as an\nadditional observer. Through local measurement statistics, we observe a\nviolation of the causal inequality by 24 standard deviations.

    "abstract": "Cross-chain asset exchange is crucial for blockchain interoperability.\nExisting solutions rely on trusted third parties and risk asset loss, or use\ndecentralized alternatives like atomic swaps, which suffer from grief attacks.\nGriefing occurs when a party prematurely exits, locking the counterparty's\nassets until a timelock expires. Hedged Atomic Swaps mitigate griefing by\nintroducing a penalty premium; however, they increase the number of\ntransactions from four (as in Tier Nolan's swap) to six, which in turn\nintroduces new griefing risks. Grief-Free (GF) Swap reduces this to five\ntransactions by consolidating assets and premiums on a single chain. However,\nno existing protocol achieves grief-free asset exchange in just four\ntransactions.\n  This paper presents 4-Swap, the first cross-chain atomic swap protocol that\nis both grief-free and bribery-safe, while completing asset exchange in just\nfour transactions. By combining the griefing premium and principal into a\nsingle transaction per chain, 4-Swap reduces on-chain transactions, leading to\nfaster execution compared to previous grief-free solutions. It is fully\ncompatible with Bitcoin and operates without the need for any new opcodes. A\ngame-theoretic analysis shows that rational participants have no incentive to\ndeviate from the protocol, ensuring robust compliance and security.",

When $n=2$, we show these subsets are the same, and in\nthis case give a single criterion in terms of the entries of a tensor for\nmembership in the orbits of these subsets.

Recently, meta-analytic models have been\nemployed to evaluate whether late-stage cancer incidence can serve as a\nsurrogate for cancer mortality in cancer screening trials. A major challenge in\nmeta-analytic models is that uncertainty of trial-level estimates affects the\nevaluation of surrogacy, since each trial provides only estimates of the\nprimary and surrogate endpoints rather than their true parameter values. In\nthis work, we show via simulation and theory that trial-level estimate\nuncertainty may bias the results of meta-analytic models towards positive\nfindings of the quality of the surrogate. We focus on cancer screening trials\nand the late stage incidence surrogate. We reassess correlations between\nprimary and surrogate endpoints in Ovarian cancer screening trials.

However, most existing\nmulti-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with\nsophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less\ncapable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we\nintroduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables\nnative end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent\nsystem (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple\nagents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model\ndynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate\nmulti-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end\nchain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent\ndistillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into\nchain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use\nagentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve\nthe models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving.

To address the resulting \\mbox{nonconvex problems}, we\nfirst utilize a penalty-based successive convex approximation technique with a\nfully-digital beamformer to obtain a suboptimal solution. Then, we propose an\nefficient alternating \\mbox{optimization} algorithm to design the\nanalog-and-digital beamformer. \\mbox{Simulation} results indicate that joint\ndistance-and-angle estimation is feasible in the near-field region. However,\nthe adopted hybrid architectures inevitably degrade the accuracy of distance\nestimation, compared with their fully-digital counterparts. Furthermore,\nenhancements in system EE would compromise the accuracy of target estimation,\nunveiling a nontrivial tradeoff.",

    "abstract": "When dust particles are immersed in a plasma, and the power that sustains a\nplasma is terminated, the charge of dust particles will change in the early\nafterglow, as electrons and ions gradually diminish in number. The possibility\nof controlling this charge, along with the electric force acting on the\nparticles in the late afterglow, has earlier been demonstrated at a low gas\npressure of 8 mTorr. Here, it is confirmed experimentally that controlling\nparticles is possible also at a higher gas pressure of 90 mTorr, in a\ncapacitively coupled radio-frequency plasma (CCP). A timed application of a DC\nelectric field during the afterglow is a key element of this control scheme.\nAnalyzing the experimental results, the electric force in the late afterglow\nwas determined by comparing measurements of particle velocity to a prediction\nmade by integrating the equation of motion, taking into account gas friction.\nIn addition to applying friction to dust particles, gas also slows the drifting\nmotion of electrons and ions, reducing their energy during the afterglow, but\nnevertheless we find that dust particles become charged in the afterglow so\nthat one can apply an electric force to them that is comparable to the\ngravitational force, even at a higher pressure than had previously been\ndemonstrated. This result extends the parameter range for which it is expected\nthat particle contamination in semiconductor manufacturing can be mitigated by\ncontrolling charge and forces during the afterglow. Because of the way that\nforces scale with particle size, it is expected that submicron particles can be\ncontrolled even more easily than the larger spheres in the present experiment.",

Recently, generative recommendation\nhas emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional\nretrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic\ngeneration. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained\nby their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from\ntwo critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking\na coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement\n(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that\nlearns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core\ninnovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization\nprocess that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more\nuniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict\nhierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for\neach recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE\nincorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space\noverlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but\nalso promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive\nutilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled\nIDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models.

This tendency can have an influence\non various properties of the network, such as its robustness or the dynamics of\nspreading processes. In this paper, we study degree assortativity both in\nreal-world networks and in several generative models for networks with\nheavy-tailed degree distribution based on latent spaces. In particular, we\nstudy Chung-Lu Graphs and Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs).\n  Previous research on assortativity has primarily focused on measuring the\ndegree assortativity in real-world networks using the Pearson assortativity\ncoefficient, despite reservations against this coefficient. We rigorously\nconfirm these reservations by mathematically proving that the Pearson\nassortativity coefficient does not measure assortativity in any network with\nsufficiently heavy-tailed degree distributions, which is typical for real-world\nnetworks. Moreover, we find that other single-valued assortativity coefficients\nalso do not sufficiently capture the wiring preferences of nodes, which often\nvary greatly by node degree. We therefore take a more fine-grained approach,\nanalyzing a wide range of conditional and joint weight and degree distributions\nof connected nodes, both numerically in real-world networks and mathematically\nin the generative graph models. We provide several methods of visualizing the\nresults.\n  We show that the generative models are assortativity-neutral, while many\nreal-world networks are not. Therefore, we also propose an extension of the\nGIRG model which retains the manifold desirable properties induced by the\ndegree distribution and the latent space, but also exhibits tunable\nassortativity. We analyze the resulting model mathematically, and give a\nfine-grained quantification of its assortativity.",

Multimodal deep neural networks (MDNN) have the capability\nof integrating diverse data domains and offer a promising solution for robust\nand accurate predictions. However, the optimal fusion strategy, intermediate\nfusion (feature-level) versus late fusion (decision-level) remains\ninsufficiently examined, especially in high-stakes clinical contexts such as\nECG-based cardiovascular disease (CVD) classification. This study investigates\nthe comparative effectiveness of intermediate and late fusion strategies using\nECG signals across three domains: time, frequency, and time-frequency.

Results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently\noutperformed late fusion, achieving a peak accuracy of 97 percent, with Cohen's\nd > 0.8 relative to standalone models and d = 0.40 compared to late fusion.\nInterpretability analyses using saliency maps reveal that both models align\nwith the discretized ECG signals.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a rigorous derivation of an effective model for fluid\nflow through a thin elastic porous membrane separating two fluid bulk domains.\nThe microscopic setting involves a periodically structured porous membrane\ncomposed of a solid phase and fluid-filled pores, with thickness and\nperiodicity of order $\\varepsilon$, small compared to the size of the bulk\nregions. The microscopic model is governed by a coupled fluid-structure\ninteraction system: instationary Stokes equations for the fluid and linear\nelasticity for the solid, with two distinct scalings of the elastic stress\ntensor yielding different effective behaviors.\n  Using two-scale convergence techniques adapted to thin domains and\noscillatory microstructures, the membrane is reduced to an effective interface\nacross which transmission conditions are derived. The resulting macroscopic\nmodel couples the bulk fluid domains via effective interface laws of\nNavier-slip-type including the dynamic displacement. The character of this\ncoupling depends critically on the choice of the scaling in the elastic stress\ntensor, leading to either a membrane equation or a Kirchhoff-Love plate\nequation for the effective displacement. The resulting interface conditions\nnaturally admit mass exchange between the adjacent fluid regions. In the\nanalytical framework, a new two-scale compactness theorem for the symmetric\ngradient is established, underpinning the passage to the limit in the coupled\nsystem.

This type of electronic state\nis particularly important for the photochemistry of molecules containing\ncarbonyl groups, such as atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The\noscillator strength characterizing a dark transition can change dramatically by\na slight alteration of the molecular geometry around its ground-state\nequilibrium, the so-called non-Condon effects. Hence, testing the performance\nof electronic-structure methods for dark transitions requires considering\nmolecules at their Franck-Condon point (i.e., equilibrium geometry), but also\nbeyond the Franck-Condon point. Our benchmark focuses on various\nelectronic-structure methods - LR-TDDFT(/TDA), ADC(2), CC2, EOM-CCSD, CC2/3,\nXMS-CASPT2 - with CC3/aug-cc-pVTZ serving as a theoretical best estimate.

Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time\nneeds and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated\ncontent like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static\npages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such\ntime-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static\ncontent, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like\ndatabases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA\n(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage\nframework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content\nand dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an\nIntent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information\nsources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task\nPlanner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for\noptimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for\nefficient tool calling.

The analysis is conducted within a photonic\ncrystal framework using COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2 to study the resonant modes of\nthe all-dielectric metamaterial. Our results confirm the existence of an\nnear-zero effective refractive index (NZERI) regime at the\n$\\Gamma\\text{-point}$ point in the photonic crystal approach. At this NZERI\nregime a consequence of triply degenerate eigenmodes in a certain frequency\nrange occurs when the effective refractive index of the metasurface approaches\nzero. Our central idea is that the NZERI regime in the all-dielectric\nmetasurface of a graphene substrate can be used to control, enhance, and modify\nthe propagation of SPPs. We applied several independent theoretical methods to\nobtain the effective refractive index of the metasurface at NZERI frequency\nrange for two-dimensional and three-dimensional metasurface structures with a\ngraphene layer. Simulation results demonstrate that the effective permittivity\nand permeability simultaneously attain near-zero values at closely spaced yet\ndistinct frequencies, thereby establishing spectral regions with an effectively\nvanishing refractive index. Key contributions include the first demonstration\nof NZERI metasurfaces as graphene-supporting platforms for enhancing SPPs, a\nquantitative approach to balancing propagation distance and field confinement,\nand practical design guidelines that align with current nanofabrication\ncapabilities.

This trend is in contrast with that of the nearby molecular clouds,\nwhere the relative orientation transitions from parallel to perpendicular with\nincreasing column densities. However, the relative orientation varies between\nindividual CMZ clouds. Comparisons with MHD simulations specific to the CMZ\nconditions suggest that the observed parallel alignment is intrinsic rather\nthan artifacts caused by the projection effect. The origin of this parallel\nconfiguration may arise from the fact that most dense structures in the CMZ are\nnot self-gravitating, as they are in super-virial states, except for the\nmini-starburst region Sgr B2. These findings are consistent with the low star\nformation efficiency observed in the CMZ compared to that in the Galactic disk.",

However,\nexisting navigation tasks primarily focus on predefined object navigation or\ninstruction following, which significantly differs from human needs in\nreal-world scenarios involving complex, open-ended scenes. To bridge this gap,\nwe introduce a challenging long-horizon navigation task that requires\nunderstanding high-level human instructions and performing spatial-aware object\nnavigation in real-world environments. Existing embodied navigation methods\nstruggle with such tasks due to their limitations in comprehending high-level\nhuman instructions and localizing objects with an open vocabulary. In this\npaper, we propose $NavA^3$, a hierarchical framework divided into two stages:\nglobal and local policies. In the global policy, we leverage the reasoning\ncapabilities of Reasoning-VLM to parse high-level human instructions and\nintegrate them with global 3D scene views. This allows us to reason and\nnavigate to regions most likely to contain the goal object. In the local\npolicy, we have collected a dataset of 1.0 million samples of spatial-aware\nobject affordances to train the NaviAfford model (PointingVLM), which provides\nrobust open-vocabulary object localization and spatial awareness for precise\ngoal identification and navigation in complex environments. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that $NavA^3$ achieves SOTA results in navigation\nperformance and can successfully complete longhorizon navigation tasks across\ndifferent robot embodiments in real-world settings, paving the way for\nuniversal embodied navigation.

However, with the rapid increase in data volume, sending all\ndata to the cloud via the Internet has become more expensive. The required\ncloud computing resources have also become larger. To solve this problem, edge\ncomputing is proposed. Edge is granted with more computation power to process\ndata before sending it to the cloud. Therefore, the data transmitted over the\nInternet and the computing resources required by the cloud can be effectively\nreduced. In this work, we proposed an Edge-assisted Parallel Uncertain Skyline\n(EPUS) algorithm for emerging low-latency IoE analytic applications. We use the\nconcept of skyline candidate set to prune data that are less likely to become\nthe skyline data on the parallel edge computing nodes. With the candidate\nskyline set, each edge computing node only sends the information required to\nthe server for updating the global skyline, which reduces the amount of data\nthat transfer over the internet. According to the simulation results, the\nproposed method is better than two comparative methods, which reduces the\nlatency of processing two-dimensional data by more than 50%.

    "abstract": "Resistance spot welding is the dominant joining process for the body-in-white\nin the automotive industry, where the weld nugget diameter is the key quality\nmetric. Its measurement requires destructive testing, limiting the potential\nfor efficient quality control. Physics-informed neural networks were\ninvestigated as a promising tool to reconstruct internal process states from\nexperimental data, enabling model-based and non-invasive quality assessment in\naluminum spot welding. A major challenge is the integration of real-world data\ninto the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we\nintroduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic\ndisplacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in\nfunction to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a\ncustom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to\ncounteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we\nintroduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via\na look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure\nphysically meaningful temperatures. An axially symmetric two-dimensional model\nwas selected to represent the welding process accurately while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency. To reduce computational burden, the training\nstrategies and model components were first systematically evaluated in one\ndimension, enabling controlled analysis of loss design and contact models. The\ntwo-dimensional network predicts dynamic displacement and nugget growth within\nthe experimental confidence interval, supports transferring welding stages from\nsteel to aluminum, and demonstrates strong potential for fast, model-based\nquality control in industrial applications.",

We discover that graph structures provide more consistent\ncross-domain information compared to node features and graph labels. However,\ntraditional GFMs primarily focus on transferring node features from various\ndomains into a unified representation space but often lack structural\ncross-domain generalization. To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which\nemphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp\nconsists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting\ngraph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend\nonly on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the\ngraph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract\nstructural information and provide discriminative graph representations\ncomparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the\nrepresentations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a\ncomprehensive GFM. This phase utilizes domain-specific node attributes and\ngraph labels to further improve cross-domain node feature generalization. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that GraphProp significantly outperforms the\ncompetitors in supervised learning and few-shot learning, especially in\nhandling graphs without node attributes.",

The systems of\nequations describing the linearised perturbations can always be separated, but\nthey can only be decoupled when the three parameters are restricted to a\n1-parameter family of EMDA theories, characterised by a parameter $b$ that\ndetermines the coupling of the axion to the $\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}\\,\nF_{\\mu\\nu}\\, F_{\\rho\\sigma}$ term. In the specific case when $b=1$, the theory\nis related to an ${\\cal N}=2$ supergravity.

This\ntransformation is of a form found in supersymmetric quantum mechanical models.\nThe existence of such mappings between the axial and polar perturbations\nappears to correlate with those cases where there is an underlying supergravity\nsupporting the solution, even though the black hole backgrounds are\nnon-extremal and therefore not supersymmetric.

The Robust Coefficient of Variation (RCV) indicated smoother in\nvivo estimates for D* with MDNs compared to Gaussian model.

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences are essential for advancing\nresearch, sharing knowledge, and fostering academic community. However, their\nrapid expansion has rendered the centralized conference model increasingly\nunsustainable. This paper offers a data-driven diagnosis of a structural crisis\nthat threatens the foundational goals of scientific dissemination, equity, and\ncommunity well-being. We identify four key areas of strain: (1) scientifically,\nwith per-author publication rates more than doubling over the past decade to\nover 4.5 papers annually; (2) environmentally, with the carbon footprint of a\nsingle conference exceeding the daily emissions of its host city; (3)\npsychologically, with 71% of online community discourse reflecting negative\nsentiment and 35% referencing mental health concerns; and (4) logistically,\nwith attendance at top conferences such as NeurIPS 2024 beginning to outpace\nvenue capacity. These pressures point to a system that is misaligned with its\ncore mission. In response, we propose the Community-Federated Conference (CFC)\nmodel, which separates peer review, presentation, and networking into globally\ncoordinated but locally organized components, offering a more sustainable,\ninclusive, and resilient path forward for AI research.",

    "abstract": "Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) is a key task in the user-agent\ninteraction area, aiming to generate more expressive and empathetic speech for\nusers. However, it is well-known that \"listening\" and \"eye contact\" play\ncrucial roles in conveying emotions during real-world interpersonal\ncommunication. Existing CSS research is limited to perceiving only text and\nspeech within the dialogue context, which restricts its effectiveness.\nMoreover, speech-only responses further constrain the interactive experience.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce a Conversational Speech-Visual\nSynthesis (CSVS) task as an extension of traditional CSS. By leveraging\nmultimodal dialogue context, it provides users with coherent audiovisual\nresponses. To this end, we develop a CSVS system named UniTalker, which is a\nunified model that seamlessly integrates multimodal perception and multimodal\nrendering capabilities. Specifically, it leverages a large-scale language model\nto comprehensively understand multimodal cues in the dialogue context,\nincluding speaker, text, speech, and the talking-face animations. After that,\nit employs multi-task sequence prediction to first infer the target utterance's\nemotion and then generate empathetic speech and natural talking-face\nanimations. To ensure that the generated speech-visual content remains\nconsistent in terms of emotion, content, and duration, we introduce three key\noptimizations: 1) Designing a specialized neural landmark codec to tokenize and\nreconstruct facial expression sequences. 2) Proposing a bimodal speech-visual\nhard alignment decoding strategy. 3) Applying emotion-guided rendering during\nthe generation stage. Comprehensive objective and subjective experiments\ndemonstrate that our model synthesizes more empathetic speech and provides\nusers with more natural and emotionally consistent talking-face animations.",

Inspired by\ndictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight\nsharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection\nmatrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's\nparameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods\nrequiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in\nAttention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers\n- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix\natoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves\nbetter benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),\nlow-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at\ncomparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the\ndictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing\ncross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),\nMASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks\nwith 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning\nstrategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for\nparameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we\ninvestigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce\ntheir number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their\nperformance.",

In the clean limit, the AAH model undergoes a localization\ntransition from an extended phase to a localized phase via an intermediate\ncritical phase as the strength of the quasiperiodic potential is varied. While\nthe staggered potential merely shifts the critical point to a lower value,\nFibonacci and Thue-Morse potentials induce immediate localization. This\ncontrast reveals the sensitivity of localization behavior to the structural\ncomplexity of the potential, with the onset of localization correlating with\nthe sequence's complexity. More specifically, the system follows a hierarchy\ndefined by the complexity measures of the applied potentials. In addition, the\ntypical fidelity susceptibility exhibits a power-law scaling behavior at the\nlocalization transition, enabling reliable extraction of the critical exponent.\nWe focus on the AAH model with the Fibonacci potential due to its minimal\nfinite-size effects compared to other cases. For the disordered AAH model with\nthe Fibonacci potential, we determine critical exponents that differ from those\nof the AAH model without disorder and the Anderson model. Moreover, despite\ndifferences in localization behavior, we find that the disordered AAH models\nwith the staggered potential and the Fibonacci potential share the same\ncorrelation-length critical exponent.

To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Knowledge to Sight\n(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by\ndecomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as\nshape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from\ndomain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which\nguide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level\nsupervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial\nstructure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact\nmodels with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\\% of the data required by\nstate-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training\ndata, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical\nVLMs, with up to 9.82\\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$.

While\neffective, it remains unclear whether their gains stem from true multimodal\nunderstanding or increased model complexity. This work investigates the role of\nmultimodal item embeddings, emphasizing the semantic informativeness of the\nrepresentations. Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard\nextractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on\nmodality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over\ncross-modal alignment. To overcome these limitations, we leverage Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via\nstructured prompts. This approach yields semantically aligned representations\nwithout requiring any fusion. Experiments across multiple settings show notable\nperformance improvements. Furthermore, LVLMs embeddings offer a distinctive\nadvantage: they can be decoded into structured textual descriptions, enabling\ndirect assessment of their multimodal comprehension. When such descriptions are\nincorporated as side content into recommender systems, they improve\nrecommendation performance, empirically validating the semantic depth and\nalignment encoded within LVLMs outputs. Our study highlights the importance of\nsemantically rich representations and positions LVLMs as a compelling\nfoundation for building robust and meaningful multimodal representations in\nrecommendation tasks.",

    "abstract": "As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal\ncapabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from\nthe hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual\ninput. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of\ntraining data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which\nconsists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs\nwith certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we\nfind that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage\ntheir training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during\ntraining. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often\nincorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand\nthis issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,\nrevealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling\n(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and\nlightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via\ntraining bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between\nground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias\nand adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only\nupdates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\\%\nof the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both\ndiscriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong\nscalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data\nvolume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond\nobject-level hallucination.

However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance\non exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability\nto handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality\nin real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments\nworn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically\nrestricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce\n\\textbf{OMFA} (\\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for\nboth virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition\ngarments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing\ngarments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target\nperson (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel\nposes-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built\nupon a novel \\emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise\nand denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,\nthe person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient\nbidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely\nmask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,\nmaking it well-suited for real-world applications.

    "abstract": "Tidal and riverine hydrokinetic turbines offer promising solutions for\nrenewable energy generation in aquatic environments. However, their ecological\nimpact, especially on fish behavior, warrants a thorough investigation. This\nstudy presents an integrated experimental and computational analysis of fish\nturbine interactions, combining laboratory observations with high fidelity\nlarge eddy simulations. The simulations capture essential flow features,\nincluding wake asymmetry, vortex shedding, and spatial variations in turbulence\nintensity, under varying flow and rotational regimes of a geometry resolved\nvertical axis turbine. Behavioral experiments with rainbow trout reveal a\nconsistent tendency to avoid high turbulence and high shear regions, favoring\nlow turbulence zones such as downstream sidewalls. Hydrodynamic stressors and\nenergetic demands were characterized using turbulence metrics, including\nturbulence kinetic energy, Reynolds stress, and integral length scale, along\nwith estimations of fish generated thrust force. Our results demonstrate that\nturbine induced turbulence significantly influences fish movement and habitat\nselection, highlighting the need to consider behavioral responses in\nconventional fish injury assessment frameworks. These findings provide critical\ninsights for designing and operating hydrokinetic turbines in ecologically\nsensitive waters, ensuring a balance between renewable energy extraction and\naquatic ecosystem protection.",

In this paper, we study the afterglows of\nthese GRBs - namely GRB 180720B, GRB 190114C, GRB 190829A, GRB 201216C, and GRB\n221009A - modeling their synchrotron and inverse Compton emission within the\nframework of an optimized relativistic fireball model. We constrain the model\nparameters and their temporal evolution by applying our theoretical model to\nthe high-energy emission in the X-ray and GeV-TeV energy bands observed at\nintermediate and late times. Our results reveal interesting differences among\nthe TeV-detected GRBs, potentially reflecting a variety of underlying physical\nprocesses that lead to different maximum energies $E_{\\text{max}}= \\,\n\\gamma_{\\text{max}}\\, m_e \\, c^2$ of the accelerated particles responsible for\nthe GRB high-energy emission.

We find two intertwined $s_{\\pm}$-wave\nsuperconductivities with distinct physical origins under enhanced Hund's\ncoupling $J_H$. We show that when $d_{z^2}$ orbital is half-filled and its\nbonding band lies below Fermi level, electron pairing associated to $J_H$\nprevails. As $d_{z^2}$ orbital is hole-doped, this superconducting state\nbecomes suppressed and a second superconductivity, which is largely insensitive\nto $J_H$ but exhibiting a critical reliance on $d_{z^2}$ - $d_{x^2-y^2}$\nhybridization $V$, arises. These two pairing states exhibit comparable maximum\ntransition temperatures and evolve continuously from one to the other with\nvarying $d_{z^2}$ doping, resulting a smooth $T_c$ versus doping evolution.

In this surgery cardiac tissues are locally scarred on purpose to\nprevent electrical signals from causing arrhythmia. Patient-specific cardiac\ndigital twin models show great potential for personalized ablation therapy,\nhowever, they demand accurate semantic segmentation of healthy and scarred\ntissue typically obtained from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic\nresonance (MR) scans. In this work we propose the Left Atrial Cascading\nRefinement CNN (LA-CaRe-CNN), which aims to accurately segment the left atrium\nas well as left atrial scar tissue from LGE MR scans. LA-CaRe-CNN is a 2-stage\nCNN cascade that is trained end-to-end in 3D, where Stage 1 generates a\nprediction for the left atrium, which is then refined in Stage 2 in conjunction\nwith the original image information to obtain a prediction for the left atrial\nscar tissue. To account for domain shift towards domains unknown during\ntraining, we employ strong intensity and spatial augmentation to increase the\ndiversity of the training dataset. Our proposed method based on a 5-fold\nensemble achieves great segmentation results, namely, 89.21% DSC and 1.6969 mm\nASSD for the left atrium, as well as 64.59% DSC and 91.80% G-DSC for the more\nchallenging left atrial scar tissue.

Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the\nmodel to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are\nstreaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient\nto store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to\nstore recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating\nwhether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target\nevent. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain\nlong-term historical information, leading to low performance.

    "abstract": "Socioeconomic deprivation is a key determinant of public health, as\nhighlighted by the Scottish Government's Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation\n(SIMD). We propose an approach for clustering Scottish zones based on multiple\ndeprivation indicators using vine mixture models. This framework uses the\nflexibility of vine copulas to capture tail dependent and asymmetric\nrelationships among the indicators. From the fitted vine mixture model, we\nobtain posterior probabilities for each zone's membership in clusters. This\nallows the construction of a cluster-driven deprivation ranking by sorting\nzones according to their probability of belonging to the most deprived cluster.\nTo assess variable importance in this unsupervised learning setting, we adopt a\nleave-one-variable-out procedure by refitting the model without each variable\nand calculating the resulting change in the Bayesian information criterion. Our\nanalysis of 21 continuous indicators across 1964 zones in Glasgow and the\nsurrounding areas in Scotland shows that socioeconomic measures, particularly\nincome and employment rates, are major drivers of deprivation, while certain\nhealth- and crime-related indicators appear less influential. These findings\nare consistent across the approach of variable importance and the analysis of\nthe fitted vine structures of the identified clusters.",

In this paper, we aim to unveil the\nlandscape of clinical depression assessment. We introduce C-MIND, a clinical\nneuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from\nreal hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric\ntasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative\naudio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)\nsignals recorded. Using C-MIND, we first analyze behavioral signatures relevant\nto diagnosis. We train a range of classical models to quantify how different\ntasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the\neffectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform\npsychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in\nrealistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning\nprocess with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic\nperformance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. We aim to build an infrastructure\nfor clinical depression assessment from both data and algorithmic perspectives,\nenabling C-MIND to facilitate grounded and reliable research for mental\nhealthcare.",

To overcome this restriction, we introduce a\nfour-scalar field formulation that generalizes the two-scalar model and enables\nthe realization of arbitrary spherically symmetric spacetimes. We further\ndemonstrate that the model avoids ghost degrees of freedom by imposing\nappropriate constraints through Lagrange multipliers. As an application of the\nformalism, we examine a specific spherically symmetric metric and determine the\ncorresponding four scalar fields, analyzing their properties. In the presence\nof a quadratic extension of the action, ${\\cal T} + \\tfrac{\\alpha}{2}{\\cal\nT}^2$, our approach successfully reconstructs physically viable solutions free\nfrom ghost instabilities.

Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting\nstyle signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the\nmodel's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer\ncorrectness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.\nWe attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions\nin certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that\npreserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates\nthe style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation\nspace via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables\nindependent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing\ninterference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each\nsubspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to\nmaintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on\nmultiple styles and languages.

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the fetal brain has become a key tool for\nstudying brain development in vivo. Yet, its assessment remains challenging due\nto variability in brain maturation, imaging protocols, and uncertain estimates\nof Gestational Age (GA). To overcome these, brain atlases provide a\nstandardized reference framework that facilitates objective evaluation and\ncomparison across subjects by aligning the atlas and subjects in a common\ncoordinate system. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning framework\nfor generating continuous, age-specific fetal brain atlases for real-time fetal\nbrain tissue segmentation. The framework combines a direct registration model\nwith a conditional discriminator. Trained on a curated dataset of 219\nneurotypical fetal MRIs spanning from 21 to 37 weeks of gestation. The method\nachieves high registration accuracy, captures dynamic anatomical changes with\nsharp structural detail, and robust segmentation performance with an average\nDice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 86.3% across six brain tissues.\nFurthermore, volumetric analysis of the generated atlases reveals detailed\nneurotypical growth trajectories, providing valuable insights into the\nmaturation of the fetal brain. This approach enables individualized\ndevelopmental assessment with minimal pre-processing and real-time performance,\nsupporting both research and clinical applications.

    "abstract": "In recent years, traffic prediction has achieved remarkable success and has\nbecome an integral component of intelligent transportation systems. However,\ntraffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy\nconstraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for\ntraffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on\ndesigning communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information\nfrom other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such\napproaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting\ntransmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume\nof traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical,\nmaking the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for\nfederated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP).\nUnlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client\ncommunication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate\npredictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop\nFed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to\nprocess its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information\nloss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI\nsignificantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process,\nand achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy\nregulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and\nfederated settings. It achieves improvements of 8%, 14%, and 16% in RMSE, MAE,\nand MAPE, respectively, while also substantially reducing communication costs.",

    "abstract": "Current multi-view 3D reconstruction methods rely on accurate camera\ncalibration and pose estimation, requiring complex and time-intensive\npre-processing that hinders their practical deployment. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce Surf3R, an end-to-end feedforward approach that\nreconstructs 3D surfaces from sparse views without estimating camera poses and\ncompletes an entire scene in under 10 seconds. Our method employs a\nmulti-branch and multi-view decoding architecture in which multiple reference\nviews jointly guide the reconstruction process. Through the proposed\nbranch-wise processing, cross-view attention, and inter-branch fusion, the\nmodel effectively captures complementary geometric cues without requiring\ncamera calibration. Moreover, we introduce a D-Normal regularizer based on an\nexplicit 3D Gaussian representation for surface reconstruction. It couples\nsurface normals with other geometric parameters to jointly optimize the 3D\ngeometry, significantly improving 3D consistency and surface detail accuracy.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Surf3R achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on multiple surface reconstruction metrics on ScanNet++ and Replica\ndatasets, exhibiting excellent generalization and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Let $m$ and $r$ be integers with $m \\ge r \\ge 3$ and let $G$ be an\n$r$-regular graph of even order. Let $M$ be a matching in $G$ of size $m$ such\nthat each pair of edges in $M$ is at distance at least $3$. In 2023, Aldred et\nal. proved that if $G$ is cyclically $(mr-r+1)$-edge-connected and $G$ is\nbipartite, then there exists a perfect matching of $G$ containing $M$. In this\npaper, we present non-bipartite analogues of Aldred et al.'s theorem. An odd\near of $U \\subseteq V(G)$ is a path of odd length whose ends lie in $U$ but\nwhose internal vertices do not, or a cycle of odd length having exactly one\nvertex in $U$. Our first result shows that if $G$ is cyclically $(mr - m\n+1)$-edge-connected and there exist $mr - \\left\\lceil \\frac{r}{2} \\right\\rceil\n+ 1$ edge-disjoint odd ears of $V(M)$, then $M$ can be extended to a perfect\nmatching of $G$. We further show that if $G$ contains $mr-r+1$ edge-disjoint\nodd ears of $V(M)$ and no cyclic edge cut in $G$ of size less than\n$(2m-1)(r-1)$ separates an odd cycle from another cycle, then $M$ can still be\nextended to a perfect matching. The second result extends Aldred et al.'s\ntheorem to non-bipartite graphs in the case $r \\ge 4$, and in the case when $r\n= 3$ and each pair of edges in $M$ is at distance at least $5$. It is also\nshown that the above results hold when $m \\le r - 1$, without assuming the\ndistance condition on $M$.",

In the first part of the paper we report on a case study: a\nqualitative review on papers published in the ACL anthologies 2022 on\ndiscriminatory behavior of NLP systems. We find that the field (i) still has a\nstrong focus on a technological fix of algorithmic discrimination, and (ii) is\nstruggling with a firm grounding of their ethical or normative vocabulary.\nFurthermore, this vocabulary is very limited, focusing mostly on the terms\n\"harm\" and \"bias\". In the second part of the paper we argue that addressing the\nlatter problems might help with the former. The understanding of algorithmic\ndiscrimination as a technological problem is reflected in and reproduced by the\nvocabulary in use. The notions of \"harm\" and \"bias\" implicate a narrow framing\nof the issue of discrimination as one of the system-user interface. We argue\nthat instead of \"harm\" the debate should make \"injustice\" the key notion. This\nwould force us to understand the problem of algorithmic discrimination as a\nsystemic problem. Thereby, it would broaden our perspective on the complex\ninteractions that make NLP technology participate in discrimination.

Efficient detection of such a\nmultimode squeezed state is essential for unlocking its full potential.

While OPA has been used to characterize spatially multimode\nsqueezing, its application to spectrally multimode squeezing has not yet been\ndemonstrated. Here, we report on the first experimental demonstration of\nspectrally multimode squeezing detection using OPA. We achieve simultaneous\ndetection of squeezing across more than 60 spectral modes of a broadband\nsqueezed vacuum state. The observed squeezing is nearly uniform, ranging from\n-6.5 to -7 dB, which makes the source particularly suitable for constructing\ncontinuous-variable cluster states, and indicates the multimode capability of\nthe OPA.

To better\nunderstand why and how typically this correlation is high, we study reversible\nreaction kinetics on energy landscapes consisting of Gaussian wells and\nbarriers, respectively associated with the vertices and edges of regular\ngraphs. We find that for the correlation to be high it suffices for the heights\nof the barriers to vary significantly less than the depths of the wells,\nregardless of the degree of the underlying graph. As an application, we bound\nbelow the expected correlation exhibited by dynamics of the random energy\nmodel, known as the Bouchaud trap model.

Then we fine-tune\nseveral representation models on this dataset. We call these models\nConcept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE). By challenging our models and other models\non various lexical semantic tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed models\nprovide efficient multi-purpose representations of lexical meaning that reach\nbest performances in our experiments. We also show that CALE's fine-tuning\nbrings valuable changes to the spatial organization of embeddings.",

    "abstract": "Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest\nduring the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and\nrobustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the\nproperty that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the\nintervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state.\nWhile most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the\nvariables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on\nrepresentations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an\neffective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to\nfocus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically,\nwe propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding\nthat is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal\nvariables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is\ncapable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any\nadditional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate\nthat Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings,\nsignificantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world\nbenchmarks.",

    "abstract": "A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a\nsample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes\nlocalization of the object via a bounding box within the sample.\nClassification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by\ncounting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the\nground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as\nequivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy\nwith a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or\noperator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure\nexists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a\ngiven prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground\ntruth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions\ninstead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of\nmisclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in\ncomplexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class\nlabels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The\nscoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees\nthat represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors\ndiscouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer\ngranularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an\napproach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many\nerrors are made but by the kind or impact of errors.

However, their inherent dependence\non static parametric memory fundamentally limits their adaptability, factual\naccuracy, and interpretability in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Knowledge\ngraphs (KGs), as structured repositories of explicit relational knowledge,\noffer a promising approach for augmenting LLMs with external, interpretable\nmemory. Nevertheless, most existing methods that combine LLMs with KGs treat\nreasoning and knowledge updating as separate processes, resulting in suboptimal\nutilization of new information and hindering real-time updates. In this work,\nwe propose TRAIL: a novel, unified framework for Thinking, Reasoning, And\nIncremental Learning that couples joint inference and dynamic KG refinement\nwith large language models. TRAIL enables LLM agents to iteratively explore,\nupdate, and refine knowledge graphs during the reasoning process, employing a\nconfidence-driven mechanism for the generation, validation, and pruning of new\nfacts. This plug-and-play architecture facilitates seamless integration with\nvarious LLMs, supporting continual adaptation without the need for retraining.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms\nexisting KG-augmented and retrieval-augmented LLM baselines by 3% to 13%.

While it enables more efficient\nsimulations than the molecular dynamics (MD) methods, its accuracy in\nreproducing the flow properties of real fluids is limited by the underlying\nassumptions of the Vlasov forcing term. To address this limitation, this work\nproposes a molecular kinetic model specifically designed for real fluids, with\nthe Lennard-Jones fluids as an example. The model is first applied to evaluate\nthe equilibrium characteristics of a liquid-vapour system, including the\nliquid-vapour coexistence curve, vapour pressure, and surface tension\ncoefficient. The results show excellent agreement with the MD simulation and\nexperimental data. Furthermore, the model is used to investigate\nnon-equilibrium evaporation, with a particular focus on the velocity\ndistribution function adjacent to the liquid-vapour interface. The findings\nreveal significant deviations from the Maxwellian distribution in the vapour\nregion, suggesting that the classical Hertz-Knudsen relation becomes inaccurate\nwhen non-equilibrium effects are pronounced.

State-of-the-art methods formulate\nthis task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with\nsemantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update\nthe model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue\nthat existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in\nincomplete erasure due to \"non-zero alignment residual\", especially when text\nprompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality\ndegradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is\ndesigned for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall\ngenerative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict\nzero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect\nalignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete\nerasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that\ngradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from\nshallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes\ndiminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving\ngenerative quality.

    "abstract": "Lately, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a prevalent\nparadigm to deliver personalized models by collaboratively training while\nsimultaneously adapting to each client's local applications. Existing PFL\nmethods typically face a significant challenge due to the ubiquitous data\nheterogeneity (i.e., non-IID data) across clients, which severely hinders\nconvergence and degrades performance. We identify that the root issue lies in\nthe long-standing reliance on gradient-based updates, which are inherently\nsensitive to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue and bridge the\nresearch gap, in this paper, we propose a Heterogeneity-invariant Personalized\nFederated learning scheme, named FedHiP, through analytical (i.e., closed-form)\nsolutions to avoid gradient-based updates. Specifically, we exploit the trend\nof self-supervised pre-training, leveraging a foundation model as a frozen\nbackbone for gradient-free feature extraction. Following the feature extractor,\nwe further develop an analytic classifier for gradient-free training. To\nsupport both collective generalization and individual personalization, our\nFedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic\nglobal aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form\nsolutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity\ninvariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless\nof how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our FedHiP\nscheme, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines by at least 5.79%-20.97%\nin accuracy.",

Unlike previous multi-view video methods that\ndirectly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross\nview/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse\nmulti-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and\neffectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first\npredicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and\ntemporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware\nspatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse\nstructural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular\nvideo to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this,\nexplicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately,\nenabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D\nobject dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16\nvideos with 21 frames for each object.

The constrained size of the\ntransmitter imposes limitations on its storage capacity, constraining the\nnumber of available molecules for transmission, with a resulting effect on\ncommunication reliability. This paper primarily focuses on achieving an\nequilibrium between the number of transmitted molecules and the bit error rate\n(BER) performance. To this end, we first analyze the relationship between the\nnumber of transmitted molecules and the BER performance. Subsequently, a\nbalancing function that considers both the number of transmitted molecules and\nthe BER performance is introduced, taking into account the molecules'\nrespective weights. Given the difference in magnitude between the number of\ntransmitted molecules and the BER, these parameters are normalized to\nfacilitate analysis. Subsequently, a Gradient Descent Algorithm is employed to\ndetermine the optimal number of transmitted molecules, aiming to achieve the\noptimal equilibrium in the analyzed MC system.

However,\nexisting SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which\nforces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD,\nresulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the\ndraft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is\nrejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be\ndiscarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we\npropose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a\n'query-and-correct' paradigm.

This leads to\nexcessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical\ndeployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory\nmechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their\nreasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To\naddress this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),\nwhich explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and\ncontrol components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control\nstrategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction\nmechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and\ndelegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling\nthe construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a\nstructured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial\nmeta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment\nPolicy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control\nbehavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.\nExperiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained\nwith MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant\nadvancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in\ntasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences\nbetween images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in\npopular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception\nand reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a\nself-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task,\n\\underline{C}ausality-driven \\underline{V}isual object \\underline{C}ompletion\n(CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on\nits \\textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first\nobtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction\npipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or\nhuman assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error\nlearning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial\ngains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used\ncomprehensive benchmarks.

Remarkably, by\nallowing a staggered flux piercing through the plaquettes of the ladder, the\ngapless point bifurcates into two gapless critical lines, resulting in a\ntrivial gapped phase sandwiched between the two topological phases. This\nresults in a scenario where the system first undergoes a transition from one\ntopological phase to a trivial phase and then to the other topological phase as\na function of the quasiperiodic disorder strength.

    "abstract": "Modern software relies on a multitude of automated testing and quality\nassurance tools to prevent errors, bugs and potential vulnerabilities. This\nstudy sets out to provide a head-to-head, quantitative and qualitative\nevaluation of six automated approaches: three industry-standard rule-based\nstatic code-analysis tools (SonarQube, CodeQL and Snyk Code) and three\nstate-of-the-art large language models hosted on the GitHub Models platform\n(GPT-4.1, Mistral Large and DeepSeek V3). Using a curated suite of ten\nreal-world C# projects that embed 63 vulnerabilities across common categories\nsuch as SQL injection, hard-coded secrets and outdated dependencies, we measure\nclassical detection accuracy (precision, recall, F-score), analysis latency,\nand the developer effort required to vet true positives. The language-based\nscanners achieve higher mean F-1 scores,0.797, 0.753 and 0.750, than their\nstatic counterparts, which score 0.260, 0.386 and 0.546, respectively. LLMs'\nadvantage originates from superior recall, confirming an ability to reason\nacross broader code contexts. However, this benefit comes with substantial\ntrade-offs: DeepSeek V3 exhibits the highest false-positive ratio, all language\nmodels mislocate issues at line-or-column granularity due to tokenisation\nartefacts. Overall, language models successfully rival traditional static\nanalysers in finding real vulnerabilities. Still, their noisier output and\nimprecise localisation limit their standalone use in safety-critical audits. We\ntherefore recommend a hybrid pipeline: employ language models early in\ndevelopment for broad, context-aware triage, while reserving deterministic\nrule-based scanners for high-assurance verification.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold\npromise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical\ndeployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject\nclinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior\nknowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic\nprompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we\nrigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in\nsilico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference\nperformance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly\ntrained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot\nprompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or\nsuperior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,\nparticularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable\nlimitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including\narithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical\nlogic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,\nmeals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's\nlimitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through\ntextual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic\nintegration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of\ntargeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid\napproaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological\nmodelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements\ninto a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area,\nexisting methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities\nfor effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language\ndomain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem\nunderstanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot\nidentify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to\ninterpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions.\nTo address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training\npipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by\ndistilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and\nanother by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by\nexpert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to\nfurther fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models\nexhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal\nreasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5%\non FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior\ngeneral-purpose and specialized models.",

This paper proposes a hybrid trajectory\nplanning framework that integrates the adaptability of learning-based methods\nwith the formal safety guarantees of optimization-based approaches. The\nframework features a two-layer architecture: an upper layer employing a graph\nneural network (GNN) trained on real-world highway data to predict human-like\nlongitudinal velocity profiles, and a lower layer utilizing path optimization\nformulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. The primary\ncontribution is the lower-layer path optimization model, which introduces a\nlinear approximation of discretized vehicle geometry to substantially reduce\ncomputational complexity, while enforcing strict spatiotemporal non-overlapping\nconstraints to formally guarantee collision avoidance throughout the planning\nhorizon. Experimental results demonstrate that the planner generates highly\nsmooth, collision-free trajectories in complex real-world emergency scenarios,\nachieving success rates exceeding 97% with average planning times of 54 ms,\nthereby confirming real-time capability.",

In parallel, evidence accumulator models (EAMs) provide a\nmechanistic account of how effort arises from competition between the\nsubjective values of available options. Although EAMs have been combined with\nframeworks like Reinforcement Learning to bridge the gap between high-level\ntheories and process-level mechanisms, relatively less attention has been paid\nto their implications for a unified notion of cognitive effort. Here, we\ncombine Active Inference (AIF) with the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) to\ninvestigate whether the resulting AIF-DDM can simultaneously account for effort\narising from both habit violation and value discriminability. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first time AIF has been combined with an EAM. We tested the AIF-DDM\non a behavioral dataset from the two-step task and compared its predictions to\nan information-theoretic definition of cognitive effort based on AIF. The\nmodel's predictions successfully accounted for second-stage reaction times but\nfailed to capture the dynamics of the first stage. We argue the latter\ndiscrepancy likely stems from the experimental design rather than a fundamental\nflaw in the model's assumptions about cognitive effort.

These\nunusual low-symmetry electronic states give rise to novel nonreciprocal\ntransport and chiral quasiparticle-interference patterns. Especially, recent\nexperiments have discovered pronounced nematicity and chirality in the\nsuperconducting (SC) state. The observed SC state exhibits high sensitively to\nexternal magnetic fields, strongly suggesting the breaking of TRS. Furthermore,\na small amount of disorders leads to an isotropic s-wave state. In this study,\nwe propose the mechanism of nematic chiral d-wave superconductivity in the\npresence of loop-current order, emerging from the attractive charge-channel\npairing interaction that exists in real kagome metals. An chiral d-wave SC\nstate, which has a nontrivial topological properties, is driven by the TRS\nbreaking pair-hopping mechanism under a sole loop-current order. Notably,\nchiral SC state exhibits pronounced nematicity when the loop-current order and\nthe Star-of-David charge-density-wave coexist, in spite of the fact that the\nFermi surfaces possess almost perfect $C_6$ symmetry. The chiral\nsuperconducting state arising from this mechanism is easily switched to\nconventional s-wave SC by introducing a small amount of impurities.\nFurthermore, the present mechanism yields a prominent 2x2 pair-density-wave\ncomponent, consistent with experimental observations.

The technology employed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nsystems has evolved continuously, resulting in MRI scanners with stronger\nstatic magnetic fields (SMF) B0, faster and stronger gradient magnetic fields,\nand more powerful radiofrequency transmission coils. The most well-known hazard\nassociated with an MRI environment is the projectile effect due to Spatial\nField Gradient (SFG). Furthermore, movement through the SFG generates a\ntime-varying magnetic field, which in turn induces a voltage in body tissues.\nThis has the potential to result in a range of physiological symptoms,\nincluding headache, nausea, vertigo, phosphenes, numbness, tingling, loss of\nproprioception, and balance disturbances.\n  Approach. The methodology outlined in this study provides a comprehensive and\nreliable approach to creating a 3D map of the SMF (fringe field) around a\nclinical MRI facility. The methodology involves measuring the unperturbed B\nfield, including magnitude and axial components, in specific points and\nsubsequently performing a mathematical procedure involving fitting and\ninterpolation.\n  Main results.

Furthermore, since\nappropriate project management is subject to the innate uncertainties involved\nin most projects, they are required to be appraised respecting their profound\nimpact. In this paper, a new comprehensive multi-mode multi-objective linear\nprogramming model with two conflicting objectives, which are maximizing final\ncash flow for profit optimization and shortening the duration of project\nexecution, considering improving assumptions, that is, payments delays, project\nfinance constraints, initial capital, different types of interest rates, credit\nlimit to assuage financial distress, credit line usage, is presented in an\nuncertain environment. Since the model is considered as multi-objective with\nuncertain parameters, a new extended interval valued fuzzy - Torabi and Hassini\n(IVF-TH) approach is proposed to tackle the problem. The presented mixed\ninteger linear programming (MILP) model is solved applying CPLEX solver. In\naddition, a real construction project in oil and gas industry is presented as a\ncase study to illustrate the model applications.

We showed\nthat SIMBA can reproduce the observed $M_\\bullet-M_*$ relation well with little\ndifference between central and satellite galaxies. By using the median value to\ndetermine the residuals, we found that the residual is correlated with galaxy\ncold gas content, star formation rate, colour and black hole accretion\nproperties. Both torque and Bondi models implemented in SIMBA, contribute to\nthis residual, with torque accretion playing a major role at high redshift and\nlow-mass galaxies, while Bondi (also BH merge) takes over at low redshift and\nmassive galaxies. By dividing the sample into two populations: $\\Delta>0$ and\n$\\Delta <0$, we compared their evolution paths following the main progenitors.\nWith evolution tracking, we proposed a simple picture for the BH-galaxy\ncoevolution: Early-formed galaxies seeded black holes earlier, with stellar\nmass increasing rapidly to quickly reach the point of triggering `jet mode'\nfeedback. This process reduced the cold gas content and stopped the growth of\n$M_*$, effectively quenching galaxies. Meanwhile, during the initial phase of\ntorque accretion growth, the BH mass is comparable between galaxies formed\nearly and those formed later. However, those galaxies that formed earlier\nappear to attain a marginally greater BH mass when shifting to Bondi accretion,\naligning with the galaxy transition time. As the early-formed galaxies reach\nthis point earlier -- leaving a longer time for them to have Bondi accretion as\nwell as merging, their residuals become positive, i.e., having more massive BHs\nat $z=0$ compared to these late-formed galaxies at the same $M_*$. This picture\nis further supported by the strong positive correlation between the residuals\nand the galaxy age, which we are proposing as a verification with observation\ndata on this story suggested by SIMBA.",

We calculate the $D_B$ of 197\ngrand-designs and 322 flocculents from SDSS DR18, using the samples of\n\\citet{Buta..2015} and \\citet{Sarkar..2023}. Our calculated median values of\n$D_B$ are $1.29^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$ and $1.38^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$ for the\ngrand-designs and flocculents, respectively. In addition, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n(K-S) test rejects null hypothesis that these distributions are drawn from the\nsame population. Finally, using a Random Forest (RF) model, we compare the\neffectiveness of $D_B$ in classifying spiral arm morphology, as compared to\nfive other parameters viz. total atomic hydrogen HI mass $M_{HI}$, ratio of\natomic hydrogen mass-to-blue luminosity $M_{HI} /L_B$, concentration index\n$C_i$, clumpiness $S$ and arm-contrast $C$. Our results indicate that $D_B$ has\nthe highest feature index (30.8\\%), followed by $C_i$ (26.0\\%) and $M_{HI}$\n(21.0\\%). In fact, C, the metric routinely used to distinguish between the\nspiral morphologies has a feature importance of 8.3\\%. Further, $D_B$ for\ngrand-designs is found to anti-correlate with the central velocity dispersion\nwith a correlation coefficient of -0.3 and $p \\ll 0.05$. A high value of\ncentral velocity dispersion indicates a central Q-barrier, which favors the\nformation of grand designs according to the density wave theory.

Our analysis is based on a\nsample of galaxies that is stellar mass complete down to $\\log\n\\left(M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot}\\right) \\approx 8.1$. The redshift evolution of the\nSFMS at an averaging timescale of 10 Myr follows a relation, quantified by the\nspecific star-formation rates (sSFR$_{10}$), of\n$\\mathrm{sSFR}\\propto(1+z)^{\\mu}$ with $\\mu = 2.30^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$, in good\nagreement with theoretical predictions and the specific mass accretion rate of\ndark matter halos. We find that the SFMS normalisation varies in a complex way\nwith the SFR averaging timescale, reflecting the combined effects of bursty\nstar formation and rising star formation histories (SFHs). We quantify the\nscatter of the SFMS, revealing that it decreases with longer SFR averaging\ntimescales, from $\\sigma_{\\rm{int}} \\approx 0.4-0.5~\\mathrm{dex}$ at 10 Myr to\n$\\sigma_{\\rm{int}} \\approx 0.2~\\mathrm{dex}$ at 100 Myr, indicating that\nshorter-term fluctuations dominate the scatter, although long-term variations\nin star formation activity are also present. Our findings suggest that bursty\nSFHs are more pronounced at lower stellar masses. Furthermore, we explore the\nimplications of our results for the observed over-abundance of UV-bright\ngalaxies at $z > 10$, concluding that additional mechanisms, such as top-heavy\ninitial mass functions, increased star-formation efficiencies, or increased\nburstiness in star formation are needed to explain these observations. Finally,\nwe emphasize the importance of accurate stellar mass completeness limits when\nfitting the SFMS, especially for galaxies with bursty SFHs.",

Dense radio antenna arrays such as the LOw\nFrequency ARray (LOFAR) telescope as well as the upcoming Square Kilometre\nArray Observatory (SKAO) are ideal instruments to explore the potential of air\nshower profile reconstruction, as their high antenna density allows cosmic ray\nobservations with unprecedented accuracy. However, current analysis approaches\ncan only recover $X_\\mathrm{max}$, the atmospheric depth at shower maximum, and\nheavily rely on computationally expensive simulations. As such, it is ever more\ncrucial to develop new analysis approaches that can perform a full air shower\nprofile reconstruction efficiently.\n  In this work, we develop a novel framework to reconstruct the longitudinal\nprofile of air showers using measurements from radio detectors with Information\nField Theory (IFT), a state-of-the-art reconstruction framework based on\nBayesian inference. Through IFT, we are able to exploit all available\ninformation in the signal (amplitude, phase, and pulse shape) at each antenna\nposition simultaneously and explicitly utilise models that are motivated\nthrough our current understanding of air shower physics. We verify our\nframework on simulated datasets prepared for LOFAR, showcasing that we can not\nonly reconstruct the air shower profile with uncertainties in each atmospheric\ndepth bin but also recover the reconstructed trace at each antenna position.\nOur framework demonstrates that radio measurements with dense antenna layouts\nsuch as LOFAR and SKAO have the capability to go beyond reconstruction of\n$X_\\mathrm{max}$ and will thus aid in our understanding of the mass composition\nof cosmic rays.",

This study explores the potential of\nmagnetic resonance perfusion (MRP) imaging as a tool for differentiating distal\nAIS from epileptic seizures, a prevalent SM. Using a retrospective dataset of\n162 patients (129 AIS, 33 seizures), we extracted region-wise perfusion map\ndescriptors (PMDs) from dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) images.\nStatistical analyses identified several brain regions, located mainly in the\ntemporal and occipital lobe, exhibiting significant group differences in\ncertain PMDs. Hemispheric asymmetry analyses further highlighted these regions\nas discriminative. A logistic regression model trained on PMDs achieved an area\nunder the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.90, and an area\nunder the precision recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.74, with a specificity of 92% and\na sensitivity of 73%, suggesting strong performance in distinguishing distal\nAIS from seizures. These findings support further exploration of MRP-based PMDs\nas interpretable features for distinguishing true strokes from various mimics.\nThe code is openly available at our GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Marijn311/PMD_extraction_and_analysis{github.com/Marijn311/PMD\\_extraction\\_and\\_analysis",

We study the\ncommunication-learning co-design problem in differentially private over-the-air\nFD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting the transmit\npower and DP requirements of WDs. The main challenge is rooted in the\nintractable learning and privacy analysis in over-the-air FD, together with the\nstrong coupling among the decision variables spanning two timescales. To tackle\nthis problem, we first derive the analytical learning convergence rate and\nprivacy losses of WDs, based on which the optimal transceiver design per FD\nround and long-term training rounds decision are obtained in the closed forms.\nNumerical results demonstrate that the proposed differentially private\nover-the-air FD approach achieves a better learning-privacy trade-off with\nlargely-reduced communication overhead than the conventional FL benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks\nhas raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired\ncapabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit\ntraining. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing\nthe epistemological challenge of \"creation without understanding\" that\ncharacterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's\nreliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic\ncomputational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot\nbe analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of\nscaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,\nI demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly\nsensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My\ninvestigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss\nthresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of\nemergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent\nproperties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where\nsystemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple\ncomponents without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper\nconcludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a\nnew domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of\nemergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This\nperspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of\nemergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable\nthese systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual\ncomponents.",

We find that naive application of\nRFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we\ndecompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of\neach. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically\nstabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further\nexplore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive\nexperiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT\nmethods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on\nScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on\nScreenSpotV2.",

We detect numerous\nsmall-scale structures rooted at the network patches, similar to observations\nin H$\\alpha$. The dynamics of an example feature (RBE) at a Doppler shift of 37\nkm/s show that flux emergence and consequent reconnection drive the formation\nof this feature.

To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework,\nProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity\nusing a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a\nclass-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes\nidentity-level information.

    "abstract": "Designing Knowledge Management Systems (KMSs) for higher education requires\naddressing complex human-technology interactions, especially where staff\nturnover and changing roles create ongoing challenges for reusing knowledge.\nWhile advances in process mining and Generative AI enable new ways of designing\nfeatures to support knowledge management, existing KMSs often overlook the\nrealities of educators' workflows, leading to low adoption and limited impact.\nThis paper presents findings from a two-year human-centred design study with\n108 higher education teachers, focused on the iterative co-design and\nevaluation of GoldMind, a KMS supporting in-the-flow knowledge management\nduring digital teaching tasks. Through three design-evaluation cycles, we\nexamined how teachers interacted with the system and how their feedback\ninformed successive refinements. Insights are synthesised across three themes:\n(1) Technology Lessons from user interaction data, (2) Design Considerations\nshaped by co-design and usability testing, and (3) Human Factors, including\ncognitive load and knowledge behaviours, analysed using Epistemic Network\nAnalysis.",

Their low-frequency millimeter and radio\nproperties, on the other hand, remain poorly understood. We present\nobservations of the millimeter and radio emission of binaries where a neutron\nstar accretes from an OB supergiant. We report ALMA and NOEMA millimeter\nobservations of twelve systems, supplemented by VLA radio observations of six\nof those targets. Our targets include six Supergiant X-ray Binaries (SgXBs),\nfour Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs), and two intermediate systems.\nNine out of twelve targets, including all SFXTs, are detected in at least one\nmillimeter band, while in the radio, only two targets are detected. All\ndetected targets display inverted radio/millimeter spectra, with spectral\nindices in the range $\\alpha =0.6-0.8$ for those systems where accurate SED\nfits could be performed. We conclude, firstly, that the low-frequency SEDs of\nneutron star SFXTs and SgXBs are dominated by free-free emission from the OB\nsupergiant's stellar wind, and that jet emission is unlikely to be observed\nunless the systems can be detected at sub-GHz frequencies. Secondly, we find\nthat SFXTs are fainter at 100 GHz than prototypical SgXBs, probably due to\nsystematically less dense winds in the former, as supported further by the\ndifferences in their fluorescence Fe K$\\alpha$ lines. We furthermore compare\nthe stellar wind constraints obtained from our millimeter observations with\nthose from IR/optical/UV studies and bow shock detections, and present evidence\nfor long-term stellar wind variability visible in the thermal emission.",

This paper\ninvestigates a pocket-sized companion robot designed to offer a relaxation\ntechnique requiring no prior training, with a focus on immediate impact on the\nuser's heart rate. The robot utilizes a tactile game to divert the user's\nattention, thereby promoting relaxation.

The limitation arises from MLLMs'\ncontext limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before\nfeeding videos into MLLMs. However, building a trainable sampling method\nremains challenging due to the unsupervised and non-differentiable nature of\nsparse frame sampling in Video-MLLMs. To address these problems, we propose\nTemporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing MLLMs' long-form\nvideo-language understanding via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first\npropose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which captures event-query\ncorrelation for performing probabilistic keyframe selection. Then, we propose\nthe TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which models keyframe selection and\nlanguage generation as a joint decision-making process, enabling end-to-end\ngroup relative optimization for the temporal sampling policy. Furthermore, we\npropose a dual-style long video training data construction pipeline, balancing\ncomprehensive temporal understanding and key segment localization. Finally, we\nincorporate rule-based answering accuracy and temporal locating reward\nmechanisms to optimize the temporal sampling policy.

    "abstract": "While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate\nimpressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their\nintelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency,\nwhile interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically\nignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm,\nwe introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,\nbut to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the\nfull sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence,\nOmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create\nscenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine\ncross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal\nmodels reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on\nhigh-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges\nrequiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this\nfragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic\nperformance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive\n\"less is more\" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically\nimprove performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI\nrequires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic\nfusion.

To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions:\nPrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy\nattacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD,\nwhich leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and\nprevent query-based inversion generalization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and\nCelebA demonstrate that PrivDFS achieves privacy comparable to deep split\ninference while cutting client computation by up to 100 times with no accuracy\nloss, and that the extensions remain robust against both diffusion-based\nin-distribution and adaptive attacks.",

    "abstract": "This work studies the effect of the heterogeneity of a porous medium on\nconvective mixing. We consider a system where a Rayleigh-B\\'enard instability\nis triggered by a temperature difference between the top and bottom boundaries.\nHeterogeneity is represented by multi-Gaussian log-normally distributed\npermeability fields. We explore the effect of the Rayleigh number, the variance\nand correlation length of the log-permeability field on the fingering patterns,\nheat flux, mixing state and flow structure. Heat flux increases for all\nheterogeneous cases compared to the homogeneous ones. When heterogeneity is\nweak and the horizontal correlation length small, flux exhibits minimal\nsensitivity to the variance of the log-permeability. When the correlation\nlength increases, flux increases proportionally to the log-permeability\nvariance. The mixing state is evaluated through the temperature variance and\nthe intensity of segregation. Both take higher values, compared to their\nhomogeneous analogues, when the correlation length and the variance of the\npermeability are increased. This indicates that even if heat flux increases,\nthe system is less well mixed. The flow structure shows that in homogeneous and\nweakly heterogeneous cases there is a relation between the location of high\nstrain rate and stagnation point, while for strongly heterogeneous cases, high\nstrain rate zones are linked to high permeability areas near the boundaries,\nwhere temperature plume originate. The interface width tends to decrease as the\nvariance and the correlation length of the permeability field are augmented,\nsuggesting that the interface undergoes a higher stretching in heterogeneous\nporous media.",

To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative\nReasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from\nprobability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking \"Which\nanswer is most likely?\", DRN asks \"Which hypothesis has the most internally\nconsistent evidence?\". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly\ntracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing\nhypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our\napproach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative\nmodel that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a\nlightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs.\nEvaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to\nexpose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over\nstandard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with\nMistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most\nchallenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot\ngeneralization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional\ntraining, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable\nreasoning principles.

The experiments yield several novel\ninsights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain.

All the S-,\nU- and C-type particles are spherical in shape, with distinct interaction\nstrengths. The phase behavior of the system is studied for various compositions\n($x$) of the C-type particles, ranging from $x = 0.1$ to $0.9$. The results\nshow that a structurally ordered complex is formed with the S- and C-types in\nthe fluid-like environment of U-type particles, for $x \\in \\lbrace 0.5 -\n0.6\\rbrace$. The time-averaged hexatic order parameter $\\left\\langle \\Psi_{6}\n\\right\\rangle$ indicates that the dynamical segregation of S- and C-types\nexhibits a positional order, that is found to be maximum for $x$ in the range\nof 0.5 - 0.6. The mean change in the free energy ($\\Delta G(x)$) obtained from\nthe mean change in enthalpy ($\\Delta H$) and entropy ($\\Delta S$) calculations\nsuggests that $\\Delta G$ is minimum for $x \\sim 0.6$. A phenomenological\nexpression for the Gibbs free energy is formulated by explicitly accounting for\nthe individual free energies of S-,U- and C-type particles and the mutual\ninteractions between them.

    "abstract": "Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural\nnetworks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for\neach layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current\nstate-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or\nlocal sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the\ncascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the\nquantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local\nproperties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire\nnetwork. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in\nthe bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each\nlayer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the\nresulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This\nquantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information\nflow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an\ninteger linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize\ntotal sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our\nretraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off\n(using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods\nsuch as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2\nand ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).",

Existing research on FAS primarily\nfocuses on line-of-sight (LoS) communication scenarios, and neglects the\nsituations where only NLoS links exist. To address the issues posted by NLoS\ncommunication, we design an FAR-assisted communication system combined with\namplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. In order to alleviate the high energy\nconsumption introduced by AF protocol while ensuring communication quality, we\nformulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem. By optimizing the\npositions of the fluid antennas (FAs) on both sides of the FAR, we achieve\ncontrollable phase shifts of the signals transmitting through the blockage\nwhich causes the NLoS link. Besides, we establish a channel model that jointly\nconsiders the blockage-through matrix, large-scale fading, and small-scale\nfading. To maximize the EE of the system, we jointly optimize the FAR position,\nFA positions, power control, and beamforming design under given constraints,\nand propose an iterative algorithm to solve this formulated optimization\nproblem.

A shear flow is present in the direction of the\nmagnetic field with a velocity that varies linearly across the magnetic field.\nThe linearized MHD equations in the single-fluid approximation are used, which\ninclude the ambipolar diffusion term due to ion-neutral collisions. A nonmodal\napproach is adopted, in order to convert the flow spatial inhomogeneity into a\ntemporal one, adding a temporal dependence into the component of the wavevector\nin the direction of the flow inhomogeneity. A system of three ordinary\ndifferential equations is derived, which generally governs the temporal\nevolution of the coupled MHD waves, their interaction with the shear flow, and\ntheir ambipolar damping. Numerical solutions are computed to study the coupling\nand mutual transformation between the fast magnetosonic wave and the Alfv\\'en\nwave.

    "abstract": "Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications\nacross various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to\nheterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial\nintelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a\nshortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes\na foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,\nnamed MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,\nencompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter\nsecurity, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset\nsignals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a\nself-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of\nDAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition\ntasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes\nonly a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the\nTransformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super\nplatform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The\nVPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%\nof parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)\nmethod by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits\nrobust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality,\nefficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach\noffers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal\nrecognition models in the DAS domain.",

    "abstract": "Supersymmetry algebras can be used to obtain algebraic expressions for\nconstant Yang-Baxter solutions, also known as braid group generators. This was\ndone for non-invertible braid operators in \\cite{maity2025non}. In this work we\nextend this construction for the invertible ones. The resulting expressions are\nthen shown to obey relations analogous to those satisfied by quotients of braid\ngroups. Examples of the latter include the Iwahori-Hecke algebra and the\nBirman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) algebra. As a result, we can Baxterize the constant\nYang-Baxter solutions to yield spectral parameter dependent $R$-matrices. The\nregularity of these $R$-matrices depend on the representation of SUSY\ngenerators. In some cases they are regular in the usual sense and in the\nremaining they are `almost' regular. In the latter case they are also\nnon-invertible. Nevertheless we show that they can still help us construct\nintegrable models in all dimensions of the local Hilbert space. These models\ncan be described by Hamiltonian densities that are either local or non-local,\ndepending on the representation chosen for the SUSY generators. We demonstrate\nthis for all constant $4\\times 4$ invertible Yang-Baxter solutions.

In this work, we\nintroduce a new two-phase efficient machine unlearning method for image\nclassification, in terms of weight saliency, leveraging weight saliency to\nfocus the unlearning process on critical model parameters. Our method is called\nweight saliency soft-guided contrastive learning for efficient machine\nunlearning image classification (WSS-CL), which significantly narrows the\nperformance gap with \"exact\" unlearning. First, the forgetting stage maximizes\nkullback-leibler divergence between output logits and aggregated pseudo-labels\nfor efficient forgetting in logit space. Next, the adversarial fine-tuning\nstage introduces contrastive learning in a self-supervised manner. By using\nscaled feature representations, it maximizes the distance between the forgotten\nand retained data samples in the feature space, with the forgotten and the\npaired augmented samples acting as positive pairs, while the retained samples\nact as negative pairs in the contrastive loss computation.

    "abstract": "Rust's compile-time safety guarantees make it ideal for safety-critical\nsystems, creating demand for translating legacy C codebases to Rust. While\nvarious approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs:\nrule-based solutions face challenges in meeting code safety and idiomaticity\nrequirements, while LLM-based solutions often fail to generate semantically\nequivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the\nentire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited\nto small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated\nframework for converting entire C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust\nemploys a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation.\nThe pipeline consists of three evolutionary stages: 1) it first decomposes the\nC project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to\ntransform definitions and macros and generates type-checked function stubs,\nwhich form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates the\nfunction, replacing the corresponding stub placeholder; 3) finally, it repairs\ncompilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary\naugmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and\nLLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six\nindustrial projects demonstrates EvoC2Rust's superior performance in\nproject-level C-to-Rust translation. On average, it achieves 17.24% and 14.32%\nimprovements in syntax and semantic accuracy over the LLM-based approaches,\nalong with a 96.79% higher code safety rate than the rule-based tools.

Our approach\npermits carrying out statistical inference for a wide class of hypoelliptic\nIPSs that are not covered by recent works as the latter rely on the\nEuler-Maruyama scheme.

In practical situations where only partial\nobservations (e.g. particle positions but not velocities) are available, the\nproposed locally Gaussian approximation offers greater flexibility for\ninference, when combined with established Bayesian techniques. In particular,\nunlike the Euler-Maruyama-based approaches, we do not have to impose\nrestrictive structures on the hypoelliptic IPSs.

    "abstract": "Point cloud registration is a classical topic in the field of 3D Vision and\nComputer Graphics. Generally, the implementation of registration is typically\nsensitive to similarity transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation),\nnoisy points, and incomplete geometric structures. Especially, the non-uniform\nscales and defective parts of point clouds increase probability of struck local\noptima in registration task. In this paper, we propose a robust point cloud\nregistration PKSS-Align that can handle various influences, including\nsimilarity transformations, non-uniform densities, random noisy points, and\ndefective parts. The proposed method measures shape feature-based similarity\nbetween point clouds on the Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS),\n\\textcolor{black}{which is a shape measurement-based scheme and doesn't require\npoint-to-point or point-to-plane metric.} The employed measurement can be\nregarded as the manifold metric that is robust to various representations in\nthe Euclidean coordinate system. Benefited from the measurement, the\ntransformation matrix can be directly generated for point clouds with mentioned\ninfluences at the same time. The proposed method does not require data training\nand complex feature encoding.

However, label errors, defined as missing labels,\nincorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the\nquality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes\nof training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for\ndetecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically\nvalidated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to\ncorrect such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open\nproblem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction\ncalled REC$\\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the\nframework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced\nmicrotasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each\ncandidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate\nambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nREC$\\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our\ncrowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a\nrate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original\nannotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark\nfor label error detection and correction. We show that current label error\ndetection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover\nhundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes\nfrom scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true\nerrors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find.

To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods\nsolely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the\ncomplementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to\ntackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally\nand simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval.\nThese designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video\nmoment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or\nbackground sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end,\nwe propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which\nlearns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts\nfor VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and\naudio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance\npredictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly\nassigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we\ndesign a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and\nvisual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their\ncomplementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation\nstrategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference.\nTo evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e.,\nCharades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and\nre-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability\nin utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness\nof our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR\nmethods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/IMG.",

While on-device AI becomes popular, supporting\nmultiple tasks on edge devices imposes significant resource challenges. To\naddress this, we introduce S2M3, a split-and-share multi-modal architecture for\nmulti-task inference on edge devices. Inspired by the general-purpose nature of\nmulti-modal models, which are composed of multiple modules (encoder, decoder,\nclassifier, etc.), we propose to split multi-modal models at functional-level\nmodules; and then share common modules to reuse them across tasks, thereby\nreducing resource usage. To address cross-model dependency arising from module\nsharing, we propose a greedy module-level placement with per-request parallel\nrouting by prioritizing compute-intensive modules. Through experiments on a\ntestbed consisting of 14 multi-modal models across 5 tasks and 10 benchmarks,\nwe demonstrate that S2M3 can reduce memory usage by up to 50% and 62% in\nsingle-task and multi-task settings, respectively, without sacrificing\naccuracy.

While prior works have\ndemonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic\nrepresentations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics. This\noversight often leads to significant performance degradation in tasks like\nobject recognition and compromises their biological fidelity. To address this,\nwe leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture\nspike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We\npropose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic\ndeep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the\nhierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual\ncortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our\nresults show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features\nacross simulated visual cortical areas. While introducing topography typically\nleads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture\nexhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1\naccuracy, compared to a 3\\% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the\nbest-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in\nbrain-likeness. We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates\nefficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in\nTDSNNs, contributing to model robustness.

However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as\ndatabase intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise.\nInternal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it\neasier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external\nmasqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the\norganization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect\nanomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences\nof operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent\nnormal behavior. On the other hand, some anomalous behaviors often resemble\nnormal activities, making them difficult for existing detection methods to\nidentify.

Our method combines both unsupervised and supervised\nmachine learning techniques to accurately identify anomalous activities while\nminimizing the need for data labeling. First, the unsupervised method uses\nensemble anomaly detectors that flag embedding vectors distant from learned\nnormal patterns of typical user behavior across the database (out-of-scope\nqueries). Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based\nmodels to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using\nrole-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data.

    "abstract": "Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment\nnovel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent\nadvancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained\nVision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct\nFine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,\nremains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a\nperformance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe\ncatastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex\nmitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is\nflawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two\nstandard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using\ntwo representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed\nprobing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly\nunderestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under\nDFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further\ninvestigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting\nprimarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than\nfrom degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we\npropose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates\nstrategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned\nclassifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive\nexperiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior\nperformance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring\nsubstantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.",

Exogenous information is modelled via\nfiltration-like objects providing dynamic updates on the \"realised tree\", and\nan abstract decision-theoretic model of adapted choice is formulated.\n  Based on this, a consistent model of \"rules\" is introduced, leading to the\nnotion of stochastic extensive forms, generalising the works of\nAl\\'os-Ferrer--Ritzberger (2008, 2011). Well-posedness is completely\ncharacterised in terms of order-theoretic properties of the underlying forest.\nMoreover, the language of stochastic extensive forms addresses a vast class of\ndynamic decision problems formulated in terms of time-indexed paths of action\n-- a first step towards an approximation theory of continuous-time games based\non stochastic processes. In this formulation, a well-posed theory obtains if\nand only if the time half-axis is essentially well-ordered.\n  Therefore, a relaxed game-theoretic model of \"extensive form characteristics\"\nis introduced: the stochastic process form.

    "abstract": "One-weight codes, in which all nonzero codewords share the same weight, form\na highly structured class of linear codes with deep connections to finite\ngeometry. While their classification is well understood in the Hamming and rank\nmetrics - being equivalent to (direct sums of) simplex codes - the sum-rank\nmetric presents a far more intricate landscape. In this work, we explore the\ngeometry of one-weight sum-rank metric codes, focusing on three distinct\nclasses. First, we introduce and classify \\emph{constant rank-list} sum-rank\ncodes, where each nonzero codeword has the same tuple of ranks, extending\nresults from the rank-metric setting. Next, we investigate the more general\n\\emph{constant rank-profile} codes, where, up to reordering, each nonzero\ncodeword has the same tuple of ranks. Although a complete classification\nremains elusive, we present the first examples and partial structural results\nfor this class. Finally, we consider one-weight codes that are also MSRD\n(Maximum Sum-Rank Distance) codes. For dimension two, constructions arise from\npartitions of scattered linear sets on projective lines. For dimension three,\nwe connect their existence to that of special $2$-fold blocking sets in the\nprojective plane, leading to new bounds and nonexistence results over certain\nfields.",

Building on the classical Borrvall--Petersson\nformulation for Stokes flow, we develop a narrow-band optimization algorithm\nthat concentrates computational effort on the fluid--solid interface, where it\nis most needed. To address the high cost of repeated forward and adjoint\nanalyses, we utilize a flow solver specifically optimized for high-resolution\nvoxel grids. The solver reduces memory usage and computational time by removing\nsolid voxels from the analyses and directly imposing the no-slip boundary\ncondition at the fluid--solid interface. It also employs an efficient\npreconditioner built on the Algebraic Multigrid method that ensures fast and\nreliable convergence for intricate flow configurations. The discretization uses\na staggered-grid finite-difference scheme (marker-and-cell) for the\nStokes--Brinkman model and an upwind finite-difference scheme for the heat\nconvection--diffusion equation, ensuring stability at high Peclet numbers. We\ndemonstrate the method on several examples, including the optimization of a\ntwo-fluid heat exchanger at $Pe = 10^{4}$ on a $370^{3}$ grid comprising $5\n\\times 10^{7}$ design variables using only a single desktop workstation.

The knowledge graph explicitly models\nthe spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a\nstructured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.\nMeanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying\nand leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing\nrich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a\nnew large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named\nVehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations\nacross diverse scenes and viewpoints.

Our goal is twofold: to study the influence\nof highly refractory dust species on the inner rim shape and to determine how\nthe magnetic field affects the inner disk structure. The resulting temperature\nand density structures are analyzed and compared to observations. The\ncomparison focuses on a median SED of Herbig stars and interferometric\nconstraints from the H, K, and N-band of three Herbig-type star-disk systems:\nHD 100546, HD 163296, and HD 169142. We investigate 1) the influence of a\nlarge-scale magnetic field on the inner disk structure and 2) the effect of\nhaving the four most important dust species (corundum, iron, forsterite, and\nenstatite) shaping the rim. We use frequency-dependent irradiation and the\neffect of accretion heating. With the Optool package, we obtain\nfrequency-dependent opacities for each dust grain family and calculate the\ncorresponding temperature-dependent Planck and Rosseland opacities. Our models\nwith multiple dust species show a smoother and radially more extended inner\nrim. Strongly magnetized disks show a substantial increase in the emission flux\nbetween the L and N-bands. Weakly magnetized disk models with large-scale\nvertical magnetic fields < 0.3 Gauss at 1 au best fit with NIR interferometric\nobservations. Our model comparison supports the existence of moderate magnetic\nfields ($\\beta$ > $10^4$), which could still drive a magnetic wind in the inner\ndisk. Our results show that multi-dust models, including magnetic fields, still\nlack NIR emission, especially in the H-band.

First, we design a\nDD-a-OFDM system structure, retaining the classical OFDM transceiver while\nincorporating DD domain channel estimation and TF domain equalization.

Buffet cells\nare cellular patterns with spanwise periodicity that propagate toward the wing\ntip, with nondimensional frequencies (Strouhal numbers) of 0.2--0.6, higher\nthan those of shock oscillations associated with transonic buffet. However, the\nphysical mechanisms driving buffet cells and their interaction with\nlow-frequency shock motion are not fully understood. This study employs\nvariational mode decomposition-based nonstationary coherent structure (VMD-NCS)\nanalysis applied to unsteady pressure-sensitive paint measurement data. The\nresults reveal that the amplitude of buffet cells is not directly coupled to\nthe low-frequency shock-wave oscillations but instead shows correlation with\nthe boundary layer separation state. Strong buffet cell fluctuations persist in\nregions of sustained separation (midspan), while their amplitude varies with\nlocal separation/reattachment dynamics in regions of intermittent separation\n(outboard). These observations suggest that shock-waves are important to\ngenerate the adverse pressure gradient necessary for boundary layer separation,\nbut their influence on buffet cells depends on the resulting separation\nbehavior. This insight from experimental observations in this study is\nconsistent with previous computational studies suggesting that buffet cell\nbehavior depends on boundary layer separation characteristics.

This shortage has motivated\nthe development of simulated or virtual patients to assist in training and\nevaluation, but existing approaches often fail to generate clinically valid,\nnatural, and diverse symptom presentations. In this work, we embrace the recent\nadvanced language models as the backbone and propose a novel\nclinician-in-the-loop patient simulation pipeline, TalkDep, with access to\ndiversified patient profiles to develop simulated patients. By conditioning the\nmodel on psychiatric diagnostic criteria, symptom severity scales, and\ncontextual factors, our goal is to create authentic patient responses that can\nbetter support diagnostic model training and evaluation. We verify the\nreliability of these simulated patients with thorough assessments conducted by\nclinical professionals.

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method called\n\\textbf{I$^3$-MRec}, which uses \\textbf{I}nvairant learning with\n\\textbf{I}nformation bottleneck principle for \\textbf{I}ncomplete\n\\textbf{M}odality \\textbf{Rec}ommendation. To achieve robust performance in\nmissing modality scenarios, I$^3$-MRec enforces two pivotal properties: (i)\ncross-modal preference invariance, ensuring consistent user preference modeling\nacross varying modality environments, and (ii) compact yet effective multimodal\nrepresentation, as modality information becomes unreliable in such scenarios,\nreducing the dependence on modality-specific information is particularly\nimportant. By treating each modality as a distinct semantic environment,\nI$^3$-MRec employs invariant risk minimization (IRM) to learn\npreference-oriented representations. In parallel, a missing-aware fusion module\nis developed to explicitly simulate modality-missing scenarios. Built upon the\nInformation Bottleneck (IB) principle, the module aims to preserve essential\nuser preference signals across these scenarios while effectively compressing\nmodality-specific information. Extensive experiments conducted on three\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that I$^3$-MRec consistently outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art MRS methods across various modality-missing\nscenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in practical\napplications.",

For thermoresponsive microgels, i.e.\ncolloidal particles comprising a crosslinked polymer network that undergo a\nvolume transition upon temperature changes, structural control is key to tailor\nthe material responsivity and broaden the range of applications. In this work,\nwe present a comprehensive investigation of the internal structure of\npoly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-N-isopropylmethacrylamide), P(NIPAM-co-NIPMAM),\ncopolymer microgels, combining small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), dynamic\nlight scattering (DLS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements with\nmulti-scale simulations. By synthesizing different samples, we probe the\nmicrogels swelling behavior, revealing distinct signatures of the individual\npolymers. To elucidate their internal distribution, we perform monomer-resolved\nmicrogel simulations across different copolymer models. A direct comparison\nbetween experimental and numerical form factors under different,\nneutron-selective conditions provides evidence of a preferential organization\ninto block structures rather than a random arrangement. These results are\nconfirmed by 13C-NMR which reveals the clear presence of NIPAM blocks within a\nmore random arrangement of the remaining monomers and by atomistic molecular\ndynamics simulations on copolymer chains, which also shed light on a possible\norigin in the dependence of the hydrogen bonding capability on the local\nenvironment. These findings provide a detailed microscopic picture of the inner\narchitecture of P(NIPAM-co-NIPMAM) microgels, revealing an unexpected\nstructural organization that may be generalized to other copolymer systems and\ncould be promising to tailor microgel design and enhance control of material\nresponsivity.",

Five pre-trained models\nwere used to extract images features, and these features were passed to a\ncustom shallow network for Doppler angle estimation.

The mean absolute error (MAE) between the automated and manual\nangle estimates ranged from 3.9{\\deg} to 9.4{\\deg} for the models evaluated.\nFurthermore, the MAE for the best performing model was less than the acceptable\nclinical Doppler angle error threshold thus avoiding misclassification of\nnormal velocity values as a stenosis.

We evaluate the fluctuation\nmoments for the number of particles and the correlated fluctuations for number\nand energy of particles, clustering under their mutual gravitation. The\ncorrelated fluctuations $<\\Delta N\\Delta U>$ show that the value of $<\\Delta\nN>$ can be both positive as well as negative, because it is the difference\nbetween $N$ and the mean value of $N$. A negative $<\\Delta N>$ corresponds to\nregions of under density and positive $<\\Delta N>$ corresponds to regions of\nover density, as described by the clustering parameter $b$. The present work is\nconcerned in the region $b\\ge 0$, at which gravitational interaction has\nalready started causing the galaxies to cluster. Thus for this work the value\nof $<\\Delta N>$ is positive. Similarly, the energy fluctuations $<\\Delta U>$\ncan also be both positive and negative. For large correlations, the overdense\nregions typically have negative total energy and underdense regions have\nusually positive total energy. The critical value at which this switch occurs\nhas been calculated analytically. The results obtained by fluctuation theory\nclosely match with those obtained earlier by Specific heat analysis and Lee\nYang theory. The evaluation has been extended to multicomponent systems, having\na variety of masses. It has been found that the gravitational clustering of\ngalaxies is more sensitive to mass ratios and less sensitive to galaxies number\ndensities. This means there is little effect of $\\nu$ (number density) but\nsignificant effect of $\\mu$ (mass) on the clustering phenomenon. The clustering\nof galaxies is quicker when mass of individual galaxies increases. As the mass\nof galaxies increases, the transition from positive to negative energy occurs\nat a higher stage of clustering as compared to a single component system.",

However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations\nand the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the\nrelative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most\nexisting stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax\neffectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image\nstitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on\nthe novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry\ngrounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain\nboth intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene\nreconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto\na designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving\npixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to\nfurther address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial\nstitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the\nrefined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large\nparallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric\nintegrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct\napplicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM.

One vital component often found in such document processing\nworkflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,\nremains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain\nthe decisions of document image classification models through\nfeature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail\nto provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this\npaper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document\ncounterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's\ndecision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose\nDocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination\nwith classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual\ncounterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise\nrefinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target\nfactual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a\nrigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document\nclassification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3\ndifferent models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established\nevaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism.

Unlike traditional unimodal\ncontinual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal\nfeature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and\nzero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and\nsystematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL).

We further analyze current\nevaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better\nbenchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional\ngeneralization.

These oscillations are the most susceptible to the\nChandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) instability driven by gravitational wave\nemission, which makes them promising targets for current and future\ngravitational wave searches. In order to develop, the instability must overcome\ndissipative processes within the star. As a result, $r$-modes become unstable\nonly for certain combinations of stellar angular velocity $\\Omega$ and\n(redshifted) temperature $T^\\infty$, defining the so-called instability window\non the $(\\Omega, T^\\infty)$ plane. At high temperatures, bulk viscosity\n$\\zeta$, arising from out-of-equilibrium chemical reactions, is the dominant\ndissipative agent. Dissipation due to $\\zeta$ can be greatly enhanced by two\nindependent mechanisms: (1) the presence of hyperons, which significantly\nincreases the bulk viscosity, and (2) the distinctive properties of\nrelativistic $r$-modes in nonbarotropic matter, which further amplify\ndissipation beyond Newtonian predictions. In this work, we present the first\ninvestigation of the combined impact of these mechanisms on $r$-mode\ninstability windows. Our calculations also account for the fact that chemical\nreactions modify the adiabatic index, in addition to producing bulk viscosity.\nWe further estimate the influence of nucleon pairing effects on the instability\nwindows. By comparing our predictions with recent observations of neutron stars\nin low-mass X-ray binaries, we find that bulk viscosity in hyperonic matter may\nprovide the necessary dissipation to stabilize $r$-modes in the\nfastest-spinning and moderately hot stars, even when nucleon superfluidity and\nsuperconductivity are taken into account.

To address the estimation challenges posed\nby these channel conditions, a novel algorithm is proposed:\nVisibility-Region-HMM-Aided Polar-Domain Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching\nPursuit (VR-HMM-P-SOMP). The method extends a greedy sparse recovery framework\nby integrating VR estimation through a hidden Markov model (HMM), using a novel\nemission formulation and Viterbi decoding. This allows the algorithm to\nadaptively mask steering vectors and account for spatial non-stationarity at\nthe antenna level. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method\nenhances estimation accuracy compared to existing techniques, particularly in\nlow-SNR and sparse scenarios, while maintaining a low computational complexity.\nThe algorithm presents robustness across a range of design parameters and\nchannel conditions, offering a practical solution for ELAA systems.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems learn from past user behavior to predict future user\npreferences. Intuitively, it has been established that the most recent\ninteractions are more indicative of future preferences than older interactions.\nMany recommendation algorithms use this notion to either drop older\ninteractions or to assign them a lower weight, so the model can focus on the\nmore informative, recent information. However, very few approaches model the\nflow of time explicitly.\n  This paper analyzes how time can be encoded in factorization-style\nrecommendation models. By including absolute time as a feature, our models can\nlearn varying user preferences and changing item perception over time. In\naddition to simple binning approaches, we also propose a novel, fully\ncontinuous time encoding mechanism. Through the use of a polynomial fit inside\nthe loss function, our models completely avoid the need for discretization, and\nthey are able to capture the time dimension in arbitrary resolution.\n  We perform a comparative study on three real-world datasets that span\nmultiple years, where long user histories are present, and items stay relevant\nfor a longer time. Empirical results show that, by explicitly modeling time,\nour models are very effective at capturing temporal signals, such as varying\nitem popularities over time. Despite this however, our experiments also\nindicate that a simple post-hoc popularity adjustment is often sufficient to\nachieve the best performance on the unseen test set. This teaches us that, for\nthe recommendation task, predicting the future is more important than capturing\npast trends. As such, we argue that specialized mechanisms are needed for\nextrapolation to future data.",

We analyze the redistribution of EPs caused by sawtooth crashes\nand the effect of EPs on sawtooth behavior and type transitions. The results\nshow that co-passing EPs tend to re-excite sawtooth oscillations, extending\ntheir period, while counter-passing EPs promote the system evolution toward\nsmall sawteeth, potentially leading to the steady-island state. Additionally,\nwe provide a physical picture of how EPs influence sawtooth type through the\nmechanism of magnetic flux pumping. We demonstrate that the radial residual\nflow in the core plays a crucial role in determining the reconnection rate and\nsawtooth type. Moreover, we observe new phenomena about couplings of various\ninstabilities, such as the excitation of global multi-mode toroidal Alfv\\'en\neigenmodes (TAEs) due to EP redistribution following a sawtooth crash and the\nexcitation of the resonant tearing mode (r-TM) when injecting counter-passing\nEPs. The study also explores the impact of EP energy and the safety factor\nprofile on the development of stochastic magnetic fields and EP transport.\nThese findings emphasize the necessity of multi-mode simulations in capturing\nthe complexity of EP-sawtooth interactions and provide insights for optimizing\nsawtooth control in future reactors such as ITER.",

    "abstract": "As deep learning-based, data-driven information extraction systems become\nincreasingly integrated into modern document processing workflows, one primary\nconcern is the risk of malicious leakage of sensitive private data from these\nsystems. While some recent works have explored Differential Privacy (DP) to\nmitigate these privacy risks, DP-based training is known to cause significant\nperformance degradation and impose several limitations on standard training\nprocedures, making its direct application to downstream tasks both difficult\nand costly. In this work, we aim to address the above challenges within the\ncontext of document image classification by substituting real private data with\na synthetic counterpart. In particular, we propose to use conditional latent\ndiffusion models (LDMs) in combination with differential privacy (DP) to\ngenerate class-specific synthetic document images under strict privacy\nconstraints, which can then be utilized to train a downstream classifier\nfollowing standard training procedures. We investigate our approach under\nvarious pretraining setups, including unconditional, class-conditional, and\nlayout-conditional pretraining, in combination with multiple private training\nstrategies such as class-conditional and per-label private fine-tuning with\nDPDM and DP-Promise algorithms. Additionally, we evaluate it on two well-known\ndocument benchmark datasets, RVL-CDIP and Tobacco3482, and show that it can\ngenerate useful and realistic document samples across various document types\nand privacy levels ($\\varepsilon \\in \\{1, 5, 10\\}$).

Transfer-based\nattacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these\nexamples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that\nadversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability\nto alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook\nthe influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation\nAttack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction\nto guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.\nSpecifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input\ngradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which\nencompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying\non the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation\ndirection, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient\nand the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation\ndirection. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of\nResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the\ntransferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current\ninput transformation methods.

In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for\nenhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and\nreasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset\ndependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates\ngrounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object\nlocalization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then\nbuilds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning\naccuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning\npath to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought\n(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby\nreducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.\nFinally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates\nanswer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess\nwhether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our\nexperiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves\nperformance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA.

Second,\nwe develop a shape-adaptive reduced basis method (RBM) that utilizes the\neigenfunctions of the Neumann-Poincar\\'{e} operator for forward problems and\ntheir adjoint counterparts for adjoint problems, thereby addressing\nsingularities and accelerating computations. Third, we propose a\nphysics-informed initialization strategy that estimates nanoparticle\nconfigurations under weak coupling assumptions, thereby improving the\nperformance of gradient-based optimization algorithms. The method's\ncomputational advantages are demonstrated through numerical experiments, which\nshow accurate and efficient designs across various geometric configurations.\nFurthermore, the framework is flexible and extensible to other material systems\nand boundary conditions.",

Yet, this is impractical due to significant\ncomputational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning\nhas emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by\nselectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while\npreserving required capabilities on normal cases.

Despite growing interest, the scope of the deep research\ntask remains underdefined and its distinction from other reasoning-intensive\nproblems is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a formal\ncharacterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to\nevaluate the performance of DR systems. We argue that the core defining feature\nof deep research is not the production of lengthy report-style outputs, but\nrather the high fan-out over concepts required during the search process, i.e.,\nbroad and reasoning-intensive exploration. To enable objective evaluation, we\ndefine DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims\nuncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level\nreport generation. Based on this formulation, we propose a diverse, challenging\nbenchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics (e.g.,\ndatasets, materials discovery, prior art search) and public interest events\n(e.g., flight incidents, movie awards). Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1\nscore ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model\nperforms the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55.

The increased\ncost is driven by improved broadband detector sensitivity, particularly at low\nfrequencies due to advances in detector commissioning, resulting in longer\nin-band signals and a higher detection rate. Waveform models now incorporate\nfeatures like higher-order modes, further increasing the complexity of standard\ninference methods. Our framework employs meshfree likelihood interpolation with\nradial basis functions to accelerate Bayesian inference using the IMRPhenomXHM\nwaveform model that incorporates higher modes of the gravitational-wave signal.\nIn the initial start-up stage, interpolation nodes are placed within a\nconstant-match metric ellipsoid in the intrinsic parameter space. During\nsampling, likelihood is evaluated directly using the precomputed interpolants,\nbypassing the costly steps of on-the-fly waveform generation and\noverlap-integral computation. We improve efficiency by sampling in a rotated\nparameter space aligned with the eigenbasis of the metric ellipsoid, where\nparameters are uncorrelated by construction. This speeds up sampler\nconvergence. This method yields unbiased parameter recovery when applied to 100\nsimulated neutron-star-black-hole signals (NSBH) in LIGO-Virgo data, while\nreducing computational cost by up to an order of magnitude for the\nlongest-duration signal. The meshfree framework equally applies to symmetric\ncompact binary systems dominated by the quadrupole mode, supporting parameter\nestimation across a broad range of sources.

    "abstract": "The increasing vulnerability of electrical distribution systems to extreme\nweather events and cyber threats necessitates the development of economically\nviable frameworks for resilience enhancement. While existing approaches focus\nprimarily on technical resilience metrics and enhancement strategies, there\nremains a significant gap in establishing market-driven mechanisms that can\neffectively commercialize resilience features while optimizing their deployment\nthrough intelligent decision-making. Moreover, traditional optimization\napproaches for distribution network reconfiguration often fail to dynamically\nadapt to both normal and emergency conditions. This paper introduces a novel\nframework integrating dual-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with\nmarket-based mechanisms, achieving an average resilience score of 0.85 0.08\nover 10 test episodes. The proposed architecture leverages a dual-agent PPO\nscheme, where a strategic agent selects optimal DER-driven switching\nconfigurations, while a tactical agent fine-tunes individual switch states and\ngrid preferences under budget and weather constraints. These agents interact\nwithin a custom-built dynamic simulation environment that models stochastic\ncalamity events, budget limits, and resilience-cost trade-offs. A comprehensive\nreward function is designed that balances resilience enhancement objectives\nwith market profitability (with up to 200x reward incentives, resulting in 85%\nof actions during calamity steps selecting configurations with 4 DERs),\nincorporating factors such as load recovery speed, system robustness, and\ncustomer satisfaction. Over 10 test episodes, the framework achieved a\nbenefit-cost ratio of 0.12 0.01, demonstrating sustainable market incentives\nfor resilience investment. This framework creates sustainable market incentives",

These\nsystems will serve as verification sources for the Laser Interferometer Space\nAntenna (LISA). To significantly improve the electromagnetic (EM) constraints\non these two systems and the LISA detectability predictions, we conducted\nspectroscopic follow-up observations using HST/STIS, Keck I/LRIS, and Keck\nII/ESI. Our analysis significantly improves the temperature, surface gravity,\nand mass constraints for both primary and secondary components in J2322+0509,\nas well as dynamical properties such as radial velocities and orbital periods\nin both systems. For J2322+0509, we derive an updated inclination of $i$ =\n25$^{+4.5}_{-3.0}$ deg, while for J0634+3803, we obtain $i$ =\n43$^{+7.0}_{-5.6}$ deg. We assess the detectability of these sources using\nLDASOFT. Incorporating EM priors on inclination significantly enhances the\ngravitational wave signal recovery, reducing uncertainties in amplitude by a\nfactor of 2-4 and shortening the detection time by up to a few months. Our\nresults underscore the importance of multi-messenger observations in\ncharacterizing double white dwarf binaries and maximizing LISA's early\nscientific capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Gradient inversion attacks pose significant privacy threats to distributed\ntraining frameworks such as federated learning, enabling malicious parties to\nreconstruct sensitive local training data from gradient communications between\nclients and an aggregation server during the aggregation process. While\ntraditional encryption-based defenses, such as homomorphic encryption, offer\nstrong privacy guarantees without compromising model utility, they often incur\nprohibitive computational overheads. To mitigate this, selective encryption has\nemerged as a promising approach, encrypting only a subset of gradient data\nbased on the data's significance under a certain metric. However, there have\nbeen few systematic studies on how to specify this metric in practice. This\npaper systematically evaluates selective encryption methods with different\nsignificance metrics against state-of-the-art attacks. Our findings demonstrate\nthe feasibility of selective encryption in reducing computational overhead\nwhile maintaining resilience against attacks. We propose a distance-based\nsignificance analysis framework that provides theoretical foundations for\nselecting critical gradient elements for encryption. Through extensive\nexperiments on different model architectures (LeNet, CNN, BERT, GPT-2) and\nattack types, we identify gradient magnitude as a generally effective metric\nfor protection against optimization-based gradient inversions.

    "abstract": "In this thesis, we develop analytical methods to study out-of-equilibrium\nstochastic processes driven by colored noise, i.e., noise with temporal\ncorrelations. These non-Markovian processes pose significant analytical\nchallenges compared to processes driven by white noise, such as Brownian\nmotion. A primary focus is on active particle systems, specifically the\nrun-and-tumble particle subjected to an arbitrary force. We derive exact\nexpressions for its mean first-passage time (MFPT) and exit probability from an\ninterval using the backward Fokker-Planck equation. Remarkably, we find that\nthe MFPT can be optimized as a function of the tumbling rate. Additionally, we\ninvestigate stochastic resetting and switching diffusion models. For switching\ndiffusion models which are examples of \"Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusions\",\nwe use a renewal approach and large deviation theory to derive exact results\nfor various observables. These include the distribution of the position of the\nparticle and its moments, but also its cumulants which are key observables to\ncharacterize non-Gaussian fluctuations. Notably, we uncover an unexpected\nconnection between this model and free cumulants. We also examine these models\nin the presence of a harmonic potential by using Kesten variables. This\napproach enables us to write an integral equation for the steady-state\ndistribution, which we solve in specific cases. Furthermore, we extend Siegmund\nduality - a concept that is not widely known in the physics literature - to\nactive particles, random diffusion models, stochastic resetting, and\ncontinuous-time random walks. This duality establishes a direct relation\nbetween first passage observables and the spatial properties of a dual process,\nwhich we explicitly construct.",

Most\nexisting pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing\nsimilar parameters while merging divergent ones. However, this paradigm\ninevitably induces inter-weight conflicts and leads to catastrophic domain\nforgetting. While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it\nstruggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when\nthe weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting\nin the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA\nFusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with\nin-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,\nwhich dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains\nthrough learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task\nvector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the\norientation of the task vectors. Subsequently, the fused LoRA is reconstructed\nby a self-designed Fusion VAE (F-VAE) to realize multi-task LoRA generation. We\nhave conducted extensive experiments on visual and linguistic tasks, and the\nexperimental results demonstrate that ICM-Fusion can be adapted to a wide range\nof architectural models and applied to various tasks.

They primarily benefit a small subset of\nusers with abundant search behavior, while offering limited improvements for\nthe majority of users who exhibit only sparse search activity. To address the\nproblem of sparse search data in search-enhanced recommendation, we face two\nkey challenges: (1) how to learn useful search features for users with sparse\nsearch interactions, and (2) how to design effective training objectives under\nsparse conditions. Our idea is to leverage the features of users with rich\nsearch interactions to enhance those of users with sparse search interactions.\nBased on this idea, we propose GSERec, a method that utilizes message passing\non the User-Code Graphs to alleviate data sparsity in Search-Enhanced\nRecommendation. Specifically, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) with\nvector quantization to generate discrete codes, which connect similar users and\nthereby construct the graph. Through message passing on this graph, embeddings\nof users with rich search data are propagated to enhance the embeddings of\nusers with sparse interactions. To further ensure that the message passing\ncaptures meaningful information from truly similar users, we introduce a\ncontrastive loss to better model user similarities.

    "abstract": "Advances in speech representation and large language models have enhanced\nzero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) performance. However, existing zero-shot TTS\nmodels face challenges in capturing the complex correlations between acoustic\nand semantic features, resulting in a lack of expressiveness and similarity.\nThe primary reason lies in the complex relationship between semantic and\nacoustic features, which manifests independent and interdependent aspects.This\npaper introduces a TTS framework that combines both autoregressive (AR) and\nnon-autoregressive (NAR) modules to harmonize the independence and\ninterdependence of acoustic and semantic information. The AR model leverages\nthe proposed Parallel Tokenizer to synthesize the top semantic and acoustic\ntokens simultaneously. In contrast, considering the interdependence, the\nCoupled NAR model predicts detailed tokens based on the general AR model's\noutput. Parallel GPT, built on this architecture, is designed to improve\nzero-shot text-to-speech synthesis through its parallel structure. Experiments\non English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that the proposed model\nsignificantly outperforms the quality and efficiency of the synthesis of\nexisting zero-shot TTS models.

    "abstract": "Cell type annotation is a fundamental step in the analysis of single-cell RNA\nsequencing (scRNA-seq) data. In practice, human experts often rely on the\nstructure revealed by principal component analysis (PCA) followed by\n$k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) graph construction to guide annotation. While\neffective, this process is labor-intensive and does not scale to large\ndatasets. Recent advances in CLIP-style models offer a promising path toward\nautomating cell type annotation. By aligning scRNA-seq profiles with natural\nlanguage descriptions, models like LangCell enable zero-shot annotation. While\nLangCell demonstrates decent zero-shot performance, its predictions remain\nsuboptimal, particularly in achieving consistent accuracy across all cell\ntypes. In this paper, we propose to refine the zero-shot logits produced by\nLangCell through a graph-regularized optimization framework. By enforcing local\nconsistency over the task-specific PCA-based k-NN graph, our method combines\nthe scalability of the pre-trained models with the structural robustness relied\nupon in expert annotation. We evaluate our approach on 14 annotated human\nscRNA-seq datasets from 4 distinct studies, spanning 11 organs and over 200,000\nsingle cells. Our method consistently improves zero-shot annotation accuracy,\nachieving accuracy gains of up to 10%. Further analysis showcase the mechanism\nby which GRIT effectively propagates correct signals through the graph, pulling\nback mislabeled cells toward more accurate predictions. The method is\ntraining-free, model-agnostic, and serves as a simple yet effective plug-in for\nenhancing automated cell type annotation in practice.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the\nintroduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging\nrule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions\nand guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across\nmany replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses\nunder a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or\nincorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to\nvanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for\nlearning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.\nTo address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization\nframework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome\nconsistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs\nshow high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives\nmeaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and\nself-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we\nincorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances\nlocal advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic\ntransitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method\nintroduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization\nstrategy.

Recent works\nmostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance\ngain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with\nthis, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that\nreformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the\nCategory-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the\nopen-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a\nstructured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features\ndistinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought\nprompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and\nenhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each\nimage into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature\nrepresentation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot\nsamples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and\ntext encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by\nretrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad\ncompatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization\nand adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12\nFGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot\nCLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.",

Neuro-MoBRE\nincorporates a brain-regional-temporal embedding mechanism combined with a\nmixture-of-experts approach, assigning neural signals from distinct brain\nregions to specialized regional experts on a unified embedding basis, thus\nexplicitly resolving both structural and functional heterogeneity.\nAdditionally, our region-masked autoencoding pre-training strategy further\nenhances representational consistency among subjects, complemented by a\ntask-disentangled information aggregation method tailored to effectively handle\ntask-specific neural variations. Evaluations conducted on intracranial\nrecordings from 11 subjects across five diverse tasks, including complex\nlanguage decoding and epileptic seizure diagnosis, demonstrate that Neuro-MoBRE\nsurpasses prior art and exhibits robust generalization for zero-shot decoding\non unseen subjects.",

While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the\nworst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and\nenables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows\ntwo composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of\nminimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis.\nCompared to state-of-the-art synthesis solvers, our framework is able to solve\na notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle. A detailed\nanalysis shows that both composition variants have unique merits.",

    "abstract": "Affective computing is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary research\ndirection in the field of brain-computer interface. In recent years, the\nintroduction of deep learning technology has greatly promoted the development\nof the field of emotion recognition. However, due to physiological differences\nbetween subjects, as well as the variations in experimental environments and\nequipment, cross-corpus emotion recognition faces serious challenges,\nespecially for samples near the decision boundary. To solve the above problems,\nwe propose an optimization method based on domain adversarial transfer learning\nto fine-grained alignment of affective features, named Maximum classifier\ndiscrepancy with Pairwise Learning (McdPL) framework. In McdPL, we design a\ndual adversarial classifier (Ada classifier and RMS classifier), and apply a\nthree-stage adversarial training to maximize classification discrepancy and\nminimize feature distribution to align controversy samples near the decision\nboundary. In the process of domain adversarial training, the two classifiers\nalso maintain an adversarial relationship, ultimately enabling precise\ncross-corpus feature alignment. In addition, the introduction of pairwise\nlearning transforms the classification problem of samples into a similarity\nproblem between samples, alleviating the influence of label noise. We conducted\nsystematic experimental evaluation of the model using publicly available SEED,\nSEED-IV and SEED-V databases. The results show that the McdPL model is superior\nto other baseline models in the cross-corpus emotion recognition task, and the\naverage accuracy improvements of 4.76\\% and 3.97\\%, respectively. Our work\nprovides a promising solution for emotion recognition cross-corpus. The source\ncode is available at https://github.com/WuCB-BCI/Mcd_PL.",

We further introduced M3F (Multi-Modal Model for Few-shot\nlearning framework), a novel Large Multi-Modal Model framework tailored for\ndata-constrained scientific applications. M3F supports a wide range of\nscientific data types through a modular pipeline. By fine-tuning the model on\nM3FD, M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL\ndeployment.

Existing approaches to bridge\nthis gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction\ntechniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single\nmodality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality\nmisalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this\npaper, we propose \\textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\\underline{N}teracted qu\\underline{E}ry\n\\underline{A}daptation with o\\underline{R}thogona\\underline{L} Regularization),\na novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two\ncontributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which\ndynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between\nmodalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal\nmedical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA).

Experimental results show that our approach reduces\n2Q-count overhead by 54.8%, 15.3%, and 68.0% compared to tableau-based,\nZX-calculus-based, and path-sum-based QCO algorithms, respectively. In terms of\nruntime, our method achieves speedups of 1.81$\\times$ and 13.1$\\times$ over the\ntableau-based and ZX-calculus-based methods, while performing comparably to the\npath-sum-based approach. In summary, the proposed lazy resynthesis technique\nnot only enhances the quality and performance of tableau-based QCO algorithms\nbut also demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability compared to\nalternative QCO approaches such as ZX-calculus and path-sum-based techniques.",

    "abstract": "The urban canopy affects wind in complex ways, making it challenging to\npredict wind-driven natural ventilation and cooling in buildings. Using large\neddy simulations of coupled outdoor and indoor airflow, we study how the\nsurrounding urban canopy and wind angle influence ventilation rates through\nfour ventilation configurations: cross, corner, dual-room, and single-sided.\nFlow visualizations demonstrate how both large-scale flow patterns and local\ninterference effects can influence ventilation rates by 50-85%. In general,\nlower density canopies give higher ventilation rates and wind angles that align\nwith a direct path between two openings also lead to higher ventilation rates.\nHowever, interference effects from surrounding buildings can significantly\nchange the local wind speed and direction, thus also changing ventilation\nrates. The magnitude of these interference effects depends on both the wind\nangle and surrounding building geometries. The effect of wind angle is less\npronounced in a higher density canopy, where the urban canopy geometry more\nstrongly guides the flow. The results demonstrate that the canopy's effect on\nventilation rates is much more complex than those suggested by existing natural\nventilation parameterizations.",

To address these\ndeficiencies, we introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model\n(GM-PRM), a novel paradigm that transforms the PRM from a passive judge into an\nactive reasoning collaborator. Instead of a simple scalar score, GM-PRM\nprovides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step,\nevaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness. More\ncritically, GM-PRM is trained to generate a corrected version of the first\nerroneous step it identifies. This unique corrective capability enables our new\ntest-time inference strategy, Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN). This framework\nactively enhances solution quality by using the PRM's generated correction to\nguide the policy model toward a more promising reasoning trajectory, thereby\nimproving the diversity and correctness of the solution pool. We demonstrate\nthat GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal math\nbenchmarks, significantly boosting policy model performance with remarkable\ndata efficiency, requiring only a 20K-sample training dataset.

We analyse the\nefficiency of turbulence for different flows using numerical and experimental\ndata.

In the case of pipe flow, we\nshow that saturation of the efficiency cannot be excluded, but would be\nincompatible with the Prandtl law of the drag friction coefficient.\nFurthermore, if the power law behaviour holds for the efficiency saturation, it\ncan explain the kinetic energy and the energy dissipation defect laws proposed\nfor the shear flows. Efficiency saturation is an interesting empirical property\nof turbulence that may help in evaluating the ''closeness'' of experimental and\nnumerical data to the true turbulent regime, wherein the kinetic energy\nsaturates to its inviscid limit.",

Here, we propose a generalisation of the Central\nDogma as a division of labour between the transmission and expression of\ninformation: the transmitter (nucleic acids) perpetuates information across\ngenerations, whereas the expressor (protein) enacts this information to\nfacilitate the transmitter's function without itself perpetuating information.\nWe argue that this generalisation offers two benefits. First, it provides a\nunifying perspective for comparing the Central Dogma to analogous divisions of\nlabour observed at vastly different biological scales, including multicellular\norganisms, eukaryotic cells, organelles, and bacteria. Second, it offers a\ntheoretical framework to explain the Central Dogma as an outcome of evolution.\nSpecifically, we review a mathematical model suggesting that the Central Dogma\noriginates through spontaneous symmetry breaking driven by evolutionary\nconflicts between different levels of selection. By reframing the Central Dogma\nas an informational relationship between components of a system, this\ngeneralisation underscores its broader relevance across the biological\nhierarchy and sheds light on its evolutionary origin.",

To address these issues,\nwe propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core\ngeographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into\nan iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed\ninto three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects\nrelevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that\nchooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in\nprevious rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative\nrefinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further\nrounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction\nquality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable\nrelationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property\nestimation to socioeconomic prediction. Experimental results show consistent\nimprovements over standard prompting strategies, demonstrating that\nincorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into\nLLMs leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions.

Under reasonable\nassumptions, our algorithm can simulate $\\ell$ reactions among $n$ total\nmolecules in time $O(\\ell/\\sqrt n)$ when $\\ell \\ge n^{5/4}$, and in time\n$O(\\ell/n^{2/5})$ when $n \\le \\ell \\le n^{5/4}$. Our work adapts an algorithm\nof Berenbrink, Hammer, Kaaser, Meyer, Penschuck, and Tran [ESA 2020] for\nsimulating the distributed computing model known as population protocols,\nextending it (in a very nontrivial way) to the more general chemical reaction\nnetwork setting.\n  We provide an implementation of our algorithm as a Python package, with the\ncore logic implemented in Rust, with remarkably fast performance in practice.",

We propose a quantum Hadamard test with the additional\ncapability to compute the inner product in bounded input space, which refers to\nthe Generalized Quantum Hadamard test. It incorporates not only\nL2-normalization of input space but also other standardization methods, such as\nMin-max normalization. This capability is raised due to different quantum\nfeature mapping and unitary evolution of the mapped quantum state. We discuss\nthe quantum circuital implementation of our algorithm and establish this\ncircuit design through numerical simulation. Our circuital architecture is\nefficient in terms of computational complexities. We show the application of\nour algorithm by integrating it with two classical machine learning models:\nLogistic regression binary classifier and Centroid-based binary classifier and\nsolve four classification problems over two public-benchmark datasets and two\nartificial datasets.",

    "abstract": "Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly\nresource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial\ncomputational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal\nperformance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a\nuseful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands\nextensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when\na single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements\nfor performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model\nversions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult\nto maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a\nnovel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify\ntheir performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from\ntraditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead,\nNNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you\ncontrolled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables\nmodel owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a\nbaseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced\ncapabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary\ncomputation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To\nvalidate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including\nimage classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation,\nusing well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable\nDiffusion.

Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla\nTransformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'\nability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features\ncritical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose\nan efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed\nTCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention\n(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention\nto dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This\nis achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,\nsignificantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's\nability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a\nDual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the\nstandard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,\nthereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability.

To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive\nInformation Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that\nintegrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether\nto retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs\na dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer\nand a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these\noutputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically\nimproving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a\ndual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and\nself-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information\nSelection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to\nboth sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance\nefficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy\nthrough contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.\nExperimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS\nreduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)\nwhile still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior\nbaselines on average.",

    "abstract": "Stars that contain only trace amounts of elements heavier than helium,\nreferred to as having low \"metallicity\", preserve the chemical fingerprints of\nthe first generation of stars and supernovae. In the Milky Way, the lowest\nmetallicity stars show an extreme over-abundance of carbon relative to other\nelements, which has been hypothesized to be a unique result of the first\nlow-energy supernovae. However, the origin of this signature has remained a\nmystery, since no such stars have been discovered in the ancient dwarf galaxies\nwhere they are thought to have formed. Here, we present observations of a star\nin the >10 billion year old ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Pictor II, that shows the\nlowest iron and calcium abundances outside the Milky Way (<1/43,000th solar and\n~1/160,000th solar), with a factor of >3000x relative carbon enhancement. As\nthe first unambiguous second-generation star in a relic dwarf galaxy, this\nobject demonstrates that carbon-enhanced second-generation stars can originate\nin primordial small-scale systems. This star supports the hypothesis that\ncarbon-enhancement is produced by low-energy-supernovae, since the yields of\nenergetic supernovae are harder to retain in small-scale environments. This key\nlocal signature of chemical enrichment by the first stars traces a regime\ninaccessible to current high-redshift observations, which cannot detect the\nearly enrichment of the smallest galaxies.",

First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion\nlexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D\nmesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign.

In this paper, we observe that the controllability of\ntexts generated by the powerful prefix-based method Air-Decoding tends to\ndecline with increasing sequence length, which we hypothesize primarily arises\nfrom the observed decay in attention to the prefixes. Meanwhile, different\ntypes of prefixes including soft and hard prefixes are also key factors\ninfluencing performance. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight\nand effective framework called Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA)\nbased on Air-Decoding for controllable text generation. Specifically, it first\nselects the optimal prefix type for a given task. Then we dynamically amplify\nthe attention to the prefix for the attribute distribution to enhance\ncontrollability, with a scaling factor growing exponentially as the sequence\nlength increases. Moreover, based on the task, we optionally apply a similar\naugmentation to the original prompt for the raw distribution to balance text\nquality. After attribute distribution reconstruction, the generated text\nsatisfies the attribute constraints well.

It is a fundamental problem in\nagent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze\nintelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the\nprimary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents\nrepresented by population members. However, when the number of attributes\ndescribing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the\njoint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of\ndimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and\nproduce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from\navailable sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute\ncombinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the\nsample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of\nfalsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in\nthe population (called structural zeros).

ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR\nwithout any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on\n8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering\nclear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.\nAblation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as\na promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.\nOur codes are available at https://github.com/zechenli03/ZARA.",

A particular challenge arises in\nscenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as\nthese parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions.

To address this, reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache for\nimproved inference efficiency has become a mainstream approach. Recent advances\nfurther enhance throughput by sparse attention mechanisms to select the most\nrelevant KV Cache, thereby reducing sequence length. However, such techniques\nare limited to single-context scenarios, where historical KV Cache is computed\nsequentially with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents as context are unknown\nbeforehand, each document's KV Cache is computed and stored independently\n(termed multiple-context KV Cache), lacking cross-attention between contexts.\nThis renders existing methods ineffective. Although prior work partially\nrecomputes multiple-context KV Cache to mitigate accuracy loss from missing\ncross-attention, it requires retaining all KV Cache throughout, failing to\nreduce memory overhead. This paper presents SamKV, the first exploration of\nattention sparsification for multiple-context KV Cache. Specifically, SamKV\ntakes into account the complementary information of other contexts when\nsparsifying one context, and then locally recomputes the sparsified\ninformation.

Nine receiver sites (four of them inside the totality path)\nwere deployed to collect the data in different transmitter-receiver\nconfigurations relative to the totality path, which intersected with the radio\npropagation paths from the Cutler, MA (NAA, 24 kHz) and the LaMoure, ND (NML,\n25.2 kHz) Navy transmitters.

The novelty of the\nobservations is the near-total obscuration of one of the transmitters and\nobservations of several radio propagation paths closely aligned to the path of\ntotality.

To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning\nwith Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning\nframework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically\nadjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the\nperformance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,\nDCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained\nrepresentation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it\ndynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image\nmutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces\nnegative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to\nlearn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the\nFine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging\nbenchmark for ITR in downstream data domains.

The dataset consists of GUI task trajectories across both desktop\nand web, annotated by human experts.

    "abstract": "In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete\nground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task\nis severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and\nhigh inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete\nsegmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class\nrepresentations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging\nclass-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations\nand a neglect of target structural information.\n  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network\n(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete\nground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its\nvariant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key\nmodules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures\nsemantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract\nunbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure\nCoordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,\nstructure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic\ncognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the\nsemantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.\nFinally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic\nstep-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between\nclasses.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods.

The calculations\nshow that $\\beta$ and $\\lambda$ strongly influence velocity distributions,\nshifting peaks, creating double-peak structures, or enhancing dark matter\ndominance in the bulge or disk.

We examine four scenarios: Yukawa gravity without dark matter,\ndark matter with non-trivial coupling, fully modified gravity, and standard\nNewtonian gravity. Results show that MW models with $\\lambda < 1$ kpc yield\nhigh Bayes factors but risk overfitting, as dark matter mimics baryonic\nkinematics, while M31's photometric priors from conjugate observations mitigate\nthis, yielding robust parameter estimates.

By\nvarying Au and Ag thicknesses (10-50nm) across a spectral range of 300-1500nm,\nwe generate spatial absorption maps and integrated power metrics from full-wave\nsolutions to Maxwell's equations. A multilayer perceptron models global\nabsorption behavior with a mean absolute error of 0.0953, while a convolutional\nneural network predicts spatial absorption distributions with an MAE of 0.0101.\nSHapley Additive exPlanations identify plasmonic layer thickness and excitation\nwavelength as dominant contributors to absorption, which peaks between 450 and\n850~nm. Gold demonstrates broader and more sustained absorption compared to\nsilver, although both metals exhibit reduced efficiency outside the resonance\nwindow. This integrated FDTD-ML framework offers a fast, explainable, and\naccurate approach for investigating tunable plasmonic behavior in multilayer\nsystems, with applications in optical sensing, photovoltaics, and nanophotonic\ndevice design.",

To explore how game context influences\noffensive performance, we analyze minute-by-minute event-sequenced match data\nfrom 15 seasons across five major European leagues. Using count-response\nGeneralized Additive Modeling, we consider features such as score and red card\ndifferential, home/away status, pre-match win probabilities, and game minute.\nMoreover, we leverage interaction terms to test several intuitive hypotheses\nabout how these features might cooperate in explaining offensive production.\nThe selected model is then applied to project offensive statistics onto a\nstandardized \"common denominator\" scenario: a tied home game with even men on\nboth sides. The adjusted numbers - in contrast to regular game totals that\ndisregard game context - offer a more contextualized comparison, reducing the\nlikelihood of misrepresenting the relative quality of play.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, blockchain has emerged as a promising solution for\nbuilding secure distributed ledgers and has attracted significant attention.\nHowever, current blockchain systems suffer from limited throughput, poor\nscalability, and high latency. Due to limitations in consensus mechanisms,\nespecially in managing node identities, blockchain is often considered\nunsuitable for applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper\nproposes the Advanced DAG-based Ranking (ADR) protocol to enhance blockchain\nscalability and throughput. ADR employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\nstructure where nodes are positioned based on their rankings. Unlike\ntraditional chains, ADR allows honest nodes to write blocks and verify\ntransactions using a DAG-based topology. The protocol follows a three-step\napproach to secure the network against double-spending and enhance performance.\nFirst, it verifies nodes using their public and private keys before granting\nentry. Second, it builds an advanced DAG ledger enabling block production and\ntransaction validation. Third, a ranking algorithm filters out malicious nodes,\nranks the remaining nodes based on performance, and arranges them\ntopologically. This process increases throughput and ensures robust\nscalability. We evaluated ADR on Amazon EC2 clusters with over 100 nodes,\nincluding scenarios with injected malicious nodes. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that ADR significantly improves transaction throughput and network\nliveness compared to existing DAG-based blockchains such as IOTA and ByteBall,\nmaking it well-suited for IoT applications.",

It arises from\nJaynes' maximum-entropy principle as the maximally entropic state subject to\nlinear constraints, and is also the reduced state of the microcanonical state\non the system and a large environment. We formulate a maximum-channel-entropy\nprinciple, defining a thermal channel as one that maximizes a channel entropy\nmeasure subject to linear constraints on the channel. We prove that thermal\nchannels exhibit an exponential form reminiscent of thermal states. We study\nexamples including thermalizing channels that conserve a state's average\nenergy, as well as Pauli-covariant and classical channels. We propose a quantum\nchannel learning algorithm based on maximum channel entropy methods that\nmirrors a similar learning algorithm for quantum states. We then demonstrate\nthe thermodynamic relevance of the maximum-channel-entropy channel by proving\nthat it resembles the action on a single system of a microcanonical channel\nacting on many copies of the system. Here, the microcanonical channel is\ndefined by requiring that the linear constraints obey sharp statistics for any\ni.i.d. input state, including for noncommuting constraint operators. Our\ntechniques involve convex optimization methods to optimize recently introduced\nchannel entropy measures, typicality techniques involving noncommuting\noperators, a custom channel postselection technique, as well as Schur-Weyl\nduality. As a result of potential independent interest, we prove a constrained\npostselection theorem for quantum channels.

    "abstract": "User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy\npreferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over\ntime. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement\nUnit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously\ncollect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user\nbehaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor\ndata, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large\nquantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user\nagency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable,\nfew-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify\nand modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive\n(black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed).\nLeveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU\nsensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding\nspace, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a\nprivacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided\nactivity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the\noriginal data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a\nnon-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity\nrecognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline\nmethods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.",

The partition scheme calculates the optimal partition\nsize by combining the node reputation value and divides the node into several\ndisjoint partitions according to the node reputation value. By selecting the\nappropriate partition size, RSPC provides a mechanism to ensure that each\npartition is valid, as long as themaximum permissible threshold for the failed\nnode is observed. At the same time, the RSPC reorganizes the network\nperiodically to avoid partition attacks. In addition, for cross-partition\ntransactions, this paper innovatively proposes a four-stage confirmation\nprotocol to ensure the efficient and safe completion of cross-partition\ntransactions.
