    "abstract": "Task and motion planning under Signal Temporal Logic constraints is known to\nbe NP-hard. A common class of approaches formulates these hybrid problems,\nwhich involve discrete task scheduling and continuous motion planning, as\nmixed-integer programs (MIP). However, in applications for bipedal locomotion,\nintroduction of non-convex constraints such as kinematic reachability and\nfootstep rotation exacerbates the computational complexity of MIPs. In this\nwork, we present a method based on Benders Decomposition to address scenarios\nwhere solving the entire monolithic optimization problem is prohibitively\nintractable. Benders Decomposition proposes an iterative cutting-plane\ntechnique that partitions the problem into a master problem to prototype a plan\nthat meets the task specification, and a series of subproblems for kinematics\nand dynamics feasibility checks. Our experiments demonstrate that this method\nachieves faster planning compared to alternative algorithms for solving the\nresulting optimization program with nonlinear constraints.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial\nconcordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and\nstatistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of\nchirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1)\nUnsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with\nadaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on\nspectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and\ntemporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both\nexact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating\nhemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that\nthe LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects\noutliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming\nexact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)\nwere highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those\nwith successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas\nfailure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The\nkey takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted\nspatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization,\nparticularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Time-resolution protocol of quantum sensing aims to measure the fast temporal\nvariation of an external field and demands a high field sensitivity in a short\ninterrogation time $\\tau$. Since any operation that evolves the quantum state\ntakes time and is counted as part of the interrogation, evaluating the\nperformance of time-resolution protocol requires a complete end-to-end\ndescription of the measurement process. In particular, the initial state has to\nbe one of the sensor qubit's eigenstates in the absence of external fields, and\nthe final projective measurements must be performed in the same eigenstate\nbasis. Building upon prior works which proposed limits for time-resolved\nsensing using a quantum sensor, we apply optimal control theory to optimize the\ntime-resolution protocol. Our analysis indicates that there exists a critical\ninterrogation time $T^*$: when $\\tau<T^*$ the optimal protocol is purely\nbang-bang; when $\\tau>T^*$ the optimal protocol involves a singular control\nduring the interrogation. In the short-$\\tau$ regime, which is relevant to high\ntime resolution, we propose a ``detune protocol'' that involves only smooth\ncontrol during the entire interrogation. As the discontinuities of control pose\nthe main obstacles to experimental realization, we expect the presented detune\nprotocol to be practically useful. In the long-$\\tau$ regime, the optimal\nprotocol closely resembles the Ramsey sequence; protocols based on maximizing\nQuantum Fisher Information are constructed to highlight the difference between\nthe theoretically optimal and practically implementable measurements. Effective\nuse of the time-resolution protocol requires a setup where the unknown\ntime-domain signal of interest can be identically and repeatedly generated. As\na potentially relevant application, we outline the calibration of baseband flux\npulse distortion in the control of superconducting qubits.",

Yet this rise in\npopularity contrasts with the reality that a substantial segment of the global\npopulation still lacks Internet access. The emergence of Low Earth orbit\nSatellite Networks (LSNs), such as SpaceX's Starlink and Amazon's Project\nKuiper, presents a promising solution to fill this gap. Nevertheless, our\nmeasurement study reveals that existing live streaming platforms may not be\nable to deliver a smooth viewing experience on LSNs due to frequent satellite\nhandovers, which lead to frequent video rebuffering events. Current\nstate-of-the-art learning-based Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithms, even when\ntrained on LSNs' network traces, fail to manage the abrupt network variations\nassociated with satellite handovers effectively. To address these challenges,\nfor the first time, we introduce Satellite-Aware Rate Adaptation (SARA), a\nversatile and lightweight middleware that can seamlessly integrate with various\nABR algorithms to enhance the performance of live streaming over LSNs. SARA\nintelligently modulates video playback speed and furnishes ABR algorithms with\ninsights derived from the distinctive network characteristics of LSNs, thereby\naiding ABR algorithms in making informed bitrate selections and effectively\nminimizing rebuffering events that occur during satellite handovers. Our\nextensive evaluation shows that SARA can effectively reduce the rebuffering\ntime by an average of $39.41\\%$ and slightly improve latency by $0.65\\%$ while\nonly introducing an overall loss in bitrate by $0.13\\%$.",

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of scientific literature has made it increasingly\ndifficult for researchers to keep up with the literature. In an attempt to\nalleviate this problem, we propose CASPER, a sparse retrieval model for\nscientific search that utilizes tokens and keyphrases as representation units\n(i.e. dimensions in the sparse embedding space), enabling it to represent\nqueries and documents with research concepts and match them at both granular\nand conceptual levels. To overcome the lack of suitable training data, we\npropose mining training data by leveraging scholarly references (i.e. signals\nthat capture how research concepts of papers are expressed in different\nsettings), including titles, citation contexts, author-assigned keyphrases, and\nco-citations. CASPER outperforms strong dense and sparse retrieval baselines on\neight scientific retrieval benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate that through\nsimple post-processing, CASPER can be effectively used for the keyphrase\ngeneration tasks, achieving competitive performance with the established\nCopyRNN while producing more diverse keyphrases and being nearly four times\nfaster.",

Kerr-nonlinear microresonators further enable the\ngeneration of portable, integrated optical frequency combs, which are called\nmicrocombs. However, the dispersion engineering usually suffers from the small,\ngeometric parameter space, and achieving soliton microcombs is challenging and\nusually requires complicated experimental techniques and setups. In recent\nyears, the invention of photonic-crystal resonators (PhCRs) provides access to\nsolitons in a convenient and stable way while its mechanism has not been fully\nunderstood. In this article, we highlight the perspectives of generating\nsolitons for various applications in PhCRs and give a thorough understanding of\nthe dynamics of soliton formation. We also propose a nanocomposite waveguide\nstructure for the optimization of group velocity dispersion (GVD), lifting the\nlimitation on geometric parameter space. We apply it to the design of the\npump-harmonic microcomb, a new concept for f-2f self-referencing in microcombs.\nInspired by the pulse-driven microresonator, we provide a scheme of\ntwo-microresonator network, retaining the convenience of using a continuous\nwave laser for microcomb generation.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of efficiently organizing search over very large\ntrees, which arises in many applications ranging from autonomous driving to\naerial vehicles. Here, we are motivated by off-road autonomy, where real-time\nplanning is essential. Classical approaches use graphs of motion primitives and\nexploit dominance to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and prune expansions\nefficiently. However, for complex dynamics, repeatedly solving two-point\nboundary-value problems makes graph construction too slow for fast kinodynamic\nplanning. Hybrid A* (HA*) addressed this challenge by searching over a tree of\nmotion primitives and introducing approximate pruning using a grid-based\ndominance check. However, choosing the grid resolution is difficult: too coarse\nrisks failure, while too fine leads to excessive expansions and slow planning.\nWe propose Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*), an anytime tree-search\nframework that dynamically organizes vertex expansions without rigid pruning.\nIGHA* provably matches or outperforms HA*. For both on-road kinematic and\noff-road kinodynamic planning queries for a car-like robot, variants of IGHA*\nuse 6x fewer expansions to the best solution compared to an optimized version\nof HA*. In simulated off-road experiments in a high fidelity simulator, IGHA*\noutperforms HA*M when both are used in the loop with a model predictive\ncontroller. We demonstrate real-time performance both in simulation and on a\nsmall-scale off-road vehicle, enabling fast, robust planning under complex\ndynamics.

This is challenging because\napplying the electronic structure method of choice - coupled cluster theory\nwith single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] - to\ncondensed phase systems is currently limited by its computational cost and\ncomplexity. Recent tour-de-force efforts have demonstrated that this accuracy\ncan indeed bring simulated liquid water into close agreement with experiment\nusing machine learning potentials (MLPs). However, achieving this remains far\nfrom routine, requiring large datasets and significant computational cost. In\nthis work, we introduce a practical approach that combines developments in MLPs\nwith local correlation approximations to enable routine CCSD(T)-level\nsimulations of liquid water. When combined with nuclear quantum effects, we\nachieve agreement to experiments for structural and transport properties.\nCrucially, this approach extends beyond constant volume to constant pressure\nsimulations, allowing fundamental properties such as the density to now be\npredicted by MLP-based CCSD(T) models. Importantly, the approach also handles\nconstant pressure simulations, enabling MLP-based CCSD(T) models to predict\nisothermal-isobaric bulk properties, such as water's density maximum in close\nagreement with experiment. Encompassing tests across electronic structure,\ndatasets and MLP architecture, this work provides a practical blueprint towards\nroutinely developing CCSD(T)-based MLPs for the condensed phase.",

The most\npromising candidates are distinguished based on the variance of the individual\ncation energies, which we introduce as our entropy descriptor, and the enthalpy\nof mixing, which is used as the enthalpy descriptor. The approach is applied to\ntetravalent HEOs, and its validity is confirmed by comparison to alternative\ndescriptors and DFT calculations for a set of 7 elements. The search is then\nextended to a set of 14 elements and three crystal structures, where it\nsuccessfully identifies the only known stable 4-component HEO in the\n$\\alpha$-PbO$_2$ structure, as well as predicting several new 5-component\ncandidate systems.

Treating the particle and its environment as an\nentangled system, unmodified quantum mechanics shows remarkable success toward\nthis end. This is the purview of decoherence theory. How we then think about\nmacroscopic reality becomes dependent on how we think about microscopic\nreality. Is quantum mechanics successful because it describes what microscopic\nparticles are really doing, such as traveling both interferometer paths at the\nsame time? Or is the wavefunction only a mathematical tool which predicts\nmeasurement outcomes but does not describe microscopic reality? Both options\nare uncomfortable.

We\nperform spherical convolutions at a range of scales on dark matter halo\nsimulations to measure the scale-dependent correlations in the density field.\nFrom these, we compute the first three moments and compare them to a model\nexpectation vector, parameterized to the second power in $f_{\\mathrm{NL}}$. Our\nmethod provides about 21% improvement in sensitivity to $f_{\\mathrm{NL}}$ with\nrespect to using the two point correlation function alone. Notably, we find\nthat the second moment alone carries nearly as much constraining power as the\nmean, highlighting the potential of higher-order statistics. Given its\nsimplicity and efficiency, this framework is well-suited for application to\ncurrent and upcoming large-scale surveys such as DESI.",

As a first application, we deduce the finiteness of\n$S$-integral points on log-general type varieties, thereby obtaining a\nhigher-dimensional analogue of Siegel's theorem and new evidence toward Vojta's\nconjectures. Beyond these arithmetic applications, our methods bring together\ntools from Arakelov geometry, Diophantine approximation, and the theory of\ndeterminants of auxiliary sections.

One such censorship practice, withholding content in a\nparticular state has renewed attention due to Elon Musk's apparent willingness\nto comply with state demands. In this study, we present the first quantitative\nanalysis of the impact of state censorship by withholding on social media using\na dataset in which two prominent patterns emerged: Russian accounts censored in\nthe EU for spreading state-sponsored narratives, and Turkish accounts blocked\nwithin Turkey for promoting militant propaganda. We find that censorship has\nlittle impact on posting frequency but significantly reduces likes and retweets\nby 25%, and follower growth by 90%-especially when the censored region aligns\nwith the account's primary audience. Meanwhile, some Russian accounts continue\nto experience growth as their audience is outside the withholding\njurisdictions. We develop a user-level binary classifier with a transformer\nbackbone and temporal aggregation strategies, aiming to predict whether an\naccount is likely to be withheld. Through an ablation study, we find that tweet\ncontent is the primary signal in predicting censorship, while tweet metadata\nand profile features contribute marginally.

    "abstract": "Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even\na small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current\nstate-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,\nproducing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and\nhallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack\nthe flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for\nmodern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot\ntranslation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for\nneural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To\naddress this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework\nthat treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic\ncomponents rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated\nneural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,\nmulti-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical\ndecomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from\nboth successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL\nspecifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds\na causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six\nstandard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared\nto LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This\nwork shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural\nnetworks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to\neach other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for\nbuilding autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical\nreal-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Conventional research on educational effects typically either employs a\n\"years of schooling\" measure of education, or dichotomizes attainment as a\npoint-in-time treatment. Yet, such a conceptualization of education is\nmisaligned with the sequential process by which individuals make educational\ntransitions. In this paper, I propose a causal mediation framework for the\nstudy of educational effects on outcomes such as earnings. The framework\nconsiders the effect of a given educational transition as operating indirectly,\nvia progression through subsequent transitions, as well as directly, net of\nthese transitions. I demonstrate that the average treatment effect (ATE) of\neducation can be additively decomposed into mutually exclusive components that\ncapture these direct and indirect effects. The decomposition has several\nspecial properties which distinguish it from conventional mediation\ndecompositions of the ATE, properties which facilitate less restrictive\nidentification assumptions as well as identification of all causal paths in the\ndecomposition. An analysis of the returns to high school completion in the\nNLSY97 cohort suggests that the payoff to a high school degree stems\noverwhelmingly from its direct labor market returns. Mediation via college\nattendance, completion and graduate school attendance is small because of\nindividuals' low counterfactual progression rates through these subsequent\ntransitions.",

One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is\nidiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be\nunderstood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.\nIn this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect\nidiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We\nevaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1\ndistillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four\nidiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller\nand more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought\n(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but\nnot to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)\nshow modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models\ndemonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate\ndefinitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the\nactual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions\nin the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some\ncases.",

ITS\narchitectures aim to tolerate intrusions, ensuring system compromise is\nprevented or mitigated even with adversary presence. Existing ITS solutions\noften employ Risk Managers leveraging public security intelligence to adjust\nsystem defenses dynamically against emerging threats. However, these approaches\nrely heavily on databases like NVD and ExploitDB, which require manual analysis\nfor newly discovered vulnerabilities. This dependency limits the system's\nresponsiveness to rapidly evolving threats. HAL 9000, an ITS Risk Manager\nintroduced in our prior work, addressed these challenges through machine\nlearning. By analyzing descriptions of known vulnerabilities, HAL 9000 predicts\nand assesses new vulnerabilities automatically. To calculate the risk of a\nsystem, it also incorporates the Exploitability Probability Scoring system to\nestimate the likelihood of exploitation within 30 days, enhancing proactive\ndefense capabilities.\n  Despite its success, HAL 9000's reliance on NVD and ExploitDB knowledge is a\nlimitation, considering the availability of other sources of information. This\nextended work introduces a custom-built scraper that continuously mines diverse\nthreat sources, including security advisories, research forums, and real-time\nexploit proofs-of-concept. This significantly expands HAL 9000's intelligence\nbase, enabling earlier detection and assessment of unverified vulnerabilities.\nOur evaluation demonstrates that integrating scraper-derived intelligence with\nHAL 9000's risk management framework substantially improves its ability to\naddress emerging threats.

Often these models are purely deterministic, producing a single\nsimulation for each set of initial conditions. If observed realizations\ndemonstrate between-realization variability for important aspects of the\nphenomenon, those aspects can be simulated by adding probabilistic components\nto the deterministic models to create random trajectory (RT) models.\n  The RT model framework provides probabilistic models which can be fit to data\nand validated, together with a clear perspective on how difficult it can be to\nestablish any kind of validity for a fitted model. It treats models as code\nwith adjustable coefficients, rather than as systems of differential equations.\nIt provides a simply stated necessary condition for these code models to be\neasily fit and verified, as well as an argument that this condition can almost\nnever be checked. When the necessary condition cannot be checked, the RT model\nframework identifies the code models as black box models which may have the\ncapacity for emulating the joint distributions of small collections of\nstatistics observed on realizations, but which can only provide very weak\nevidence for any form of explanation for the emergence of any aspect of the\nphenomenon.

    "abstract": "Infectious disease spread is a multi-scale process composed of within-host\n(biological) and between-host (social) drivers and disentangling them from each\nother is a central challenge in epidemiology. Here, we introduce VIBES, a\nmulti-scale modeling framework that explicitly integrates viral dynamics based\non patient-level data with population-level transmission on a data-driven\nnetwork of social contacts. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study, we analyze three\nemergent epidemic properties, namely the generation time, serial interval, and\npre-symptomatic transmission. First, we established a purely biological\nbaseline, thus independent of the reproduction number (R), from the within-host\nmodel, estimating a generation time of 6.3 days for symptomatic individuals and\n43.1% presymptomatic transmission. Then, using the full model incorporating\nsocial contacts, we found a shorter generation time (5.4 days at R=3.0) and an\nincrease in pre-symptomatic transmission (52.8% at R=3.0), disentangling the\nimpact of social drivers from a purely biological baseline. We further show\nthat as pathogen transmissibility increases (R from 1.3 to 6), competition\namong infectious individuals shortens the generation time and serial interval\nby up to 21% and 13%, respectively. Conversely, a social intervention, like\nisolation, increases the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission by about\n30%. Our framework also estimates metrics that are challenging to obtain\nempirically, such as the generation time for asymptomatic individuals (5.6\ndays; 95%CI: 5.1-6.0 at R=1.3). Our findings establish multi-scale modeling as\na powerful tool for mechanistically quantifying how pathogen biology and human\nsocial behavior shape epidemic dynamics as well as for assessing public health\ninterventions.",

As JWST's primary spectroscopic instrument for faint, distant\ntargets, NIRSpec plays a central role in several of the mission's core science\ngoals. Its signature multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode enables the\nsimultaneous acquisition of spectra for up to a hundred targets across the\nfield of view, using a micro-shutter array (MSA) comprised of nearly 250,000\nindividually addressable micro-electromechanical shutters.\n  The MSA is susceptible to occasional electrical shorts, which produce\nunwanted infrared glow in MOS exposures, rendering them unusable and wasting\nvaluable observatory time. Mitigation requires promptly identifying the\naffected shutter(s) and masking the corresponding row(s) or column(s) to\nprevent future activation. However, masking shutters unnecessarily reduces\nNIRSpec's multiplexing capacity, so it is important to minimize the extent of\nmasking while reliably suppressing the short's effects.\n  More than two years of operations have informed refinements in technical\nprocedures and operational decision-making around short mitigation. This\nexperience also supports new efforts to identify and unmask previously affected\nrows or columns where shorts have since disappeared, enabling the recovery of\nmultiplexing capacity that would otherwise remain lost.\n  As MSA technology matures toward use in future missions such as the Habitable\nWorlds Observatory, operational strategies developed for NIRSpec remain\nrelevant beyond JWST. This paper provides an overview of MSA shorts mitigation\noperations, summarizes shorts observed since the completion of commissioning,\nand describes the evolving contingency procedures that have enabled continued\nscience productivity from this unique payload.",

    "abstract": "The problem of CSP sparsification asks: for a given CSP instance, what is the\nsparsest possible reweighting such that for every possible assignment to the\ninstance, the number of satisfied constraints is preserved up to a factor of $1\n\\pm \\epsilon$? We initiate the study of the sparsification of random CSPs. In\nparticular, we consider two natural random models: the $r$-partite model and\nthe uniform model. In the $r$-partite model, CSPs are formed by partitioning\nthe variables into $r$ parts, with constraints selected by randomly picking one\nvertex out of each part. In the uniform model, $r$ distinct vertices are chosen\nat random from the pool of variables to form each constraint.\n  In the $r$-partite model, we exhibit a sharp threshold phenomenon. For every\npredicate $P$, there is an integer $k$ such that a random instance on $n$\nvertices and $m$ edges cannot (essentially) be sparsified if $m \\le n^k$ and\ncan be sparsified to size $\\approx n^k$ if $m \\ge n^k$. Here, $k$ corresponds\nto the largest copy of the AND which can be found within $P$. Furthermore,\nthese sparsifiers are simple, as they can be constructed by i.i.d. sampling of\nthe edges.\n  In the uniform model, the situation is a bit more complex. For every\npredicate $P$, there is an integer $k$ such that a random instance on $n$\nvertices and $m$ edges cannot (essentially) be sparsified if $m \\le n^k$ and\ncan sparsified to size $\\approx n^k$ if $m \\ge n^{k+1}$. However, for some\npredicates $P$, if $m \\in [n^k, n^{k+1}]$, there may or may not be a nontrivial\nsparsifier. In fact, we show that there are predicates where the\nsparsifiability of random instances is non-monotone, i.e., as we add more\nrandom constraints, the instances become more sparsifiable. We give a precise\n(efficiently computable) procedure for determining which situation a specific\npredicate $P$ falls into.",

The proposed algorithms provide exceptional\ncomputational efficiency, adaptive time horizon lengths, and early optimization\ntermination criteria. The use of Kalman smoothers as the backend optimization\nframework provides for a straightforward implementation supported by strong\ntheoretical guarantees. Additionally, a formulation is presented that separates\nlinear model predictive control into purely reactive and anticipatory\ncomponents, enabling any-time any-horizon observed control while ensuring\ncontroller stability for short time horizons. Finally, numerical case studies\nconfirm that nonlinear filter extensions, i.e., the extended Kalman filter and\nunscented Kalman filter, effectively extend observed control to nonlinear\nsystems and objectives.",

When an airfoil or hydrofoil, for\nexample, undergoes time-dependent motion, nonlinear flow phenomena such as\ndynamic stall can emerge. The present work experimentally investigates the\ninteraction between a hydrofoil and surface gravity waves. The waves impose\nperiodic fluctuations of the velocity magnitude and orientation, causing a\nsteadily translating hydrofoil to be susceptible to dynamic stall at large wave\nforcing amplitudes. Simultaneous measurement of both the forces acting on the\nhydrofoil and the flow around it by means of particle image velocimetry (PIV)\nare performed, to properly characterise the hydrofoil-wave interaction. In an\nattempt at alleviating the impact of the flow unsteadiness via passive flow\ncontrol, a bio-inspired tubercle geometry is applied along the hydrofoil\nleading edge. This geometry is known to delay stall in steady cases but has\nscarcely been studied in unsteady flow conditions. The vortex structures\nassociated with dynamic stall are identified, and their trajectories,\ndimension, and strength characterised. This analysis is performed for both\nstraight- and tubercled-leading-edge geometries, with tubercles found to\nqualitatively modify the flow behaviour during dynamic stall. Contrary to\nprevious studies, direct measurements of lift do not evidence any strong\nmodification by tubercles. Drag-driven horizontal force fluctuations, however,\nwhich have not previously been measured in this context, are found to be\nstrongly attenuated. This decrease is quantified, and a physical model based on\nthe flow observations is finally proposed.",

Such systems typically have a total number $W$ of admissible\nmicroscopic configurations which grows with $N$ as $W(N) \\sim \\mu^N\\;(\\mu >1,\n\\, N\\to\\infty)$. Their thermostatistical properties are known to be\nsatisfactorily handled within Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics. In\ncontrast, a system is complex if one or more associated correlations are\nlong-ranged. The simplest examples of such systems are those for which $W(N)\n\\sim N^\\rho\\;\\;(\\rho>0)$. A generalized statistical mechanics grounded on the\nnonadditive entropic functional $S_q(\\{p_{i}\\})=k\\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \\ln_q\n\\frac{1}{p_i} \\;\\;(q\\in \\mathbb{R}, \\;S_1=S_{BG})$ with $\\ln_q z\n=\\frac{z^{1-q}-1}{1-q}$ ($\\ln_1 z=\\ln z$) satisfactorily handles such systems.\nIndeed, for equiprobabilities, $S_{q=1-1/\\rho}(\\{1/W(N)\\})=k\\ln_{1-1/\\rho} W(N)\n\\propto N$. Furthermore, for complex systems, the size of the corresponding\nphase spaces can be related to the property $\\ln_q (x\\otimes_q y) =\\ln_q x +\n\\ln_q y$, $x,y\\geq1$, $q\\leq 1$, where $x\\otimes_q\ny=[x^{1-q}+y^{1-q}-1]^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}_{+}\\;\\;(x\\otimes_1 y=xy)$, and the\n$q$-product $\\otimes_q$ grounds the definition of a $q$-generalized algebra.\nAnother class of complex systems corresponds to $W(N) \\sim\n\\nu^{N^\\gamma}\\;\\;(\\nu >1, \\,\\gamma > 0)$, which appears to be the case of\nblack holes and other cosmological phenomena. This class can be handled with\n$S_\\delta(\\{p_{i}\\}) = k\\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \\Bigl(\\ln \\frac{1}{p_i} \\Bigr)^\\delta\n\\;\\;(\\delta>0)$. Finally, we can define $S_{q,\\delta}(\\{p_{i}\\})=k\\sum_{i=1}^W\np_i \\Bigl(\\ln_q \\frac{1}{p_i} \\Bigr)^\\delta$ $(q\\in\\mathbb{R},\\delta>0)$, which\nunifies all the above ones. In this paper, we generalize the $q$-algebra to a\nnew, promising one, namely the $(q,\\delta)$-algebra.",

First, we present an extensive literature\nreview of experimental, theoretical, and simulation-based approaches for\nmeasuring and predicting CO2 solubility across a wide range of conditions and\nalso a discussion of how the different parameters affect solubility. Second, we\nintroduce an improved set of temperature-dependent Pitzer interaction\nparameters, yielding up to a 76% reduction in average absolute deviation\ncompared to conventional values in the geochemical simulation software PHREEQC.\nThird, we develop a physics-informed machine learning model that integrates\nthermodynamic intuition with data-driven learning, achieving a 14% reduction in\nprediction error over the state-of-the-art and up to 40% improvement at high\nsalinities.

We assess the measurability of a $\\tau - $DM$_{\\rm host}$ relation\nthrough simulated observations of FRBs within the ASKAP/CRAFT survey, taking\ninto account instrumental effects. We show that even when the FRB hosts\nintrinsically follow the $\\tau - $DM relation measured for pulsars, this\ncorrelation cannot be inferred from FRB observations; this limitation arises\nmostly from the large variance around the average cosmic DM value given by the\nMacquart relation, the variance within the $\\tau - $DM relation itself, and\nobservational biases against large $\\tau$ values. We argue that theoretical\nrelations have little utility as priors on redshift, e.g., for purposes of\ngalaxy identification, and that the recent lack of an observed correlation\nbetween scattering and DM in the ASKAP/CRAFT survey is not unexpected, even if\nour understanding of a $\\tau - $DM$_{\\rm host}$ relation is correct.",

We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable\ndistance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint\nset is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we\npropose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that\npenalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.\nFor case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is\nnumerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This\napproach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex\nconstraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to\nconstrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show\nthat a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow\nbut with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is\nmore computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained\ngeneration, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve\nsignificant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target\ndistributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show\nhow our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,\nusing queries to a hard-label black-box classifier.

    "abstract": "As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,\nintegrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for\nimproving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and\ncontrol. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars\nyet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the\nmost critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a\ndedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the\nart in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,\nvision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and\nmethodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the\nChallenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held\nat the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,\nHawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new\nalgorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly\ndetection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,\nand related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the\nWinter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop\nwill feature a mix of academic and industry participation.",

    "abstract": "Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in\nwhite-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded\nexamples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have\na few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial\nexamples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained\nattacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this\npaper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that\ngenerates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by\nstrategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a\nmulti-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial\nexamples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and\npropagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this\nprocess by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,\nenabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base\nattack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models\nacross CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on\nLp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nperceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates\n(e.g., 20.63\\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,\nLPIPS, and FID (improvements $\\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).\nFurthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical\nand strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted\nadaptive attacks for each new defense.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in\nautonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,\nreasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural\nlanguage instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant\ncomputational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view\nimages, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.\nThis overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during\nencoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the\nquadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose\nPrune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs\nin autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a\ndiversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,\nwhich prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than\nrelying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller\nthat learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their\nimportance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does\nnot require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible\nwith modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two\nlarge-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that\nPrune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining\nor improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,\nour method achieves a 6.40$\\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes\n13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM\nbenchmark.",

Methods: Unlike\nexisting approaches that rely on auto-differentiation or that are restricted to\nspecific projector types, our method is based on a general analytical gradient\nformulation for forward/backprojection in the continuous domain. A key insight\nis that the gradients of both forward and back-projection can be expressed\ndirectly in terms of the forward and back-projection operations themselves,\nproviding a unified gradient computation scheme across different projector\ntypes.

Results: Simulation studies illustrate the numerical accuracy\nand computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Experiments\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of this approach for multiple X-ray imaging\ntasks we conducted. In 2D/3D registration, the proposed method achieves ~8x\nspeedup over an existing differentiable forward projector while maintaining\ncomparable accuracy. In motion-compensated analytical reconstruction and\ncone-beam CT geometry calibration, the proposed method enhances image sharpness\nand structural fidelity on real phantom data while showing significant\nefficiency advantages over existing gradient-free and gradient-based solutions.\nConclusion: The proposed differentiable projectors enable effective and\nefficient gradient-based solutions for X-ray imaging tasks requiring rigid\nmotion estimation.",

    "abstract": "The regularity of ecosystem size spectra is one of the most intriguing and\nrelevant phenomena on our planet. Aquatic size spectra generally show a\nlog-linearly downtrending shape, following a power-law distribution. A constant\nlog-linear slope has been reported for many marine pelagic ecosystems, often\nbeing approximately b = -1. Conversely, there are variable\ntrophic-level-biomass relationships (trophic pyramids). The contrasting\nobservations of a constant biomass (M) spectrum slope and highly variable\nbiomass pyramids may be defined as the constant size spectra-variable trophic\ndynamics paradox. Here, a 'mass-specific predator-prey-efficiency theory of\nsize spectra' (PETS) is presented and discussed. A thorough analysis of\navailable data, literature and models result in the conclusion that most\npelagic marine ecosystems are controlled by trophic processes such as\nresource-limit stress (bottom-up control) and top-down regulation, with a key\nrole of the maximum carrying capacity of large-sized organisms. This has\nrelevant consequences for the prediction and interpretation of size spectra and\nthe context of fisheries, whaling, and the introduction of exotic predators\n(e.g., lionfish). The complete size spectrum obtained in situ, including living\norganisms and non-living particles (e.g., for data from LOPC and UVP) is\ndiscussed.

While this poroelastic flow has\ntraditionally been explored in networks where the mesh size is comparable to\nthe solvent molecule size, the effect of network architecture on permeability\nremains underexplored. Here we investigate solvent transport in linear polymer\nnetworks (LPN) and highly elastic bottlebrush elastomer networks (BBN), where\nthe presence of densely grafted sidechains allows for control over swelling and\nmechanical properties. By synthesizing BBNs with systematically varied\ncrosslinking density while maintaining constant sidechain length and grafting\ndensity, we probe the poroelastic response in the stretched backbone regime\n(SBB). Poroelastic relaxation indentation experiments, performed in toluene,\nreveal how permeability scales with crosslink density and polymer volume\nfraction. Compared to LPN with identical chemistry, the BBN exhibited a lower\npermeability scaling exponent with polymer volume fraction that closely matches\nthe theoretical exponent. Despite architectural differences, permeability data\nfor both networks collapse onto a single curve when plotted against dry shear\nmodulus. Our findings demonstrate that molecular network architecture\nsignificantly influences permeability, offering new routes to tailor solvent\ntransport in soft, swollen networks. These insights highlight BBNs as a\npromising platform for applications in permeable membranes, filtration, and\nmicrofluidic systems, and pave the way for further studies on how network\nparameters, such as sidechain length, impact permeability in these highly\ntunable materials.",

From object-centric event logs,\nobject-centric Petri nets (OCPN) can be discovered to replay the behavior of\nprocesses accessing different object types. Although they indicate how objects\nflow through the process and co-occur in events, OCPNs remain underspecified\nabout the relationships of objects. Hence, they are not able to represent\nsynchronization, i.e. executing objects only according to their intended\nrelationships, and fail to identify violating executions. Existing formal\nmodeling approaches, such as object-centric Petri nets with identifiers (OPID),\nrepresent object identities and relationships to synchronize them correctly.\nHowever, OPID discovery has not yet been studied. This paper uses explicit data\nmodels to bridge the gap between OCPNs and formal OPIDs. We identify the\nimplicit assumptions of stable many-to-one relationships in object-centric\nevent logs, which implies synchronization of related objects. To formally\nunderpin this observation, we combine OCPNs with explicit stable many-to-one\nrelationships in a rigorous mapping from OCPNs to OPIDs explicitly capturing\nthe intended stable relationships and the synchronization of related objects.\nWe prove that the original OCPNs and the resulting OPIDs coincide for those\nexecutions that satisfy the intended relationships.

    "abstract": "Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision\nmakers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes\napplication domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However,\nexisting systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:\ndecisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not\nnecessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our\nwork aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching\n(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative\napproach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task\nlike existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most\nconfident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,\ncomatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the\nhuman decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale\nhuman subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.\nThe results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch\noutperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic\nmatching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an\nimplementation of our system are available as open source at\nhttps://github.com/Networks-Learning/human-AI-complementarity-matching.",

    "abstract": "The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity\nRecognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across\nreal-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this\nissue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal\nTransformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used\nin HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially\nresulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the\nactivity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize\nPhysically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation.\nPPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose\nestimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics\nsimulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and\nhardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional\nSTDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,\nwe evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to\ntheir STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can\nreduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects\nused for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving\nmacro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive\nperformance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first\nsystematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the\nadvantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the\npotential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement\nUnit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and\nscalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in\nHAR.",

We validated it on a\nrepresentative sample of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data corresponding to\n1 000 sources from the SMILE project. VIPCALs successfully calibrated\nobservations of 955 of the test sources across multiple frequency bands.

The median ratio of calibrated\nvisibilities to initial total visibilities was 0.87. The average processing\ntime was below 10 minutes per dataset, demonstrating both efficiency and\nscalability.

Simulating the defect's optical response and optically\ndetected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast is key to identifying suitable\ncandidates. However, existing simulation methods are typically unable to supply\nthe required accuracy. Here, we propose two quantum algorithms to detect an\nimbalance in the triplet-to-singlet intersystem crossing (ISC) rates between\nexcited states with the same and different spin projections -- a necessary\ncondition for nonzero ODMR response. The lowest-cost approach evaluates whether\nthe evolution of an $S=0$ state under the spin-orbit coupling induces ISC to\n$S=1$, and also whether there is an imbalance in its intensity depending on the\nfinal state spin projection. The second approach works by comparing the\nemission spectrum of a spin defect with and without the spin-orbit coupling\noperator, inferring ISC intensity for different spin transition channels from\nspectrum intensity changes. Additionally, we present an improved scheme to\nevaluate the defect's optical response, building upon previous work. We study\nthese quantum algorithms in the context of the negatively charged boron vacancy\nin hexagonal boron nitride. We generate an embedded active space of 18 spatial\norbitals using quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) and show that the ISC\nrate imbalance can be detected with as few as 105 logical qubits and $2.2\n\\times 10^8$ Toffoli gates.

The\nblack mirror hypothesis provides a CPT-symmetric alternative to the classical\ndescription of black hole, offering a novel solution to these long-standing\nissues. We show that classical black holes can, in principle, be distinguished\nfrom black mirrors observationally, by using gravitational waves. The principal\nchallenge is to identify a unique, testable signature of the black mirror's\nreflective horizon that can be detected by current or future observatories. The\nhorizon singularity of the black mirror model necessitates that no energy flux\nis propagated beyond the horizon, which can be described effectively by\nimposing specific boundary conditions at the event horizon. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that the quasi-normal mode spectrum of the black mirror is\nfundamentally different from that of classical black holes, as purely ingoing\nmodes are forbidden. Moreover, we show that the reflectivity of the black\nmirror does not depend on any free parameter; it is given precisely by the\nBoltzmann factor, which is independent of the dissipation parameter, indicating\na universal behaviour regardless of the specific underlying quantum dynamics at\nthe horizon. A definitive detection of the predicted gravitational wave echoes\nwould provide compelling evidence distinguishing the reflective boundary of a\nblack mirror from the perfectly absorbing horizon of a classical black hole.\nExtreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are ideal probes for this test, as their\nlong-duration signals allow for the secular accumulation of these faint echoes,\noffering a concrete pathway to challenge the classical paradigm and\nrevolutionise our understanding of spacetime.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new terrestrial planet formation theory demonstrating\nthat Earth-mass planets form naturally in tandem protosolar disks. Our model\nbuilds upon tandem planet formation theory (Ebisuzaki and Imaeda 2017; Imaeda\nand Ebisuzaki 2017a,b, 2018), incorporating magneto-rotational instability\n(MRI) suppression (Balbus and Hawley 1991; Hawley and Balbus 1991), porous\nparticle aggregation (Okuzumi et al. 2012; Kataoka et al. 2013), and standard\nplanet formation mechanisms (e.g., Safronov 1969; Hayashi et al. 1985). In a\ntandem proto-solar disk, planets form at two distinct locations: the inner and\nouter edges of the MRI-suppressed region, where solid particles accumulate. The\ninner edge produces rocky planets, while the outer edge forms gas giants. When\nplanetesimals reach Earth-sized mass at the inner MRI edge, they migrate\noutward due to gas disk torque. For a protosolar disk accretion rate of M_dot =\n10^-7.08 solar masses per year (Case D), the total solid mass at the inner MRI\nedge reaches 1.99 Earth masses, producing two Earth-mass planets. This result\nclosely matches the solar system's terrestrial planet distribution (Earth and\nVenus), which comprises 92% of total terrestrial planet mass, providing strong\nsupport for our formation mechanism.",

In this scenario, a stellar-mass BH\nbinary undergoes isolated binary evolution and merges while hosting a distant,\ndynamically unimportant tertiary stellar companion. The tertiary becomes\nrelevant only after the merger, when the remnant BH receives a GW recoil kick.\nDepending on the kick velocity and system configuration, the outcome can be:\n(i) a bright electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the GW merger; (ii) an LMXB;\n(iii) a wide BH-stellar companion resembling the Gaia BH population; or (iv) an\nunbound, isolated BH. Modeling the three-body dynamics, we find that $\\sim\n0.02\\%$ of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) mergers may be followed by an EM counterpart\nwithin $\\sim$10 days, produced by tidal disruption of the star by the BH.

    "abstract": "Superconductivity in a single two-dimensional Dirac cone offers a natural\nroute to topological superconductivity. While usually considered extrinsic --\narising from proximity to a conventional superconductor -- we investigate when\na doped Dirac cone can spontaneously develop superconductivity from a\nshort-range repulsive interaction $U$ via the Kohn--Luttinger mechanism. We\nshow that an ideal, linear Dirac cone is immune to pairing at leading order in\n$U^2$. Superconductivity instead emerges only through higher-order in $k$\ncorrections to the dispersion, which are unavoidable in any lattice realization\nand crucially dictate the pairing symmetry. The form of the pairing thus\nreflects how the well-known obstruction to realizing a single Dirac cone on a\nlattice is circumvented. When a Dirac cone arises from broken time-reversal\nsymmetry -- for instance, at a transition between Chern insulators or in a\nvalley-polarized phase -- we find a topological $p - ip$ state whose chirality\nis opposite to that of the parent chiral metal above $T_c$. By contrast, for a\nsurface Dirac cone of a 3D topological insulator, superconductivity is\nstabilized by anisotropies in the dispersion. For $C_{3v}$-symmetric warping,\nas in $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{Te}_{3}$, pairing is strongest when the Fermi\nsurface becomes hexagonal, leading to order in the $(d \\pm id)\\times(p+ip)$\nchannel with accidental near-nodes. In the highly anisotropic limit $v_x \\gg\nv_y$, relevant to side surfaces of layered materials, the Fermi surface splits\ninto two branches, and nesting favors a pairing symmetry $\\Delta \\sim\n\\mathrm{sgn}(k_x)\\cos(k_y)$ reminiscent of organic superconductors.",

Here, we present\nSN 2021qvo: a SN Ia that exhibits a clear early bump in photometry obtained by\nthe Young Supernova Experiment. Photometric and spectroscopic observations of\nSN 2021qvo show that it has a broader light curve, higher peak luminosity,\nshallower Si II $\\lambda$5972 pseudo-equivalent width, and lower ejecta\nvelocities than normal SNe Ia, which are all consistent with the\ncharacteristics of the 2003fg-like (often called \"super-Chandrasekhar\") SN\nsubtype. Including SN 2021qvo, just four known 2003fg-like SNe Ia have\nsufficient pre-peak data to reveal a rising light-curve bump, and all four have\nbump detections. Host-galaxy analysis reveals that SN 2021qvo exploded in a\nlow-mass galaxy ${\\rm log}(M_{\\ast}/M_{\\odot}) = 7.83^{+0.17}_{-0.24}$, also\nconsistent with other members of this class. We investigate the validity of the\nleading early-bump 2003fg-like SN Ia progenitor model, an interaction between\nthe circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta, by modeling the early bump\nand subsequent light-curve evolution of SN 2021qvo with the Modular Open Source\nFitter for Transients. We find that the bump can be modeled with a best-fit CSM\nmass of $\\log_{10}(M_\\mathrm{CSM}/M_{\\odot}) = -2.33^{+0.26}_{-0.15}$. SN\n2021qvo adds to the small but growing number of 2003fg-like SNe Ia with rising\nlight-curve bumps; as the number of these SNe Ia with CSM estimates continues\nto grow, population-level inferences about the CSM distribution will be able to\nconstrain the progenitor scenario for these SNe Ia.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing complete and interactive 3D scenes remains a fundamental\nchallenge in computer vision and robotics, particularly due to persistent\nobject occlusions and limited sensor coverage. Multiview observations from a\nsingle scene scan often fail to capture the full structural details. Existing\napproaches typically rely on multi stage pipelines, such as segmentation,\nbackground completion, and inpainting or require per-object dense scanning,\nboth of which are error-prone, and not easily scalable. We propose IGFuse, a\nnovel framework that reconstructs interactive Gaussian scene by fusing\nobservations from multiple scans, where natural object rearrangement between\ncaptures reveal previously occluded regions. Our method constructs segmentation\naware Gaussian fields and enforces bi-directional photometric and semantic\nconsistency across scans. To handle spatial misalignments, we introduce a\npseudo-intermediate scene state for unified alignment, alongside collaborative\nco-pruning strategies to refine geometry. IGFuse enables high fidelity\nrendering and object level scene manipulation without dense observations or\ncomplex pipelines. Extensive experiments validate the framework's strong\ngeneralization to novel scene configurations, demonstrating its effectiveness\nfor real world 3D reconstruction and real-to-simulation transfer.

Although existing\ndetection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)\nscenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to\nfeatures used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of\nLLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively\ncapture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between\nLLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this\nhypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural\nactivation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we\npropose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.\nSpecifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of\nLGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better\nidentify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of\nthe text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a\nprecomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms\nall baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD\nscenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and\nmainstream attacks.

Traditional methods, which treat\nnavigation and manipulation as separate tasks, often fail in such\n'manipulate-to-navigate' scenarios, as obstacles must be removed before\nnavigation. In these cases, active interaction with the environment is required\nto clear obstacles while ensuring sufficient space for movement. To address the\nmanipulate-to-navigate problem, we propose a reinforcement learning-based\napproach for learning manipulation actions that facilitate subsequent\nnavigation. Our method combines manipulability priors to focus the robot on\nhigh manipulability body positions with affordance maps for selecting\nhigh-quality manipulation actions. By focusing on feasible and meaningful\nactions, our approach reduces unnecessary exploration and allows the robot to\nlearn manipulation strategies more effectively. We present two new\nmanipulate-to-navigate simulation tasks called Reach and Door with the Boston\nDynamics Spot robot. The first task tests whether the robot can select a good\nhand position in the target area such that the robot base can move effectively\nforward while keeping the end effector position fixed. The second task requires\nthe robot to move a door aside in order to clear the navigation path. Both of\nthese tasks need first manipulation and then navigating the base forward.\nResults show that our method allows a robot to effectively interact with and\ntraverse dynamic environments. Finally, we transfer the learned policy to a\nreal Boston Dynamics Spot robot, which successfully performs the Reach task.",

However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between\ntraining and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the\nstructure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens,\nwhereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random.\nAlthough this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal\nperformance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing\nthis gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the\nproblem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential\ndecision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement\nlearning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to\nexploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model\nunder the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches\nthe performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer\ngradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and\n54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight\nupdates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in\ninference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine\ntokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we\nrefer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains\nwhen combined with MDPO.

Recent studies have revealed that CA is not necessarily only a\nWeyl-node property, but is rather a Fermi surface property, and is also present\nin a more general class of materials, for example, in spin orbit-coupled\nnoncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs). The interplay of strain, CA, and charge\nand thermomagnetic transport in SOC-NCMs, however, remains unexplored. Here we\nresolve this gap. Using a tight-binding model for SOC-NCMs, we first\ndemonstrate that strain in SOC-NCMs induces anisotropy in the spin-orbit\ncoupling and generates an axial electric field. Then, using the quasi-classical\nBoltzmann transport formalism with momentum-dependent intraband and interband\nscattering processes, we show that strain in the presence of external magnetic\nfield can generate temperature gradients via the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect,\nwhose direction and behavior depends the on interplay of multiple factors: the\nangle between the applied strain and magnetic field, the presence of the chiral\nanomaly, the Lorentz force, and the strength of interband scattering. We\nfurther reveal that time-reversal symmetry breaking in the presence of an\nexternal magnetic field generates the Berry-curvature-driven anomalous\nEttingshausen effect, which is qualitatively distinct from the conventional\nLorentz-force-driven counterpart.

The 21-cm signal from EoR is expected to be\nhighly non-Gaussian; therefore, we need to use higher-order statistics, e.g.,\nbispectrum. Moreover, the forward modeling of the signal and its statistics for\na varying set of model parameters requires rerunning the simulations many\ntimes, which is computationally very expensive. To overcome this challenge,\nmany artificial neural network (ANN) based emulators have been introduced,\nwhich produce the 21-cm summaries in a fraction of the time. However, ANN\nemulators have a drawback: they can only produce point-value predictions; thus,\nthey fail to capture the uncertainty associated with their predictions.\nTherefore, when such emulators are used in the Bayesian inference pipeline,\nthey cannot naturally propagate their prediction uncertainties to the estimated\nmodel parameters. To address this problem, we have developed Bayesian neural\nnetwork (BNN) emulators for the 21-cm signal statistics, which provide the\nposterior distribution of the predicted signal statistics, including their\nprediction uncertainty. We use these BNN emulators in our Bayesian inference\npipeline to infer the EoR parameters through 21-cm summaries of the mock\nobservation of 21-cm signal with telescopic noise for $1000$ hr of SKA-LOW\nobservation. We show that BNN emulators can capture the prediction uncertainty\nfor the 21-cm power spectrum and bispectrum, and using these emulators in the\ninference pipeline provides better and tighter constraints on them. We reduced\nthe training dataset and showed that, for smaller training datasets, BNN\noutperforms the ANN emulators. We also show that using the bispectrum as a\nsummary statistic gives better constraints on EoR parameters than the power\nspectrum.",

We introduce two key metrics that show differences in\ncurrent benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models\nfrom worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability\nbetween training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better\nsignal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,\nand those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These\nresults suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful\nbenchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect\nsignal or noise.

We also find that filtering noisy\nsubtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable\nmulti-task evaluations.

    "abstract": "Thinking LLMs solve complex tasks at the expense of increased compute and\noverthinking on simpler problems, while non-thinking LLMs are faster and\ncheaper but underthink on harder reasoning problems. This has led to the\ndevelopment of separate thinking and non-thinking LLM variants, leaving the\nonus of selecting the optimal model for each query on the end user. In this\nwork, we introduce OptimalThinkingBench, a unified benchmark that jointly\nevaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs and also encourages the\ndevelopment of optimally-thinking models that balance performance and\nefficiency. Our benchmark comprises two sub-benchmarks: OverthinkingBench,\nfeaturing simple queries in 72 domains, and UnderthinkingBench, containing 11\nchallenging reasoning tasks. Using novel thinking-adjusted accuracy metrics, we\nperform extensive evaluation of 33 different thinking and non-thinking models\nand show that no model is able to optimally think on our benchmark. Thinking\nmodels often overthink for hundreds of tokens on the simplest user queries\nwithout improving performance. In contrast, large non-thinking models\nunderthink, often falling short of much smaller thinking models. We further\nexplore several methods to encourage optimal thinking, but find that these\napproaches often improve on one sub-benchmark at the expense of the other,\nhighlighting the need for better unified and optimal models in the future.",

While many techniques have\nadvanced retargeting techniques in decades, transfer motions across diverse\ntopologies remains less-explored. The primary obstacle lies in the inherent\ntopological inconsistency between source and target skeletons, which restricts\nthe establishment of straightforward one-to-one bone correspondences. Besides,\nthe current lack of large-scale paired motion datasets spanning different\ntopological structures severely constrains the development of data-driven\napproaches. To address these limitations, we introduce Motion2Motion, a novel,\ntraining-free framework.

Through\ncomprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that\nMotion2Motion achieves efficient and reliable performance in both\nsimilar-skeleton and cross-species skeleton transfer scenarios. The practical\nutility of our approach is further evidenced by its successful integration in\ndownstream applications and user interfaces, highlighting its potential for\nindustrial applications.

The Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation,\nlinking star formation rate (SFR) and gas surface densities, is fundamental to\nunderstand star formation regulation, yet remains poorly constrained at $z > 2$\ndue to observational limitations and uncertainties in locally calibrated gas\ntracers. The [CII] $158 {\\rm \\mu m}$ line has recently emerged as a key probe\nof the cold ISM and star formation in the early Universe. We investigate\nwhether the resolved [CII]-SFR and KS relations established at low redshift\nremain valid at $4 < z < 6$ by analysing 13 main-sequence galaxies from the\nALPINE and CRISTAL surveys, using multi-wavelength data (HST, JWST, ALMA) at\n$\\sim2$ kpc resolution. We perform pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution\n(SED) modelling with CIGALE on resolution-homogenised images. We develop a\nstatistical framework to fit the [CII]-SFR relation that accounts for pixel\ncovariance and compare our results to classical fitting methods. We test two\n[CII]-to-gas conversion prescriptions to assess their impact on inferred gas\nsurface densities and depletion times. We find a resolved [CII]-SFR relation\nwith a slope of $0.87 \\pm 0.15$ and intrinsic scatter of $0.19 \\pm 0.03$ dex,\nwhich is shallower and tighter than previous studies at $z\\sim5$. The resolved\nKS relation is highly sensitive to the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor: using a\nfixed global $\\alpha_{\\rm [CII]}$ yields depletion times of $0.5$-$1$ Gyr,\nwhile a surface brightness-dependent $W_{\\rm [CII]}$, places some galaxies with\nhigh gas density in the starburst regime ($<0.1$ Gyr). Future inputs from both\nsimulations and observations are required to better understand how the\n[CII]-to-gas conversion factor depends on local ISM properties. We need to\nbreak this fundamental limit to properly study the KS relation at $z\\gtrsim4$.",

We\nshow that explicitly including semantic information such as day-of-the-week and\nuser-specific historical information can help the model better understand\nindividual patterns of life and improve predictions. Moreover, since the\nabsence of explicit user information is often missing due to user privacy, we\nshow that the sampling of users may exacerbate data skewness and result in a\nsubstantial loss in predictive accuracy.

    "abstract": "This study demonstrates how wind farm flow physics influence noise generation\nand downstream propagation through numerical simulations. The flow field is\nmodeled using large-eddy simulations (LES), and the time-averaged output serves\nas input to acoustic models that predict wind turbine noise. In the first\nturbine row, turbulence-induced noise (TIN) and trailing edge noise (TEN)\ncontribute equally, with TIN dominating at low frequencies and TEN at higher\nfrequencies. Downstream, TEN decreases due to lower wind speeds, while TIN\nmostly persists due to increased turbulence dissipation. These effects are more\npronounced in aligned wind farms, where stronger wake interactions occur, than\nin staggered layouts. However, staggered farms produce more noise overall\nbecause turbines operate at higher wind speeds.Additionally, wind farm flow\nsignificantly affects sound propagation downwind. The wake superposition\nmodifies sound focusing leading to different amplification area than for an\nisolated turbine. For a staggered layout it particularly shows enhanced sound\nfocusing downwind due to the position of the turbine wakes. This leads to\nhigher sound levels and higher amplitude modulation downwind for the wind farm\ncompared to an aligned layout. These phenomena are not captured by models based\non isolated turbines. These findings underscore the importance of integrating\nflow and acoustic models to more accurately assess the environmental impact of\nwind farms.",

    "abstract": "Extreme weather events epitomize high cost: to society through their physical\nimpacts, and to computer servers that are used to simulate them to provide\ninformation to mitigate those impacts. It costs hundreds of years to sample a\nfew once-per-century events with straightforward model integration, but that\ncost can be much reduced with rare event sampling, which nudges ensembles of\nsimulations to convert moderate events to severe ones, e.g., by steering a\ncyclone directly through a region of interest. With proper statistical\naccounting, rare event algorithms can provide quantitative climate risk\nassessment at reduced cost. But this can only work if ensemble members diverge\nfast enough. Sudden, transient events characteristic of Earth's midlatitude\nstorm track regions, such as heavy precipitation and heat extremes, pose a\nparticular challenge because they come and go faster than an ensemble can\nexplore the possibilities. Here we extend standard rare event algorithms to\nhandle this challenging case in an idealized atmospheric general circulation\nmodel, achieving 5-10 times sped-up estimation of long return periods, such as\n100-150 years from only 20 years of simulation for extremes of daily\nprecipitation and surface temperature. The algorithm, called TEAMS\n(``trying-early adaptive multilevel splitting''), was developed previously in\nFinkel and O'Gorman (2024) using a toy chaotic system, and relies on a key\nparameter -- the advance split time -- which may be estimated based on simple\ndiagnostics of ensemble dispersion rates.

We study whether such\nreasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both perceptual\nand temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning,\ndespite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its\nreliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial\nRepresentations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative\nsampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate\ntemporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex\ntemporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube. In particular, for the\nRubik's Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial\nstates and allow it to solve the puzzle using fewer search steps than BestFS,\nthough with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that\nefficiently solves arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations,\nwithout relying on an external search algorithm.",

By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam\nexposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling\nstrength.

A\ndatabase of DIII-D locked mode disruptions provides two main disruption\ncriteria, which are shown to be signatures of RWTMs. The first is that the q =\n2 rational surface must be sufficiently close the resistive wall surrounding\nthe plasma to interact with it. If active feedback is used, this implies that\nRWTMs can be prevented from causing major disruptions. This is demonstrated in\nsimulations. The second criterion is that the current profile is sufficiently\npeaked. This is caused by edge cooling, such as by impurity radiation and\nturbulence, which suppress edge current and temperature. This implies the\ndisruptions are not caused by neoclassical tearing modes (NTM), because the\nbootstrap current is also suppressed. The dependence of the critical internal\ninductance on elongation is given, which suggests that elongation might be used\nas an actuator to prevent disruptions. At high $\\beta,$ resistive wall modes\n(RWM) can be stabilized with feedback. Feedback also stabilizes high $\\beta$\nRWTMs, as shown in NSTX data and in simulations.

In addition to being truthful, ATB is\nsound, complete, continuous, and quadratically related to two existing\ncalibration measures: the smooth calibration error (smCal) and the (lower)\ndistance to calibration (distCal). The simplicity in our definition of ATB\nmakes it efficient and straightforward to compute. ATB allows faster estimation\nalgorithms with significantly easier implementations than smCal and distCal,\nachieving improved running time and simplicity for the calibration testing\nproblem studied by Hu et al. (2024). We also introduce a general recipe for\nconstructing truthful measures, which proves the truthfulness of ATB as a\nspecial case and allows us to construct other truthful calibration measures\nsuch as quantile-binned l_2-ECE.",

This is accomplished by modeling the\nunderlying function of scientific simulations, removing the need to run\nexpensive simulations. Beyond just mapping from input parameter to output,\nsurrogates have also been shown useful for inverse problems: output to input\nparameters. Inverse problems can be understood as search, where we aim to find\nparameters whose surrogate outputs contain a specified feature. Yet finding\nthese parameters can be costly, especially for high-dimensional parameter\nspaces. Thus, existing surrogate-based solutions primarily focus on finding a\nsmall set of matching parameters, in the process overlooking the broader\npicture of plausible parameters. Our work aims to model and visualize the\ndistribution of possible input parameters that produce a given output feature.\nTo achieve this goal, we aim to address two challenges: (1) the approximation\nerror inherent in the surrogate model and (2) forming the parameter\ndistribution in an interactive manner. We model error via density estimation,\nreporting high density only if a given parameter configuration is close to\ntraining parameters, measured both over the input and output space. Our density\nestimate is used to form a prior belief on parameters, and when combined with a\nlikelihood on features, gives us an efficient way to sample plausible parameter\nconfigurations that generate a target output feature. We demonstrate the\nusability of our solution through a visualization interface by performing\nfeature-driven parameter analysis over the input parameter space of three\nsimulation datasets.

    "abstract": "A novel long-lived distributed problem, called Team Formation (TF), is\nintroduced together with a message- and time-efficient randomized algorithm.\nThe problem is defined over the asynchronous model with a complete\ncommunication graph, using bounded size messages, where a certain fraction of\nthe nodes may experience a generalized, strictly stronger, version of initial\nfailures. The goal of a TF algorithm is to assemble tokens injected by the\nenvironment, in a distributed manner, into teams of size $\\sigma$, where\n$\\sigma$ is a parameter of the problem.\n  The usefulness of TF is demonstrated by using it to derive efficient\nalgorithms for many distributed problems. Specifically, we show that various\n(one-shot as well as long-lived) distributed problems reduce to TF. This\nincludes well-known (and extensively studied) distributed problems such as\nseveral versions of leader election and threshold detection. For example, we\nare the first to break the linear message complexity bound for asynchronous\nimplicit leader election. We also improve the time complexity of\nmessage-optimal algorithms for asynchronous explicit leader election. Other\ndistributed problems that reduce to TF are new ones, including matching players\nin online gaming platforms, a generalization of gathering, constructing a\nperfect matching in an induced subgraph of the complete graph, quorum sensing\nin message-passing networks, and more. To complement our positive contribution,\nwe establish a tight lower bound on the message complexity of TF algorithms.",

    "abstract": "There are well established reductions between combinatorial sampling and\ncounting problems (Jerrum, Valiant, Vazirani TCS 1986). Building off of a very\nrecent parallel algorithm utilizing this connection (Liu, Yin, Zhang arxiv\n2024), we demonstrate the first approximate counting algorithm in the\nCongestedClique for a wide range of problems. Most interestingly, we present an\nalgorithm for approximating the number of $q$-colorings of a graph within\n$\\epsilon$-multiplicative error, when $q>\\alpha\\Delta$ for any constant\n$\\alpha>2$, in $\\Tilde{O}\\big(\\frac{n^{1/3}}{\\epsilon^2}\\big)$ rounds. More\ngenerally, we achieve a runtime of\n$\\Tilde{O}\\big(\\frac{n^{1/3}}{\\epsilon^2}\\big)$ rounds for approximating the\npartition function of Gibbs distributions defined over graphs when simple\nlocality and fast mixing conditions hold. Gibbs distributions are widely used\nin fields such as machine learning and statistical physics. We obtain our\nresult by providing an algorithm to draw $n$ random samples from a distributed\nMarkov chain in parallel, using similar ideas to triangle counting (Dolev,\nLenzen, Peled DISC 2012) and semiring matrix multiplication (Censor-Hillel,\nKaski, Korhonen, Lenzen, Paz, Suomela PODC 2015). Aside from counting problems,\nthis result may be interesting for other applications requiring a large number\nof samples. In the special case of estimating the partition function of the\nhardcore model, also known as counting weighted independent sets, we can do\neven better and achieve an $\\Tilde{O}\\big(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}\\big)$ round\nalgorithm, when the fugacity $\\lambda \\leq \\frac{\\alpha}{\\Delta-1}$, where\n$\\alpha$ is an arbitrary constant less than $1$.",

We therefore investigate the possible molecular content of\nhigh-redshift CGM gas, and its potential detectability via (rest-frame)\nfar-ultraviolet (UV) absorption line studies. For this purpose we develop an\nanalytic sub-grid model for HI-to-H$_2$ transitions and incorporate the model\nwith zoom-in FIRE-2 simulations of evolving high-$z$ galaxies.

Our pipeline combines Low-Rank Adaptation with MaskR$^2$,\na lightweight remapping layer that aligns novel mask formats with the\npretrained model's conditioning channels.

Finally, mixing less than 200 real\nTEE frames with our synthetic echoes improves the dice score on a multiclass\nsegmentation task, particularly boosting performance on underrepresented\nright-heart structures. Our results demonstrate that (1) semantically\ncontrolled TEE images can be generated with low overhead, (2) MaskR$^2$\neffectively transforms unseen mask formats into compatible formats without\ndamaging downstream task performance, and (3) our method generates images that\nare effective for improving performance on a downstream task of multiclass\nsegmentation.",

This survey provides the first\nsystematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic\nmanipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and\ndelineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models,\nencompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of\nintegration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning\nfrom execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this\nfoundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models:\n(1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning,\ntraining-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model\nintegration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating\narchitectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks\nthat support their development; (3) identification of promising directions,\nincluding memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent\ncooperation, and other emerging capabilities.

Bayesian calibration methods offer a principled\nframework for combining prior knowledge with data while rigorously quantifying\nuncertainty. In this work, we compare four emulator-based Bayesian calibration\nmethods: Calibrate-Emulate-Sample (CES), History Matching (HM), Bayesian\nOptimal Experimental Design (BOED), and a novel Goal-Oriented BOED (GBOED)\napproach, using the Lorenz '96 multiscale system as a testbed. Our GBOED\nformulation explicitly targets calibration-relevant quantities and leverages\ninformation-theoretic criteria for data selection. We assess each method in\nterms of calibration accuracy, uncertainty quantification, computational cost,\nand convergence behavior. We evaluate each method's performance in balancing\ncomputational cost, implementation complexity, and uncertainty quantification\n(UQ), with additional insights into convergence behavior as model evaluations\nincrease. We find CES offers excellent performance but at high computational\nexpense, while GBOED achieves comparable accuracy using fewer model\nevaluations. Standard BOED underperforms with respect to calibration accuracy,\nand HM shows moderate effectiveness but can be useful as a precursor. Our\nresults highlight trade-offs among Bayesian strategies and demonstrate the\npromise of goal-oriented design in calibration workflows.",

    "abstract": "Modern causal language models, followed by rapid developments in discrete\ndiffusion models, can now produce a wide variety of interesting and useful\ncontent. However, these families of models are predominantly trained to output\ntokens with a fixed (left-to-right) or random order, which may deviate from the\nlogical order in which tokens are generated originally. In this paper, we\nobserve that current causal and diffusion models encounter difficulties in\nproblems that require adaptive token generation orders to solve tractably,\nwhich we characterize with the $\\mathcal{V}$-information framework. Motivated\nby this, we propose Reinforced Context Order Recovery (ReCOR), a\nreinforcement-learning-based framework to extract adaptive, data-dependent\ntoken generation orders from text data without annotations. Self-supervised by\ntoken prediction statistics, ReCOR estimates the hardness of predicting every\nunfilled token and adaptively selects the next token during both training and\ninference. Experiments on challenging reasoning and planning datasets\ndemonstrate the superior performance of ReCOR compared with baselines,\nsometimes outperforming oracle models supervised with the ground-truth order.",

Addressing timing violations at this early stage is essential, as\nmodern systems demand higher speeds, where even minor timing violations can\nlead to functional failures or system crashes. However, traditional timing\noptimization heavily relies on manual expertise, requiring engineers to\niteratively analyze timing reports and debug. To automate this process, this\npaper proposes ViTAD, a method that efficiently analyzes the root causes of\ntiming violations and dynamically generates targeted repair strategies.\nSpecifically, we first parse Verilog code and timing reports to construct a\nSignal Timing Dependency Graph (STDG). Based on the STDG, we perform violation\npath analysis and use large language models (LLMs) to infer the root causes of\nviolations. Finally, by analyzing the causes of violations, we selectively\nretrieve relevant debugging knowledge from a domain-specific knowledge base to\ngenerate customized repair solutions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our\nmethod, we construct a timing violation dataset based on real-world open-source\nprojects. This dataset contains 54 cases of violations. Experimental results\nshow that our method achieves a 73.68% success rate in repairing timing\nviolations, while the baseline using only LLM is 54.38%.

We adopt a semi-analytic model\nfor the dynamics of forward and reverse shocks generated through an interaction\nbetween an arbitrary magnetized ejecta with a finite thickness and a stratified\ncircumstellar medium. Multiwavelength radiation from forward and reverse shocks\nseen from an arbitrary viewing angle is calculated under a thin-shell\napproximation. Our analysis with multimodal nested sampling methods for GRB\n110213A suggests that the thick shell ejecta naturally explains the shallow\ndecay feature of the X-ray afterglow. The combination of the reverse shock\nemission in the strongly magnetized jet and forward shock emission in the\nweakly magnetized circumstellar medium makes the double peak feature of the\noptical afterglows. The estimated low radiative efficiency in the prompt phase\nmay be a consequence of the high magnetization of the jet in this case.

    "abstract": "Inventory management in dynamic and competitive business environments\npresents multidimensional challenges, particularly in the face of demand\nuncertainty and logistical and financial constraints. In this context, accurate\ndemand forecasting is critical for optimizing resources and anticipating market\nfluctuations. However, the isolated use of traditional metrics such as Mean\nAbsolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) can lead to biased\nevaluations and limit model robustness. To address this limitation, we propose\nthe Hierarchical Evaluation Function (HEF), a composite function that\nintegrates R2, MAE, and RMSE under a hierarchical and dynamic framework,\ncomplemented by adaptive penalties. The study implements HEF in the\noptimization of multiple prediction models, applying Grid Search, Particle\nSwarm Optimization (PSO), and Optuna, and evaluating their performance on\nreference databases (Walmart, M3, M4, and M5). The results, validated using\nstatistical tests, confirm that HEF consistently outperforms the MAE used as\nthe evaluation function in global metrics such as R2, Global Relative\nPrecision, RMSE, and RMSSE, improving explanatory power and stability against\nextreme errors. In contrast, the MAE retains advantages in simplicity and\ncomputational efficiency. In summary, HEF constitutes a robust and adaptive\nalternative for highly variable environments, providing a solid framework for\nmodel selection and hyperparameter optimization.",

Our first focus is\nthe \\emph{Weighted Prize-Collecting Partition Vertex Cover} (WP-PVC) problem:\ngiven a graph with weights on both vertices and edges, and a partition of the\nedge set into $\\omega$ groups, the goal is to select a minimum-weight subset of\nvertices such that, in each group, the total weight (profit) of covered edges\nmeets a specified threshold. This formulation generalizes classical vertex\ncover, partial vertex cover and partition vertex cover.\n  We present two algorithms for WP-PVC. The first is a simple 2-approximation\nthat solves \\( n^{\\omega} \\) LP's, improving over prior work by Bandyapadhyay\net al.\\ by removing an enumerative step and the extra \\( \\epsilon \\)-factor in\napproximation, while also extending to the weighted setting. The second is a\nbi-criteria algorithm that applies when \\( \\omega \\) is large, approximately\nmeeting profit targets with a bounded LP-relative cost.\n  We also study a natural generalization of the edge cover problem, the\n\\emph{Weighted Partition Edge Cover} (W-PEC) problem, where each edge has an\nassociated weights, and the vertex set is partitioned into groups. For each\ngroup, the goal is to cover at least a specified number of vertices using\nincident edges, while minimizing the total weight of the selected edges.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted technique for compressing\nlarge models into smaller, more efficient student models that can be deployed\non devices with limited computational resources. Among various KD methods,\nRelational Knowledge Distillation (RKD) improves student performance by\naligning relational structures in the feature space, such as pairwise distances\nand angles. In this work, we propose Quantum Relational Knowledge Distillation\n(QRKD), which extends RKD by incorporating quantum relational information.\nSpecifically, we map classical features into a Hilbert space, interpret them as\nquantum states, and compute quantum kernel values to capture richer\ninter-sample relationships. These quantum-informed relations are then used to\nguide the distillation process. We evaluate QRKD on both vision and language\ntasks, including CNNs on MNIST and CIFAR-10, and GPT-2 on WikiText-2, Penn\nTreebank, and IMDB. Across all benchmarks, QRKD consistently improves student\nmodel performance compared to classical RKD. Importantly, both teacher and\nstudent models remain classical and deployable on standard hardware, with\nquantum computation required only during training.

We\nreport the discovery of a cosmic filament using 14 HI-selected galaxies that\nform a very thin elongated structure of 1.7 Mpc. These galaxies are embedded\nwithin a much larger cosmic web filament, traced by optical galaxies, that\nspans at least $\\sim 15$~Mpc.

This\nstructure demonstrates that within the cosmic filament, the angular momentum of\ngalaxies is closely connected to the large-scale filamentary structure. We also\nfind strong evidence that the galaxies are orbiting around the spine of the\nfilament, making this one of the largest rotating structures discovered thus\nfar, and from which we can infer that there is transfer of angular momentum\nfrom the filament to the individual galaxies. The abundance of HI galaxies\nalong the filament and the low dynamical temperature of the galaxies within the\nfilament indicates that this filament is at an early evolutionary stage where\nthe imprint of cosmic matter flow on galaxies has been preserved over cosmic\ntime.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving\nremarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing\ntasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model\nsizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and\nenergy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has\nemerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency\nwithout the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing\npruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require\ncomputationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a\nnovel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained\nLLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages\nboth weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate\nredundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,\nand easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM\narchitectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of\nstandard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner\nsurpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight\nupdates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the\nhighest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy.

In\nresponse, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment\nmodels with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.\nSpecifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac\nknowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these\nplans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific\ncustomization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine\nplans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as\ncomplex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to\ninterpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When\nclinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final\nvalidation.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities but\nremain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, which can elicit harmful content\nfrom the models by manipulating the input prompts. Existing black-box\njailbreaking techniques primarily rely on static prompts crafted with a single,\nnon-adaptive strategy, or employ rigid combinations of several underperforming\nattack methods, which limits their adaptability and generalization. To address\nthese limitations, we propose MAJIC, a Markovian adaptive jailbreaking\nframework that attacks black-box LLMs by iteratively combining diverse\ninnovative disguise strategies. MAJIC first establishes a ``Disguise Strategy\nPool'' by refining existing strategies and introducing several innovative\napproaches. To further improve the attack performance and efficiency, MAJIC\nformulate the sequential selection and fusion of strategies in the pool as a\nMarkov chain. Under this formulation, MAJIC initializes and employs a Markov\nmatrix to guide the strategy composition, where transition probabilities\nbetween strategies are dynamically adapted based on attack outcomes, thereby\nenabling MAJIC to learn and discover effective attack pathways tailored to the\ntarget model. Our empirical results demonstrate that MAJIC significantly\noutperforms existing jailbreak methods on prominent models such as GPT-4o and\nGemini-2.0-flash, achieving over 90\\% attack success rate with fewer than 15\nqueries per attempt on average.",

To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models\n(SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of\ndata for cramming training. In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking,\nwhich resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition.\nHowever, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is\nfirst acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two\ndistinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA\nInteraction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input\nthe question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create\nknowledge-enhanced datasets. Subsequently, we train a LoRA block on the student\nmodel as an Intuitive Reasoner (IR), which directly generates Chain-of-Thoughts\nfor problem-solving. Then, to imitate System 2 thinking, we train the Knowledge\nGenerator (KG) and Deep Reasoner (DR), respectively. The former outputs only\nknowledge after receiving problems, while the latter uses that knowledge to\nperform reasoning. Finally, to address the randomness in the generation of IR\nand DR, we evaluate whether their outputs are consistent, and the inference\nprocess needs to be iterated if not. This step can enhance the mathematical\nreasoning ability of SLMs through mutual feedback. Experimental results show\nthat LoRID achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially on the GSM8K\ndataset, where it outperforms the second-best method by 2.3%, 16.1%, 2.4%,\n12.3%, and 1.8% accuracy across the five base models, respectively.",

Beyond achieving\nquantitative accuracy, FEMION offers a many-body bonding analysis that reveals\nwhy DFT fails to capture the CO adsorption preference, highlighting the\ncritical role of electron correlation in governing surface energetics.

On CAUEEG,\nEEG-MSAF-SVM achieves \\textbf{89\\% $\\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, surpassing the deep\nlearning baseline CEEDNET by \\textbf{19.3\\%}. On the Thessaloniki dataset, it\nreaches \\textbf{95\\% $\\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, comparable to EEGConvNeXt. SHAP\nanalysis identifies mean correlation and occurrence as the most informative\nmetrics: disruption of microstate C (salience/attention network) dominates DEM\nprediction, while microstate F, a novel default-mode pattern, emerges as a key\nearly biomarker for both MCI and DEM.

Cybersecurity is heavily\ndependent on threat modeling, as it assists security experts in assessing and\nmitigating risks related to identifying vulnerabilities and threats.

The density enhancement raises the local opacity, which\namplifies the radiative temperature gradient $\\nabla_{\\rm rad}$. If this\ngradient surpasses the Ledoux threshold $\\nabla_{\\rm L}$, defined by both\nthermal and compositional stratification, the region becomes convectively\nunstable.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in masked diffusion models (MDMs) have established them as\npowerful non-autoregressive alternatives for sequence generation. Nevertheless,\nour preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still\nhighly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely\nadopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of\nglobal trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the\nearly stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of\nMDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling\n(PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning\nwith content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a\nposition-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a\ncalibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial\ntokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging\nbenchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that\nPC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more\nthan 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with\nstate-of-the-art autoregressive models.

    "abstract": "E-graphs have attracted growing interest in many fields, particularly in\nlogic synthesis and formal verification. E-graph extraction is a challenging\nNP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It requires identifying optimal\nterms from exponentially many equivalent expressions, serving as the primary\nperformance bottleneck in e-graph based optimization tasks. However,\ntraditional extraction methods face a critical trade-off: heuristic approaches\noffer speed but sacrifice optimality, while exact methods provide optimal\nsolutions but face prohibitive computational costs on practical problems. We\npresent e-boost, a novel framework that bridges this gap through three key\ninnovations: (1) parallelized heuristic extraction that leverages weak data\ndependence to compute DAG costs concurrently, enabling efficient multi-threaded\nperformance without sacrificing extraction quality; (2) adaptive search space\npruning that employs a parameterized threshold mechanism to retain only\npromising candidates, dramatically reducing the solution space while preserving\nnear-optimal solutions; and (3) initialized exact solving that formulates the\nreduced problem as an Integer Linear Program with warm-start capabilities,\nguiding solvers toward high-quality solutions faster.\n  Across the diverse benchmarks in formal verification and logic synthesis\nfields, e-boost demonstrates 558x runtime speedup over traditional exact\napproaches (ILP) and 19.04% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art\nextraction framework (SmoothE).

    "abstract": "Solar flare ribbons are believed to map the footpoints of newly reconnected\nmagnetic flux tubes, therefore shedding light on the reconnecting current\nsheet, which is rarely observed by direct imaging or spectroscopy. Here we\nstudy the detailed evolution of flare ribbons down to the arcsecond scale for\n10 flares characterized by the classic double ribbons. Identifying the flaring\npixels by combining the intensity variances of the UV filter ratio and\nintensity threshold, we found that the waiting time distributions of the\nflaring pixels are well described by power laws, distinct from those in the\npreflare or quiet-Sun regions, and that the power-law slopes are generally\nconsistent with those predicted by nonstationary Poisson processes in the\nnonlinear regime or by the 2D/3D self-organized criticality (SOC) model. The\nsize distributions for flaring duration also follow power laws but the slopes\nare more scattered. In contrast, the size distributions for other parameters,\nincluding peak intensity, energy, and radial magnetic field strength of the\nflaring pixels, deviate from power laws, and the estimated slopes significantly\ndiffer from the SOC predictions. These results suggest that a nonstationary\nPoisson process or an avalanche-like process might be ongoing in the temporal\ndimension in the reconnecting current sheet, but in other aspects, e.g., space-\nand energy-wise, the avalanche is likely modulated by other physical processes\nor the fine structures of the reconnecting current sheet.",

Existing HOI generation approaches, such as\ndiffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible\ncontacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder\nsuccessful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of\ngenerative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and\nphysically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion\nTransformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,\nobject geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These\nkey actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into\nsmooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To\nensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy\ntrained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while\ncorrecting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the\ncontrol policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and\ntracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates\nrealistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,\nachieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and\nenabling long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Generally,\nMMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection,\nmodality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation.\nAccordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities,\nlaying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a\ndiscussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and\nannotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on\ndifferent ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the\nauxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental\nconfigurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth\n(D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part\nof the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an\nomni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT),\ncovering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total.

This\nmotivates us to delve into a new Biased Evidential Multi-view Learning (BEML)\nproblem. To this end, we propose Fairness-Aware Multi-view Evidential Learning\n(FAML).

    "abstract": "Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While\nrecent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit\nreasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in\nLSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the\n\"Thinking-before-Speaking\" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,\nthis sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are\ndelayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and\ncommunication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a\nframework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel\n\"Thinking-in-Speaking\" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before\nproducing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning\ntokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows\ncontinuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,\nleveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although\ninterleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response\ntoken is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we\nintroduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for\ninterleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens\nconsistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient\nlearning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker\narchitecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken\nresponses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA\nbenchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in\ncontextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.",

This paper introduces MAGNeT (Multimodal Adaptive Gaussian\nNetworks), which addresses these problems by combining classical statistical\nmodeling with a context-aware multimodal method. MAGNeT dynamically fuses\npre-fitted Ternary-Gaussian models from various scenarios based on real-time\ncontextual cues, enabling effective adaptation with minimal training data while\npreserving model interpretability. We conduct experiments on self-constructed\n2D and 3D moving target selection datasets under in-vehicle vibration\nconditions.

In this study, we investigate this problem by\nsolving Parker's transport equation with 3D MHD simulations of solar flares. By\nexamining energy conversion in the 3D system, we evaluate the roles of\ndifferent acceleration mechanisms, including reconnection current sheet (CS),\ntermination shock (TS), and supra-arcade downflows (SADs). We find that\nlarge-amplitude turbulent fluctuations are generated and sustained in the 3D\nsystem. The model results demonstrate that a significant number of electrons\nare accelerated to hundreds of keV and even a few MeV, forming power-law energy\nspectra. These energetic particles are widely distributed, with concentrations\nat the TS and in the flare looptop region, consistent with results derived from\nrecent hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave (MW) observations. By selectively turning\nparticle acceleration on or off in specific regions, we find that the CS and\nSADs effectively accelerate electrons to several hundred keV, while the TS\nenables further acceleration to MeV. However, no single mechanism can\nindependently account for the significant number of energetic electrons\nobserved. Instead, the mechanisms work synergistically to produce a large\npopulation of accelerated electrons. Our model provides spatially and\ntemporally resolved electron distributions in the whole flare region and at the\nflare footpoints, enabling synthetic HXR and MW emission modeling for\ncomparison with observations. These results offer important insights into\nelectron acceleration and transport in 3D solar flare regions.",

More\nprecisely, we obtain a probabilistic representation of its Barenblatt solutions\nas the one-dimensional marginal density curve of the unique solutions to the\nassociated McKean--Vlasov SDE. The latter is of novel type, since its\ncoefficients depend pointwise both on its solution's time marginal densities\nand also on their first and second order derivatives. Moreover, we show that\nthese solutions constitute the aforementioned nonlinear Markov process, which\nwe call the Leibenson process. A further main result of this work is to prove\nthat despite the strong degeneracy of the diffusion and the irregularity of the\ndrift coefficient (which is merely of bounded variation) of the McKean--Vlasov\nSDE these solutions are probabilistically strong, i.e., measurable functionals\nof the driving Brownian motion and the initial condition.",

The existing proxies often rely on\nlabelled data, which is usually unavailable in real-world settings.\nFurthermore, the majority of the current methods focus either on optimising the\nconvergence and generalisation attributes or solely on the expressivity of the\nnetwork architectures. To address both limitations, we first demonstrate how\nchannel collinearity affects the convergence and generalisation properties of a\nneural network. Then, by incorporating the convergence, generalisation and\nexpressivity in one approach, we propose a zero-cost proxy that omits the\nrequirement of labelled data for its computation. In particular, we leverage\nthe Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the neural network layer features and\nthe extrinsic curvature of the network output to design our proxy. %As a\nresult, the proposed proxy is formulated as the simplified harmonic mean of the\nlogarithms of two key components: the sum of the inverse of the feature\ncondition number and the extrinsic curvature of the network output. Our\napproach enables accurate prediction of network performance on test data using\nonly a single label-free data sample. Our extensive evaluation includes a total\nof six experiments, including the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) search\nspace, i.e. DARTS and the Transformer search space, i.e. AutoFormer.

We\ntrain a multi-layer spiking network, as a conceptual analog of the bottom-up\nvisual hierarchy, for visual input classification using spike-time encoding.\nAfter learning, we observe the development of distinct spatio-temporal activity\npatterns. While input patterns are synchronous by construction, activity in\nearly layers first spreads out over time, followed by re-convergence into sharp\npulses as classes are gradually extracted. The emergence of synchronicity is\naccompanied by the formation of increasingly distinct pathways, reflecting the\ngradual semantization of input activity. We thus observe hierarchical networks\nlearning spike latency codes to naturally acquire activity patterns\ncharacterized by synchronicity and separability, with pronounced excitatory\npathways ascending through the layers. This provides a rigorous computational\nhypothesis for the experimentally observed synchronicity in the visual system\nas a natural consequence of deep learning in cortex.",

However, in applications,\nautoregressive signals are often corrupted by additive noise. Further, the\nautoregressive process and the corruptive noise may be highly impulsive,\nstemming from an infinite-variance distribution. The model estimation\ntechniques that account for additional noise tend to show reduced efficacy when\nthere is very strong noise present in the data, especially when the noise is\nheavy-tailed.

Current approaches, such as factorized attention and\nfixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal\nredundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion\ntransformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit\nstructured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads\ndynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern,\ncross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods\neither impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting\ntheir effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a\nhardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive\ntiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via\ndynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity\nlevels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search\nalgorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention\npathways.

Also, they use a single connection WAN BW that cannot capture actual\nWAN capacities between distant DCs. Such inaccurate WAN BWs yield sub-optimal\ndecisions, inflating overall query latency and cost. In this paper, we present\nWANify, a new framework that precisely and dynamically gauges achievable\nruntime WAN BW using a machine learning prediction scheme, decision tree-based\nRandom Forest.

However, its application in medical imaging remains\nunderexplored. Existing reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) approaches in this\ndomain primarily target closed-ended visual question answering (VQA), limiting\ntheir applicability to real-world clinical reasoning. In contrast, open-ended\nmedical VQA better reflects clinical practice but has received limited\nattention. While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via\nsemantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often\nsuffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic\ndifferences receive similar scores. To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive\nReinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended\nmedical VQA. ARMed first incorporates domain knowledge through supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data, then applies reinforcement learning\nwith textual correctness and adaptive semantic rewards to enhance reasoning\nquality. We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks. Results\nshow that ARMed consistently boosts both accuracy and generalization, achieving\na 32.64% improvement on in-domain tasks and an 11.65% gain on out-of-domain\nbenchmarks.

Turbulent photospheric convection\nslowly displaces the footpoints of coronal field lines, causing them to become\ntwisted and tangled. Magnetic stresses gradually build until reaching a\nbreaking point when the field reconnects and releases a sudden burst of energy.\nWe simulate this basic picture of nanoflares using a high-fidelity,\nthree-dimensional, multi-stranded magnetohydrodynamic simulation that starts\nwith a fully stratified atmosphere. This simulation includes the effects of\nfield-aligned thermal conduction and optically thin radiation and uses the\nstate-of-the-art Transition Region Adaptive Conduction (TRAC) method to capture\nthe response of the plasma to the nanoflare heating. We find that our physical\nmodel supports a unified explanation for both the diffuse emission observed in\nactive regions and the bright coronal loops. Specifically, our results suggest\nthat the diffuse emission originates from spatially and temporally uncorrelated\nnanoflares, whereas coherent clusters of nanoflares - nanoflare storms - are\nresponsible for the formation of bright coronal loops.

    "abstract": "This paper will provide several classes of strictly stationary,\ncountable-state, irreducible, aperiodic Markov chains that are reversible and\nhave finite second moments, such that the central limit theorem fails to hold.\nThe main purpose is to examine the extent to which, for the development of\ncentral limit theory for strictly stationary Markov chains (and functions of\nthem) under the strong mixing and absolute regularity conditions, the property\nof reversibility (if it holds) can provide extra leverage. It is known, partly\nas a by-product of research done by Roberts, Rosenthal, and Tweedie in two\npapers in 1997 and 2001, that for the case of exponential mixing rates,\nreversibility provides notable extra leverage of that kind. In contrast, a\nclass of counterexamples in a paper of Doukhan, Massart, and Rio in 1994 showed\n(implicitly) that for the case of power-type mixing rates, reversibility\napparently provides almost no such extra leverage. Further perspective on that\nlatter fact will be provided by some counterexamples in this paper. Other\ncounterexamples here will (indirectly) provide some tentative, uncertain\nevidence for the possibility that for mixing rates that are ``between''\npower-type and exponential (for example, sub-exponential), reversibility may in\nfact provide some small but nontrivial extra leverage.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the first method for constructing bases for polynomial\nspline spaces over an arbitrary T-meshes (PT-splines for short). We construct\nspline basis functions for an arbitrary T-mesh by first converting the T-mesh\ninto a diagonalizable one via edge extension, ensuring a stable dimension of\nthe spline space. Basis functions over the diagoalizable T-mesh are constructed\naccording to the three components in the dimension formula corresponding to\ncross-cuts, rays, and T $l$-edges in the diagonalizable T-mesh, and each\ncomponent is assigned some local tensor product B-splines as the basis\nfunctions. We prove this set of functions constitutes a basis for the\ndiagonalizable T-mesh. To remove redundant edges from extension, we introduce a\ntechnique, termed Extended Edge Elimination (EEE) to construct a basis for an\narbitrary T-mesh while reducing structural constraints and unnecessary\nrefinements. The resulting PT-spline basis ensures linear independence and\ncompleteness, supported by a dedicated construction algorithm. A comparison\nwith LR B-splines, which may lack linear independence and are limited to\nLR-meshes, highlights the PT-spline's versatility across any T-mesh. Examples\nare also provided to demonstrate that dimensional instability in spline spaces\nis related with basis function degradation and that PT-splines are advantageous\nover HB-splines for certain hierarchical T-meshes.",

Here, we\ndemonstrate that L\\\"owdin symmetric orthogonalization (LSO) outperforms the\nwidely used Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) in characterizing and\nquantifying quantum resources, with particular emphasis on coherence and\nsuperposition. We employ LSO both to construct an orthogonal basis from a\nnon-orthogonal one and to obtain a non-orthogonal basis from an orthogonal set,\nthereby avoiding any ambiguity related to the basis choice for quantum\ncoherence. Unlike GSO, which depends on the ordering of input states, LSO\napplies a symmetric transformation that treats all vectors equally and\nminimizes deviation from the original basis. This approach generates basis sets\nwith enhanced stability and physical relevance, facilitating the analysis of\nsuperpositions in non-orthogonal quantum states. Building on LSO, we also\nintroduce L\\\"owdin weights -- probabilistic weights for non-orthogonal\nrepresentations that provide a consistent measure of resource content. These\nweights further enable basis-independent quantification of coherence and state\ndelocalization through information-theoretic measures such as entropy and\nparticipation ratios. Our theoretical and numerical analyses confirm LSO's\nsuperior preservation of quantum state symmetry and resource characteristics,\nunderscoring the critical role of orthogonalization methods and L\\\"owdin\nweights in resource theory frameworks.",

In\nself-supervised skeleton-based action recognition, the mask-based\nreconstruction paradigm learns the spatial structure and motion patterns of the\nskeleton by masking joints and reconstructing the target from unlabeled data.\nHowever, existing methods focus on a limited set of joints and low-order motion\npatterns, limiting the model's ability to understand complex motion patterns.\nTo address this issue, we introduce MaskSem, a novel semantic-guided masking\nmethod for learning 3D hybrid high-order motion representations. This novel\nframework leverages Grad-CAM based on relative motion to guide the masking of\njoints, which can be represented as the most semantically rich temporal\norgions. The semantic-guided masking process can encourage the model to explore\nmore discriminative features. Furthermore, we propose using hybrid high-order\nmotion as the reconstruction target, enabling the model to learn multi-order\nmotion patterns. Specifically, low-order motion velocity and high-order motion\nacceleration are used together as the reconstruction target. This approach\noffers a more comprehensive description of the dynamic motion process,\nenhancing the model's understanding of motion patterns. Experiments on the\nNTU60, NTU120, and PKU-MMD datasets show that MaskSem, combined with a vanilla\ntransformer, improves skeleton-based action recognition, making it more\nsuitable for applications in human-robot interaction.",

During translation, it is essential to\npreserve the original properties of the foreground, e.g., albedo, and propagate\nconsistent relighting among temporal frames. In this paper, we propose Lumen,\nan end-to-end video relighting framework developed on large-scale video\ngenerative models, receiving flexible textual description for instructing the\ncontrol of lighting and background. Considering the scarcity of high-qualified\npaired videos with the same foreground in various lighting conditions, we\nconstruct a large-scale dataset with a mixture of realistic and synthetic\nvideos. For the synthetic domain, benefiting from the abundant 3D assets in the\ncommunity, we leverage advanced 3D rendering engine to curate video pairs in\ndiverse environments. For the realistic domain, we adapt a HDR-based lighting\nsimulation to complement the lack of paired in-the-wild videos. Powered by the\naforementioned dataset, we design a joint training curriculum to effectively\nunleash the strengths of each domain, i.e., the physical consistency in\nsynthetic videos, and the generalized domain distribution in realistic videos.\nTo implement this, we inject a domain-aware adapter into the model to decouple\nthe learning of relighting and domain appearance distribution. We construct a\ncomprehensive benchmark to evaluate Lumen together with existing methods, from\nthe perspectives of foreground preservation and video consistency assessment.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Lumen effectively edit the input into\ncinematic relighted videos with consistent lighting and strict foreground\npreservation.

In particular, we reframe the entire security analysis of this protocol\nas a strongly convex optimization problem and demonstrate that unlike the\noriginal security proof, optimization of Bob's measurement angles for finding a\nlower bound on Eve's uncertainty about Alice's key generation basis can be done\nwith lesser cost. We derive an explicit form of the pessimistic error that\narises while optimizing the measurement angles of both the parties. We also\nclarify a few parts of the original security proof, making the analysis more\nrigorous and complete.",

    "abstract": "The growing proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) is\nsignificantly enhancing the resilience and reliability of distribution systems.\nHowever, a substantial portion of behind-the-meter (BTM) DERs is often\noverlooked during black start (BS) and restoration processes. Existing BS\nstrategies that utilize grid-forming (GFM) battery energy storage systems\n(BESS) frequently ignore critical frequency security and synchronization\nconstraints. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a predictive\nframework for bottom-up BS that leverages the flexibility of BTM DERs through\nGrid Edge Intelligence (GEI). A predictive model is developed for GEI to\nestimate multi-period flexibility ranges and track dispatch signals from the\nutility. A frequency-constrained BS strategy is then introduced, explicitly\nincorporating constraints on frequency nadir, rate-of-change-of-frequency\n(RoCoF), and quasi-steady-state (QSS) frequency. The framework also includes\nsynchronizing switches to enable faster and more secure load restoration.\nNotably, it requires GEI devices to communicate only their flexibility ranges\nand the utility to send dispatch signals without exchanging detailed asset\ninformation. The proposed framework is validated using a modified IEEE 123-bus\ntest system, and the impact of GEI is demonstrated by comparing results across\nvarious GEI penetration scenarios.",

Additionally, we\nincorporate an explicit reasoning process during response generation to further\nenhance the quality, relevance, and contextual appropriateness of the system's\nresponses. We evaluate the backbone policy model on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct models, testing the proposed RLFF-ESC framework across two\npublic ESC datasets.

We find that O-rich dust, particularly silicates, dominates the dust\nbudget, with masses ranging from 0.02 to 0.9 Msun, and that the total mass of\nO-rich dust increases with progenitor mass. C-rich amorphous carbon dust is\nsignificant for lower-mass progenitors (up to 15 Msun), but its mass never\nexceeds 0.05 Msun. For progenitors up to 30 Msun, we provide best-fit functions\ndescribing the masses of O-rich dust, C-rich dust, and CO molecules. A large\nstochastic variation is found in the predicted masses of silicate dust, which\ncorrelates with the randomness of shell-merger events in the pre-explosion\nphases of massive stars. Furthermore, we show that the dust mass for a given\nprogenitor can vary by a factor of 2-5, reflecting differences in pre-explosion\nabundance profiles predicted by the stellar evolution codes KEPLER and MESA.

    "abstract": "In incremental learning, enhancing the generality of knowledge is crucial for\nadapting to dynamic data inputs. It can develop generalized representations or\nmore balanced decision boundaries, preventing the degradation of long-term\nknowledge over time and thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Some emerging\nincremental learning methods adopt an encoder-decoder architecture and have\nachieved promising results. In the encoder-decoder achitecture, improving the\ngeneralization capabilities of both the encoder and decoder is critical, as it\nhelps preserve previously learned knowledge while ensuring adaptability and\nrobustness to new, diverse data inputs. However, many existing continual\nmethods focus solely on enhancing one of the two components, which limits their\neffectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. And these methods perform\neven worse in small-memory scenarios, where only a limited number of historical\nsamples can be stored. To mitigate this limitation, we introduces SEDEG, a\ntwo-stage training framework for vision transformers (ViT), focusing on\nsequentially improving the generality of both Decoder and Encoder. Initially,\nSEDEG trains an ensembled encoder through feature boosting to learn generalized\nrepresentations, which subsequently enhance the decoder's generality and\nbalance the classifier. The next stage involves using knowledge distillation\n(KD) strategies to compress the ensembled encoder and develop a new, more\ngeneralized encoder. This involves using a balanced KD approach and feature KD\nfor effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark\ndatasets show SEDEG's superior performance, and ablation studies confirm the\nefficacy of its components.

    "abstract": "Over the past eight years, the META method has served as a multidimensional\ntesting skill assessment system in the National College Student Contest on\nSoftware Testing, successfully assessing over 100,000 students' testing skills.\nHowever, META is primarily limited to the objective assessment of test scripts,\nlacking the ability to automatically assess subjective aspects such as test\ncase and test report. To address this limitation, this paper proposes RUM, a\ncomprehensive assessment approach that combines rules and large language models\n(LLMs). RUM achieves a comprehensive assessment by rapidly processing objective\nindicators through rules while utilizing LLMs for in-depth subjective analysis\nof test case documents, test scripts, and test reports. The experimental\nresults show that compared to traditional manual testing skill assessment, RUM\nimproves assessment efficiency by 80.77\\% and reduces costs by 97.38\\%, while\nmaintaining high accuracy and consistency of assessment. By applying RUM on the\ncontest on software testing, we find that it not only enhances the efficiency\nand scalability of skill assessment in software testing education, but also\nprovides teachers with more comprehensive and objective evidence for student\nability assessment, facilitating personalized teaching and learning. This study\noffers new insights into the assessment of testing skills, which are expected\nto promote further development in test process optimization and software\nquality assurance.",

In this paper, we introduce a\nmulti-stage cross-modal fusion 3D detection framework, termed CMF-IOU, to\neffectively address the challenge of aligning 3D spatial and 2D semantic\ninformation. Specifically, we first project the pixel information into 3D space\nvia a depth completion network to get the pseudo points, which unifies the\nrepresentation of the LiDAR and camera information. Then, a bilateral\ncross-view enhancement 3D backbone is designed to encode LiDAR points and\npseudo points. The first sparse-to-distant (S2D) branch utilizes an\nencoder-decoder structure to reinforce the representation of sparse LiDAR\npoints. The second residual view consistency (ResVC) branch is proposed to\nmitigate the influence of inaccurate pseudo points via both the 3D and 2D\nconvolution processes. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative voxel-point\naware fine grained pooling module, which captures the spatial information from\nLiDAR points and textural information from pseudo points in the proposal\nrefinement stage. To achieve more precise refinement during iteration, an\nintersection over union (IoU) joint prediction branch integrated with a novel\nproposals generation technique is designed to preserve the bounding boxes with\nboth high IoU and classification scores.

    "abstract": "The growing demand for sparse tensor algebra (SpTA) in machine learning and\nbig data has driven the development of various sparse tensor accelerators.\nHowever, most existing manually designed accelerators are limited to specific\nscenarios, and it's time-consuming and challenging to adjust a large number of\ndesign factors when scenarios change. Therefore, automating the design of SpTA\naccelerators is crucial. Nevertheless, previous works focus solely on either\nmapping (i.e., tiling communication and computation in space and time) or\nsparse strategy (i.e., bypassing zero elements for efficiency), leading to\nsuboptimal designs due to the lack of comprehensive consideration of both. A\nunified framework that jointly optimizes both is urgently needed. However,\nintegrating mapping and sparse strategies leads to a combinatorial explosion in\nthe design space(e.g., as large as $O(10^{41})$ for the workload $P_{32 \\times\n64} \\times Q_{64 \\times 48} = Z_{32 \\times 48}$). This vast search space\nrenders most conventional optimization methods (e.g., particle swarm\noptimization, reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search) inefficient.\nTo address this challenge, we propose an evolution strategy-based sparse tensor\naccelerator optimization framework, called SparseMap. SparseMap constructing a\nmore comprehensive design space with the consideration of both mapping and\nsparse strategy. We introduce a series of enhancements to genetic encoding and\nevolutionary operators, enabling SparseMap to efficiently explore the vast and\ndiverse design space. We quantitatively compare SparseMap with prior works and\nclassical optimization methods, demonstrating that SparseMap consistently finds\nsuperior solutions.",

    "abstract": "Numerical simulations of geological CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers have\ndemonstrated that vertical equilibrium (VE) models offer a robust and\ncomputationally efficient framework for reservoir optimization and upscaling.\nThese studies emphasize the influence of fines migration and partial\nmiscibility between water and CO2 on the evolving storage behaviour.\nSpecifically, capillary-driven mobilization of clay and silica fines can impair\ninjectivity, while water evaporation into the CO2 phase leads to near-wellbore\ndrying, salt precipitation, and additional injectivity loss. However,\nconventional VE models do not account for these coupled physical and\ngeochemical mechanisms. This work introduces an extended VE model that\nincorporates water vaporization into CO2, CO2 dissolution into the displaced\nbrine, and fines migration leading to permeability reduction. For layer-cake\naquifers, the model admits an exact analytical solution, providing closed-form\nexpressions for both injectivity decline and sweep efficiency. The analysis\nidentifies two distinct fronts during displacement: a leading\ndisplacement-dissolution front and a trailing full-evaporation front. Vertical\nmodel downscaling further reveals that gas saturation varies with the\ndepth-dependent permeability profile. In formations where permeability\ndecreases with depth, saturation declines monotonically; in contrast, in\nsystems with increasing permeability, the competition between viscous and\ngravitational forces can generate non-monotonic saturation profiles. The\nresults also indicate that while fines migration reduces injectivity, it may\nsimultaneously enhance sweep efficiency; highlighting a complex trade-off that\nmust be considered in the design and optimization of CO2 storage operations.",

While extant Chandra and XMM-Newton observations have\ndetected X-ray emission in PNe, the numbers known remain very small ($\\sim40$)\ncompared to the overall Galactic PNe population ($\\sim4000$). We have initiated\na project aimed at increasing the sample of known PNe with X-ray emission using\nboth current and new space-based X-ray telescopes such as the Einstein probe.\nTo further investigate their X-ray properties to elucidate what drives current\nX-ray PN detections, we have cross-searched the SRG {\\it eROSITA-DE} eRASS1\nsource catalogue and Hong Kong (HASH) PNe Database. Five known X-ray PNe have\nbeen detected (Abell\\,30, NGC\\,2392, NGC\\,3242, NGC\\,5315, and LoTr\\,5), two\nnew X-ray PNe are revealed (IC\\,1297 and NGC\\,2867), one (K\\,1-27) is removed\nfrom previous X-ray compilations, and another 11 previously detected X-ray\nemitting PNe are not recovered. A comparison of the X-ray flux of detected and\nundetected X-ray PNe reveals that eROSITA eRASS1 is sensitive to PNe with X-ray\nfluxes larger than $\\approx2\\times10^{-14}$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$.

Assuming\ntheir stability under tensor product, we prove that the optimal error exponent\nfor discrimination is precisely given by the regularized quantum Chernoff\ndivergence between the sets. Furthermore, leveraging minimax theorems, we show\nthat discriminating between sets of quantum states is no harder than\ndiscriminating between their worst-case elements in terms of error probability.\nThis implies the existence of a universal optimal test that achieves the\nminimum error probability for all states in the sets, matching the performance\nof the optimal test for the most challenging states. We provide explicit\ncharacterizations of the universal optimal test in the binary composite case.\nFinally, we show that the maximum overlap between a pure state and a set of\nfree states, a quantity that frequently arises in quantum resource theories, is\nequal to the quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets, thereby providing an\noperational interpretation of this quantity in the context of symmetric\nhypothesis testing.",

    "abstract": "CMOS-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) has attracted\nsignificant attention as a promising candidate for in-memory computing (IMC)\ndue to its extremely low power consumption. However, conventional FTJs face\ninherent challenges and hinder their practical applications. Insufficient\ncurrent density (JON) and limited on-off current ratios in FTJs are primarily\nconstrained by their dependence on direct tunneling (DT) and Fowler-Nordheim\n(FN) tunneling mechanisms. Building on previous experimental results, this\npaper proposes a trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)-based FTJ that leverages the TAT\nmechanism to overcome these limitations. A comprehensive FTJ model integrating\nferroelectric (FE) switching, DT, FN tunneling, and TAT mechanisms is\ndeveloped, enabling detailed analyses of the trap conditions and their impact\non performance. Through systematic optimization of trap parameters and device\nstructure, the TAT-based FTJ achieves ultra-high JON and a remarkable on-off\ncurrent ratio, meeting the nanoscale IMC requirements. The results highlight\nthe potential of TAT-based FTJs as high-performance memory solutions for IMC\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Quantum sinh-Gordon model in 1+1 dimensions is one of the simplest and\nbest-studied massive integrable relativistic quantum field theories. We\nconsider this theory on a multi-sheeted Riemann surfaces with a flat metric,\nwhich can be seen as a pile of planes connected to each other along cut lines.\nThe cut lines end at branch points, which are represented by a twist operator\n${\\cal T}_n.$ Operators of such kind are interesting in the framework of the\nproblem of computing von Neumann and Renyi entanglement entropies in the\noriginal model on the plane. The composite branch-point twist operators (CTO)\nare a natural generalization of the twist operators, obtained by placing a\nlocal operator to a branch point by means of a certain limiting procedure.\n  Correlation function in quantum field theory can be, in principle, found by\nmeans of the spectral decomposition. It allows one to express them in terms of\nform factors of local operators, i.e. their matrix elements in the basis of\nstationary states. In integrable models complete sets of exact form factors of\nall operators can be found exactly as solutions of a system of bootstrap\nequations. Nevertheless, identification of these solution to the operators in\nterms of the basic fields remains problematic. In this work, we develop a\ntechnique of computing form factors of a class of CTO determined in terms of\nthe basic field in the semiclassical approximation.",

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel fine-tuning\nmethod, Manifold-Preserving and Sculpting Tuning (MPS-Tuning). Regarding the\ndata distribution in feature space as a semantic manifold, MPS-Tuning\nexplicitly constrains the intrinsic geometry of this manifold while further\nsculpting it to enhance class separability. Specifically, MPS-Tuning preserves\nboth macroscopic and microscopic topological structures of the original\nmanifold by aligning Gram matrices of features before and after fine-tuning.\nTheoretically, this constraint is shown to approximate an upper bound of the\nGromov-Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, features from the image and text\nmodalities are paired, and pairwise similarities are optimized to enhance the\nmanifold's class discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nMPS-Tuning significantly improves model performance while effectively\npreserving the structure of the semantic manifold. The code will be released.",

Here we show that, in the stochastic version of the Eigen\nmodel, there is also a fidelity catastrophe. This arises due to the\nstate-dependence of fluctuations and occurs when rates of mutation fall beneath\na certain threshold, which we calculate. The result is a type of noise-induced\nmultistability whereupon the system stochastically switches between short-lived\nregimes of effectively clonal behavior by different genetic variants.

Personal devices extend trust to the digital domain,\nmaking it desirable to have strictly private communication between trusted\ndevices. Currently, messaging services like WhatsApp provide alternative means\nfor exchanging sensitive private information, while personal safety apps such\nas Noonlight enable private signaling. However, these rely on third-party\nmechanisms for secure and private communication, which may not be accessible\nfor justifiable reasons, such as insecure internet access or companion device\nconnections.

    "abstract": "The trustworthiness of AI is considered essential to the adoption and\napplication of AI systems. However, the meaning of trust varies across\nindustry, research and policy spaces. Studies suggest that professionals who\ndevelop and use AI regard an AI system as trustworthy based on their personal\nexperiences and social relations at work. Studies about trust in AI and the\nconstructs that aim to operationalise trust in AI (e.g., consistency,\nreliability, explainability and accountability). However, the majority of\nexisting studies about trust in AI are situated in Western, Educated,\nIndustrialised, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. The few studies about\ntrust and AI in Africa do not include the views of people who develop, study or\nuse AI in their work. In this study, we surveyed 157 people with professional\nand/or educational interests in AI from 25 African countries, to explore how\nthey conceptualised trust in AI. Most respondents had links with workshops\nabout trust and AI in Africa in Namibia and Ghana. Respondents' educational\nbackground, transnational mobility, and country of origin influenced their\nconcerns about AI systems. These factors also affected their levels of distrust\nin certain AI applications and their emphasis on specific principles designed\nto foster trust. Respondents often expressed that their values are guided by\nthe communities in which they grew up and emphasised communal relations over\nindividual freedoms. They described trust in many ways, including applying\nnuances of Afro-relationalism to constructs in international discourse, such as\nreliability and reliance. Thus, our exploratory study motivates more empirical\nresearch about the ways trust is practically enacted and experienced in African\nsocial realities of AI design, use and governance.",

    "abstract": "The Cosmic Shoreline concept was introduced as a way to separate planets with\nand without atmosphere, based on the relationship between the cumulative\ninstellation and the escape velocity observed in the Solar System. The\nexoplanet community has tried to refine the way we understand the cosmic\nshoreline in order to provide a consistent tool for establishing the hierarchy\nfor exoplanet observations. This is particularly relevant when trying to unveil\nsmall exoplanet atmospheres with the JWST or the upcoming ELTs. Here, our goal\nis to use an empirical approach to refine the Cosmic Shoreline concept. In\nparticular, we used the data provided by the ExoAtmospheres database, using the\nlargest available sample of exoplanets with confirmed atmospheric detections.\nWe reconcile limitations in the classical shoreline definition by anchoring our\nEmpirical Cosmic Shoreline (ECS) to both Mars and the irradiated super-Earth 55\nCnc e. The resulting relation exhibits a significantly steeper slope than\npreviously theorized. Applied to planets orbiting M dwarfs, prime targets for\nhabitable-zone studies, the ECS suggests that a larger fraction retain\natmospheres than predicted by classical models when using standard Ixuv\nestimates. However, incorporating revised XUV fluence histories for low-mass M\ndwarfs (M< 0.35 Ms) reveals severe atmospheric vulnerability: only seven small\nplanets (R<1.7 Re) orbit securely within the retention zone of these stars. We\nfinally identify high-priority targets for the JWST Rocky Worlds survey and\nfuture ELT observations based on their ECS positioning and Transmission\nSpectroscopy Metrics. Future efforts must focus on expanding the empirical\nvalidations of the ECS, particularly through high-precision observations of\nborderline candidates and systems with well-constrained XUV histories.\n[Abridged]",

In the present work,\nthe CN 214Ra was deliberately selected to investigate the dependence of the\ntotal neutron multiplicity (Mtotal) on the proton number (Z), while keeping the\nneutron number constant at N = 126 in the pre-actinide region. The objective of\nthe study is two-fold : (i) to examine the effect of proton shell closure when\nmoving away from Z = 82, and (ii) to correlate the present results on proton\nshell closure with our previous finding on neutron shell closure. We have also\nused the previous reported data for N = 126 isotones 210Po, 212Rn, and 213Fr to\nestablish the validation of shell closure. A systematic increase in Mtotal with\nincreasing Z was observed from Z = 82 to Z = 88. Furthermore, comparison of the\npresent results on proton shell closure with our earlier neutron shell closure\nobservation, reveals that the cross-correlation between neutron and proton\nshell closure shows a systematic increase in Mtotal as one moves away from\n208Pb, whether along isotonic or isotopic chains.",

Specifically, we focus on whether transformer models employ something\nanalogous to a lexical store - where each word has an entry that contains\nsemantic information. To do this, we extracted the token embedding space of\nRoBERTa-base and k-means clustered it into 200 clusters. In our first study, we\nthen manually inspected the resultant clusters to consider whether they are\nsensitive to semantic information. In our second study, we tested whether the\nclusters are sensitive to five psycholinguistic measures: valence,\nconcreteness, iconicity, taboo, and age of acquisition. Overall, our findings\nwere very positive - there is a wide variety of semantic information encoded\nwithin the token embedding space. This serves to rule out certain \"meaning\neliminativist\" hypotheses about how transformer LLMs process semantic\ninformation.",

RoTO casts the defense objective\nas a min-max optimization problem that maximizes expected topological\ndistortion across this uncertainty set, without relying on perfect probe\ncontrol or specific attacker models. To approximate attacker behavior, RoTO\nleverages graph neural networks for inference simulation and adversarial\ntraining. We also derive an upper bound on attacker success probability, and\ndemonstrate that our approach enhances topology obfuscation performance through\nthe optimization of this upper bound. Experimental results show that RoTO\noutperforms existing defense methods, achieving average improvements of 34% in\nstructural similarity and 42.6% in link distance while maintaining strong\nrobustness and concealment capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have become a cornerstone for training and scaling\nlarge language models (LLMs), offering substantial gains in model capacity and\nefficiency through sparse expert activation. However, serving these models\nremains challenging in practice, particularly in resource-constrained edge\nenvironments, due to their large memory footprint and complex communication\ndemands. While centralized cloud inference is common, it incurs high\ninfrastructure costs, along with latency and privacy concerns. A few recent\nedge MoE works propose memory-efficient strategies but typically focus on\nsingle-device or homogeneous setups. This paper presents DanceMoE, an efficient\nMoE inference framework that enables activation-aware expert placement across\ncollaborative, heterogeneous, GPU-equipped edge servers. DanceMoE leverages the\ninherent sparsity of MoE models and workload locality to minimize cross-server\ncommunication and enable efficient expert placement under heterogeneous\nresource constraints. It introduces a data-driven, activation-aware placement\nalgorithm that balances local coverage and memory usage across servers,\nalongside a lightweight migration mechanism that adapts expert assignments\nunder evolving workloads. We evaluate DanceMoE on modern MoE models and widely\nused datasets, demonstrating up to 30.6\\% lower inference latency, and\nsubstantial communication reduction compared to state-of-the-art baselines,\nshowcasing the effectiveness of collaborative edge-based MoE inference.",

Simultaneously, $Y$ satisfies the bounded\nstatistical parity constraint $I(Y;S) \\leq \\epsilon$. To design $Y$, we use\nextended versions of the Functional Representation Lemma and the Strong\nFunctional Representation Lemma which are based on randomization techniques and\nstudy the tightness of the obtained bounds in special cases.

To\naddress this, we propose a Knowledge Distillation (KD) based training approach\nfor short context speaker embedding extraction from two speaker mixtures.

We study the feasibility of performing identity reassignment\nover blocks of fixed size, i.e., blockwise identity reassignment, to go towards\na low-latency speaker embedding based tracking system.

    "abstract": "With the rapid proliferation of streaming services, network load exhibits\nhighly time-varying and bursty behavior, posing serious challenges for\nmaintaining Quality of Service (QoS) in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms\n(CCPs). While CCPs leverage Predict-then-Schedule architecture to improve QoS\nand profitability, accurate load forecasting remains challenging under traffic\nsurges. Existing methods either minimize mean absolute error, resulting in\nunderprovisioning and potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during\npeak periods, or adopt conservative overprovisioning strategies, which mitigate\nSLA risks at the expense of increased resource expenditure. To address this\ndilemma, we propose HRS, a hybrid representation framework with scheduling\nawareness that integrates numerical and image-based representations to better\ncapture extreme load dynamics. We further introduce a Scheduling-Aware Loss\n(SAL) that captures the asymmetric impact of prediction errors, guiding\npredictions that better support scheduling decisions. Extensive experiments on\nfour real-world datasets demonstrate that HRS consistently outperforms ten\nbaselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing SLA violation\nrates by 63.1% and total profit loss by 32.3%.",

    "abstract": "This paper is devoted to studying two important classes of objects in\ntriangulated categories; silting objects and $d$-cluster tilting objects, and\ntheir correspondences. First, we introduce the notion of $d$-silting objects as\na generalization tilting objects whose endomorphism algebras have global\ndimension at most $d$. For a smooth dg algebra $A$ and its $(d+1)$-Calabi-Yau\ncompletion $\\Pi$, we show that the induction functor gives an embedding from\nthe poset $\\operatorname{silt}^dA$ of $d$-silting objects of $A$ to the poset\n$\\operatorname{silt}\\Pi$ of silting objects of $\\Pi$. Moreover, when $H^0\\Pi$\nis finite dimensional, this functor identifies the Hasse quiver of\n$\\operatorname{silt}^dA$ as a full subquiver of the Hasse quiver of\n$\\operatorname{silt}\\Pi$. In this case, we also prove that each $d$-silting\nobject $P$ of $A$ gives a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of\n$\\operatorname{per} A$ as the $\\nu[-d]$-orbit of $P$. Secondly, for a\nconnective Calabi-Yau dg algebra $\\Pi$, we study the map from\n$\\operatorname{silt}\\Pi$ to the set\n$d\\text{-}\\operatorname{ctilt}\\mathcal{C}(\\Pi)$ of $d$-cluster tilting objects\nin the cluster category $\\mathcal{C}(\\Pi)$. We call $\\Pi$\n$\\mathcal{F}$-liftable if the induced map\n$\\operatorname{silt}\\Pi\\cap\\mathcal{F}\\to\nd\\text{-}\\operatorname{ctilt}\\mathcal{C}(\\Pi)$ is bijective, where\n$\\mathcal{F}$ is the fundamental domain in $\\operatorname{per}\\Pi$. We prove\nthat $\\mathcal{F}$-liftable Calabi-Yau dg algebras $\\Pi$ such that $H^0\\Pi$ is\nhereditary are precisely the Calabi-Yau completions of hereditary algebras. As\nan application, we obtain counter-examples to an open question posed in [IYa1].\nWe also study Calabi-Yau dg algebras such that the map\n$\\operatorname{silt}\\Pi\\to d\\text{-}\\operatorname{ctilt}\\mathcal{C}(\\Pi)$ is\nsurjective, which we call liftable.

    "abstract": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), one of the most fundamental optimization\nalgorithms in machine learning (ML), can be recast through a continuous-time\napproximation as a Fokker-Planck equation for Langevin dynamics, a viewpoint\nthat has motivated many theoretical studies. Within this framework, we study\nthe relationship between the quasi-stationary distribution derived from this\nequation and the initial distribution through the Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence. As the quasi-steady-state distribution depends on the expected cost\nfunction, the KL divergence eventually reveals the connection between the\nexpected cost function and the initialization distribution. By applying this to\ndeep neural network models (DNNs), we can express the bounds of the expected\nloss function explicitly in terms of the initialization parameters. Then, by\nminimizing this bound, we obtain an optimal condition of the initialization\nvariance in the Gaussian case. This result provides a concrete mathematical\ncriterion, rather than a heuristic approach, to select the scale of weight\ninitialization in DNNs. In addition, we experimentally confirm our theoretical\nresults by using the classical SGD to train fully connected neural networks on\nthe MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The result shows that if the variance of\nthe initialization distribution satisfies our theoretical optimal condition,\nthen the corresponding DNN model always achieves lower final training loss and\nhigher test accuracy than the conventional He-normal initialization. Our work\nthus supplies a mathematically grounded indicator that guides the choice of\ninitialization variance and clarifies its physical meaning of the dynamics of\nparameters in DNNs.",

The mathematical models of active filaments appearing in the\nliterature typically involve combinations of follower-forces, compressive\ntangential forces, along the filament, and an opposite force on the fluid that\ngenerates an effective surface flow. In this paper, we present a comparative\ndynamical systems study of active filament models examining the differences in\ndynamic states that occur when actuation is through follower forces alone, or\nthe effect of surface flows is also included. We consider cases where actuation\nis applied only at the filament tip, or distributed uniformly along the\nfilament length. By varying actuation strength, we show that the first\nbifurcations that provide the transition between the upright, whirling and\nbeating states appear in all models. At higher values of actuation, when\nbeating becomes unstable, however, qualitative differences between the models\nemerge. Those with distributed actuation produce a single, time-dependent\nstate, which for the surface flow model is reminiscent of a rotating helix that\nperiodically changes handedness and rotation direction. Tip actuation, however,\nyields complex transitions that ultimately produce a chaotic state. We link the\ndifferences in dynamics between tip and distributed actuation to differences in\ntheir respective internal stress distributions, differences which appear as\nearly as the first bifurcation where they affect the shapes of the unstable\nmodes.",

Intra-abdominal pressure and abdominal wall dynamic undergo consistent\nand predictable interactions. However, this relationship is subject-specific\nand may not be extrapolated to other individuals.

Our results offer a microscopic explanation of\nthe critical temperature, $T_c$, as function of the twist angle where the\nlargest $T_c$ is found at $\\theta_{max}=1.1^\\circ$. For $\\theta>\\theta_{max}$,\n$T_c$ is obtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation of the Cooper channel. For\n$\\theta<\\theta_{max}$, the discussion is based on the critical line of the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition.",

Addressing this, the present\nstudy explores the integration of additive manufacturing with photocatalysis by\ndecorating Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ onto a 3D-printed hematite scaffold\n(Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$@3DH) for the degradation of cresols. The 3D-printed hematite\ngrid, fabricated via direct ink writing, exhibited excellent rheological\nbehavior ($\\tau\\gamma = 24$ Pa), allowing precise shape retention. The sintered\nBi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ was subsequently immobilized via a facile dip-coating method.\nUnder optimized conditions, the composite achieved 99.78\\% degradation of 20\nmg/L p-cresol within 240 min of irradiation. Notably, hematite served as a\nporous substrate and contributed to photocatalytic activity. Density functional\ntheory simulations with Hubbard correction (DFT+U) indicated an interfacial\ncharge transfer of approximately -0.9 electrons from hematite to\nBi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$, confirming a S-scheme heterojunction between hematite and\nBi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ semiconductors, validating experimental observations. The\ncomposite demonstrated strong performance across varied water matrices and in\nthe presence of other cresol isomers. It also retained 84.28\\% degradation\nefficiency after 10 cycles, with negligible catalyst leaching. Furthermore, in\nvitro and in silico ecotoxicity analyses revealed reduced toxicity of the\ndegradation products.

As quantum devices become more\nsophisticated, it is increasingly essential to rely not only on physics-based\nmodels, but also on predictive models with open-loop optimization. Therefore,\nwe choose the Graybox approach, which is composed of an explicit (whitebox)\nmodel describing the known dynamics and an implicit (blackbox) model describing\nthe noisy dynamics in the form of a deep neural network, to characterize and\ncalibrate superconducting-qubit devices. By sending a set of selected pulses to\nthe devices and measuring Pauli expectation values, the Graybox approach can\ntrain the implicit model and optimize gates based on specified loss functions.\nWe also benchmark our optimized gates on the devices and cross-testing\npredictive models with two types of loss functions, i.e., the mean squared\nerrors (MSE) of expectation values and the absolute errors (AE) of average gate\nfidelities (AGF). While the Graybox method allows for flexibility of the\nimplicit noise model, its construction relies on a finite measurement shots\ndataset. We thus apply the decomposition of expected MSE loss to show that the\nfinite-shot estimation of expectation values is the main contribution to the\nminimum value achievable of the expected MSE loss. We also show that the\nexpected loss is an upper bound of the expected absolute error of AGF between\nthe exact value and model prediction.

This paper presents a\nunified perspective by framing both classical and modern generative methods\nwithin the PLVM paradigm. We trace the progression from classical flat models\nsuch as probabilistic PCA, Gaussian mixture models, latent class analysis, item\nresponse theory, and latent Dirichlet allocation, through their sequential\nextensions including Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian HMMs, and Linear Dynamical\nSystems, to contemporary deep architectures: Variational Autoencoders as Deep\nPLVMs, Normalizing Flows as Tractable PLVMs, Diffusion Models as Sequential\nPLVMs, Autoregressive Models as Explicit Generative Models, and Generative\nAdversarial Networks as Implicit PLVMs. Viewing these architectures under a\ncommon probabilistic taxonomy reveals shared principles, distinct inference\nstrategies, and the representational trade-offs that shape their strengths.

    "abstract": "The proton and neutron make up over 99.9\\% of visible matter in the universe.\nThe internal structure of protons, governed by ElectroMagnetic Form Factors\n(EMFFs), has been probed in both space-like (SL) and time-like (TL) regions.\nThe BESIII experiment has achieved the most precise TL proton FF measurements\nto date, providing new insights into proton structure. However, higher-order\neffects in EMFFs, especially the impact of Two-Photon Exchange (TPE), remain\npoorly understood due to experimental challenges in $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation.\nIn this work, we analyze high-statistics BESIII data across a wide c.m. energy\nrange and observe, for the first time, a significant angular asymmetry\n(8.6$\\sigma$) in proton production. We demonstrate that this asymmetry arises\nfrom TPE, using a Born-like event selection, and extract the corresponding\nTPE-related EMFF properties. The observed interference between two-photon and\none-photon exchanges (OPE$\\otimes$TPE) is consistent with expectations at the\nlevel of the fine-structure constant relative to the OPE.",

Image generation is carried out through\nour newly introduced Next Visual Granularity (NVG) generation framework, which\ngenerates a visual granularity sequence beginning from an empty image and\nprogressively refines it, from global layout to fine details, in a structured\nmanner. This iterative process encodes a hierarchical, layered representation\nthat offers fine-grained control over the generation process across multiple\ngranularity levels. We train a series of NVG models for class-conditional image\ngeneration on the ImageNet dataset and observe clear scaling behavior. Compared\nto the VAR series, NVG consistently outperforms it in terms of FID scores (3.30\n-> 3.03, 2.57 ->2.44, 2.09 -> 2.06).

    "abstract": "This work presents a group-theoretic interpretation of the historical\nevolution of mechanics, proposing that each fundamental theory of motion\ncorresponds to a distinct geometry in the sense of Felix Klein. The character\nof each geometry is uniquely determined by its Inertia Group-the group of\nspacetime transformations that preserves its privileged class of inertial\nmotions. We trace the three major epistemological ruptures in the history of\nmechanics by translating foundational physical principles into the unambiguous\nlanguage of group theory. The analysis begins with Aristotelian mechanics,\nwhere absolute Space and Time are shown to be homogeneous spaces of the Group\nof Aristotle, defined by its preservation of rest. The second rupture, driven\nby the relativity of motion (Bruno, Galileo), leads to the abandonment of\nabsolute Space and the construction of the Galilean Group, which preserves the\nclass of uniform rectilinear motions. The final rupture, precipitated by the\ncrisis in electromagnetism, results in the dissolution of absolute Time and the\nemergence of the Poincar\\'e Group, preserving affine lines and the Minkowski\nmetric. Central results of this approach are theorems demonstrating, with\nmathematical certainty, the non-existence of a Galilean-invariant \"Space\" and a\nPoincar\\'e-invariant \"Time,\" where invariance is defined with respect to the\naction of the corresponding inertia group. This geometric framework provides a\nunified perspective on the transition from classical to modern physics and\nallows for a rigorous distinction between 'primary' epistemological ruptures,\nwhich alter the Inertia Group itself, and 'secondary' ruptures, which introduce\nnew formalisms for the management of dynamics within a stable geometry.",

First, the Network\nwith Object-Imaging Module (NOIM) precisely delineates target structures from\ndegraded inputs while actively suppressing background interference.\nSubsequently, the Structural Recovery Module (SRM) employs multi-scale dilated\nconvolutions and feature pyramid fusion to complete shape reconstruction from\npreliminary imaging. Finally, the Global Detail Refinement Module (GDRM)\nutilizes sub-pixel convolution with skip connections to map structural priors\ninto high-fidelity RGB outputs. We design a triple-branch hybrid loss (weighted\nreconstruction, perceptual, and stylistic components) alongside a phased\ntraining strategy to enforce structural coherence, semantic consistency, and\nvisual stylization. Experimental validation demonstrates competitive\nperformance against state-of-the-art inpainting models across metrics including\nSSIM (0.978), PSNR (33.86 dB), MAE (1.605), and LPIPS (0.018), while\nmaintaining robustness in extreme scenarios (low illumination, high noise,\nmulti-object occlusion, motion blur).

    "abstract": "Association schemes are central objects in algebraic combinatorics, with the\nclassical schemes lying at their core. These classical association schemes\nessentially consist of the Hamming and Johnson schemes, and their $q$-analogs:\nbilinear forms scheme, alternating bilinear forms scheme, Hermitian forms\nscheme, $q$-Johnson scheme, and polar space schemes. Each of them gives rise to\na distance-regular graph on a vertex set $X$, naturally endowed with the path\nmetric. We study $d$-codes in these schemes, that is, subsets $Y$ of $X$ in\nwhich every pair of distinct elements has path distance at least $d$. A\npowerful tool for deriving upper bounds on the size of $d$-codes is the linear\nprogramming method. In the case of the Hamming and Johnson schemes, the linear\nprogram has been studied since the 1970s, but its optimum is still unknown. We\ndetermine the optimum of the linear program for nearly all classical\nassociation schemes distinct from the Hamming and Johnson schemes. This is\nachieved by constructing feasible solutions to both the primal and dual linear\nprograms whose objective values coincide. As a corollary, we obtain upper\nbounds on $t$-intersecting sets in classical association schemes, providing new\nproofs of several known results and, in particular, improving earlier bounds on\n$t$-intersecting sets of generators in polar spaces. These results can be\nviewed as analogs of the classical Erd\\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem in extremal set\ntheory.

Logics that lack the\nCIP are regarded as `pathological' and excluded from consideration. In this\nchapter, we survey variations and generalisations of traditional Craig\ninterpolation. First, we consider Craig interpolants for implications in logics\nwithout the CIP, focusing on the decidability and complexity of deciding their\nexistence. We then generalise interpolation by looking for Craig interpolants\nin languages L' that can be weaker than the language L of the given\nimplication. Thus, do not only we restrict the non-logical symbols of Craig\ninterpolants but also the logical ones. The resulting L/L'-interpolation\nproblem generalises L/L'-definability, the question whether an L-formula is\nequivalent to some L'-formula. After that, we move from logical languages to\nformal languages where interpolation disguises itself as separation: given two\ndisjoint languages in a class C, does there exist a separating language in a\nsmaller class C'? This question is particularly well-studied in the case when\nthe input languages are regular and the separating language is first-order\ndefinable. Finally, we connect the different research strands by showing how\nthe decidability of the separation problem for regular languages can be used to\nprove the decidability of Craig interpolant existence for linear temporal logic\nLTL.",

We present the first comprehensive\ncausal study of this phenomenon by analyzing and directly intervening in the\ninternal representation geometry of large language models (LLMs). Our key\ncontribution is an online variational probing framework that continuously\nestimates the subspace of the standard variety during fine-tuning, enabling\nprojection-based decoupling from this space.

These results provide causal\nevidence that subspace dominance by high-resource varieties can restrict\ngenerative capacity for related varieties.

Recent advancements in agentic deep research empower LLMs to\nautonomously reason, search, and synthesize information. However, current\napproaches relying on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) face critical\nissues such as conflicting gradients and reward sparsity, limiting performance\ngains and training efficiency. To address these, we first propose Atomic\nThought, a novel LLM thinking paradigm that decomposes reasoning into\nfine-grained functional units. These units are supervised by Reasoning Reward\nModels (RRMs), which provide Atomic Thought Rewards (ATR) for fine-grained\nguidance. Building on this, we propose Atom-Searcher, a novel RL framework for\nagentic deep research that integrates Atomic Thought and ATR. Atom-Searcher\nuses a curriculum-inspired reward schedule, prioritizing process-level ATR\nearly and transitioning to outcome rewards, accelerating convergence on\neffective reasoning paths. Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent\nimprovements over the state-of-the-art. Key advantages include: (1)\nAtom-Searcher scales computation at test-time. (2) Atomic Thought provides\nsupervision anchors for RRMs, bridging deep research tasks and RRMs. (3)\nAtom-Searcher exhibits more interpretable, human-like reasoning patterns.",

The\nthermonuclear burst detected with NICER shows clear evidence of a photospheric\nradius expansion (PRE) event and a distinct feature in the burst profile. The\nburst profiles demonstrate significant energy dependence, with the hardness\nratio varying notably during the PRE phase. The radius of the neutron star\nphotosphere expanded to a maximum of $23.1_{-3.2}^{+3.8}$ km while its\ntemperature reached a minimum of 1.4 keV. The time-resolved burst spectra can\nbe modeled using variable persistent emission method, indicating that the soft\nexcess may arise from enhanced mass accretion onto the neutron star,\npotentially due to the Poynting-Robertson drag. Alternatively, the disk\nreflection model can be used to explain the soft excess emission during a\nburst. The time-resolved spectral study is performed for three thermonuclear\nbursts detected with XMM-Newton. The XMM-Newton time-resolved burst spectra can\nbe modeled using an absorbed blackbody model, without any signatures of the\nPRE. We conduct a detailed spectral analysis of the 2025 NuSTAR observation of\n4U 1702-429, revealing a broad iron line at 6.4 keV and a Compton hump around\n20 keV, indicating X-ray reflection features.

On\nthe other hand, the hierarchical model predicts that star formation happens at\na range of scales and densities, where open clusters (OCs) only emerge from the\ndensest regions. We aim to exploit a recent catalog of compact OCs, corrected\nfor completeness, to obtain an updated estimation of the surface density star\nformation rate within OCs ($\\sum_{\\rm SFR,OC}$), which we compare with recent\nestimates of $\\sum_{\\rm SFR}$ to determine which model is more likely. We have\napplied two methods. The first one consisted of integrating over the power law\nthat was fit for the mass function of the youngest OCs using a MC sampling. The\nsecond one consisted of counting the total compact mass within these youngest\nOCs within 1 kpc, so that the result could be directly compared with local\nvalues of $\\sum_{\\rm SFR}$. We estimated new $\\sum_{\\rm SFR,OC}$ values between\n$736^{+159}_{-176}$ and $875^{+34}_{-35}$ M$_{\\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$,\ndepending on the methodology. These results are significantly higher than\nprevious $\\sum_{\\rm SFR,OC}$ estimates, which we attribute to the\nincompleteness of past catalogs, and are consistent with the majority ($\\geq$\n50 \\%) or even the vast majority ($\\geq$ 80 \\%) of the star formation occurring\nin initially compact clusters, through comparisons with $\\sum_{\\rm SFR}$ from\nthe recent literature. Our new $\\sum_{\\rm SFR,OC}$ values are consistent with\nclustered formation being the most dominant mode of star formation.",

However, deep transformer models\noften suffer from an over-smoothing issue, in which token representations\nconverge to similar values as they pass through successive transformer blocks.\nIn this paper, we establish an equivalence between the hidden-state dynamics\ninduced by stacked attention layers and graph neural diffusion on a complete\ngraph. From this perspective, over-smoothing can be interpreted as a\nconsequence of the dissipative nature of the underlying diffusion dynamics.\nMotivated by this physical interpretation, we propose Wavy Transformer, which\nconsists of a novel attention layer based on second-order wavy dynamics. We\nalso introduce a feed-forward network and a normalization layer designed to\npreserve the physical state-velocity relationship under the chain rule, thereby\nextending the transformer architecture. We further validate our proposed\ntechniques on various transformer models for NLP and CV tasks.

Furthermore, they tend to entangle\ncontent and style in undesired ways. To address this, we propose leveraging\nmultiple style images which helps better represent style features and prevent\ncontent leaking from the style images. We design a method that leverages both\nimage prompt adapters and statistical alignment of the features during the\ndenoising process. With this, our approach is designed such that it can\nintervene both at the cross-attention and the self-attention layers of the\ndenoising UNet.

Tasks challenge models to formulate strategic\nplans, efficiently gather resources, master necessary skills, craft equipment,\nand defeat adversaries, reflecting practical scenarios' layered dependencies\nand constraints. Our extensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning\nboth open-source and proprietary models, including the GPT-5 family, reveals\nsubstantial performance disparities rarely observed in conventional reasoning\nbenchmarks. Detailed error analysis further uncovers specific weaknesses in\ncurrent models' abilities to generate robust high-level plans and reliably\nexecute structured actions.

Accurate species identification\nis crucial for studying pathosystem interactions, implementing quarantine\nmeasures, and developing control strategies. This study revisited the\nclassification of Brevipalpus based on phylogenetic relationships, identifying\ncryptic species and determining genetic distance boundaries. A multi-tool\nexploration of DNA datasets, including mitochondrial (two COI regions) and\nnuclear (ITS2 and D1-D3) data combined with a detailed morphological study\nusing light and scanning microscopy, was performed. Specimens were collected\nfrom 20 host plant families from South America, Europe, and the Middle East.\nSpecies were discriminated using three different approaches, namely, Automatic\nBarcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), Assemble Species by Automatic Partition (ASAP),\nand a local regression to establish consistent genetic distance thresholds.\nResults indicate that the current species-group classification only partially\nmatches that based on genetic lineages. Some species currently classified as\nbelonging to the phoenicis and cuneatus species groups were found to be\npolyphyletic and related to species placed in other species groups. A\nrearrangement of the species groups to align with the observed genetic lineages\nis proposed, and phylogenetically informative morphological traits are defined.\nCryptic diversity in certain taxa was consistently confirmed by various\nmethods. Nuclear and mitochondrial markers were essential for identifying\ncandidate lineages when morphology alone was insufficient. Nuclear markers\ndetected host-associated lineages within certain species. Inconsistencies\nbetween markers and methods suggest the presence of ongoing speciation\nprocesses, and hypotheses about speciation events were explored. Intra- and\ninterspecific genetic distances and threshold values were determined for the\nfour studied genomic fragments and can be used for routine taxonomic\nidentification and uncovering cryptic lineages.

    "abstract": "In the swiftly evolving domain of cloud computing, the advent of serverless\nsystems underscores the crucial need for predictive auto-scaling systems. This\nnecessity arises to ensure optimal resource allocation and maintain operational\nefficiency in inherently volatile environments. At the core of a predictive\nauto-scaling system is the workload forecasting model. Existing forecasting\nmodels struggle to quickly adapt to the dynamics in online workload streams and\nhave difficulty capturing the complex periodicity brought by fine-grained,\nhigh-frequency forecasting tasks. Addressing this, we propose a novel online\nensemble model, E3Former, for online workload forecasting in large-scale\npredictive auto-scaling. Our model synergizes the predictive capabilities of\nmultiple subnetworks to surmount the limitations of single-model approaches,\nthus ensuring superior accuracy and robustness. Remarkably, it accomplishes\nthis with a minimal increase in computational overhead, adhering to the lean\noperational ethos of serverless systems. Through extensive experimentation on\nreal-world workload datasets, we establish the efficacy of our ensemble model.\nIn online forecasting tasks, the proposed method reduces forecast error by an\naverage of 10%, and its effectiveness is further demonstrated through a\npredictive auto-scaling test in the real-life online system. Currently, our\nmethod has been deployed within ByteDance's Intelligent Horizontal Pod\nAuto-scaling (IHPA) platform, which supports the stable operation of over 30\napplications, such as Douyin E-Comerce, TouTiao, and Volcano Engine. The\npredictive auto-scaling capacity reaching over 600,000 CPU cores. On the basis\nof essentially ensuring service quality, the predictive auto-scaling system can\nreduce resource utilization by over 40%.",

Here, by ``supercritical\" we mean that the mean semigroup of $X$\nexhibits a Perron-Frobenius type behaviour with a positive principal\neigenvalue. In this paper, we study the almost sure behaviour of a family of\nmartingales naturally associated with the real or complex-valued eigenpairs of\nthe mean semigroup. Under a fourth-moment condition, we establish limit\ntheorems of the iterated logarithm type for these martingales. In particular,\nwe discover three regimes, each resulting in different scaling factors and\nlimits. Furthermore, we obtain a law of the iterated logarithm for the linear\nfunctional $\\langle \\mathrm{Re}(f),X_{t}\\rangle$ where $f$ is a sum of finite\nterms of eigenfunctions and $\\mathrm{Re}(f)$ denotes its real part.

While chiral charge and structural orders have been extensively\nstudied, chiral magnetic order -- particularly in altermagnets (AMs) -- remains\nlargely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the experimentally\nwell-characterized three-dimensional metal-organic framework K[Co(HCOO)$_3$]\nrepresents the first realization of a chiral second-order topological insulator\nwith altermagnetic order. This system hosts $\\emph{g}$-wave spin-split bands,\ncontrollable second-order topological states, and chirality-locked anomalous\ntransport properties. Its second-order topological phase manifests as\nalternating spin-up and spin-down hinge modes along the boundaries of hexagonal\nnanotubes. Remarkably, these spin-polarized hinge states can be switched\nthrough lattice chiral inversion. Simultaneously, the anomalous Hall effect and\nmagneto-optical effects exhibit reversed signs in left/right-handed\nenantiomers, substantiating a universal chirality-controlled response across\nboth electronic and optical channels.

However, a critical challenge remains: the\nsemantic mismatch between natural language questions (NLQs) and their\ncorresponding SQL queries. This issue is exacerbated in large-scale databases,\nwhere semantically similar attributes hinder schema linking and semantic drift\nduring SQL generation, ultimately reducing model accuracy. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce CRED-SQL, a framework designed for large-scale\ndatabases that integrates Cluster Retrieval and Execution Description. CRED-SQL\nfirst performs cluster-based large-scale schema retrieval to pinpoint the\ntables and columns most relevant to a given NLQ, alleviating schema mismatch.\nIt then introduces an intermediate natural language representation-Execution\nDescription Language (EDL)-to bridge the gap between NLQs and SQL. This\nreformulation decomposes the task into two stages: Text-to-EDL and EDL-to-SQL,\nleveraging LLMs' strong general reasoning capabilities while reducing semantic\ndeviation. Extensive experiments on two large-scale, cross-domain\nbenchmarks-SpiderUnion and BirdUnion-demonstrate that CRED-SQL achieves new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating its effectiveness and\nscalability.

    "abstract": "Labeling Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe) semiconductor images is challenging\ndue to the low-contrast defect boundaries, necessitating annotators to\ncross-reference multiple views. These views share a single ground truth (GT),\nforming a unique ``many-to-one'' relationship. This characteristic renders\nadvanced semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) methods suboptimal, as\nthey are generally limited by a ``one-to-one'' relationship, where each image\nis independently associated with its GT. Such limitation may lead to error\naccumulation in low-contrast regions, further exacerbating confirmation bias.\nTo address this issue, we revisit the SSS pipeline from a group-oriented\nperspective and propose a human-inspired solution: the Intra-group Consistency\nAugmentation Framework (ICAF). First, we experimentally validate the inherent\nconsistency constraints within CdZnTe groups, establishing a group-oriented\nbaseline using the Intra-group View Sampling (IVS). Building on this insight,\nwe introduce the Pseudo-label Correction Network (PCN) to enhance consistency\nrepresentation, which consists of two key modules. The View Augmentation Module\n(VAM) improves boundary details by dynamically synthesizing a boundary-aware\nview through the aggregation of multiple views. In the View Correction Module\n(VCM), this synthesized view is paired with other views for information\ninteraction, effectively emphasizing salient regions while minimizing noise.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for CdZnTe\nmaterials. Leveraging DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet-101 backbone as our segmentation\nmodel, we achieve a 70.6\\% mIoU on the CdZnTe dataset using only 2\ngroup-annotated data (5\\textperthousand).

    "abstract": "The recent rise in popularity of large language models (LLMs) has prompted\nconsiderable concerns about their moral capabilities. Although considerable\neffort has been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral values, existing\nbenchmarks and evaluations remain largely superficial, typically measuring\nalignment based on final ethical verdicts rather than explicit moral reasoning.\nIn response, this paper aims to advance the investigation of LLMs' moral\ncapabilities by examining their capacity to function as Artificial Moral\nAssistants (AMAs), systems envisioned in the philosophical literature to\nsupport human moral deliberation. We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires\nmore than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only\nmust AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also\nbe able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values\noutside of those embedded in the alignment phase. Building on existing\nphilosophical literature, we begin by designing a new formal framework of the\nspecific kind of behaviour an AMA should exhibit, individuating key qualities\nsuch as deductive and abductive moral reasoning. Drawing on this theoretical\nframework, we develop a benchmark to test these qualities and evaluate popular\nopen LLMs against it. Our results reveal considerable variability across models\nand highlight persistent shortcomings, particularly regarding abductive moral\nreasoning. Our work connects theoretical philosophy with practical AI\nevaluation while also emphasising the need for dedicated strategies to\nexplicitly enhance moral reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Code available at\nhttps://github.com/alessioGalatolo/AMAeval",

While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers\nrobustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing\napproaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in\nprivacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated\nlearning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of\neight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five\nparticipants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal\nbackbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under\nfour paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated\naveraging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the\nglobal test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4\npercentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain.\nOn an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by\n+52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that\nFL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user\ngeneralization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable,\nprivacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.",

Time-varying materials\nexchange energy with the waves passing through them, thus exhibiting entirely\nnew phenomena not possible with static media. Work to date has largely\nconsidered the realisation of ultrafast time-varying materials, with much less\nattention paid to how their interaction depends upon the shape of the incident\nwaves themselves. Here we experimentally demonstrate 'waveform shaping' within\nultrafast time-varying media: temporal shaping of incident pulses to optimise\nspecific dynamic material interactions. We create an ultrafast time-varying\nmedium by rapidly modulating a waveguide termination, and measure the\nspectrally resolved reflection matrix. Analysis of this reflection matrix\nenables the identification of the incident waveforms that undergo a desired\nspectral transformation. Using this approach, we first characterise the\nmedium's eigenpulses; temporal modes that reflect from the medium without\nspectral distortion. Next, we identify the waveforms that are either maximally\nor minimally reflected, enabling strong broadband absorption arising from the\ntemporal modulation of the medium. Finally, we show how energy can be optimally\nconcentrated into a user-defined set of frequency bands upon reflection.

Such support is particularly valuable for the challenging experiments\non heavy, unstable, and superheavy elements and for precision measurements\naimed at testing the Standard Model of particle physics. To be reliable and\nuseful in experimental context, theoretical predictions should be based on\nhigh-accuracy calculations. For heavy elements, such calculations must treat\nboth relativistic effects and electron correlation on the highest possible\nlevel. Relativistic coupled cluster is considered one of the most powerful\nmethods for accurate calculations on heavy many-electron atoms and molecules.\nThis approach is highly accurate and versatile and can be used to obtain\nenergies and a variety of atomic and molecular properties.

    "abstract": "Image set classification (ISC), which can be viewed as a task of comparing\nsimilarities between sets consisting of unordered heterogeneous images with\nvariable quantities and qualities, has attracted growing research attention in\nrecent years. How to learn effective feature representations and how to explore\nthe similarities between different image sets are two key yet challenging\nissues in this field. However, existing traditional ISC methods classify image\nsets based on raw pixel features, ignoring the importance of feature learning.\nExisting deep ISC methods can learn deep features, but they fail to adaptively\nadjust the features when measuring set distances, resulting in limited\nperformance in few-shot ISC. To address the above issues, this paper combines\ntraditional ISC methods with deep models and proposes a novel few-shot ISC\napproach called Deep Class-specific Collaborative Representation (DCSCR)\nnetwork to simultaneously learn the frame- and concept-level feature\nrepresentations of each image set and the distance similarities between\ndifferent sets. Specifically, DCSCR consists of a fully convolutional deep\nfeature extractor module, a global feature learning module, and a\nclass-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module. The\ndeep feature extractor and global feature learning modules are used to learn\n(local and global) frame-level feature representations, while the\nclass-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module is\nexploit to adaptively learn the concept-level feature representation of each\nimage set and thus obtain the distance similarities between different sets by\ndeveloping a new CSCR-based contrastive loss function. Extensive experiments on\nseveral well-known few-shot ISC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method compared with some state-of-the-art image set classification\nalgorithms.",

    "abstract": "During the fabrication of heterogeneous structures inside chips, impurities\nand defects are inevitably introduced. However, the mechanism by which defects\naffect interfacial heat transport remains unclear. In this work, a microscale\nthermal transport model is developed by combining first-principles calculations\nwith Monte Carlo simulations, explicitly accounting for the effects of defects.\nThe effects of defect concentration and location on thermal transport\ncharacteristics are investigated for four heterointerfaces: Si/SiC, GaN/SiC,\nSi/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond. Temperature distribution, spectral thermal\nconductance, average phonon scattering numbers, and interfacial thermal\nconductance (ITC) are compared under different conditions. The results show\nthat, for Si/SiC, Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond interfaces, introducing defects\nweakens heat transport. Higher defect concentration leads to lower ITC.\nFurthermore, when defects are in SiC or Diamond, which have broader phonon\nspectral distributions, their impact on ITC is weaker. For the GaN/SiC\ninterface, defects in GaN reduce ITC, while defects in SiC enhance ITC. At a\ndefect concentration of 0.05, ITC decreases by 54.1% when defects are present\nin GaN, but increases by 57.2% when defects are present in SiC. This behavior\narises from defect-induced phonon energy redistribution near the interface. The\nredistribution increases the population of low-frequency phonons, which are\nmore capable of crossing the interface, thus enhancing heat transfer. This\nstudy enriches the fundamental understanding of thermal transport across\nsemiconductor heterointerfaces and guides the design and fabrication of\nhigh-ITC heterostructures.",

This paper presents\nFedSODA, a resource-efficient FFT framework that enables clients to adapt LLMs\nwithout accessing or storing the full model. Specifically, we first propose a\nsimilarity group pruning (SGP) module, which prunes redundant layers from the\nfull LLM while retaining the most critical layers to preserve the model\nperformance.

We conduct extensive experiments on three open-source\nLLMs across a variety of downstream tasks.

Our findings suggest a novel approach for engineering nonlinear\nchiral responses in metasurfaces, complementing traditional approaches and\npaving the way towards advanced chiral metadevices.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale text-to-image generative models have shown remarkable ability to\nsynthesize diverse and high-quality images. However, it is still challenging to\ndirectly apply these models for editing real images for two reasons. First, it\nis difficult for users to come up with a perfect text prompt that accurately\ndescribes every visual detail in the input image. Second, while existing models\ncan introduce desirable changes in certain regions, they often dramatically\nalter the input content and introduce unexpected changes in unwanted regions.\nTo address these challenges, we present Dual Contrastive Denoising Score, a\nsimple yet powerful framework that leverages the rich generative prior of\ntext-to-image diffusion models. Inspired by contrastive learning approaches for\nunpaired image-to-image translation, we introduce a straightforward dual\ncontrastive loss within the proposed framework. Our approach utilizes the\nextensive spatial information from the intermediate representations of the\nself-attention layers in latent diffusion models without depending on auxiliary\nnetworks. Our method achieves both flexible content modification and structure\npreservation between input and output images, as well as zero-shot\nimage-to-image translation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our\napproach outperforms existing methods in real image editing while maintaining\nthe capability to directly utilize pretrained text-to-image diffusion models\nwithout further training.",

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)\nhave enabled recent progress in multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), the\nrise of generative AI (GenAI) tools introduces a new challenge: GenAI-driven\nnews diversity, characterized by highly varied and complex content. We show\nthat this diversity induces multi-level drift, comprising (1) model-level\nmisperception drift, where stylistic variations disrupt a model's internal\nreasoning, and (2) evidence-level drift, where expression diversity degrades\nthe quality or relevance of retrieved external evidence. These drifts\nsignificantly degrade the robustness of current LVLM-based MMD systems. To\nsystematically study this problem, we introduce DriftBench, a large-scale\nbenchmark comprising 16,000 news instances across six categories of\ndiversification. We design three evaluation tasks: (1) robustness of truth\nverification under multi-level drift; (2) susceptibility to adversarial\nevidence contamination generated by GenAI; and (3) analysis of reasoning\nconsistency across diverse inputs. Experiments with six state-of-the-art\nLVLM-based detectors show substantial performance drops (average F1 -14.8%) and\nincreasingly unstable reasoning traces, with even more severe failures under\nadversarial evidence injection.

    "abstract": "In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive\nlanguage, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While\nthe literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed\nresults for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand\nlanguage on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social\nmedia conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online\nexperiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has\na detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such\nexchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a\nbrand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as\nface-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a\ndirective way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a\nconversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the\nconversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect\nmore freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,\ndirective language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,\nthe strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study\ncontributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer\ninteractions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive\ncommunication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.",

Most diffusion-based recommendation models typically\nutilize standard Gaussian noise in symmetric forward and reverse processes in\ncontinuous data space. Nevertheless, the samples derived from recommendation\nsystems inhabit a discrete data space, which is fundamentally different from\nthe continuous one.

In the serving stage, the raw sample with missing\nfeatures is regarded as a noisy input to generate a denoising and robust\nrepresentation for the final prediction.

    "abstract": "Unidirectional modes in magnetically biased electromagnetic systems have long\nbeen associated with a thermodynamic paradox: the absence of\ncounter-propagating channels may produce field \"hotspots\" that can act as\nunphysical sinks of thermal radiation. Here we revisit this problem and show\nthat, surprisingly, material dissipation alone cannot fully regularize the\nsingular behavior of the normal modes of a nonreciprocal cavity. We demonstrate\nthat the paradox is resolved by nonlocal effects, which suppress the material\nresponse at short wavelengths and eliminate field singularities altogether. Our\nanalysis reveals a fundamental link between nonlocality, topology, and\nthermodynamic consistency, showing that real-space singularities and\nill-defined topologies go hand in hand, even in strongly dissipative platforms.\nThese findings clarify the physical origin of the paradox and establish\nnonlocality as a natural and robust mechanism for its resolution, opening new\navenues to explore the intertwined roles of topology and nonlocality in passive\nnonreciprocal photonics.",

According to the\nunknown samples, we first freeze the feature extraction layers and then only\nretrain the classification layer, which achieves excellent recognition\nperformance both in closed-set and open-set recognitions. We analyze the\ncomputational complexity of the proposed model. Experiments are conducted with\na large-scale UAV open dataset. The results show that the proposed Open-RFNet\noutperforms the existing benchmark methods in terms of recognition accuracy\nbetween the known and the unknown UAVs, as it achieves 95.12% in closed-set and\n96.08% in open-set under 25 UAV types, respectively.",

To address this, we\npropose a Bayesian Double Machine Learning (BDML) method, which modifies a\nstandard Bayesian multivariate regression model and recovers the causal effect\nof interest from the reduced-form covariance matrix. Our BDML is related to the\nburgeoning frequentist literature on DML while addressing its limitations in\nfinite-sample inference. Moreover, the BDML is based on a fully generative\nprobability model in the DML context, adhering to the likelihood principle. We\nshow that in high dimensional setups the naive estimator implicitly assumes no\nselection on observables--unlike our BDML. The BDML exhibits lower asymptotic\nbias and achieves asymptotic normality and semiparametric efficiency as\nestablished by a Bernstein-von Mises theorem, thereby ensuring robustness to\nmisspecification. In simulations, our BDML achieves lower RMSE, better\nfrequentist coverage, and shorter confidence interval width than alternatives\nfrom the literature, both Bayesian and frequentist.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical multi-agent systems (HMAS) organize collections of agents into\nlayered structures that help manage complexity and scale. These hierarchies can\nsimplify coordination, but they also can introduce trade-offs that are not\nalways obvious. This paper proposes a multi-dimensional taxonomy for HMAS along\nfive axes: control hierarchy, information flow, role and task delegation,\ntemporal layering, and communication structure. The intent is not to prescribe\na single \"best\" design but to provide a lens for comparing different\napproaches.\n  Rather than treating these dimensions in isolation, the taxonomy is connected\nto concrete coordination mechanisms - from the long-standing contract-net\nprotocol for task allocation to more recent work in hierarchical reinforcement\nlearning. Industrial contexts illustrate the framework, including power grids\nand oilfield operations, where agents at production, maintenance, and supply\nlevels coordinate to diagnose well issues or balance energy demand. These cases\nsuggest that hierarchical structures may achieve global efficiency while\npreserving local autonomy, though the balance is delicate.\n  The paper closes by identifying open challenges: making hierarchical\ndecisions explainable to human operators, scaling to very large agent\npopulations, and assessing whether learning-based agents such as large language\nmodels can be safely integrated into layered frameworks. This paper presents\nwhat appears to be the first taxonomy that unifies structural, temporal, and\ncommunication dimensions of hierarchical MAS into a single design framework,\nbridging classical coordination mechanisms with modern reinforcement learning\nand large language model agents.",

However, the long propagation delay and limited network capacity of\nunderwater communication networks (UCN) negatively impact the service quality\nof SAGAIN. To address this issue, this paper presents U-HPNF, a hierarchical\nframework designed to achieve a high-performance network with self-management,\nself-configuration, and self-optimization capabilities. U-HPNF leverages the\nsensing and decision-making capabilities of deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nto manage limited resources in UCNs, including communication bandwidth,\ncomputational resources, and energy supplies. Additionally, we incorporate\nfederated learning (FL) to iteratively optimize the decision-making model,\nthereby reducing communication overhead and protecting the privacy of node\nobservation information. By deploying digital twins (DT) at both the\nintelligent sink layer and aggregation layer, U-HPNF can mimic numerous network\nscenarios and adapt to varying network QoS requirements. Through a three-tier\nnetwork design with two-levels DT, U-HPNF provides an AI-native\nhigh-performance underwater network. Numerical results demonstrate that the\nproposed U-HPNF framework can effectively optimize network performance across\nvarious situations and adapt to changing QoS requirements.",

However, various changing factors -\nbeyond the RFF itself - can be entangled from signal transmission to reception,\nreducing the effectiveness of RFF Identification (RFFI). Existing RFFI methods\nmainly rely on domain adaptation techniques, which often lack explicit factor\nrepresentations, resulting in less robustness and limited controllability for\ndownstream tasks. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Disentangled\nRepresentation Learning (DRL) framework that learns explicit and independent\nrepresentations of multiple factors, including the RFF. Our framework\nintroduces modules for disentanglement, guided by the principles of\nexplicitness, modularity, and compactness. We design two dedicated modules for\nfactor classification and signal reconstruction, each with tailored loss\nfunctions that encourage effective disentanglement and enhance support for\ndownstream tasks. Thus, the framework can extract a set of interpretable\nvectors that explicitly represent corresponding factors. We evaluate our\napproach on two public benchmark datasets and a self-collected dataset. Our\nmethod achieves impressive performance on multiple DRL metrics. We also analyze\nthe effectiveness of our method on downstream RFFI task and conditional signal\ngeneration task. All modules of the framework contribute to improved\nclassification accuracy, and enable precise control over conditional generated\nsignals.

However,\nexisting LLM-based simulators for RSs face two major limitations: (1) static\nand single-step prompt-based inference that leads to inaccurate and incomplete\nuser profile construction; (2) unrealistic and single-round\nrecommendation-feedback interaction pattern that fails to capture real-world\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DGDPO (Diagnostic-Guided\nDynamic Profile Optimization), a novel framework that constructs user profile\nthrough a dynamic and iterative optimization process to enhance the simulation\nfidelity. Specifically, DGDPO incorporates two core modules within each\noptimization loop: firstly, a specialized LLM-based diagnostic module,\ncalibrated through our novel training strategy, accurately identifies specific\ndefects in the user profile. Subsequently, a generalized LLM-based treatment\nmodule analyzes the diagnosed defect and generates targeted suggestions to\nrefine the profile. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM-based user simulators that\nare limited to single-round interactions, we are the first to integrate DGDPO\nwith sequential recommenders, enabling a bidirectional evolution where user\nprofiles and recommendation strategies adapt to each other over multi-round\ninteractions. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "3D reconstruction of dynamic crowds in large scenes has become increasingly\nimportant for applications such as city surveillance and crowd analysis.\nHowever, current works attempt to reconstruct 3D crowds from a static image,\ncausing a lack of temporal consistency and inability to alleviate the typical\nimpact caused by occlusions. In this paper, we propose DyCrowd, the first\nframework for spatio-temporally consistent 3D reconstruction of hundreds of\nindividuals' poses, positions and shapes from a large-scene video. We design a\ncoarse-to-fine group-guided motion optimization strategy for occlusion-robust\ncrowd reconstruction in large scenes. To address temporal instability and\nsevere occlusions, we further incorporate a VAE (Variational Autoencoder)-based\nhuman motion prior along with a segment-level group-guided optimization. The\ncore of our strategy leverages collective crowd behavior to address long-term\ndynamic occlusions. By jointly optimizing the motion sequences of individuals\nwith similar motion segments and combining this with the proposed Asynchronous\nMotion Consistency (AMC) loss, we enable high-quality unoccluded motion\nsegments to guide the motion recovery of occluded ones, ensuring robust and\nplausible motion recovery even in the presence of temporal desynchronization\nand rhythmic inconsistencies. Additionally, in order to fill the gap of no\nexisting well-annotated large-scene video dataset, we contribute a virtual\nbenchmark dataset, VirtualCrowd, for evaluating dynamic crowd reconstruction\nfrom large-scene videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance in the large-scene dynamic crowd\nreconstruction task.

As a fundamental\nprinciple, an ideal CTTA method should rapidly adapt to new domains\n(exploration) while retaining and exploiting knowledge from previously\nencountered domains to handle similar domains in the future. Despite\nsignificant advances, balancing exploration and exploitation in CTTA is still\nchallenging: 1) Existing methods focus on adjusting predictions based on\ndeep-layer outputs of neural networks. However, domain shifts typically affect\nshallow features, which are inefficient to be adjusted from deep predictions,\nleading to dilatory exploration; 2) A single model inevitably forgets knowledge\nof previous domains during the exploration, making it incapable of exploiting\nhistorical knowledge to handle similar future domains. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a mean teacher framework that strikes an\nappropriate Balance between Exploration and Exploitation (BEE) during the CTTA\nprocess. For the former challenge, we introduce a Multi-level Consistency\nRegularization (MCR) loss that aligns the intermediate features of the student\nand teacher models, accelerating adaptation to the current domain. For the\nlatter challenge, we employ a Complementary Anchor Replay (CAR) mechanism to\nreuse historical checkpoints (anchors), recovering complementary knowledge for\ndiverse domains.

However, existing models are not explicitly designed to detect the\ndiverse patterns of off-chain cryptocurrency money laundering.

Failure to account for these patterns may result in\nunder-detection or omission of specific laundering activities, diminishing\nmodel accuracy and allowing schemes to bypass detection. To address this gap,\nwe propose the MPOCryptoML model to effectively detect multiple laundering\npatterns in cryptocurrency transactions.

Additionally, we introduce two novel algorithms by analyzing the\ntimestamp and weight of transactions in high-volume financial networks to\ndetect various money laundering structures, including fan-in, fan-out,\nbipartite, gather-scatter, and stack patterns. We further examine correlations\nbetween these patterns using a logistic regression model.

To solve the problem in an online fashion, we propose a\nmetamodel-based algorithm that leverages simulation results from previous\nstages to enhance decision-making.

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of vehicular communication facilities and\nautonomous driving technologies, connected vehicle platooning has emerged as a\npromising approach to improve traffic efficiency and driving safety. Reliable\nVehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication is critical to achieving efficient\ncooperative control. However, in the real-world traffic environment, V2V\ncommunication may suffer from time-varying delay and packet loss, leading to\ndegraded control performance and even safety risks. To mitigate the adverse\neffects of non-ideal communication, this paper proposes a Dynamic Communication\nTopology based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DCT-MARL) algorithm for\nrobust cooperative platoon control. Specifically, the state space is augmented\nwith historical control action and delay to enhance robustness against\ncommunication delay. To mitigate the impact of packet loss, a multi-key gated\ncommunication mechanism is introduced, which dynamically adjusts the\ncommunication topology based on the correlation between vehicles and their\ncurrent communication status. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nDCT-MARL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of string\nstability and driving comfort, validating its superior robustness and\neffectiveness.",

Despite their widespread appearance, a comprehensive study\nof their computational complexity is surprisingly lacking. This paper aims to\nfill that gap by presenting several results related to the computational aspect\nof $U$-statistics. First, we derive a useful decomposition from an $m$-th order\n$U$-statistic to a linear combination of $V$-statistics with orders not\nexceeding $m$, which are generally more feasible to compute. Second, we explore\nthe connection between exactly computing $V$-statistics and Einstein summation,\na tool often used in computational mathematics, quantum computing, and quantum\ninformation sciences for accelerating tensor computations. Third, we provide an\noptimistic estimate of the time complexity for exactly computing\n$U$-statistics, based on the treewidth of a particular graph associated with\nthe $U$-statistic kernel. The above ingredients lead to a new, much more\nruntime-efficient algorithm of exactly computing general higher-order\n$U$-statistics.

We demonstrate via three statistical\napplications that $\\texttt{u-stats}$ achieves impressive runtime performance\ncompared to existing benchmarks. This paper aspires to achieve two goals: (1)\nto capture the interest of researchers in both statistics and other related\nareas further to advance the algorithmic development of $U$-statistics, and (2)\nto offer the package $\\texttt{u-stats}$ as a valuable tool for practitioners,\nmaking the implementation of methods based on higher-order $U$-statistics a\nmore delightful experience.",

One challenge is accurate measurement of\nthe physical properties of massive protostars, such as current stellar mass,\nenvelope mass, outflow cavity properties, and system orientation. Spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) fitting is widely-used to test models against\nobservations. The far-infrared SED traces cold dust in envelopes, while the\nnear- and mid-infrared (MIR) probes emission from outflow cavities and/or the\ninner envelope. However, SED fitting has degeneracy limiting its ability to\nyield accurate measurements of protostellar properties. Here, we develop image\nprofile (IMPRO) fitting as a method to improve the characterization of\nprotostars. We utilize brightness distributions from multi-wavelength MIR\nimages of massive protostars taken by SOFIA/FORCAST as part of the SOFIA\nMassive Star Formation (SOMA) survey to constrain protostellar properties via\ncomparison to a grid of radiative transfer models. We develop a fitting\npipeline to extract information along the outflow axis, which is then combined\nwith the SED fitting to yield improved constraints on protostellar properties.\nWe apply the IMPRO fitting method on the nearby massive protostar Cepheus A,\nfinding that its properties become more tightly constrained compared to SED\nfitting, especially in the inclination of the source. However, for the more\ndistant G35.20-0.74N, we find that the spatial resolution of SOFIA/FORCAST\nlimits the utility of this combined fitting pipeline.

The field of\neXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) presents promising methods to create\nsuch explanations. But recent reviews about their performance offer reasons for\nskepticism. As we will argue, a good criterion for trustworthiness is\nexplanatory robustness: different XAI methods produce the same explanations in\ncomparable contexts. However, in some instances, all methods may give the same,\nbut still wrong, explanation. We therefore argue that in addition to\nexplanatory robustness (ER), a prior requirement of explanation method\nrobustness (EMR) has to be fulfilled by every XAI method. Conversely, the\nrobustness of an individual method is in itself insufficient for\ntrustworthiness. In what follows, we develop and formalize criteria for ER as\nwell as EMR, providing a framework for explaining and establishing trust in DL\nalgorithms.

Although association studies utilizing\nthe new sequencing technologies hold great promise to unravel novel genetic\nvariants, especially rare genetic variants that contribute to human diseases,\nthe statistical analysis of high-dimensional sequencing data remains a\nchallenge. Advanced analytical methods are in great need to facilitate\nhigh-dimensional sequencing data analyses. In this article, we propose a\ngeneralized genetic random field (GGRF) method for association analyses of\nsequencing data. Like other similarity-based methods (e.g., SIMreg and SKAT),\nthe new method has the advantages of avoiding the need to specify thresholds\nfor rare variants and allowing for testing multiple variants acting in\ndifferent directions and magnitude of effects. The method is built on the\ngeneralized estimating equation framework and thus accommodates a variety of\ndisease phenotypes (e.g., quantitative and binary phenotypes). Moreover, it has\na nice asymptotic property, and can be applied to small-scale sequencing data\nwithout need for small-sample adjustment. Through simulations, we demonstrate\nthat the proposed GGRF attains an improved or comparable power over a commonly\nused method, SKAT, under various disease scenarios, especially when rare\nvariants play a significant role in disease etiology. We further illustrate\nGGRF with an application to a real dataset from the Dallas Heart Study.

However, real-world deployment is often\nlimited to low-cost, single-antenna transceivers. In such bistatic Single-Input\nSingle-Output (SISO) setup, clock asynchrony introduces random phase offsets in\nChannel State Information (CSI), which cannot be mitigated using conventional\nmulti-antenna methods. This work proposes WiDFS 3.0, a lightweight bistatic\nSISO sensing framework that enables accurate delay and Doppler estimation from\ndistorted CSI by effectively suppressing Doppler mirroring ambiguity. It\noperates with only a single antenna at both the transmitter and receiver,\nmaking it suitable for low-complexity deployments.

The resulting\nunambiguous delay-Doppler-time features enable robust sensing with compact\nneural networks. Extensive experiments show that WiDFS 3.0 achieves accurate\nparameter estimation, with performance comparable to or even surpassing that of\nprior multi-antenna methods, especially in delay estimation. Validated under\nsingle- and multi-target scenarios, the extracted ambiguity-resolved features\nshow strong sensing accuracy and generalization.

However,\ntraining SNNs is challenging because of the non-differentiable spike generation\nfunction. To address this issue, the commonly used approach is to adopt the\nbackpropagation through time framework, while assigning the gradient of the\nnon-differentiable function with some surrogates. Similarly, Binary Neural\nNetworks (BNNs) also face the non-differentiability problem and rely on\napproximating gradients. However, the deep relationship between these two\nfields and how their training techniques can benefit each other has not been\nsystematically researched. Furthermore, training binary-weight SNNs is even\nmore difficult. In this work, we present a novel perspective on the dynamics of\nSNNs and their close connection to BNNs through an analysis of the\nbackpropagation process. We demonstrate that training a feedforward SNN can be\nviewed as training a self-ensemble of a binary-activation neural network with\nnoise injection. Drawing from this new understanding of SNN dynamics, we\nintroduce the Self-Ensemble Inspired training method for (Binary-Weight) SNNs\n(SEI-BWSNN), which achieves high-performance results with low latency even for\nthe case of the 1-bit weights. Specifically, we leverage a structure of\nmultiple shortcuts and a knowledge distillation-based training technique to\nimprove the training of (binary-weight) SNNs.

Using the Belgium Electricity Short-Term Load\nForecasting dataset as a case study, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrids\nconsistently outperform standalone foundation models across multiple horizons.\nRegression-based ensembles achieve the lowest mean squared error; bootstrap\naggregation markedly reduces long-context errors; residual modeling corrects\nsystematic bias; and the resulting prediction intervals achieve near nominal\ncoverage with widths shrinking as context length increases. The results\nindicate that integrating statistical reasoning with modern foundation models\nyields measurable gains in accuracy, reliability, and interpretability for\nreal-world time series applications.",

The goal is to study whether the\ncomonotonic and countermonotonic modifications of those two random variables\ncan be used to construct upper and lower bounds for the expected payoff,\ndespite the fact that the payoff function is neither convex nor concave. The\nanswer to the central question of the paper requires studying the crossing\npoints of the cdf of the original difference with the cdfs of its comonotonic\nand countermonotonic transforms. The analysis is supplemented with a numerical\nstudy of longevity trend bonds, using different mortality models and population\ndata. The numerical study reveals that for these mortality-linked securities\nthe three pairs of cdfs generally have unique pairwise crossing points. Under\nsymmetric copulas, all crossing points can reasonably be approximated by the\ndifference of the marginal medians, but this approximation is not necessarily\nvalid for asymmetric copulas. Nevertheless, extreme dependence structures can\ngive rise to bounds if the layers of the bond are selected to hedge tail risk.\nFurther, the dependence uncertainty spread can be low if the layers are\nselected to hedge median risk, and, subject to a trade-off, to hedge tail risk\nas well.",

Higher spectral\nresolution data for the Cyg OB2-12 sightline in the 3 micron region allows a\ndetailed comparison of the 3.4 micron aliphatic bands to those observed toward\nthe Quintuplet.

Analysis\nof these bands, produced by aromatic, aliphatic, olefinic, hydrogenated, and\noxygenated components, shows that carbonaceous dust is a significant component\nof the diffuse interstellar medium, second in abundance only to silicates, and\nis primarily aromatic in nature. The grains producing these bands likely\nconsist of large aromatic carbon cores with thin aliphatic mantles composed of\nhydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC).

However,\ngenerative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to\nhallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.\nFurthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less\neffective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on\ndomain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a\nreasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through\ntraining reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,\nour DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its\nown OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to\nobtain their results as references, finally \"looks again\" the image and\nrethinks about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content.\nSince architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which\nmakes them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate\nhallucinations. We evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and\nexperimental results show that our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently\noutperform their non-reasoning counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves\nthe effectiveness of our method.

As C/O white dwarfs (WDs) crystallize, they are predicted to\ngo through a distillation process in the central layers if they have a\nsufficiently high $^{22}$Ne mass fraction of $\\gtrsim2.5$\\%. Observational\nevidence for distillation comes from an over-density of WDs on the Q-branch in\nGaia color-magnitude diagrams, which indicates that $\\sim6$\\% of massive WDs\nare delayed in their cooling by as much as $\\sim10$ Gyr. However, it is unclear\nhow these stars end up with such a high concentration of $^{22}$Ne and if a\nsignificant fraction of the more common average-mass WDs go through\ndistillation. We argue that a significant metal-rich stellar population in the\nsolar neighborhood should lead to distilled WDs, without requiring a binary\nmerger. We use MESA along with the CNO abundances derived from high-resolution\nspectroscopy of stars included in the Hypatia catalog to predict the $^{22}$Ne\nmass fraction in their descendant WDs. We find that 0.6-2.5\\% of the WDs in the\nsolar neighborhood have sufficient $^{22}$Ne in their interiors to go through\nmulti-Gyr cooling delays, which could significantly inflate their numbers in\nthe observed samples. Hence, $^{22}$Ne distillation and long-lived habitable\nzones around WDs should be relatively common in the solar neighborhood. We also\nuse a Galactic model to predict the fraction of WDs that go through\ndistillation as a function of Galactocentric distance. The fraction of\ndistilled WDs is $\\sim2$-8\\% near the Galactic center, and declines steadily\ntoward the outer disk.",

When electron-irradiated polymethyl methacrylate\n(PMMA) undergoes breakdown, the resulting channels exhibit striking periodic\nstructures with characteristic wavelengths ~80 {\\mu}m in the recently\nidentified ivy-mode channels. These previously unobserved modulations offer\nunique insights into the physics of ultra-fast dielectric breakdown. Through\nmaterials characterization and theoretical modeling, we identify the physical\ninstability mechanism responsible for these structures. Raman spectroscopy\nreveals that carbon deposition correlates with channel width variations,\nindicating that periodic structure formation occurs during the plasma discharge\nphase. We evaluated three candidate instability mechanisms: the\nAsaro-Tiller-Grinfeld instability, the Plateau-Rayleigh instability, and the\nz-pinch entropy mode. The first two mechanisms operate on incompatible\ntimescales and require unphysical material parameters to match observations. In\ncontrast, the z-pinch entropy mode operates during the nanosecond discharge\nphase and produces wavelengths consistent with plasma densities of 0.1-1% of\nsolid density and temperatures of 10-100 eV. Current measurements from isolated\ndischarge channels (~200 A) validate theoretical predictions for the entropy\nmode. These findings establish that the entropy mode plasma instability during\nthe discharge phase, rather than post discharge thermal or mechanical\nprocesses, govern periodic structure formation in breakdown channels.

    "abstract": "Many reasoning techniques for large multimodal models adapt language model\napproaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which express reasoning\nas word sequences. While effective for text, these methods are suboptimal for\nmultimodal contexts, struggling to align audio, visual, and textual information\ndynamically. To explore an alternative paradigm, we propose the Multimodal\nChain of Continuous Thought (MCOUT), which enables reasoning directly in a\njoint latent space rather than in natural language. In MCOUT, the reasoning\nstate is represented as a continuous hidden vector, iteratively refined and\naligned with visual and textual embeddings, inspired by human reflective\ncognition. We develop two variants: MCOUT-Base, which reuses the language\nmodel`s last hidden state as the continuous thought for iterative reasoning,\nand MCOUT-Multi, which integrates multimodal latent attention to strengthen\ncross-modal alignment between visual and textual features. Experiments on\nbenchmarks including MMMU, ScienceQA, and MMStar show that MCOUT consistently\nimproves multimodal reasoning, yielding up to 8.23% accuracy gains over strong\nbaselines and improving BLEU scores up to 8.27% across multiple-choice and\nopen-ended tasks.

This paper presents a Unified Skeleton-based Dense\nRepresentation Learning (USDRL) framework, which serves as a foundational model\nfor skeleton-based human action understanding. USDRL consists of a\nTransformer-based Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE), Multi-Grained Feature\nDecorrelation (MG-FD), and Multi-Perspective Consistency Training (MPCT). The\nDSTE module adopts two parallel streams to learn temporal dynamic and spatial\nstructure features.

The MPCT module\nemploys both multi-view and multi-modal self-supervised consistency training.\nThe former enhances the learning of high-level semantics and mitigates the\nimpact of low-level discrepancies, while the latter effectively facilitates the\nlearning of informative multimodal features.

Here we develop a qubit parametrization of\nthe gauge constrained algorithm of VDAT at \\mathcal{N}=3 for the multiorbital\nHubbard model with general density-density interactions. The qubit\nparametrization yields an explicit variational trial energy, and the\nvariational parameters consist of the momentum density distribution, the shape\nof a reference fermi surface, and the pure state of a qubit system with\ndimension of the local Hilbert space. To illustrate the power of the qubit\nparametrization, we solve for the ground state properties of the multiorbital\nHubbard model with Hund coupling for local orbital number N_{orb}=2-7. A Taylor\nseries expansion of the partially optimized trial energy is used to explain how\nthe Hund's coupling changes the order of the Mott transition. For the case of\nthe SU(2N_{orb}) Hubbard model, an explicit approach for computing the critical\nU_{c} for the Mott transition is provided, yielding an analytical expression\nfor U_{c} in the large N_{orb} limit. Additionally, we provide an analytical\nsolution for the ground state properties of the single band Hubbard model with\na special density of states. Finally, we demonstrate that the qubit\nparametrization can also be applied to \\mathcal{N}=2, for both G-type and\nB-type variants, where the G-type yields an identical expression to the slave\nspin mean-field theory.

    "abstract": "It is well known that the reachability problem for simply-typed lambda\ncalculus with recursive definitions and finite base-type values (finitary PCF)\nis decidable. A recent paper by Dal Lago and Ghyselen has shown that the same\nproblem becomes undecidable when the language is extended with algebraic effect\nand handlers (effect handlers). We show that, perhaps surprisingly, the problem\nbecomes decidable even with effect handlers when the type system is extended\nwith answer type modification (ATM). A natural intuition may find the result\ncontradictory, because one would expect allowing ATM makes more programs\ntypable. Indeed, this intuition is correct in that there are programs that are\ntypable with ATM but not without it, as we shall show in the paper. However, a\ncorollary of our decidability result is that the converse is true as well:\nthere are programs that are typable without ATM but becomes untypable with ATM,\nand we will show concrete examples of such programs in the paper. Our\ndecidability result is proven by a novel continuation passing style (CPS)\ntransformation that transforms an ATM-typable finitary PCF program with effect\nhandlers to a finitary PCF program without effect handlers. Additionally, as\nanother application of our CPS transformation, we show that every\nrecursive-function-free ATM-typable finitary PCF program with effect handlers\nterminates, while there are (necessarily ATM-untypable) recursive-function-free\nfinitary PCF programs with effect handlers that may diverge. Finally, we\ndisprove a claim made in a recent work that proved a similar but strictly\nweaker decidability result. We foresee our decidability result to lay a\nfoundation for developing verification methods for programs with effect\nhandlers, just as the decidability result for reachability of finitary PCF has\ndone such for programs without effect handlers.",

To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel CNN-based algorithm called SFAC, i.e., Structure-preserving Feature\nAlignment Colorizer.

To mitigate this, we introduce a structure-preserving\nmechanism that incorporates a perceptual constraint at the feature level and a\nfrozen-updated pyramid at the pixel level.

To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics\nfrom time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework\nusing the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by\nconstruction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the\nfirst and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a\ndiscrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium\nstatistics.

This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering\n(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved\nautoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.\nThis novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction\nby combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within\nan autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage\nof the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further\nimprove a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional\nloss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five\nbenchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.\nThe framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy\nof 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo!

    "abstract": "Crust quakes are frequently invoked as a mechanism to trigger sudden\ntransients in the magnetospheres of magnetars. In this picture, a mechanical\nfailure of the crust excites seismic motions of the magnetar surface that\nlaunch force-free waves into the magnetosphere. We first investigate this\nproblem analytically and then perform three-dimensional numerical simulations.\nOur simulations follow the propagation of high-frequency magneto-elastic waves\nin the entire crust, and include magnetic coupling to the dipolar magnetosphere\nand liquid core through simplified radiation boundary conditions. We observe\nseismic waves bouncing between the crust-core interface and the surface with a\ncharacteristic frequency $\\sim 1$ kHz, which could appear as a modulation of\nthe magnetospheric radiation. Both the star quake and its associated\nmagnetospheric wave emission are strongly damped on a timescale $\\sim 10 \\ \\rm\nms$ by magnetic coupling to the liquid core. Since seismic waves are\nsignificantly damped before they can spread laterally around the crust,\nmagnetospheric wave emission occurs primarily near the initial epicenter of the\nquake. Our simulations suggest that non-axisymmetric quakes will launch a\nmixture of Alfv\\'en and fast magnetosonic waves into the magnetosphere. The\nresults will be important for interpreting magnetar bursts and understanding\nthe possible trigger mechanisms of fast radio bursts.",

Although medical AI has been rapidly\nadvancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains\nlimited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally\nstems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,\nphysicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In\ncontrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target\nlesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical\nAI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to\ndiagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning\nPolicy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the\nphysicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.\nWe used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou\nUniversity Hospital.

In this paper, we propose a motion-based\ntemporal and rotational calibration framework tailored for event-centric\nmulti-sensor systems, eliminating the need for dedicated calibration targets.\nOur method uses as input the rotational motion estimates obtained from event\ncameras and other heterogeneous sensors, respectively. Different from\nconventional approaches that rely on event-to-frame conversion, our method\nefficiently estimates angular velocity from normal flow observations, which are\nderived from the spatio-temporal profile of event data. The overall calibration\npipeline adopts a two-step approach: it first initializes the temporal offset\nand rotational extrinsics by exploiting kinematic correlations in the spirit of\nCanonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and then refines both temporal and\nrotational parameters through a joint non-linear optimization using a\ncontinuous-time parametrization in SO(3). Extensive evaluations on both\npublicly available and self-collected datasets validate that the proposed\nmethod achieves calibration accuracy comparable to target-based methods, while\nexhibiting superior stability over purely CCA-based methods, and highlighting\nits precision, robustness and flexibility.

The calibrated virial theorem achieves negligible\nsystematic bias (mean $\\Delta$ = -0.01 dex) and low scatter (mean $\\sigma$ =\n0.20 dex) with no sensitivity to baryonic physics. The calibrated SHMR yields\nthe highest precision (mean $\\Delta$ = 0.02 dex, mean $\\sigma$ = 0.14 dex) but\nshows greater model dependence due to sensitivity to baryonic physics across\nthe models. We demonstrate applications to observational catalogues, including\nthe empirical halo mass function and mapping quenched fractions in the stellar\nmass-halo mass plane. We provide guidance: the virial theorem is recommended\nfor GAMA-like surveys (i < 19.2) at z < 0.1 where minimal model dependence is\nrequired, while the SHMR is optimal for high-precision halo mass estimates\nacross diverse catalogues with limits of z < 0.3. These calibrated estimators\nwill aid upcoming wide-area spectroscopic surveys in probing the connection\nbetween galaxies and their host dark matter halos.",

Despite the emergence of various frameworks, e.g.,\nLangChain, AutoML, and AIDE, ML scientists still struggle to effectively review\nand adjust the agents' coding process. The current approach of manually\ninspecting individual outputs is inefficient, making it difficult to track code\nevolution, compare coding iterations, and identify improvement opportunities.\nTo address this challenge, we introduce a visual analytics system designed to\nenhance the examination of coding agent behaviors. Focusing on the AIDE\nframework, our system supports comparative analysis across three levels: (1)\nCode-Level Analysis, which reveals how the agent debugs and refines its code\nover iterations; (2) Process-Level Analysis, which contrasts different\nsolution-seeking processes explored by the agent; and (3) LLM-Level Analysis,\nwhich highlights variations in coding behavior across different LLMs. By\nintegrating these perspectives, our system enables ML scientists to gain a\nstructured understanding of agent behaviors, facilitating more effective\ndebugging and prompt engineering. Through case studies using coding agents to\ntackle popular Kaggle competitions, we demonstrate how our system provides\nvaluable insights into the iterative coding process.",

We model\nthe deformation of an object as an elastostatic process and derive a governing\nPoisson equation for estimating its SDF from a sparse set of pose and force\nmeasurements. By incorporating steady-state elastodynamic assumptions, we show\nthat the undeformed SDF can be recovered from deformed observations with\nprovable convergence. Our approach also enables the estimation of material\nstiffness by analyzing displacement responses to varying force inputs. We\ndemonstrate the robustness of PROD in handling pose errors, non-normal force\napplication, and curvature errors in simulated soft body interactions.

Additionally, items are partitioned into\ngroups, and each platform also incurs group-specific convex cost over the\nnumber of items from each group that can be assigned to the platform. These\ncosts promote group fairness by penalizing imbalances, yielding a soft\nvariation of fairness notions introduced in prior work, such as Restricted\nDominance and Minority protection. Restricted Dominance enforces upper bounds\non group representation, while Minority protection enforces lower bounds. Our\napproach replaces such hard constraints with cost-based penalties, allowing\nmore flexible trade-offs.

This paper examines the source of this impossibility in more detail by\nconsidering the aggregation of a general class of incomplete preferences that\ncan represent gradual ambiguity perceptions. Our result shows that the planner\ncannot avoid ignoring some individuals unless there is a probability\ndistribution that all individuals agree is most plausible. This means that even\nif individuals have similar ambiguity perceptions, the impossibility persists\nas long as some individual's most plausible belief differs even slightly from\nthose of others.",

    "abstract": "Insight into how information can propagate within cortical networks is\nessential for a more complete understanding of neural dynamics and computation\nin complex networks. Networks with clustered connections have previously been\nshown to give rise to correlated dynamics in individual clusters. However, this\nsame model applied to a network with highly heterogeneous cluster sizes leads\nto a clear breakdown of the balanced state. In this article, using a formal\ndefinition of the balance matrix, we show why the balance condition breaks and\npropose a solution to restore balance in heterogeneous networks by reweighing\nthe connection strengths based on community sizes. We introduce a method of\npartially balancing a heterogeneous network and show that the degree of\nspontaneous synchronization within communities can be varied using a single\nparameter describing the reweighing. We further show that stimuli can propagate\nthrough a hierarchically clustered network, where stimulating one cluster of\nneurons in a densely connected pair induces correlated firing in the other\nwithout propagating to other weakly connected clusters.",

    "abstract": "Engineering education has historically been constrained by rigid,\nstandardized frameworks, often neglecting students' diverse learning needs and\ninterests. While significant advancements have been made in online and\npersonalized education within K-12 and foundational sciences, engineering\neducation at both undergraduate and graduate levels continues to lag in\nadopting similar innovations. Traditional evaluation methods, such as exams and\nhomework assignments, frequently overlook individual student requirements,\nimpeding personalized educational experiences. To address these limitations,\nthis paper introduces the Personalized AI-Powered Progressive Learning (PAPPL)\nplatform, an advanced Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) designed specifically\nfor engineering education. It highlights the development of a scalable,\ndata-driven tutoring environment leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to\nenhance personalized learning across diverse academic disciplines, particularly\nin STEM fields. PAPPL integrates core ITS components including the expert\nmodule, student module, tutor module, and user interface, and utilizes GPT-4o,\na sophisticated large language model (LLM), to deliver context-sensitive and\npedagogically sound hints based on students' interactions. The system uniquely\nrecords student attempts, detects recurring misconceptions, and generates\nprogressively targeted feedback, providing personalized assistance that adapts\ndynamically to each student's learning profile. Additionally, PAPPL offers\ninstructors detailed analytics, empowering evidence-based adjustments to\nteaching strategies. This study provides a fundamental framework for the\nprogression of Generative ITSs scalable to all education levels, delivering\nimportant perspectives on personalized progressive learning and the wider\npossibilities of Generative AI in the field of education.",

Nevertheless, it remains\nunclear to what extent the prevailing assumptions and proposed solutions are\nvalid and how significant CPL is in real-world data. To address this gap, we\nfirst perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of five widely used LDP\nmechanisms -- GRR, RAPPOR, OUE, OLH and Exponential mechanism -- to assess CPL\nacross four real-world datasets. We identify that many primary assumptions and\nmetrics in current approaches fall short of accurately characterising these\nleakages. Moreover, current studies have been limited to a set of pure LDP\n(i.e., {\\delta = 0}) mechanisms. In response, we develop the first algorithmic\nframework to theoretically quantify CPL for any general approximated LDP\n(({\\varepsilon},{\\delta})-LDP) mechanism. We validate our theoretical results\nagainst empirical statistical results and provide a theoretical explanation for\nthe observed statistical patterns. Finally, we propose two novel benchmarks to\nvalidate correlation analysis algorithms and evaluate the utility vs CPL of LDP\nmechanisms. Further, we demonstrate how these findings can be applied to\nachieve an efficient privacy-utility trade-off in real-world data governance.",

    "abstract": "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a universal standard that\nenables AI agents to seamlessly connect with external tools, significantly\nenhancing their functionality. However, while MCP brings notable benefits, it\nalso introduces significant vulnerabilities, such as Tool Poisoning Attacks\n(TPA), where hidden malicious instructions exploit the sycophancy of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to manipulate agent behavior. Despite these risks,\ncurrent academic research on MCP security remains limited, with most studies\nfocusing on narrow or qualitative analyses that fail to capture the diversity\nof real-world threats. To address this gap, we present the MCP Attack Library\n(MCPLIB), which categorizes and implements 31 distinct attack methods under\nfour key classifications: direct tool injection, indirect tool injection,\nmalicious user attacks, and LLM inherent attack. We further conduct a\nquantitative analysis of the efficacy of each attack. Our experiments reveal\nkey insights into MCP vulnerabilities, including agents' blind reliance on tool\ndescriptions, sensitivity to file-based attacks, chain attacks exploiting\nshared context, and difficulty distinguishing external data from executable\ncommands. These insights, validated through attack experiments, underscore the\nurgency for robust defense strategies and informed MCP design. Our\ncontributions include 1) constructing a comprehensive MCP attack taxonomy, 2)\nintroducing a unified attack framework MCPLIB, and 3) conducting empirical\nvulnerability analysis to enhance MCP security mechanisms.
