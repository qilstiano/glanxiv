    "abstract": "In recent years, U.S. Department of Transportation has adopts Institute of\nElectrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1609 series to build the security\ncredential management system (SCMS) for being the standard of connected cars in\nU.S. Furthermore, a butterfly key expansion (BKE) method in SCMS has been\ndesigned to provide pseudonym certificates for improving the privacy of\nconnected cars. However, the BKE method is designed based on elliptic curve\ncryptography (ECC) in the standard of IEEE 1609.2.1, but more execution time is\nrequired for key expansion. Therefore, this study proposes an original\nefficient key expansion method, and the mathematical principles have been\nproposed to prove the encryption/decryption feasibility, car privacy, and\nmethod efficiency. In a practical environment, the proposed method improves the\nefficiency of key expansion method in IEEE 1609.2.1-2022 with the same security\nstrength thousands of times.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring the privacy of votes in an election is crucial for the integrity of\na democratic process. Often, voting power is delegated to representatives\n(e.g., in congress) who subsequently vote on behalf of voters on specific\nissues. This delegation model is also widely used in Decentralized Autonomous\nOrganizations (DAOs). Although several existing voting systems used in DAOs\nsupport private voting, they only offer public delegation. In this paper, we\nintroduce Kite, a new protocol that enables $\\textit{private}$ delegation of\nvoting power for DAO members. Voters can freely delegate, revoke, and\nre-delegate their power without revealing any information about who they\ndelegated to. Even the delegate does not learn who delegated to them. The only\ninformation that is recorded publicly is that the voter delegated or\nre-delegated their vote to someone. Kite accommodates both public and private\nvoting for the delegates themselves. We analyze the security of our protocol\nwithin the Universal Composability (UC) framework. We implement Kite as an\nextension to the existing Governor Bravo smart contract on the Ethereum\nblockchain, that is widely used for DAO governance. Furthermore, we provide an\nevaluation of our implementation that demonstrates the practicality of the\nprotocol. The most expensive operation is delegation due to the required\nzero-knowledge proofs. On a consumer-grade laptop, delegation takes between 7\nand 167 seconds depending on the requested level of privacy.",

In this paper, we conduct a case study to investigate the\ncapability of using LLMs, particularly GPT-4o, for field of view (FOV) analysis\nin VR exploration testing. Specifically, we validate that LLMs can identify\ntest entities in FOVs and that prompt engineering can effectively enhance the\naccuracy of test entity identification from 41.67% to 71.30%. Our study also\nshows that LLMs can accurately describe identified entities' features with at\nleast a 90% accuracy rate. We further find out that the core features that\neffectively represent an entity are color, placement, and shape. Furthermore,\nthe combination of the three features can especially be used to improve the\naccuracy of determining identical entities in multiple FOVs with the highest\nF1-score of 0.70. Additionally, our study demonstrates that LLMs are capable of\nscene recognition and spatial understanding in VR with precisely designed\nstructured prompts.

    "abstract": "We introduce a quadratically-constrained approximation (QCAC) of the AC\noptimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem. Unlike existing approximations like the\nDC-OPF, our model does not rely on typical assumptions such as high\nreactance-to-resistance ratio, near-nominal voltage magnitudes, or small angle\ndifferences, and preserves the structural sparsity of the original AC power\nflow equations, making it suitable for decentralized power systems optimization\nproblems. To achieve this, we reformulate the AC-OPF problem as a quadratically\nconstrained quadratic program. The nonconvex terms are expressed as differences\nof convex functions, which are then convexified around a base point derived\nfrom a warm start of the nodal voltages. If this linearization results in a\nnon-empty constraint set, the convexified constraints form an inner convex\napproximation. Our experimental results, based on Power Grid Library instances\nof up to 30,000 buses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the QCAC approximation\nwith respect to other well-documented conic relaxations and a linear\napproximation. We further showcase its potential advantages over the\nwell-documented second-order conic relaxation of the power flow equations in\ntwo proof-of-concept case studies: optimal reactive power dispatch in\ntransmission networks and PV hosting capacity in distribution grids.",

Although autonomous\nwheelchairs significantly reduce user effort, they still require human input to\nallow users to maintain control and adapt to changing environments. Brain\nComputer Interface (BCI) stands out as a highly user-friendly option that does\nnot require physical movement. Current BCI systems can understand whether users\nwant to accelerate or decelerate, but they implement these changes in discrete\nspeed steps rather than allowing for smooth, continuous velocity adjustments.\nThis limitation prevents the systems from mimicking the natural, fluid speed\nchanges seen in human self-paced motion. The authors aim to address this\nlimitation by redesigning the perception-action cycle in a BCI controlled\nrobotic system: improving how the robotic agent interprets the user's motion\nintentions (world state) and implementing these actions in a way that better\nreflects natural physical properties of motion, such as inertia and damping.\nThe scope of this paper focuses on the perception aspect. We asked and answered\na normative question \"what computation should the robotic agent carry out to\noptimally perceive incomplete or noisy sensory observations?\" Empirical EEG\ndata were collected, and probabilistic representation that served as world\nstate distributions were learned and evaluated in a Generative Adversarial\nNetwork framework. The ROS framework was established that connected with a\nGazebo environment containing a digital twin of an indoor space and a virtual\nmodel of a robotic wheelchair. Signal processing and statistical analyses were\nimplemented to identity the most discriminative features in the\nspatial-spectral-temporal dimensions, which are then used to construct the\nworld model for the robotic agent to interpret user motion intentions as a\nBayesian observer.",

Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant\nfractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter\nphysics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials.\nThis field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations,\ntopological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the\nKitaev model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare\nexactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin\ndegrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an\napplied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically\nnon-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering\npotential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian\ncharacter of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection\nto certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum\nHall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could\nmanifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and\nruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In\nparticular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and\ntopological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator\nRuCl3. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This\nreview begins with a brief review on QSLs in other systems, followed by a\ncomprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a\nparticular focus on RuCl3. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is\nto inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current\nliterature and perspectives.",

The PRM integrates information on the instantaneous attitude\nprovided by the telescope control system to determine the actual pointing\ndirection and focal plane orientation of the telescope. It accounts for various\nnon-idealities in the telescope setup, represented by eight configuration\nangles, which will be calibrated using the Star Tracker.

This paper also describes the main structure and operations\nof the Star Tracker and presents the results of a campaign of actual sky\nobservations conducted with a prototype. The results demonstrate a Star Tracker\nRMS accuracy of approximately 3 arcseconds, while systematic errors remain\nbelow 10 arcseconds. Based on these results, we analyzed the problem of\nreconstructing the PRM configuration angles. Two methods for intercalibrating\nthe Star Tracker's pointing direction with respect to the focal plane's\npointing direction were examined: (1) observations of planets and (2)\nobservations of a drone carrying both an optical beacon and a radio beacon. In\nthe first case, an intercalibration accuracy between 1/3 arcminute and 1\narcminute is achievable.

Traditional tools used for periodic\nsearches, such as the periodogram, have poorly defined statistical properties\nunder irregular sampling, which complicate inferring the underlying aperiodic\nvariability used for hypothesis testing. The problem is exacerbated in the\npresence of stochastic variability, which can be easily mistaken by genuine\nperiodic behaviour, particularly in the case of poorly sampled lightcurves.\nHere we present a method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) modelling for period\nsearches and characterization, specifically developed to overcome these\nproblems. We argue that in cases of irregularly-sampled time series, GPs offer\nan appealing alternative to traditional periodograms, because the known\ndistribution of the data (correlated Gaussian) allows a well-defined likelihood\nto be constructed. We exploit this property and draw from existing statistical\nmethods to perform traditional likelihood ratio tests for an additional,\n(quasi-)periodic component, using the aperiodic variability inferred from the\ndata as the null hypothesis. Inferring the noise from the data allows the\nmethod to be fully generalizable, with the only condition that the data can be\ndescribed as a Gaussian process. We demonstrate the method by applying it to a\nvariety of objects showing varying levels of noise and data quality.\nLimitations of the method are discussed and a package implementing the proposed\nmethodology is made publicly available.",

The novel test appears\nto be well calibrated, much better than the Little's MCAR test that was used as\na benchmark. For the alternatives that were detectable for the old test, the\nnovel test has comparable, although slightly lower, power as the old one, but\nis still able to outperform Little's test in all of the studied scenarios. For\nalternatives that were previously undetectable or barely detectable, the novel\ntest performs the best of three.

In many such cases, the fundamental principles of the correlations\nbetween observables are often better understood than the actual distributions\nof the observables themselves.

This study investigates the effects of occupational question wording\non data variability and the performance of automatic coding tools. We conducted\nand replicated a split-ballot survey experiment in Germany using two common\noccupational question formats: one focusing on 'job title' (Berufsbezeichnung)\nand another on 'occupational tasks' (berufliche T\\\"atigkeit). Our analysis\nreveals that automatic coding tools, such as CASCOT and OccuCoDe, exhibit\nsensitivity to the form and origin of the data. Specifically, these tools were\nmore efficient when coding responses to the job title question format compared\nwith the occupational task format, suggesting a potential way to improve the\nrespective questions for many German surveys. In a subsequent 'detailed tasks\nand duties' question, providing a guiding example prompted respondents to give\nlonger answers without broadening the range of unique words they used. These\nfindings highlight the importance of harmonising survey questions and of\nensuring that automatic coding tools are robust to differences in question\nwording. We emphasise the need for further research to optimise question design\nand coding tools for greater accuracy and applicability in occupational data\ncollection.",

One key\nchallenge in the MPI image reconstruction task arises from its underlying noise\nmodel, which does not fulfill the implicit Gaussian assumptions that are made\nwhen applying traditional reconstruction approaches. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce the Learned Discrepancy Approach, a novel learning-based\nreconstruction method for inverse problems that includes a learned discrepancy\nfunction. It enhances traditional techniques by incorporating an invertible\nneural network to explicitly model problem-specific noise distributions. This\napproach does not rely on implicit Gaussian noise assumptions, making it\nespecially suited to handle the sophisticated noise model in MPI and also\napplicable to other inverse problems. To further advance MPI reconstruction\ntechniques, we introduce the MPI-MNIST dataset - a large collection of\nsimulated MPI measurements derived from the MNIST dataset of handwritten\ndigits. The dataset includes noise-perturbed measurements generated from\nstate-of-the-art model-based system matrices and measurements of a preclinical\nMPI scanner device. This provides a realistic and flexible environment for\nalgorithm testing. Validated against the MPI-MNIST dataset, our method\ndemonstrates significant improvements in reconstruction quality in terms of\nstructural similarity when compared to classical reconstruction techniques.",

There is\ngrowing interest in the study of their properties to investigate stellar and\nsupernova feedback. So far, the detection of cavities in observational and\nnumerical data is mostly done visually and, hence, is prone to biases.\nTherefore, we present an automated, objective method for discovering cavities\nin particle simulations, with demonstrations using hydrodynamical simulations\nof a dwarf galaxy. The suggested technique extracts holes based on the\npersistent homology of particle positions and identifies tight boundary points\naround each. With a synthetic ground-truth analysis, we investigate the\nrelationship between data density and the detection radius, demonstrating that\nhigher data density also allows for the robust detection of smaller cavities.\nBy tracking the boundary points, we can measure the shape and physical\nproperties of the cavity, such as its temperature. In this contribution, we\ndetect 808 holes in 21 simulation snapshots. We classified the holes into\nsupernova-blown bubbles and cavities unrelated to stellar feedback activity\nbased on their temperature profile and expansion behaviour during the 100\nmillion years covered by the simulation snapshots analysed for this work.\nSurprisingly, less than 40% of the detected cavities can unequivocally be\nlinked to stellar evolution. Moreover, about 36% of the cavities are\ncontracting, while 59% are expanding. The rest do not change for a few million\nyears. Clearly, it is erroneous to interpret observational data based on the\npremise that all cavities are supernova-related and expanding. This study\nreveals that supernova-driven bubbles typically exhibit smaller diameters,\nlarger expansion velocities, and lower kinetic ages (with a maximum of 220\nmillion years) compared to other cavities.",

The source is known to exhibit strong excess soft X-ray\nemission, which we show is well represented by thermal disk photons Comptonized\nby a warm plasma spanning the inner accretion flow. Additionally, the EPIC-pn\ndata provide compelling evidence ($\\Delta C\\sim60$ for 4 additional parameters)\nfor the presence of an ultrafast outflow (UFO) with a line-of-sight velocity\n$v/c=0.307^{+0.001}_{-0.005}$, and an emission signature consistent with\nreflection of the corona from modestly ionized, outflowing gas. The\nsimultaneous $0.5-2.5$\\,keV RGS spectra show clear absorption lines. Modelling\nof these data confirms the presence of the UFO and constrains its equivalent\nhydrogen column density, log $N_\\mathrm{H}/$(atom cm$^{-2}$) =\n$21.7^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$.

The\nmeasured properties and time evolution of the UFO in REJ1034+396 suggest that\nit is formed from collisionally ionized plasma, launched from the disk surface\nand accelerated by radiation pressure. The high terminal velocity and\nsubstantial absorbing column density imply that the outflow carries sufficient\nmomentum and energy to transform its environment, being capable of driving out\nessentially all dust and gas it interacts with along the line of sight, even if\nthe AGN were initially surrounded by a Compton thick absorber.",

    "abstract": "The reionization of helium is thought to occur at $2.5\\lesssim z\\lesssim4$,\nmarking the last phase transition and final global heating event of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM). Since it is driven by rare quasars, helium\nreionization should give rise to strong temperature fluctuations in the IGM\nbetween neutral and recently-ionized regions of order $\\sigma (\\ln T) \\sim\n\\Delta T/T = 20-50\\%$. We introduce a novel method to search for\nreionization-induced temperature fluctuations in the IGM by using the effective\noptical depths of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest towards a large number of\nbackground quasars. Higher IGM temperatures give rise to lower effective\noptical depths in the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest, implying that temperature\nfluctuations will broaden the observed optical depth distribution. We measured\nthe distributions of effective Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest optical depths across $71$\nX-Shooter spectra from the XQ-100 survey in four redshift bins from $z=3.76$ to\n$z=4.19$ and compared them to a large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulation. A good agreement is found between the observations and the\nsimulation, which does not include temperature fluctuations; therefore, we do\nnot detect a signature of helium reionization. We then post-process the\nsimulations to include an increasing amount of temperature fluctuations until\nthe model becomes inconsistent with the observations. We obtain tight\nconstraints on $\\sigma (\\ln T) < 0.29 \\ (<0.40)$ at $2 \\sigma\\ (3 \\sigma)$ at\n$z=3.76$ when averaging over scales of $100$ comoving Mpc, and weaker\nconstraints for higher redshifts and smaller scales.

In graphs of average\ndegree $d$, our algorithm runs in $2^{(1-6/(5d))m}\\text{poly}(n)$ time, which\nhas far better dependence in $d$ than previous results. We also generalize our\nalgorithm to solve a problem known as List Edge Coloring, where each edge $e$\nin the input graph comes with a list $L_e\\subseteq\\left\\{1, \\dots, k\\right\\}$\nof colors, and we must determine whether we can assign each edge a color from\nits list so that no two edges incident to the same vertex receive the same\ncolor. We solve this problem in $2^{(1-6/(5k))m}\\text{poly}(n)$ time and\npolynomial space. The previous best algorithm for List Edge Coloring took\n$2^m\\text{poly}(n)$ time and space.",

    "abstract": "Space-based experiments, either orbiting the Earth or from scientific balloon\naltitudes, measure high-energy cosmic rays by measuring from above the\natmosphere the optical and radio signals generated by extensive air showers\n(EAS). These experiments are designed to have a large field-of-view (FoV) for\nobserving EAS which translates to monitoring the atmosphere over a large, $\\sim\n10^6$ km$^2$ area on the ground. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, $E_{CR}\n> ~\\sim 1$ EeV) are measured by using the isotropic near-UV air fluorescence\nsignal to finely sample the EAS development and to efficiently use the\natmosphere as a vast calorimeter. At UHE, these immense EAS particle cascades\nhave sufficient charged particle content to generate the relatively dim\nfluorescence light that propagates to the space-based instrument. Additionally,\nthe beamed Cherenkov light and geomagnetic radio emission from EAS arrive with\n$> ~\\sim 10$ ns impulse and are measured at small angles away from the cosmic\nray trajectories. In particular for optical Cherenkov measurements, the energy\nthresholds can be $> ~\\sim 1$ PeV, i.e. for very-high energy cosmic rays\n(VHECRs). ...\n  In this chapter, the nature of observing the UHECR-induced shower development\nfrom orbiting and balloon-borne experiments is detailed, both for missions that\nhave been flown and those currently in development. This will be accomplished\nby discussing experimental performance in terms of measuring the UHECR\nspectrum, UHECR nuclear composition, and UHECR arrival direction. The ability\nfor these experiments to also perform VHECR and VHE and UHE cosmic neutrino\nmeasurements will also be discussed.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the instabilities during the axisymmetric inflation of an\ninitially spherical magnetoelastic balloon, modeled as a magnetizable Ogden\nmaterial, under combined internal pressure and a non-uniform magnetic field\ngenerated by current-carrying coils. The nonlinear interplay of geometric and\nmaterial effects leads to governing equations sensitive to bifurcations and\ninstabilities. A coordinate singularity at the poles of the balloon is\nidentified within the system of governing differential equations, which is\nresolved through an appropriate choice of field variables and L'H\\^opital's\nrule. Stability analysis reveals that as inflation progresses, axisymmetry is\nbroken through a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation, resulting in a\npear-shaped equilibrium. This symmetry is later restored through a reverse\nsubcritical pitchfork bifurcation, forming an isolated loop of pear-shaped\nsolutions containing stable and unstable branches in the case of a\nsix-parameter Ogden material model (SPOM). The onset of symmetry-breaking\nbifurcations is influenced by material parameters and magnetic field intensity,\nwith critical values beyond which such bifurcations are suppressed. Both\nsymmetry-preserving and pear-shaped configurations are stable under small\nasymmetric perturbations in both magnetic and non-magnetic cases. Snap-through\ntransitions between pear-shaped and axisymmetric configurations are also\nobserved.",

By employing a non-Gaussian variational approach, we go\nbeyond the approximation of a constant superconducting (SC) gap. We show that\ndynamical properties of the system can be modified qualitatively, when space\nand time dependent renormalization of the SC gap and electron-impurity\nhybridization are included. For the ground state, we find the singlet-doublet\nphase transition and $\\pi$-phase shifts of the SC order parameter. For\ndynamics, first we consider spin dynamics following an abrupt connection of the\npolarized impurity to the 2D bath. We find rapid relaxation of impurity\npolarization and directional emission of a magnetization pulse, which becomes\ndamped as it propagates into the bulk. Then we analyze transport between two SC\nleads coupled through the impurity at finite bias voltage. Here we go beyond\nanalysis of the steady state to investigate full-time dynamics following an\nabrupt application of the bias voltage. We uncover four distinct regimes in the\ntransient dynamics and transport properties: (I) the AC Josephson effect\nregime; (II) dynamical competition between charge-density-wave (CDW) and SC\norders with transient Kondo correlations; (III) the coexistence of AC and DC\ncurrents facilitated by partial Kondo screening and dynamical stabilization of\nthe SC order; (IV) DC Kondo transport regime modified by the SC order. Regime\nII exhibits a dynamical transition from SC to CDW order that locally restores\nthe U(1) symmetry.

    "abstract": "Material flow analyses (MFAs) provide insight into supply chain level\nopportunities for resource efficiency. MFAs can be represented as networks with\nnodes that represent materials, processes, sectors or locations. MFA network\nstructure uncertainty (i.e., the existence or absence of flows between nodes)\nis pervasive and can undermine the reliability of the flow predictions. This\narticle investigates MFA network structure uncertainty by proposing candidate\nnode-and-flow structures and using Bayesian model selection to identify the\nmost suitable structures and Bayesian model averaging to quantify the\nparametric mass flow uncertainty. The results of this holistic approach to MFA\nuncertainty are used in conjunction with the input-output (I/O) method to make\nrisk-informed resource efficiency recommendation. These techniques are\ndemonstrated using a case study on the U.S. steel sector where 16 candidate\nstructures are considered. Model selection highlights 2 networks as most\nprobable based on data collected from the United States Geological Survey and\nthe World Steel Association. Using the I/O method, we then show that the\nconstruction sector accounts for the greatest mean share of domestic U.S. steel\nindustry emissions while the automotive and steel products sectors have the\nhighest mean emissions per unit of steel used in the end-use sectors. The\nuncertainty in the results is used to analyze which end-use sector should be\nthe focus of demand reduction efforts under different appetites for risk. This\narticle's methods generate holistic and transparent MFA uncertainty that\naccount for structural uncertainty, enabling decisions whose outcomes are more\nrobust to the uncertainty.",

At first, an embedded\noptimal control problem (EOCP) is defined by replacing the discrete switching\nsignal with a continuous embedded variable that can take intermediate values\nbetween the discrete modes. While embedding enables solutions of SOCPs via\nconventional techniques, optimal solutions of EOCPs often involve nonexistent\nmodes and thus may not be feasible for the SOCP. In the modified EOCP (MEOCP),\na concave function is added to the cost function to enforce a bang-bang\nsolution in the embedded variable, which results in feasible solutions for the\nSOCP. However, the MEOCP cannot guarantee the satisfaction of dwell-time\nconstraints.\n  In this paper, a MEOCP is combined with a filter layer to remove switching\ntimes that violate the dwell time constraint. Insertion gradients are used to\nminimize the effect of the filter on the optimal cost.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence has resulted in the advent\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) with the capacity to produce text that closely\nresembles human communication. These models have been seamlessly integrated\ninto diverse applications, enabling interactive and responsive communication\nacross multiple platforms. The potential utility of chatbots transcends these\ntraditional applications, particularly in research contexts, wherein they can\noffer valuable insights and facilitate the design of innovative experiments. In\nthis study, we present a Customizable LLM-Powered Chatbot (CLPC), a web-based\nchatbot system designed to assist in behavioral science research. The system is\nmeticulously designed to function as an experimental instrument rather than a\nconventional chatbot, necessitating users to input a username and experiment\ncode upon access. This setup facilitates precise data cross-referencing,\nthereby augmenting the integrity and applicability of the data collected for\nresearch purposes. It can be easily expanded to accommodate new basic events as\nneeded; and it allows researchers to integrate their own logging events without\nthe necessity of implementing a separate logging mechanism. It is worth noting\nthat our system was built to assist primarily behavioral science research but\nis not limited to it, it can easily be adapted to assist information retrieval\nresearch or interacting with chat bot agents in general.",

To this end, it is\nuseful to harness the resource of continuous-variable (CV) entanglement since\nit can be efficiently and unconditionally produced by squeezing light in a\nnonlinear medium and can be easily manipulated, distributed, and measured using\nstandard components.

We characterize transactions in\nterms of relevant and irrelevant features, requiring that the order be\ndetermined solely by the relevant ones.

By using a logistic classifier to\ncalculate the probability of assignment between the control and experimental\ngroups a log odds value or 'logit' score is assigned to each data point. After\nassignment of a logit score every data point in the treatment group is assigned\na comparable control in order to balance the potential confounding variables of\nan experiment. While a viable inference technique, many implementations of PSM\nfail to properly outline the methodology used, such as not explaining feature\nselection and matching techniques. This paper outlines multiple different\ntechniques for both feature selection and matching which then are compared\nbased on their efficiency. Three unique quantitative feature selection methods\nwere utilized including random removal, feature importance calculation, and\nindividual removal. Individual removal was the most efficient in consolidating\nthe overlap between the treatment and control groups. The matching techniques\nused were bisect, binary insertion, nearest neighbors, and the most efficient,\nnearest neighbor with a caliper, in order to limit the error percentage and\nstandard mean deviation. Only testing these techniques on a data set that\nincluded patients treated with semaglutide makes it not possible to\ndefinitively state which technique is the best.

    "abstract": "In this work, we present novel randomized compression algorithms for flat\nrank-structured matrices with shared bases, known as uniform Block Low-Rank\n(BLR) matrices. Our main contribution is a technique called tagging, which\nimproves upon the efficiency of basis matrix computation while preserving\naccuracy compared to alternative methods. Tagging operates on the matrix using\nmatrix-vector products of the matrix and its adjoint, making it particularly\nadvantageous in scenarios where accessing individual matrix entries is\ncomputationally expensive or infeasible.\n  Flat rank-structured formats use subblock sizes that asymptotically scale\nwith the matrix size to ensure competitive complexities for linear algebraic\noperations, making alternative methods prohibitively expensive in such\nscenarios. In contrast, tagging reconstructs basis matrices using a constant\nnumber of matrix-vector products followed by linear post-processing, with the\nconstants determined by the rank parameter and the problem's underlying\ngeometric properties.\n  We provide a detailed analysis of the asymptotic complexity of tagging,\ndemonstrating its ability to significantly reduce computational costs without\nsacrificing accuracy. We also establish a theoretical connection between the\noptimal construction of tagging matrices and projective varieties in algebraic\ngeometry, suggesting a hybrid numeric-symbolic avenue of future work.\n  To validate our approach, we apply tagging to compress uniform BLR matrices\narising from the discretization of integral and partial differential equations.\nEmpirical results show that tagging outperforms alternative compression\ntechniques, significantly reducing both the number of required matrix-vector\nproducts and overall computational time. These findings highlight the\npracticality and scalability of tagging as an efficient method for flat\nrank-structured matrices in scientific computing.",

In this work, we focus on the problem of automatically\nsynthesizing fault-tolerant circuits for the deterministic initialization of an\nencoded state for a broad class of quantum codes that are realizable on current\nand near-term hardware.\n  To this end, we utilize methods based on techniques from classical circuit\ndesign, such as satisfiability solving, resulting in tools for the synthesis of\n(optimal) fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for near-term quantum\ncodes.

    "abstract": "Motor execution, a fundamental aspect of human behavior, has been extensively\nstudied using BCI technologies. EEG and fNIRS have been utilized to provide\nvaluable insights, but their individual limitations have hindered performance.\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of fusing electroencephalography\n(EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data for classifying\nrest versus task states in a motor execution paradigm. Using the SMR Hybrid BCI\ndataset, this work compares unimodal (EEG and fNIRS) classifiers with a\nmultimodal fusion approach. It proposes Motor Execution using Convolutional\nAdditive Self-Attention Mechanisms (MECASA), a novel architecture leveraging\nconvolutional operations and self-attention to capture complex patterns in\nmultimodal data. MECASA, built upon the CAS-ViT architecture, employs a\ncomputationally efficient, convolutional-based self-attention module (CASA), a\nhybrid block design, and a dedicated fusion network to combine features from\nseparate EEG and fNIRS processing streams. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat MECASA consistently outperforms established methods across all modalities\n(EEG, fNIRS, and fused), with fusion consistently improving accuracy compared\nto single-modality approaches. fNIRS generally achieved higher accuracy than\nEEG alone. Ablation studies revealed optimal configurations for MECASA, with\nembedding dimensions of 64-128 providing the best performance for EEG data and\nOD128 (upsampled optical density) yielding superior results for fNIRS data.\nThis work highlights the potential of deep learning, specifically MECASA, to\nenhance EEG-fNIRS fusion for BCI applications.",

It is based on the working knowledge and best practices\ndeveloped by the Access Network, a collection of nine student-led communities\nat universities across the country working towards a vision of a more diverse,\nequitable, inclusive, and accessible STEM environment. Many of these\ncommunities, also referred to as sites, include a near-peer mentoring program\nthat is developed to best support their local context. The format of these\nprograms vary, ranging from structured classes with peer mentoring groups to\nstudent clubs supporting 1-on-1 relationships. To further support program\nparticipants as both students and as whole people, sites often run additional\nevents such as lecture series, workshops, and social activities guided tailored\nto each student community's needs. Through this process, student leaders have\ngenerated and honed best practices for all aspects of running their sites. This\nguide is an attempt to synthesize those efforts, offering practical advice for\nstudent leaders setting up near-peer mentorship programs in their own\ndepartments.

We compute atmospheric structures\nthat self-consistently account for condensate cloud opacities based on\nmicrophysical properties. We present an algorithm based on control theory to\nhelp converge such self-consistent models. Synthetic atmosphere spectra are\ncomputed for each model to explore the observable impact of the cloud\nmicrophysics. We additionally explore the impact of choosing different\nnucleation species (TiO$_2$ or SiO) and the effect of less efficient\natmospheric mixing on these spectra. The new MSG cloudy grid using TiO$_2$\nnucleation shows spectra which are redder in the near-infrared compared to the\ncurrently known population of substellar atmospheres. We find the models with\nSiO nucleation, and models with reduced mixing efficiency are less red in the\nnear-infrared.

In total, eighteen sources\nwere observed: the main science targets, Sgr A* and M87 along with various\ncalibrators. We investigated the morphology of the sixteen AGN in the EHT 2017\ndata set, focusing on the properties of the VLBI cores: size, flux density, and\nbrightness temperature. We studied their dependence on the observing frequency\nin order to compare it with the Blandford-K\\\"onigl (BK) jet model. We modeled\nthe source structure of seven AGN in the EHT 2017 data set using linearly\npolarized circular Gaussian components and collected results for the other nine\nAGN from dedicated EHT publications, complemented by lower frequency data in\nthe 2-86 GHz range. Then, we studied the dependences of the VLBI core flux\ndensity, size, and brightness temperature on the frequency measured in the AGN\nhost frame. We compared the observations with the BK jet model and estimated\nthe magnetic field strength dependence on the distance from the central black\nhole. Our results indicate a deviation from the standard BK model, particularly\nin the decrease of the brightness temperature with the observing frequency.\nEither bulk acceleration of the jet material, energy transfer from the magnetic\nfield to the particles, or both are required to explain the observations.",

High\nangular resolution ALMA observations allow deep kinematical analysis of disks,\nby observing molecular line emission at high spectral resolution. In\nparticular, rotation curves are key tools for studying the disk pressure\nstructure and estimating fundamental disk parameters, such as mass and radius.\nIn this work, we explore the potential of a multi-molecule approach to gas\nkinematics to provide a 2D characterization of the HD 163296 disk. From the\nhigh quality data of the MAPS Large Program we extracted the rotation curves of\nrotational lines from seven distinct molecular species, spanning a wide radial\nand vertical range. To obtain reliable rotation curves for hyperfine lines, we\nextended standard methodologies to fit multi-component line profiles. We then\nsampled the likelihood of a thermally stratified model that reproduces all the\nrotation curves simultaneously, taking into account the molecular emitting\nlayers and disk thermal structure. We obtained dynamical estimates of the\nstellar mass $M_\\star=1.89$ M$_\\odot$, the disk mass $M_\\text{d}=0.12$\nM$_\\odot$, and scale radius $R_\\text{c}=143$ au. We also explore how rotation\ncurves and the parameter estimates depend on the adopted emitting layers: the\ndisk mass proves to be the most affected by these systematics, yet the main\ntrends we find do not depend on the adopted parameterization. Finally, we\ninvestigated the impact of thermal structure on gas kinematics, showing that\nthe thermal stratification can efficiently explain the measured rotation\nvelocity discrepancies between tracers at different heights. Our results show\nthat such a multi-molecule approach, tracing a large range of emission layers,\ncan provide unique constraints on the ($R,z$) pressure structure of\nprotoplanetary disks.",

To properly engineer such sources, a reliable model describing\nnano- and micrometer-scale SPDC is necessary; however, such a theoretical\ndescription remains a challenge. Here, we propose and derive a simplified model\nto describe SPDC in resonant structures, which considers the generation of\nphoton pairs and the resonant enhancement of spectral bands to be separate\nprocesses, even though they actually occur simultaneously. We compare our\nsimplified model to both the rigorous theory of SPDC in an etalon - a simple\nexample of a resonant structure - and our experiments on SPDC in etalons and\nfind agreement for low-gain SPDC. By simplifying the calculations required to\ngenerate photon pairs, our model promises to make designing complex resonant\nstructures easier, and it promises to hasten the iteration of designs across\nthe field of quantum state engineering.",

We use new James Webb Space Telescope\n(JWST) NIRCam imaging to study the morphologies and sizes of NLRs traced by [O\nIII] at cosmic noon ($z\\sim2-3$). To determine NIRCam's ability to probe the\nproperties of the NLR in cosmic noon galaxies, we present simulated images of\nAGN at $z=2-3$ created with archival data cubes from the Multi Unit\nSpectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) of nine nearby ($z<0.05$) AGN host galaxies with\npreviously confirmed extended NLRs. Our simulated images show that NIRCam is\nable to resolve the morphologies of NLRs at $z=2-3$ with narrow- and\nmedium-band observations. We then search for extended NLRs with NIRCam\nmedium-band observations targeting the [O III]$+\\mathrm{H}\\beta$ emission in\ntwenty-seven previously identified AGN at $z=2.4-3.4$ in the Great\nObservatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field. We detect six galaxies\nin our observed sample with [O III]$+\\mathrm{H}\\beta$ morphologies consistent\nwith AGN ionization cones with characteristic NLR sizes of $1-2.5$ kpc. Thanks\nto our simulated data, we can predict the effects of cosmological surface\nbrightness dimming and instrument noise on the NLR size measurements at high\nredshift, which has the biasing effect of lowering the NLR size-AGN luminosity\ntrend that is observed at low redshift by a factor of $\\sim 2$.",

We robustly measure the field-integrated ICM velocity dispersion to be\nsigma_v = 169 +/- 10 km/s, obtaining similar results for both\nsingle-temperature and two-temperature plasma models to account for the cluster\ncool core. This result, if ascribed to isotropic turbulence, implies a subsonic\nICM with Mach number M_3D = 0.22 and a non-thermal pressure fraction of\n2.6+/-0.3%. The turbulent velocity is similar to what was measured in the core\nof the Perseus cluster by Hitomi, but here in a more massive cluster with an\nICM temperature of 7 keV, the limit on non-thermal pressure fraction is even\nmore stringent. Our result is consistent with expectations from simulations of\nrelaxed clusters, but it is on the low end of the predicted distribution,\nindicating that Abell 2029 is an exceptionally relaxed cluster with no\nsignificant impacts from either a recent minor merger or AGN activity.",

    "abstract": "Temporal Awareness, the ability to reason dynamically based on the timestamp\nwhen a question is raised, is the key distinction between offline and online\nvideo LLMs. Unlike offline models, which rely on complete videos for static,\npost hoc analysis, online models process video streams incrementally and\ndynamically adapt their responses based on the timestamp at which the question\nis posed. Despite its significance, temporal awareness has not been adequately\nevaluated in existing benchmarks. To fill this gap, we present OVO-Bench\n(Online-VideO-Benchmark), a novel video benchmark that emphasizes the\nimportance of timestamps for advanced online video understanding capability\nbenchmarking. OVO-Bench evaluates the ability of video LLMs to reason and\nrespond to events occurring at specific timestamps under three distinct\nscenarios: (1) Backward tracing: trace back to past events to answer the\nquestion. (2) Real-time understanding: understand and respond to events as they\nunfold at the current timestamp. (3) Forward active responding: delay the\nresponse until sufficient future information becomes available to answer the\nquestion accurately. OVO-Bench comprises 12 tasks, featuring 644 unique videos\nand approximately human-curated 2,800 fine-grained meta-annotations with\nprecise timestamps. We combine automated generation pipelines with human\ncuration. With these high-quality samples, we further developed an evaluation\npipeline to systematically query video LLMs along the video timeline.\nEvaluations of nine Video-LLMs reveal that, despite advancements on traditional\nbenchmarks, current models struggle with online video understanding, showing a\nsignificant gap compared to human agents. We hope OVO-Bench will drive progress\nin video LLMs and inspire future research in online video reasoning. Our\nbenchmark and code can be accessed at https://github.com/JoeLeelyf/OVO-Bench.",

Two light curve dips were\nobserved; during them, the harder Comptonized spectral component was dominant\nand the polarization degree higher than in the softer, off-dip intervals.\nThrough a joint analysis of the three IXPE observations, which also included\nthe dip from the first observation, we demonstrate that the polarization\nproperties varied in response to the intensity and spectral hardness changes\nassociated with the dips. The polarization degree attained values up to ~4%.\nThe polarization angle showed a swing of ~70{\\deg} across the dip and off-dip\nstates, comparable to the continuous rotation seen during the first IXPE\nobservation. We discuss these results in the context of models for polarized\nemission from the accretion disk and the boundary/spreading layer on the\nneutron star surface. We also draw attention to the role that an extended\naccretion disk corona or disk wind can play in generating high polarization\ndegrees and, possibly, swings of the polarization angle.",

Particularly, highly eccentric\ncompanion stars risk disrupting planetary orbits, such as in the extreme system\nTOI 4633 where close encounters between the companion and a gas giant planet in\nthe habitable zone make it one of the most fragile systems discovered so far.\nHere, we report that TOI 4633's planet likely survived these encounters\nthroughout the system's age by orbiting retrograde relative to the binary,\nstabilised by the Coriolis force. Using direct $N$-body simulations, we show it\notherwise tends to collide with the binary stars or becomes free-floating after\ngetting ejected. A retrograde planetary orbit has profound implications for TOI\n4633's formation and evolution, suggesting an extraordinary history where its\neccentric companion was likely randomly captured after planet formation in a\nsingle-star system. Alternatively, if stars and planet are born in situ from\nthe same gas clump, we show the planet must have formed at sub-snow-line\ndistances, contrary to the conventional core-accretion model. Our study\nhighlights the importance of considering the long-term stability ($\\gtrsim\\rm\nGyr$) of planets in eccentric binaries and demonstrates that the mere existence\nin such dynamically hostile environments places strong constraints on their\norbital configuration and formation.",

In this work, we introduce ReFocus, a simple yet\neffective framework that equips multimodal LLMs with the ability to generate\n\"visual thoughts\" by performing visual editing on the input image through code,\nshifting and refining their visual focuses. Specifically, ReFocus enables\nmultimodal LLMs to generate Python codes to call tools and modify the input\nimage, sequentially drawing boxes, highlighting sections, and masking out\nareas, thereby enhancing the visual reasoning process. We experiment upon a\nwide range of structured image understanding tasks involving tables and charts.\nReFocus largely improves performance on all tasks over GPT-4o without visual\nediting, yielding an average gain of 11.0% on table tasks and 6.8% on chart\ntasks. We present an in-depth analysis of the effects of different visual\nedits, and reasons why ReFocus can improve the performance without introducing\nadditional information. Further, we collect a 14k training set using ReFocus,\nand prove that such visual chain-of-thought with intermediate information\noffers a better supervision than standard VQA data, reaching a 8.0% average\ngain over the same model trained with QA pairs and 2.6% over CoT.",

Our method\ntrains a set of expert diffusion models over partitions of the dataset, each in\nfull isolation from one another. At inference time, the experts ensemble\nthrough a lightweight router.

In the helical\nsuperconductor, such an altermagnet can induce a topological phase transition\ninto a gapless topological superconductor hosting Majorana flat edge modes. On\nthe other hand, in the chiral superconductor, the topological transition takes\nplace between a topologically nontrivial gapped phase and a gapless nodal-line\nsuperconductor, where the Bogoliubov quasiparticle bands intersect at an\nisolated line in momentum space. Remarkably, we show that when such an\naltermagnet is coupled to a mixed-pairing superconductor, with both chiral and\nhelical components, a hybrid topological phase emerges, featuring dispersive\nMajorana edge modes that coexist with nearly flat Majorana edge states.

Many MDE models aim to predict affine-invariant\nrelative depth from monocular images, while recent developments in large-scale\ntraining and vision foundation models enable reasonable estimation of metric\n(absolute) depth. However, effectively leveraging these predictions for\ngeometric vision tasks, in particular relative pose estimation, remains\nrelatively under explored. While depths provide rich constraints for cross-view\nimage alignment, the intrinsic noise and ambiguity from the monocular depth\npriors present practical challenges to improving upon classic keypoint-based\nsolutions. In this paper, we develop three solvers for relative pose estimation\nthat explicitly account for independent affine (scale and shift) ambiguities,\ncovering both calibrated and uncalibrated conditions. We further propose a\nhybrid estimation pipeline that combines our proposed solvers with classic\npoint-based solvers and epipolar constraints. We find that the affine\ncorrection modeling is beneficial to not only the relative depth priors but\nalso, surprisingly, the \"metric\" ones. Results across multiple datasets\ndemonstrate large improvements of our approach over classic keypoint-based\nbaselines and PnP-based solutions, under both calibrated and uncalibrated\nsetups. We also show that our method improves consistently with different\nfeature matchers and MDE models, and can further benefit from very recent\nadvances on both modules.

    "abstract": "The ability to organically reason over and with both text and images is a\npillar of human intelligence, yet the ability of Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) to perform such multimodal reasoning remains under-explored.\nExisting benchmarks often emphasize text-dominant reasoning or rely on shallow\nvisual cues, failing to adequately assess integrated visual and textual\nreasoning. We introduce EMMA (Enhanced MultiModal reAsoning), a benchmark\ntargeting organic multimodal reasoning across mathematics, physics, chemistry,\nand coding. EMMA tasks demand advanced cross-modal reasoning that cannot be\naddressed by reasoning independently in each modality, offering an enhanced\ntest suite for MLLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our evaluation of\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs on EMMA reveals significant limitations in handling\ncomplex multimodal and multi-step reasoning tasks, even with advanced\ntechniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and test-time compute scaling\nunderperforming. These findings underscore the need for improved multimodal\narchitectures and training paradigms to close the gap between human and model\nreasoning in multimodality.",

However, extending state-of-the-art video tokenizers to achieve a\ntemporal compression ratio beyond 4x without increasing channel capacity poses\nsignificant challenges. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to\nenhance temporal compression. We find that the reconstruction quality of\ntemporally subsampled videos from a low-compression encoder surpasses that of\nhigh-compression encoders applied to original videos. This indicates that\nhigh-compression models can leverage representations from lower-compression\nmodels. Building on this insight, we develop a bootstrapped\nhigh-temporal-compression model that progressively trains high-compression\nblocks atop well-trained lower-compression models. Our method includes a\ncross-level feature-mixing module to retain information from the pretrained\nlow-compression model and guide higher-compression blocks to capture the\nremaining details from the full video sequence. Evaluation of video benchmarks\nshows that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality while\nincreasing temporal compression compared to directly training the full model.\nFurthermore, the resulting compact latent space effectively trains a video\ndiffusion model for high-quality video generation with a significantly reduced\ntoken budget.",

The inclusion\ncriteria targeted peer-reviewed papers published between 2020 and 2024. Papers\nwere screened for relevance to Neuro-Symbolic AI, with further inclusion based\non the availability of associated codebases to ensure reproducibility.\n  Results: From an initial pool of 1,428 papers, 167 met the inclusion criteria\nand were analyzed in detail.

Specifically, given $N$ independent random points\n$x_1,\\ldots,x_N$ in $\\mathbb{R}^D$ and a parameter $\\alpha \\in (0, 1)$ such\nthat each $x_i$ is drawn from a Gaussian with mean $\\mu$ and unknown\ncovariance, and an unknown $\\alpha$-fraction of the points have\nidentity-bounded covariances, the goal is to estimate the common mean $\\mu$.\nThe one-dimensional version of this task has received significant attention in\ntheoretical computer science and statistics over the past decades. Recent work\n[LY20; CV24] has given near-optimal upper and lower bounds for the\none-dimensional setting. On the other hand, our understanding of even the\ninformation-theoretic aspects of the multivariate setting has remained limited.\n  In this work, we design a computationally efficient algorithm achieving an\ninformation-theoretically near-optimal error. Specifically, we show that the\noptimal error (up to polylogarithmic factors) is $f(\\alpha,N) + \\sqrt{D/(\\alpha\nN)}$, where the term $f(\\alpha,N)$ is the error of the one-dimensional problem\nand the second term is the sub-Gaussian error rate. Our algorithmic approach\nemploys an iterative refinement strategy, whereby we progressively learn more\naccurate approximations $\\hat \\mu$ to $\\mu$. This is achieved via a novel\nrejection sampling procedure that removes points significantly deviating from\n$\\hat \\mu$, as an attempt to filter out unusually noisy samples. A complication\nthat arises is that rejection sampling introduces bias in the distribution of\nthe remaining points. To address this issue, we perform a careful analysis of\nthe bias, develop an iterative dimension-reduction strategy, and employ a novel\nsubroutine inspired by list-decodable learning that leverages the\none-dimensional result.",

To our knowledge, even the\nNewtonian part within this setup is novel. Building on this, we also include,\nup to second order in perturbation theory, the dynamical general relativistic\nand radiation effects, together with the leading relativistic projection\neffects. For simplicity, we neglect tracer bias and line-of-sight integrated\ncontributions, however note that in particular the former can be\nstraightforwardly incorporated within our framework. We evaluate the bispectrum\ncontributions for two redshift bins, $1.75 \\leq z \\leq 2.25$ and $0.55 \\leq z\n\\leq 0.65$, and compare our theoretical prediction against relativistic\nlight-cone simulations, with line-of-sight integral effects removed so as to\nenable direct consistency checks. As expected, we find that the Newtonian\ncontributions are typically one or more orders of magnitudes larger than the\nrelativistic signal across the entire spectrum for both redshifts. At $z=2$, we\nfind that projection and dynamical relativistic effects have comparable\namplitudes on large scales; somewhat unexpectedly, however, radiation effects\ndominate the relativistic signal in the squeezed limit. At $z=0.6$, the\nexpected hierarchy is recovered, though dynamical corrections remain\nnon-negligible -- only a factor of 2-3 smaller than projection effects.

We introduce LongProc (Long Procedural Generation), a new\nbenchmark that requires both the integration of highly dispersed information\nand long-form generation. LongProc consists of six diverse procedural\ngeneration tasks, such as extracting structured information from HTML pages\ninto a TSV format and executing complex search procedures to create travel\nplans. These tasks challenge LCLMs by testing their ability to follow detailed\nprocedural instructions, synthesize and reason over dispersed information, and\ngenerate structured, long-form outputs (up to 8K tokens). Furthermore, as these\ntasks adhere to deterministic procedures and yield structured outputs, they\nenable reliable rule-based evaluation. We evaluated 23 LCLMs, including\ninstruction-tuned models and recent reasoning models, on LongProc at three\ndifficulty levels, with the maximum number of output tokens set at 500, 2K, and\n8K. Notably, while all tested models claim a context window size above 32K\ntokens, open-weight models typically falter on 2K-token tasks, and\nclosed-source models like GPT-4o show significant degradation on 8K-token\ntasks. Reasoning models achieve stronger overall performance in long-form\ngeneration, benefiting from long CoT training.

This results in programs with several nested loops and dynamic\ndata dependencies between tensors. While DL systems with eager execution\nsupport such dynamism, they lack the optimizations and smart scheduling of\ngraph-based execution. Graph-based execution, however, cannot express dynamic\ntensor shapes, instead requiring the use of multiple static subgraphs. Either\nexecution model for DRL thus leads to redundant computation, reduced\nparallelism, and less efficient memory management.\n  We describe TimeRL, a system for executing dynamic DRL programs that combines\nthe dynamism of eager execution with the whole-program optimizations and\nscheduling of graph-based execution. TimeRL achieves this by introducing the\ndeclarative programming model of recurrent tensors, which allows users to\ndefine dynamic dependencies as intuitive recurrence equations. TimeRL\ntranslates recurrent tensors into a polyhedral dependence graph (PDG) with\ndynamic dependencies as symbolic expressions. Through simple PDG\ntransformations, TimeRL applies whole-program optimizations, such as automatic\nvectorization, incrementalization, and operator fusion. The PDG also allows for\nthe computation of an efficient program-wide execution schedule, which decides\non buffer deallocations, buffer donations, and GPU/CPU memory swapping. We show\nthat TimeRL executes current DRL algorithms up to 47$\\times$ faster than\nexisting DRL systems, while using 16$\\times$ less GPU peak memory.",

Initial calculations were\nperformed to achieve results applicable to any quantum system subjected to\nrules analogous to those used in classical thermal machine studies. These\nresults were then used to analyze two-level quantum systems as the working\nmedium of QTMs in the Otton cycle. In particular, we analyzed two specific\nquantum systems: the laser and a spinless electron in a one-dimensional quantum\nring, yielding consistent and innovative results.

Specifically, the Bagging Optimized Dynamic Mode\nDecomposition (BOP-DMD), is leveraged to learn stable, reduced order models of\nthe interaction between the spheromak plasma formed in the confinement volume,\nand the injector circuits of the device. BOP-DMD is trained and evaluated on an\nanalytic model of the vacuum dynamics of the injector circuits of HIT-SIU, as\nwell as an analytic linear reduced-order model for the injector dynamics when a\nplasma is present.

    "abstract": "In lattice field theory, field sparsening aims to replace quantum fields, or\nobjects constructed from them, with approximations that preserve the\nappropriate symmetries and maintain many aspects of the physics that the fields\ndetermine. For example, an effective sparsening of a quark propagator provides\nan efficient map from a quark propagator on a fine lattice geometry to a quark\npropagator defined on a coarser geometry in order to reduce storage and\ncomputational costs of subsequent calculational stages while maintaining\nlong-distance correlations and corresponding low-energy physical information.\nPrevious studies have focused on decimating lattice sites or randomly sampling\nlattice sites to reduce the size of the propagator and subsequent costs of Wick\ncontractions. Here, we extend the study of sparsening to incorporate covariant\naveraging of spatial sites and examine the effects on two-point and three-point\ncorrelation functions involving various hadrons. We find that sparsening is\nmost effective in reproducing the unsparsened versions of these correlation\nfunctions when weighted covariant-averaging is sequentially applied many times.",

The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is a key\nmechanism for angular momentum transport and large-scale magnetic field\namplification. Recent work has begun to address the regime of high magnetic\nPrandtl number $\\mathrm{Pm}$, the ratio of viscosity to resistivity, in which\nangular momentum and magnetic energy increase with $\\mathrm{Pm}$. This regime\nreveals unique dynamics of small-scale turbulence in disk mid-planes and\nbuoyancy instabilities in the atmosphere. This study aims to build on these\nfindings, focusing on the MRI-driven $\\alpha\\Omega$ dynamo in stratified\nsimulations to understand magnetic field generation in the high-$\\mathrm{Pm}$\nregime. We analyze data taken from stratified shearing box simulations both in\nthe regime of magnetic Prandtl number of order unity, and also in the high\n$\\mathrm{Pm}$ regime employing new techniques to compute the dynamo\ncoefficients. We find that the mean-magnetic field evolution can be described\nby an $\\alpha\\Omega$ dynamo, even in the high-Pm regime. The mean magnetic\nfield as well as the dynamo coefficients increase with Pm. This leads to a\nshorter dynamo period and a faster growth rate. We also find that the\noff-diagonal coefficients have an impact on the propagation of the magnetic\nfield in the dynamo region. Overall, the magnetic field amplification found in\nglobal simulations should be increased by at least a factor of $\\sim 5$, which\ncould lead to more powerful jets and stronger winds from astrophysical disks in\nthe high-Pm regime.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the transport feature of an inertial chiral active\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck particle moving on a two-dimensional surface. Using both\nanalytical approach and numerical simulations, we have exactly explored the\ntransient and steady-state behavior of the particle by analyzing the simulated\nparticle trajectories, probability distribution functions for position and\nvelocity, mean square displacement, mean square velocity, and effective kinetic\ntemperature of the medium. From the mean square displacement calculations, we\nobserve that, unlike an inertial active Brownian particle, a chiral active\nparticle manifests an initial ballistic, intermediate sub-diffusive to\nnon-diffusive, and the conventional long-time diffusive behavior. The\nintermediate sub-diffusive to non-diffusive behavior is prominent for the\nself-propulsion of an overdamped particle. It can be understood by\nchirality-induced transient confinement, which persists for short time\nintervals and diffuses away in the time asymptotic limit or at the steady\nstate. This behavior is further complemented by the exact calculation of mean\nsquare velocity or effective kinetic temperature of the medium, which is a\ndecreasing function of the magnitude of chirality. Moreover, the steady-state\nMSD and MSV are found to have a dependence both on chirality and activity time\nscale and hence can be controlled by tuning the persistent duration of activity\nor strength of the chirality of the particle.",

For such problems, we introduce the dual\nmatrix-valued variational formulation in the spirit of [Y. Brenier. Comm. Math.\nPhys. (2018) 364(2) 579-605]. Employing time-adaptive weights, we are able to\nprove consistency of the duality scheme on large time intervals. We also prove\nsolvability of the dual problem in the corresponding anisotropic Orlicz spaces.\nAs an application, we show that no subsolution of the PDEs that fit into our\nframework is able to dissipate the total entropy earlier or faster than the\nstrong solution on the interval of existence of the latter. This result (we\ncall it Dafermos' principle) is new even for \"isotropic\" problems such as the\nincompressible Euler system.",

Our method combines and\nextends speed-up techniques used in previous scenario addition methods (also\ncalled column-and-constraint generation methods) and introduces several new\ntechniques. In particular, it uses dual bounds for second-stage problems in\norder to allow a faster identification of the next promising scenario to be\nadded to the master problem. Moreover, adaptive time limits are imposed to\navoid getting stuck on particularly hard second-stage problems, and a gap\npropagation between master problem and second-stage problems is used to stop\nsolving them earlier if only a given non-zero optimality gap is to be reached\noverall. This makes our method particularly effective for problems where\nsolving the second-stage problem is computationally challenging. To evaluate\nthe method's performance, we compare it to two recent scenario addition methods\nfrom the literature on two applications: a robust capacitated location routing\nproblem and a robust integrated berth allocation and quay crane assignment and\nscheduling problem. The first problem features a particularly hard second\nstage, and we show that our method is able to solve considerably more and\nlarger instances in a given time limit.

    "abstract": "Numerous distributed tasks have to be handled in a setting where a fraction\nof nodes behaves Byzantine, that is, deviates arbitrarily from the intended\nprotocol. Resilient, deterministic protocols rely on the detection of\nmajorities to avoid inconsistencies if there is a Byzantine minority, which\nrequires individual nodes to handle a communication workload that is\nproportional to the size of the network -- an intolerable disadvantage in large\nnetworks. Randomized protocols circumvent this by probing only small parts of\nthe network, thus allowing for consistent decisions quickly and with a high\nlevel of confidence with communication that is near-constant in the network\nsize. However, such protocols usually come with the drawback of limiting the\nfault tolerance of the protocol, for instance, by severely restricting the\nnumber or type of failures that the protocol can tolerate. We present\nrandomized protocols to reliably aggregate and broadcast information, form\nconsensus and compute common coins that tolerate a constant fraction of\nByzantine failures, do not require cryptographic signatures and have a\nnear-constant time and message complexity per node. Our main technique is to\ncompute a system of witness committees as a pre-computation step almost\noptimally.

Notably, the Weyl semimetal supports non-reciprocal superconductivity\nand a Bogoliubov-Fermi surface, potentially providing a novel framework for\nrealizing the superconducting diode effect.

When the underlying\nreward function is not linear, existing linear bandits work usually relies on a\nuniform misspecification parameter $\\epsilon$ that measures the sup-norm error\nof the best linear approximation. This results in an unavoidable linear regret\nwhenever $\\epsilon > 0$. We propose a more natural model of misspecification\nwhich only requires the approximation error at each input $x$ to be\nproportional to the suboptimality gap at $x$. It captures the intuition that,\nfor optimization problems, near-optimal regions should matter more and we can\ntolerate larger approximation errors in suboptimal regions.\n  Quite surprisingly, we show that the classical LinUCB algorithm -- designed\nfor the realizable case -- is automatically robust against such\n$\\rho$-gap-adjusted misspecification with parameter $\\rho$ diminishing at\n$O(1/(d \\sqrt{\\log T}))$. It achieves a near-optimal $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret for\nproblems that the best-known regret is almost linear in time horizon $T$. We\nfurther advance this frontier by presenting a novel phased elimination-based\nalgorithm whose gap-adjusted misspecification parameter $\\rho = O(1/\\sqrt{d})$\ndoes not scale with $T$.

It has been\nsuggested that uncertainty over the human preferences acts to keep the agents\ncorrigible, even in the face of human irrationality. We present a general\nframework for modelling corrigibility in a multi-agent setting as a 2 player\ngame in which the agents always have a move in which they can ask the human for\nsupervision. This is formulated as a Bayesian game for the purpose of\nintroducing uncertainty over the human beliefs. We further analyse two specific\ncases. First, a two player corrigibility game, in which we want corrigibility\ndisplayed in both agents for both common payoff (monotone) games and harmonic\ngames. Then we investigate an adversary setting, in which one agent is\nconsidered to be a `defending' agent and the other an `adversary'. A general\nresult is provided for what belief over the games and human rationality the\ndefending agent is required to have to induce corrigibility.",

This raises concerns about the potential abuse of\nimage generation, such as the creation of explicit or violent images, commonly\nreferred to as Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content. To address this, the Stable\nDiffusion model includes several safety checkers to censor initial text prompts\nand final output images generated from the model.

The remanent\npolarization increases with film thickness, reflecting enhanced domain\nstability, while endurance cycles highlight the wake-up effect and its eventual\ndegradation due to fatigue in thicker films.

Identifying the incoherent noise\nof a quantum device in addition to its coherent interactions is, however, as\nessential.

    "abstract": "On the main sequence, the asteroseismic small frequency separation\n$\\delta\\nu_{02}$ between radial and quadrupole p-modes is customarily\ninterpreted to be a direct diagnostic of internal structure. Such an\ninterpretation is based on a well-known integral estimator relating\n$\\delta\\nu_{02}$ to a radially-averaged sound-speed gradient. However, this\nestimator fails, catastrophically, when evaluated on structural models of red\ngiants: their small separations must therefore be interpreted differently. We\nderive a single expression which both reduces to the classical estimator when\napplied to main-sequence stellar models, yet reproduces the qualitative\nfeatures of the small separation for stellar models of very evolved red giants.\nThis expression indicates that the small separations of red giants scale\nprimarily with their global seismic properties as $\\delta\\nu_{02} \\propto\n\\Delta\\nu^2/\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$, rather than being in any way sensitive to their\ninternal structure. Departures from this asymptotic behaviour, during the\ntransition from the main-sequence to red giant regimes, have been recently\nreported in open-cluster Christensen-Dalsgaard (C-D) diagrams from K2 mission\ndata. Investigating them in detail, we demonstrate that they occur when the\nconvective envelope boundary passes a specific acoustic distance -- roughly a\nthird of a wavelength at $\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$ -- from the centre of the star, at\nwhich point radial modes become maximally sensitive to the position of the\nboundary. The shape of the corresponding features on $\\epsilon_p$ and C-D (or\n$r_{02}$) diagrams may be useful in constraining the nature of convective\nboundary mixing, in the context of undershooting beneath a convective envelope.",

However,\neffectively automating the design process across the vast search space of those\nthree dimensions poses significant challenges, especially when pursuing\nextremely low-bit quantization. Specifical, the primary challenges include: (1)\nMemory overhead in software-side: Low-precision quantization-aware training can\nlead to significant memory usage due to storing large intermediate features and\nlatent weights for back-propagation, potentially causing memory exhaustion. (2)\nSearch time-consuming in hardware-side: The discrete nature of hardware\nparameters and the complex interplay between compiler optimizations and\nindividual operators make the accelerator search time-consuming. To address\nthese issues, JAQ mitigates the memory overhead through a channel-wise sparse\nquantization (CSQ) scheme, selectively applying quantization to the most\nsensitive components of the model during optimization. Additionally, JAQ\ndesigns BatchTile, which employs a hardware generation network to encode all\npossible tiling modes, thereby speeding up the search for the optimal compiler\nmapping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of JAQ,\nachieving approximately 7% higher Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet compared to\nprevious methods and reducing the hardware search time per iteration to 0.15\nseconds.",

    "abstract": "Prototype-based federated learning has emerged as a promising approach that\nshares lightweight prototypes to transfer knowledge among clients with data\nheterogeneity in a model-agnostic manner. However, existing methods often\ncollect prototypes directly from local models, which inevitably introduce\ninconsistencies into representation learning due to the biased data\ndistributions and differing model architectures among clients. In this paper,\nwe identify that both statistical and model heterogeneity create a vicious\ncycle of representation inconsistency, classifier divergence, and skewed\nprototype alignment, which negatively impacts the performance of clients. To\nbreak the vicious cycle, we propose a novel framework named Federated Learning\nvia Semantic Anchors (FedSA) to decouple the generation of prototypes from\nlocal representation learning. We introduce a novel perspective that uses\nsimple yet effective semantic anchors serving as prototypes to guide local\nmodels in learning consistent representations. By incorporating semantic\nanchors, we further propose anchor-based regularization with margin-enhanced\ncontrastive learning and anchor-based classifier calibration to correct feature\nextractors and calibrate classifiers across clients, achieving intra-class\ncompactness and inter-class separability of prototypes while ensuring\nconsistent decision boundaries. We then update the semantic anchors with these\nconsistent and discriminative prototypes, which iteratively encourage clients\nto collaboratively learn a unified data representation with robust\ngeneralization. Extensive experiments under both statistical and model\nheterogeneity settings show that FedSA significantly outperforms existing\nprototype-based FL methods on various classification tasks.",

In our generalized setting, each\nmiller can freely choose any location for setting up a mill, while each baker\nis restricted in the choice of location for setting up a bakery. For optimal\nbargaining power, a baker would like to select a location with many millers to\nbuy flour from and with little competition from other bakers. Likewise, a\nmiller aims for a location with many bakers and few competing millers. Thus,\nboth types of agents choose locations to optimize the ratio of agents of\nopposite type divided by agents of the same type at their chosen location.\nOriginally raised in the context of Fractional Hedonic Games, the Bakers and\nMillers Game has applications that range from commerce to product design.\n  We study the impact of location restrictions on the properties of the game.\nWhile pure Nash equilibria trivially exist in the setting without location\nrestrictions, we show via a sophisticated, efficient algorithm that even the\nmore challenging restricted setting admits equilibria. Moreover, the computed\nequilibrium approximates the optimal social welfare by a factor of at most\n$2\\left(\\frac{e}{e-1}\\right)$. Furthermore, we give tight bounds on the price\nof anarchy/stability.\n  On the conceptual side, the location choice feature adds a new layer to the\nstandard setting of Hedonic Games, in the sense that agents that select the\nsame location form a coalition. This allows to naturally restrict the possible\ncoalitions that can be formed. With this, our model generalizes simple\nsymmetric Fractional Hedonic Games on complete bipartite valuation graphs and\nalso Hedonic Diversity Games with utilities single-peaked at 0. We believe that\nthis generalization is also a very interesting direction for other types of\nHedonic Games.",

Specifically, they proved\nthat in the agnostic setting, only finite hypothesis classes are globally\nstable learnable. Therefore, agnostic global stability is too restrictive to\ncapture interesting hypothesis classes.\n  To address this limitation, Chase et al. introduced two relaxations of\nagnostic global stability. In this paper, we characterize the classes that are\nlearnable under their proposed relaxed conditions, resolving the two open\nproblems raised in their work.\n  First, we prove that in the setting where the stability parameter can depend\non the excess error (the gap between the learner's error and the best\nachievable error by the hypothesis class), agnostic stability is fully\ncharacterized by the Littlestone dimension. Consequently, as in the realizable\ncase, this form of learnability is equivalent to online learnability.\n  As part of the proof of this theorem, we strengthen the celebrated result of\nBun et al. by showing that classes with infinite Littlestone dimension are not\nstably PAC learnable, even if we allow the stability parameter to depend on the\nexcess error.\n  For the second relaxation proposed by Chase et al., we prove that only finite\nhypothesis classes are globally stable learnable, even if we restrict the\nagnostic setting to distributions with small population loss.",

The method results from the combination of the force partitioning method\n(Menon and Mittal, J. Fluid Mech., 907:A37, 2021) and modal decomposition\ntechniques such as Reynolds decomposition, triple decomposition, and proper\northogonal decomposition, and is applied here to three distinct flows -\ntwo-dimensional flows past a circular cylinder and an airfoil, and the\nthree-dimensional flow over a revolving rectangular wing. We show that the\nforce partitioning method applied to modal decomposition of velocity fields\nresults in complex, and difficult to interpret inter-modal interactions. We\ntherefore propose and apply modal decomposition directly to the $Q$-field\nassociated with these flows. The variable $Q$ is a non-linear observable that\nis typically used to identify vortices in a flow, and we find that the direct\ndecomposition of $Q$ leads to results that are more amenable to interpretation.\nWe also demonstrate that this modal force partitioning can be extended to\nprovide insights into the far-field aeroacoustic loading noise of these flows.",

However,\nquantifying superlubricity across the vast four-dimensional heterodeformation\nspace using experiments or atomic-scale simulations is a challenging task. In\nthis work, we develop an atomically informed dynamic Frenkel--Kontorova (DFK)\nmodel for predicting the interface friction drag coefficient of an arbitrarily\nheterodeformed bilayer graphene (BG) system. The model is motivated by MD\nsimulations of friction in heterodeformed BG. In particular, we note that\ninterface dislocations formed during structural relaxation translate in unison\nwhen a heterodeformed BG is subjected to shear traction, leading us to the\nhypothesis that the kinetic properties of interface dislocations determine the\nfriction drag coefficient of the interface. The constitutive law of the DFK\nmodel comprises the generalized stacking fault energy of the AB stacking, a\nscalar displacement drag coefficient, and the elastic properties of graphene,\nwhich are all obtained from atomistic simulations. Simulations of the DFK model\nconfirm our hypothesis since a single choice of the displacement drag\ncoefficient, fit to the kinetic property of an individual dislocation in an\natomistic simulation, predicts interface friction in any heterodeformed BG. By\nbridging the gap between dislocation kinetics at the microscale to interface\nfriction at the macroscale, the DFK model enables a high-throughput\ninvestigation of strain-engineered vdW heterostructures.",

Our system integrates the\npost-processing for QKD and QOT, both sharing a single physical layer, ensuring\nefficient key generation and authentication. Authentication involves hashing\nmessages into a crypto-context, verifying tags, and replenishing keys through a\nparallel QKD pipeline, which handles both key post-processing and\nauthentication. Oblivious keys are generated over 12.9 km with a channel loss\nof 8.47 dB. In a back-to-back setup, a QOT rate of $9.3\\times10^{-3}$\nOTs/second is achieved, corresponding to 1 minute and 48 seconds per OT,\nprimarily limited by the entanglement source. Using pre-distributed keys\nimproved the rate to 0.11 OTs/second, or 9.1 seconds per OT. The considered QOT\nprotocol is statistically correct, computationally secure for an honest\nreceiver, and statistically secure for an honest sender, assuming a\ncomputationally hiding, statistically binding commitment, and a verifiable\nerror-correcting scheme. A practical use case is demonstrated for\nprivacy-preserving fingerprint matching against no-fly lists from Interpol and\nthe United Nations. The fingerprint is secret-shared across two sites, ensuring\nsecurity, while the matching is performed using the MASCOT protocol, supported\nby QOT.

Previous studies have primarily\nfocused on topological bands with conventional s-wave pairing. However,\ntopological Dirac semimetals exhibiting a unique orbital texture can favor\nunconventional pairing when electronic correlations are significant. The\ntopology of vortices in these systems has yet to be explored. In this work, we\ninvestigate the vortex bound states in superconducting Dirac semimetals, with a\nparticular focus on the orbital-singlet unconventional pairing, which generates\nhigher-order Majorana hinge modes. Remarkably, we identify robust double\nMajorana vortex flat bands at zero energy. In type-I Dirac semimetals, these\nMajorana flat bands are located between the projections of two superconduting\nDirac points.

We combine\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with a fast model of radial drift to\ndetermine the birth gas mass and characteristic radius of the disc, and compare\nour results against observations and models in the literature; we find the\nbirth-condition disc gas mass to be\n$\\log_{10}(M_{\\rm{disc}}/M_{\\odot})=-0.64^{+0.19}_{-0.24}$ and the\ncharacteristic radius to be\n$\\log_{10}(r_{\\rm{c}}/\\rm{AU})=2.30^{+0.45}_{-0.46}$.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models\nhave been a dominant type of model architectures to enable large models\nnowadays, with parallel expert networks. Serving large MoE models on serverless\ncomputing is potentially beneficial, but has been underexplored due to\nsubstantial challenges in handling the skewed expert popularity and\nscatter-gather communication bottleneck in MoE model execution, for\ncost-efficient serverless MoE deployment and performance guarantee. We study\noptimized MoE model deployment and distributed inference serving on a\nserverless platform, that effectively predict expert selection, pipeline\ncommunication with model execution, and minimize the overall billed cost of\nserving MoE models. Especially, we propose a Bayesian optimization framework\nwith multi-dimensional epsilon-greedy search to learn expert selections and\noptimal MoE deployment achieving optimal billed cost, including: 1) a Bayesian\ndecision-making method for predicting expert popularity; 2) flexibly pipelined\nscatter-gather communication; and 3) an optimal model deployment algorithm for\ndistributed MoE serving. Extensive experiments on AWS Lambda show that our\ndesigns reduce the billed cost of all MoE layers by at least 75.67% compared to\nCPU clusters while maintaining satisfactory inference throughput.

This problem arises naturally in a variety of contexts including model\nselection, hypothesis testing, and within many DP algorithms. Classical\nmethods, such as Report Noisy Max (RNM), assume all candidates' scores are\nequally sensitive to changes in a single individual's data, but this often\nisn't the case. To address this, algorithms like the Generalised Exponential\nMechanism (GEM) leverage variability in candidate sensitivities. However, we\nobserve that while these algorithms can outperform RNM in some situations, they\nmay underperform in others - they can even perform worse than random selection.\nIn this work, we explore how the distribution of scores and sensitivities\nimpacts DP selection mechanisms. In all settings we study, we find that there\nexists a mechanism that utilises heterogeneity in the candidate sensitivities\nthat outperforms standard mechanisms like RNM. However, no single mechanism\nuniformly outperforms RNM. We propose using the correlation between the scores\nand sensitivities as the basis for deciding which DP selection mechanism to\nuse. Further, we design a slight variant of GEM, modified GEM that generally\nperforms well whenever GEM performs poorly.

Although\nthese shrinkage approaches provide well-conditioned precision matrix estimates,\nthey do not explicitly address the uncertainty associated with these estimated\nmatrices.

However, the microscopic\ntransient processes remain unclear, motivating this paper. Using 2D fluid\nmodels, we investigate SF6 streamer breakdown induced by a floating linear\nmetal particle under negative applied voltage. First, We identify a\ncharacteristic double-end streamer inception in the combined gap. Then, we\npropose the following streamer (FS) mechanism to explain the metal particle's\nrole. Two following streamers, FS1 and FS2, arise from the interaction between\nspace charge and metal particle. FS1 facilitates breakdown via the negative\nspace charge field generated by its head. FS2 facilitates breakdown by merging\nwith FS1, accelerating its propagation and enhancing the electric field at the\nprimary streamer head. Finally, we propose the side streamer (SS) mechanism to\nexplain the nonlinear breakdown behavior of high-pressure SF6. The SS is\nidentified as a new forward ionization wave that develops along the sides of\nthe primary streamer, due to photoionization-driven negative ion accumulation.\nSS facilitates breakdown by merging with the primary streamer, increasing\nnegative space charge and leading to three distinct propagation modes. Higher\npressure increases the production rate of negative ions along the streamer\nsides, making SS more likely to form. Under overvoltage, the facilitating\neffect of SS diminishes as the background field (E/N)b strengthens,\ndisappearing when (E/N)b exceeds 245 Td.

In this\nstudy, we simulate the follow-up multi-band light curve monitoring for glSNe Ia\nsystems, which are expected to be firstly discovered by the Chinese Survey\nSpace Telescope (CSST). Our results show that with \\(300s \\times 9\\) exposures\nin each epoch, MOST can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of approximately\n50 for the brightest images of glSNe Ia, while even the faintest images\nmaintain an SNR of at least 7. Using a standard SNe Ia light curve template for\nfitting, we measured the time delays. With a 2-day cadence, MOST achieves a\ntime delay error of only a few hours, with the bias typically remaining below\none hour. This study highlights the capability of MOST to significantly advance\nthe precision of time delay measurements, offering a promising path toward\nresolving the Hubble tension.",

    "abstract": "We develop signal capture and analysis techniques for precisely extracting\nand characterizing the frame timing of the Starlink constellation's Ku-band\ndownlink transmissions. The aim of this work is to determine whether Starlink\nframe timing has sufficient short-term stability to support pseudorange-based\nopportunistic positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT). A second goal is to\ndetermine whether frame timing is disciplined to a common time scale such as\nGPS time. Our analysis reveals several timing characteristics not previously\nknown that carry strong implications for PNT. On the favorable side, periods of\nns-level jitter in frame arrival times across all satellite versions indicate\nthat Starlink hardware is fundamentally capable of the short-term stability\nrequired to support GPS-like PNT. But there are several unfavorable\ncharacteristics that, if not addressed, will make GPS-like PNT impractical: (1)\nThe v1.0 and v1.5 Starlink satellites exhibit once-per-second abrupt frame\ntiming adjustments whose magnitude (as large as 100s of ns) and sign appear\nunpredictable. Similar discontinuities are also present in the v2.0-Mini frame\ntiming, though smaller and irregularly spaced. (2) Episodic 15-s periods of\nhigh frame jitter routinely punctuate the nominal low-jitter frame arrival\ntiming. (3) Starlink frame timing is disciplined to GPS time, but only loosely:\nto within a few ms by adjustments occurring every 15 s; otherwise exhibiting\ndrift that can exceed 20 ppm. These unfavorable characteristics are essentially\nincompatible with accurate PNT. Fortunately, they appear to be a consequence of\nsoftware design choices, not hardware limitations. Moreover, they could be\ncompensated with third-party-provided corrections.",

We formulate the problem by considering a canonical shear flow\nwith a hyperbolic-tangent profile. We perform linear stability analysis on this\nbase flow using both numerical and asymptotic\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) methods. Two types of instabilities\nare identified and explored: inflectional instability, which occurs in the\npresence of an inflection point in shear flow, and inertial instability due to\nan imbalance between the centrifugal acceleration and pressure gradient. Both\ninstabilities are promoted as thermal diffusion becomes stronger or\nstratification becomes weaker. Effects of the full Coriolis acceleration are\nfound to be more complex according to parametric investigations in wide ranges\nof colatitudes and rotation-to-shear and rotation-to-stratification ratios.\nAlso, new prescriptions for the vertical eddy viscosity are derived to model\nthe turbulent transport triggered by each instability.

It is found that the energy of stable\nhopfions is always below the energy of the $2\\pi$-skyrmion lattice in the same\nmaterial, suggesting the possibility to use $2\\pi$-skyrmions as a precursor for\nhopfion nucleation. Stability diagram for hopfions on the magnetic\nanisotropy-field phase diagram is computed numerically. Explicit analytical\nexpressions for some of its critical lines are derived.",

The\nvisual complexity of web pages is known to influence search behavior, with\nprevious work suggesting that searchers make evaluative judgments within the\nfirst second on a page. However, there is a significant gap in our\nunderstanding of how visual complexity impacts searches specifically conducted\nwith a learning intent. This gap is particularly relevant for the development\nof optimized information retrieval (IR) systems that effectively support\neducational objectives. To address this research need, we model visual\ncomplexity and aesthetics via a diverse set of features, investigating their\nrelationship with search behavior during learning-oriented web sessions. Our\nstudy utilizes a publicly available dataset from a lab study where participants\nlearned about thunderstorm formation. Our findings reveal that while content\nrelevance is the most significant predictor for knowledge gain, sessions with\nless visually complex pages are associated with higher learning success. This\nobservation applies to features associated with the layout of web pages rather\nthan to simpler features (e.g., number of images). The reported results shed\nlight on the impact of visual complexity on learning-oriented searches,\ninforming the design of more effective IR systems for educational contexts.

Here we show that POT allows for the comprehensive\nexperimental identification of all molecular orbitals in a substantial binding\nenergy range, in the present case more than 10 eV. Making use of the angular\ndistribution of photoelectrons as a function of binding energy, we exemplify\nthis by extracting orbital-resolved partial densities of states (pDOS) for 15\n$\\pi$ and 23 $\\sigma$ orbitals from the experimental photoemission intensities\nof the prototypical organic molecule bisanthene (C$_{28}$H$_{14}$) on a Cu(110)\nsurface. In their entirety, these experimentally measured orbital-resolved pDOS\nfor an essentially complete set of orbitals serve as a stringent benchmark for\nelectronic structure methods, which we illustrate by performing density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations employing four frequently-used\nexchange-correlation functionals. By computing the respective\nmolecular-orbital-projected densities of states of the bisanthene/Cu(110)\ninterface, a one-to-one comparison with experimental data for an unprecedented\nnumber of 38 orbital energies becomes possible. The quantitative analysis of\nour data reveals that the range-separated hybrid functional HSE performs best\nfor the investigated organic/metal interface. At a more fundamental level, the\nremarkable agreement between the experimental and the Kohn-Sham orbital\nenergies over a binding energy range larger than 10\\,eV suggests that --\nperhaps unexpectedly -- Kohn-Sham orbitals approximate Dyson orbitals, which\nwould rigorously account for the electron extraction process in photoemission\nspectroscopy but are notoriously difficult to compute, in a much better way\nthan previously thought.",

A powerful\ntool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced\nin the late 1980's. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence\nbased methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments.\nAfter a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the\nrecurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the\nquantification of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantification\nanalysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the\ndynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences\nto dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence\nsuggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system's\nbehaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to\ncoupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction.\nThis fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of\nsynchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several\napplications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth\nsciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to\nprovide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot\nbased methods in their own field of research.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for\nsuborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization.\nInitially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine,\nthrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design\npurposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles\nattitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the\naltitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal\n(downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the\nnon-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov\nstability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the\ninner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output\ntracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference\ntracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The\nzero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the\nouterloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral\naction, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In\nthe outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty\nis indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known\naerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is\nproven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a\nsingle-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference\nvehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to\nverify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to\ntrack the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances.\nFurthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission\nscenarios is minimal to none.",

To improve our\nunderstanding of the non-thermal processes occurring in the pulsar wind nebula,\nwe attempted to determine the possible existence of a radio counterpart, study\nits morphology, and obtain restrictive upper limits of the pulsar and filament\nemission at radio wavelengths. We performed observations of the pulsar PSR\nJ2030+4415 and its surroundings with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope (uGMRT) at two frequency bands, and put the results in context with\nfindings at other wavelengths.

A\nphysical scenario that combines the radio and the X-ray observations, and\nconsistent with IR data, of the nebula and the filament is presented.

    "abstract": "We introduce a model of simple type theory with potential infinite carrier\nsets. The functions in this model are automatically continuous, as defined in\nthis paper. This notion of continuity does not rely on topological concepts,\nincluding domain theoretic concepts, which essentially use actual infinite\nsets. The model is based on the concept of a factor system, which generalizes\ndirect and inverse systems. A factor system is basically an extensible set\nindexed over a directed set of stages, together with a predecessor relation\nbetween object states at different stages.\n  The function space, when considered as a factor system, expands\nsimultaneously with its elements. On the one hand, the space is subdivided more\nand more, on the other hand, the elements increase and are defined more and\nmore precisely. In addition, a factor system allows the construction of limits\nthat are part of its expansion process and not outside of it. At these limits,\nelements are indefinitely large or small, which is a contextual notion and a\nsubstitute for elements that are infinitely large or small (points). This\ndynamic and contextual view is consistent with an understanding of infinity as\na potential infinite.",

The raw dataset (6907 daytime observations, 5-10 min\nresolution) includes the number of cows in the shade, ambient temperature and\nrelative humidity.

    "abstract": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify a mix of known and\nnovel categories within unlabeled data sets, providing a more realistic setting\nfor image recognition. Essentially, GCD needs to remember existing patterns\nthoroughly to recognize novel categories. Recent state-of-the-art method SimGCD\ntransfers the knowledge from known-class data to the learning of novel classes\nthrough debiased learning. However, some patterns are catastrophically forgot\nduring adaptation and thus lead to poor performance in novel categories\nclassification. To address this issue, we propose a novel learning approach,\nLegoGCD, which is seamlessly integrated into previous methods to enhance the\ndiscrimination of novel classes while maintaining performance on previously\nencountered known classes. Specifically, we design two types of techniques\ntermed as Local Entropy Regularization (LER) and Dual-views Kullback Leibler\ndivergence constraint (DKL). The LER optimizes the distribution of potential\nknown class samples in unlabeled data, thus ensuring the preservation of\nknowledge related to known categories while learning novel classes. Meanwhile,\nDKL introduces Kullback Leibler divergence to encourage the model to produce a\nsimilar prediction distribution of two view samples from the same image. In\nthis way, it successfully avoids mismatched prediction and generates more\nreliable potential known class samples simultaneously. Extensive experiments\nvalidate that the proposed LegoGCD effectively addresses the known category\nforgetting issue across all datasets, eg, delivering a 7.74% and 2.51% accuracy\nboost on known and novel classes in CUB, respectively.

Despite extensive theoretical\nwork, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with\nconflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured\nthe pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified\nmodels. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close\ncompetition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as\nwell as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a\nmulti-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states.

These\nspin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a\nsuperconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model\nparameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the\nabsence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration\nand superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate\nspin-fluctuations.",

A brute force discretization of structural as well as\nvolumetric parts using well-shaped three-dimensional elements may be accurate,\nbut leads to problems of enormous computational complexity even for simple\nmodels.

However,\nattackers may steal those valuable RAGs and deploy or commercialize them,\nmaking it essential to detect Intellectual Property (IP) infringement. Most\nexisting ownership protection solutions, such as watermarks, are designed for\nrelational databases and texts. They cannot be directly applied to RAGs because\nrelational database watermarks require white-box access to detect IP\ninfringement, which is unrealistic for the knowledge base in RAGs. Meanwhile,\npost-processing by the adversary's deployed LLMs typically destructs text\nwatermark information. To address those problems, we propose a novel black-box\n\"knowledge watermark\" approach, named RAG-WM, to detect IP infringement of\nRAGs. RAG-WM uses a multi-LLM interaction framework, comprising a Watermark\nGenerator, Shadow LLM & RAG, and Watermark Discriminator, to create watermark\ntexts based on watermark entity-relationship tuples and inject them into the\ntarget RAG. We evaluate RAG-WM across three domain-specific and two\nprivacy-sensitive tasks on four benchmark LLMs. Experimental results show that\nRAG-WM effectively detects the stolen RAGs in various deployed LLMs.\nFurthermore, RAG-WM is robust against paraphrasing, unrelated content removal,\nknowledge insertion, and knowledge expansion attacks.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their exceptional performance\nin various complex code generation tasks. However, their broader adoption is\nlimited by significant computational demands and high resource requirements,\nparticularly memory and processing power. To mitigate such requirements, model\npruning techniques are used to create more compact models with significantly\nfewer parameters. However, current approaches do not focus on the efficient\nextraction of programming-language-specific sub-models. In this work, we\nexplore the idea of efficiently deriving coding-specific sub-models through\nunstructured pruning (i.e., Wanda). We investigate the impact of different\ndomain-specific calibration datasets on pruning outcomes across three distinct\ndomains and extend our analysis to extracting four language-specific\nsub-models: Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. We are the first to efficiently\nextract programming-language-specific sub-models using appropriate calibration\ndatasets while maintaining acceptable accuracy w.r.t. full models. We are also\nthe first to provide analytical evidence that domain-specific tasks activate\ndistinct regions within LLMs, supporting the creation of specialized sub-models\nthrough unstructured pruning. We believe that this work has significant\npotential to enhance LLM accessibility for coding by reducing computational\nrequirements to enable local execution on consumer-grade hardware, and\nsupporting faster inference times critical for real-time development feedback.",

    "abstract": "Optical computing offers potential for ultra high-speed and low latency\ncomputation by leveraging the intrinsic properties of light. Here, we explore\nthe use of highly nonlinear optical fibers (HNLFs) as platforms for optical\ncomputing based on the concept of Extreme Learning Machines. Task-independent\nevaluations are introduced to the field for the first time and focus on the\nfundamental metrics of effective dimensionality and consistency, which we\nexperimentally characterize for different nonlinear and dispersive conditions.\nWe show that input power and fiber characteristics significantly influence the\ndimensionality of the computational system, with longer fibers and higher\ndispersion producing up to 100 principal components (PCs) at input power levels\nof 30 mW, where the PC correspond to the linearly independent dimensions of the\nsystem. The spectral distribution of the PC's eigenvectors reveals that the\nhigh-dimensional dynamics facilitating computing through dimensionality\nexpansion are located within 40~nm of the pump wavelength at 1560~nm, providing\ngeneral insight for computing with nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation systems.\nTask-dependent results demonstrate the effectiveness of HNLFs in classifying\nMNIST dataset images. Using input data compression through PC analysis, we\ninject MNIST images of various input dimensionality into the system and study\nthe impact of input power upon classification accuracy. At optimized power\nlevels we achieve a classification test accuracy of 88\\%, significantly\nsurpassing the baseline of 83.7\\% from linear systems. Noteworthy, we find that\nbest performance is not obtained at maximal input power, i.e. maximal system\ndimensionality, but at more than one order of magnitude lower. The same is\nconfirmed regarding the MNIST image's compression, where accuracy is\nsubstantially improved when strongly compressing the image to less than 50 PCs.",

However, the full transformative\npotential of molecular intercalation remains underexplored, largely due to the\nlack of simple, broadly applicable methods that preserve high crystalline\nquality down to the few-layer limit. Here, we introduce a simple galvanic\napproach to intercalate different molecules into various vdW materials under\nambient conditions, leveraging the low reduction potential of selected metals\nto enable a spontaneous molecular insertion.

Notably, intercalation leads to\na molecule-dependent enhancement of the superconducting transition in 2H-TaS2,\nreaching a critical temperature of 4.7 K, higher than TaS2 monolayers.\nAdditionally, RuCl3 exhibits an unprecedented transition from antiferromagnetic\nto ferrimagnetic ordering upon intercalation with cobaltocenium.

To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel strategy to enhance zero-shot OOD detection performances for both Far-OOD\nand Near-OOD scenarios by innovatively harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs)\nand VLMs. Our approach first exploit an LLM to generate superclasses of the ID\nlabels and their corresponding background descriptions followed by feature\nextraction using CLIP.

The refined\nrepresentation facilitates the selection of more appropriate negative labels\nfor OOD data from a comprehensive candidate label set of WordNet, thereby\nenhancing the performance of zero-shot OOD detection in both scenarios.\nFurthermore, we introduce novel few-shot prompt tuning and visual prompt tuning\nto adapt the proposed framework to better align with the target distribution.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently\noutperforms current state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, with\nan improvement of up to 2.9% in AUROC and a reduction of up to 12.6% in FPR95.\nAdditionally, our method exhibits superior robustness against covariate shift\nacross different domains, further highlighting its effectiveness in real-world\nscenarios.",

Neural network\nmodels show remarkable performance compared with statistical models; however,\nthey are often criticized for their lack of transparency and interoperability.\nThe proposed RUM-NN is introduced in both linear and nonlinear structures. The\nlinear RUM-NN retains the interpretability and identifiability of traditional\neconometric discrete choice models while using neural network-based estimation\ntechniques. The nonlinear RUM-NN extends the model's flexibility and predictive\ncapabilities to capture nonlinear relationships between variables within\nutility functions. Additionally, the RUM-NN allows for the implementation of\nvarious parametric distributions for unobserved error components in the utility\nfunction and captures correlations among error terms. The performance of RUM-NN\nin parameter recovery and prediction accuracy is rigorously evaluated using\nsynthetic datasets through Monte Carlo experiments. Additionally, RUM-NN is\nevaluated on the Swissmetro and the London Passenger Mode Choice (LPMC)\ndatasets with different sets of distribution assumptions for the error\ncomponent. The results demonstrate that RUM-NN under a linear utility structure\nand IID Gumbel error terms can replicate the performance of the Multinomial\nLogit (MNL) model, but relaxing those constraints leads to superior performance\nfor both Swissmetro and LPMC datasets.

    "abstract": "In scenarios where multiple decision-makers operate within a common decision\nspace, each focusing on their own multi-objective optimization problem (e.g.,\nbargaining games), the problem can be modeled as a multi-party multi-objective\noptimization problem (MPMOP). While numerous evolutionary algorithms have been\nproposed to solve MPMOPs, most results remain empirical. This paper presents\nthe first theoretical analysis of the expected runtime of evolutionary\nalgorithms on bi-party multi-objective optimization problems (BPMOPs). Our\nfindings demonstrate that employing traditional multi-objective optimization\nalgorithms to solve MPMOPs is both time-consuming and inefficient, as the\nresulting population contains many solutions that fail to achieve consensus\namong decision-makers. An alternative approach involves decision-makers\nindividually solving their respective optimization problems and seeking\nconsensus only in the final stage. While feasible for pseudo-Boolean\noptimization problems, this method may fail to guarantee approximate\nperformance for one party in NP-hard problems. Finally, We propose\ncoevolutionary multi-party multi-objective optimizers (CoEMPMO) for\npseudo-Boolean optimization and shortest path problems within a multi-party\nmulti-objective context, which maintains a common solution set among all\nparties through coevolution. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed \\( \\text{CoEMPMO}_{\\text{random}} \\) outperforms previous\nalgorithms in terms of the expected lower bound on runtime for pseudo-Boolean\noptimization problems. Additionally, \\(\n\\text{CoEMPMO}_{\\text{cons}}^{\\text{SP}} \\) achieves better efficiency and\nprecision in solving shortest path problems compared to existing algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely used to visualize neural\nnetwork decisions, yet their underlying mechanisms remain incompletely\nunderstood. To enhance the understanding of CAM methods and improve their\nexplainability, we introduce the Content Reserved Game-theoretic (CRG)\nExplainer. This theoretical framework clarifies the theoretical foundations of\nGradCAM and HiResCAM by modeling the neural network prediction process as a\ncooperative game. Within this framework, we develop ShapleyCAM, a new method\nthat leverages gradients and the Hessian matrix to provide more precise and\ntheoretically grounded visual explanations. Due to the computational\ninfeasibility of exact Shapley value calculation, ShapleyCAM employs a\nsecond-order Taylor expansion of the cooperative game's utility function to\nderive a closed-form expression. Additionally, we propose the Residual Softmax\nTarget-Class (ReST) utility function to address the limitations of pre-softmax\nand post-softmax scores. Extensive experiments across 12 popular networks on\nthe ImageNet validation set demonstrate the effectiveness of ShapleyCAM and its\nvariants. Our findings not only advance CAM explainability but also bridge the\ngap between heuristic-driven CAM methods and compute-intensive Shapley\nvalue-based methods.

    "abstract": "Proximity ferroelectricity has recently been reported as a new design\nparadigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar\nmaterial becomes a ferroelectric by interfacing with a thin ferroelectric\nlayer. Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO, which were previously\nunswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown fields,\ncan now be switched with practical coercive fields when they are in intimate\nproximity to a switchable ferroelectric. Here, we develop a general\nLandau-Ginzburg theory of proximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of\nnon-ferroelectrics and ferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and\ncoercive fields. The theory predicts regimes of both \"proximity switching\"\nwhere the multilayers collectively switch, as well as \"proximity suppression\"\nwhere they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximity\nferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by the polarization\nof the layers and their relative thickness in a self-consistent manner that\nrenormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of\nthe switching barrier. Further reduction in the coercive field emerges from\ncharged defects in the bulk that act as nucleation centers. The application of\nthe theory to proximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO\nbilayers is demonstrated. The theory further predicts that multilayers of\ndielectric/ferroelectric and paraelectric/ferroelectric layers can potentially\nresult in induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric or paraelectric layers,\nresulting in the entire stack being switched, an exciting avenue for new\ndiscoveries. This thawing of \"frozen ferroelectrics\", paraelectrics and\npotentially dielectrics, promises a large class of new ferroelectrics with\nexciting prospects for previously unrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic\nand memory technologies.",

Therefore, characterization and study of the interfacial\nproperties of InSb/CdTe heterojunctions are crucial for the growth improvement\nof the InSb/CdTe material system as well as its application in the field of\nspintronics. In this study, a novel scanning probe microscope, called a\nscanning noise microscope, was applied to visualize hot electron scattering in\nInSb/CdTe nano-devices. The results demonstrated that the near-field signal\noriginates from the Coulomb scattering of charged ions on electrons at the\ninterface of the embedded layer heterojunction. This real-space, nondestructive\ncharacterization of the heterojunction interface properties offers a new tool\nfor enhancing the performance of heterojunctions.",

    "abstract": "Communication has been widely employed to enhance multi-agent collaboration.\nPrevious research has typically assumed delay-free communication, a strong\nassumption that is challenging to meet in practice. However, real-world agents\nsuffer from channel delays, receiving messages sent at different time points,\ntermed {\\it{Asynchronous Communication}}, leading to cognitive biases and\nbreakdowns in collaboration. This paper first defines two communication delay\nsettings in MARL and emphasizes their harm to collaboration. To handle the\nabove delays, this paper proposes a novel framework, Communication\nDelay-tolerant Multi-Agent Collaboration (CoDe). At first, CoDe learns an\nintent representation as messages through future action inference, reflecting\nthe stable future behavioral trends of the agents. Then, CoDe devises a dual\nalignment mechanism of intent and timeliness to strengthen the fusion process\nof asynchronous messages. In this way, agents can extract the long-term intent\nof others, even from delayed messages, and selectively utilize the most recent\nmessages that are relevant to their intent. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat CoDe outperforms baseline algorithms in three MARL benchmarks without\ndelay and exhibits robustness under fixed and time-varying delays.",

The thresholdless interaction of coherent elastic scattering\nof neutrinos on atomic nuclei leads to greatly enhanced interaction rates,\nwhich allows for much smaller detectors. The study of this process gives\ninsights into physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The CONUS+\nexperiment was designed to first detect elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering in\nthe fully coherent regime with low-energy neutrinos produced in nuclear\nreactors. For this purpose, semi-conductor detectors based on high-purity\ngermanium crystals with extremely low-energy thresholds were developed.

In 119 days of reactor operation\n(395$\\pm$106) neutrinos were measured compared with a predicted number from\ncalculations assuming Standard Model physics of (347$\\pm$59) events.

To leverage advancements and\novercome the limitations of drones in providing intra-city express services, we\nintroduce a coordinated drone-courier logistics system where drones operate\nwithin a closed network among vertiports, while couriers connect customers to\nthe drone delivery system. This paper aims to shed light on this coordinated\nsystem in terms of system feasibility, network interactivity, and long-term\nsustainability. Methodology/Results: We develop an integrated optimization\nmodel to optimize the network planning of the coordinated logistics system. The\ninterplay between network planning and tactical operations is mirrored by a\nqueueing network model, resulting in the nonlinear and nonconvex (partially\nconvex and partially concave) feasible region of the optimization model. An\niterative exact algorithm that tightens lower and upper bounds by adaptively\nrefining the linear approximations of nonlinear constraints is developed to\nprovide optimality-guaranteed solutions with finite convergence.

Predicting the\nformation of such skin layer or particle shell and its properties is a crucial\nproblem for applications and constitutes a multi-scale problem, from the\nmicro/nanoscopic scale of the particles to the millimetric size of the\ndroplets. Interestingly, its physical description lies at the interface between\ndeterministic macroscopic evaporation models and microscopic stochastic\nparticles interactions and diffusion.

This approach is compared successfully to numerical solutions obtained\nusing a finite element solver in the limit of high P\\'eclet numbers, and to 2D\nBrownian dynamics simulations. Our results show that the concentration profiles\nand shell formation onset depend nontrivially on the initial packing fraction.\nBy analyzing these profiles, we determine the position where the glassy layer\nforms, whose formation is expected to play a critical role in shell buckling.\nThis model provides a robust framework for predicting the size and maximum\naspect ratio of the resulting clusters.",

In this work, we present an approach that\nsystematically derives symbolic expressions for these higher-order derivatives,\nbypassing the numerical instabilities commonly encountered in conventional\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at visual understanding, but face\nefficiency challenges due to quadratic complexity in processing long\nmulti-modal contexts. While token compression can reduce computational costs,\nexisting approaches are designed for single-view LVLMs and fail to consider the\nunique multi-view characteristics of high-resolution LVLMs with dynamic\ncropping. Existing methods treat all tokens uniformly, but our analysis reveals\nthat global thumbnails can naturally guide the compression of local crops by\nproviding holistic context for informativeness evaluation. In this paper, we\nfirst analyze dynamic cropping strategy, revealing both the complementary\nnature between thumbnails and crops, and the distinctive characteristics across\ndifferent crops. Based on our observations, we propose \"Global Compression\nCommander\" (GlobalCom$^2$), a novel plug-and-play token compression framework\nfor HR-LVLMs. GlobalCom$^2$ leverages thumbnail as the \"commander\" to guide the\ncompression of local crops, adaptively preserving informative details while\neliminating redundancy. Extensive experiments show that GlobalCom$^2$ maintains\nover 90% performance while compressing 90% visual tokens, reducing FLOPs and\npeak memory to 9.1% and 60%.

Current metrics, such as BLEU,\nprimarily rely on lexical similarity between generated and reference reviews.\nHowever, such metrics tend to underestimate reviews that articulate the\nexpected issues in ways different from the references. In this paper, we\nexplore how semantic similarity between generated and reference reviews can\nenhance the automated assessment of code reviews. We first present a benchmark\ncalled \\textit{GradedReviews}, which is constructed by collecting real-world\ncode reviews from open-source projects, generating reviews using\nstate-of-the-art approaches, and manually assessing their quality. We then\nevaluate existing metrics for code review assessment using this benchmark,\nrevealing their limitations. To address these limitations, we propose two novel\nsemantic-based approaches for assessing code reviews. The first approach\ninvolves converting both the generated review and its reference into digital\nvectors using a deep learning model and then measuring their semantic\nsimilarity through Cosine similarity. The second approach generates a prompt\nbased on the generated review and its reference, submits this prompt to\nChatGPT, and requests ChatGPT to rate the generated review according to\nexplicitly defined criteria. Our evaluation on the \\textit{GradedReviews}\nbenchmark indicates that the proposed semantic-based approaches significantly\noutperform existing state-of-the-art metrics in assessing generated code\nreview, improving the correlation coefficient between the resulting scores and\nhuman scores from 0.22 to 0.47.",

    "abstract": "Most stars form in dense clusters within high-mass star-forming regions,\nwhere protoplanetary disks may be exposed to intense UV radiation from nearby\nmassive stars. While previous studies have typically focused on isolated\nsources in low-mass regions, recent observational campaigns have started to\nprobe the chemistry of irradiated disks in unprecedented detail. Interpreting\nthis data requires complex chemical models, yet few studies have examined these\ndisks' chemistry, and none have incorporated the photoevaporative wind launched\nby external UV fields into their physical structure. In this study, we\npost-process radiation hydrodynamics simulations of externally irradiated\nprotoplanetary disks using the thermochemical code DALI, comparing models with\nand without the wind to assess its impact on disk chemistry. Results show that\nUV radiation is rapidly attenuated by the disk in both cases. However, thermal\nre-emission from the wind at longer wavelengths enhances disk heating,\nincreasing the gas-phase abundances of some key volatiles. Synthetic line\nfluxes vary by orders of magnitude between wind and windless models, primarily\ndue to emission from the wind itself rather than abundance variations within\nthe disk. Our findings demonstrate that the photoevaporative wind significantly\ninfluences the physical and chemical structure, and observational\ncharacteristics, of externally irradiated disks. We conclude that incorporating\nthe wind into chemical models is essential for accurately predicting chemical\nabundances, interpreting observations, and ultimately understanding planet\nformation in these common yet complex environments.",

In this work, the coarse-graining\nMulti-Particle Collision Dynamics (MPCD) framework is applied to three active\nparticle models to produce mesoscale simulations of polar active fluids. The\nfirst active-polar MPCD (AP-MPCD) is a variant of the Vicsek model, while the\nsecond and third variants allow the speed of the particles to relax towards a\nself-propulsion speed subject to Andersen and Langevin thermostats,\nrespectively.

We\nleverage the mesoscale nature of AP-MPCD to explore flocking in the presence of\nexternal fields, which destroys banding, and anisotropic obstacles, which act\nas a ratchet that biases the flocking direction.

Secure software engineering (SSE) must continuously address\nvulnerabilities that endanger software systems and carry broader socio-economic\nrisks, such as compromising critical national infrastructure and causing\nsignificant financial losses. Researchers and practitioners have explored\nmethodologies like Static Application Security Testing Tools (SASTTs) and\nartificial intelligence (AI) approaches, including machine learning (ML) and\nlarge language models (LLMs), to detect and mitigate these vulnerabilities.\nEach method has unique strengths and limitations.\n  Aim. This thesis seeks to bring order to the chaos in SSE by addressing\ndomain-specific differences that impact AI accuracy.\n  Methodology. The research employs a mix of empirical strategies, such as\nevaluating effort-aware metrics, analyzing SASTTs, conducting method-level\nanalysis, and leveraging evidence-based techniques like systematic dataset\nreviews. These approaches help characterize vulnerability prediction datasets.\n  Results. Key findings include limitations in static analysis tools for\nidentifying vulnerabilities, gaps in SASTT coverage of vulnerability types,\nweak relationships among vulnerability severity scores, improved defect\nprediction accuracy using just-in-time modeling, and threats posed by untouched\nmethods.\n  Conclusions. This thesis highlights the complexity of SSE and the importance\nof contextual knowledge in improving AI-driven vulnerability and defect\nprediction. The comprehensive analysis advances effective prediction models,\nbenefiting both researchers and practitioners.",

Existing Bio-RE methods struggle\nwith cross-sentence inference, which is essential for capturing relations\nspanning multiple sentences. Moreover, previous methods often overlook the\nincompleteness of documents and lack the integration of external knowledge,\nlimiting contextual richness. Besides, the scarcity of annotated data further\nhampers model training. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)\nhave inspired us to explore all the above issues for document-level Bio-RE.\nSpecifically, we propose a document-level Bio-RE framework via LLM Adaptive\nDocument-Relation Cross-Mapping (ADRCM) Fine-Tuning and Concept Unique\nIdentifier (CUI) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). First, we introduce the\nIteration-of-REsummary (IoRs) prompt for solving the data scarcity issue.

Finally,\nduring the inference, a biomedical-specific RAG approach, named CUI RAG, is\ndesigned to leverage CUIs as indexes for entities, narrowing the retrieval\nscope and enriching the relevant document contexts.

Lucky imaging, in combination with\nspeckle suppression and a covariance analysis, can allow the resolution of\nmultiple point sources below the diffraction limit of 2-m class telescopes.\nHowever, it should be noted that measurements in the super-resolution regime\nare less sensitive than those above the first Airy ring.",

We model this using 'transducers', objects\nthat capture only the external behaviour of a system and not its internal\nstate. A companion paper summarises our results for cognitive scientists; the\ncurrent paper gives formal definitions and proofs.\n  To formalise the concept of a system that behaves as if it were pursuing a\ngoal, we consider what happens when a transducer (a 'policy') is coupled to\nanother transducer that comes equipped with a success condition (a\n'teleo-environment'). An optimal policy is identified with a transducer that\nbehaves as if it were perfectly rational in the pursuit of a goal; our\nframework also allows us to model constrained rationality.\n  Optimal policies obey a version of Bellman's principle: a policy that's\noptimal in one time step will again be optimal in the next time step, but with\nrespect to a different teleo-environment (obtained from the original one by a\nmodified version of Bayesian filtering). This property sometimes also applies\nto the bounded-rational case; we give a sufficient condition.\n  A policy is deterministic if and only if there exists a teleo-environment for\nwhich it is uniquely optimal among the set of all policies; we relate this to\nclassical representation theorems from decision theory.

Traditional techniques rely on handcrafted features\nthat often struggle to generalise to diverse scenes and require extensive\nmanual tuning. However, DL models for DE can automatically extract relevant\nfeatures from input data, adapt to various scene conditions, and generalise\nwell to unseen environments. Numerous DL-based methods have been developed,\nmaking it necessary to survey and synthesize the state-of-the-art (SOTA).\nPrevious reviews on DE have mainly focused on either monocular or stereo-based\ntechniques, rather than comprehensively reviewing DE. Furthermore, to the best\nof our knowledge, there is no systematic literature review (SLR) that\ncomprehensively focuses on DE. Therefore, this SLR study is being conducted.\nInitially, electronic databases were searched for relevant publications,\nresulting in 1284 publications. Using defined exclusion and quality criteria,\n128 publications were shortlisted and further filtered to select 59\nhigh-quality primary studies. These studies were analysed to extract data and\nanswer defined research questions. Based on the results, DL methods were\ndeveloped for mainly three different types of DE: monocular, stereo, and\nmulti-view. 20 publicly available datasets were used to train, test, and\nevaluate DL models for DE, with KITTI, NYU Depth V2, and Make 3D being the most\nused datasets. 29 evaluation metrics were used to assess the performance of DE.\n35 base models were reported in the primary studies, and the top five most-used\nbase models were ResNet-50, ResNet-18, ResNet-101, U-Net, and VGG-16.

The degree\nof a vertex $v$ in $V_1\\cup\\,V_2$ is denoted by $d_\\mathcal{B}(v)$. The minimum\ndegree of any vertex in the graph $\\mathcal{B}$ is represented by\n$\\delta(\\mathcal{B})$.

Here, we propose that G3425\noriginates from a triple through a triple common envelope (TCE) evolution. The\nG3425 progenitor originally may consist of three stars with masses of 1.49\nM$_{\\odot}$, 1.05 M$_{\\odot}$, and 21.81 M$_{\\odot}$, and inner and outer\norbital periods of 4.22 days and 1961.78 days, respectively. As evolution\nproceeds, the tertiary fills its Roche lobe, leading to a TCE. We find that the\norbital energy generated by the inspiral of the inner binary serves as an\nadditional energy imparted for ejecting the common envelope (CE), accounting\nfor $\\sim$97\\% of the binding energy in our calculations. This means that the\nouter orbit needs to expend only a small amount of the orbital energy to\nsuccessfully eject CE. The outcome of the TCE is a binary consisting of a 2.54\nM$_\\odot$ merger produced by the inner binary merger and a 7.67 M$_\\odot$\nhelium star whose CE successfully ejected, with an orbital period of 547.53\ndays. The resulting post-TCE binary (PTB) has an orbital period that is 1-2\norders of magnitude greater than the orbital period of a successfully ejected\nclassical binary CE. In subsequent simulations, we find that the successfully\nejected helium star has a 44.2\\% probability of forming a BH. In the case of a\nnon-complete fallback forming a BH, with an ejected mass of 2.6 M$_{\\odot}$ and\na relatively low natal kick ($11^{+16}_{-5}$ ${\\rm km/s}$ to $49^{+39}_{-39}$\n${\\rm km/s}$), this PTB can form G3425 in the Milky Way.",

This mechanism can be used to create an exponential\nhierarchy in the coupling between two fields by placing them at opposite ends\nof the lattice chain. Extending this mechanism, we show that when copies of\nsuch fields are appropriately attached to the lattice chain, it leads to the\nemergence of multiple massless modes. These vanishing masses are a direct\nconsequence of the locality of interactions in theory space. The latter may\nbreak down in an ordered and deterministic manner through quantum effects if\nadditional interactions exist among the chain fields. Such non-locality can\ninduce small masses for the otherwise massless modes without necessarily\ndelocalising the mass eigenstates.

This paper presents a novel\nreal-time streaming perception method named CorrDiff, designed to tackle the\nchallenge of delays in real-time detection systems. The main contribution of\nCorrDiff lies in its adaptive delay-aware detector, which is able to utilize\nruntime-estimated temporal cues to predict objects' locations for multiple\nfuture frames, and selectively produce predictions that matches real-world\ntime, effectively compensating for any communication and computational delays.\nThe proposed model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by leveraging\nmotion estimation and feature enhancement, both for 1) single-frame detection\nfor the current frame or the next frame, in terms of the metric mAP, and 2) the\nprediction for (multiple) future frame(s), in terms of the metric sAP (The sAP\nmetric is to evaluate object detection algorithms in streaming scenarios,\nfactoring in both latency and accuracy). It demonstrates robust performance\nacross a range of devices, from powerful Tesla V100 to modest RTX 2080Ti,\nachieving the highest level of perceptual accuracy on all platforms. Unlike\nmost state-of-the-art methods that struggle to complete computation within a\nsingle frame on less powerful devices, CorrDiff meets the stringent real-time\nprocessing requirements on all kinds of devices.

Currently, the\nstate-of-the-art methods in MIG are primarily adapter-based. However, these\nmethods necessitate retraining a new adapter each time a more advanced model is\nreleased, resulting in significant resource consumption. A methodology named\nDepth-Driven Decoupled Instance Synthesis (3DIS) has been introduced, which\ndecouples MIG into two distinct phases: 1) depth-based scene construction and\n2) detail rendering with widely pre-trained depth control models. The 3DIS\nmethod requires adapter training solely during the scene construction phase,\nwhile enabling various models to perform training-free detail rendering.\nInitially, 3DIS focused on rendering techniques utilizing U-Net architectures\nsuch as SD1.5, SD2, and SDXL, without exploring the potential of recent\nDiT-based models like FLUX. In this paper, we present 3DIS-FLUX, an extension\nof the 3DIS framework that integrates the FLUX model for enhanced rendering\ncapabilities. Specifically, we employ the FLUX.1-Depth-dev model for depth map\ncontrolled image generation and introduce a detail renderer that manipulates\nthe Attention Mask in FLUX's Joint Attention mechanism based on layout\ninformation. This approach allows for the precise rendering of fine-grained\nattributes of each instance. Our experimental results indicate that 3DIS-FLUX,\nleveraging the FLUX model, outperforms the original 3DIS method, which utilized\nSD2 and SDXL, and surpasses current state-of-the-art adapter-based methods in\nterms of both performance and image quality.

This detector is required to have a detection efficiency above 90 % with\nfour active gaps in the muon beam due to the limitation of the material budget.\nIn such an environment, the high current flowing through the resistive\nelectrodes causes a voltage drop, which reduces the performance of the DLC-RPC.\nThis voltage drop can be suppressed by implementing a current evacuation\npattern, though discharges are more likely to occur near the pattern. Therefore\nthe pattern must be covered by a protection cover made of an insulator. In this\nstudy, electrode samples with a current evacuation pattern and different widths\nof protection cover (0.2 mm and 0.8 mm) have been produced, and their\nperformance and stability were measured.

The astronomical observations are part of\nQUIJOTE, a Yebes 40m Q band line survey of the cold dense cloud TMC-1. We\ndetected seven individual lines corresponding to A and E components of the four\nmost favorable rotational transitions of CH3CHS covered in the Q band\n(31.0-50.3 GHz). Assuming a rotational temperature of 9 K, we derive a column\ndensity of 9.8e10 cm-2 for CH3CHS, which implies that it is 36 times less\nabundant than its oxygen counterpart CH3CHO. By comparing the column densities\nof the O- and S-bearing molecules detected in TMC-1, we find that as molecules\nincrease their degree of hydrogenation, sulfur-bearing molecules become less\nabundant compared to their oxygen analog. That is, hydrogenation seems to be\nless favored for S-bearing molecules than for O-bearing ones in cold sources\nlike TMC-1. We explored potential formation pathways to CH3CHS and implemented\nthem into a chemical model, which however underestimates by several orders of\nmagnitude the observed abundance of thioacetaldehyde.

    "abstract": "Ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study\ndynamics in solid materials on femto- and picosecond timescales. In such\nexperiments, a pump pulse induces dynamics inside a sample by impulsive\nlight-matter interaction, resulting in dynamics that can be detected using a\ntime-delayed probe pulse. In addition to the desired dynamics, the initial\ninteraction may also lead to unwanted effects that may result in irreversible\nchanges and even damage. Therefore, the achievable signal strength is often\nlimited by the pumping conditions that a sample can sustain. Here we\ninvestigate the optimization of ultrafast photoacoustics in various solid thin\nfilms. We perform systematic experiments aimed at maximizing the achievable\nsignal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in a given measurement time while limiting sample\ndamage. By varying pump and probe pulse energies, average pump fluence, and\nrepetition rate, we identify different paths towards optimal SNR depending on\nmaterial properties. Our results provide a strategy for the design of\npump-probe experiments, to optimize achievable SNR for samples in which\ndifferent damage mechanisms may dominate.",

    "abstract": "Bandit optimization is a difficult problem, especially if the reward model is\nhigh-dimensional. When rewards are modeled by neural networks, sublinear regret\nhas only been shown under strong assumptions, usually when the network is\nextremely wide. In this thesis, we investigate how pre-training can help us in\nthe regime of smaller models. We consider a stochastic contextual bandit with\nthe rewards modeled by a multi-layer neural network. The last layer is a linear\npredictor, and the layers before it are a black box neural architecture, which\nwe call a representation network. We model pre-training as an initial guess of\nthe weights of the representation network provided to the learner. To leverage\nthe pre-trained weights, we introduce a novel algorithm we call Explore Twice\nthen Commit (E2TC). During its two stages of exploration, the algorithm first\nestimates the last layer's weights using Ridge regression, and then runs\nStochastic Gradient Decent jointly on all the weights. For a locally convex\nloss function, we provide conditions on the pre-trained weights under which the\nalgorithm can learn efficiently. Under these conditions, we show sublinear\nregret of E2TC when the dimension of the last layer and number of actions $K$\nare much smaller than the horizon $T$. In the weak training regime, when only\nthe last layer is learned, the problem reduces to a misspecified linear bandit.\nWe introduce a measure of misspecification $\\epsilon_0$ for this bandit and use\nit to provide bounds $O(\\epsilon_0\\sqrt{d}KT+(KT)^{4 /5})$ or\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon_0\\sqrt{d}KT+d^{1 /3}(KT)^{2 /3})$ on the regret, depending\non regularization strength. The first of these bounds has a\ndimension-independent sublinear term, made possible by the stochasticity of\ncontexts. We also run experiments to evaluate the regret of E2TC and sample\ncomplexity of its exploration in practice.",

The seminal work in this\nfield is the 1973 Larch\\'{e}-Cahn paper (Acta Metall. 21, 1051-1063).\nSingle-phase crystals in Larch\\'{e}-Cahn theory are stable under open constant\npressure, constant temperature conditions. The Gibbs free energy does not have\nto match the product $\\mu N$ of the number of particles $N$ and their chemical\npotential $\\mu$. Similarly, the grand potential and the product $pV$ of\npressure and volume $V$ may not add up to zero. Discrepancies already arise\nunder hydrostatic stress. The elastic energy is not proportional to volume and\nthe Gibbs-Duhem relation valid for liquids is violated. Extensivity is\nrecovered by treating the number of lattice sites $M$ as an additional\nthermodynamic variable. The difference $ G-\\mu N $ can be identified with $\\nu\nM$ where $\\nu$ is the thermodynamic force conjugate to $M$.

In this work,\nwe model the coronal evolution around 231 large flares observed during solar\ncycle 24. Using Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager vector magnetic field data\naround each event, we employed nonlinear force-free field extrapolations to\napproximate the coronal energy and helicity budgets of the solar source\nregions. A superposed epoch analysis and dynamical time warping applied to the\ntime series of selected photospheric and coronal quantities were used to pin\ndown the characteristics of the pre- and postflare time evolution, as well as\nto assess flare-related changes. During the 24 hours leading up to a major\nflare, the total magnetic energy and unsigned magnetic flux were seen to evolve\nclosely with respect to each other, irrespective of the flare type. Prior to\nconfined flares, the free energy evolves in a way that exhibits more of a\nsimilarity with the unsigned flux than the helicity of the current-carrying\nfield, while the opposite trend is seen prior to eruptive flares. Furthermore,\nthe flare type can be predicted correctly in more than 90\\% of major flares\nwhen combining measures of the active regions nonpotentiality and local\nstability. The coronal energy and helicity budgets return to preflare levels\nwithin approximately six to 12 hours after eruptive major M-class flares, while\nthe impact of eruptive X-flares lasts considerably longer. Finally, the\npostflare replenishment times of more than 12 hours after eruptive X-class\nflares may serve as a partial explanation for the rare observation of eruptive\nX-class flares within a time frame of a few hours.",

Recently developed deep learning methods, particularly diffusion models\nhave reached competitive performance over traditional cheminformatical\napproaches. However, these methods are often time-consuming or require extra\nsupport from traditional methods. We propose EquiBoost, a boosting model that\nstacks several equivariant graph transformers as weak learners, to iteratively\nrefine 3D conformations of molecules. Without relying on diffusion techniques,\nEquiBoost balances accuracy and efficiency more effectively than\ndiffusion-based methods. Notably, compared to the previous state-of-the-art\ndiffusion method, EquiBoost improves generation quality and preserves\ndiversity, achieving considerably better precision of Average Minimum RMSD\n(AMR) on the GEOM datasets.

In contrast, there is a notable gap in terms of investigations of\nthe moderate-to-low density situations. These scenarios are extremely\ncommonplace across the world, including the highly populated nations like\nIndia. Additionally, the details of force-based models are expected to show\nsignificant effects at these densities, whereas the crowded, nearly packed,\nconditions may be expected to be governed largely by contact forces. In this\nstudy, we address this gap and comprehensively evaluate the performance of\ndifferent force-based models in some common scenarios. Towards this, we perform\ncontrolled experiments in four situations: avoiding a stationary obstacle,\nposition-swapping by walking toward each other, overtaking to reach a common\ngoal, and navigating through a maze of obstacles. The performance evaluation\nconsists of two stages and six evaluating parameters - successful trajectories,\noverlapping proportion, oscillation strength, path smoothness, speed deviation,\nand travel time. Firstly, models must meet an eligibility criterion of at least\n80\\% successful trajectories and secondly, the models are scored based on the\ncutoff values established from the experimental data. We evaluated five\nforce-based models where the best one scored 57.14\\%.

However, how the brain\nnetwork structure affects these dynamics after an injury (stroke) is not very\nclear. The recovery of structure and dynamics of stroke brain networks over\ntime is still not known precisely. Based on the analysis of a large number of\nstrokes' brain network data, we show that stroke changes the network properties\nin connection weights, average degree, clustering, community, etc. Yet, they\nwill recover gradually over time to some extent. We then adopt a simplified\nreaction-diffusion model to investigate stroke patients' activation propagation\nand self-sustained oscillation abilities. Our results reveal that the stroke\nslows the adoption time across different brain scales, indicating a weakened\nbrain's activation propagation ability. In addition, we show that the lifetime\nof self-sustained oscillatory patterns at three months post-stroke patients'\nbrains significantly departs from the healthy one. Finally, we examine the\nproperties of core networks of self-sustained oscillatory patterns, in which\nthe directed edges denote the main pathways of activation propagation. Our\nresults demonstrate that the lifetime and recovery of self-sustaining patterns\nare related to the properties of core networks, and the properties in the\npost-stroke greatly vary from those in the healthy group.

Despite the existing techniques aiming to accelerate sampling, they\noften compromise performance when fusing multi-source images. To ease this\nlimitation, we introduce a novel and efficient diffusion model named Diffusion\nModel for Pansharpening by Inferring Residual Inference (ResPanDiff), which\nsignificantly reduces the number of diffusion steps without sacrificing the\nperformance to tackle pansharpening task. In ResPanDiff, we innovatively\npropose a Markov chain that transits from noisy residuals to the residuals\nbetween the LRMS and HRMS images, thereby reducing the number of sampling steps\nand enhancing performance. Additionally, we design the latent space to help\nmodel extract more features at the encoding stage, Shallow\nCond-Injection~(SC-I) to help model fetch cond-injected hidden features with\nhigher dimensions, and loss functions to give a better guidance for the\nresidual generation task. enabling the model to achieve superior performance in\nresidual generation. Furthermore, experimental evaluations on pansharpening\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior outcomes\ncompared to recent state-of-the-art~(SOTA) techniques, requiring only 15\nsampling steps, which reduces over $90\\%$ step compared with the benchmark\ndiffusion models.

The solution to this dilemma is related to\nunderstanding the plasticiser migration which has a few practical implications\nfor the state of museum artefacts made of plasticised poly(vinyl chloride) -\nPVC and objects stored in their vicinity. The consequences of this process\nencompass aesthetic changes due to the presence of exudates and dust\ndeposition, an increase in air pollution and the development of mechanical\nstresses. Therefore, this paper discusses the plasticiser migration in PVC to\nprovide evidence and support the development of recommendations and guidelines\nfor conservators, collection managers and heritage scientists. Particularly,\nthe investigation is focused on the migration of the ortho-phthalates\nrepresenting the group of the most abundant plasticisers in PVC collections.\nThe predominance of inner diffusion or surface emission (evaporation)\ndetermining the rate-limiting step of the overall migration process is\nconsidered a fundament for understanding the potential environmental and\nmechanical risk. According to this concept, general correlations for various\northo-phthalates are proposed depending on their molar mass with the support of\nmolecular dynamics simulations and NMR diffusometry. The study reveals that for\nthe majority of the PVC objects in collections, the risk of accelerated\nmigration upon mild removal of surface plasticiser exudate is low. Thus,\nsurface cleaning would allow for diminishing dust deposition and air pollution\nby phthalate-emitting objects in a museum environment. Bearing in mind\nsimplicity and the need for fast decision-supporting solutions, the\nstep-by-step protocol for non-destructive identification and quantification of\nplasticisers in objects made of or containing plasticised PVC, determination of\nthe physical state of investigated artefacts and rate-limiting process of\nplasticiser migration is proposed.",

To\nquantitatively assess the impact of the selection effect, we construct mock\ngalaxy catalogs from halos in N-body simulations by selecting halos above\nredshift-dependent mass thresholds such that the resulting redshift\ndistribution of the halos, $n(z)$, matches that of SDSS-like galaxies.

To\nfurther reduce the dose, the sparse-view and/or low-dose CT settings can be\napplied together with interior tomography. Interior tomography has various\nadvantages in terms of reducing the number of detectors and decreasing the\nX-ray radiation dose. However, a large patient or small field-of-view (FOV)\ndetector can cause truncated projections, and then the reconstructed images\nsuffer from severe cupping artifacts. In addition, although the low-dose CT can\nreduce the radiation exposure dose, analytic reconstruction algorithms produce\nimage noise. Recently, many researchers have utilized image-domain deep\nlearning (DL) approaches to remove each artifact and demonstrated impressive\nperformances, and the theory of deep convolutional framelets supports the\nreason for the performance improvement. Approach: In this paper, we found that\nthe image-domain convolutional neural network (CNN) is difficult to solve\ncoupled artifacts, based on deep convolutional framelets. Significance: To\naddress the coupled problem, we decouple it into two sub-problems: (i) image\ndomain noise reduction inside truncated projection to solve low-dose CT problem\nand (ii) extrapolation of projection outside truncated projection to solve the\nROI CT problem. The decoupled sub-problems are solved directly with a novel\nproposed end-to-end learning using dual-domain CNNs. Main results: We\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional image-domain\ndeep learning methods, and a projection-domain CNN shows better performance\nthan the image-domain CNNs which are commonly used by many researchers.",

Moreover, DDSS are constrained to a single structured\ndata modality, limiting their ability to incorporate additional contextual\nknowledge. Furthermore, DDSSs' limited representation learning leads to weak\npredictive performance with scarce data. To address these challenges, we\npropose a general framework named LLM-TKESS (large language model for\ntext-based knowledge-embedded soft sensing), harnessing the powerful general\nproblem-solving capabilities, cross-modal knowledge transfer abilities, and\nfew-shot capabilities of LLM for enhanced soft sensing modeling. Specifically,\nan auxiliary variable series encoder (AVS Encoder) is proposed to unleash LLM's\npotential for capturing temporal relationships within series and spatial\nsemantic relationships among auxiliary variables. Then, we propose a two-stage\nfine-tuning alignment strategy: in the first stage, employing\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning through autoregressive training adjusts LLM to\nrapidly accommodate process variable data, resulting in a soft sensing\nfoundation model (SSFM). Subsequently, by training adapters, we adapt the SSFM\nto various downstream tasks without modifying its architecture.

It is found that, at altitudes from 50 km to 80 km, the\nmaximum relative difference in the pitch moment between the GSIS-SST and pure\nGSIS (SST) reaches 28% (20%). While the jet is supposed to reduce the surface\nheat flux, its turbulence significantly diminishes this reduction, e.g., the\nGSIS-SST predicts a heat flux about one order of magnitude higher than the GSIS\nwhen the jet pressure ratio is 1.5. Increasing the angle of attack intensifies\nlocal turbulence, resulting in expanded discrepancies in shear stress and heat\nflux between GSIS-SST and GSIS. These insights enhance our comprehension of\nlateral jet flows and highlight the importance of accounting for both turbulent\nand rarefaction effects in medium-altitude hypersonic flight.",

This\npaper introduces a flexible and scalable framework for retrieving a ranked list\nof moments from collection of videos in any length to match a text query, a\ntask termed Ranked Video Moment Retrieval (RVMR). Our framework, called\nSegment-Proposal-Ranking (SPR), simplifies the search process into three\nindependent stages: segment retrieval, proposal generation, and moment\nrefinement with re-ranking. Specifically, videos are divided into equal-length\nsegments with precomputed embeddings indexed offline, allowing efficient\nretrieval regardless of video length. For scalable online retrieval, both\nsegments and queries are projected into a shared feature space to enable\napproximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. Retrieved segments are then merged\ninto coarse-grained moment proposals. Then a refinement and re-ranking module\nis designed to reorder and adjust timestamps of the coarse-grained proposals.\nEvaluations on the TVR-Ranking dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with significant reductions in computational cost\nand processing time.

By projecting galaxies into the 2D\nlatent space defined by the first three principal components (PCs) of their\nentire visible spectra, our method remains robust even when data from\nindividual emission lines are missing. We employ Gaussian kernel density\nestimates of the classical Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) activity classes in\nthe new classification subspace, adjusted according to their relative abundance\nin our S0 sample, to generate probability maps for star-forming, Seyfert,\ncomposite, and LINER galaxies. These maps closely mirror the canonical\ndistribution of BPT classes shown by the entire galaxy population,\ndemonstrating that our PC-based taxonomy effectively predicts the dominant\nionizing mechanisms through a probabilistic approach that provides a realistic\nreflection of galaxy activity and allows for refined class membership. Our\nanalysis further reveals that flux-limited BPT-like diagrams are inherently\nbiased against composite and star-forming galaxies due to their weaker [OIII]\nemission. Besides, it suggests that although most low-activity galaxies\nexcluded from these diagnostics exhibit visual spectra with LINER-like\ncharacteristics, their remaining activity is likely driven by mechanisms\nunrelated to either star formation or supermassive black hole accretion.

Deep Learning (DL) models\npushed the boundaries of code completion by redefining what these coding\nassistants can do: We moved from predicting few code tokens to automatically\ngenerating entire functions. One important factor impacting the performance of\nDL-based code completion techniques is the context provided as input. With\n\"context\" we refer to what the model knows about the code to complete. In a\nsimple scenario, the DL model might be fed with a partially implemented\nfunction to complete. In this case, the context is represented by the\nincomplete function and, based on it, the model must generate a prediction. It\nis however possible to expand such a context to include additional information,\nlike the whole source code file containing the function to complete, which\ncould be useful to boost the prediction performance. In this work, we present\nan empirical study investigating how the performance of a DL-based code\ncompletion technique is affected by different contexts. We experiment with 8\ntypes of contexts and their combinations. These contexts include: (i) coding\ncontexts, featuring information extracted from the code base in which the code\ncompletion is invoked (e.g., code components structurally related to the one to\n\"complete\"); (ii) process context, with information aimed at depicting the\ncurrent status of the project in which a code completion task is triggered\n(e.g., a textual representation of open issues relevant for the code to\ncomplete); and (iii) developer contexts, capturing information about the\ndeveloper invoking the code completion (e.g., the APIs frequently used).

    "abstract": "Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly\nlimited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion\nexhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct\nlow-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be\nunderstood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between\ncarrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS).\nHowever, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using\nthe hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a\ncompanion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the\none-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS\napproximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger\ninteractions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns\ndiffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In\ncontrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions,\nrelevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the\nsuper-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets\nin from the superdiffusive side on timescales comparable to the phonon period.\nThe low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at\napproximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings\nin this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of\nthe most advanced quantum--classical simulations. We expect that the\nqualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more\nrealistic phonon density of states.",

Focusing on models with discrete\nundamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved\nfrom the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been\nintegrated out. Our procedure relies on the general explicit expression of HEOM\nauxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals\nthat the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced\nby genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are\nsubtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the\nprocedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring\nappropriate hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical\nmobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier\nmobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction,\nwhereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of\nthe phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current.

We apply a\nsimilar idea to the Undercover heuristic that fixes a variable cover to the\nrounded relaxation values.

    "abstract": "The programming landscape is nowadays being reshaped by the advent of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) able to automate code-related tasks related to code\nimplementation (e.g., code completion) and comprehension (e.g., code\nsummarization). Such a paradigm shift comes with a number of implications\nrelated to how software will be written, maintained, and evolved. Also, these\nLLMs are extremely expensive to train, posing questions on their sustainability\nover time. Given their training cost, their ability to generalize, namely their\nability to work on task instances different from those on which they have been\ntrained, is an aspect worth being investigated. Previous work already showed\nthat transformer models can successfully support code completion in a\ncross-project setting. However, it is unclear whether LLM are able to\ngeneralize to inputs having lengths not seen during training. For example, it\nis known that training a model on short instances allows to substantially\nreduce the training cost. However, the extent to which such a model would\nprovide good performance on sequences having lengths not seen during training\nis not known. Many recent works in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tackled\nthis problem in the context of decoder-only LLMs, i.e., xPOS and ALiBi. To\nassess if these solutions extend to encoder-decoder LLMs usually adopted in the\ncode-related tasks, we present a large empirical study evaluating this\ngeneralization property of these and other encoding schemes proposed in the\nliterature, namely Sinusoidal, xPOS, ALiBi, and T5. We found that none of these\nsolutions successfully generalize to unseen lengths and that the only safe\nsolution is to ensure the representativeness in the training set of all lengths\nlikely to be encountered at inference time.",

Most conventional methods estimate multiple tags independently by\ntreating them as multiple independent binary classification problems. This\ntreatment overlooks the conditional dependencies among music tags, leading to\nsuboptimal tagging performance. Unlike most music taggers, the proposed method\nsequentially estimates each tag based on the idea of the classifier chains.\nBeyond the naive classifier chains, the proposed method groups the multiple\ntags by category, such as genre, and performs chains by unit of groups, which\nwe call \\textit{classifier group chains}.

For the costs of the clusters we take the weight of a\nminimum-weight spanning tree on the objects in~$V_i$, which may serve as a\nproxy for the cost of traversing all objects in the cluster, but also as a\nshape-invariant measure of cluster density similar to Single-Linkage\nClustering.\n  This setting has been studied by Even, Garg, K\\\"onemann, Ravi, Sinha (Oper.\nRes.

In fact, our algorithm is purely combinatorial and can process\nmetric spaces with 10,000 points in less than a second.\n  As an extension, we also consider the case where instead of a target number\nof clusters we are provided with a set of depots in the space such that every\ncluster should contain at least one such depot.

Using the geodesic nudged elastic band\nmethod, we have determined the energy barriers for magnetization reversal in\nchains consisting of 5 to 100 atoms. Additionally, the frequency prefactors\nhave been calculated within the framework of the harmonic approximation of\ntransition state theory.

The\nunit cell of one class is characterized by elements where deformations are\nlumped within a finite-degrees-of-freedom framework. In contrast, the other\nclass involves smeared deformation, modelled as flexurally deformable rods with\nsufficiently high axial compliance. Under increasing compressive load, the\nelasticity tensor of the equivalent material loses positive definiteness and\nsubsequently undergoes an ellipticity loss. Remarkably, in certain conditions,\nthis loss of stability is followed by a subsequent restabilization; that is,\nthe material re-enters the elliptic regime and even the positive definiteness\ndomain and simultaneously, the underlying elastic lattice returns to a stable\nstate.

How to effectively correct scatter\nsignals in CT has always been a focal point of research for researchers. This\nwork presents a new framework for eliminating scatter artifacts in CT. In the\nframework, the interaction between photons and matter is characterized as a\nMarkov process, and the calculation of the scatter signal intensity in CT is\ntransformed into the computation of a $4n$-dimensional integral, where $n$ is\nthe highest scatter order. Given the low-frequency characteristics of scatter\nsignals in CT, this paper uses the quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method combined with\nforced fixed detection and down sampling to compute the integral. In the\nreconstruction process, the impact of scatter signals on the X-ray energy\nspectrum is considered. A scatter-corrected spectrum estimation method is\nproposed and applied to estimate the X-ray energy spectrum. Based on the\nFeldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm, a multi-module coupled reconstruction\nmethod, referred to as FDK-QMC-BM4D, has been developed to simultaneously\neliminate scatter artifacts, beam hardening artifacts, and noise in CT imaging.\nFinally, the effectiveness of the FDK-QMC-BM4D method is validated in the\nShepp-Logan phantom and head. Compared to the widely recognized Monte Carlo\nmethod, which is the most accurate method by now for estimating and correcting\nscatter signals in CT, the FDK-QMC-BM4D method improves the running speed by\napproximately $102$ times while ensuring accuracy.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the time-dependent dynamics of an end-of-the-world\n(EOW) brane in AdS with a scalar field localized on the brane. We mainly\nstudied several aspects of holography and cosmology. Standard requirements in\nthe AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$ lead to a constraint on the conformal dimension in the\ndS$_d$/CFT$_{d-1}$. We also prove a time-like analog of g-theorem using the\nnull energy condition in the context of AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$. In the cosmological\ninterpretation, we rewrite the equation of motion of the brane as a\nFriedman-like equation, which enables us to consider its dynamics in analogy\nwith the ordinal cosmology. And then we classify all possible solutions of the\nbrane when the potential takes a constant value. We find that our brane\ncosmology model can describe a process of creating a universe via a big-bang.\nAdditionally, we show that when the brane is close to a hyperplane, its\neffective action is given by a Liouville gravity with a scalar field matter.\nFinally, we also obtain brane solutions with boost symmetry, which are obtained\nby analytical continuation of Euclidean branes with a torus topology.",

In particular, the proposed detection scheme is based on\nSourcextractor software and on applying a new algorithm capable of associating\nmoving objects amongst different catalogues. After applying a suite of filters\nto improve the detection quality, we study the expected purity and completeness\nof the SSO detections. We also show how a Kohonen self-organising neural\nnetwork can be successfully trained (in an unsupervised fashion) to classify\nstars, galaxies, and SSOs.

Specifically, our\nanalysis shows that, under the isolation assumption, the min-sum decoder fails\nto converge when constant-weight errors are applied to symmetric stabilizers,\nas variable-to-check messages oscillate in every iteration. To address this, we\nintroduce a decoding technique that exploits this oscillatory property by\napplying distinct update rules: variable nodes in one block utilize messages\nfrom previous iterations, while those in the other block are updated\nconventionally. Logical error-rate results demonstrate that the proposed\ndecoder significantly outperforms the normalized min-sum decoder and achieves\ncompetitive performance with belief propagation enhanced by order-zero ordered\nstatistics decoding, all while maintaining linear complexity in the code's\nblock length.",

We propose CKPD-FSCIL, a unified framework\nthat unlocks the underutilized capacity of pretrained weights, achieving a\nsuperior stability-plasticity balance with zero inference overhead. Our design\nintegrates two continuously adapting mechanisms: At the weight level, a\nContinuous Knowledge-Preserving Decomposition mechanism uses feature covariance\nto split each weight matrix into a frozen subspace that safeguards prior\nknowledge and a learnable, redundant subspace for new tasks. At the layer\nlevel, a Continuous Adaptive Layer Selection mechanism leverages an Adapter\nSensitivity Ratio to automatically select layers with the highest redundant\ncapacity and lowest forgetting risk for adaptation. By targeting only safe,\nhigh-potential subspaces and layers, CKPD-FSCIL enables efficient adaptation.\nAfter each session, the learned adapters are merged back into the original\nweights, ensuring zero additional parameters or FLOPs during inference.\nExtensive experiments on multiple FSCIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both adaptability and\nknowledge retention.

Here we make a major update of\nGNC~ by integrating stellar potential and adiabatic invariant theory, so that\nwe can study the self-consistent dynamics of NSCs with increasing mass of the\nMBH. We perform tests of the self-adaptation of cluster density due to MBH mass\ngrowth and Plummer core collapse, both finding consistent results with previous\nstudies, the latter having a core collapse time of $\\sim 17t_{\\rm rh}$ by GNC,\nwhere $t_{\\rm rh}$ is the time of half-mass relaxation. We use GNC~ to study\nthe cosmological evolution of the properties of NSC and the mass of MBH\nassuming that the mass growth of the MBH is due to loss-cone accretion of stars\n(e.g., tidal disruption of stars) and stellar black holes, and compare the\nsimulation results with the observations of NSCs in Milky-Way or near-by\ngalaxies.

Prior studies have designed\nattack noticeability measures on graphs, primarily using statistical tests to\ncompare the topology of original and (possibly) attacked graphs. However, we\nobserve two critical limitations in the existing measures. First, because the\nmeasures rely on simple rules, attackers can readily enhance their attacks to\nbypass them, reducing their attack \"noticeability\" and, yet, maintaining their\nattack performance. Second, because the measures naively leverage global\nstatistics, such as degree distributions, they may entirely overlook attacks\nuntil severe perturbations occur, letting the attacks be almost \"totally\nunnoticeable.\" To address the limitations, we introduce HideNSeek, a learnable\nmeasure for graph attack noticeability. First, to mitigate the bypass problem,\nHideNSeek learns to distinguish the original and (potential) attack edges using\na learnable edge scorer (LEO), which scores each edge on its likelihood of\nbeing an attack. Second, to mitigate the overlooking problem, HideNSeek\nconducts imbalance-aware aggregation of all the edge scores to obtain the final\nnoticeability score. Using six real-world graphs, we empirically demonstrate\nthat HideNSeek effectively alleviates the observed limitations, and LEO (i.e.,\nour learnable edge scorer) outperforms eleven competitors in distinguishing\nattack edges under five different attack methods. For an additional\napplication, we show that LEO boost the performance of robust GNNs by removing\nattack-like edges.",

By setting different forms\nof perturbation coefficients, we aim to recover the dark and anti-dark one- and\ntwo-soliton structures by employing an enhanced physics-based deep neural\nnetwork algorithm, namely a physics-informed neural network (PINN). The\nenhanced PINN algorithm leverages the locally adaptive activation function\nmechanism to improve convergence speed and accuracy. In the lack of data\nacquisition, the PINN algorithms will enhance the capability of the neural\nnetworks by incorporating physical information into the training phase. We\ndemonstrate that applying PINN algorithms to (2+1)-dimensional VC-CNLSEs\nrequires distinct distributions of physical information. To address this, we\npropose a region-specific weighted loss function with the help of\nresidual-based adaptive refinement strategy. In the meantime, we perform\ndata-driven parameter discovery for the model equation, classified into two\ncategories: constant coefficient discovery and variable coefficient discovery.\nFor the former, we aim to predict the cross-phase modulation constant\ncoefficient under varying noise intensities using enhanced PINN with a single\nneural network. For the latter, we employ a dual-network strategy to predict\nthe dynamic behavior of the dispersion and nonlinearity perturbation functions.\nOur study demonstrates that the proposed framework holds significant potential\nfor studying high-dimensional and complex solitonic dynamics in optical fiber\nsystems.",

Previous infrared observations have\nreported that both objects show deep ice and dust absorption features that are\noften seen in embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) or background stars sitting\nbehind dense clouds, however, they are located neither in known star-forming\nregions nor in known dense clouds. Their infrared spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) show a peak around 5 micron, which are incompatible with existing SED\nmodels of typical embedded YSOs. The present ALMA observations have detected\ncompact emission of CO(3-2) and SiO(8-7) at the positions of the icy objects.\nThe observed large column ratios of gas-phase SiO/CO (~10^-3) in both objects,\nas well as their broad line widths (8-14 km/s), imply that they are associated\nwith shocked gas. Although a large dust extinction (Av ~100 mag) is expected\nfrom their deep dust/ice absorption, no dust continuum emission is detected,\nwhich would suggest a large beam dilution effect due to their compact source\nsizes. Their systemic velocities are clearly separated from the surrounding CO\nclouds, suggesting that they are isolated.

    "abstract": "The discovery of causal relations from observed data has attracted\nsignificant interest from disciplines such as economics, social sciences, and\nbiology. In practical applications, considerable knowledge of the underlying\nsystems is often unavailable, and real data are usually associated with\nnonlinear causal structures, which makes the direct use of most conventional\ncausality analysis methods difficult. This study proposes a novel quantum\nPeter-Clark (qPC) algorithm for causal discovery that does not require any\nassumptions about the underlying model structures. Based on conditional\nindependence tests in a class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces\ncharacterized by quantum circuits, the proposed algorithm can explore causal\nrelations from the observed data drawn from arbitrary distributions. We\nconducted systematic experiments on fundamental graphs of causal structures,\ndemonstrating that the qPC algorithm exhibits better performance, particularly\nwith smaller sample sizes compared to its classical counterpart. Furthermore,\nwe proposed a novel optimization approach based on Kernel Target Alignment\n(KTA) for determining hyperparameters of quantum kernels. This method\neffectively reduced the risk of false positives in causal discovery, enabling\nmore reliable inference. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate\nthat the quantum algorithm can empower classical algorithms for accurate\ninference in causal discovery, supporting them in regimes where classical\nalgorithms typically fail. In addition, the effectiveness of this method was\nvalidated using the datasets on Boston housing prices, heart disease, and\nbiological signaling systems as real-world applications. These findings\nhighlight the potential of quantum-based causal discovery methods in addressing\npractical challenges, particularly in small-sample scenarios, where traditional\napproaches have shown significant limitations.",

Traditional manual analysis methods have significant limitations in\nterms of accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, this paper proposes a\ndeep learning network framework based on the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model,\ninitialized with weights from the ImageNet-1K dataset (version 2). The last\nlayer of the model (the fully connected layer) is replaced with a new fully\nconnected layer, and a softmax activation function is added to efficiently\nclassify three types of lung cancer CT scan images.

    "abstract": "3D Referring Expression Segmentation (3D-RES) aims to segment point cloud\nscenes based on a given expression. However, existing 3D-RES approaches face\ntwo major challenges: feature ambiguity and intent ambiguity. Feature ambiguity\narises from information loss or distortion during point cloud acquisition due\nto limitations such as lighting and viewpoint. Intent ambiguity refers to the\nmodel's equal treatment of all queries during the decoding process, lacking\ntop-down task-specific guidance. In this paper, we introduce an Image enhanced\nPrompt Decoding Network (IPDN), which leverages multi-view images and\ntask-driven information to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. To\naddress feature ambiguity, we propose the Multi-view Semantic Embedding (MSE)\nmodule, which injects multi-view 2D image information into the 3D scene and\ncompensates for potential spatial information loss. To tackle intent ambiguity,\nwe designed a Prompt-Aware Decoder (PAD) that guides the decoding process by\nderiving task-driven signals from the interaction between the expression and\nvisual features. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that IPDN outperforms\nthe state-ofthe-art by 1.9 and 4.2 points in mIoU metrics on the 3D-RES and\n3D-GRES tasks, respectively.",

To facilitate the development of autonomous vessels, high-fidelity\nsimulations are required to model realistic interactions with other vessels.\nHowever, modeling realistic interactive maritime traffic is challenging due to\nthe unstructured environment, coarsely specified traffic rules, and largely\nvarying vessel types. Currently, there is no standard for simulating\ninteractive maritime environments in order to rigorously benchmark autonomous\nvessel algorithms. In this paper, we introduce the first intelligent sailing\nmodel (ISM), which simulates rule-compliant vessels for navigation on the open\nsea. An ISM vessel reacts to other traffic participants according to maritime\ntraffic rules while at the same time solving a motion planning task\ncharacterized by waypoints. In particular, the ISM monitors the applicable\nrules, generates rule-compliant waypoints accordingly, and utilizes a model\npredictive control for tracking the waypoints. We evaluate the ISM in two\nenvironments: interactive traffic with only ISM vessels and mixed traffic where\nsome vessel trajectories are from recorded real-world maritime traffic data or\nhandcrafted for criticality. Our results show that simulations with many ISM\nvessels of different vessel types are rule-compliant and scalable. We tested\n4,049 critical traffic scenarios. For interactive traffic with ISM vessels, no\ncollisions occurred while goal-reaching rates of about 97 percent were\nachieved.

Motivated\nby this observation, we propose TreeKV, an intuitive, training-free method that\nemploys a tree structure for smooth cache compression. TreeKV maintains a fixed\ncache size, allowing LLMs to deliver high-quality output even in long text\nscenarios.

    "abstract": "Every day, we judge the probability of propositions. When we communicate\ngraded confidence (e.g. \"I am 90% sure\"), we enable others to gauge how much\nweight to attach to our judgment. Ideally, people should share their judgments\nto reach more accurate conclusions collectively. Peer-to-peer tools for\ncollective inference could help debunk disinformation and amplify reliable\ninformation on social networks, improving democratic discourse. However,\nindividuals fall short of the ideal of well-calibrated probability judgments,\nand group dynamics can amplify errors and polarize opinions. Here, we connect\ninsights from cognitive science, structured expert judgment, and crowdsourcing\nto infer the truth of propositions from human probability judgments. In an\nonline experiment, 376 participants judged the probability of each of 1,200\ngeneral-knowledge claims for which we have ground truth (451,200 ratings).\nAggregating binary judgments by majority vote already exhibits the \"wisdom of\nthe crowd\"--the superior accuracy of collective inferences relative to\nindividual inferences. However, using continuous probability ratings and\naccounting for individual accuracy and calibration significantly improves\ncollective inferences. Peer judgment behavior can be modeled probabilistically,\nand individual parameters capturing each peer's accuracy and miscalibration can\nbe inferred jointly with the claim probabilities. This unsupervised approach\ncan be complemented by supervised methods relying on truth labels to learn\nmodels that achieve well-calibrated collective inference. The algorithms we\nintroduce can empower groups of collaborators and online communities to pool\ntheir distributed intelligence and jointly judge the probability of\npropositions with a well-calibrated sense of uncertainty.",

Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) agents address this by learning from experience and maximizing\nrewards, which helps them adapt to dynamic environments. However, ensuring\ntheir generalization remains challenging, especially with static training\nenvironments. Additionally, DRL models lack transparency, making it difficult\nto guarantee safety in all scenarios, particularly those not seen during\ntraining. To tackle these issues, we propose a method that combines DRL with\nCurriculum Learning for autonomous driving. Our approach uses a Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) agent and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn safe\ndriving in the CARLA simulator. The agent is trained using two-fold curriculum\nlearning, progressively increasing environment difficulty and incorporating a\ncollision penalty in the reward function to promote safety.

To understand the true nature of the old\nGC MPs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we study the Ca--CN--CH photometry\nof the old metal-poor LMC GC NGC 2257. We find the predominantly FG-dominated\npopulational number ratio of $n$(FG):$n$(SG) = 61:39($\\pm$4), where the FG and\nSG denote the first and second generations. Both the FG and SG have similar\ncumulative radial distributions, consistent with the idea that NGC 2257 is\ndynamically old.

The NGC 2257 FG shows a somewhat larger metallicity variation than\nthe SG, the first detection of such phenomenon in an old LMC GC, similar to\nGalactic GCs with MPs, strongly suggesting that it is a general characteristic\nof GCs with MPs. Interestingly, the NGC 2257 SG does not show a helium\nenhancement compared to the FG. Our results for the Galactic normal GCs exhibit\nthat the degree of carbon and nitrogen variations are tightly correlated with\nthe GC mass, while NGC 2257 exhibits slightly smaller variations for its mass.\nWe show that old LMC GCs follow the same trends as the Galactic normal GCs in\nthe $\\Delta$W$_{\\rm CF336W,F438W,F814W}$, $N_{\\rm FG}/N_{\\rm tot}$, and $\\log\nM/M_{\\rm \\odot}$ domains.

Recently, Polymer Matrix Sand\nComposites (PMSCs) have emerged as a viable cost-effective option. This ongoing\nresearch focuses on providing stronger protection against diverse ballistic\nimpacts. The study examines the enhancement of ballistic resistance in PMSCs\nthrough the graded incorporation of sand. Variable properties are achieved\nalong the thickness by altering the sand particle size and weight fraction in\nthe polymer matrix. The gradation creates a stepwise structure, starting with a\ndense base impact zone containing abrasive sand particles with a typical size\nrange. This layer is brittle and hard, effectively eroding incoming\nprojectiles. Subsequent layers are less dense, offering tensile strength that\nreflects stress waves and reduces impact energy while supporting the frontal\nbrittle zone. The minimally dense or neat matrix regions prevent backlash and\nprovide a cushioning effect. The addition of sand particles increases the\ncomposite's surface area, enhancing adhesion between inclusions and the matrix.\nThis improved adhesion ensures efficient load transfer, increasing overall\nhardness. PMSCs were fabricated to analyze the effects of two matrix\ncompositions, and refining manufacturing methods. These composites were\nsubjected to tensile testing, Izod impact testing, Shore-D hardness testing,\nand other evaluations to assess their mechanical properties. The findings show\nthat varying the sand content significantly impacts mechanical properties up to\nan optimal weight fraction for a given size range of inclusions. Experimental\nand simulation studies were employed to extract properties and evaluate\nmaterial behavior under ballistic threats. The research underscores the\npotential of PMSCs as affordable and sustainable composites for advanced\nballistic protection.",

The most recent\napproaches assume the existence of a single background source and represent the\nbackground signal using a linear dynamical system (LDS). This assumption might\nfail to capture the complexities of modern electromagnetic environments with\nmultiple sources. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a method for\ndetecting the transient signal in a background composed of an unknown number of\nemitters. The proposed method consists of two main tasks. First, a Bayesian\nnonparametric model called the infinite factorial linear dynamical system\n(IFLDS) is developed. The developed model is based on the sticky Indian buffet\nprocess and enables the representation and parameter learning of the unbounded\nnumber of background sources. This study also designs a parameter learning\nmethod for the IFLDS using slice sampling and particle Gibbs with ancestor\nsampling. Second, the finite moving average (FMA) stopping time is introduced\nto minimize the worst-case probability of missed detection, and the statistical\nperformance of the stopping time is investigated. To facilitate the computation\nof the FMA stopping time, this study derives the factorial Kalman forward\nfiltering (FKFF) method and designs a dependence structure for the underlying\nmodel, allowing the stopping time to be defined by a recursive function.\nNumerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and\nthe validity of the theoretical results.

TAFAS, the proposed approach to TSF-TTA, flexibly adapts source\nforecasters to continuously shifting test distributions while preserving the\ncore semantic information learned during pre-training. The novel utilization of\npartially-observed ground truth and gated calibration module enables proactive,\nrobust, and model-agnostic adaptation of source forecasters. Experiments on\ndiverse benchmark datasets and cutting-edge architectures demonstrate the\nefficacy and generality of TAFAS, especially in long-term forecasting scenarios\nthat suffer from significant distribution shifts.

    "abstract": "As opposed to human drivers, current autonomous driving systems still require\nvast amounts of labeled data to train. Recently, world models have been\nproposed to simultaneously enhance autonomous driving capabilities by improving\nthe way these systems understand complex real-world environments and reduce\ntheir data demands via self-supervised pre-training. In this paper, we present\nAD-L-JEPA (aka Autonomous Driving with LiDAR data via a Joint Embedding\nPredictive Architecture), a novel self-supervised pre-training framework for\nautonomous driving with LiDAR data that, as opposed to existing methods, is\nneither generative nor contrastive. Our method learns spatial world models with\na joint embedding predictive architecture. Instead of explicitly generating\nmasked unknown regions, our self-supervised world models predict Bird's Eye\nView (BEV) embeddings to represent the diverse nature of autonomous driving\nscenes. Our approach furthermore eliminates the need to manually create\npositive and negative pairs, as is the case in contrastive learning. AD-L-JEPA\nleads to simpler implementation and enhanced learned representations. We\nqualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate high-quality of embeddings learned\nwith AD-L-JEPA. We furthermore evaluate the accuracy and label efficiency of\nAD-L-JEPA on popular downstream tasks such as LiDAR 3D object detection and\nassociated transfer learning. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that\nAD-L-JEPA is a plausible approach for self-supervised pre-training in\nautonomous driving applications and is the best available approach\noutperforming SOTA, including most recently proposed Occupancy-MAE [1] and ALSO\n[2].

We designed an experiment to consolidate various phonemes to\ntrain visemes of each phoneme, aiming to learn the representation of\ncorresponding lip formations from neural signals.

We investigate the excitation of $r$-modes by the\nmechanical impact on the neutron star surface of stochastically accreted clumps\nof matter, assuming that the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability is not\ntriggered. The star is idealised as a slowly-rotating, unmagnetised,\none-component fluid with a barotropic equation of state in Newtonian gravity.\nIt is found that the $r$-mode amplitude depends weakly on the equation of state\nbut sensitively on the rotation frequency $\\nu_{\\rm s}$. The gravitational wave\nstrain implicitly depends on the equation of state through the damping\ntimescale. The root-mean-square strain is $h_{\\rm rms} \\approx 10^{-35}\n(\\nu_{\\rm s}/ 10 {\\rm Hz})^{2} (R_*/10 {\\rm km})^2 (\\Delta t_{\\rm acc}/1 {\\rm\nyr})^{1/2} (f_{\\rm acc}/1 {\\rm kHz})^{-1/2} (\\dot{M}/10^{-8} \\text{M}_{\\odot}\n\\text{yr}^{-1}) (v/0.4c) (d/1 {\\rm kpc})^{-1}$, which is comparable to the\nstrain from $g$-, $p$- and $f$-modes excited by stochastic accretion, where\n$R_*$ is the radius of the star, $\\Delta t_{\\rm acc}$ is the uninterrupted\nduration of an accretion episode, $f_{\\rm acc}$ is the mean clump impact\nfrequency, $\\dot{M}$ is the accretion rate, $v$ is the impact speed, and $d$ is\nthe distance of the star from the Earth. An observational test is proposed,\nbased on the temporal autocorrelation function of the gravitational wave\nsignal, to discern whether the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability\nswitches on and coexists with impact-excited $r$-modes before or during a\ngravitational wave observation.",

    "abstract": "Many residential prosumers exhibit a high price-tolerance for household\nelectricity bills and a low response to price incentives. This is because the\nhousehold electricity bills are not inherently high, and the potential for\nsaving on electricity bills through participation in conventional Shared Energy\nStorage (SES) is limited, which diminishes their motivation to actively engage\nin SES. Additionally, existing SES models often require prosumers to take\nadditional actions, such as optimizing rental capacity and bidding prices,\nwhich happen to be capabilities that typical household prosumers do not\npossess. To incentivize these high price-tolerance residential prosumers to\nparticipate in SES, a novel SES aggregation framework is proposed, which does\nnot require prosumers to take additional actions and allows them to maintain\nexisting energy storage patterns. Compared to conventional long-term operation\nof SES, the proposed framework introduces an additional short-term construction\nstep during which the energy service provider (ESP) acquires control of the\nenergy storage systems (ESS) and offers electricity deposit and withdrawal\nservices (DWS) with dynamic coefficients, enabling prosumers to withdraw more\nelectricity than they deposit without additional actions. Additionally, a\nmatching mechanism is proposed to align prosumers' electricity consumption\nbehaviors with ESP's optimization strategies. Finally, the dynamic coefficients\nin DWS and trading strategies are optimized by an improved deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) algorithm. Case studies are conducted to verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed SES aggregation framework with DWS and the\nmatching mechanism.",

Yet more\noften than not, only a fraction of these features are frequently utilized by\nusers, thus a bloated app costs dearly in potential vulnerabilities, expanded\nattack surfaces, and additional resource consumption. Especially in the event\nof severe security incidents, users have the need to block vulnerable\nfunctionalities immediately. Existing works have proposed various code\ndebloating approaches for identifying and removing features of executable\ncomponents.

It intercepts invocations of debloated bytecode methods to\nprevent their interpretation, compilation, and execution, while zero-filling\nmemory spaces of debloated native methods during code loading. Evaluation\ndemonstrates 3DNDroid's ability to debloat 187 DEX methods and 30 native\nmethods across 55 real-world apps, removing over 10K Return-Oriented\nProgramming (ROP) gadgets.

    "abstract": "As a ubiquitous deployment paradigm, integrating microservice architecture\n(MSA) into edge networks promises to enhance the flexibility and scalability of\nservices. However, it also presents significant challenges stemming from\ndispersed node locations and intricate network topologies. In this paper, we\nhave proposed a topology-aware MSA characterized by a three-tier network\ntraffic model encompassing the service, microservices, and edge node layers.\nThis model meticulously characterizes the complex dependencies between edge\nnetwork topologies and microservices, mapping microservice deployment onto link\ntraffic to accurately estimate communication delay. Building upon this model,\nwe have formulated a weighted sum communication delay optimization problem\nconsidering different types of services. Then, a novel topology-aware and\nindividual-adaptive microservices deployment (TAIA-MD) scheme is proposed to\nsolve the problem efficiently, which accurately senses the network topology and\nincorporates an individual-adaptive mechanism in a genetic algorithm to\naccelerate the convergence and avoid local optima. Extensive simulations show\nthat, compared to the existing deployment schemes, TAIA-MD improves the\ncommunication delay performance by approximately 30% to 60% and effectively\nenhances the overall network performance. Furthermore, we implement the TAIA-MD\nscheme on a practical microservice physical platform. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that TAIA-MD achieves superior robustness in withstanding link\nfailures and network fluctuations.",

More recently, its\npotential application to AI safety has gained attention. In this paper, we\nidentify key limitations that prevent unlearning from serving as a\ncomprehensive solution for AI safety, particularly in managing dual-use\nknowledge in sensitive domains like cybersecurity and chemical, biological,\nradiological, and nuclear (CBRN) safety.

We provide an overview of inherent constraints and open\nproblems, including the broader side effects of unlearning dangerous knowledge,\nas well as previously unexplored tensions between unlearning and existing\nsafety mechanisms. Finally, we investigate challenges related to evaluation,\nrobustness, and the preservation of safety features during unlearning.

However, transformer poses challenges in terms of speed and\nmemory usage because of its quadratic computational complexity. Recently, the\nMamba model has emerged as a promising approach, which has strong long-distance\nmodeling capabilities while maintaining a linear computational complexity.\nHowever, representing the HSI is challenging for the Mamba due to the\nrequirement for an integrated spatial and spectral understanding. To remedy\nthese drawbacks, we propose a novel HSI classification model based on a Mamba\nmodel, named MambaHSI, which can simultaneously model long-range interaction of\nthe whole image and integrate spatial and spectral information in an adaptive\nmanner. Specifically, we design a spatial Mamba block (SpaMB) to model the\nlong-range interaction of the whole image at the pixel-level. Then, we propose\na spectral Mamba block (SpeMB) to split the spectral vector into multiple\ngroups, mine the relations across different spectral groups, and extract\nspectral features. Finally, we propose a spatial-spectral fusion module (SSFM)\nto adaptively integrate spatial and spectral features of a HSI. To our best\nknowledge, this is the first image-level HSI classification model based on the\nMamba. We conduct extensive experiments on four diverse HSI datasets.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in audio deepfake detection have leveraged graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) to model frequency and temporal interdependencies in audio\ndata, effectively identifying deepfake artifacts. However, the reliance of\nGNN-based methods on substantial labeled data for graph construction and robust\nperformance limits their applicability in scenarios with limited labeled data.\nAlthough vast amounts of audio data exist, the process of labeling samples as\ngenuine or fake remains labor-intensive and costly. To address this challenge,\nwe propose SIGNL (Spatio-temporal vIsion Graph Non-contrastive Learning), a\nnovel framework that maintains high GNN performance in low-label settings.\nSIGNL constructs spatio-temporal graphs by representing patches from the\naudio's visual spectrogram as nodes. These graph structures are modeled using\nvision graph convolutional (GC) encoders pre-trained through graph\nnon-contrastive learning, a label-free that maximizes the similarity between\npositive pairs. The pre-trained encoders are then fine-tuned for audio deepfake\ndetection, reducing reliance on labeled data. Experiments demonstrate that\nSIGNL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple audio deepfake\ndetection datasets, achieving the lowest Equal Error Rate (EER) with as little\nas 5% labeled data. Additionally, SIGNL exhibits strong cross-domain\ngeneralization, achieving the lowest EER in evaluations involving diverse\nattack types and languages in the In-The-Wild dataset.",

In these scenarios, unchanged pixels between changed instances are\nalso mistakenly identified as changed, causing multiple changes to be\nmistakenly viewed as one. In practical applications, this issue prevents the\naccurate quantification of the number of changes. To address this issue, we\npropose a Dense Instance Separation (DISep) method as a plug-and-play solution,\nrefining pixel features from a unified instance perspective under scene-level\nsupervision. Specifically, our DISep comprises a three-step iterative training\nprocess: 1) Instance Localization: We locate instance candidate regions for\nchanged pixels using high-pass class activation maps. 2) Instance Retrieval: We\nidentify and group these changed pixels into different instance IDs through\nconnectivity searching. Then, based on the assigned instance IDs, we extract\ncorresponding pixel-level features on a per-instance basis. 3) Instance\nSeparation: We introduce a separation loss to enforce intra-instance pixel\nconsistency in the embedding space, thereby ensuring separable instance feature\nrepresentations. The proposed DISep adds only minimal training cost and no\ninference cost. It can be seamlessly integrated to enhance existing WSCD\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Computer-aided design (CAD) tools empower designers to design and modify 3D\nmodels through a series of CAD operations, commonly referred to as a CAD\nsequence. In scenarios where digital CAD files are not accessible, reverse\nengineering (RE) has been used to reconstruct 3D CAD models. Recent advances\nhave seen the rise of data-driven approaches for RE, with a primary focus on\nconverting 3D data, such as point clouds, into 3D models in boundary\nrepresentation (B-rep) format. However, obtaining 3D data poses significant\nchallenges, and B-rep models do not reveal knowledge about the 3D modeling\nprocess of designs. To this end, our research introduces a novel data-driven\napproach with an Image2CADSeq neural network model. This model aims to reverse\nengineer CAD models by processing images as input and generating CAD sequences.\nThese sequences can then be translated into B-rep models using a solid modeling\nkernel. Unlike B-rep models, CAD sequences offer enhanced flexibility to modify\nindividual steps of model creation, providing a deeper understanding of the\nconstruction process of CAD models. To quantitatively and rigorously evaluate\nthe predictive performance of the Image2CADSeq model, we have developed a\nmulti-level evaluation framework for model assessment. The model was trained on\na specially synthesized dataset, and various network architectures were\nexplored to optimize the performance. The experimental and validation results\nshow great potential for the model in generating CAD sequences from 2D image\ndata.",

This paper investigates the performance\ngain of a CAPA-based downlink secure transmission system, where multiple\nlegitimate user terminals (LUTs) coexist with multiple eavesdroppers (Eves).\nThe system's secrecy performance is evaluated using a weighted secrecy sum-rate\n(WSSR) under a power constraint. We then propose two solutions for the secure\ncurrent pattern design. The first solution is a block coordinate descent (BCD)\noptimization method based on fractional programming, which introduces a\ncontinuous-function inversion theory corresponding to matrix inversion in the\ndiscrete domain. This approach derives a closed-form expression for the optimal\nsource current pattern. Based on this, it can be found that the optimal current\npattern is essentially a linear combination of the channel spatial responses,\nthus eliminating the need for complex integration operations during the\nalgorithm's optimization process. The second solution is a heuristic algorithm\nbased on Zero-Forcing (ZF), which constructs a zero-leakage current pattern\nusing the channel correlation matrix. It further employs a water-filling\napproach to design an optimal power allocation scheme that maximizes the WSSR.\nIn high SNR regions, this solution gradually approaches the first solution,\nensuring zero leakage while offering lower computational complexity. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that: 1) CAPA-based systems achieve better WSSR compared to\ndiscrete multiple-input multiple-output systems. 2) The proposed methods,\nwhether optimization-based or heuristic, provide significant performance\nimprovements over existing state-of-the-art Fourier-based discretization\nmethods, while considerably reducing computational complexity.",

    "abstract": "Designing a dental crown is a time-consuming and labor intensive process. Our\ngoal is to simplify crown design and minimize the tediousness of making manual\nadjustments while still ensuring the highest level of accuracy and consistency.\nTo this end, we present a new end- to-end deep learning approach, coined Dental\nMesh Completion (DMC), to generate a crown mesh conditioned on a point cloud\ncontext. The dental context includes the tooth prepared to receive a crown and\nits surroundings, namely the two adjacent teeth and the three closest teeth in\nthe opposing jaw. We formulate crown generation in terms of completing this\npoint cloud context. A feature extractor first converts the input point cloud\ninto a set of feature vectors that represent local regions in the point cloud.\nThe set of feature vectors is then fed into a transformer to predict a new set\nof feature vectors for the missing region (crown). Subsequently, a point\nreconstruction head, followed by a multi-layer perceptron, is used to predict a\ndense set of points with normals. Finally, a differentiable point-to-mesh layer\nserves to reconstruct the crown surface mesh. We compare our DMC method to a\ngraph-based convolutional neural network which learns to deform a crown mesh\nfrom a generic crown shape to the target geometry. Extensive experiments on our\ndataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which attains an average\nof 0.062 Chamfer Distance.The code is available\nat:https://github.com/Golriz-code/DMC.gi",

    "abstract": "Managing the massive annual gatherings of Hajj and Umrah presents significant\nchallenges, particularly as the Saudi government aims to increase the number of\npilgrims. Currently, around two million pilgrims attend Hajj and 26 million\nattend Umrah making crowd control especially in critical areas like the Grand\nMosque during Tawaf, a major concern. Additional risks arise in managing dense\ncrowds at key sites such as Arafat where the potential for stampedes, fires and\npandemics poses serious threats to public safety. This research proposes a\nmachine learning model to classify crowd density into three levels: moderate\ncrowd, overcrowded and very dense crowd in video frames recorded during Hajj,\nwith a flashing red light to alert organizers in real-time when a very dense\ncrowd is detected. While current research efforts in processing Hajj\nsurveillance videos focus solely on using CNN to detect abnormal behaviors,\nthis research focuses more on high-risk crowds that can lead to disasters.\nHazardous crowd conditions require a robust method, as incorrect classification\ncould trigger unnecessary alerts and government intervention, while failure to\nclassify could result in disaster. The proposed model integrates Local Binary\nPattern (LBP) texture analysis, which enhances feature extraction for\ndifferentiating crowd density levels, along with edge density and area-based\nfeatures. The model was tested on the KAU-Smart Crowd 'HAJJv2' dataset which\ncontains 18 videos from various key locations during Hajj including 'Massaa',\n'Jamarat', 'Arafat' and 'Tawaf'. The model achieved an accuracy rate of 87%\nwith a 2.14% error percentage (misclassification rate), demonstrating its\nability to detect and classify various crowd conditions effectively. That\ncontributes to enhanced crowd management and safety during large-scale events\nlike Hajj.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in comprehending and generating natural language content,\nattracting widespread attention in both industry and academia. An increasing\nnumber of services offer LLMs for various tasks via APIs. Different LLMs\ndemonstrate expertise in different domains of queries (e.g., text\nclassification queries). Meanwhile, LLMs of different scales, complexities, and\nperformance are priced diversely. Driven by this, several researchers are\ninvestigating strategies for selecting an ensemble of LLMs, aiming to decrease\noverall usage costs while enhancing performance. However, to the best of our\nknowledge, none of the existing works addresses the problem, how to find an LLM\nensemble subject to a cost budget, which maximizes the ensemble performance\nwith guarantees.\n  In this paper, we formalize the performance of an ensemble of models (LLMs)\nusing the notion of correctness probability, which we formally define. We\ndevelop an approach for aggregating responses from multiple LLMs to enhance\nensemble performance. Building on this, we formulate the Optimal Ensemble\nSelection problem of selecting a set of LLMs subject to a cost budget that\nmaximizes the overall correctness probability. We show that the correctness\nprobability function is non-decreasing and non-submodular and provide evidence\nthat the Optimal Ensemble Selection problem is likely to be NP-hard. By\nleveraging a submodular function that upper bounds correctness probability, we\ndevelop an algorithm called ThriftLLM and prove that it achieves an\ninstance-dependent approximation guarantee with high probability. Our framework\nfunctions as a data processing system that selects appropriate LLM operators to\ndeliver high-quality results under budget constraints.",

    "abstract": "Chronic itch affects 13% of the US population, is highly debilitating, and\nunderlies many medical conditions. A major challenge in clinical care and new\ntherapeutics development is the lack of an objective measure for quantifying\nitch, leading to reliance on subjective measures like patients' self-assessment\nof itch severity. In this paper, we show that a home radio device paired with\nartificial intelligence (AI) can concurrently capture scratching and evaluate\nits impact on sleep quality by analyzing radio signals bouncing in the\nenvironment. The device eliminates the need for wearable sensors or skin\ncontact, enabling monitoring of chronic itch over extended periods at home\nwithout burdening patients or interfering with their skin condition. To\nvalidate the technology, we conducted an observational clinical study of\nchronic pruritus patients, monitored at home for one month using both the radio\ndevice and an infrared camera. Comparing the output of the device to ground\ntruth data from the camera demonstrates its feasibility and accuracy (ROC AUC =\n0.997, sensitivity = 0.825, specificity = 0.997). The results reveal a\nsignificant correlation between scratching and low sleep quality, manifested as\na reduction in sleep efficiency (R = 0.6, p < 0.001) and an increase in sleep\nlatency (R = 0.68, p < 0.001). Our study underscores the potential of passive,\nlong-term, at-home monitoring of chronic scratching and its sleep implications,\noffering a valuable tool for both clinical care of chronic itch patients and\npharmaceutical clinical trials.",

To showcase\nthis rarely explored front, this paper presents how ML can be successfully\nintegrated into various engineering problems by means of formulation via\ndeduction, induction, and abduction. Then, this paper identifies three\nprincipal paradoxes that could arise when adopting ML: analysis paralysis\n(increased prediction accuracy leading to a reduced understanding of physical\nmechanisms), infeasible solutions (optimization resulting in unconventional\ndesigns that challenge engineering intuition), and the Rashomon effect (where\ncontradictions in explainability methods and physics arise).
