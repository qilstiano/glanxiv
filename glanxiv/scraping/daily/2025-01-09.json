    "abstract": "In recent years, U.S. Department of Transportation has adopts Institute of\nElectrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1609 series to build the security\ncredential management system (SCMS) for being the standard of connected cars in\nU.S. Furthermore, a butterfly key expansion (BKE) method in SCMS has been\ndesigned to provide pseudonym certificates for improving the privacy of\nconnected cars. However, the BKE method is designed based on elliptic curve\ncryptography (ECC) in the standard of IEEE 1609.2.1, but more execution time is\nrequired for key expansion. Therefore, this study proposes an original\nefficient key expansion method, and the mathematical principles have been\nproposed to prove the encryption/decryption feasibility, car privacy, and\nmethod efficiency. In a practical environment, the proposed method improves the\nefficiency of key expansion method in IEEE 1609.2.1-2022 with the same security\nstrength thousands of times.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring the privacy of votes in an election is crucial for the integrity of\na democratic process. Often, voting power is delegated to representatives\n(e.g., in congress) who subsequently vote on behalf of voters on specific\nissues. This delegation model is also widely used in Decentralized Autonomous\nOrganizations (DAOs). Although several existing voting systems used in DAOs\nsupport private voting, they only offer public delegation. In this paper, we\nintroduce Kite, a new protocol that enables $\\textit{private}$ delegation of\nvoting power for DAO members. Voters can freely delegate, revoke, and\nre-delegate their power without revealing any information about who they\ndelegated to. Even the delegate does not learn who delegated to them. The only\ninformation that is recorded publicly is that the voter delegated or\nre-delegated their vote to someone. Kite accommodates both public and private\nvoting for the delegates themselves. We analyze the security of our protocol\nwithin the Universal Composability (UC) framework. We implement Kite as an\nextension to the existing Governor Bravo smart contract on the Ethereum\nblockchain, that is widely used for DAO governance. Furthermore, we provide an\nevaluation of our implementation that demonstrates the practicality of the\nprotocol. The most expensive operation is delegation due to the required\nzero-knowledge proofs. On a consumer-grade laptop, delegation takes between 7\nand 167 seconds depending on the requested level of privacy.",

In this paper, we conduct a case study to investigate the\ncapability of using LLMs, particularly GPT-4o, for field of view (FOV) analysis\nin VR exploration testing. Specifically, we validate that LLMs can identify\ntest entities in FOVs and that prompt engineering can effectively enhance the\naccuracy of test entity identification from 41.67% to 71.30%. Our study also\nshows that LLMs can accurately describe identified entities' features with at\nleast a 90% accuracy rate. We further find out that the core features that\neffectively represent an entity are color, placement, and shape. Furthermore,\nthe combination of the three features can especially be used to improve the\naccuracy of determining identical entities in multiple FOVs with the highest\nF1-score of 0.70. Additionally, our study demonstrates that LLMs are capable of\nscene recognition and spatial understanding in VR with precisely designed\nstructured prompts.

    "abstract": "We introduce a quadratically-constrained approximation (QCAC) of the AC\noptimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem. Unlike existing approximations like the\nDC-OPF, our model does not rely on typical assumptions such as high\nreactance-to-resistance ratio, near-nominal voltage magnitudes, or small angle\ndifferences, and preserves the structural sparsity of the original AC power\nflow equations, making it suitable for decentralized power systems optimization\nproblems. To achieve this, we reformulate the AC-OPF problem as a quadratically\nconstrained quadratic program. The nonconvex terms are expressed as differences\nof convex functions, which are then convexified around a base point derived\nfrom a warm start of the nodal voltages. If this linearization results in a\nnon-empty constraint set, the convexified constraints form an inner convex\napproximation. Our experimental results, based on Power Grid Library instances\nof up to 30,000 buses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the QCAC approximation\nwith respect to other well-documented conic relaxations and a linear\napproximation. We further showcase its potential advantages over the\nwell-documented second-order conic relaxation of the power flow equations in\ntwo proof-of-concept case studies: optimal reactive power dispatch in\ntransmission networks and PV hosting capacity in distribution grids.",

    "abstract": "Assistive mobile robots are a transformative technology that helps persons\nwith disabilities regain the ability to move freely. Although autonomous\nwheelchairs significantly reduce user effort, they still require human input to\nallow users to maintain control and adapt to changing environments. Brain\nComputer Interface (BCI) stands out as a highly user-friendly option that does\nnot require physical movement. Current BCI systems can understand whether users\nwant to accelerate or decelerate, but they implement these changes in discrete\nspeed steps rather than allowing for smooth, continuous velocity adjustments.\nThis limitation prevents the systems from mimicking the natural, fluid speed\nchanges seen in human self-paced motion. The authors aim to address this\nlimitation by redesigning the perception-action cycle in a BCI controlled\nrobotic system: improving how the robotic agent interprets the user's motion\nintentions (world state) and implementing these actions in a way that better\nreflects natural physical properties of motion, such as inertia and damping.\nThe scope of this paper focuses on the perception aspect. We asked and answered\na normative question \"what computation should the robotic agent carry out to\noptimally perceive incomplete or noisy sensory observations?\" Empirical EEG\ndata were collected, and probabilistic representation that served as world\nstate distributions were learned and evaluated in a Generative Adversarial\nNetwork framework. The ROS framework was established that connected with a\nGazebo environment containing a digital twin of an indoor space and a virtual\nmodel of a robotic wheelchair. Signal processing and statistical analyses were\nimplemented to identity the most discriminative features in the\nspatial-spectral-temporal dimensions, which are then used to construct the\nworld model for the robotic agent to interpret user motion intentions as a\nBayesian observer.",

    "abstract": "Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum\nspins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute\nzero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant\nfractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter\nphysics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials.\nThis field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations,\ntopological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the\nKitaev model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare\nexactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin\ndegrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an\napplied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically\nnon-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering\npotential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian\ncharacter of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection\nto certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum\nHall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could\nmanifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and\nruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In\nparticular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and\ntopological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator\nRuCl3. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This\nreview begins with a brief review on QSLs in other systems, followed by a\ncomprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a\nparticular focus on RuCl3. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is\nto inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current\nliterature and perspectives.",

The PRM integrates information on the instantaneous attitude\nprovided by the telescope control system to determine the actual pointing\ndirection and focal plane orientation of the telescope. It accounts for various\nnon-idealities in the telescope setup, represented by eight configuration\nangles, which will be calibrated using the Star Tracker. Following the\nderivation of the PRM formalism and its implementation, we investigate the\npointing errors caused by incorrect calibration of these configuration angles\nto validate the required 1 arcminute maximum systematic pointing error for the\nLSPE-Strip survey. This paper also describes the main structure and operations\nof the Star Tracker and presents the results of a campaign of actual sky\nobservations conducted with a prototype. The results demonstrate a Star Tracker\nRMS accuracy of approximately 3 arcseconds, while systematic errors remain\nbelow 10 arcseconds. Based on these results, we analyzed the problem of\nreconstructing the PRM configuration angles. Two methods for intercalibrating\nthe Star Tracker's pointing direction with respect to the focal plane's\npointing direction were examined: (1) observations of planets and (2)\nobservations of a drone carrying both an optical beacon and a radio beacon. In\nthe first case, an intercalibration accuracy between 1/3 arcminute and 1\narcminute is achievable. In the second case, the expected intercalibration\naccuracy ranges from 0.25 arcminute to 1 arcminute.",

Traditional tools used for periodic\nsearches, such as the periodogram, have poorly defined statistical properties\nunder irregular sampling, which complicate inferring the underlying aperiodic\nvariability used for hypothesis testing. The problem is exacerbated in the\npresence of stochastic variability, which can be easily mistaken by genuine\nperiodic behaviour, particularly in the case of poorly sampled lightcurves.\nHere we present a method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) modelling for period\nsearches and characterization, specifically developed to overcome these\nproblems. We argue that in cases of irregularly-sampled time series, GPs offer\nan appealing alternative to traditional periodograms, because the known\ndistribution of the data (correlated Gaussian) allows a well-defined likelihood\nto be constructed. We exploit this property and draw from existing statistical\nmethods to perform traditional likelihood ratio tests for an additional,\n(quasi-)periodic component, using the aperiodic variability inferred from the\ndata as the null hypothesis. Inferring the noise from the data allows the\nmethod to be fully generalizable, with the only condition that the data can be\ndescribed as a Gaussian process. We demonstrate the method by applying it to a\nvariety of objects showing varying levels of noise and data quality.\nLimitations of the method are discussed and a package implementing the proposed\nmethodology is made publicly available.",

The novel test appears\nto be well calibrated, much better than the Little's MCAR test that was used as\na benchmark. For the alternatives that were detectable for the old test, the\nnovel test has comparable, although slightly lower, power as the old one, but\nis still able to outperform Little's test in all of the studied scenarios. For\nalternatives that were previously undetectable or barely detectable, the novel\ntest performs the best of three. The novel test has the same assumption of\nfinite fourth moments of the data, the same assumption necessary for Little's\ntest.

The LiteBIRD\nsingle-stage SQUID Array is required to have high transimpedance amplification\nwhile maintaining a low input inductance and low dynamic resistance.

    "abstract": "Occupational data play a vital role in research, official statistics, and\npolicymaking, yet their collection and accurate classification remain a\nchallenge. This study investigates the effects of occupational question wording\non data variability and the performance of automatic coding tools. We conducted\nand replicated a split-ballot survey experiment in Germany using two common\noccupational question formats: one focusing on 'job title' (Berufsbezeichnung)\nand another on 'occupational tasks' (berufliche T\\\"atigkeit). Our analysis\nreveals that automatic coding tools, such as CASCOT and OccuCoDe, exhibit\nsensitivity to the form and origin of the data. Specifically, these tools were\nmore efficient when coding responses to the job title question format compared\nwith the occupational task format, suggesting a potential way to improve the\nrespective questions for many German surveys. In a subsequent 'detailed tasks\nand duties' question, providing a guiding example prompted respondents to give\nlonger answers without broadening the range of unique words they used. These\nfindings highlight the importance of harmonising survey questions and of\nensuring that automatic coding tools are robust to differences in question\nwording. We emphasise the need for further research to optimise question design\nand coding tools for greater accuracy and applicability in occupational data\ncollection.",

One key\nchallenge in the MPI image reconstruction task arises from its underlying noise\nmodel, which does not fulfill the implicit Gaussian assumptions that are made\nwhen applying traditional reconstruction approaches. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce the Learned Discrepancy Approach, a novel learning-based\nreconstruction method for inverse problems that includes a learned discrepancy\nfunction. It enhances traditional techniques by incorporating an invertible\nneural network to explicitly model problem-specific noise distributions. This\napproach does not rely on implicit Gaussian noise assumptions, making it\nespecially suited to handle the sophisticated noise model in MPI and also\napplicable to other inverse problems. To further advance MPI reconstruction\ntechniques, we introduce the MPI-MNIST dataset - a large collection of\nsimulated MPI measurements derived from the MNIST dataset of handwritten\ndigits. The dataset includes noise-perturbed measurements generated from\nstate-of-the-art model-based system matrices and measurements of a preclinical\nMPI scanner device. This provides a realistic and flexible environment for\nalgorithm testing. Validated against the MPI-MNIST dataset, our method\ndemonstrates significant improvements in reconstruction quality in terms of\nstructural similarity when compared to classical reconstruction techniques.",

There is\ngrowing interest in the study of their properties to investigate stellar and\nsupernova feedback. So far, the detection of cavities in observational and\nnumerical data is mostly done visually and, hence, is prone to biases.\nTherefore, we present an automated, objective method for discovering cavities\nin particle simulations, with demonstrations using hydrodynamical simulations\nof a dwarf galaxy. The suggested technique extracts holes based on the\npersistent homology of particle positions and identifies tight boundary points\naround each. With a synthetic ground-truth analysis, we investigate the\nrelationship between data density and the detection radius, demonstrating that\nhigher data density also allows for the robust detection of smaller cavities.\nBy tracking the boundary points, we can measure the shape and physical\nproperties of the cavity, such as its temperature. In this contribution, we\ndetect 808 holes in 21 simulation snapshots. We classified the holes into\nsupernova-blown bubbles and cavities unrelated to stellar feedback activity\nbased on their temperature profile and expansion behaviour during the 100\nmillion years covered by the simulation snapshots analysed for this work.\nSurprisingly, less than 40% of the detected cavities can unequivocally be\nlinked to stellar evolution. Moreover, about 36% of the cavities are\ncontracting, while 59% are expanding. The rest do not change for a few million\nyears. Clearly, it is erroneous to interpret observational data based on the\npremise that all cavities are supernova-related and expanding. This study\nreveals that supernova-driven bubbles typically exhibit smaller diameters,\nlarger expansion velocities, and lower kinetic ages (with a maximum of 220\nmillion years) compared to other cavities.",

The source is known to exhibit strong excess soft X-ray\nemission, which we show is well represented by thermal disk photons Comptonized\nby a warm plasma spanning the inner accretion flow. Additionally, the EPIC-pn\ndata provide compelling evidence ($\\Delta C\\sim60$ for 4 additional parameters)\nfor the presence of an ultrafast outflow (UFO) with a line-of-sight velocity\n$v/c=0.307^{+0.001}_{-0.005}$, and an emission signature consistent with\nreflection of the corona from modestly ionized, outflowing gas. The\nsimultaneous $0.5-2.5$\\,keV RGS spectra show clear absorption lines. Modelling\nof these data confirms the presence of the UFO and constrains its equivalent\nhydrogen column density, log $N_\\mathrm{H}/$(atom cm$^{-2}$) =\n$21.7^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$. The RGS data also reveal at least two warm absorber\ncomponents with a modest outflow velocity ($1680^{+40}_{-50}$ km/s). The\nmeasured properties and time evolution of the UFO in REJ1034+396 suggest that\nit is formed from collisionally ionized plasma, launched from the disk surface\nand accelerated by radiation pressure. The high terminal velocity and\nsubstantial absorbing column density imply that the outflow carries sufficient\nmomentum and energy to transform its environment, being capable of driving out\nessentially all dust and gas it interacts with along the line of sight, even if\nthe AGN were initially surrounded by a Compton thick absorber.",

    "abstract": "The reionization of helium is thought to occur at $2.5\\lesssim z\\lesssim4$,\nmarking the last phase transition and final global heating event of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM). Since it is driven by rare quasars, helium\nreionization should give rise to strong temperature fluctuations in the IGM\nbetween neutral and recently-ionized regions of order $\\sigma (\\ln T) \\sim\n\\Delta T/T = 20-50\\%$. We introduce a novel method to search for\nreionization-induced temperature fluctuations in the IGM by using the effective\noptical depths of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest towards a large number of\nbackground quasars. Higher IGM temperatures give rise to lower effective\noptical depths in the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest, implying that temperature\nfluctuations will broaden the observed optical depth distribution. We measured\nthe distributions of effective Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest optical depths across $71$\nX-Shooter spectra from the XQ-100 survey in four redshift bins from $z=3.76$ to\n$z=4.19$ and compared them to a large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulation. A good agreement is found between the observations and the\nsimulation, which does not include temperature fluctuations; therefore, we do\nnot detect a signature of helium reionization. We then post-process the\nsimulations to include an increasing amount of temperature fluctuations until\nthe model becomes inconsistent with the observations. We obtain tight\nconstraints on $\\sigma (\\ln T) < 0.29 \\ (<0.40)$ at $2 \\sigma\\ (3 \\sigma)$ at\n$z=3.76$ when averaging over scales of $100$ comoving Mpc, and weaker\nconstraints for higher redshifts and smaller scales.

    "abstract": "Space-based experiments, either orbiting the Earth or from scientific balloon\naltitudes, measure high-energy cosmic rays by measuring from above the\natmosphere the optical and radio signals generated by extensive air showers\n(EAS). These experiments are designed to have a large field-of-view (FoV) for\nobserving EAS which translates to monitoring the atmosphere over a large, $\\sim\n10^6$ km$^2$ area on the ground. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, $E_{CR}\n> ~\\sim 1$ EeV) are measured by using the isotropic near-UV air fluorescence\nsignal to finely sample the EAS development and to efficiently use the\natmosphere as a vast calorimeter. At UHE, these immense EAS particle cascades\nhave sufficient charged particle content to generate the relatively dim\nfluorescence light that propagates to the space-based instrument. Additionally,\nthe beamed Cherenkov light and geomagnetic radio emission from EAS arrive with\n$> ~\\sim 10$ ns impulse and are measured at small angles away from the cosmic\nray trajectories. In particular for optical Cherenkov measurements, the energy\nthresholds can be $> ~\\sim 1$ PeV, i.e. for very-high energy cosmic rays\n(VHECRs). ...\n  In this chapter, the nature of observing the UHECR-induced shower development\nfrom orbiting and balloon-borne experiments is detailed, both for missions that\nhave been flown and those currently in development. This will be accomplished\nby discussing experimental performance in terms of measuring the UHECR\nspectrum, UHECR nuclear composition, and UHECR arrival direction. The ability\nfor these experiments to also perform VHECR and VHE and UHE cosmic neutrino\nmeasurements will also be discussed.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the instabilities during the axisymmetric inflation of an\ninitially spherical magnetoelastic balloon, modeled as a magnetizable Ogden\nmaterial, under combined internal pressure and a non-uniform magnetic field\ngenerated by current-carrying coils. The nonlinear interplay of geometric and\nmaterial effects leads to governing equations sensitive to bifurcations and\ninstabilities. A coordinate singularity at the poles of the balloon is\nidentified within the system of governing differential equations, which is\nresolved through an appropriate choice of field variables and L'H\\^opital's\nrule. Stability analysis reveals that as inflation progresses, axisymmetry is\nbroken through a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation, resulting in a\npear-shaped equilibrium. This symmetry is later restored through a reverse\nsubcritical pitchfork bifurcation, forming an isolated loop of pear-shaped\nsolutions containing stable and unstable branches in the case of a\nsix-parameter Ogden material model (SPOM). The onset of symmetry-breaking\nbifurcations is influenced by material parameters and magnetic field intensity,\nwith critical values beyond which such bifurcations are suppressed. Both\nsymmetry-preserving and pear-shaped configurations are stable under small\nasymmetric perturbations in both magnetic and non-magnetic cases. Snap-through\ntransitions between pear-shaped and axisymmetric configurations are also\nobserved.",

By employing a non-Gaussian variational approach, we go\nbeyond the approximation of a constant superconducting (SC) gap. We show that\ndynamical properties of the system can be modified qualitatively, when space\nand time dependent renormalization of the SC gap and electron-impurity\nhybridization are included. For the ground state, we find the singlet-doublet\nphase transition and $\\pi$-phase shifts of the SC order parameter. For\ndynamics, first we consider spin dynamics following an abrupt connection of the\npolarized impurity to the 2D bath. We find rapid relaxation of impurity\npolarization and directional emission of a magnetization pulse, which becomes\ndamped as it propagates into the bulk. Then we analyze transport between two SC\nleads coupled through the impurity at finite bias voltage. Here we go beyond\nanalysis of the steady state to investigate full-time dynamics following an\nabrupt application of the bias voltage. We uncover four distinct regimes in the\ntransient dynamics and transport properties: (I) the AC Josephson effect\nregime; (II) dynamical competition between charge-density-wave (CDW) and SC\norders with transient Kondo correlations; (III) the coexistence of AC and DC\ncurrents facilitated by partial Kondo screening and dynamical stabilization of\nthe SC order; (IV) DC Kondo transport regime modified by the SC order. Regime\nII exhibits a dynamical transition from SC to CDW order that locally restores\nthe U(1) symmetry.

    "abstract": "Material flow analyses (MFAs) provide insight into supply chain level\nopportunities for resource efficiency. MFAs can be represented as networks with\nnodes that represent materials, processes, sectors or locations. MFA network\nstructure uncertainty (i.e., the existence or absence of flows between nodes)\nis pervasive and can undermine the reliability of the flow predictions. This\narticle investigates MFA network structure uncertainty by proposing candidate\nnode-and-flow structures and using Bayesian model selection to identify the\nmost suitable structures and Bayesian model averaging to quantify the\nparametric mass flow uncertainty. The results of this holistic approach to MFA\nuncertainty are used in conjunction with the input-output (I/O) method to make\nrisk-informed resource efficiency recommendation. These techniques are\ndemonstrated using a case study on the U.S. steel sector where 16 candidate\nstructures are considered. Model selection highlights 2 networks as most\nprobable based on data collected from the United States Geological Survey and\nthe World Steel Association. Using the I/O method, we then show that the\nconstruction sector accounts for the greatest mean share of domestic U.S. steel\nindustry emissions while the automotive and steel products sectors have the\nhighest mean emissions per unit of steel used in the end-use sectors. The\nuncertainty in the results is used to analyze which end-use sector should be\nthe focus of demand reduction efforts under different appetites for risk. This\narticle's methods generate holistic and transparent MFA uncertainty that\naccount for structural uncertainty, enabling decisions whose outcomes are more\nrobust to the uncertainty.",

Existing change-detection approaches suffer from three\nmajor limitations: (1) lack of evaluation on image pairs that contain no\nchanges, leading to unreported false positive rates; (2) lack of\ncorrespondences (i.e., localizing the regions before and after a change); and\n(3) poor zero-shot generalization across different domains. To address these\nissues, we introduce a novel method that leverages change correspondences (a)\nduring training to improve change detection accuracy, and (b) at test time, to\nminimize false positives. That is, we harness the supervision labels of where\nan object is added or removed to supervise change detectors, improving their\naccuracy over previous work by a large margin. Our work is also the first to\npredict correspondences between pairs of detected changes using estimated\nhomography and the Hungarian algorithm.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an embedding-based approach for solving switched optimal\ncontrol problems (SOCPs) with dwell time constraints. At first, an embedded\noptimal control problem (EOCP) is defined by replacing the discrete switching\nsignal with a continuous embedded variable that can take intermediate values\nbetween the discrete modes. While embedding enables solutions of SOCPs via\nconventional techniques, optimal solutions of EOCPs often involve nonexistent\nmodes and thus may not be feasible for the SOCP. In the modified EOCP (MEOCP),\na concave function is added to the cost function to enforce a bang-bang\nsolution in the embedded variable, which results in feasible solutions for the\nSOCP. However, the MEOCP cannot guarantee the satisfaction of dwell-time\nconstraints.\n  In this paper, a MEOCP is combined with a filter layer to remove switching\ntimes that violate the dwell time constraint. Insertion gradients are used to\nminimize the effect of the filter on the optimal cost.",

This research aims to provide a standard Marxist\ndecision criterion regarding the inclusion and exclusion of economic activities\nfor the calculation of the Marxist average profit rate for the case of United\nStates economic sectors from 1960 to 2020, based on the Marxist definition of\nproductive labor, its location in the circuit of capital, and its relationship\nwith the production of surplus value.

The system is\nmeticulously designed to function as an experimental instrument rather than a\nconventional chatbot, necessitating users to input a username and experiment\ncode upon access. This setup facilitates precise data cross-referencing,\nthereby augmenting the integrity and applicability of the data collected for\nresearch purposes. It can be easily expanded to accommodate new basic events as\nneeded; and it allows researchers to integrate their own logging events without\nthe necessity of implementing a separate logging mechanism. It is worth noting\nthat our system was built to assist primarily behavioral science research but\nis not limited to it, it can easily be adapted to assist information retrieval\nresearch or interacting with chat bot agents in general.",

By using a logistic classifier to\ncalculate the probability of assignment between the control and experimental\ngroups a log odds value or 'logit' score is assigned to each data point. After\nassignment of a logit score every data point in the treatment group is assigned\na comparable control in order to balance the potential confounding variables of\nan experiment. While a viable inference technique, many implementations of PSM\nfail to properly outline the methodology used, such as not explaining feature\nselection and matching techniques. This paper outlines multiple different\ntechniques for both feature selection and matching which then are compared\nbased on their efficiency. Three unique quantitative feature selection methods\nwere utilized including random removal, feature importance calculation, and\nindividual removal. Individual removal was the most efficient in consolidating\nthe overlap between the treatment and control groups. The matching techniques\nused were bisect, binary insertion, nearest neighbors, and the most efficient,\nnearest neighbor with a caliper, in order to limit the error percentage and\nstandard mean deviation. Only testing these techniques on a data set that\nincluded patients treated with semaglutide makes it not possible to\ndefinitively state which technique is the best.

    "abstract": "In this work, we present novel randomized compression algorithms for flat\nrank-structured matrices with shared bases, known as uniform Block Low-Rank\n(BLR) matrices. Our main contribution is a technique called tagging, which\nimproves upon the efficiency of basis matrix computation while preserving\naccuracy compared to alternative methods. Tagging operates on the matrix using\nmatrix-vector products of the matrix and its adjoint, making it particularly\nadvantageous in scenarios where accessing individual matrix entries is\ncomputationally expensive or infeasible.\n  Flat rank-structured formats use subblock sizes that asymptotically scale\nwith the matrix size to ensure competitive complexities for linear algebraic\noperations, making alternative methods prohibitively expensive in such\nscenarios. In contrast, tagging reconstructs basis matrices using a constant\nnumber of matrix-vector products followed by linear post-processing, with the\nconstants determined by the rank parameter and the problem's underlying\ngeometric properties.\n  We provide a detailed analysis of the asymptotic complexity of tagging,\ndemonstrating its ability to significantly reduce computational costs without\nsacrificing accuracy. We also establish a theoretical connection between the\noptimal construction of tagging matrices and projective varieties in algebraic\ngeometry, suggesting a hybrid numeric-symbolic avenue of future work.\n  To validate our approach, we apply tagging to compress uniform BLR matrices\narising from the discretization of integral and partial differential equations.\nEmpirical results show that tagging outperforms alternative compression\ntechniques, significantly reducing both the number of required matrix-vector\nproducts and overall computational time. These findings highlight the\npracticality and scalability of tagging as an efficient method for flat\nrank-structured matrices in scientific computing.",

    "abstract": "To ensure resilience against the unavoidable noise in quantum computers,\nquantum information needs to be encoded using an error-correcting code, and\ncircuits must have a particular structure to be fault-tolerant. Compilation of\nfault-tolerant quantum circuits is thus inherently different from the\nnon-fault-tolerant case. However, automated fault-tolerant compilation methods\nare widely underexplored, and most known constructions are obtained manually\nfor specific codes only. In this work, we focus on the problem of automatically\nsynthesizing fault-tolerant circuits for the deterministic initialization of an\nencoded state for a broad class of quantum codes that are realizable on current\nand near-term hardware.\n  To this end, we utilize methods based on techniques from classical circuit\ndesign, such as satisfiability solving, resulting in tools for the synthesis of\n(optimal) fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for near-term quantum\ncodes. We demonstrate the correct fault-tolerant behavior of the synthesized\ncircuits using circuit-level noise simulations.

    "abstract": "Motor execution, a fundamental aspect of human behavior, has been extensively\nstudied using BCI technologies. EEG and fNIRS have been utilized to provide\nvaluable insights, but their individual limitations have hindered performance.\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of fusing electroencephalography\n(EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data for classifying\nrest versus task states in a motor execution paradigm. Using the SMR Hybrid BCI\ndataset, this work compares unimodal (EEG and fNIRS) classifiers with a\nmultimodal fusion approach. It proposes Motor Execution using Convolutional\nAdditive Self-Attention Mechanisms (MECASA), a novel architecture leveraging\nconvolutional operations and self-attention to capture complex patterns in\nmultimodal data. MECASA, built upon the CAS-ViT architecture, employs a\ncomputationally efficient, convolutional-based self-attention module (CASA), a\nhybrid block design, and a dedicated fusion network to combine features from\nseparate EEG and fNIRS processing streams. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat MECASA consistently outperforms established methods across all modalities\n(EEG, fNIRS, and fused), with fusion consistently improving accuracy compared\nto single-modality approaches. fNIRS generally achieved higher accuracy than\nEEG alone. Ablation studies revealed optimal configurations for MECASA, with\nembedding dimensions of 64-128 providing the best performance for EEG data and\nOD128 (upsampled optical density) yielding superior results for fNIRS data.\nThis work highlights the potential of deep learning, specifically MECASA, to\nenhance EEG-fNIRS fusion for BCI applications.",

It is based on the working knowledge and best practices\ndeveloped by the Access Network, a collection of nine student-led communities\nat universities across the country working towards a vision of a more diverse,\nequitable, inclusive, and accessible STEM environment. Many of these\ncommunities, also referred to as sites, include a near-peer mentoring program\nthat is developed to best support their local context. The format of these\nprograms vary, ranging from structured classes with peer mentoring groups to\nstudent clubs supporting 1-on-1 relationships. To further support program\nparticipants as both students and as whole people, sites often run additional\nevents such as lecture series, workshops, and social activities guided tailored\nto each student community's needs. Through this process, student leaders have\ngenerated and honed best practices for all aspects of running their sites. This\nguide is an attempt to synthesize those efforts, offering practical advice for\nstudent leaders setting up near-peer mentorship programs in their own\ndepartments. It has been written through the lens of undergraduate near-peer\nmentorship programs, although our framework could easily be extended to other\ndemographics (e.g. high schoolers, graduate students, etc.). Our experience is\nwith STEM mentorship specifically, though these practices can extend to any\ndiscipline. In this document, we outline best practices for designing, running,\nand sustaining near-peer mentorship programs. We provide template resources to\nassist with this work, and lesson plans to run mentor and mentee training\nsessions. We hope you find this guide useful in designing, implementing, and\nre-evaluating community oriented near-peer mentoring programs.",

In\nthe MSG model, we aim to couple the MARCS 1D radiative-convective equilibrium\natmosphere model with the 1D kinetic, stationary, non-equilibrium, cloud\nformation model DRIFT, to create a new grid of self-consistent cloudy\nsubstellar atmosphere models with microphysical cloud formation.

We compute atmospheric structures\nthat self-consistently account for condensate cloud opacities based on\nmicrophysical properties. We present an algorithm based on control theory to\nhelp converge such self-consistent models. Synthetic atmosphere spectra are\ncomputed for each model to explore the observable impact of the cloud\nmicrophysics. We additionally explore the impact of choosing different\nnucleation species (TiO$_2$ or SiO) and the effect of less efficient\natmospheric mixing on these spectra. The new MSG cloudy grid using TiO$_2$\nnucleation shows spectra which are redder in the near-infrared compared to the\ncurrently known population of substellar atmospheres. We find the models with\nSiO nucleation, and models with reduced mixing efficiency are less red in the\nnear-infrared.

In total, eighteen sources\nwere observed: the main science targets, Sgr A* and M87 along with various\ncalibrators. We investigated the morphology of the sixteen AGN in the EHT 2017\ndata set, focusing on the properties of the VLBI cores: size, flux density, and\nbrightness temperature. We studied their dependence on the observing frequency\nin order to compare it with the Blandford-K\\\"onigl (BK) jet model. We modeled\nthe source structure of seven AGN in the EHT 2017 data set using linearly\npolarized circular Gaussian components and collected results for the other nine\nAGN from dedicated EHT publications, complemented by lower frequency data in\nthe 2-86 GHz range. Then, we studied the dependences of the VLBI core flux\ndensity, size, and brightness temperature on the frequency measured in the AGN\nhost frame. We compared the observations with the BK jet model and estimated\nthe magnetic field strength dependence on the distance from the central black\nhole. Our results indicate a deviation from the standard BK model, particularly\nin the decrease of the brightness temperature with the observing frequency.\nEither bulk acceleration of the jet material, energy transfer from the magnetic\nfield to the particles, or both are required to explain the observations.",

High\nangular resolution ALMA observations allow deep kinematical analysis of disks,\nby observing molecular line emission at high spectral resolution. In\nparticular, rotation curves are key tools for studying the disk pressure\nstructure and estimating fundamental disk parameters, such as mass and radius.\nIn this work, we explore the potential of a multi-molecule approach to gas\nkinematics to provide a 2D characterization of the HD 163296 disk. From the\nhigh quality data of the MAPS Large Program we extracted the rotation curves of\nrotational lines from seven distinct molecular species, spanning a wide radial\nand vertical range. To obtain reliable rotation curves for hyperfine lines, we\nextended standard methodologies to fit multi-component line profiles. We then\nsampled the likelihood of a thermally stratified model that reproduces all the\nrotation curves simultaneously, taking into account the molecular emitting\nlayers and disk thermal structure. We obtained dynamical estimates of the\nstellar mass $M_\\star=1.89$ M$_\\odot$, the disk mass $M_\\text{d}=0.12$\nM$_\\odot$, and scale radius $R_\\text{c}=143$ au. We also explore how rotation\ncurves and the parameter estimates depend on the adopted emitting layers: the\ndisk mass proves to be the most affected by these systematics, yet the main\ntrends we find do not depend on the adopted parameterization. Finally, we\ninvestigated the impact of thermal structure on gas kinematics, showing that\nthe thermal stratification can efficiently explain the measured rotation\nvelocity discrepancies between tracers at different heights. Our results show\nthat such a multi-molecule approach, tracing a large range of emission layers,\ncan provide unique constraints on the ($R,z$) pressure structure of\nprotoplanetary disks.",

To properly engineer such sources, a reliable model describing\nnano- and micrometer-scale SPDC is necessary; however, such a theoretical\ndescription remains a challenge. Here, we propose and derive a simplified model\nto describe SPDC in resonant structures, which considers the generation of\nphoton pairs and the resonant enhancement of spectral bands to be separate\nprocesses, even though they actually occur simultaneously. We compare our\nsimplified model to both the rigorous theory of SPDC in an etalon - a simple\nexample of a resonant structure - and our experiments on SPDC in etalons and\nfind agreement for low-gain SPDC. By simplifying the calculations required to\ngenerate photon pairs, our model promises to make designing complex resonant\nstructures easier, and it promises to hasten the iteration of designs across\nthe field of quantum state engineering.",

We use new James Webb Space Telescope\n(JWST) NIRCam imaging to study the morphologies and sizes of NLRs traced by [O\nIII] at cosmic noon ($z\\sim2-3$). To determine NIRCam's ability to probe the\nproperties of the NLR in cosmic noon galaxies, we present simulated images of\nAGN at $z=2-3$ created with archival data cubes from the Multi Unit\nSpectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) of nine nearby ($z<0.05$) AGN host galaxies with\npreviously confirmed extended NLRs. Our simulated images show that NIRCam is\nable to resolve the morphologies of NLRs at $z=2-3$ with narrow- and\nmedium-band observations. We then search for extended NLRs with NIRCam\nmedium-band observations targeting the [O III]$+\\mathrm{H}\\beta$ emission in\ntwenty-seven previously identified AGN at $z=2.4-3.4$ in the Great\nObservatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field.

This result, if ascribed to isotropic turbulence, implies a subsonic\nICM with Mach number M_3D = 0.22 and a non-thermal pressure fraction of\n2.6+/-0.3%. The turbulent velocity is similar to what was measured in the core\nof the Perseus cluster by Hitomi, but here in a more massive cluster with an\nICM temperature of 7 keV, the limit on non-thermal pressure fraction is even\nmore stringent. Our result is consistent with expectations from simulations of\nrelaxed clusters, but it is on the low end of the predicted distribution,\nindicating that Abell 2029 is an exceptionally relaxed cluster with no\nsignificant impacts from either a recent minor merger or AGN activity.",

To fill this gap, we present OVO-Bench\n(Online-VideO-Benchmark), a novel video benchmark that emphasizes the\nimportance of timestamps for advanced online video understanding capability\nbenchmarking. OVO-Bench evaluates the ability of video LLMs to reason and\nrespond to events occurring at specific timestamps under three distinct\nscenarios: (1) Backward tracing: trace back to past events to answer the\nquestion. (2) Real-time understanding: understand and respond to events as they\nunfold at the current timestamp. (3) Forward active responding: delay the\nresponse until sufficient future information becomes available to answer the\nquestion accurately. OVO-Bench comprises 12 tasks, featuring 644 unique videos\nand approximately human-curated 2,800 fine-grained meta-annotations with\nprecise timestamps. We combine automated generation pipelines with human\ncuration. With these high-quality samples, we further developed an evaluation\npipeline to systematically query video LLMs along the video timeline.\nEvaluations of nine Video-LLMs reveal that, despite advancements on traditional\nbenchmarks, current models struggle with online video understanding, showing a\nsignificant gap compared to human agents. We hope OVO-Bench will drive progress\nin video LLMs and inspire future research in online video reasoning. Our\nbenchmark and code can be accessed at https://github.com/JoeLeelyf/OVO-Bench.",

Two light curve dips were\nobserved; during them, the harder Comptonized spectral component was dominant\nand the polarization degree higher than in the softer, off-dip intervals.\nThrough a joint analysis of the three IXPE observations, which also included\nthe dip from the first observation, we demonstrate that the polarization\nproperties varied in response to the intensity and spectral hardness changes\nassociated with the dips. The polarization degree attained values up to ~4%.\nThe polarization angle showed a swing of ~70{\\deg} across the dip and off-dip\nstates, comparable to the continuous rotation seen during the first IXPE\nobservation. We discuss these results in the context of models for polarized\nemission from the accretion disk and the boundary/spreading layer on the\nneutron star surface. We also draw attention to the role that an extended\naccretion disk corona or disk wind can play in generating high polarization\ndegrees and, possibly, swings of the polarization angle.",

Particularly, highly eccentric\ncompanion stars risk disrupting planetary orbits, such as in the extreme system\nTOI 4633 where close encounters between the companion and a gas giant planet in\nthe habitable zone make it one of the most fragile systems discovered so far.\nHere, we report that TOI 4633's planet likely survived these encounters\nthroughout the system's age by orbiting retrograde relative to the binary,\nstabilised by the Coriolis force. Using direct $N$-body simulations, we show it\notherwise tends to collide with the binary stars or becomes free-floating after\ngetting ejected. A retrograde planetary orbit has profound implications for TOI\n4633's formation and evolution, suggesting an extraordinary history where its\neccentric companion was likely randomly captured after planet formation in a\nsingle-star system. Alternatively, if stars and planet are born in situ from\nthe same gas clump, we show the planet must have formed at sub-snow-line\ndistances, contrary to the conventional core-accretion model. Our study\nhighlights the importance of considering the long-term stability ($\\gtrsim\\rm\nGyr$) of planets in eccentric binaries and demonstrates that the mere existence\nin such dynamically hostile environments places strong constraints on their\norbital configuration and formation.",

Many MDE models aim to predict affine-invariant\nrelative depth from monocular images, while recent developments in large-scale\ntraining and vision foundation models enable reasonable estimation of metric\n(absolute) depth. However, effectively leveraging these predictions for\ngeometric vision tasks, in particular relative pose estimation, remains\nrelatively under explored. While depths provide rich constraints for cross-view\nimage alignment, the intrinsic noise and ambiguity from the monocular depth\npriors present practical challenges to improving upon classic keypoint-based\nsolutions. In this paper, we develop three solvers for relative pose estimation\nthat explicitly account for independent affine (scale and shift) ambiguities,\ncovering both calibrated and uncalibrated conditions. We further propose a\nhybrid estimation pipeline that combines our proposed solvers with classic\npoint-based solvers and epipolar constraints. We find that the affine\ncorrection modeling is beneficial to not only the relative depth priors but\nalso, surprisingly, the \"metric\" ones. Results across multiple datasets\ndemonstrate large improvements of our approach over classic keypoint-based\nbaselines and PnP-based solutions, under both calibrated and uncalibrated\nsetups. We also show that our method improves consistently with different\nfeature matchers and MDE models, and can further benefit from very recent\nadvances on both modules.

EMMA tasks demand advanced cross-modal reasoning that cannot be\naddressed by reasoning independently in each modality, offering an enhanced\ntest suite for MLLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our evaluation of\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs on EMMA reveals significant limitations in handling\ncomplex multimodal and multi-step reasoning tasks, even with advanced\ntechniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and test-time compute scaling\nunderperforming. These findings underscore the need for improved multimodal\narchitectures and training paradigms to close the gap between human and model\nreasoning in multimodality.",

However, extending state-of-the-art video tokenizers to achieve a\ntemporal compression ratio beyond 4x without increasing channel capacity poses\nsignificant challenges. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to\nenhance temporal compression. We find that the reconstruction quality of\ntemporally subsampled videos from a low-compression encoder surpasses that of\nhigh-compression encoders applied to original videos. This indicates that\nhigh-compression models can leverage representations from lower-compression\nmodels. Building on this insight, we develop a bootstrapped\nhigh-temporal-compression model that progressively trains high-compression\nblocks atop well-trained lower-compression models. Our method includes a\ncross-level feature-mixing module to retain information from the pretrained\nlow-compression model and guide higher-compression blocks to capture the\nremaining details from the full video sequence. Evaluation of video benchmarks\nshows that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality while\nincreasing temporal compression compared to directly training the full model.\nFurthermore, the resulting compact latent space effectively trains a video\ndiffusion model for high-quality video generation with a significantly reduced\ntoken budget.",

The inclusion\ncriteria targeted peer-reviewed papers published between 2020 and 2024. Papers\nwere screened for relevance to Neuro-Symbolic AI, with further inclusion based\non the availability of associated codebases to ensure reproducibility.\n  Results: From an initial pool of 1,428 papers, 167 met the inclusion criteria\nand were analyzed in detail.

In this paper, we\nstudy methods for constructing guardrails for AI agents that use reward\nfunctions to learn decision making. We introduce a novel approach, which we\ncall strategy masking, to explicitly learn and then suppress undesirable AI\nagent behavior.

Specifically, given $N$ independent random points\n$x_1,\\ldots,x_N$ in $\\mathbb{R}^D$ and a parameter $\\alpha \\in (0, 1)$ such\nthat each $x_i$ is drawn from a Gaussian with mean $\\mu$ and unknown\ncovariance, and an unknown $\\alpha$-fraction of the points have\nidentity-bounded covariances, the goal is to estimate the common mean $\\mu$.\nThe one-dimensional version of this task has received significant attention in\ntheoretical computer science and statistics over the past decades. Recent work\n[LY20; CV24] has given near-optimal upper and lower bounds for the\none-dimensional setting. On the other hand, our understanding of even the\ninformation-theoretic aspects of the multivariate setting has remained limited.\n  In this work, we design a computationally efficient algorithm achieving an\ninformation-theoretically near-optimal error. Specifically, we show that the\noptimal error (up to polylogarithmic factors) is $f(\\alpha,N) + \\sqrt{D/(\\alpha\nN)}$, where the term $f(\\alpha,N)$ is the error of the one-dimensional problem\nand the second term is the sub-Gaussian error rate. Our algorithmic approach\nemploys an iterative refinement strategy, whereby we progressively learn more\naccurate approximations $\\hat \\mu$ to $\\mu$. This is achieved via a novel\nrejection sampling procedure that removes points significantly deviating from\n$\\hat \\mu$, as an attempt to filter out unusually noisy samples. A complication\nthat arises is that rejection sampling introduces bias in the distribution of\nthe remaining points. To address this issue, we perform a careful analysis of\nthe bias, develop an iterative dimension-reduction strategy, and employ a novel\nsubroutine inspired by list-decodable learning that leverages the\none-dimensional result.",

To our knowledge, even the\nNewtonian part within this setup is novel. Building on this, we also include,\nup to second order in perturbation theory, the dynamical general relativistic\nand radiation effects, together with the leading relativistic projection\neffects. For simplicity, we neglect tracer bias and line-of-sight integrated\ncontributions, however note that in particular the former can be\nstraightforwardly incorporated within our framework. We evaluate the bispectrum\ncontributions for two redshift bins, $1.75 \\leq z \\leq 2.25$ and $0.55 \\leq z\n\\leq 0.65$, and compare our theoretical prediction against relativistic\nlight-cone simulations, with line-of-sight integral effects removed so as to\nenable direct consistency checks. As expected, we find that the Newtonian\ncontributions are typically one or more orders of magnitudes larger than the\nrelativistic signal across the entire spectrum for both redshifts. At $z=2$, we\nfind that projection and dynamical relativistic effects have comparable\namplitudes on large scales; somewhat unexpectedly, however, radiation effects\ndominate the relativistic signal in the squeezed limit. At $z=0.6$, the\nexpected hierarchy is recovered, though dynamical corrections remain\nnon-negligible -- only a factor of 2-3 smaller than projection effects.

Real-time\ntension feedback is crucial for precise articulation but remains a challenge in\ncompact actuation unit designs. Additionally, accurate shape and external force\nsensing of continuum instruments are essential for advanced control and\nmanipulation.

We introduce LongProc (Long Procedural Generation), a new\nbenchmark that requires both the integration of highly dispersed information\nand long-form generation. LongProc consists of six diverse procedural\ngeneration tasks, such as extracting structured information from HTML pages\ninto a TSV format and executing complex search procedures to create travel\nplans. These tasks challenge LCLMs by testing their ability to follow detailed\nprocedural instructions, synthesize and reason over dispersed information, and\ngenerate structured, long-form outputs (up to 8K tokens). Furthermore, as these\ntasks adhere to deterministic procedures and yield structured outputs, they\nenable reliable rule-based evaluation. We evaluated 23 LCLMs, including\ninstruction-tuned models and recent reasoning models, on LongProc at three\ndifficulty levels, with the maximum number of output tokens set at 500, 2K, and\n8K. Notably, while all tested models claim a context window size above 32K\ntokens, open-weight models typically falter on 2K-token tasks, and\nclosed-source models like GPT-4o show significant degradation on 8K-token\ntasks. Reasoning models achieve stronger overall performance in long-form\ngeneration, benefiting from long CoT training.

This results in programs with several nested loops and dynamic\ndata dependencies between tensors. While DL systems with eager execution\nsupport such dynamism, they lack the optimizations and smart scheduling of\ngraph-based execution. Graph-based execution, however, cannot express dynamic\ntensor shapes, instead requiring the use of multiple static subgraphs. Either\nexecution model for DRL thus leads to redundant computation, reduced\nparallelism, and less efficient memory management.\n  We describe TimeRL, a system for executing dynamic DRL programs that combines\nthe dynamism of eager execution with the whole-program optimizations and\nscheduling of graph-based execution. TimeRL achieves this by introducing the\ndeclarative programming model of recurrent tensors, which allows users to\ndefine dynamic dependencies as intuitive recurrence equations. TimeRL\ntranslates recurrent tensors into a polyhedral dependence graph (PDG) with\ndynamic dependencies as symbolic expressions. Through simple PDG\ntransformations, TimeRL applies whole-program optimizations, such as automatic\nvectorization, incrementalization, and operator fusion. The PDG also allows for\nthe computation of an efficient program-wide execution schedule, which decides\non buffer deallocations, buffer donations, and GPU/CPU memory swapping. We show\nthat TimeRL executes current DRL algorithms up to 47$\\times$ faster than\nexisting DRL systems, while using 16$\\times$ less GPU peak memory.",

These\nresults were then used to analyze two-level quantum systems as the working\nmedium of QTMs in the Otton cycle. In particular, we analyzed two specific\nquantum systems: the laser and a spinless electron in a one-dimensional quantum\nring, yielding consistent and innovative results. Overall, this study offers\nvaluable insights into the operation and classification of QTMs, establishing a\nclear and unified framework for their nomenclature while opening new avenues\nfor the design and enhancement of these devices.",

Tuning and controlling\nthe behavior of these circuits is inextricably linked to plasma performance.\nLinear models are greatly preferred for control applications due to their\nwell-established performance guarantees, but they typically fail to capture\nnonlinear dynamics and changes in experimental parameters. Data-driven system\nidentification can help mitigate these shortcomings by learning interpretable\nand accurate reduced-order models of a complex system, in this case the\ninjector circuits of the Helicity Injected Torus - Steady Inductive Upgrade\n(HIT-SIU) experiment. Specifically, the Bagging Optimized Dynamic Mode\nDecomposition (BOP-DMD), is leveraged to learn stable, reduced order models of\nthe interaction between the spheromak plasma formed in the confinement volume,\nand the injector circuits of the device. BOP-DMD is trained and evaluated on an\nanalytic model of the vacuum dynamics of the injector circuits of HIT-SIU, as\nwell as an analytic linear reduced-order model for the injector dynamics when a\nplasma is present. BOP-DMD is then fit on experimental data, both on shots with\nand without a plasma in the confinement volume. In doing so, we demonstrate the\ncapability of data-driven methods to produce stable, linear models for control\nand uncertainty quantification in plasma experiments.",

    "abstract": "In lattice field theory, field sparsening aims to replace quantum fields, or\nobjects constructed from them, with approximations that preserve the\nappropriate symmetries and maintain many aspects of the physics that the fields\ndetermine. For example, an effective sparsening of a quark propagator provides\nan efficient map from a quark propagator on a fine lattice geometry to a quark\npropagator defined on a coarser geometry in order to reduce storage and\ncomputational costs of subsequent calculational stages while maintaining\nlong-distance correlations and corresponding low-energy physical information.\nPrevious studies have focused on decimating lattice sites or randomly sampling\nlattice sites to reduce the size of the propagator and subsequent costs of Wick\ncontractions. Here, we extend the study of sparsening to incorporate covariant\naveraging of spatial sites and examine the effects on two-point and three-point\ncorrelation functions involving various hadrons. We find that sparsening is\nmost effective in reproducing the unsparsened versions of these correlation\nfunctions when weighted covariant-averaging is sequentially applied many times.",

The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is a key\nmechanism for angular momentum transport and large-scale magnetic field\namplification. Recent work has begun to address the regime of high magnetic\nPrandtl number $\\mathrm{Pm}$, the ratio of viscosity to resistivity, in which\nangular momentum and magnetic energy increase with $\\mathrm{Pm}$. This regime\nreveals unique dynamics of small-scale turbulence in disk mid-planes and\nbuoyancy instabilities in the atmosphere. This study aims to build on these\nfindings, focusing on the MRI-driven $\\alpha\\Omega$ dynamo in stratified\nsimulations to understand magnetic field generation in the high-$\\mathrm{Pm}$\nregime. We analyze data taken from stratified shearing box simulations both in\nthe regime of magnetic Prandtl number of order unity, and also in the high\n$\\mathrm{Pm}$ regime employing new techniques to compute the dynamo\ncoefficients. We find that the mean-magnetic field evolution can be described\nby an $\\alpha\\Omega$ dynamo, even in the high-Pm regime. The mean magnetic\nfield as well as the dynamo coefficients increase with Pm. This leads to a\nshorter dynamo period and a faster growth rate. We also find that the\noff-diagonal coefficients have an impact on the propagation of the magnetic\nfield in the dynamo region. Overall, the magnetic field amplification found in\nglobal simulations should be increased by at least a factor of $\\sim 5$, which\ncould lead to more powerful jets and stronger winds from astrophysical disks in\nthe high-Pm regime.",

Using both\nanalytical approach and numerical simulations, we have exactly explored the\ntransient and steady-state behavior of the particle by analyzing the simulated\nparticle trajectories, probability distribution functions for position and\nvelocity, mean square displacement, mean square velocity, and effective kinetic\ntemperature of the medium. From the mean square displacement calculations, we\nobserve that, unlike an inertial active Brownian particle, a chiral active\nparticle manifests an initial ballistic, intermediate sub-diffusive to\nnon-diffusive, and the conventional long-time diffusive behavior. The\nintermediate sub-diffusive to non-diffusive behavior is prominent for the\nself-propulsion of an overdamped particle. It can be understood by\nchirality-induced transient confinement, which persists for short time\nintervals and diffuses away in the time asymptotic limit or at the steady\nstate. This behavior is further complemented by the exact calculation of mean\nsquare velocity or effective kinetic temperature of the medium, which is a\ndecreasing function of the magnitude of chirality. Moreover, the steady-state\nMSD and MSV are found to have a dependence both on chirality and activity time\nscale and hence can be controlled by tuning the persistent duration of activity\nor strength of the chirality of the particle.",

For such problems, we introduce the dual\nmatrix-valued variational formulation in the spirit of [Y. Brenier. Comm. Math.\nPhys. (2018) 364(2) 579-605].

We also prove\nsolvability of the dual problem in the corresponding anisotropic Orlicz spaces.\nAs an application, we show that no subsolution of the PDEs that fit into our\nframework is able to dissipate the total entropy earlier or faster than the\nstrong solution on the interval of existence of the latter.

Our method combines and\nextends speed-up techniques used in previous scenario addition methods (also\ncalled column-and-constraint generation methods) and introduces several new\ntechniques. In particular, it uses dual bounds for second-stage problems in\norder to allow a faster identification of the next promising scenario to be\nadded to the master problem. Moreover, adaptive time limits are imposed to\navoid getting stuck on particularly hard second-stage problems, and a gap\npropagation between master problem and second-stage problems is used to stop\nsolving them earlier if only a given non-zero optimality gap is to be reached\noverall. This makes our method particularly effective for problems where\nsolving the second-stage problem is computationally challenging. To evaluate\nthe method's performance, we compare it to two recent scenario addition methods\nfrom the literature on two applications: a robust capacitated location routing\nproblem and a robust integrated berth allocation and quay crane assignment and\nscheduling problem. The first problem features a particularly hard second\nstage, and we show that our method is able to solve considerably more and\nlarger instances in a given time limit.

Resilient, deterministic protocols rely on the detection of\nmajorities to avoid inconsistencies if there is a Byzantine minority, which\nrequires individual nodes to handle a communication workload that is\nproportional to the size of the network -- an intolerable disadvantage in large\nnetworks. Randomized protocols circumvent this by probing only small parts of\nthe network, thus allowing for consistent decisions quickly and with a high\nlevel of confidence with communication that is near-constant in the network\nsize. However, such protocols usually come with the drawback of limiting the\nfault tolerance of the protocol, for instance, by severely restricting the\nnumber or type of failures that the protocol can tolerate. We present\nrandomized protocols to reliably aggregate and broadcast information, form\nconsensus and compute common coins that tolerate a constant fraction of\nByzantine failures, do not require cryptographic signatures and have a\nnear-constant time and message complexity per node. Our main technique is to\ncompute a system of witness committees as a pre-computation step almost\noptimally.

    "abstract": "This work studies linear bandits under a new notion of gap-adjusted\nmisspecification and is an extension of Liu et al. (2023). When the underlying\nreward function is not linear, existing linear bandits work usually relies on a\nuniform misspecification parameter $\\epsilon$ that measures the sup-norm error\nof the best linear approximation. This results in an unavoidable linear regret\nwhenever $\\epsilon > 0$. We propose a more natural model of misspecification\nwhich only requires the approximation error at each input $x$ to be\nproportional to the suboptimality gap at $x$. It captures the intuition that,\nfor optimization problems, near-optimal regions should matter more and we can\ntolerate larger approximation errors in suboptimal regions.\n  Quite surprisingly, we show that the classical LinUCB algorithm -- designed\nfor the realizable case -- is automatically robust against such\n$\\rho$-gap-adjusted misspecification with parameter $\\rho$ diminishing at\n$O(1/(d \\sqrt{\\log T}))$. It achieves a near-optimal $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret for\nproblems that the best-known regret is almost linear in time horizon $T$. We\nfurther advance this frontier by presenting a novel phased elimination-based\nalgorithm whose gap-adjusted misspecification parameter $\\rho = O(1/\\sqrt{d})$\ndoes not scale with $T$. This algorithm attains optimal $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret\nand is deployment-efficient, requiring only $\\log T$ batches of exploration. It\nalso enjoys an adaptive $O(\\log T)$ regret when a constant suboptimality gap\nexists. Technically, our proof relies on a novel self-bounding argument that\nbounds the part of the regret due to misspecification by the regret itself, and\na new inductive lemma that limits the misspecification error within the\nsuboptimality gap for all valid actions in each batch selected by G-optimal\ndesign.",

    "abstract": "Corrigibility of autonomous agents is an under explored part of system\ndesign, with previous work focusing on single agent systems. It has been\nsuggested that uncertainty over the human preferences acts to keep the agents\ncorrigible, even in the face of human irrationality. We present a general\nframework for modelling corrigibility in a multi-agent setting as a 2 player\ngame in which the agents always have a move in which they can ask the human for\nsupervision. This is formulated as a Bayesian game for the purpose of\nintroducing uncertainty over the human beliefs. We further analyse two specific\ncases. First, a two player corrigibility game, in which we want corrigibility\ndisplayed in both agents for both common payoff (monotone) games and harmonic\ngames. Then we investigate an adversary setting, in which one agent is\nconsidered to be a `defending' agent and the other an `adversary'. A general\nresult is provided for what belief over the games and human rationality the\ndefending agent is required to have to induce corrigibility.",

This raises concerns about the potential abuse of\nimage generation, such as the creation of explicit or violent images, commonly\nreferred to as Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content. To address this, the Stable\nDiffusion model includes several safety checkers to censor initial text prompts\nand final output images generated from the model. However, recent research has\nshown that these safety checkers have vulnerabilities against adversarial\nattacks, allowing them to generate NSFW images. In this paper, we find that\nthese adversarial attacks are not robust to small changes in text prompts or\ninput latents. Based on this, we propose SC-Pro (Spherical or Circular\nProbing), a training-free framework that easily defends against adversarial\nattacks generating NSFW images.

The remanent\npolarization increases with film thickness, reflecting enhanced domain\nstability, while endurance cycles highlight the wake-up effect and its eventual\ndegradation due to fatigue in thicker films. Similarly, coercive fields\ndecrease with thickness, indicating reduced switching barriers and a clearer\ntransition between tetragonal and orthorhombic phases.

A powerful framework for this purpose\nis the Quantum Model Learning Agent (QMLA) which characterizes a given system\nby learning its Hamiltonian via adaptive generations of informative experiments\nand their validation against simulated models. Identifying the incoherent noise\nof a quantum device in addition to its coherent interactions is, however, as\nessential. Precise knowledge of such imperfections of a quantum device allows\nto devise strategies to mitigate detrimental effects, for example via quantum\nerror correction. We introduce the open Quantum Model Learning Agent (oQMLA)\nframework to account for Markovian noise through the Liouvillian formalism. By\nsimultaneously learning the Hamiltonian and jump operators, oQMLA independently\ncaptures both the coherent and incoherent dynamics of a system.

    "abstract": "On the main sequence, the asteroseismic small frequency separation\n$\\delta\\nu_{02}$ between radial and quadrupole p-modes is customarily\ninterpreted to be a direct diagnostic of internal structure. Such an\ninterpretation is based on a well-known integral estimator relating\n$\\delta\\nu_{02}$ to a radially-averaged sound-speed gradient. However, this\nestimator fails, catastrophically, when evaluated on structural models of red\ngiants: their small separations must therefore be interpreted differently. We\nderive a single expression which both reduces to the classical estimator when\napplied to main-sequence stellar models, yet reproduces the qualitative\nfeatures of the small separation for stellar models of very evolved red giants.\nThis expression indicates that the small separations of red giants scale\nprimarily with their global seismic properties as $\\delta\\nu_{02} \\propto\n\\Delta\\nu^2/\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$, rather than being in any way sensitive to their\ninternal structure. Departures from this asymptotic behaviour, during the\ntransition from the main-sequence to red giant regimes, have been recently\nreported in open-cluster Christensen-Dalsgaard (C-D) diagrams from K2 mission\ndata. Investigating them in detail, we demonstrate that they occur when the\nconvective envelope boundary passes a specific acoustic distance -- roughly a\nthird of a wavelength at $\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$ -- from the centre of the star, at\nwhich point radial modes become maximally sensitive to the position of the\nboundary. The shape of the corresponding features on $\\epsilon_p$ and C-D (or\n$r_{02}$) diagrams may be useful in constraining the nature of convective\nboundary mixing, in the context of undershooting beneath a convective envelope.",

However,\neffectively automating the design process across the vast search space of those\nthree dimensions poses significant challenges, especially when pursuing\nextremely low-bit quantization. Specifical, the primary challenges include: (1)\nMemory overhead in software-side: Low-precision quantization-aware training can\nlead to significant memory usage due to storing large intermediate features and\nlatent weights for back-propagation, potentially causing memory exhaustion. (2)\nSearch time-consuming in hardware-side: The discrete nature of hardware\nparameters and the complex interplay between compiler optimizations and\nindividual operators make the accelerator search time-consuming. To address\nthese issues, JAQ mitigates the memory overhead through a channel-wise sparse\nquantization (CSQ) scheme, selectively applying quantization to the most\nsensitive components of the model during optimization. Additionally, JAQ\ndesigns BatchTile, which employs a hardware generation network to encode all\npossible tiling modes, thereby speeding up the search for the optimal compiler\nmapping strategy.

    "abstract": "Prototype-based federated learning has emerged as a promising approach that\nshares lightweight prototypes to transfer knowledge among clients with data\nheterogeneity in a model-agnostic manner. However, existing methods often\ncollect prototypes directly from local models, which inevitably introduce\ninconsistencies into representation learning due to the biased data\ndistributions and differing model architectures among clients. In this paper,\nwe identify that both statistical and model heterogeneity create a vicious\ncycle of representation inconsistency, classifier divergence, and skewed\nprototype alignment, which negatively impacts the performance of clients. To\nbreak the vicious cycle, we propose a novel framework named Federated Learning\nvia Semantic Anchors (FedSA) to decouple the generation of prototypes from\nlocal representation learning. We introduce a novel perspective that uses\nsimple yet effective semantic anchors serving as prototypes to guide local\nmodels in learning consistent representations. By incorporating semantic\nanchors, we further propose anchor-based regularization with margin-enhanced\ncontrastive learning and anchor-based classifier calibration to correct feature\nextractors and calibrate classifiers across clients, achieving intra-class\ncompactness and inter-class separability of prototypes while ensuring\nconsistent decision boundaries. We then update the semantic anchors with these\nconsistent and discriminative prototypes, which iteratively encourage clients\nto collaboratively learn a unified data representation with robust\ngeneralization. Extensive experiments under both statistical and model\nheterogeneity settings show that FedSA significantly outperforms existing\nprototype-based FL methods on various classification tasks.",

In our generalized setting, each\nmiller can freely choose any location for setting up a mill, while each baker\nis restricted in the choice of location for setting up a bakery. For optimal\nbargaining power, a baker would like to select a location with many millers to\nbuy flour from and with little competition from other bakers. Likewise, a\nmiller aims for a location with many bakers and few competing millers. Thus,\nboth types of agents choose locations to optimize the ratio of agents of\nopposite type divided by agents of the same type at their chosen location.\nOriginally raised in the context of Fractional Hedonic Games, the Bakers and\nMillers Game has applications that range from commerce to product design.\n  We study the impact of location restrictions on the properties of the game.\nWhile pure Nash equilibria trivially exist in the setting without location\nrestrictions, we show via a sophisticated, efficient algorithm that even the\nmore challenging restricted setting admits equilibria. Moreover, the computed\nequilibrium approximates the optimal social welfare by a factor of at most\n$2\\left(\\frac{e}{e-1}\\right)$. Furthermore, we give tight bounds on the price\nof anarchy/stability.\n  On the conceptual side, the location choice feature adds a new layer to the\nstandard setting of Hedonic Games, in the sense that agents that select the\nsame location form a coalition. This allows to naturally restrict the possible\ncoalitions that can be formed. With this, our model generalizes simple\nsymmetric Fractional Hedonic Games on complete bipartite valuation graphs and\nalso Hedonic Diversity Games with utilities single-peaked at 0. We believe that\nthis generalization is also a very interesting direction for other types of\nHedonic Games.",

In this paper, we characterize the classes that are\nlearnable under their proposed relaxed conditions, resolving the two open\nproblems raised in their work.\n  First, we prove that in the setting where the stability parameter can depend\non the excess error (the gap between the learner's error and the best\nachievable error by the hypothesis class), agnostic stability is fully\ncharacterized by the Littlestone dimension. Consequently, as in the realizable\ncase, this form of learnability is equivalent to online learnability.\n  As part of the proof of this theorem, we strengthen the celebrated result of\nBun et al. by showing that classes with infinite Littlestone dimension are not\nstably PAC learnable, even if we allow the stability parameter to depend on the\nexcess error.\n  For the second relaxation proposed by Chase et al., we prove that only finite\nhypothesis classes are globally stable learnable, even if we restrict the\nagnostic setting to distributions with small population loss.",

The method results from the combination of the force partitioning method\n(Menon and Mittal, J. Fluid Mech., 907:A37, 2021) and modal decomposition\ntechniques such as Reynolds decomposition, triple decomposition, and proper\northogonal decomposition, and is applied here to three distinct flows -\ntwo-dimensional flows past a circular cylinder and an airfoil, and the\nthree-dimensional flow over a revolving rectangular wing. We show that the\nforce partitioning method applied to modal decomposition of velocity fields\nresults in complex, and difficult to interpret inter-modal interactions. We\ntherefore propose and apply modal decomposition directly to the $Q$-field\nassociated with these flows. The variable $Q$ is a non-linear observable that\nis typically used to identify vortices in a flow, and we find that the direct\ndecomposition of $Q$ leads to results that are more amenable to interpretation.\nWe also demonstrate that this modal force partitioning can be extended to\nprovide insights into the far-field aeroacoustic loading noise of these flows.",

However,\nquantifying superlubricity across the vast four-dimensional heterodeformation\nspace using experiments or atomic-scale simulations is a challenging task. In\nthis work, we develop an atomically informed dynamic Frenkel--Kontorova (DFK)\nmodel for predicting the interface friction drag coefficient of an arbitrarily\nheterodeformed bilayer graphene (BG) system. The model is motivated by MD\nsimulations of friction in heterodeformed BG. In particular, we note that\ninterface dislocations formed during structural relaxation translate in unison\nwhen a heterodeformed BG is subjected to shear traction, leading us to the\nhypothesis that the kinetic properties of interface dislocations determine the\nfriction drag coefficient of the interface. The constitutive law of the DFK\nmodel comprises the generalized stacking fault energy of the AB stacking, a\nscalar displacement drag coefficient, and the elastic properties of graphene,\nwhich are all obtained from atomistic simulations. Simulations of the DFK model\nconfirm our hypothesis since a single choice of the displacement drag\ncoefficient, fit to the kinetic property of an individual dislocation in an\natomistic simulation, predicts interface friction in any heterodeformed BG. By\nbridging the gap between dislocation kinetics at the microscale to interface\nfriction at the macroscale, the DFK model enables a high-throughput\ninvestigation of strain-engineered vdW heterostructures.",

Our system integrates the\npost-processing for QKD and QOT, both sharing a single physical layer, ensuring\nefficient key generation and authentication. Authentication involves hashing\nmessages into a crypto-context, verifying tags, and replenishing keys through a\nparallel QKD pipeline, which handles both key post-processing and\nauthentication.

The\ntopology of vortices in these systems has yet to be explored. In this work, we\ninvestigate the vortex bound states in superconducting Dirac semimetals, with a\nparticular focus on the orbital-singlet unconventional pairing, which generates\nhigher-order Majorana hinge modes. Remarkably, we identify robust double\nMajorana vortex flat bands at zero energy. In type-I Dirac semimetals, these\nMajorana flat bands are located between the projections of two superconduting\nDirac points. In contrast, in type-II Dirac semimetals, they extend across the\nentire 1D Brillouin zone. These double flat bands arise from a nontrivial\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology defined by an effective particle-hole symmetry and are\nprotected by the four-fold rotational symmetry. Additionally, we observe that\nmoving the vortex line close to a hinge can trivialize the higher-order\nMajorana arc on the hinge, leaving a single Majorana mode at the vortex core\ndue to the hybridization of Majorana modes.

    "abstract": "The architecture and composition of planetary systems are thought to be\nstrongly influenced by the transport and delivery of dust and volatiles via\nices on pebbles during the planet formation phase in protoplanetary discs.\nUnderstanding these transport mechanisms is crucial in building a comprehensive\npicture of planet formation, including material and chemical budget;\nconstraining the birth properties of these discs is a key step in this process.\nWe present a novel method of retrieving such properties by studying the\ntransport of icy pebbles in the context of an observed gas-phase CO enhancement\nwithin the CO snowline in the protoplanetary disc around HD 163296. We combine\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with a fast model of radial drift to\ndetermine the birth gas mass and characteristic radius of the disc, and compare\nour results against observations and models in the literature; we find the\nbirth-condition disc gas mass to be\n$\\log_{10}(M_{\\rm{disc}}/M_{\\odot})=-0.64^{+0.19}_{-0.24}$ and the\ncharacteristic radius to be\n$\\log_{10}(r_{\\rm{c}}/\\rm{AU})=2.30^{+0.45}_{-0.46}$. We additionally determine\nthat dust grains must be `fragile' ($v_{f}=100~\\mathrm{cms}^{-1}$) to retain\nenough dust to match current dust mass observations, with our lowest\nfragmentation velocity model providing a current-age dust mass of\n$\\rm{M_{dust}}=662^{+518}_{-278} \\rm{M_{\\oplus}}$ based on the retrieved birth\nconditions. Using our retrieved birth conditions, we extend our simulations to\nmass of material reaching the water snowline in the inner disc, where\nterrestrial and super-Earth planets may be forming, and speculate on the nature\nof these exoplanets.",

Building on the\nseminal works of Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009) and Tachhella et al. (2012), which\nintroduced the economic complexity/fitness index, Sciarra et al.

In this paper, we apply\nthe SDGs-GENEPY, to evaluate the progress and evolution of Indian states and\nunion territories over several years. This enables us to identify each state's\ncapacity (and rank) in achieving the SDGs. We can interpret these complexity\nscores as \"centrality measures\" of a complex bipartite network of the states\nand the goals.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models\nhave been a dominant type of model architectures to enable large models\nnowadays, with parallel expert networks. Serving large MoE models on serverless\ncomputing is potentially beneficial, but has been underexplored due to\nsubstantial challenges in handling the skewed expert popularity and\nscatter-gather communication bottleneck in MoE model execution, for\ncost-efficient serverless MoE deployment and performance guarantee. We study\noptimized MoE model deployment and distributed inference serving on a\nserverless platform, that effectively predict expert selection, pipeline\ncommunication with model execution, and minimize the overall billed cost of\nserving MoE models. Especially, we propose a Bayesian optimization framework\nwith multi-dimensional epsilon-greedy search to learn expert selections and\noptimal MoE deployment achieving optimal billed cost, including: 1) a Bayesian\ndecision-making method for predicting expert popularity; 2) flexibly pipelined\nscatter-gather communication; and 3) an optimal model deployment algorithm for\ndistributed MoE serving. Extensive experiments on AWS Lambda show that our\ndesigns reduce the billed cost of all MoE layers by at least 75.67% compared to\nCPU clusters while maintaining satisfactory inference throughput. As compared\nto LambdaML in serverless computing, our designs achieves 43.41% lower cost\nwith a throughput decrease of at most 18.76%.",

This problem arises naturally in a variety of contexts including model\nselection, hypothesis testing, and within many DP algorithms. Classical\nmethods, such as Report Noisy Max (RNM), assume all candidates' scores are\nequally sensitive to changes in a single individual's data, but this often\nisn't the case. To address this, algorithms like the Generalised Exponential\nMechanism (GEM) leverage variability in candidate sensitivities. However, we\nobserve that while these algorithms can outperform RNM in some situations, they\nmay underperform in others - they can even perform worse than random selection.\nIn this work, we explore how the distribution of scores and sensitivities\nimpacts DP selection mechanisms. In all settings we study, we find that there\nexists a mechanism that utilises heterogeneity in the candidate sensitivities\nthat outperforms standard mechanisms like RNM. However, no single mechanism\nuniformly outperforms RNM. We propose using the correlation between the scores\nand sensitivities as the basis for deciding which DP selection mechanism to\nuse. Further, we design a slight variant of GEM, modified GEM that generally\nperforms well whenever GEM performs poorly.

    "abstract": "The estimation of a precision matrix is a crucial problem in various research\nfields, particularly when working with high dimensional data. In such settings,\nthe most common approach is to use the penalized maximum likelihood. The\nliterature typically employs Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net norms, which\neffectively shrink the entries of the estimated precision matrix. Although\nthese shrinkage approaches provide well-conditioned precision matrix estimates,\nthey do not explicitly address the uncertainty associated with these estimated\nmatrices. In fact, as the matrix becomes sparser, the precision matrix imposes\nfewer restrictions, leading to greater variability in the distribution, and\nthus, to higher entropy.

The objective of the proposed technique is to impose sparsity on\nthe precision matrix estimate and adjust the uncertainty through the\nlog-determinant term.

However, the microscopic\ntransient processes remain unclear, motivating this paper. Using 2D fluid\nmodels, we investigate SF6 streamer breakdown induced by a floating linear\nmetal particle under negative applied voltage. First, We identify a\ncharacteristic double-end streamer inception in the combined gap. Then, we\npropose the following streamer (FS) mechanism to explain the metal particle's\nrole. Two following streamers, FS1 and FS2, arise from the interaction between\nspace charge and metal particle. FS1 facilitates breakdown via the negative\nspace charge field generated by its head. FS2 facilitates breakdown by merging\nwith FS1, accelerating its propagation and enhancing the electric field at the\nprimary streamer head. Finally, we propose the side streamer (SS) mechanism to\nexplain the nonlinear breakdown behavior of high-pressure SF6. The SS is\nidentified as a new forward ionization wave that develops along the sides of\nthe primary streamer, due to photoionization-driven negative ion accumulation.\nSS facilitates breakdown by merging with the primary streamer, increasing\nnegative space charge and leading to three distinct propagation modes. Higher\npressure increases the production rate of negative ions along the streamer\nsides, making SS more likely to form. Under overvoltage, the facilitating\neffect of SS diminishes as the background field (E/N)b strengthens,\ndisappearing when (E/N)b exceeds 245 Td.

With a 2-day cadence, MOST achieves a\ntime delay error of only a few hours, with the bias typically remaining below\none hour. This study highlights the capability of MOST to significantly advance\nthe precision of time delay measurements, offering a promising path toward\nresolving the Hubble tension.",

    "abstract": "We develop signal capture and analysis techniques for precisely extracting\nand characterizing the frame timing of the Starlink constellation's Ku-band\ndownlink transmissions. The aim of this work is to determine whether Starlink\nframe timing has sufficient short-term stability to support pseudorange-based\nopportunistic positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT). A second goal is to\ndetermine whether frame timing is disciplined to a common time scale such as\nGPS time. Our analysis reveals several timing characteristics not previously\nknown that carry strong implications for PNT. On the favorable side, periods of\nns-level jitter in frame arrival times across all satellite versions indicate\nthat Starlink hardware is fundamentally capable of the short-term stability\nrequired to support GPS-like PNT. But there are several unfavorable\ncharacteristics that, if not addressed, will make GPS-like PNT impractical: (1)\nThe v1.0 and v1.5 Starlink satellites exhibit once-per-second abrupt frame\ntiming adjustments whose magnitude (as large as 100s of ns) and sign appear\nunpredictable. Similar discontinuities are also present in the v2.0-Mini frame\ntiming, though smaller and irregularly spaced. (2) Episodic 15-s periods of\nhigh frame jitter routinely punctuate the nominal low-jitter frame arrival\ntiming. (3) Starlink frame timing is disciplined to GPS time, but only loosely:\nto within a few ms by adjustments occurring every 15 s; otherwise exhibiting\ndrift that can exceed 20 ppm. These unfavorable characteristics are essentially\nincompatible with accurate PNT. Fortunately, they appear to be a consequence of\nsoftware design choices, not hardware limitations. Moreover, they could be\ncompensated with third-party-provided corrections.",

In this work,\nwe investigate vertical shear instabilities in these regions. The full Coriolis\nacceleration with the complete rotation vector at a general latitude is taken\ninto account. We formulate the problem by considering a canonical shear flow\nwith a hyperbolic-tangent profile. We perform linear stability analysis on this\nbase flow using both numerical and asymptotic\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) methods. Two types of instabilities\nare identified and explored: inflectional instability, which occurs in the\npresence of an inflection point in shear flow, and inertial instability due to\nan imbalance between the centrifugal acceleration and pressure gradient. Both\ninstabilities are promoted as thermal diffusion becomes stronger or\nstratification becomes weaker. Effects of the full Coriolis acceleration are\nfound to be more complex according to parametric investigations in wide ranges\nof colatitudes and rotation-to-shear and rotation-to-stratification ratios.\nAlso, new prescriptions for the vertical eddy viscosity are derived to model\nthe turbulent transport triggered by each instability.

The\nvisual complexity of web pages is known to influence search behavior, with\nprevious work suggesting that searchers make evaluative judgments within the\nfirst second on a page. However, there is a significant gap in our\nunderstanding of how visual complexity impacts searches specifically conducted\nwith a learning intent. This gap is particularly relevant for the development\nof optimized information retrieval (IR) systems that effectively support\neducational objectives. To address this research need, we model visual\ncomplexity and aesthetics via a diverse set of features, investigating their\nrelationship with search behavior during learning-oriented web sessions. Our\nstudy utilizes a publicly available dataset from a lab study where participants\nlearned about thunderstorm formation. Our findings reveal that while content\nrelevance is the most significant predictor for knowledge gain, sessions with\nless visually complex pages are associated with higher learning success. This\nobservation applies to features associated with the layout of web pages rather\nthan to simpler features (e.g., number of images). The reported results shed\nlight on the impact of visual complexity on learning-oriented searches,\ninforming the design of more effective IR systems for educational contexts.

Here we show that POT allows for the comprehensive\nexperimental identification of all molecular orbitals in a substantial binding\nenergy range, in the present case more than 10 eV. Making use of the angular\ndistribution of photoelectrons as a function of binding energy, we exemplify\nthis by extracting orbital-resolved partial densities of states (pDOS) for 15\n$\\pi$ and 23 $\\sigma$ orbitals from the experimental photoemission intensities\nof the prototypical organic molecule bisanthene (C$_{28}$H$_{14}$) on a Cu(110)\nsurface. In their entirety, these experimentally measured orbital-resolved pDOS\nfor an essentially complete set of orbitals serve as a stringent benchmark for\nelectronic structure methods, which we illustrate by performing density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations employing four frequently-used\nexchange-correlation functionals. By computing the respective\nmolecular-orbital-projected densities of states of the bisanthene/Cu(110)\ninterface, a one-to-one comparison with experimental data for an unprecedented\nnumber of 38 orbital energies becomes possible. The quantitative analysis of\nour data reveals that the range-separated hybrid functional HSE performs best\nfor the investigated organic/metal interface. At a more fundamental level, the\nremarkable agreement between the experimental and the Kohn-Sham orbital\nenergies over a binding energy range larger than 10\\,eV suggests that --\nperhaps unexpectedly -- Kohn-Sham orbitals approximate Dyson orbitals, which\nwould rigorously account for the electron extraction process in photoemission\nspectroscopy but are notoriously difficult to compute, in a much better way\nthan previously thought.",

A powerful\ntool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced\nin the late 1980's. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence\nbased methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments.\nAfter a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the\nrecurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the\nquantification of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantification\nanalysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the\ndynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences\nto dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence\nsuggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system's\nbehaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to\ncoupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction.\nThis fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of\nsynchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several\napplications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth\nsciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to\nprovide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot\nbased methods in their own field of research.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for\nsuborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization.\nInitially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine,\nthrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design\npurposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles\nattitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the\naltitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal\n(downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the\nnon-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov\nstability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the\ninner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output\ntracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference\ntracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The\nzero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the\nouterloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral\naction, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In\nthe outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty\nis indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known\naerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is\nproven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a\nsingle-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference\nvehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to\nverify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to\ntrack the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances.\nFurthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission\nscenarios is minimal to none.",

To improve our\nunderstanding of the non-thermal processes occurring in the pulsar wind nebula,\nwe attempted to determine the possible existence of a radio counterpart, study\nits morphology, and obtain restrictive upper limits of the pulsar and filament\nemission at radio wavelengths. We performed observations of the pulsar PSR\nJ2030+4415 and its surroundings with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope (uGMRT) at two frequency bands, and put the results in context with\nfindings at other wavelengths. We obtained radio images at 736 and 1274 MHz\nthat reveal a structure trailing the pulsar, with a morphology overlapping the\nX-ray nebula. This radio structure is the radio counterpart of the X-ray pulsar\nwind nebula. The derived spectral index along this structure shows spatial\nvariation. There are no hints of the pulsar and the filament at any of the\nexplored radio frequencies, but we obtained restrictive upper limits. A\nphysical scenario that combines the radio and the X-ray observations, and\nconsistent with IR data, of the nebula and the filament is presented. We\npropose that particle acceleration occurs in the nebula tail due to the\npresence of a re-collimation shock, and the highest energy particles gradually\nescape from it through energy-dependent diffusion.

    "abstract": "We introduce a model of simple type theory with potential infinite carrier\nsets. The functions in this model are automatically continuous, as defined in\nthis paper. This notion of continuity does not rely on topological concepts,\nincluding domain theoretic concepts, which essentially use actual infinite\nsets. The model is based on the concept of a factor system, which generalizes\ndirect and inverse systems. A factor system is basically an extensible set\nindexed over a directed set of stages, together with a predecessor relation\nbetween object states at different stages.\n  The function space, when considered as a factor system, expands\nsimultaneously with its elements. On the one hand, the space is subdivided more\nand more, on the other hand, the elements increase and are defined more and\nmore precisely. In addition, a factor system allows the construction of limits\nthat are part of its expansion process and not outside of it. At these limits,\nelements are indefinitely large or small, which is a contextual notion and a\nsubstitute for elements that are infinitely large or small (points). This\ndynamic and contextual view is consistent with an understanding of infinity as\na potential infinite.",

    "abstract": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify a mix of known and\nnovel categories within unlabeled data sets, providing a more realistic setting\nfor image recognition. Essentially, GCD needs to remember existing patterns\nthoroughly to recognize novel categories. Recent state-of-the-art method SimGCD\ntransfers the knowledge from known-class data to the learning of novel classes\nthrough debiased learning. However, some patterns are catastrophically forgot\nduring adaptation and thus lead to poor performance in novel categories\nclassification. To address this issue, we propose a novel learning approach,\nLegoGCD, which is seamlessly integrated into previous methods to enhance the\ndiscrimination of novel classes while maintaining performance on previously\nencountered known classes. Specifically, we design two types of techniques\ntermed as Local Entropy Regularization (LER) and Dual-views Kullback Leibler\ndivergence constraint (DKL). The LER optimizes the distribution of potential\nknown class samples in unlabeled data, thus ensuring the preservation of\nknowledge related to known categories while learning novel classes. Meanwhile,\nDKL introduces Kullback Leibler divergence to encourage the model to produce a\nsimilar prediction distribution of two view samples from the same image. In\nthis way, it successfully avoids mismatched prediction and generates more\nreliable potential known class samples simultaneously. Extensive experiments\nvalidate that the proposed LegoGCD effectively addresses the known category\nforgetting issue across all datasets, eg, delivering a 7.74% and 2.51% accuracy\nboost on known and novel classes in CUB, respectively.

This performance enables support for 1\nmillion token transfers per second (TPS), marking QMDB as the first solution\nachieving such a milestone. QMDB has been benchmarked with workloads exceeding\n15 billion entries (10X Ethereum's 2024 state) and has proven the capacity to\nscale to 280 billion entries on a single server. Furthermore, QMDB introduces\nhistorical proofs, unlocking the ability to query its blockchain's historical\nstate at the latest block.

Despite extensive theoretical\nwork, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with\nconflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured\nthe pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified\nmodels. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close\ncompetition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as\nwell as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a\nmulti-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We\nanalyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random\nphase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing\ns-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters,\nwhich is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These\nspin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a\nsuperconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model\nparameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the\nabsence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration\nand superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate\nspin-fluctuations.",

However,\nattackers may steal those valuable RAGs and deploy or commercialize them,\nmaking it essential to detect Intellectual Property (IP) infringement. Most\nexisting ownership protection solutions, such as watermarks, are designed for\nrelational databases and texts. They cannot be directly applied to RAGs because\nrelational database watermarks require white-box access to detect IP\ninfringement, which is unrealistic for the knowledge base in RAGs. Meanwhile,\npost-processing by the adversary's deployed LLMs typically destructs text\nwatermark information. To address those problems, we propose a novel black-box\n\"knowledge watermark\" approach, named RAG-WM, to detect IP infringement of\nRAGs. RAG-WM uses a multi-LLM interaction framework, comprising a Watermark\nGenerator, Shadow LLM & RAG, and Watermark Discriminator, to create watermark\ntexts based on watermark entity-relationship tuples and inject them into the\ntarget RAG. We evaluate RAG-WM across three domain-specific and two\nprivacy-sensitive tasks on four benchmark LLMs. Experimental results show that\nRAG-WM effectively detects the stolen RAGs in various deployed LLMs.\nFurthermore, RAG-WM is robust against paraphrasing, unrelated content removal,\nknowledge insertion, and knowledge expansion attacks.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their exceptional performance\nin various complex code generation tasks. However, their broader adoption is\nlimited by significant computational demands and high resource requirements,\nparticularly memory and processing power. To mitigate such requirements, model\npruning techniques are used to create more compact models with significantly\nfewer parameters. However, current approaches do not focus on the efficient\nextraction of programming-language-specific sub-models. In this work, we\nexplore the idea of efficiently deriving coding-specific sub-models through\nunstructured pruning (i.e., Wanda). We investigate the impact of different\ndomain-specific calibration datasets on pruning outcomes across three distinct\ndomains and extend our analysis to extracting four language-specific\nsub-models: Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. We are the first to efficiently\nextract programming-language-specific sub-models using appropriate calibration\ndatasets while maintaining acceptable accuracy w.r.t. full models. We are also\nthe first to provide analytical evidence that domain-specific tasks activate\ndistinct regions within LLMs, supporting the creation of specialized sub-models\nthrough unstructured pruning. We believe that this work has significant\npotential to enhance LLM accessibility for coding by reducing computational\nrequirements to enable local execution on consumer-grade hardware, and\nsupporting faster inference times critical for real-time development feedback.",

This level of performance is not, however,\nuniversal across all tasks, all LLMs and all prompting styles. There are many\nareas where one LLM dominates, one prompting style dominates, or where calling\na symbolic solver is a better choice than an LLM. A key challenge for the user\nthen, is to identify not only when an LLM is the right choice of solver, and\nthe appropriate LLM to call for a given synthesis task, but also the right way\nto call it. A non-expert user who makes the wrong choice, incurs a cost both in\nterms of results (number of tasks solved, and the time it takes to solve them)\nand financial cost, if using a closed-source language model via a commercial\nAPI. We frame this choice as an online learning problem. We use a multi-armed\nbandit algorithm to select which symbolic solver, or LLM and prompt combination\nto deploy in order to maximize a given reward function (which may prioritize\nsolving time, number of synthesis tasks solved, or financial cost of solving).\nWe implement an instance of this approach, called CYANEA, and evaluate it on\nsynthesis queries from the literature in ranking function synthesis, from the\nsyntax-guided synthesis competition, and fresh, unseen queries generated from\nSMT problems.

However, the geometry of\nNLOS imaging inherently results in non-uniform sampling on the relay surface\nwhen using multi-pixel detector arrays, even though such arrays significantly\nreduce acquisition times. Furthermore, using these arrays increases the data\nrate required for sensor readout, posing challenges for real-world deployment.\nIn this work, we utilize the phasor field framework to demonstrate that\nexisting NLOS imaging setups typically oversample the relay surface spatially,\nexplaining why the measurement can be compressed without significantly\nsacrificing reconstruction quality. This enables us to utilize the Non-Uniform\nFast Fourier Transform (NUFFT) to reconstruct from sparse measurements acquired\nfrom irregularly sampled relay surfaces of arbitrary shapes.

    "abstract": "Optical computing offers potential for ultra high-speed and low latency\ncomputation by leveraging the intrinsic properties of light. Here, we explore\nthe use of highly nonlinear optical fibers (HNLFs) as platforms for optical\ncomputing based on the concept of Extreme Learning Machines. Task-independent\nevaluations are introduced to the field for the first time and focus on the\nfundamental metrics of effective dimensionality and consistency, which we\nexperimentally characterize for different nonlinear and dispersive conditions.\nWe show that input power and fiber characteristics significantly influence the\ndimensionality of the computational system, with longer fibers and higher\ndispersion producing up to 100 principal components (PCs) at input power levels\nof 30 mW, where the PC correspond to the linearly independent dimensions of the\nsystem. The spectral distribution of the PC's eigenvectors reveals that the\nhigh-dimensional dynamics facilitating computing through dimensionality\nexpansion are located within 40~nm of the pump wavelength at 1560~nm, providing\ngeneral insight for computing with nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation systems.\nTask-dependent results demonstrate the effectiveness of HNLFs in classifying\nMNIST dataset images. Using input data compression through PC analysis, we\ninject MNIST images of various input dimensionality into the system and study\nthe impact of input power upon classification accuracy. At optimized power\nlevels we achieve a classification test accuracy of 88\\%, significantly\nsurpassing the baseline of 83.7\\% from linear systems. Noteworthy, we find that\nbest performance is not obtained at maximal input power, i.e. maximal system\ndimensionality, but at more than one order of magnitude lower. The same is\nconfirmed regarding the MNIST image's compression, where accuracy is\nsubstantially improved when strongly compressing the image to less than 50 PCs.",

However, the full transformative\npotential of molecular intercalation remains underexplored, largely due to the\nlack of simple, broadly applicable methods that preserve high crystalline\nquality down to the few-layer limit. Here, we introduce a simple galvanic\napproach to intercalate different molecules into various vdW materials under\nambient conditions, leveraging the low reduction potential of selected metals\nto enable a spontaneous molecular insertion.

Notably, intercalation leads to\na molecule-dependent enhancement of the superconducting transition in 2H-TaS2,\nreaching a critical temperature of 4.7 K, higher than TaS2 monolayers.\nAdditionally, RuCl3 exhibits an unprecedented transition from antiferromagnetic\nto ferrimagnetic ordering upon intercalation with cobaltocenium.

To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel strategy to enhance zero-shot OOD detection performances for both Far-OOD\nand Near-OOD scenarios by innovatively harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs)\nand VLMs. Our approach first exploit an LLM to generate superclasses of the ID\nlabels and their corresponding background descriptions followed by feature\nextraction using CLIP.

The refined\nrepresentation facilitates the selection of more appropriate negative labels\nfor OOD data from a comprehensive candidate label set of WordNet, thereby\nenhancing the performance of zero-shot OOD detection in both scenarios.\nFurthermore, we introduce novel few-shot prompt tuning and visual prompt tuning\nto adapt the proposed framework to better align with the target distribution.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently\noutperforms current state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, with\nan improvement of up to 2.9% in AUROC and a reduction of up to 12.6% in FPR95.\nAdditionally, our method exhibits superior robustness against covariate shift\nacross different domains, further highlighting its effectiveness in real-world\nscenarios.",

The\nlinear RUM-NN retains the interpretability and identifiability of traditional\neconometric discrete choice models while using neural network-based estimation\ntechniques. The nonlinear RUM-NN extends the model's flexibility and predictive\ncapabilities to capture nonlinear relationships between variables within\nutility functions.

Additionally, RUM-NN is\nevaluated on the Swissmetro and the London Passenger Mode Choice (LPMC)\ndatasets with different sets of distribution assumptions for the error\ncomponent.

While feasible for pseudo-Boolean\noptimization problems, this method may fail to guarantee approximate\nperformance for one party in NP-hard problems. Finally, We propose\ncoevolutionary multi-party multi-objective optimizers (CoEMPMO) for\npseudo-Boolean optimization and shortest path problems within a multi-party\nmulti-objective context, which maintains a common solution set among all\nparties through coevolution. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed \\( \\text{CoEMPMO}_{\\text{random}} \\) outperforms previous\nalgorithms in terms of the expected lower bound on runtime for pseudo-Boolean\noptimization problems. Additionally, \\(\n\\text{CoEMPMO}_{\\text{cons}}^{\\text{SP}} \\) achieves better efficiency and\nprecision in solving shortest path problems compared to existing algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely used to visualize neural\nnetwork decisions, yet their underlying mechanisms remain incompletely\nunderstood. To enhance the understanding of CAM methods and improve their\nexplainability, we introduce the Content Reserved Game-theoretic (CRG)\nExplainer. This theoretical framework clarifies the theoretical foundations of\nGradCAM and HiResCAM by modeling the neural network prediction process as a\ncooperative game. Within this framework, we develop ShapleyCAM, a new method\nthat leverages gradients and the Hessian matrix to provide more precise and\ntheoretically grounded visual explanations. Due to the computational\ninfeasibility of exact Shapley value calculation, ShapleyCAM employs a\nsecond-order Taylor expansion of the cooperative game's utility function to\nderive a closed-form expression. Additionally, we propose the Residual Softmax\nTarget-Class (ReST) utility function to address the limitations of pre-softmax\nand post-softmax scores. Extensive experiments across 12 popular networks on\nthe ImageNet validation set demonstrate the effectiveness of ShapleyCAM and its\nvariants. Our findings not only advance CAM explainability but also bridge the\ngap between heuristic-driven CAM methods and compute-intensive Shapley\nvalue-based methods.

    "abstract": "Proximity ferroelectricity has recently been reported as a new design\nparadigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar\nmaterial becomes a ferroelectric by interfacing with a thin ferroelectric\nlayer. Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO, which were previously\nunswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown fields,\ncan now be switched with practical coercive fields when they are in intimate\nproximity to a switchable ferroelectric. Here, we develop a general\nLandau-Ginzburg theory of proximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of\nnon-ferroelectrics and ferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and\ncoercive fields. The theory predicts regimes of both \"proximity switching\"\nwhere the multilayers collectively switch, as well as \"proximity suppression\"\nwhere they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximity\nferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by the polarization\nof the layers and their relative thickness in a self-consistent manner that\nrenormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of\nthe switching barrier. Further reduction in the coercive field emerges from\ncharged defects in the bulk that act as nucleation centers. The application of\nthe theory to proximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO\nbilayers is demonstrated. The theory further predicts that multilayers of\ndielectric/ferroelectric and paraelectric/ferroelectric layers can potentially\nresult in induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric or paraelectric layers,\nresulting in the entire stack being switched, an exciting avenue for new\ndiscoveries. This thawing of \"frozen ferroelectrics\", paraelectrics and\npotentially dielectrics, promises a large class of new ferroelectrics with\nexciting prospects for previously unrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic\nand memory technologies.",

    "abstract": "Communication has been widely employed to enhance multi-agent collaboration.\nPrevious research has typically assumed delay-free communication, a strong\nassumption that is challenging to meet in practice. However, real-world agents\nsuffer from channel delays, receiving messages sent at different time points,\ntermed {\\it{Asynchronous Communication}}, leading to cognitive biases and\nbreakdowns in collaboration. This paper first defines two communication delay\nsettings in MARL and emphasizes their harm to collaboration. To handle the\nabove delays, this paper proposes a novel framework, Communication\nDelay-tolerant Multi-Agent Collaboration (CoDe). At first, CoDe learns an\nintent representation as messages through future action inference, reflecting\nthe stable future behavioral trends of the agents. Then, CoDe devises a dual\nalignment mechanism of intent and timeliness to strengthen the fusion process\nof asynchronous messages. In this way, agents can extract the long-term intent\nof others, even from delayed messages, and selectively utilize the most recent\nmessages that are relevant to their intent. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat CoDe outperforms baseline algorithms in three MARL benchmarks without\ndelay and exhibits robustness under fixed and time-varying delays.",

The thresholdless interaction of coherent elastic scattering\nof neutrinos on atomic nuclei leads to greatly enhanced interaction rates,\nwhich allows for much smaller detectors. The study of this process gives\ninsights into physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The CONUS+\nexperiment was designed to first detect elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering in\nthe fully coherent regime with low-energy neutrinos produced in nuclear\nreactors. For this purpose, semi-conductor detectors based on high-purity\ngermanium crystals with extremely low-energy thresholds were developed. Here we\nreport the first observation of a neutrino signal with a statistical\nsignificance of 3.7 sigma from the CONUS+ experiment, operated at the nuclear\npower plant in Leibstadt, Switzerland. In 119 days of reactor operation\n(395$\\pm$106) neutrinos were measured compared with a predicted number from\ncalculations assuming Standard Model physics of (347$\\pm$59) events. With\nincreased precision, there is potential for fundamental discoveries in the\nfuture.

To leverage advancements and\novercome the limitations of drones in providing intra-city express services, we\nintroduce a coordinated drone-courier logistics system where drones operate\nwithin a closed network among vertiports, while couriers connect customers to\nthe drone delivery system. This paper aims to shed light on this coordinated\nsystem in terms of system feasibility, network interactivity, and long-term\nsustainability. Methodology/Results: We develop an integrated optimization\nmodel to optimize the network planning of the coordinated logistics system. The\ninterplay between network planning and tactical operations is mirrored by a\nqueueing network model, resulting in the nonlinear and nonconvex (partially\nconvex and partially concave) feasible region of the optimization model. An\niterative exact algorithm that tightens lower and upper bounds by adaptively\nrefining the linear approximations of nonlinear constraints is developed to\nprovide optimality-guaranteed solutions with finite convergence. The\ncomputational experiments demonstrate the scalability and robustness of our\nalgorithm across various network configurations and scenarios.Managerial\nimplications: The case study, based on a real-world dataset from SF Express, a\nlogistics giant in China, validates that the coordinated logistics system\nefficiently attains cost and time savings by leveraging the effective turnover\nof drones and the coordination between drones and couriers.

We\ndemonstrate that commonly used statistical measures for quantifying inequity\nare insufficient, and focus on attributing the observed disparity to the causal\nmechanisms that generate it.

At the same time,\nhowever, we find a protective direct effect of belonging to a minority group,\nwith minority patients showing improved survival compared to their majority\ncounterparts, with all other variables kept equal. We demonstrate that this\nprotective effect is related to the increased probability of being admitted to\nICU, with minority patients having an increased risk of ICU admission. We also\nfind that minority patients, while showing improved survival, are more likely\nto be readmitted to ICU. Thus, due to worse access to primary health care,\nminority patients are more likely to end up in ICU for preventable conditions,\ncausing a reduction in the mortality rates and creating an effect that appears\nto be protective.

Predicting the\nformation of such skin layer or particle shell and its properties is a crucial\nproblem for applications and constitutes a multi-scale problem, from the\nmicro/nanoscopic scale of the particles to the millimetric size of the\ndroplets. Interestingly, its physical description lies at the interface between\ndeterministic macroscopic evaporation models and microscopic stochastic\nparticles interactions and diffusion. In this work we present a general\ntheoretical approach to obtain the time-dependent particle concentration\nprofile in an implicit manner, for the general case of diffusion-limited\nevaporation of spherical droplets, and more generally to all 1D non linear\ndiffusion-limited cases with particles pressure and mobility terms of rational\nform. This approach is compared successfully to numerical solutions obtained\nusing a finite element solver in the limit of high P\\'eclet numbers, and to 2D\nBrownian dynamics simulations. Our results show that the concentration profiles\nand shell formation onset depend nontrivially on the initial packing fraction.\nBy analyzing these profiles, we determine the position where the glassy layer\nforms, whose formation is expected to play a critical role in shell buckling.\nThis model provides a robust framework for predicting the size and maximum\naspect ratio of the resulting clusters.",

    "abstract": "Accurate determination of higher-order pressure derivatives with respect to\ntemperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu$ is essential for analyzing\ncritical phenomena, transport properties, and phase transitions in strongly\ninteracting matter. However, standard numerical differentiation methods often\nsuffer from large numerical instabilities, especially in more complex\nmean-field thermal field theories. In this work, we present an approach that\nsystematically derives symbolic expressions for these higher-order derivatives,\nbypassing the numerical instabilities commonly encountered in conventional\nmethods. Our formalism is based on a Jacobian technique, which ensures that the\ndependence of internal mean-field parameters is fully incorporated into the\nfinal symbolic expressions. We illustrate the effectiveness of this method\nusing the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model as an example and show that it is\nparticularly advantageous near phase transitions and at low temperatures, where\nnumerical differentiation becomes highly sensitive.",

    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at visual understanding, but face\nefficiency challenges due to quadratic complexity in processing long\nmulti-modal contexts. While token compression can reduce computational costs,\nexisting approaches are designed for single-view LVLMs and fail to consider the\nunique multi-view characteristics of high-resolution LVLMs with dynamic\ncropping. Existing methods treat all tokens uniformly, but our analysis reveals\nthat global thumbnails can naturally guide the compression of local crops by\nproviding holistic context for informativeness evaluation. In this paper, we\nfirst analyze dynamic cropping strategy, revealing both the complementary\nnature between thumbnails and crops, and the distinctive characteristics across\ndifferent crops. Based on our observations, we propose \"Global Compression\nCommander\" (GlobalCom$^2$), a novel plug-and-play token compression framework\nfor HR-LVLMs. GlobalCom$^2$ leverages thumbnail as the \"commander\" to guide the\ncompression of local crops, adaptively preserving informative details while\neliminating redundancy. Extensive experiments show that GlobalCom$^2$ maintains\nover 90% performance while compressing 90% visual tokens, reducing FLOPs and\npeak memory to 9.1% and 60%.

The passivation problem in our\nframework corresponds to finding a perturbation to a given non-passive system\nthat renders the system passive while minimizing the $\\mathcal{H}_2$ or\nfrequency-weighted $\\mathcal{H}_2$ distance between the original non-passive\nand the resulting passive system. We show that this problem can be formulated\nas an unconstrained optimization problem whose objective function can be\ndifferentiated efficiently even in large-scale settings. We show that any\nminimizer of the unconstrained problem yields the same passive system.\nFurthermore, we prove that, in the absence of a feedthrough term, every local\nminimizer is also a global minimizer. For cases involving a non-trivial\nfeedthrough term, we analyze global minimizers in relation to the extremal\nsolutions of the Lur'e equations, which can serve as tools for identifying\nlocal minima. To solve the resulting numerical optimization problem\nefficiently, we propose an initialization strategy based on modifying the\nfeedthrough term and a restart strategy when it is likely that the optimization\nhas converged to a local minimum.

Although existing methods produce high-quality outputs, they\noften fail to faithfully preserve the individual's identity.

Additionally, thanks to the\nrobustness of the identity encoder, synthesized images can be used as reference\nimages during training, and identity changing during inference does not require\nfine-tuning the model. We also propose a pipeline for constructing a reference\nimage training pool that simulates the poses and expressions that may appear in\nreal-world scenarios.

Current metrics, such as BLEU,\nprimarily rely on lexical similarity between generated and reference reviews.\nHowever, such metrics tend to underestimate reviews that articulate the\nexpected issues in ways different from the references. In this paper, we\nexplore how semantic similarity between generated and reference reviews can\nenhance the automated assessment of code reviews. We first present a benchmark\ncalled \\textit{GradedReviews}, which is constructed by collecting real-world\ncode reviews from open-source projects, generating reviews using\nstate-of-the-art approaches, and manually assessing their quality. We then\nevaluate existing metrics for code review assessment using this benchmark,\nrevealing their limitations. To address these limitations, we propose two novel\nsemantic-based approaches for assessing code reviews. The first approach\ninvolves converting both the generated review and its reference into digital\nvectors using a deep learning model and then measuring their semantic\nsimilarity through Cosine similarity. The second approach generates a prompt\nbased on the generated review and its reference, submits this prompt to\nChatGPT, and requests ChatGPT to rate the generated review according to\nexplicitly defined criteria. Our evaluation on the \\textit{GradedReviews}\nbenchmark indicates that the proposed semantic-based approaches significantly\noutperform existing state-of-the-art metrics in assessing generated code\nreview, improving the correlation coefficient between the resulting scores and\nhuman scores from 0.22 to 0.47.",

    "abstract": "Most stars form in dense clusters within high-mass star-forming regions,\nwhere protoplanetary disks may be exposed to intense UV radiation from nearby\nmassive stars. While previous studies have typically focused on isolated\nsources in low-mass regions, recent observational campaigns have started to\nprobe the chemistry of irradiated disks in unprecedented detail. Interpreting\nthis data requires complex chemical models, yet few studies have examined these\ndisks' chemistry, and none have incorporated the photoevaporative wind launched\nby external UV fields into their physical structure. In this study, we\npost-process radiation hydrodynamics simulations of externally irradiated\nprotoplanetary disks using the thermochemical code DALI, comparing models with\nand without the wind to assess its impact on disk chemistry. Results show that\nUV radiation is rapidly attenuated by the disk in both cases. However, thermal\nre-emission from the wind at longer wavelengths enhances disk heating,\nincreasing the gas-phase abundances of some key volatiles. Synthetic line\nfluxes vary by orders of magnitude between wind and windless models, primarily\ndue to emission from the wind itself rather than abundance variations within\nthe disk. Our findings demonstrate that the photoevaporative wind significantly\ninfluences the physical and chemical structure, and observational\ncharacteristics, of externally irradiated disks. We conclude that incorporating\nthe wind into chemical models is essential for accurately predicting chemical\nabundances, interpreting observations, and ultimately understanding planet\nformation in these common yet complex environments.",

We provide axiomatic\ncharacterizations of the UD-value motivated by characterizations of the\nIC-value and discuss further properties such as fairness and balanced\ncontributions.

We\nleverage the mesoscale nature of AP-MPCD to explore flocking in the presence of\nexternal fields, which destroys banding, and anisotropic obstacles, which act\nas a ratchet that biases the flocking direction.

    "abstract": "Superconductors, which are crucial for modern advanced technologies due to\ntheir zero-resistance properties, are limited by low Tc and the difficulty of\naccurate prediction. This article made the initial endeavor to apply machine\nlearning to predict the critical temperature (Tc) of liquid metal (LM) alloy\nsuperconductors. Leveraging the SuperCon dataset, which includes extensive\nsuperconductor property data, we developed a machine learning model to predict\nTc. After addressing data issues through preprocessing, we compared multiple\nmodels and found that the Extra Trees model outperformed others with an R2 of\n0.9519 and an RMSE of 6.2624 K. This model is subsequently used to predict Tc\nfor LM alloys, revealing In0.5Sn0.5 as having the highest Tc at 7.01 K.\nFurthermore, we extended the prediction to 2,145 alloys binary and 45,670\nternary alloys across 66 metal elements and promising results were achieved.\nThis work demonstrates the advantages of tree-based models in predicting Tc and\nwould help accelerate the discovery of high-performance LM alloy\nsuperconductors in the coming time.",

Existing Bio-RE methods struggle\nwith cross-sentence inference, which is essential for capturing relations\nspanning multiple sentences. Moreover, previous methods often overlook the\nincompleteness of documents and lack the integration of external knowledge,\nlimiting contextual richness. Besides, the scarcity of annotated data further\nhampers model training. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)\nhave inspired us to explore all the above issues for document-level Bio-RE.\nSpecifically, we propose a document-level Bio-RE framework via LLM Adaptive\nDocument-Relation Cross-Mapping (ADRCM) Fine-Tuning and Concept Unique\nIdentifier (CUI) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). First, we introduce the\nIteration-of-REsummary (IoRs) prompt for solving the data scarcity issue. In\nthis way, Bio-RE task-specific synthetic data can be generated by guiding\nChatGPT to focus on entity relations and iteratively refining synthetic data.\nNext, we propose ADRCM fine-tuning, a novel fine-tuning recipe that establishes\nmappings across different documents and relations, enhancing the model's\ncontextual understanding and cross-sentence inference capabilities. Finally,\nduring the inference, a biomedical-specific RAG approach, named CUI RAG, is\ndesigned to leverage CUIs as indexes for entities, narrowing the retrieval\nscope and enriching the relevant document contexts.

To\nvalidate the technique, we carried out several observing campaigns of\nwell-known binary stars with FastCam on the 1.52 m TCS and 2.56 m NOT. The\nprojected angular separation between objects was resolved by applying LIST with\na result below 0.15\". It can go down to approximately 0.05\", given the\nlimitations of the detector plate scale.

The average accuracy\nachieved for the angular separation measurement is 16 mas with NOT and is 20\nmas with TCS. The average accuracy obtained for the position angle measurement\nis $9.5^o$ for NOT and $11^o$ for TCS.

Lucky imaging, in combination with\nspeckle suppression and a covariance analysis, can allow the resolution of\nmultiple point sources below the diffraction limit of 2-m class telescopes.\nHowever, it should be noted that measurements in the super-resolution regime\nare less sensitive than those above the first Airy ring.",

A companion paper summarises our results for cognitive scientists; the\ncurrent paper gives formal definitions and proofs.\n  To formalise the concept of a system that behaves as if it were pursuing a\ngoal, we consider what happens when a transducer (a 'policy') is coupled to\nanother transducer that comes equipped with a success condition (a\n'teleo-environment'). An optimal policy is identified with a transducer that\nbehaves as if it were perfectly rational in the pursuit of a goal; our\nframework also allows us to model constrained rationality.\n  Optimal policies obey a version of Bellman's principle: a policy that's\noptimal in one time step will again be optimal in the next time step, but with\nrespect to a different teleo-environment (obtained from the original one by a\nmodified version of Bayesian filtering). This property sometimes also applies\nto the bounded-rational case; we give a sufficient condition.\n  A policy is deterministic if and only if there exists a teleo-environment for\nwhich it is uniquely optimal among the set of all policies; we relate this to\nclassical representation theorems from decision theory. This result need not\nhold in the bounded-rational case; we give an example related to the\nabsent-minded driver problem. The formalism is defined using coinduction,\nfollowing the style proposed by Czajka.",

Traditional techniques rely on handcrafted features\nthat often struggle to generalise to diverse scenes and require extensive\nmanual tuning. However, DL models for DE can automatically extract relevant\nfeatures from input data, adapt to various scene conditions, and generalise\nwell to unseen environments. Numerous DL-based methods have been developed,\nmaking it necessary to survey and synthesize the state-of-the-art (SOTA).\nPrevious reviews on DE have mainly focused on either monocular or stereo-based\ntechniques, rather than comprehensively reviewing DE. Furthermore, to the best\nof our knowledge, there is no systematic literature review (SLR) that\ncomprehensively focuses on DE. Therefore, this SLR study is being conducted.\nInitially, electronic databases were searched for relevant publications,\nresulting in 1284 publications. Using defined exclusion and quality criteria,\n128 publications were shortlisted and further filtered to select 59\nhigh-quality primary studies. These studies were analysed to extract data and\nanswer defined research questions. Based on the results, DL methods were\ndeveloped for mainly three different types of DE: monocular, stereo, and\nmulti-view. 20 publicly available datasets were used to train, test, and\nevaluate DL models for DE, with KITTI, NYU Depth V2, and Make 3D being the most\nused datasets. 29 evaluation metrics were used to assess the performance of DE.\n35 base models were reported in the primary studies, and the top five most-used\nbase models were ResNet-50, ResNet-18, ResNet-101, U-Net, and VGG-16.

Here, we propose that G3425\noriginates from a triple through a triple common envelope (TCE) evolution. The\nG3425 progenitor originally may consist of three stars with masses of 1.49\nM$_{\\odot}$, 1.05 M$_{\\odot}$, and 21.81 M$_{\\odot}$, and inner and outer\norbital periods of 4.22 days and 1961.78 days, respectively. As evolution\nproceeds, the tertiary fills its Roche lobe, leading to a TCE. We find that the\norbital energy generated by the inspiral of the inner binary serves as an\nadditional energy imparted for ejecting the common envelope (CE), accounting\nfor $\\sim$97\\% of the binding energy in our calculations. This means that the\nouter orbit needs to expend only a small amount of the orbital energy to\nsuccessfully eject CE. The outcome of the TCE is a binary consisting of a 2.54\nM$_\\odot$ merger produced by the inner binary merger and a 7.67 M$_\\odot$\nhelium star whose CE successfully ejected, with an orbital period of 547.53\ndays. The resulting post-TCE binary (PTB) has an orbital period that is 1-2\norders of magnitude greater than the orbital period of a successfully ejected\nclassical binary CE. In subsequent simulations, we find that the successfully\nejected helium star has a 44.2\\% probability of forming a BH. In the case of a\nnon-complete fallback forming a BH, with an ejected mass of 2.6 M$_{\\odot}$ and\na relatively low natal kick ($11^{+16}_{-5}$ ${\\rm km/s}$ to $49^{+39}_{-39}$\n${\\rm km/s}$), this PTB can form G3425 in the Milky Way.",

This mechanism can be used to create an exponential\nhierarchy in the coupling between two fields by placing them at opposite ends\nof the lattice chain. Extending this mechanism, we show that when copies of\nsuch fields are appropriately attached to the lattice chain, it leads to the\nemergence of multiple massless modes. These vanishing masses are a direct\nconsequence of the locality of interactions in theory space. The latter may\nbreak down in an ordered and deterministic manner through quantum effects if\nadditional interactions exist among the chain fields. Such non-locality can\ninduce small masses for the otherwise massless modes without necessarily\ndelocalising the mass eigenstates.

Notably, the emergence of chimeric states suggests the\ncrucial role of non-stationarity in phase interactions for spontaneous\npopulation clustering. Additionally, we examine how phase non-stationarity\ninfluences the spatial positions of swarmalators and provide a classification\nof these states based on different order parameters.",

This paper presents a novel\nreal-time streaming perception method named CorrDiff, designed to tackle the\nchallenge of delays in real-time detection systems. The main contribution of\nCorrDiff lies in its adaptive delay-aware detector, which is able to utilize\nruntime-estimated temporal cues to predict objects' locations for multiple\nfuture frames, and selectively produce predictions that matches real-world\ntime, effectively compensating for any communication and computational delays.\nThe proposed model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by leveraging\nmotion estimation and feature enhancement, both for 1) single-frame detection\nfor the current frame or the next frame, in terms of the metric mAP, and 2) the\nprediction for (multiple) future frame(s), in terms of the metric sAP (The sAP\nmetric is to evaluate object detection algorithms in streaming scenarios,\nfactoring in both latency and accuracy). It demonstrates robust performance\nacross a range of devices, from powerful Tesla V100 to modest RTX 2080Ti,\nachieving the highest level of perceptual accuracy on all platforms. Unlike\nmost state-of-the-art methods that struggle to complete computation within a\nsingle frame on less powerful devices, CorrDiff meets the stringent real-time\nprocessing requirements on all kinds of devices. The experimental results\nemphasize the system's adaptability and its potential to significantly improve\nthe safety and reliability for many real-world systems, such as autonomous\ndriving.

    "abstract": "The growing demand for controllable outputs in text-to-image generation has\ndriven significant advancements in multi-instance generation (MIG), enabling\nusers to define both instance layouts and attributes. Currently, the\nstate-of-the-art methods in MIG are primarily adapter-based. However, these\nmethods necessitate retraining a new adapter each time a more advanced model is\nreleased, resulting in significant resource consumption. A methodology named\nDepth-Driven Decoupled Instance Synthesis (3DIS) has been introduced, which\ndecouples MIG into two distinct phases: 1) depth-based scene construction and\n2) detail rendering with widely pre-trained depth control models. The 3DIS\nmethod requires adapter training solely during the scene construction phase,\nwhile enabling various models to perform training-free detail rendering.\nInitially, 3DIS focused on rendering techniques utilizing U-Net architectures\nsuch as SD1.5, SD2, and SDXL, without exploring the potential of recent\nDiT-based models like FLUX. In this paper, we present 3DIS-FLUX, an extension\nof the 3DIS framework that integrates the FLUX model for enhanced rendering\ncapabilities. Specifically, we employ the FLUX.1-Depth-dev model for depth map\ncontrolled image generation and introduce a detail renderer that manipulates\nthe Attention Mask in FLUX's Joint Attention mechanism based on layout\ninformation. This approach allows for the precise rendering of fine-grained\nattributes of each instance. Our experimental results indicate that 3DIS-FLUX,\nleveraging the FLUX model, outperforms the original 3DIS method, which utilized\nSD2 and SDXL, and surpasses current state-of-the-art adapter-based methods in\nterms of both performance and image quality.

This detector is required to have a detection efficiency above 90 % with\nfour active gaps in the muon beam due to the limitation of the material budget.\nIn such an environment, the high current flowing through the resistive\nelectrodes causes a voltage drop, which reduces the performance of the DLC-RPC.\nThis voltage drop can be suppressed by implementing a current evacuation\npattern, though discharges are more likely to occur near the pattern. Therefore\nthe pattern must be covered by a protection cover made of an insulator. In this\nstudy, electrode samples with a current evacuation pattern and different widths\nof protection cover (0.2 mm and 0.8 mm) have been produced, and their\nperformance and stability were measured.

Here we report the first identification in space\nof a new S-bearing molecule, thioacetaldehyde (CH3CHS), which is the sulfur\ncounterpart of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). The astronomical observations are part of\nQUIJOTE, a Yebes 40m Q band line survey of the cold dense cloud TMC-1. We\ndetected seven individual lines corresponding to A and E components of the four\nmost favorable rotational transitions of CH3CHS covered in the Q band\n(31.0-50.3 GHz). Assuming a rotational temperature of 9 K, we derive a column\ndensity of 9.8e10 cm-2 for CH3CHS, which implies that it is 36 times less\nabundant than its oxygen counterpart CH3CHO. By comparing the column densities\nof the O- and S-bearing molecules detected in TMC-1, we find that as molecules\nincrease their degree of hydrogenation, sulfur-bearing molecules become less\nabundant compared to their oxygen analog. That is, hydrogenation seems to be\nless favored for S-bearing molecules than for O-bearing ones in cold sources\nlike TMC-1. We explored potential formation pathways to CH3CHS and implemented\nthem into a chemical model, which however underestimates by several orders of\nmagnitude the observed abundance of thioacetaldehyde.

Here we\ninvestigate the optimization of ultrafast photoacoustics in various solid thin\nfilms. We perform systematic experiments aimed at maximizing the achievable\nsignal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in a given measurement time while limiting sample\ndamage. By varying pump and probe pulse energies, average pump fluence, and\nrepetition rate, we identify different paths towards optimal SNR depending on\nmaterial properties. Our results provide a strategy for the design of\npump-probe experiments, to optimize achievable SNR for samples in which\ndifferent damage mechanisms may dominate.",

    "abstract": "Tumor volume segmentation on MRI is a challenging and time-consuming process\nthat is performed manually in typical clinical settings. This work presents an\napproach to automated delineation of head and neck tumors on MRI scans,\ndeveloped in the context of the MICCAI Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation for\nMR-Guided Applications (HNTS-MRG) 2024 Challenge. Rather than designing a new,\ntask-specific convolutional neural network, the focus of this research was to\npropose improvements to the configuration commonly used in medical segmentation\ntasks, relying solely on the traditional U-Net architecture. The empirical\nresults presented in this article suggest the superiority of patch-wise\nnormalization used for both training and sliding window inference. They also\nindicate that the performance of segmentation models can be enhanced by\napplying a scheduled data augmentation policy during training. Finally, it is\nshown that a small improvement in quality can be achieved by using Gaussian\nweighting to combine predictions for individual patches during sliding window\ninference.

    "abstract": "Bandit optimization is a difficult problem, especially if the reward model is\nhigh-dimensional. When rewards are modeled by neural networks, sublinear regret\nhas only been shown under strong assumptions, usually when the network is\nextremely wide. In this thesis, we investigate how pre-training can help us in\nthe regime of smaller models. We consider a stochastic contextual bandit with\nthe rewards modeled by a multi-layer neural network. The last layer is a linear\npredictor, and the layers before it are a black box neural architecture, which\nwe call a representation network. We model pre-training as an initial guess of\nthe weights of the representation network provided to the learner. To leverage\nthe pre-trained weights, we introduce a novel algorithm we call Explore Twice\nthen Commit (E2TC). During its two stages of exploration, the algorithm first\nestimates the last layer's weights using Ridge regression, and then runs\nStochastic Gradient Decent jointly on all the weights. For a locally convex\nloss function, we provide conditions on the pre-trained weights under which the\nalgorithm can learn efficiently. Under these conditions, we show sublinear\nregret of E2TC when the dimension of the last layer and number of actions $K$\nare much smaller than the horizon $T$. In the weak training regime, when only\nthe last layer is learned, the problem reduces to a misspecified linear bandit.\nWe introduce a measure of misspecification $\\epsilon_0$ for this bandit and use\nit to provide bounds $O(\\epsilon_0\\sqrt{d}KT+(KT)^{4 /5})$ or\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon_0\\sqrt{d}KT+d^{1 /3}(KT)^{2 /3})$ on the regret, depending\non regularization strength. The first of these bounds has a\ndimension-independent sublinear term, made possible by the stochasticity of\ncontexts. We also run experiments to evaluate the regret of E2TC and sample\ncomplexity of its exploration in practice.",

The seminal work in this\nfield is the 1973 Larch\\'{e}-Cahn paper (Acta Metall. 21, 1051-1063).\nSingle-phase crystals in Larch\\'{e}-Cahn theory are stable under open constant\npressure, constant temperature conditions. The Gibbs free energy does not have\nto match the product $\\mu N$ of the number of particles $N$ and their chemical\npotential $\\mu$. Similarly, the grand potential and the product $pV$ of\npressure and volume $V$ may not add up to zero. Discrepancies already arise\nunder hydrostatic stress. The elastic energy is not proportional to volume and\nthe Gibbs-Duhem relation valid for liquids is violated. Extensivity is\nrecovered by treating the number of lattice sites $M$ as an additional\nthermodynamic variable. The difference $ G-\\mu N $ can be identified with $\\nu\nM$ where $\\nu$ is the thermodynamic force conjugate to $M$.

In this work,\nwe model the coronal evolution around 231 large flares observed during solar\ncycle 24. Using Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager vector magnetic field data\naround each event, we employed nonlinear force-free field extrapolations to\napproximate the coronal energy and helicity budgets of the solar source\nregions. A superposed epoch analysis and dynamical time warping applied to the\ntime series of selected photospheric and coronal quantities were used to pin\ndown the characteristics of the pre- and postflare time evolution, as well as\nto assess flare-related changes. During the 24 hours leading up to a major\nflare, the total magnetic energy and unsigned magnetic flux were seen to evolve\nclosely with respect to each other, irrespective of the flare type. Prior to\nconfined flares, the free energy evolves in a way that exhibits more of a\nsimilarity with the unsigned flux than the helicity of the current-carrying\nfield, while the opposite trend is seen prior to eruptive flares. Furthermore,\nthe flare type can be predicted correctly in more than 90\\% of major flares\nwhen combining measures of the active regions nonpotentiality and local\nstability. The coronal energy and helicity budgets return to preflare levels\nwithin approximately six to 12 hours after eruptive major M-class flares, while\nthe impact of eruptive X-flares lasts considerably longer. Finally, the\npostflare replenishment times of more than 12 hours after eruptive X-class\nflares may serve as a partial explanation for the rare observation of eruptive\nX-class flares within a time frame of a few hours.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring complex assembly processes is critical for maintaining\nproductivity and ensuring compliance with assembly standards. However,\nvariability in human actions and subjective task preferences complicate\naccurate task anticipation and guidance. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce the Multi-Modal Transformer Fusion and Recurrent Units (MMTFRU)\nNetwork for egocentric activity anticipation, utilizing multimodal fusion to\nimprove prediction accuracy. Integrated with the Operator Action Monitoring\nUnit (OAMU), the system provides proactive operator guidance, preventing\ndeviations in the assembly process. OAMU employs two strategies: (1) Top-5\nMMTF-RU predictions, combined with a reference graph and an action dictionary,\nfor next-step recommendations; and (2) Top-1 MMTF-RU predictions, integrated\nwith a reference graph, for detecting sequence deviations and predicting\nanomaly scores via an entropy-informed confidence mechanism. We also introduce\nTime-Weighted Sequence Accuracy (TWSA) to evaluate operator efficiency and\nensure timely task completion. Our approach is validated on the industrial\nMeccano dataset and the largescale EPIC-Kitchens-55 dataset, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in dynamic environments.",

In contrast, there is a notable gap in terms of investigations of\nthe moderate-to-low density situations. These scenarios are extremely\ncommonplace across the world, including the highly populated nations like\nIndia. Additionally, the details of force-based models are expected to show\nsignificant effects at these densities, whereas the crowded, nearly packed,\nconditions may be expected to be governed largely by contact forces. In this\nstudy, we address this gap and comprehensively evaluate the performance of\ndifferent force-based models in some common scenarios. Towards this, we perform\ncontrolled experiments in four situations: avoiding a stationary obstacle,\nposition-swapping by walking toward each other, overtaking to reach a common\ngoal, and navigating through a maze of obstacles. The performance evaluation\nconsists of two stages and six evaluating parameters - successful trajectories,\noverlapping proportion, oscillation strength, path smoothness, speed deviation,\nand travel time. Firstly, models must meet an eligibility criterion of at least\n80\\% successful trajectories and secondly, the models are scored based on the\ncutoff values established from the experimental data. We evaluated five\nforce-based models where the best one scored 57.14\\%.

These variable goals function as an adaptive guidance\nmechanism, enabling smoother transitions and dynamic navigation. VGA also\nenhances the efficiency of a model while minimizing interactions and\ndisruptions. By strategically positioning variable goals, VGA introduces an\nelement of stochasticity. This allows the model to simulate varied pedestrian\npaths under identical conditions, reflecting the diversity in human\ndecision-making.

However, how the brain\nnetwork structure affects these dynamics after an injury (stroke) is not very\nclear. The recovery of structure and dynamics of stroke brain networks over\ntime is still not known precisely. Based on the analysis of a large number of\nstrokes' brain network data, we show that stroke changes the network properties\nin connection weights, average degree, clustering, community, etc. Yet, they\nwill recover gradually over time to some extent. We then adopt a simplified\nreaction-diffusion model to investigate stroke patients' activation propagation\nand self-sustained oscillation abilities. Our results reveal that the stroke\nslows the adoption time across different brain scales, indicating a weakened\nbrain's activation propagation ability. In addition, we show that the lifetime\nof self-sustained oscillatory patterns at three months post-stroke patients'\nbrains significantly departs from the healthy one. Finally, we examine the\nproperties of core networks of self-sustained oscillatory patterns, in which\nthe directed edges denote the main pathways of activation propagation. Our\nresults demonstrate that the lifetime and recovery of self-sustaining patterns\nare related to the properties of core networks, and the properties in the\npost-stroke greatly vary from those in the healthy group.

Our dataset comprises ALS point clouds collected\nacross the contiguous United States, provided by the United States Geological\nSurvey's 3D Elevation Program. To ensure efficient data collection while\ncapturing diverse land cover and terrain types, we introduce a geospatial\nsampling method that selects point cloud tiles based on land cover maps and\ndigital elevation models. As a baseline self-supervised learning model, we\nadopt BEV-MAE, a state-of-the-art masked autoencoder for 3D outdoor point\nclouds, and pre-train it on the constructed dataset. The pre-trained models are\nsubsequently fine-tuned for downstream tasks, including tree species\nclassification, terrain scene recognition, and point cloud semantic\nsegmentation. Our results show that the pre-trained models significantly\noutperform their scratch counterparts across all downstream tasks,\ndemonstrating the transferability of the representations learned from the\nproposed dataset.

Despite the existing techniques aiming to accelerate sampling, they\noften compromise performance when fusing multi-source images. To ease this\nlimitation, we introduce a novel and efficient diffusion model named Diffusion\nModel for Pansharpening by Inferring Residual Inference (ResPanDiff), which\nsignificantly reduces the number of diffusion steps without sacrificing the\nperformance to tackle pansharpening task. In ResPanDiff, we innovatively\npropose a Markov chain that transits from noisy residuals to the residuals\nbetween the LRMS and HRMS images, thereby reducing the number of sampling steps\nand enhancing performance. Additionally, we design the latent space to help\nmodel extract more features at the encoding stage, Shallow\nCond-Injection~(SC-I) to help model fetch cond-injected hidden features with\nhigher dimensions, and loss functions to give a better guidance for the\nresidual generation task. enabling the model to achieve superior performance in\nresidual generation. Furthermore, experimental evaluations on pansharpening\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior outcomes\ncompared to recent state-of-the-art~(SOTA) techniques, requiring only 15\nsampling steps, which reduces over $90\\%$ step compared with the benchmark\ndiffusion models.

The solution to this dilemma is related to\nunderstanding the plasticiser migration which has a few practical implications\nfor the state of museum artefacts made of plasticised poly(vinyl chloride) -\nPVC and objects stored in their vicinity. The consequences of this process\nencompass aesthetic changes due to the presence of exudates and dust\ndeposition, an increase in air pollution and the development of mechanical\nstresses. Therefore, this paper discusses the plasticiser migration in PVC to\nprovide evidence and support the development of recommendations and guidelines\nfor conservators, collection managers and heritage scientists. Particularly,\nthe investigation is focused on the migration of the ortho-phthalates\nrepresenting the group of the most abundant plasticisers in PVC collections.\nThe predominance of inner diffusion or surface emission (evaporation)\ndetermining the rate-limiting step of the overall migration process is\nconsidered a fundament for understanding the potential environmental and\nmechanical risk. According to this concept, general correlations for various\northo-phthalates are proposed depending on their molar mass with the support of\nmolecular dynamics simulations and NMR diffusometry. The study reveals that for\nthe majority of the PVC objects in collections, the risk of accelerated\nmigration upon mild removal of surface plasticiser exudate is low. Thus,\nsurface cleaning would allow for diminishing dust deposition and air pollution\nby phthalate-emitting objects in a museum environment. Bearing in mind\nsimplicity and the need for fast decision-supporting solutions, the\nstep-by-step protocol for non-destructive identification and quantification of\nplasticisers in objects made of or containing plasticised PVC, determination of\nthe physical state of investigated artefacts and rate-limiting process of\nplasticiser migration is proposed.",

To\nquantitatively assess the impact of the selection effect, we construct mock\ngalaxy catalogs from halos in N-body simulations by selecting halos above\nredshift-dependent mass thresholds such that the resulting redshift\ndistribution of the halos, $n(z)$, matches that of SDSS-like galaxies.

To\nfurther reduce the dose, the sparse-view and/or low-dose CT settings can be\napplied together with interior tomography. Interior tomography has various\nadvantages in terms of reducing the number of detectors and decreasing the\nX-ray radiation dose. However, a large patient or small field-of-view (FOV)\ndetector can cause truncated projections, and then the reconstructed images\nsuffer from severe cupping artifacts. In addition, although the low-dose CT can\nreduce the radiation exposure dose, analytic reconstruction algorithms produce\nimage noise. Recently, many researchers have utilized image-domain deep\nlearning (DL) approaches to remove each artifact and demonstrated impressive\nperformances, and the theory of deep convolutional framelets supports the\nreason for the performance improvement. Approach: In this paper, we found that\nthe image-domain convolutional neural network (CNN) is difficult to solve\ncoupled artifacts, based on deep convolutional framelets. Significance: To\naddress the coupled problem, we decouple it into two sub-problems: (i) image\ndomain noise reduction inside truncated projection to solve low-dose CT problem\nand (ii) extrapolation of projection outside truncated projection to solve the\nROI CT problem. The decoupled sub-problems are solved directly with a novel\nproposed end-to-end learning using dual-domain CNNs. Main results: We\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional image-domain\ndeep learning methods, and a projection-domain CNN shows better performance\nthan the image-domain CNNs which are commonly used by many researchers.",

Interpreting GNSS snapshots and the associated\ninterferences presents significant challenges due to the inherent complexity,\nincluding multipath effects, diverse interference types, varying sensor\ncharacteristics, and satellite constellations. In this paper, we extract\nfeatures from a large GNSS dataset and employ LLaVA to retrieve relevant\ninformation from an extensive knowledge base. We employ prompt engineering to\ninterpret the interferences and environmental factors, and utilize t-SNE to\nanalyze the feature embeddings. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod is capable of visual and logical reasoning within the GNSS context.\nFurthermore, our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models\nin interference classification tasks.",

Moreover, DDSS are constrained to a single structured\ndata modality, limiting their ability to incorporate additional contextual\nknowledge. Furthermore, DDSSs' limited representation learning leads to weak\npredictive performance with scarce data. To address these challenges, we\npropose a general framework named LLM-TKESS (large language model for\ntext-based knowledge-embedded soft sensing), harnessing the powerful general\nproblem-solving capabilities, cross-modal knowledge transfer abilities, and\nfew-shot capabilities of LLM for enhanced soft sensing modeling. Specifically,\nan auxiliary variable series encoder (AVS Encoder) is proposed to unleash LLM's\npotential for capturing temporal relationships within series and spatial\nsemantic relationships among auxiliary variables. Then, we propose a two-stage\nfine-tuning alignment strategy: in the first stage, employing\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning through autoregressive training adjusts LLM to\nrapidly accommodate process variable data, resulting in a soft sensing\nfoundation model (SSFM). Subsequently, by training adapters, we adapt the SSFM\nto various downstream tasks without modifying its architecture. Then, we\npropose two text-based knowledge-embedded soft sensors, integrating new natural\nlanguage modalities to overcome the limitations of pure structured data models.\nFurthermore, benefiting from LLM's pre-existing world knowledge, our model\ndemonstrates outstanding predictive capabilities in small sample conditions.\nUsing the thermal deformation of air preheater rotor as a case study, we\nvalidate through extensive experiments that LLM-TKESS exhibits outstanding\nperformance.",

It is found that, at altitudes from 50 km to 80 km, the\nmaximum relative difference in the pitch moment between the GSIS-SST and pure\nGSIS (SST) reaches 28% (20%). While the jet is supposed to reduce the surface\nheat flux, its turbulence significantly diminishes this reduction, e.g., the\nGSIS-SST predicts a heat flux about one order of magnitude higher than the GSIS\nwhen the jet pressure ratio is 1.5. Increasing the angle of attack intensifies\nlocal turbulence, resulting in expanded discrepancies in shear stress and heat\nflux between GSIS-SST and GSIS. These insights enhance our comprehension of\nlateral jet flows and highlight the importance of accounting for both turbulent\nand rarefaction effects in medium-altitude hypersonic flight.",

This\npaper introduces a flexible and scalable framework for retrieving a ranked list\nof moments from collection of videos in any length to match a text query, a\ntask termed Ranked Video Moment Retrieval (RVMR). Our framework, called\nSegment-Proposal-Ranking (SPR), simplifies the search process into three\nindependent stages: segment retrieval, proposal generation, and moment\nrefinement with re-ranking. Specifically, videos are divided into equal-length\nsegments with precomputed embeddings indexed offline, allowing efficient\nretrieval regardless of video length. For scalable online retrieval, both\nsegments and queries are projected into a shared feature space to enable\napproximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. Retrieved segments are then merged\ninto coarse-grained moment proposals. Then a refinement and re-ranking module\nis designed to reorder and adjust timestamps of the coarse-grained proposals.\nEvaluations on the TVR-Ranking dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with significant reductions in computational cost\nand processing time. The flexible design also allows for independent\nimprovements to each stage, making SPR highly adaptable for large-scale\napplications.",

By projecting galaxies into the 2D\nlatent space defined by the first three principal components (PCs) of their\nentire visible spectra, our method remains robust even when data from\nindividual emission lines are missing. We employ Gaussian kernel density\nestimates of the classical Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) activity classes in\nthe new classification subspace, adjusted according to their relative abundance\nin our S0 sample, to generate probability maps for star-forming, Seyfert,\ncomposite, and LINER galaxies. These maps closely mirror the canonical\ndistribution of BPT classes shown by the entire galaxy population,\ndemonstrating that our PC-based taxonomy effectively predicts the dominant\nionizing mechanisms through a probabilistic approach that provides a realistic\nreflection of galaxy activity and allows for refined class membership. Our\nanalysis further reveals that flux-limited BPT-like diagrams are inherently\nbiased against composite and star-forming galaxies due to their weaker [OIII]\nemission. Besides, it suggests that although most low-activity galaxies\nexcluded from these diagnostics exhibit visual spectra with LINER-like\ncharacteristics, their remaining activity is likely driven by mechanisms\nunrelated to either star formation or supermassive black hole accretion.

    "abstract": "Code completion aims at speeding up code writing by recommending to\ndevelopers the next tokens they are likely to type. Deep Learning (DL) models\npushed the boundaries of code completion by redefining what these coding\nassistants can do: We moved from predicting few code tokens to automatically\ngenerating entire functions. One important factor impacting the performance of\nDL-based code completion techniques is the context provided as input. With\n\"context\" we refer to what the model knows about the code to complete. In a\nsimple scenario, the DL model might be fed with a partially implemented\nfunction to complete. In this case, the context is represented by the\nincomplete function and, based on it, the model must generate a prediction. It\nis however possible to expand such a context to include additional information,\nlike the whole source code file containing the function to complete, which\ncould be useful to boost the prediction performance. In this work, we present\nan empirical study investigating how the performance of a DL-based code\ncompletion technique is affected by different contexts. We experiment with 8\ntypes of contexts and their combinations. These contexts include: (i) coding\ncontexts, featuring information extracted from the code base in which the code\ncompletion is invoked (e.g., code components structurally related to the one to\n\"complete\"); (ii) process context, with information aimed at depicting the\ncurrent status of the project in which a code completion task is triggered\n(e.g., a textual representation of open issues relevant for the code to\ncomplete); and (iii) developer contexts, capturing information about the\ndeveloper invoking the code completion (e.g., the APIs frequently used). Our\nresults show that additional contextual information can benefit the performance\nof DL-based code completion, with relative improvements up to +22% in terms of\ncorrect predictions.",

Carrier motion\nexhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct\nlow-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be\nunderstood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between\ncarrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS).\nHowever, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using\nthe hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a\ncompanion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the\none-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS\napproximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger\ninteractions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns\ndiffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In\ncontrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions,\nrelevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the\nsuper-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets\nin from the superdiffusive side on timescales comparable to the phonon period.\nThe low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at\napproximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings\nin this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of\nthe most advanced quantum--classical simulations. We expect that the\nqualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more\nrealistic phonon density of states.",

Focusing on models with discrete\nundamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved\nfrom the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been\nintegrated out. Our procedure relies on the general explicit expression of HEOM\nauxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals\nthat the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced\nby genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are\nsubtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the\nprocedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring\nappropriate hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical\nmobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model.

Such a paradigm shift comes with a number of implications\nrelated to how software will be written, maintained, and evolved. Also, these\nLLMs are extremely expensive to train, posing questions on their sustainability\nover time. Given their training cost, their ability to generalize, namely their\nability to work on task instances different from those on which they have been\ntrained, is an aspect worth being investigated. Previous work already showed\nthat transformer models can successfully support code completion in a\ncross-project setting. However, it is unclear whether LLM are able to\ngeneralize to inputs having lengths not seen during training. For example, it\nis known that training a model on short instances allows to substantially\nreduce the training cost. However, the extent to which such a model would\nprovide good performance on sequences having lengths not seen during training\nis not known. Many recent works in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tackled\nthis problem in the context of decoder-only LLMs, i.e., xPOS and ALiBi. To\nassess if these solutions extend to encoder-decoder LLMs usually adopted in the\ncode-related tasks, we present a large empirical study evaluating this\ngeneralization property of these and other encoding schemes proposed in the\nliterature, namely Sinusoidal, xPOS, ALiBi, and T5.

    "abstract": "The boxicity of a graph is the smallest dimension $d$ allowing a\nrepresentation of it as the intersection graph of a set of $d$-dimensional\naxis-parallel boxes. We present a simple general approach to determining the\nboxicity of a graph based on studying its ``interval-order subgraphs.''\n  The power of the method is first tested on the boxicity of some popular\ngraphs that have resisted previous attempts: the boxicity of the Petersen graph\nis $3$, and more generally, that of the Kneser-graphs $K(n,2)$ is $n-2$ if\n$n\\ge 5$, confirming a conjecture of Caoduro and Lichev [Discrete Mathematics,\nVol. 346, 5, 2023].\n  As every line graph is an induced subgraph of the complement of $K(n,2)$, the\ndeveloped tools show furthermore that line graphs have only a polynomial number\nof edge-maximal interval-order subgraphs. This opens the way to polynomial-time\nalgorithms for problems that are in general $NP$-hard: for the existence and\noptimization of interval-order subgraphs of line graphs, or of interval\ncompletions and the boxicity of their complement, if the boxicity is bounded.\n  We finally extend our approach to upper and lower bounding the boxicity of\nline graphs.",

The quality of the clustering is measured by\nconsidering the vector of cluster costs and then minimizing some monotone\nsymmetric norm of that vector (in particular, this includes the\n$\\ell_p$-norms). For the costs of the clusters we take the weight of a\nminimum-weight spanning tree on the objects in~$V_i$, which may serve as a\nproxy for the cost of traversing all objects in the cluster, but also as a\nshape-invariant measure of cluster density similar to Single-Linkage\nClustering.\n  This setting has been studied by Even, Garg, K\\\"onemann, Ravi, Sinha (Oper.\nRes.

We provide a careful adaptation of their\nalgorithm to compute solutions which are approximately optimal with respect to\nall monotone symmetric norms simultaneously, and show how to find them in\npolynomial time. In fact, our algorithm is purely combinatorial and can process\nmetric spaces with 10,000 points in less than a second.\n  As an extension, we also consider the case where instead of a target number\nof clusters we are provided with a set of depots in the space such that every\ncluster should contain at least one such depot. For this setting also we are\nable to give a polynomial time algorithm computing a constant factor\napproximation with respect to all monotone symmetric norms simultaneously.\n  To show that the algorithmic results are tight up to the precise constant of\napproximation attainable, we also prove that such clustering problems are\nalready APX-hard when considering only one single $\\ell_p$ norm for the\nobjective.",

It has been found that the magnetization\nreversal in short atomic chains occurs through the simultaneous reversal of all\nmagnetic moments. In contrast, the magnetization reversal in long atomic chains\nis facilitated by the formation of domain walls, which exhibit distinct\nstructures for Co and Fe atomic chains. Using the geodesic nudged elastic band\nmethod, we have determined the energy barriers for magnetization reversal in\nchains consisting of 5 to 100 atoms. Additionally, the frequency prefactors\nhave been calculated within the framework of the harmonic approximation of\ntransition state theory. Notably, the dependencies of these prefactors on chain\nlength and external magnetic field are significant and non-monotonic. We\npropose a theoretical approach that qualitatively describes the numerical\ndependencies for both the energy barriers and the frequency prefactors. The\nmagnetization curves derived from our theoretical estimates show qualitative\nagreement with the results of numerical calculations. This analytical approach\nenables the estimation of the coercive force of atomic chains across a wide\nrange of lengths, temperatures, sweeping rates, and model parameters.

The\nunit cell of one class is characterized by elements where deformations are\nlumped within a finite-degrees-of-freedom framework. In contrast, the other\nclass involves smeared deformation, modelled as flexurally deformable rods with\nsufficiently high axial compliance. Under increasing compressive load, the\nelasticity tensor of the equivalent material loses positive definiteness and\nsubsequently undergoes an ellipticity loss. Remarkably, in certain conditions,\nthis loss of stability is followed by a subsequent restabilization; that is,\nthe material re-enters the elliptic regime and even the positive definiteness\ndomain and simultaneously, the underlying elastic lattice returns to a stable\nstate.

One significant application of LLMs is in tackling\nsoftware engineering challenges, particularly in resolving real-world tasks on\nGitHub by fixing code based on the issues reported by the users. However, many\ncurrent approaches rely on proprietary LLMs, which limits reproducibility,\naccessibility, and transparency. The critical components of LLMs for addressing\nsoftware engineering issues and how their capabilities can be effectively\nenhanced remain unclear. To address these challenges, we introduce SWE-Fixer, a\nnovel open-source framework designed to effectively and efficiently resolve\nGitHub issues. SWE-Fixer comprises two essential modules: a code file retrieval\nmodule and a code editing module. The retrieval module employs BM25 along with\na lightweight model to achieve coarse-to-fine file retrieval. Subsequently, the\ncode editing module utilizes the other model to generate patches for the\nidentified files. To mitigate the lack of publicly available datasets, we\ncompile an extensive dataset that includes 110K GitHub issues along with their\ncorresponding patches and train the two models of SWE-Fixer separately. We\nassess our approach on the SWE-Bench Lite and Verified benchmarks, achieving\ncompetitive performance among open-source models with scores of 22.0% and\n30.2%. Furthermore, SWE-Fixer reaches state-of-the-art performance (24.7% on\nLite and 32.8% on Verified) with PASS_TO_PASS (P2P) filtering.

How to effectively correct scatter\nsignals in CT has always been a focal point of research for researchers. This\nwork presents a new framework for eliminating scatter artifacts in CT. In the\nframework, the interaction between photons and matter is characterized as a\nMarkov process, and the calculation of the scatter signal intensity in CT is\ntransformed into the computation of a $4n$-dimensional integral, where $n$ is\nthe highest scatter order. Given the low-frequency characteristics of scatter\nsignals in CT, this paper uses the quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method combined with\nforced fixed detection and down sampling to compute the integral. In the\nreconstruction process, the impact of scatter signals on the X-ray energy\nspectrum is considered. A scatter-corrected spectrum estimation method is\nproposed and applied to estimate the X-ray energy spectrum. Based on the\nFeldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm, a multi-module coupled reconstruction\nmethod, referred to as FDK-QMC-BM4D, has been developed to simultaneously\neliminate scatter artifacts, beam hardening artifacts, and noise in CT imaging.\nFinally, the effectiveness of the FDK-QMC-BM4D method is validated in the\nShepp-Logan phantom and head. Compared to the widely recognized Monte Carlo\nmethod, which is the most accurate method by now for estimating and correcting\nscatter signals in CT, the FDK-QMC-BM4D method improves the running speed by\napproximately $102$ times while ensuring accuracy. By integrating the mechanism\nof FDK-QMC-BM4D, this study offers a novel approach to addressing artifacts in\nclinical CT.",

In particular, the proposed detection scheme is based on\nSourcextractor software and on applying a new algorithm capable of associating\nmoving objects amongst different catalogues. After applying a suite of filters\nto improve the detection quality, we study the expected purity and completeness\nof the SSO detections. We also show how a Kohonen self-organising neural\nnetwork can be successfully trained (in an unsupervised fashion) to classify\nstars, galaxies, and SSOs.

We propose CKPD-FSCIL, a unified framework\nthat unlocks the underutilized capacity of pretrained weights, achieving a\nsuperior stability-plasticity balance with zero inference overhead. Our design\nintegrates two continuously adapting mechanisms: At the weight level, a\nContinuous Knowledge-Preserving Decomposition mechanism uses feature covariance\nto split each weight matrix into a frozen subspace that safeguards prior\nknowledge and a learnable, redundant subspace for new tasks. At the layer\nlevel, a Continuous Adaptive Layer Selection mechanism leverages an Adapter\nSensitivity Ratio to automatically select layers with the highest redundant\ncapacity and lowest forgetting risk for adaptation. By targeting only safe,\nhigh-potential subspaces and layers, CKPD-FSCIL enables efficient adaptation.\nAfter each session, the learned adapters are merged back into the original\nweights, ensuring zero additional parameters or FLOPs during inference.\nExtensive experiments on multiple FSCIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both adaptability and\nknowledge retention.

Here we make a major update of\nGNC~ by integrating stellar potential and adiabatic invariant theory, so that\nwe can study the self-consistent dynamics of NSCs with increasing mass of the\nMBH. We perform tests of the self-adaptation of cluster density due to MBH mass\ngrowth and Plummer core collapse, both finding consistent results with previous\nstudies, the latter having a core collapse time of $\\sim 17t_{\\rm rh}$ by GNC,\nwhere $t_{\\rm rh}$ is the time of half-mass relaxation. We use GNC~ to study\nthe cosmological evolution of the properties of NSC and the mass of MBH\nassuming that the mass growth of the MBH is due to loss-cone accretion of stars\n(e.g., tidal disruption of stars) and stellar black holes, and compare the\nsimulation results with the observations of NSCs in Milky-Way or near-by\ngalaxies.

Prior studies have designed\nattack noticeability measures on graphs, primarily using statistical tests to\ncompare the topology of original and (possibly) attacked graphs. However, we\nobserve two critical limitations in the existing measures. First, because the\nmeasures rely on simple rules, attackers can readily enhance their attacks to\nbypass them, reducing their attack \"noticeability\" and, yet, maintaining their\nattack performance. Second, because the measures naively leverage global\nstatistics, such as degree distributions, they may entirely overlook attacks\nuntil severe perturbations occur, letting the attacks be almost \"totally\nunnoticeable.\" To address the limitations, we introduce HideNSeek, a learnable\nmeasure for graph attack noticeability. First, to mitigate the bypass problem,\nHideNSeek learns to distinguish the original and (potential) attack edges using\na learnable edge scorer (LEO), which scores each edge on its likelihood of\nbeing an attack. Second, to mitigate the overlooking problem, HideNSeek\nconducts imbalance-aware aggregation of all the edge scores to obtain the final\nnoticeability score. Using six real-world graphs, we empirically demonstrate\nthat HideNSeek effectively alleviates the observed limitations, and LEO (i.e.,\nour learnable edge scorer) outperforms eleven competitors in distinguishing\nattack edges under five different attack methods. For an additional\napplication, we show that LEO boost the performance of robust GNNs by removing\nattack-like edges.",

Previous infrared observations have\nreported that both objects show deep ice and dust absorption features that are\noften seen in embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) or background stars sitting\nbehind dense clouds, however, they are located neither in known star-forming\nregions nor in known dense clouds. Their infrared spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) show a peak around 5 micron, which are incompatible with existing SED\nmodels of typical embedded YSOs. The present ALMA observations have detected\ncompact emission of CO(3-2) and SiO(8-7) at the positions of the icy objects.\nThe observed large column ratios of gas-phase SiO/CO (~10^-3) in both objects,\nas well as their broad line widths (8-14 km/s), imply that they are associated\nwith shocked gas. Although a large dust extinction (Av ~100 mag) is expected\nfrom their deep dust/ice absorption, no dust continuum emission is detected,\nwhich would suggest a large beam dilution effect due to their compact source\nsizes. Their systemic velocities are clearly separated from the surrounding CO\nclouds, suggesting that they are isolated. The characteristics of their SEDs,\nthe presence of deep dust/ice absorption features, compact source size, and\nSiO-dominated broad molecular line emission, cannot easily be accounted for by\nany of known interstellar ice-absorption sources.

    "abstract": "The discovery of causal relations from observed data has attracted\nsignificant interest from disciplines such as economics, social sciences, and\nbiology. In practical applications, considerable knowledge of the underlying\nsystems is often unavailable, and real data are usually associated with\nnonlinear causal structures, which makes the direct use of most conventional\ncausality analysis methods difficult. This study proposes a novel quantum\nPeter-Clark (qPC) algorithm for causal discovery that does not require any\nassumptions about the underlying model structures. Based on conditional\nindependence tests in a class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces\ncharacterized by quantum circuits, the proposed algorithm can explore causal\nrelations from the observed data drawn from arbitrary distributions. We\nconducted systematic experiments on fundamental graphs of causal structures,\ndemonstrating that the qPC algorithm exhibits better performance, particularly\nwith smaller sample sizes compared to its classical counterpart. Furthermore,\nwe proposed a novel optimization approach based on Kernel Target Alignment\n(KTA) for determining hyperparameters of quantum kernels. This method\neffectively reduced the risk of false positives in causal discovery, enabling\nmore reliable inference. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate\nthat the quantum algorithm can empower classical algorithms for accurate\ninference in causal discovery, supporting them in regimes where classical\nalgorithms typically fail. In addition, the effectiveness of this method was\nvalidated using the datasets on Boston housing prices, heart disease, and\nbiological signaling systems as real-world applications. These findings\nhighlight the potential of quantum-based causal discovery methods in addressing\npractical challenges, particularly in small-sample scenarios, where traditional\napproaches have shown significant limitations.",

    "abstract": "3D Referring Expression Segmentation (3D-RES) aims to segment point cloud\nscenes based on a given expression. However, existing 3D-RES approaches face\ntwo major challenges: feature ambiguity and intent ambiguity. Feature ambiguity\narises from information loss or distortion during point cloud acquisition due\nto limitations such as lighting and viewpoint. Intent ambiguity refers to the\nmodel's equal treatment of all queries during the decoding process, lacking\ntop-down task-specific guidance. In this paper, we introduce an Image enhanced\nPrompt Decoding Network (IPDN), which leverages multi-view images and\ntask-driven information to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. To\naddress feature ambiguity, we propose the Multi-view Semantic Embedding (MSE)\nmodule, which injects multi-view 2D image information into the 3D scene and\ncompensates for potential spatial information loss. To tackle intent ambiguity,\nwe designed a Prompt-Aware Decoder (PAD) that guides the decoding process by\nderiving task-driven signals from the interaction between the expression and\nvisual features. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that IPDN outperforms\nthe state-ofthe-art by 1.9 and 4.2 points in mIoU metrics on the 3D-RES and\n3D-GRES tasks, respectively.",

They provide scalable memory\ncapacity using NAND flash at a much lower cost. In addition, they have\ndifferent performance characteristics for their dual byte/block interface\nrespectively, while offering essential memory semantics for upper-level\nsoftware. Such a byte-accessible storage device provides new implications on\nthe software system design.\n  In this paper, we develop a new file system, named ByteFS, by rethinking the\ndesign primitives of file systems and SSD firmware to exploit the advantages of\nboth byte and block-granular data accesses. ByteFS supports byte-granular data\npersistence to retain the persistence nature of SSDs. It extends the core data\nstructure of file systems by enabling dual byte/block-granular data accesses.\nTo facilitate the support for byte-granular writes, \\pname{} manages the\ninternal DRAM of SSD firmware in a log-structured manner and enables data\ncoalescing to reduce the unnecessary I/O traffic to flash chips. ByteFS also\nenables coordinated data caching between the host page cache and SSD cache for\nbest utilizing the precious memory resource. We implement ByteFS on both a real\nprogrammable SSD and an emulated memory-semantic SSD for sensitivity study.\nCompared to state-of-the-art file systems for non-volatile memory and\nconventional SSDs, ByteFS outperforms them by up to 2.7$\\times$, while\npreserving the essential properties of a file system.

    "abstract": "Autonomous vessels potentially enhance safety and reliability of seaborne\ntrade. To facilitate the development of autonomous vessels, high-fidelity\nsimulations are required to model realistic interactions with other vessels.\nHowever, modeling realistic interactive maritime traffic is challenging due to\nthe unstructured environment, coarsely specified traffic rules, and largely\nvarying vessel types. Currently, there is no standard for simulating\ninteractive maritime environments in order to rigorously benchmark autonomous\nvessel algorithms. In this paper, we introduce the first intelligent sailing\nmodel (ISM), which simulates rule-compliant vessels for navigation on the open\nsea. An ISM vessel reacts to other traffic participants according to maritime\ntraffic rules while at the same time solving a motion planning task\ncharacterized by waypoints. In particular, the ISM monitors the applicable\nrules, generates rule-compliant waypoints accordingly, and utilizes a model\npredictive control for tracking the waypoints. We evaluate the ISM in two\nenvironments: interactive traffic with only ISM vessels and mixed traffic where\nsome vessel trajectories are from recorded real-world maritime traffic data or\nhandcrafted for criticality. Our results show that simulations with many ISM\nvessels of different vessel types are rule-compliant and scalable. We tested\n4,049 critical traffic scenarios. For interactive traffic with ISM vessels, no\ncollisions occurred while goal-reaching rates of about 97 percent were\nachieved. We believe that our ISM can serve as a standard for challenging and\nrealistic maritime traffic simulation to accelerate autonomous vessel\ndevelopment.",

Existing methods evict tokens based on their\npositions or importance scores, but position-based strategies can miss crucial\ninformation outside predefined regions, while those relying on global\nimportance scores resulting in strong regional biases, limiting the KV cache's\noverall context retention and potentially impairing the performance of LLMs on\ncomplex tasks. Our wavelet analysis reveals that as tokens approach the end of\nsequence, their contributions to generation gradually increase and tends to\ndiverge more from neighboring tokens, indicating a smooth transition with\nincreasing complexity and variability from distant to nearby context. Motivated\nby this observation, we propose TreeKV, an intuitive, training-free method that\nemploys a tree structure for smooth cache compression. TreeKV maintains a fixed\ncache size, allowing LLMs to deliver high-quality output even in long text\nscenarios. Unlike most compression methods, TreeKV is applicable to both the\ngeneration and prefilling stages. TreeKV consistently surpasses all baseline\nmodels in language modeling tasks on PG19 and OpenWebText2, allowing LLMs\ntrained with short context window to generalize to longer window with a 16x\ncache reduction.

In an\nonline experiment, 376 participants judged the probability of each of 1,200\ngeneral-knowledge claims for which we have ground truth (451,200 ratings).\nAggregating binary judgments by majority vote already exhibits the \"wisdom of\nthe crowd\"--the superior accuracy of collective inferences relative to\nindividual inferences.

    "abstract": "In autonomous driving, traditional Computer Vision (CV) agents often struggle\nin unfamiliar situations due to biases in the training data. Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) agents address this by learning from experience and maximizing\nrewards, which helps them adapt to dynamic environments. However, ensuring\ntheir generalization remains challenging, especially with static training\nenvironments. Additionally, DRL models lack transparency, making it difficult\nto guarantee safety in all scenarios, particularly those not seen during\ntraining. To tackle these issues, we propose a method that combines DRL with\nCurriculum Learning for autonomous driving. Our approach uses a Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) agent and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn safe\ndriving in the CARLA simulator. The agent is trained using two-fold curriculum\nlearning, progressively increasing environment difficulty and incorporating a\ncollision penalty in the reward function to promote safety. This method\nimproves the agent's adaptability and reliability in complex environments, and\nunderstand the nuances of balancing multiple reward components from different\nfeedback signals in a single scalar reward function.

    "abstract": "Quantum annealing provides a promising way to solve combinational\noptimization problems where the solutions correspond to the ground state of the\nIsing Hamiltonian. We can implement quantum annealing using the Kerr non-linear\nresonators, with bifurcation phenomena emerging when subjected to a parametric\ndrive. These bifurcated states can function as bases of qubits. Moreover,\nintegrating four-body interactions between physical qubits enables the\nestablishment of effective all-to-all long-range interactions between logical\nqubits, which is essential for practical quantum annealing. While theoretical\nproposals exist for creating four-body interactions within Kerr non-linear\nresonators, there has not been experimental verification through their\nspectroscopic signatures. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the\nspectroscopic measurements of Kerr non-linear resonators featuring four-body\ninteraction. We identify six distinct frequencies exhibiting population changes\nby employing resonant driving on one resonator and weak driving on another.\nAnalytical and numerical calculations validate these findings.

To understand the true nature of the old\nGC MPs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we study the Ca--CN--CH photometry\nof the old metal-poor LMC GC NGC 2257. We find the predominantly FG-dominated\npopulational number ratio of $n$(FG):$n$(SG) = 61:39($\\pm$4), where the FG and\nSG denote the first and second generations. Both the FG and SG have similar\ncumulative radial distributions, consistent with the idea that NGC 2257 is\ndynamically old. We obtain [Fe/H] = $-$1.78$\\pm$0.00 dex($\\sigma$=0.05 dex) and\nour metallicity is $\\sim$0.2 dex larger than that from the high-resolution\nspectroscopy by other, due to their significantly lower temperatures by $\\sim$\n$-$200 K. The NGC 2257 FG shows a somewhat larger metallicity variation than\nthe SG, the first detection of such phenomenon in an old LMC GC, similar to\nGalactic GCs with MPs, strongly suggesting that it is a general characteristic\nof GCs with MPs. Interestingly, the NGC 2257 SG does not show a helium\nenhancement compared to the FG. Our results for the Galactic normal GCs exhibit\nthat the degree of carbon and nitrogen variations are tightly correlated with\nthe GC mass, while NGC 2257 exhibits slightly smaller variations for its mass.\nWe show that old LMC GCs follow the same trends as the Galactic normal GCs in\nthe $\\Delta$W$_{\\rm CF336W,F438W,F814W}$, $N_{\\rm FG}/N_{\\rm tot}$, and $\\log\nM/M_{\\rm \\odot}$ domains.

Recently, Polymer Matrix Sand\nComposites (PMSCs) have emerged as a viable cost-effective option. This ongoing\nresearch focuses on providing stronger protection against diverse ballistic\nimpacts. The study examines the enhancement of ballistic resistance in PMSCs\nthrough the graded incorporation of sand. Variable properties are achieved\nalong the thickness by altering the sand particle size and weight fraction in\nthe polymer matrix. The gradation creates a stepwise structure, starting with a\ndense base impact zone containing abrasive sand particles with a typical size\nrange. This layer is brittle and hard, effectively eroding incoming\nprojectiles. Subsequent layers are less dense, offering tensile strength that\nreflects stress waves and reduces impact energy while supporting the frontal\nbrittle zone. The minimally dense or neat matrix regions prevent backlash and\nprovide a cushioning effect. The addition of sand particles increases the\ncomposite's surface area, enhancing adhesion between inclusions and the matrix.\nThis improved adhesion ensures efficient load transfer, increasing overall\nhardness. PMSCs were fabricated to analyze the effects of two matrix\ncompositions, and refining manufacturing methods. These composites were\nsubjected to tensile testing, Izod impact testing, Shore-D hardness testing,\nand other evaluations to assess their mechanical properties. The findings show\nthat varying the sand content significantly impacts mechanical properties up to\nan optimal weight fraction for a given size range of inclusions. Experimental\nand simulation studies were employed to extract properties and evaluate\nmaterial behavior under ballistic threats. The research underscores the\npotential of PMSCs as affordable and sustainable composites for advanced\nballistic protection.",

The most recent\napproaches assume the existence of a single background source and represent the\nbackground signal using a linear dynamical system (LDS). This assumption might\nfail to capture the complexities of modern electromagnetic environments with\nmultiple sources. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a method for\ndetecting the transient signal in a background composed of an unknown number of\nemitters. The proposed method consists of two main tasks. First, a Bayesian\nnonparametric model called the infinite factorial linear dynamical system\n(IFLDS) is developed. The developed model is based on the sticky Indian buffet\nprocess and enables the representation and parameter learning of the unbounded\nnumber of background sources. This study also designs a parameter learning\nmethod for the IFLDS using slice sampling and particle Gibbs with ancestor\nsampling. Second, the finite moving average (FMA) stopping time is introduced\nto minimize the worst-case probability of missed detection, and the statistical\nperformance of the stopping time is investigated. To facilitate the computation\nof the FMA stopping time, this study derives the factorial Kalman forward\nfiltering (FKFF) method and designs a dependence structure for the underlying\nmodel, allowing the stopping time to be defined by a recursive function.\nNumerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and\nthe validity of the theoretical results.

    "abstract": "Decoding text, speech, or images from human neural signals holds promising\npotential both as neuroprosthesis for patients and as innovative communication\ntools for general users. Although neural signals contain various information on\nspeech intentions, movements, and phonetic details, generating informative\noutputs from them remains challenging, with mostly focusing on decoding short\nintentions or producing fragmented outputs. In this study, we developed a\ndiffusion model-based framework to decode visual speech intentions from\nspeech-related non-invasive brain signals, to facilitate face-to-face neural\ncommunication. We designed an experiment to consolidate various phonemes to\ntrain visemes of each phoneme, aiming to learn the representation of\ncorresponding lip formations from neural signals. By decoding visemes from both\nisolated trials and continuous sentences, we successfully reconstructed\ncoherent lip movements, effectively bridging the gap between brain signals and\ndynamic visual interfaces. The results highlight the potential of viseme\ndecoding and talking face reconstruction from human neural signals, marking a\nsignificant step toward dynamic neural communication systems and speech\nneuroprosthesis for patients.",

    "abstract": "$r$-mode oscillations in rotating neutron stars are a source of continuous\ngravitational radiation. We investigate the excitation of $r$-modes by the\nmechanical impact on the neutron star surface of stochastically accreted clumps\nof matter, assuming that the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability is not\ntriggered. The star is idealised as a slowly-rotating, unmagnetised,\none-component fluid with a barotropic equation of state in Newtonian gravity.\nIt is found that the $r$-mode amplitude depends weakly on the equation of state\nbut sensitively on the rotation frequency $\\nu_{\\rm s}$. The gravitational wave\nstrain implicitly depends on the equation of state through the damping\ntimescale. The root-mean-square strain is $h_{\\rm rms} \\approx 10^{-35}\n(\\nu_{\\rm s}/ 10 {\\rm Hz})^{2} (R_*/10 {\\rm km})^2 (\\Delta t_{\\rm acc}/1 {\\rm\nyr})^{1/2} (f_{\\rm acc}/1 {\\rm kHz})^{-1/2} (\\dot{M}/10^{-8} \\text{M}_{\\odot}\n\\text{yr}^{-1}) (v/0.4c) (d/1 {\\rm kpc})^{-1}$, which is comparable to the\nstrain from $g$-, $p$- and $f$-modes excited by stochastic accretion, where\n$R_*$ is the radius of the star, $\\Delta t_{\\rm acc}$ is the uninterrupted\nduration of an accretion episode, $f_{\\rm acc}$ is the mean clump impact\nfrequency, $\\dot{M}$ is the accretion rate, $v$ is the impact speed, and $d$ is\nthe distance of the star from the Earth. An observational test is proposed,\nbased on the temporal autocorrelation function of the gravitational wave\nsignal, to discern whether the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability\nswitches on and coexists with impact-excited $r$-modes before or during a\ngravitational wave observation.",

To test this hypothesis, a TADA system prototype was trained and\nevaluated on the task of removing electromyographic (EMG) noise from EEG data\nin the EEGdenoiseNet dataset, which includes EMG and EEG data from 67 subjects.\nThe TADA filter surpasses conventional signal filtration algorithms across\nquantitative metrics (Correlation Coefficient, Temporal RRMSE, Spectral RRMSE),\nand performs competitively against other deep learning architectures at a\nreduced model size of less than 400,000 trainable parameters.

    "abstract": "Many residential prosumers exhibit a high price-tolerance for household\nelectricity bills and a low response to price incentives. This is because the\nhousehold electricity bills are not inherently high, and the potential for\nsaving on electricity bills through participation in conventional Shared Energy\nStorage (SES) is limited, which diminishes their motivation to actively engage\nin SES. Additionally, existing SES models often require prosumers to take\nadditional actions, such as optimizing rental capacity and bidding prices,\nwhich happen to be capabilities that typical household prosumers do not\npossess. To incentivize these high price-tolerance residential prosumers to\nparticipate in SES, a novel SES aggregation framework is proposed, which does\nnot require prosumers to take additional actions and allows them to maintain\nexisting energy storage patterns. Compared to conventional long-term operation\nof SES, the proposed framework introduces an additional short-term construction\nstep during which the energy service provider (ESP) acquires control of the\nenergy storage systems (ESS) and offers electricity deposit and withdrawal\nservices (DWS) with dynamic coefficients, enabling prosumers to withdraw more\nelectricity than they deposit without additional actions. Additionally, a\nmatching mechanism is proposed to align prosumers' electricity consumption\nbehaviors with ESP's optimization strategies. Finally, the dynamic coefficients\nin DWS and trading strategies are optimized by an improved deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) algorithm. Case studies are conducted to verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed SES aggregation framework with DWS and the\nmatching mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Today's Android developers tend to include numerous features to accommodate\ndiverse user requirements, which inevitably leads to bloated apps. Yet more\noften than not, only a fraction of these features are frequently utilized by\nusers, thus a bloated app costs dearly in potential vulnerabilities, expanded\nattack surfaces, and additional resource consumption. Especially in the event\nof severe security incidents, users have the need to block vulnerable\nfunctionalities immediately. Existing works have proposed various code\ndebloating approaches for identifying and removing features of executable\ncomponents. However, they typically involve static modification of files (and,\nfor Android apps, repackaging of APKs, too), which lacks user convenience let\nalone undermining the security model of Android due to the compromising of\npublic key verification and code integrity checks. This paper introduces\n3DNDroid, a Dynamic Debloating approach targeting both DEX and Native methods\nin AnDroid apps. Using an unprivileged management app in tandem with a\ncustomized Android OS, 3DNDroid dynamically reduces unnecessary code loading\nduring app execution based on a pre-generated debloating schema from static or\ndynamic analyses. It intercepts invocations of debloated bytecode methods to\nprevent their interpretation, compilation, and execution, while zero-filling\nmemory spaces of debloated native methods during code loading. Evaluation\ndemonstrates 3DNDroid's ability to debloat 187 DEX methods and 30 native\nmethods across 55 real-world apps, removing over 10K Return-Oriented\nProgramming (ROP) gadgets. Case studies confirm its effectiveness in mitigating\nvulnerabilities, and performance assessments highlight its resource-saving\nadvantages over non-debloated apps.",

Moreover, each algorithm\nincluded two sample selections based on distinct PDF shapes; one where the PDFs\nare nearly Gaussian and another opting for the least noisy PDFs with a\npronounced peak. Our investigation identifies whether our samples detect BAO\nusing the correlation function's polynomial parameterization. Later, we\ncomputed the correlation function $\\xi_\\perp(z_p)$ by getting the bin pairs\ntransversal to each other using \\texttt{CAMB}.

In this paper, we\nidentify key limitations that prevent unlearning from serving as a\ncomprehensive solution for AI safety, particularly in managing dual-use\nknowledge in sensitive domains like cybersecurity and chemical, biological,\nradiological, and nuclear (CBRN) safety.

We provide an overview of inherent constraints and open\nproblems, including the broader side effects of unlearning dangerous knowledge,\nas well as previously unexplored tensions between unlearning and existing\nsafety mechanisms. Finally, we investigate challenges related to evaluation,\nrobustness, and the preservation of safety features during unlearning.

Instead, it\nsegments images into multiple regions with optimal coarse granularity, which\nare then reconstructed into a graph structure.

In these scenarios, unchanged pixels between changed instances are\nalso mistakenly identified as changed, causing multiple changes to be\nmistakenly viewed as one. In practical applications, this issue prevents the\naccurate quantification of the number of changes. To address this issue, we\npropose a Dense Instance Separation (DISep) method as a plug-and-play solution,\nrefining pixel features from a unified instance perspective under scene-level\nsupervision. Specifically, our DISep comprises a three-step iterative training\nprocess: 1) Instance Localization: We locate instance candidate regions for\nchanged pixels using high-pass class activation maps. 2) Instance Retrieval: We\nidentify and group these changed pixels into different instance IDs through\nconnectivity searching. Then, based on the assigned instance IDs, we extract\ncorresponding pixel-level features on a per-instance basis. 3) Instance\nSeparation: We introduce a separation loss to enforce intra-instance pixel\nconsistency in the embedding space, thereby ensuring separable instance feature\nrepresentations. The proposed DISep adds only minimal training cost and no\ninference cost. It can be seamlessly integrated to enhance existing WSCD\nmethods.

However, diffusion-based\nmodels have limitations, primarily the necessity for numerous sampling steps,\nwhich causes significantly increased latency when synthesizing high-quality\naudio samples. In this paper, we propose FLowHigh, a novel approach that\nintegrates flow matching, a highly efficient generative model, into audio\nsuper-resolution. We also explore probability paths specially tailored for\naudio super-resolution, which effectively capture high-resolution audio\ndistributions, thereby enhancing reconstruction quality. The proposed method\ngenerates high-fidelity, high-resolution audio through a single-step sampling\nprocess across various input sampling rates.

This paper investigates the performance\ngain of a CAPA-based downlink secure transmission system, where multiple\nlegitimate user terminals (LUTs) coexist with multiple eavesdroppers (Eves).\nThe system's secrecy performance is evaluated using a weighted secrecy sum-rate\n(WSSR) under a power constraint. We then propose two solutions for the secure\ncurrent pattern design. The first solution is a block coordinate descent (BCD)\noptimization method based on fractional programming, which introduces a\ncontinuous-function inversion theory corresponding to matrix inversion in the\ndiscrete domain. This approach derives a closed-form expression for the optimal\nsource current pattern. Based on this, it can be found that the optimal current\npattern is essentially a linear combination of the channel spatial responses,\nthus eliminating the need for complex integration operations during the\nalgorithm's optimization process. The second solution is a heuristic algorithm\nbased on Zero-Forcing (ZF), which constructs a zero-leakage current pattern\nusing the channel correlation matrix. It further employs a water-filling\napproach to design an optimal power allocation scheme that maximizes the WSSR.\nIn high SNR regions, this solution gradually approaches the first solution,\nensuring zero leakage while offering lower computational complexity. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that: 1) CAPA-based systems achieve better WSSR compared to\ndiscrete multiple-input multiple-output systems. 2) The proposed methods,\nwhether optimization-based or heuristic, provide significant performance\nimprovements over existing state-of-the-art Fourier-based discretization\nmethods, while considerably reducing computational complexity.",

The dental context includes the tooth prepared to receive a crown and\nits surroundings, namely the two adjacent teeth and the three closest teeth in\nthe opposing jaw. We formulate crown generation in terms of completing this\npoint cloud context. A feature extractor first converts the input point cloud\ninto a set of feature vectors that represent local regions in the point cloud.\nThe set of feature vectors is then fed into a transformer to predict a new set\nof feature vectors for the missing region (crown).

Finally, a differentiable point-to-mesh layer\nserves to reconstruct the crown surface mesh.

Only one source, PRIMER-COS 3866 at $z=4.66$, is significantly\ndetected in our radio surveys, which has been previously identified as an X-ray\nAGN. Its radio properties are consistent with both an AGN and star formation\norigin with a spectral index of $\\alpha=-0.76^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$, radio-loudness\nof $R\\approx0.5$, and brightness temperature limit of $T_b \\gtrsim 10^{3}$ K.\nOur stacking results of both spectroscopically and photometrically selected AGN\ncandidates yield non-detections in all fields, with 3$\\sigma$ limits of\n$L_{1.4\\text{GHz}} < 8.6\\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (spectroscopic sample) and\n$L_{1.3\\text{GHz}} < 1.3\\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (photometric sample). We\ndemonstrate that these results are still consistent with expectations from the\nempirical $L_X - L_{\\text{H}\\alpha}$ and $L_X - L_R$ correlations established\nfor local AGN. We argue that current radio observations in these studied fields\nhave insufficient depth to claim JWST discovered AGN candidates are radio-weak.\nWe project that future surveys carried out by the SKA and ngVLA should be able\nto obtain significant detections within a few hours, providing crucial\nmeasurements of their brightness temperature, which would allow for\ndistinguishing between AGN and starburst-driven origins of this new abundant\npopulation.",

    "abstract": "Managing the massive annual gatherings of Hajj and Umrah presents significant\nchallenges, particularly as the Saudi government aims to increase the number of\npilgrims. Currently, around two million pilgrims attend Hajj and 26 million\nattend Umrah making crowd control especially in critical areas like the Grand\nMosque during Tawaf, a major concern. Additional risks arise in managing dense\ncrowds at key sites such as Arafat where the potential for stampedes, fires and\npandemics poses serious threats to public safety. This research proposes a\nmachine learning model to classify crowd density into three levels: moderate\ncrowd, overcrowded and very dense crowd in video frames recorded during Hajj,\nwith a flashing red light to alert organizers in real-time when a very dense\ncrowd is detected. While current research efforts in processing Hajj\nsurveillance videos focus solely on using CNN to detect abnormal behaviors,\nthis research focuses more on high-risk crowds that can lead to disasters.\nHazardous crowd conditions require a robust method, as incorrect classification\ncould trigger unnecessary alerts and government intervention, while failure to\nclassify could result in disaster. The proposed model integrates Local Binary\nPattern (LBP) texture analysis, which enhances feature extraction for\ndifferentiating crowd density levels, along with edge density and area-based\nfeatures. The model was tested on the KAU-Smart Crowd 'HAJJv2' dataset which\ncontains 18 videos from various key locations during Hajj including 'Massaa',\n'Jamarat', 'Arafat' and 'Tawaf'. The model achieved an accuracy rate of 87%\nwith a 2.14% error percentage (misclassification rate), demonstrating its\nability to detect and classify various crowd conditions effectively. That\ncontributes to enhanced crowd management and safety during large-scale events\nlike Hajj.",

An increasing\nnumber of services offer LLMs for various tasks via APIs. Different LLMs\ndemonstrate expertise in different domains of queries (e.g., text\nclassification queries). Meanwhile, LLMs of different scales, complexities, and\nperformance are priced diversely. Driven by this, several researchers are\ninvestigating strategies for selecting an ensemble of LLMs, aiming to decrease\noverall usage costs while enhancing performance. However, to the best of our\nknowledge, none of the existing works addresses the problem, how to find an LLM\nensemble subject to a cost budget, which maximizes the ensemble performance\nwith guarantees.\n  In this paper, we formalize the performance of an ensemble of models (LLMs)\nusing the notion of correctness probability, which we formally define. We\ndevelop an approach for aggregating responses from multiple LLMs to enhance\nensemble performance. Building on this, we formulate the Optimal Ensemble\nSelection problem of selecting a set of LLMs subject to a cost budget that\nmaximizes the overall correctness probability. We show that the correctness\nprobability function is non-decreasing and non-submodular and provide evidence\nthat the Optimal Ensemble Selection problem is likely to be NP-hard. By\nleveraging a submodular function that upper bounds correctness probability, we\ndevelop an algorithm called ThriftLLM and prove that it achieves an\ninstance-dependent approximation guarantee with high probability. Our framework\nfunctions as a data processing system that selects appropriate LLM operators to\ndeliver high-quality results under budget constraints.",

Unlike existing\nsystems, Beyond Life operates independently of service providers, offering\nusers greater transparency and control over how their will is generated,\nstored, and executed. The system is also designed to be portable, allowing\nusers to change their will service provider. The proposed system has been fully\ndeveloped and rigorously evaluated to ensure performance and real-world\nfeasibility. The system implementation is made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Chronic itch affects 13% of the US population, is highly debilitating, and\nunderlies many medical conditions. A major challenge in clinical care and new\ntherapeutics development is the lack of an objective measure for quantifying\nitch, leading to reliance on subjective measures like patients' self-assessment\nof itch severity. In this paper, we show that a home radio device paired with\nartificial intelligence (AI) can concurrently capture scratching and evaluate\nits impact on sleep quality by analyzing radio signals bouncing in the\nenvironment. The device eliminates the need for wearable sensors or skin\ncontact, enabling monitoring of chronic itch over extended periods at home\nwithout burdening patients or interfering with their skin condition. To\nvalidate the technology, we conducted an observational clinical study of\nchronic pruritus patients, monitored at home for one month using both the radio\ndevice and an infrared camera. Comparing the output of the device to ground\ntruth data from the camera demonstrates its feasibility and accuracy (ROC AUC =\n0.997, sensitivity = 0.825, specificity = 0.997). The results reveal a\nsignificant correlation between scratching and low sleep quality, manifested as\na reduction in sleep efficiency (R = 0.6, p < 0.001) and an increase in sleep\nlatency (R = 0.68, p < 0.001). Our study underscores the potential of passive,\nlong-term, at-home monitoring of chronic scratching and its sleep implications,\noffering a valuable tool for both clinical care of chronic itch patients and\npharmaceutical clinical trials.",

Recent efforts have\ndocumented how ML enhances predictive accuracy, optimizes designs, and analyzes\ncomplex behaviors. However, one might also raise concerns about the diminishing\nrole of human intuition and the interpretability of algorithms. To showcase\nthis rarely explored front, this paper presents how ML can be successfully\nintegrated into various engineering problems by means of formulation via\ndeduction, induction, and abduction. Then, this paper identifies three\nprincipal paradoxes that could arise when adopting ML: analysis paralysis\n(increased prediction accuracy leading to a reduced understanding of physical\nmechanisms), infeasible solutions (optimization resulting in unconventional\ndesigns that challenge engineering intuition), and the Rashomon effect (where\ncontradictions in explainability methods and physics arise).
