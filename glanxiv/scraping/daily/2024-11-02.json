    "abstract": "During the Z-Pinch fusion process, electric current is injected into liquid\nmetal from the plasma column, generating Lorentz forces that deform the liquid\nmetal's free surface. Modeling this phenomenon is essential for assessing the\nfeasibility of using liquid metal as an electrode wall in fusion devices.\nTraditionally, such problems, where liquid metal is exposed to electromagnetic\nforces, are modeled using magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) formulation, which is more\nsuitable for cases without external electric current penetration into liquid\nmetals. MHD formulation typically models situations where liquid metal flows in\nthe presence of an external magnetic field, with the initial magnetic field\nknown and evolving over time via the magnetic induction equation. However, in\nZ-Pinch fusion devices, the electric current penetrates and traverses through\nthe liquid metal, necessitating numerical calculations for the initial magnetic\nfield. Additionally, the deformation of the liquid metal surface alters the\ncurrent path's geometry and the resulting magnetic field, rendering traditional\nMHD formulations unsuitable. This work addresses this issue by directly solving\nMaxwell's equations, instead of the magnetic induction equation, in combination\nwith Navier-Stokes equations, making it possible to predict the magnetic field\neven when the fluid is in motion. The Maxwell equations are solved in potential\nformulation alongside Navier-Stokes equations using a finite volume numerical\nmethod on a collocated grid arrangement. This proposed numerical framework\nsuccessfully captures the deformation of the liquid metal's free surface due to\nthe applied electric current.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the potential of WebAssembly as a more secure and\nefficient alternative to Linux containers for executing untrusted code in cloud\ncomputing with Kubernetes. Specifically, it evaluates the security and\nperformance implications of this shift. Security analyses demonstrate that both\nLinux containers and WebAssembly have attack surfaces when executing untrusted\ncode, but WebAssembly presents a reduced attack surface due to an additional\nlayer of isolation. The performance analysis further reveals that while\nWebAssembly introduces overhead, particularly in startup times, it could be\nnegligible in long-running computations. However, WebAssembly enhances the core\nprinciple of containerization, offering better security through isolation and\nplatform-agnostic portability compared to Linux containers. This research\ndemonstrates that WebAssembly is not a silver bullet for all security concerns\nor performance requirements in a Kubernetes environment, but typical attacks\nare less likely to succeed and the performance loss is relatively small.",

    "abstract": "The restricted mean survival time (RMST) has become a popular measure to\nsummarize event times in longitudinal studies. Defined as the area under the\nsurvival function up to a time horizon $\\tau$ > 0, the RMST can be interpreted\nas the life expectancy within the time interval [0, $\\tau$]. In addition to its\nstraightforward interpretation, the RMST also allows for the definition of\nvalid estimands for the causal analysis of treatment contrasts in medical\nstudies. In this work, we introduce a non-parametric approach to model the RMST\nconditional on a set of baseline variables (including, e.g., treatment\nvariables and confounders). Our method is based on a direct modeling strategy\nfor the RMST, using leave-one-out jackknife pseudo-values within a random\nforest regression framework. In this way, it can be employed to obtain precise\nestimates of both patient-specific RMST values and confounder-adjusted\ntreatment contrasts. Since our method (termed \"pseudo-value random forest\",\nPVRF) is model-free, RMST estimates are not affected by restrictive assumptions\nlike the proportional hazards assumption. Particularly, PVRF offers a high\nflexibility in detecting relevant covariate effects from higher-dimensional\ndata, thereby expanding the range of existing pseudo-value modeling techniques\nfor RMST estimation. We investigate the properties of our method using\nsimulations and illustrate its use by an application to data from the SUCCESS-A\nbreast cancer trial. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that PVRF yields\naccurate estimates of both patient-specific RMST values and RMST-based\ntreatment contrasts.",

Ensuring the\nauthentication and integrity of security-sensitive telemetry in these\napplications is vital. Digital signatures provide scalable authentication with\nnon-repudiation and public verifiability, making them essential tools for IoTs.\nHowever, emerging quantum computers necessitate post-quantum (PQ) secure\nsolutions, yet existing NIST-PQC standards are costlier than their conventional\ncounterparts and unsuitable for resource-limited IoTs. There is a significant\nneed for lightweight PQ-secure digital signatures that respect the resource\nconstraints of low-end IoTs.\n  We propose a new multiple-time hash-based signature called Maximum\nUtilization Multiple HORS (MUM-HORS) that offers PQ security, short signatures,\nfast signing, and high key utilization for an extended lifespan. MUM-HORS\naddresses the inefficiency and key loss issues of HORS in offline/online\nsettings by introducing compact key management data structures and optimized\nresistance to weak-message attacks.

The\ndiversity in IoT manufacturers, standards, and devices creates a combinatorial\nexplosion of such deployment scenarios, leading to increased security and\nsafety threats due to the difficulty of managing such heterogeneity. In almost\nevery IoT deployment, wireless gateways are crucial for interconnecting IoT\ndevices and providing services, yet they are vulnerable to external threats and\nserve as key entry points for large-scale IoT attacks. Memory-based\nvulnerabilities are among the most serious threats in software, with no\nuniversal solution yet available. Legacy memory protection mechanisms, such as\ncanaries, RELRO, NX, and Fortify, have enhanced memory safety but remain\ninsufficient for comprehensive protection. Emerging technologies like ARM-MTE,\nCHERI, and Rust are based on more universal and robust Secure-by-Design (SbD)\nmemory safety principles, yet each entails different trade-offs in hardware or\ncode modifications. Given the challenges of balancing security levels with\nassociated overheads in IoT systems, this paper explores the impact of memory\nsafety on the IoT domain through an empirical large-scale analysis of\nmemory-related vulnerabilities in modern wireless gateways.

The (rating) matrix completion is essentially a\nrating prediction process, which is also a significant problem in recommender\nsystems. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in matrix\ncompletion, which captures users' preferences over items by formulating a\nrating matrix as a bipartite graph. However, existing methods are susceptible\ndue to data sparsity and long-tail distribution in real-world scenarios.\nMoreover, the messaging mechanism of GNNs makes it difficult to capture\nhigh-order correlations and constraints between nodes, which are essentially\nuseful in recommendation tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\nMulti-Channel Hypergraph Contrastive Learning framework for matrix completion,\nnamed MHCL. Specifically, MHCL adaptively learns hypergraph structures to\ncapture high-order correlations between nodes and jointly captures local and\nglobal collaborative relationships through attention-based cross-view\naggregation. Additionally, to consider the magnitude and order information of\nratings, we treat different rating subgraphs as different channels, encourage\nalignment between adjacent ratings, and further achieve the mutual enhancement\nbetween different ratings through multi-channel cross-rating contrastive\nlearning.

We compare it with a two-stage approach that\ndetermines the capacity acquisition for all the periods up front. Using\nexpected conditional risk measures (ECRMs), we derive a tight lower bound and\nan upper bound for the gaps between the optimal objective values of risk-averse\nmultistage models and their two-stage counterparts. Based on these derived\nbounds, we present general guidelines on when to solve risk-averse two-stage or\nmultistage models.

Concretely, he proposed that for any convex body\n$C\\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+d}$, there should exist a point $\\mathbf{x} \\in\nS=C\\cap(\\mathbb{Z}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^d)$ such that for every halfspace $H$\ncontaining $\\mathbf{x}$, one has that\n  \\[\n  \\mathcal{H}_d(H\\cap S) \\geq \\frac{1}{2^n}\\frac{1}{e}\\mathcal{H}_d(S),\n  \\]\n  where $\\mathcal{H}_d$ denotes the $d$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. While\nthe conjecture remains open, Basu and Oertel proved in 2017 that the above\ninequality holds true for sufficiently large sets, in terms of a measure known\nas the \\emph{lattice width} of a set. In this work, by following a geometric\napproach, we improve this result by substantially reducing the threshold at\nwhich a set can be considered large. We reduce this threshold from an\nexponential to a polynomial dependency on the dimension, therefore\nsignificantly enlarging the family of mixed-integer convex sets over which\nOertel's conjecture holds true.",

WaKA is versatile and can be used a posteriori as a membership\ninference attack (MIA) to assess privacy risks or a priori for privacy\ninfluence measurement and data valuation. Thus, WaKA can be seen as bridging\nthe gap between data attribution and membership inference attack (MIA) by\nproviding a unified framework to distinguish between a data point's value and\nits privacy risk.

This\ncorrelation between mass and eccentricity may indicate that planet-planet\ninteractions significantly influence the warm giant planet demographics. Here\nwe conducted a detailed characterization of a warm super Jupiter, TOI-2145b.\nThis analysis utilized previous observations from TESS and Keck/HIRES, enhanced\nby new Rossiter-McLaughlin effect data from the NEID spectrometer on the 3.5 m\nWIYN Telescope. TOI-2145b is a $5.68^{+0.37}_{-0.34} M_{\\rm Jup}$ planet on a\nmoderate eccentricity ($e = 0.214^{+0.014}_{-0.014}$), 10.26-day orbit,\norbiting an evolved A-star. We constrain the projected stellar obliquity to be\n$\\lambda = 6.8^{+2.9}_{-3.8}$$^\\circ$ from two NEID observations. Our $N$-body\nsimulations suggest that the formation of super Jupiter TOI-2145b could involve\neither of two scenarios: a high initial mass or growth via collisions. On a\npopulation level, however, the collision scenario can better describe the\nmass-eccentricity distribution of observed warm Jupiters.",

    "abstract": "We consider a periodic Riesz gas consisting of $N$ classical particles on a\ncircle, interacting via a two-body repulsive potential which behaves locally as\na power law of the distance, $\\sim g/|x|^s$ for $s>-1$. Long range (LR)\ninteractions correspond to $s<1$, short range (SR) interactions to $s>1$, while\nthe cases $s=0$ and $s=2$ describe the well-known log-gas and the\nCalogero-Moser (CM) model respectively. We study the fluctuations of the\npositions around the equally spaced crystal configuration, both for Brownian\nand run-and-tumble particles (RTP). Focusing on the regime of weak noise, we\nobtain exact expressions for the space-time correlations, both at the\nmacroscopic and microscopic scale, for $N \\gg 1$ and at fixed mean density\n$\\rho$. They are characterized by a dynamical exponent $z_s=\\min(1+s,2)$. We\nalso obtain the gap statistics, described by a roughness exponent\n$\\zeta_s=\\frac{1}{2} \\min(s,1)$. For $s>0$ in the Brownian case, we find that\nin a broad time window, the mean square displacement of a particle is\nsub-diffusive as $t^{1/2}$ for SR as in single-file diffusion, and\n$t^{s/(1+s)}$ for LR interactions. Remarkably, this coincides, including the\namplitude, with a recent prediction obtained using macroscopic fluctuation\ntheory. These results also apply to RTPs beyond a time-scale $1/\\gamma$, with\n$\\gamma$ the tumbling rate, and a characteristic length-scale. Instead, for\neither shorter times or shorter distances, the active noise leads to a rich\nvariety of static and dynamical regimes, with distinct exponents. For $-1<s<0$,\nthe displacements are bounded, leading to true crystalline order at weak noise.\nThe melting transition, recently observed numerically, is discussed in light of\nour calculation. Finally, we extend our method to the active Dyson Brownian\nmotion and active CM model in a harmonic trap, generalizing to finite $\\gamma$\nthe results of our earlier work.",

Conditioning the mask generator\non ventricular volume in combination with classifier-free guidance enabled the\ncontrol of the ventricular volume distribution of the generated synthetic\nimages.

The resulting models were tested on a completely\nindependent hold-out dataset of patients with enlarged ventricles, with manual\ndelineation of the ventricles used as ground truth. The model trained on real\ndata showed a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.09 \\pm 12.18 mL in predicted\nventricular volume, while the models trained on synthetic and augmented data\nshowed MAEs of 7.52 \\pm 4.81 mL and 6.23 \\pm 4.33 mL, respectively.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a generalized theory of convolutional signal\nprocessing and neural networks for Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS).\nLeveraging the theory of algebraic signal processing (ASP), we show that any\nRKHS allows the formal definition of multiple algebraic convolutional models.\nWe show that any RKHS induces algebras whose elements determine convolutional\noperators acting on RKHS elements. This approach allows us to achieve scalable\nfiltering and learning as a byproduct of the convolutional model, and\nsimultaneously take advantage of the well-known benefits of processing\ninformation in an RKHS. To emphasize the generality and usefulness of our\napproach, we show how algebraic RKHS can be used to define convolutional signal\nmodels on groups, graphons, and traditional Euclidean signal spaces.\nFurthermore, using algebraic RKHS models, we build convolutional networks,\nformally defining the notion of pointwise nonlinearities and deriving explicit\nexpressions for the training. Such derivations are obtained in terms of the\nalgebraic representation of the RKHS. We present a set of numerical experiments\non real data in which wireless coverage is predicted from measurements captured\nby unmaned aerial vehicles. This particular real-life scenario emphasizes the\nbenefits of the convolutional RKHS models in neural networks compared to fully\nconnected and standard convolutional operators.",

To address these challenges, the paper\nrecommends educational reforms, support for local AI product development,\ninitiatives for indigenous cloud and hardware capabilities, and public-private\ncollaborations on foundational models.

    "abstract": "Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that employs a declarative\nconfiguration management approach. In Kubernetes, each desired and actual state\nis represented by an ``object'', and multiple controllers autonomously monitor\nrelated objects and update their objects towards the desired state in the\ncontrol plane. Because of this design, changes to one object propagate to other\nobjects in a chain. The cluster operators need to know the time required for\nthese cascading changes to complete, as it directly affects the quality of\nservice of applications running on the cluster. However, there is no practical\nway to observe this kind of cascading change, including breakdown of the time\ntaken by each change. Distributed tracing techniques are commonly used in the\nmicroservices architecture to monitor application performance, but they are not\ndirectly applicable to the control plane of Kubernetes; the microservices\narchitecture relies on explicitly calling APIs on other services, but in\nKubernetes the controllers just monitor objects to know when to start\nprocessing, and never call functions on other controllers directly. In this\npaper, we propose a system that automatically traces changes to objects in the\ncontrol plane. Our method adds one identifier, a Change Propagation ID (CPID),\nto the metadata of an object, and the controller that observes an object change\npropagates its CPID to the objects that the controller is updated. When\nmultiple changes need to be merged on an object, a new CPID is generated, and\nthe relationship between the original CPID and the new CPID is sent to the\nexternal trace server. We confirmed that change propagation can be visualized\nand the required time measured. We also showed that this system's overhead is\nnot significant.",

    "abstract": "Two models have recently been proposed for a description of dielectric\nspectroscopy measurements of ferroelectric nematics (NF) in thin planar\ncapacitors. The polarization-external capacitance Goldstone reorientation mode\n(PCG model) considers the NF layer between the electrodes as an effective low\nresistivity material, the resistivity being inversely proportional to the\nsquare of polarisation magnitude. The high-{\\epsilon} model considers the NF\nmaterial as having a huge permittivity due to the ease of polarisation\nrotation. In this paper we study implications of both models and show, why both\nmodels describe majority of the observed dielectric spectroscopy results\nequally well. We point out differences among the models predictions and explain\nwhy some observations can be explained only by the high-{\\epsilon} model. The\nmajor difference between the models is that the high-{\\epsilon} model predicts\nthat the increase in the cell thickness can lead to an increase in the\nfrequency range within which capacitors filled with NF material can be used for\nenergy storage while within the PCG model this frequency range reduces with\nincreasing capacitor thickness. Within both models a crucial parameter which\ndetermines the behaviour of the capacitors filled with a NF material is\nparasitic resistance, primarily due to the electrode resistance. We present\nmeasurements of electrode resistance and find that in ITO cells it is of the\norder of few hundred ohms.",

The\npurpose of this paper is to explore the response of extreme precipitation\nevents to solar activity, over Kerala, India. The three solar indices - sunspot\nnumber, F10.7 index, and cosmic ray intensity - are examined, and their\nrelationship to rainfall is examined during a 57-year period (1965 - 2021),\nstarting with Solar Cycle 20. Both solar and rainfall data are considered on an\nannual scale as well as on a seasonal scale by dividing them into winter,\npre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons. The solar indices are used to\ncalculate correlation coefficients with seasonal rainfall. Through correlation\nanalysis, it is found that the precipitation in Kerala is correlated with the\nsunspot activity, but with different significance. When solar activity is high,\nthe winter and monsoon seasons exhibit strong correlations with high\nsignificance. The solar influence at the regional level is also studied. The\ncentral and southern parts of Kerala appear to be influenced by the Sun during\nperiods of high activity. The years with excess and deficiency of rainfall are\ncalculated and compared with the solar indices. It was observed that the years\nwith excessive and insufficient rainfall coincide with the years when the solar\nactivity is at its highest or minimum. It is suggested that there is a physical\nlink and a way to predict extreme rainfall events in Kerala based on the\nassociation between solar activity and those events.",

This paper presents an approach for\nefficiently solving mixed-integer MPC motion planning problems using a hybrid\nzonotope representation of the obstacle-free space. The MPC optimization\nproblem is formulated as a multi-stage mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP)\nusing a hybrid zonotope representation of the non-convex constraints.\nRisk-aware planning is supported by assigning costs to different regions of the\nobstacle-free space within the MPC cost function. A multi-stage MIQP solver is\npresented that exploits the structure of the hybrid zonotope constraints. For\nsome hybrid zonotope representations, it is shown that the convex relaxation is\ntight, i.e., equal to the convex hull. In conjunction with logical constraints\nderived from the AV motion planning context, this property is leveraged to\ngenerate tight quadratic program (QP) sub-problems within a branch-and-bound\nmixed-integer solver. The hybrid zonotope structure is further leveraged to\nreduce the number of matrix factorizations that need to be computed within the\nQP sub-problems. Simulation studies are presented for obstacle-avoidance and\nrisk-aware motion planning problems using polytopic maps and occupancy grids.\nIn most cases, the proposed solver finds the optimal solution an order of\nmagnitude faster than a state-of-the-art commercial solver.\nProcessor-in-the-loop studies demonstrate the utility of the solver for\nreal-time implementations on embedded hardware.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the applicability of the Cloze test, a widely used tool\nfor assessing text comprehension proficiency, while highlighting its challenges\nin large-scale implementation. To address these limitations, an automated\ncorrection approach was proposed, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP)\ntechniques, particularly word embeddings (WE) models, to assess semantic\nsimilarity between expected and provided answers. Using data from Cloze tests\nadministered to students in Brazil, WE models for Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR)\nwere employed to measure the semantic similarity of the responses. The results\nwere validated through an experimental setup involving twelve judges who\nclassified the students' answers. A comparative analysis between the WE models'\nscores and the judges' evaluations revealed that GloVe was the most effective\nmodel, demonstrating the highest correlation with the judges' assessments. This\nstudy underscores the utility of WE models in evaluating semantic similarity\nand their potential to enhance large-scale Cloze test assessments. Furthermore,\nit contributes to educational assessment methodologies by offering a more\nefficient approach to evaluating reading proficiency.",

    "abstract": "The escalating sophistication of cyber-attacks and the widespread utilization\nof stealth tactics have led to significant security threats globally.\nNevertheless, the existing static detection methods exhibit limited coverage,\nand traditional dynamic monitoring approaches encounter challenges in bypassing\nevasion techniques. Thus, it has become imperative to implement nuanced and\ndynamic analysis to achieve precise behavior detection in real time. There are\ntwo pressing concerns associated with current dynamic malware behavior\ndetection solutions. Firstly, the collection and processing of data entail a\nsignificant amount of overhead, making it challenging to be employed for\nreal-time detection on the end host. Secondly, these approaches tend to treat\nmalware as a singular entity, thereby overlooking varied behaviors within one\ninstance. To fill these gaps, we propose PARIS, an adaptive trace fetching,\nlightweight, real-time malicious behavior detection system. Specifically, we\nmonitor malicious behavior with Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) and learn to\nselectively collect maliciousness-related APIs or call stacks, significantly\nreducing the data collection overhead. As a result, we can monitor a wider\nrange of APIs and detect more intricate attack behavior. We implemented a\nprototype of PARIS and evaluated the system overhead, the accuracy of\ncomparative behavior recognition, and the impact of different models and\nparameters. The result demonstrates that PARIS can reduce over 98.8% of data\ncompared to the raw ETW trace and hence decreases the overhead on the host in\nterms of memory, bandwidth, and CPU usage with a similar detection accuracy to\nthe baselines that suffer from the high overhead. Furthermore, a breakdown\nevaluation shows that 80% of the memory and bandwidth savings and a complete\nreduction in CPU usage can be attributed to our adaptive trace-fetching\ncollector.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the theory and algorithms for interacting large language\nmodel agents (LLMAs) using methods from statistical signal processing and\nmicroeconomics. While both fields are mature, their application to\ndecision-making involving interacting LLMAs remains unexplored. Motivated by\nBayesian sentiment analysis on online platforms, we construct interpretable\nmodels and algorithms that enable LLMAs to interact and perform Bayesian\ninference. Because interacting LLMAs learn from both prior decisions and\nexternal inputs, they can exhibit bias and herding behavior. Thus, developing\ninterpretable models and stochastic control algorithms is essential to\nunderstand and mitigate these behaviors. This paper has three main results.\nFirst, we show using Bayesian revealed preferences from microeconomics that an\nindividual LLMA satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions for\nrationally inattentive (bounded rationality) Bayesian utility maximization and,\ngiven an observation, the LLMA chooses an action that maximizes a regularized\nutility. Second, we utilize Bayesian social learning to construct interpretable\nmodels for LLMAs that interact sequentially with each other and the environment\nwhile performing Bayesian inference. Our proposed models capture the herding\nbehavior exhibited by interacting LLMAs. Third, we propose a stochastic control\nframework to delay herding and improve state estimation accuracy under 2\nsettings: (a) centrally controlled LLMAs (b) autonomous LLMAs with incentives.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on real datasets for hate\nspeech classification and product quality assessment, using open-source models\nlike LLaMA and closed-source models like ChatGPT. The main takeaway of this\npaper, based on empirical analysis and mathematical formalism, is that LLMAs\nact as rationally bounded Bayesian agents that exhibit social learning when\ninteracting.",

By\nintegrating a novel denoising score model, graph neural networks, and a\ntailored SDE, ProGen provides a robust solution that effectively captures\nspatiotemporal dependencies while managing uncertainty. Our extensive\nexperiments on four benchmark traffic datasets demonstrate that ProGen\noutperforms state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic models. This work\ncontributes a continuous, diffusion-based generative approach to spatiotemporal\nforecasting, paving the way for future research in probabilistic modeling and\nstochastic processes.",

Although these\nregression-as-classification frameworks can capture high-density prediction\nregions and bypass convex quantile constraints, they are restricted by\nquantization errors and the curse of dimensionality due to a constant number of\nbins per dimension.

To study their functional role in the regulation of\nspecific receptor systems, current research relies mainly on genetic tools, as\nfew pharmacological options are available. To address this issue, we designed\nand synthesised a novel lipidated phosphomimetic peptide inhibitor targeting\n$\\beta$-arrestins, called ARIP, which was developed based on the C-terminal\ntail (A343-S371) of the vasopressin V2 receptor. As the V2R sequence has been\nshown to bind $\\beta$-arrestins with high affinity and stability, we added an\nN-terminal palmitate residue to allow membrane tethering and subsequent cell\nentry. Here, using BRET2-based biosensors, we demonstrated the ability of ARIP\nto inhibit agonist-induced $\\beta$-arrestin recruitment on a series of 7TMRs\nbelonging to class A (low stable associations with arrestins) or class B (high\nstability), with efficiencies that dependent on receptor type. In addition, we\nshowed that ARIP was unable to recruit $\\beta$-arrestins to the cell membrane\nby itself, and that it did not interfere with canonical G protein signalling.\nMolecular modelling studies also revealed that ARIP binds $\\beta$-arrestins in\nthe same way as V2Rpp, the phosphorylated peptide derived from the V2R\nC-terminal domain, and that replacing the p-Ser and p-Thr residues of V2Rpp\nwith Glu residues does not alter the inhibitory activity of ARIP on\n$\\beta$-arrestin recruitment. Importantly, ARIP exerted an opioid-sparing\neffect in vivo, as intrathecal injection of ARIP potentiated the analgesic\neffect of morphine in the tail-flick nociceptive model, a behavioural response\nconsistent with $\\beta$-arrestin genetic inhibition. ARIP therefore represents\na promising pharmacological tool for investigating the fine-tuning roles of\n$\\beta$-arrestins in 7TMR-driven pathophysiological processes.",

Topological arguments show that the stable and\nunstable static spheres, which come in pairs, have opposite charges. In the\npresence of angular momentum, we first study the behaviour of massless\nparticles and find the presence of stable and unstable photon spheres in both\nneutral and charged black holes. Subsequently, we study the motion of massive\ntest particles around these black holes, and find one pair of stable and\nunstable time-like circular orbits (TCOs), such that the stable and unstable\nTCO's are disconnected in certain regions. Computing the angular velocity\n$\\Omega_{\\text{\\tiny CO}}$ of the TCOs, measured by a static observer at rest,\nshows the unusual nature of its monotonic increase with the radius of TCO, near\nthe location of stable photon sphere.

We found inconsistency between the simulation thermostat\nand its implemented heat current operator in our non-equilibrium MD results\nwhich violate law of energy conservation and suggest a need for revision. We\nrevisit the virial stress tensor expression within the calculator and\nidentified the lack of a generalised many-body heat current description in it.\nWe uncover the influence of the modified heat current formula that could alter\nthe $\\kappa_{L}$ results 29% to 64% using the equilibrium MD computational\napproach. Our work demonstrates the importance of a many-body description\nduring thermal analysis in MD simulations when MLPs are in concern. This work\nsheds light on a better understanding of the relationship between interatomic\ninteraction and its heat transport mechanism.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, black hole (BH) solutions with an integrable singularity\nhave garnered significant attention as alternatives to regular black holes\n(RBH). In these models, similarly to RBHs, an object would not undergo\nspaghettification when approaching the radial origin. Instead of the\npotentially unstable de Sitter core present in RBHs, an integrable singularity\nemerges where the Ricci scalar diverges while its volume integral remains\nfinite. However, the construction of both RBH solutions and BHs with an\nintegrable singularity typically requires the inclusion of specific forms of\nmatter in the energy-momentum tensor. We demonstrate that, from a geometric\nperspective in the absence of matter, vacuum solutions in Lovelock gravity in\n$d=2N+1$ dimensions can be represented as vacuum BHs with an integrable\nsingularity in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory for $d=5$ and in cubic gravity for\n$d=7$. Meanwhile, the vacuum solution in quartic gravity in $d=9$ is described\nas a vacuum RBH with a nontrivial hyperboloidal cross-section. For all the\naforementioned cases, we have determined the conditions that the parameters in\nthe solutions must satisfy. Remarkably, in all discussed cases, there is no\npresence of an internal horizon near a potentially unstable de Sitter core.",

Quantum algorithms such as Shor's and Grover's pose significant\nthreats to classical security methods, necessitating quantum-resistant\nalternatives. This study proposes a quantum-based approach to token obfuscation\nthat leverages superposition and multi-basis verification to enhance security\nagainst quantum adversaries. Tokens are encoded in quantum superposition\nstates, ensuring probabilistic concealment until measured. A multi-basis\nverification protocol strengthens authentication by requiring validation across\nmultiple quantum measurement bases. Additionally, a quantum decay protocol and\ntoken refresh mechanism dynamically manage the token lifecycle to prevent\nprolonged exposure and replay attacks. The model was tested through quantum\nsimulations, evaluating entropy quality, adversarial robustness, and token\nverification reliability. Experimental validation demonstrates an entropy\nquality score of 0.9996, a 0% attack success rate across five adversarial\nmodels, and a 67% false positive rate, indicating strict security constraints.\nThese findings confirm the effectiveness of quantum-based token obfuscation in\npreventing unauthorized reconstruction. The proposed approach provides a\nfoundation for post-quantum cryptographic security by integrating\nentropy-driven state transformations, dynamic token evolution, and multi-basis\nverification.

However, identifying and evaluating heterogeneous treatment\neffects pose significant challenges due to the typically unknown subgroup\nstructure. Recently, a novel approach, causal k-means clustering, has emerged\nto assess heterogeneity of treatment effect by applying the k-means algorithm\nto unknown counterfactual regression functions. In this paper, we expand upon\nthis framework by integrating hierarchical and density-based clustering\nalgorithms. We propose plug-in estimators that are simple and readily\nimplementable using off-the-shelf algorithms.

We go on to study their rate of\nconvergence, and show that under the minimal regularity conditions, the\nadditional cost of causal clustering is essentially the estimation error of the\noutcome regression functions. Our findings significantly extend the\ncapabilities of the causal clustering framework, thereby contributing to the\nprogression of methodologies for identifying homogeneous subgroups in treatment\nresponse, consequently facilitating more nuanced and targeted interventions.\nThe proposed methods also open up new avenues for clustering with generic\npseudo-outcomes.

This new model has several\nadvantages. First, while the mathematics are substantially more complicated,\nthe derivation does not include ad-hoc assumptions, and the model is internally\nconsistent. Second, the new solution connects the two realms of GHK and RED,\nwhich consider the same equations but in opposing limits, negligible or\nsubstantial surface charge density effects, respectively. Third, while the\nexpressions for the new model are complicated, the new model can be reduced to\nseveral limits, which allows for a much easier and more straightforward\nanalysis.

It is a newly\ndistributed learning technique that enables to collaboratively train a deep\nlearning model on decentralized devices, referred to as clients, without\ncompromising their data privacy. Traditional federated learning methods often\nsuffer from severe performance degradation when the data distribution among\nclients differs significantly. This becomes especially problematic in the case\nof label distribution skew, where the distribution of labels varies across\nclients. To address this, a novel method called FedEntOpt is proposed.\nFedEntOpt is designed to mitigate performance issues caused by label\ndistribution skew by maximizing the entropy of the global label distribution of\nthe selected client subset in each federated learning round. This ensures that\nthe aggregated model parameters from the clients were exhibited to data from\nall available labels, which improves the accuracy of the global model.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms by up to 6\\% in\nclassification accuracy under standard settings regardless of the model size.\nMoreover, it exhibits robust and superior performance in scenarios with low\nparticipation rates and client dropout, achieving increases in classification\naccuracy of over 30\\%. In addition, FedEntOpt offers the flexibility to be\ncombined with existing algorithms, enhancing their performance by over 40\\%.",

In this work, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end\npenetration testing benchmark using a real-world penetration testing\nenvironment to explore the capabilities of LLM-based agents in this domain. Our\nresults reveal that the agents are familiar with the framework of penetration\ntesting tasks, but they still face limitations in generating accurate commands\nand executing complete processes. Accordingly, we summarize the current\nchallenges, including the difficulty of maintaining the entire message history\nand the tendency for the agent to become stuck.\n  Based on the above insights, we propose a Penetration testing State Machine\n(PSM) that utilizes the Finite State Machine (FSM) methodology to address these\nlimitations.

We exploit effective 3D point\nproximity and model such proximity via a graph within RANSAC to guide the plane\nfitting from noisy monocular depths, followed by image-level multi-plane joint\noptimization to improve the consistency among all plane instances. We further\ndesign a simple but effective pipeline to extend this single-view solution to\nsparse-view 3D plane reconstruction. Extensive experiments on a list of\ndatasets demonstrate our superior zero-shot generalizability over baselines,\nachieving state-of-the-art plane reconstruction performance in a transferring\nsetting.

    "abstract": "This paper makes a step towards modeling the modality discrepancy in the\ncross-spectral re-identification task. Based on the Lambertain model, we\nobserve that the non-linear modality discrepancy mainly comes from diverse\nlinear transformations acting on the surface of different materials. From this\nview, we unify all data augmentation strategies for cross-spectral\nre-identification by mimicking such local linear transformations and\ncategorizing them into moderate transformation and radical transformation. By\nextending the observation, we propose a Random Linear Enhancement (RLE)\nstrategy which includes Moderate Random Linear Enhancement (MRLE) and Radical\nRandom Linear Enhancement (RRLE) to push the boundaries of both types of\ntransformation. Moderate Random Linear Enhancement is designed to provide\ndiverse image transformations that satisfy the original linear correlations\nunder constrained conditions, whereas Radical Random Linear Enhancement seeks\nto generate local linear transformations directly without relying on external\ninformation. The experimental results not only demonstrate the superiority and\neffectiveness of RLE but also confirm its great potential as a general-purpose\ndata augmentation for cross-spectral re-identification.

Recently, various new methods have been proposed to adapt closed LLMs to\nprivate data without leaking private information to third parties and/or the\nLLM provider. In this work, we analyze the privacy protection and performance\nof the four most recent methods for private adaptation of closed LLMs. By\nexamining their threat models and thoroughly comparing their performance under\ndifferent privacy levels according to differential privacy (DP), various LLM\narchitectures, and multiple datasets for classification and generation tasks,\nwe find that: (1) all the methods leak query data, i.e., the (potentially\nsensitive) user data that is queried at inference time, to the LLM provider,\n(2) three out of four methods also leak large fractions of private training\ndata to the LLM provider while the method that protects private data requires a\nlocal open LLM, (3) all the methods exhibit lower performance compared to three\nprivate gradient-based adaptation methods for local open LLMs, and (4) the\nprivate adaptation methods for closed LLMs incur higher monetary training and\nquery costs than running the alternative methods on local open LLMs. This\nyields the conclusion that, to achieve truly privacy-preserving LLM adaptations\nthat yield high performance and more privacy at lower costs, taking into\naccount current methods and models, one should use open LLMs.",

In this paper, we\npropose MTCSC, the constraint-based method for cleaning multivariate time\nseries.

Recently, Chang et al.\n(2024) formulated this problem using an integral noise representation with\ndistribution-preserving guarantees, and proposed an upsampling-based algorithm\nto compute it. However, while their mathematical formulation is advantageous,\nthe algorithm incurs a high computational cost.

    "abstract": "Radio map estimation (RME) involves spatial interpolation of radio\nmeasurements to predict metrics such as the received signal strength at\nlocations where no measurements were collected. The most popular estimators\nnowadays project the measurement locations to a regular grid and complete the\nresulting measurement tensor with a convolutional deep neural network.\nUnfortunately, these approaches suffer from poor spatial resolution and require\na great number of parameters. The first contribution of this paper addresses\nthese limitations by means of an attention-based estimator named Spatial\nTransfOrmer for Radio Map estimation (STORM). This scheme not only outperforms\nthe existing estimators, but also exhibits lower computational complexity,\ntranslation equivariance, rotation equivariance, and full spatial resolution.\nThe second contribution is an extended transformer architecture that allows\nSTORM to perform active sensing, by which the next measurement location is\nselected based on the previous measurements. This is particularly useful for\nminimization of drive tests (MDT) in cellular networks, where operators request\nuser equipment to collect measurements. Finally, STORM is extensively validated\nby experiments with one ray-tracing and two real-measurement datasets.",

CORDIC is a family of iterative algorithms that, in a\nclassical context, can approximate various trigonometric, hyperbolic, and\nelementary functions using only bit shifts and additions. Adapting CORDIC to\nthe quantum context is non-trivial, as the algorithm traditionally uses several\nnon-reversible operations. We detail a method for CORDIC which avoids such\nnon-reversible operations. We propose multiple approaches to calculate the\narcsine function reversibly with CORDIC. For n bits of precision, our method\nhas space complexity of order n qubits, a layer count in the order of n times\nlog n, and a CNOT count in the order of n squared. This primitive function is a\nrequired step for the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, is necessary for\nquantum digital-to-analog conversion, can simplify a quantum speed-up for\nMonte-Carlo methods, and has direct applications in the quantum estimation of\nShapley values.",

Recent methods usually train neural networks to overfit on\nsingle point clouds to infer signed distance functions (SDFs). However, neural\nnetworks tend to smooth local details due to the lack of ground truth signed\ndistances or normals, which limits the performance of overfitting-based methods\nin reconstruction tasks. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel method,\nnamed MultiPull, to learn multi-scale implicit fields from raw point clouds by\noptimizing accurate SDFs from coarse to fine. We achieve this by mapping 3D\nquery points into a set of frequency features, which makes it possible to\nleverage multi-level features during optimization. Meanwhile, we introduce\noptimization constraints from the perspective of spatial distance and normal\nconsistency, which play a key role in point cloud reconstruction based on\nmulti-scale optimization strategies. Our experiments on widely used object and\nscene benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods in surface reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Feature Selection techniques aim at finding a relevant subset of features\nthat perform equally or better than the original set of features at explaining\nthe behavior of data. Typically, features are extracted from feature ranking or\nsubset selection techniques, and the performance is measured by classification\nor regression tasks. However, while selected features may not have equal\nimportance for the task, they do have equal importance for each class. This\nwork first introduces a comprehensive review of the concept of class-specific,\nwith a focus on feature selection and classification. The fundamental idea of\nthe class-specific concept resides in the understanding that the significance\nof each feature can vary from one class to another. This contrasts with the\ntraditional class-independent approach, which evaluates the importance of\nattributes collectively for all classes. For example, in tumor prediction\nscenarios, each type of tumor may be associated with a distinct subset of\nrelevant features. These features possess significant discriminatory power,\nenabling the differentiation of one tumor type from others. This class-specific\nperspective offers a more effective approach to classification tasks by\nrecognizing and leveraging the unique characteristics of each class. Secondly,\nclassification schemes from one-versus-all and one-versus-each strategies are\ndescribed, and a novel deep one-versus-each strategy is introduced, which\noffers advantages from the point of view of explainability (feature selection)\nand decomposability (classification). Thirdly, a novel class-specific relevance\nmatrix is presented, from which some more sophisticated classification schemes\ncan be derived, such as the three-layer class-specific scheme. The potential\nfor further advancements is wide and will open new horizons for exploring novel\nresearch directions in multiclass hyperdimensional contexts.",

This paper presents the Explainable Class-Specific Naive\nBayes (XNB) classifier, which introduces two critical innovations: 1) the use\nof Kernel Density Estimation to calculate posterior probabilities, allowing for\na more accurate and flexible estimation process, and 2) the selection of\nclass-specific feature subsets, ensuring that only the most relevant variables\nfor each class are utilized. Extensive empirical analysis on high-dimensional\ngenomic datasets shows that XNB matches the classification performance of\ntraditional Naive Bayes while drastically improving model interpretability.

    "abstract": "The relation between dynamics and structure in systems of bidisperse 2D hard\ndisks with apparent arrested dynamics is considered using numerical simulations\nand Voronoi analysis. Surprisingly, the suspensions systematically appear to\nfall out of equilibrium at an area fraction of {\\phi} {\\approx} 0.777 over a\nwide range of disk-size ratios. This is in close agreement with the\nexperimental findings of [Lozano et al., Nat. Mater. 18, 1118 (2019)] for a\nsingle large-to-small size ratio of {\\approx} 1.4. Even inside the crystalline\nregion of the state diagram there are weak structural signatures present for\nthis area fraction. Adopting a granocentric viewpoint, this allows for the\nidentification of a geometric feature - a floret pentagonal tiling - that could\nunderlie the observations. That is, this tiling has an area fraction of {\\phi}\n{\\approx} 0.777343, which closely matches the apparent 'glass transition' value\nof {\\phi}. The connection suggests that a zero-entropy, ground-state tiling can\ninfluence the dynamics of the system at finite temperature, in a manner that\nmay be similar to the way in which geometry in foam-like tissue models induces\na jamming transition. A geometric ground-state argument also appears to explain\nthe change in local dynamics observed by [Li et al., Nature 587, 225 (2020)],\nwhen a honeycomb lattice is used as the reference. Combined these findings\nchange how to view high-{\\phi} 2D fluids, namely as being influenced by the\npresence of zero-entropy geometric ground states. The proposed connection leads\nto an unexpected (dynamic) transition in the finite-temperature system, which\ncan be mistaken for a(n onset) glass transition, but is in a class of its own.\nThere is also a tentative connection to random loose packing for frictional\nsystems. An outlook is provided on how this concept may be extended to\nsoft-particle systems and into higher dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Context. The influence of magnetic fields on stellar evolution remains\nunresolved. It has been proposed that if there is a large-scale magnetic field\nin the stellar interior, torsional waves could arise, efficiently transporting\nangular momentum. In fact, the observed variations in the rotation periods of\nsome magnetic stars may be attributed to these torsional waves' standing waves.\nAims. To demonstrate the existence of torsional waves through modeling of the\nrotational period variations. Method. We conduct an eigenmode analysis of\nstanding waves based on one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations. The\ninternal magnetic field structures are parametrically represented to treat\npoloidal fields with different degrees of central/surface concentration. The\nobtained frequencies are compared with the observed frequencies of the\nrotational period variations, thereby constraining the internal magnetic field\nstructures. Results. The 67.6 years exhibited by CU Vir is reproduced for\nsurface-concentrated magnetic field structures. The rotational period\nvariations of all ten magnetic stars analyzed in this study are inconsistent\nwith a centrally concentrated magnetic field. Conclusions. Torsional waves can\nreproduce the observations of rotational period variations. The large-scale\nmagnetic fields within magnetic stars would be concentrated on the surface.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent hierarchical reinforcement learning (MAHRL) has been studied as\nan effective means to solve intelligent decision problems in complex and\nlarge-scale environments. However, most current MAHRL algorithms follow the\ntraditional way of using reward functions in reinforcement learning, which\nlimits their use to a single task. This study aims to design a multi-agent\ncooperative algorithm with logic reward shaping (LRS), which uses a more\nflexible way of setting the rewards, allowing for the effective completion of\nmulti-tasks. LRS uses Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to express the internal logic\nrelation of subtasks within a complex task. Then, it evaluates whether the\nsubformulae of the LTL expressions are satisfied based on a designed reward\nstructure. This helps agents to learn to effectively complete tasks by adhering\nto the LTL expressions, thus enhancing the interpretability and credibility of\ntheir decisions. To enhance coordination and cooperation among multiple agents,\na value iteration technique is designed to evaluate the actions taken by each\nagent. Based on this evaluation, a reward function is shaped for coordination,\nwhich enables each agent to evaluate its status and complete the remaining\nsubtasks through experiential learning. Experiments have been conducted on\nvarious types of tasks in the Minecraft-like environment. The results\ndemonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve the performance of\nmulti-agents when learning to complete multi-tasks.",

Their variability, combined with well-defined\nrelationships between pulsation properties and intrinsic evolutionary\nparameters such as luminosity, mass, and age, makes them essential for\nunderstanding galactic evolution and retrieving star formation histories.\nTherefore, accurate modeling of pulsating stars is crucial for using them as\nstandard candles and stellar population tracers.

We assess the impact of this\nupdate on pulsation properties, such as periods, instability strip topology,\nand light curve shapes, as well as on Period Wesenheit and Period-Luminosity\nrelations for Classical Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars, comparing the results with\nthose derived using older opacity data. Our results indicate that the opacity\nupdate introduces only minor changes: instability strip boundary locations\nshift by no more than $100K$ in effective temperature, and pulsation periods\nvary within $1\\sigma$ compared to previous evaluations. Light curves exhibit\nslight differences in shape and amplitude. Consequently, the theoretical\ncalibration of the Cepheid or RRL-based extragalactic distance scale remains\nlargely unaffected by the opacity changes.

They encode each user/item and its subgraph into a single super\nvector by combining graph embeddings after each graph convolution. However,\neach hop of the neighbor in the user-item subgraphs carries a specific semantic\nmeaning. Encoding all subgraph information into single vectors and inferring\nuser-item relations with dot products can weaken the semantic information\nbetween user and item subgraphs, thus leaving untapped potential.

To this end, we propose the Graph\nCross-correlated Network for Recommendation (GCR), which serves as a general\nrecommendation paradigm that explicitly considers correlations between\nuser/item subgraphs. GCR first introduces the Plain Graph Representation (PGR)\nto extract information directly from each hop of neighbors into corresponding\nPGR vectors.

HDI\nis a composite measure of life expectancy, education, and income, reflecting\noverall human development. Data was gathered from official government sources\nand international databases, including the World Bank and UNDP, covering the\nperiod from 1996 to 2022. Using the Edit Distance on Real sequence (EDR) method\nfor feature selection, the model analyzed key indicators to predict HDI values\nover the next five years (2023-2027). The model demonstrated strong predictive\naccuracy for in-sample data, but minor overfitting issues were observed with\nout-of-sample predictions, particularly in the case of the UAE. The forecast\nresults suggest that Kuwait, Bahrain, and the UAE will see stable or slightly\nincreasing HDI values, while Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman are likely to\nexperience minimal fluctuations or slight decreases. This study highlights the\nimportance of economic, health, and educational indicators in determining HDI\ntrends and emphasizes the need for region-specific predictive models to improve\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "The Entropic Associative Memory holds objects in a 2D relation or ``memory\nplane'' using a finite table as the medium. Memory objects are stored by\nreinforcing simultaneously the cells used by the cue, implementing a form of\nHebb's learning rule. Stored objects are ``overlapped'' on the medium, hence\nthe memory is indeterminate and has an entropy value at each state. The\nretrieval operation constructs an object from the cue and such indeterminate\ncontent. In this paper we present the extension to the hetero-associative case\nin which these properties are preserved. Pairs of hetero-associated objects,\npossibly of different domain and/or modalities, are held in a 4D relation. The\nmemory retrieval operation selects a largely indeterminate 2D memory plane that\nis specific to the input cue; however, there is no cue left to retrieve an\nobject from such latter plane. We propose three incremental methods to address\nsuch missing cue problem, which we call random, sample and test, and search and\ntest. The model is assessed with composite recollections consisting of\nmanuscripts digits and letters selected from the MNIST and the EMNIST corpora,\nrespectively, such that cue digits retrieve their associated letters and vice\nversa.

In this work, we\nanalytically investigate a central-spin QB model in which $N_b$ spin-1/2\nbattery cells interact with $N_c$ spin-1/2 charger units, using $m$ initially\nexcited charger units as a resource. By employing the invariant subspace method\nand the shifted Holstein-Primakoff transformation, we identify four scenarios\nin which optimal energy storage can be achieved: (i) $N_b\\!\\ll\\!m\\!\\ll\\!N_c$;\n(ii) $m\\!\\ll\\!N_b\\!\\ll\\!N_c$; (iii) $m\\!\\ll\\!N_c\\!\\ll\\!N_b$; and (iv)\n$N_b\\!\\ll\\!m\\!=\\!kN_c$ [$k\\!\\in\\!(0,1)$]. In these cases, optimal storage is\nensured by the SU(2) symmetry emerging from the charging dynamics.

Due to the\nlimited data in incremental sessions, models are prone to overfitting new\nclasses and suffering catastrophic forgetting of base classes. To tackle these\nissues, recent advancements resort to prototype-based approaches to constrain\nthe base class distribution and learn discriminative representations of new\nclasses. Despite the progress, the limited data issue still induces ill-divided\nfeature space, leading the model to confuse the new class with old classes or\nfail to facilitate good separation among new classes. In this paper, we aim to\nmitigate these issues by directly constraining the span of each class\ndistribution from a covariance perspective. In detail, we propose a simple yet\neffective covariance constraint loss to force the model to learn each class\ndistribution with the same covariance matrix. In addition, we propose a\nperturbation approach to perturb the few-shot training samples in the feature\nspace, which encourages the samples to be away from the weighted distribution\nof other classes. Regarding perturbed samples as new class data, the classifier\nis forced to establish explicit boundaries between each new class and the\nexisting ones. Our approach is easy to integrate into existing FSCIL approaches\nto boost performance. Experiments on three benchmarks validate the\neffectiveness of our approach, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance of\nFSCIL.",

In this\nwork, we focus on the text rendering aspect of these models, which provides a\nlens for evaluating a generative model's fine-grained instruction-following\ncapabilities. To this end, we introduce a new evaluation framework called\nTypeScore to sensitively assess a model's ability to generate images with\nhigh-fidelity embedded text by following precise instructions.

Based on the learned\nbi-level graphs, our model then employs a multi-relational graph network that\nconsiders both POI- and prototype-level neighbors, resulting in improved POI\nrepresentations. Our bi-level structure learning scheme is more robust to data\nnoise and incompleteness, and improves the exploration ability for\nrecommendation by alleviating sparsity issues.

    "abstract": "Zero-shot coordination problem in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),\nwhich requires agents to adapt to unseen agents, has attracted increasing\nattention. Traditional approaches often rely on the Self-Play (SP) framework to\ngenerate a diverse set of policies in a policy pool, which serves to improve\nthe generalization capability of the final agent. However, these frameworks may\nstruggle to capture the full spectrum of potential strategies, especially in\nreal-world scenarios that demand agents balance cooperation with competition.\nIn such settings, agents need strategies that can adapt to varying and often\nconflicting goals. Drawing inspiration from Social Value Orientation\n(SVO)-where individuals maintain stable value orientations during interactions\nwith others-we propose a novel framework called \\emph{Role Play} (RP). RP\nemploys role embeddings to transform the challenge of policy diversity into a\nmore manageable diversity of roles. It trains a common policy with role\nembedding observations and employs a role predictor to estimate the joint role\nembeddings of other agents, helping the learning agent adapt to its assigned\nrole. We theoretically prove that an approximate optimal policy can be achieved\nby optimizing the expected cumulative reward relative to an approximate\nrole-based policy. Experimental results in both cooperative (Overcooked) and\nmixed-motive games (Harvest, CleanUp) reveal that RP consistently outperforms\nstrong baselines when interacting with unseen agents, highlighting its\nrobustness and adaptability in complex environments.",

We investigated the heliospheric propagation of 15 Earth-impacting\nCMEs observed during April 2010 to August 2018 in the field of view (FOV) of\nthe Heliospheric Imager (HI) onboard the STEREO. About half of the 15 events\nfollowed self-similar expansion up to 40 $R_\\odot$. The remaining events showed\ndeflection either in latitude, longitude, or a tilt change. Only two events\nshowed significant rotation in the HI1 FOV. We also use toroidal and\ncylindrical flux rope fitting on the in situ observations of interplanetary\nmagnetic field (IMF) and solar wind parameters to estimate the tilt at L1 for\nthese two events. Although the sample size is small, this study suggests that\nCME rotation is not very common in the heliosphere. We attributed the observed\ndeflections and rotations of CMEs to a combination of factors, including their\ninteraction with the ambient solar wind and the influence of the ambient\nmagnetic field. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex\ndynamics involved in CME propagation and highlight the need for comprehensive\nmodeling and observational studies to improve space weather prediction.

Simply explaining this by\nsaying that the cortex has many neurons, numerous neural connections, and\ncomplex electrochemical activity between them is not sufficient to answer these\nfundamental questions. We need to uncover the theory hidden behind these\nphenomena.In essence, a neural network is equivalent to a very large directed\ngraph, with a massive number of nodes and directed connections.

The electronic\nband structure is calculated by solving the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with a\n$\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian, and the electric screening induced by\nelectron-electron interaction is evaluated under a standard random phase\napproximation approach. In particular, the longitudinal and transverse or Hall\nmobilities are calculated by using a momentum-balance equation derived from a\nsemi-classical Boltzmann equation, where the electron-impurity interaction is\nconsidered as the principal scattering center at low temperature. The obtained\nresults show that the RSOC can induce the in-plane spin components for\nspin-split subbands in different valleys, while the exchange interaction can\nlift the energy degeneracy for electrons in different valleys. The opposite\nsigns of Berry curvatures in the two valleys would introduce opposite\ndirections of Lorentz force on valley electrons. As a result, the transverse\ncurrents from nondegenerate valleys can no longer be canceled out so that the\ntransverse current or Hall mobility can be observed. Interestingly, we find\nthat at a fixed effective Zeeman field, the lowest spin-split conduction\nsubband in ML-TMDs can be tuned from one in the $K'$-valley to one in the\n$K$-valley by varying the Rashba parameter. The occupation of electrons in\ndifferent valleys also varies with changing carrier density. Therefore, we can\nchange the magnitude and direction of the Hall current by varying the Rashba\nparameter, effective Zeeman field, and carrier density by, e.g., the presence\nof a ferromagnetic substrate and/or applying a gate voltage.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have enabled researchers to explore tasks at\nthe intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, such as\nimage captioning, visual question answering, visual dialogue, and visual\nlanguage navigation. Taking inspiration from image captioning, the task of\nradiology report generation aims at automatically generating radiology reports\nby having a comprehensive understanding of medical images. However,\nautomatically generating radiology reports from medical images is a challenging\ntask due to the complexity, diversity, and nature of medical images. In this\npaper, we outline the design of a robust radiology report generation system by\nintegrating different modules and highlighting best practices drawing upon\nlessons from our past work and also from relevant studies in the literature. We\nalso discuss the impact of integrating different components to form a single\nintegrated system. We believe that these best practices, when implemented,\ncould improve automatic radiology report generation, augment radiologists in\ndecision making, and expedite diagnostic workflow, in turn improve healthcare\nand save human lives.",

The limiting mass for\nquark stars essentially depends on rotational frequency apart from bag constant\nand other fundamental parameters. The analytical results obtained agree with\nthe results of several relevant numerical estimates as well as observational\nevidence. Primordial black hole (PBH) is another hypothetical candidate of\ncompact astrophysical objects. We explore the combined effect of PBH\nevaporation and the baryon-dark matter (DM) interaction in the 21cm scenario.\nWe address both upper and lower bounds on several PBH and DM parameters using\nthe observational excess (-500^{+200}_{-500} mK) of EDGES's experimental\nresults. A similar investigation has been carried out in the framework of\ninteracting dark energy (IDE) models. We consider three IDE models and\neventually measure the allowed limits of IDE coupling parameters for individual\ncases. Keeping in view of the 21cm scenario, we also explore the multimessenger\nsignals from possible rare decay of fundamental Heavy Dark Matters (HDM). HDM\ncan undergo QCD cascade decay to produce leptons or $\\gamma$ as end products.\nOne of the multimessenger signals could be the source of ultra high energy\nneutrino ($\\sim$PeV) signals at the IceCube detector whereas the other signal\nattributes to the cooling/heating of the baryons due to HDM decay and\ncorresponding influences in the global 21cm signal. The consequence of late\ntime decay of such HDMs may also have significant implications on the aspect of\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry. The mass and lifetime of such Dark Matter\nparticles have been obtained by performing a $\\chi^2$ analysis with the PeV\nneutrino data of IceCube and finally, the amount of baryon asymmetry produced\nin the Universe is estimated if caused by Dark Matter decay.",

The superconducting critical temperatures (T$_c$) in both\nTa$_2$PdS$_6$ and Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$ initially decrease with increasing pressure.\nSubsequently, the Tcs tend to enhance drastically above 100 GPa. Notably, the\nmaximum T$_c$ in Ta$_2$PdS$_6$ is 11.2 K at 130.0 GPa, which is a relatively\nhigh record among the TMCs.

Recent advancements approach this through sequence\nmodeling, leveraging the Transformer architecture's scalability and the\nbenefits of parameter sharing to exploit task similarities. However, variations\nin task content and complexity pose significant challenges in policy\nformulation, necessitating judicious parameter sharing and management of\nconflicting gradients for optimal policy performance. Furthermore, identifying\nthe optimal parameter subspace for each task often necessitates prior knowledge\nof the task identifier during inference, limiting applicability in real-world\nscenarios with variable task content and unknown current tasks. In this work,\nwe introduce the Harmony Multi-Task Decision Transformer (HarmoDT), a novel\nsolution designed to identify an optimal harmony subspace of parameters for\neach task. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem within a\nmeta-learning framework, where the upper level learns masks to define the\nharmony subspace, while the inner level focuses on updating parameters to\nimprove the overall performance of the unified policy. To eliminate the need\nfor task identifiers, we further design a group-wise variant (G-HarmoDT) that\nclusters tasks into coherent groups based on gradient information, and utilizes\na gating network to determine task identifiers during inference. Empirical\nevaluations across various benchmarks highlight the superiority of our\napproach, demonstrating its effectiveness in the multi-task context with\nspecific improvements of 8% gain in task-provided settings, 5% in task-agnostic\nsettings, and 10% in unseen settings.",

    "abstract": "End-to-end visual information extraction (VIE) aims at integrating the\nhierarchical subtasks of VIE, including text spotting, word grouping, and\nentity labeling, into a unified framework. Dealing with the gaps among the\nthree subtasks plays a pivotal role in designing an effective VIE model.\nOCR-dependent methods heavily rely on offline OCR engines and inevitably suffer\nfrom OCR errors, while OCR-free methods, particularly those employing a\nblack-box model, might produce outputs that lack interpretability or contain\nhallucinated content. Inspired by CenterNet, DeepSolo, and ESP, we propose HIP,\nwhich models entities as HIerarchical Points to better conform to the\nhierarchical nature of the end-to-end VIE task. Specifically, such hierarchical\npoints can be flexibly encoded and subsequently decoded into desired text\ntranscripts, centers of various regions, and categories of entities.\nFurthermore, we devise corresponding hierarchical pre-training strategies,\ncategorized as image reconstruction, layout learning, and language enhancement,\nto reinforce the cross-modality representation of the hierarchical encoders.\nQuantitative experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that HIP outperforms\nprevious state-of-the-art methods, while qualitative results show its excellent\ninterpretability.",

We\nfocus on the boundary condition (BC) treatment within the existing\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) models and aim to mitigate the\n\"out-of-sample\" errors observed near complex coastal regions without developing\nnew, complex network architectures. Our approach leverages two established\nstrategies for placing BCs in CNN models, namely zero and replicate padding.\nOffline evaluations revealed that these padding strategies significantly reduce\nroot mean squared error (RMSE) in coastal regions by limiting the dependence on\nrandom initialization of weights and restricting the range of out-of-sample\npredictions. Further online evaluations suggest that replicate padding\nconsistently reduces boundary artifacts across various retrained CNN models. In\ncontrast, zero padding sometimes intensifies artifacts in certain retrained\nmodels despite both strategies performing similarly in offline evaluations.\nThis study underscores the need for BC treatments in CNN models trained on open\nwater data when predicting near-coastal subgrid forces in ML parameterizations.\nThe application of replicate padding, in particular, offers a robust strategy\nto minimize the propagation of extreme values that can contaminate\ncomputational models or cause simulations to fail. Our findings provide\ninsights for enhancing the accuracy and stability of ML parameterizations in\nthe online implementation of ocean circulation models with coastlines.",

Numerous spatiotemporal correlations and\nirregularities pose substantial challenges to this endeavor. Existing methods\ncommonly employ fixed-time granularities and sequence prediction models.\nHowever, determining appropriate time granularities is difficult, leading to\ninaccurate predictions for specific time windows. For example, users might ask:\nWhat are the crime hotspots during 12:00-20:00? To address this issue, we\nintroduce FlexiCrime, a novel event-centric framework for predicting crime\nhotspots with flexible time intervals. FlexiCrime incorporates a\ncontinuous-time attention network to capture correlations between crime events,\nwhich learns crime context features, representing general crime patterns across\ntime points and locations. Furthermore, we introduce a type-aware\nspatiotemporal point process that learns crime-evolving features, measuring the\nrisk of specific crime types at a given time and location by considering the\nfrequency of past crime events. The crime context and evolving features\ntogether allow us to predict whether an urban area is a crime hotspot given a\nfuture time interval. To evaluate FlexiCrime's effectiveness, we conducted\nexperiments using real-world datasets from two cities, covering twelve crime\ntypes. The results show that our model outperforms baseline techniques in\npredicting crime hotspots over flexible time intervals.",

Cloud\nvendors must isolate each user's resources from others to prevent them from\nattacking other users or the whole system. Users may want to move their\napplications to different environments, for instance other cloud, on-premise\nservers, or edge devices. Virtual machines (VMs) and containers are widely used\nto achieve these requirements. However, there are two problems with combined\nuse of VMs and containers. First, container images depend on host operating\nsystems and CPU architectures. Users need to manage different container images\nfor each platform to run the same codes on different OSes and ISAs. Second,\nperformance is degraded by the overheads of both VMs and containers. Previous\nresearches have solved each of these problems separately, but no solution\nsolves both problems simultaneously. Therefore, execution environments of\napplications on cloud are required to be more lightweight and portable while\nensuring isolation is required. We propose a new system that combines\nWebAssembly (Wasm) and unikernels. Wasm is a portable binary format, so it can\nbe run on any host operating systems and architectures. Unikernels are kernels\nstatically linked with applications, which reduces the overhead of guest\nkernel. In this approach, users deploy applications as a Wasm binary and it\nruns as a unikernel on cloud. To realize this system, we propose a mechanism to\nconvert a Wasm binary into a unikernel image with the Wasm AoT-compiled to\nnative code. We developed a unikernel with Wasm System Interface (WASI) API and\nan Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compiler that converts Wasm to native code. We evaluated\nthe performance of the system by running a simple HTTP server compiled into\nWasm and native code. The performance was improved by 30\\% compared to running\nit with an existing Wasm runtime on Linux on a virtual machine.",

Despite\ntheir success in modeling single-modality data marginal distribution, there is\nan under-exploration in the mutual reliance between different modalities to\ndescribe complex driving scenes. To fill in this gap, we propose a novel\nframework, X-DRIVE, to model the joint distribution of point clouds and\nmulti-view images via a dual-branch latent diffusion model architecture.\nConsidering the distinct geometrical spaces of the two modalities, X-DRIVE\nconditions the synthesis of each modality on the corresponding local regions\nfrom the other modality, ensuring better alignment and realism. To further\nhandle the spatial ambiguity during denoising, we design the cross-modality\ncondition module based on epipolar lines to adaptively learn the cross-modality\nlocal correspondence. Besides, X-DRIVE allows for controllable generation\nthrough multi-level input conditions, including text, bounding box, image, and\npoint clouds. Extensive results demonstrate the high-fidelity synthetic results\nof X-DRIVE for both point clouds and multi-view images, adhering to input\nconditions while ensuring reliable cross-modality consistency.

In addition to\nhedging, pricing these notes, particularly when multiple underlying assets are\ninvolved, adds another layer of complexity. Pricing autocallable notes involves\nintricate considerations of various risk factors, including underlying assets,\ninterest rates, and volatility. Traditional pricing methods, such as\nsample-based Monte Carlo simulations, are often time-consuming and impractical\nfor long maturities, particularly when there are multiple underlying assets. In\nthis paper, we explore autocallable structured notes with three underlying\nassets and proposes a machine learning-based pricing method that significantly\nimproves efficiency, computing prices 250 times faster than traditional Monte\nCarlo simulation based method. Additionally, we introduce a Distributional\nReinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to hedge a portfolio containing an\nautocallable structured note. Our distributional RL based hedging strategy\nprovides better PnL compared to traditional Delta-neutral and Delta-Gamma\nneutral hedging strategies. The VaR 5% (PnL value) of our RL agent based\nhedging is 33.95, significantly outperforming both the Delta neutral strategy,\nwhich has a VaR 5% of -0.04, and the Delta-Gamma neutral strategy, which has a\nVaR 5% of 13.05.

The proposed\nmethod is applicable to demonstration trajectories belonging to different\nmanifolds and types (e.g., closed and self-intersecting trajectories), and the\nclosed-loop control system is always guaranteed to be passive in different\ncases. For controllers tracking the general DS, the passivity of the system\nneeds to be guaranteed by the energy tank.

We propose a novel ``Relax and Merge''\nframework that returns a $(1+4\\rho + O(\\epsilon))$-approximate solution, where\n$\\rho$ is the approximate ratio of an off-the-shelf vanilla $k$-means algorithm\nand $O(\\epsilon)$ can be an arbitrarily small positive number.

Prestressed\nUHPC members, however, often fail quickly after crack localization accompanied\nby reinforcement rupture, which shows limited failure warnings (i.e.,\nrelatively small ductility, nearly invisible cracking, and negligible\ncompressive damage). On the other hand, UHPC members can also be designed to\nallow the gradual strain hardening of reinforcement to compensate for the load\nloss due to crack localization, and the final failure is attributed to gradual\ncrushing of UHPC prior to reinforcement rupture. Failure after gradual strain\nhardening is desirable since it brings warning signs through high ductility,\nvisible cracks, and controlled spalling. To achieve a resilient structural\ndesign of UHPC members, this study aims to develop design methods to avoid\nearly failure after crack localization and promote failure after gradual strain\nhardening. This study first establishes a three-dimensional finite-element\nanalysis (FEA) model to simulate the flexural behavior of prestressed UHPC\nbeams, which is validated against seven existing experimental beams. Then,\nparametric analyses are conducted to assess the influence of five key aspects,\nincluding the steel rebar-to-prestressing strand ratio, the post-yield\nhardening of mild steel rebars, the pretensioned stress of prestressing\nstrands, the tensile behavior of UHPC, and the web width to bottom flange\nratio. Additionally, the authors propose a design method to predict the failure\nmode of prestressed UHPC beams, which can be used to guide the design of\nreinforcement configuration and to promote ductile structural behavior.",

The covariance is the central object for uncertainty\nquantification, as it encodes the variability of the posterior distribution and\nthus the uncertainty in the posterior mean estimate. Using the Feldman-Hajek\ntheorem, we analyse the prior-to-posterior update and its low-rank\napproximation for infinite-dimensional Hilbert parameter spaces and\nfinite-dimensional observations. We show that the posterior distribution\ndiffers from the prior on a finite-dimensional subspace, and construct low-rank\napproximations to the posterior covariance, while keeping the mean fixed. Since\nin infinite dimensions, not all low-rank covariance approximations yield\napproximate posterior distributions which are equivalent to the posterior and\nprior distribution, we characterise the low-rank covariance approximations\nwhich do yield this equivalence, and their respective inverses, or\n`precisions'. For such approximations, a family of measure approximation\nproblems is solved by identifying the low-rank approximations which are optimal\nfor various losses simultaneously.

    "abstract": "Recent trends in lower precision, e.g. half-precision floating point,\ntraining have shown improved system performance and reduced memory usage for\nDeep Learning while maintaining accuracy. However, current GNN systems cannot\nachieve such goals for GNN, as our analyses show that they massively\nunderperform while showing abnormal accuracy when using half-precision. These\nsystems suffer from value overflow issues due to lowered precision,\nunder-utilization of hardware resources, and poor training performance. To\nmitigate this, we introduce HalfGNN, a half-precision based GNN system. HalfGNN\nproposes novel techniques: new vector operations for half-precision data types\nthat improve data load and reduction performance, and discretized SpMM that\novercomes the value overflow and natively provides workload balancing. Such\ntechniques improve hardware utilization, reduce memory usage, and remove atomic\nwrites. Evaluations show that HalfGNN achieves on average of 2.30X speedup in\ntraining time over DGL (float-based) for GAT, GCN, and GIN respectively while\nachieving similar accuracy, and saving 2.67X memory.",

In this paper, we propose a high\nSBP phase characterization technique using Fourier ptychographic microscopy\n(FPM), enabling a high spatial resolution and wide field of view\nsimultaneously. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this\ntechnique, we achieve a high SBP (4.91 megapixels) measurement and\ncharacterization for focusing and focusing vortex metalenses, quantitatively\ndisplaying the effect of fabrication error on their typical optical\nperformance. Furthermore, we characterize the aberration type and amount of\nwavefront deviations caused by fabrication. We also analyze compensation\nmethods for different aberrations based on the wavefront characterization\nresults, providing a targeted alignment strategy for optimizing overall optical\nsystem performance.

    "abstract": "Binary code search plays a crucial role in applications like software reuse\ndetection. Currently, existing models are typically based on either internal\ncode semantics or a combination of function call graphs (CG) and internal code\nsemantics. However, these models have limitations. Internal code semantic\nmodels only consider the semantics within the function, ignoring the\ninter-function semantics, making it difficult to handle situations such as\nfunction inlining. The combination of CG and internal code semantics is\ninsufficient for addressing complex real-world scenarios. To address these\nlimitations, we propose BinEnhance, a novel framework designed to leverage the\ninter-function semantics to enhance the expression of internal code semantics\nfor binary code search. Specifically, BinEnhance constructs an External\nEnvironment Semantic Graph (EESG), which establishes a stable and analogous\nexternal environment for homologous functions by using different inter-function\nsemantic relations (e.g., call, location, data-co-use). After the construction\nof EESG, we utilize the embeddings generated by existing internal code semantic\nmodels to initialize nodes of EESG. Finally, we design a Semantic Enhancement\nModel (SEM) that uses Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCNs) and a\nresidual block to learn valuable external semantics on the EESG for generating\nthe enhanced semantics embedding. In addition, BinEnhance utilizes data feature\nsimilarity to refine the cosine similarity of semantic embeddings. We conduct\nexperiments under six different tasks (e.g., under function inlining scenario)\nand the results illustrate the performance and robustness of BinEnhance. The\napplication of BinEnhance to HermesSim, Asm2vec, TREX, Gemini, and Asteria on\ntwo public datasets results in an improvement of Mean Average Precision (MAP)\nfrom 53.6% to 69.7%.

Through comprehensive\nexperimentation with varying state-of-the-art models and tasks, we find that SC\nnot only fails to improve but actively degrades performance on long-context\ntasks.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors are\ncurrently implemented across a variety of hardware platforms, each with their\nown distinct gatesets. As such, circuit compilation should not only be aware\nof, but also deeply connect to, the native gateset and noise properties of\neach. Trapped-ion processors are one such platform that provides a gateset that\ncan be continuously parameterized across both one- and two-qubit gates. Here we\nuse the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed (QSCOUT) to study\nnoise-aware compilations focused on continuously parameterized two-qubit\n$\\mathcal{ZZ}$ gates (based on the M{\\o}lmer-S{\\o}rensen interaction) using\n$\\textbf{Superstaq}$, a quantum software platform for hardware-aware circuit\ncompiler optimizations. We discuss the realization of $\\mathcal{ZZ}$ gates with\narbitrary angle on the all-to-all connected trapped-ion system. Then we discuss\na variety of different compiler optimizations that innately target these\n$\\mathcal{ZZ}$ gates and their noise properties. These optimizations include\nmoving from a restricted maximally entangling gateset to a continuously\nparameterized one, swap mirroring to further reduce total entangling angle of\nthe operations, focusing the heaviest $\\mathcal{ZZ}$ angle participation on the\nbest performing gate pairs, and circuit approximation to remove the least\nimpactful $\\mathcal{ZZ}$ gates. We demonstrate these compilation approaches on\nthe hardware with randomized quantum volume circuits, observing the potential\nto realize a larger quantum volume as a result of these optimizations. Using\ndiffering yet complementary analysis techniques, we observe the distinct\nimprovements in system performance provided by these noise-aware compilations\nand study the role of stochastic and coherent error channels for each\ncompilation choice.",

    "abstract": "Fact verification on tabular evidence incentivises the use of symbolic\nreasoning models where a logical form is constructed (e.g. a LISP-style\nprogram), providing greater verifiability than fully neural approaches.\nHowever, these systems typically rely on well-formed tables, restricting their\nuse in many scenarios. An emerging symbolic reasoning paradigm for textual\nevidence focuses on natural logic inference, which constructs proofs by\nmodelling set-theoretic relations between a claim and its evidence in natural\nlanguage. This approach provides flexibility and transparency but is less\ncompatible with tabular evidence since the relations do not extend to\narithmetic functions. We propose a set-theoretic interpretation of numerals and\narithmetic functions in the context of natural logic, enabling the integration\nof arithmetic expressions in deterministic proofs. We leverage large language\nmodels to generate arithmetic expressions by generating questions about salient\nparts of a claim which are answered by executing appropriate functions on\ntables. In a few-shot setting on FEVEROUS, we achieve an accuracy of 71.4,\noutperforming both fully neural and symbolic reasoning models by 3.4 points.\nWhen evaluated on TabFact without any further training, our method remains\ncompetitive with an accuracy lead of 0.5 points.",

    "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly difficult to improve the performance of a a\nsingle process (thread) on a computer due to physical limitations. Modern\nsystems use multi-core processors in which multiple processes (threads) may run\nconcurrently. A lock-free data structure can allow these processes to\ncommunicate with each other without requiring mutual exclusion, and may\nincrease the amount of work they may perform in parallel rather than\nsequentially, thus improving the performance of the system as a whole. This\npaper contains an implementation of Ko's Lock-Free Binary Trie, which stores a\ndynamic set of keys from an ordered universe. It supports insert, remove,\nsearch and predecessor operations. One novel component of this implementation\nis a lock-free linked list which allows multiple processes to attempt to insert\nthe same node, but which prevents a node from being reinserted once it has been\nremoved from the list. The final section of this paper contains an experimental\ncomparison of this implementation against other data structures which implement\nthe same abstract data type (ADT) as the lock-free trie. Analysis of these\nexperiments reveal that the implementation of Ko's Trie performs better than\nexisting theoretical implementations of this ADT when the universe of keys is\nlarge, when removes are rare and when the number of processes performing\noperations concurrently is low.",

    "abstract": "Surface acoustic waves are commonly used in a variety of radio-frequency\nelectrical devices as a result of their operation at high frequencies and\nrobust nature. For devices based on Rayleigh-like plane waves, functionality is\nbased on the fact that the Rayleigh wave mode is confined at the solid-air\ninterface. However, to create advanced functionality through the use of\nphononic crystal structures, standard cylindrical inclusions have been shown to\ncouple Rayleigh modes to the shear horizontal bulk modes and provide a\nsignificant pathway to energy loss. We introduce alternative inclusion shapes\nwith a reduced 2-fold symmetry that lowers the speed of the Rayleigh-like\nsurface acoustic wave to below that of the shear horizontal mode. With an\neigenfrequency below the sound line, the new mode is confined to the surface\nwith limited coupling and loss to the bulk. Based on these inclusions, an\nacoustic waveguide design is proposed that demonstrates a strong confinement of\nwave energy both at the surface and within the waveguide.",

Our theoretical analysis\nproves that CRONOS converges to the global minimum of the convex reformulation\nunder mild assumptions. In addition, we validate the efficacy of CRONOS and\nCRONOS-AM through extensive large-scale numerical experiments with GPU\nacceleration in JAX. Our results show that CRONOS-AM can obtain comparable or\nbetter validation accuracy than predominant tuned deep learning optimizers on\nvision and language tasks with benchmark datasets such as ImageNet and IMDb.

In tests on a\ndiverse corpus of 18th/19th century English language handwritten documents,\nLLMs achieved Character Error Rates (CER) of 5.7 to 7% and Word Error Rates\n(WER) of 8.9 to 15.9%, improvements of 14% and 32% respectively over\nspecialized state-of-the-art HTR software like Transkribus. Most significantly,\nwhen LLMs were then used to correct those transcriptions as well as texts\ngenerated by conventional HTR software, they achieved near-human levels of\naccuracy, that is CERs as low as 1.8% and WERs of 3.5%. The LLMs also completed\nthese tasks 50 times faster and at approximately 1/50th the cost of proprietary\nHTR programs.
