    "abstract": "Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation\nwithin a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on\nimage-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss\nfine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a\nsimple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a\nresource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding\nencoder embeddings as dense \"text prompts,\" providing rich supervision without\ncaptions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding\nembeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a\nself-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and\ngeneration. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across\nautoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it\nconsistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,\npost-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on\nGenEval (0.73$\\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\\rightarrow$88.15), while\nalso boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit\n6.94$\\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models\nand applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an\nefficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs",

This work shows that gain and bandwidth can be\nincreased by modifying the relative distance between junctions within the same\nunit cell, thus increasing the effective nonlinear interaction. We find an\noptimal sub-unit-cell size ratio, which maximizes both gain and bandwidth,\nwhile equally spaced junctions offer minimum performance.

The construction of initial data is a multi-step process,\nin which one first chooses freely specifiable data that define a conformal\nbackground and impose boundary conditions. Then, one numerically solves\nelliptic equations and calculates physical properties such as horizon masses,\nspins, and asymptotic quantities from the solution. To achieve desired\nproperties, one adjusts the free data in an iterative ``control'' loop.\nPrevious methods for these iterative adjustments rely on Newtonian\napproximations and do not allow the direct control of total energy and angular\nmomentum of the system, which becomes particularly important in the study of\nhyperbolic encounters of black holes. Using the $\\texttt{SpECTRE}$ code, we\npresent a novel parameter control procedure that benefits from Broyden's method\nin all controlled quantities. We use this control scheme to minimize drifts in\nbound orbits and to enable the construction of hyperbolic encounters. We see\nthat the activation of off-diagonal terms in the control Jacobian gives us\nbetter efficiency when compared to the simpler implementation in the Spectral\nEinstein Code ($\\texttt{SpEC}$). We demonstrate robustness of the method across\nextreme configurations, including spin magnitudes up to $\\chi = 0.9999$, mass\nratios up to $q = 50$, and initial separations up to $D_0 = 1000M$.

In this work, we propose Kernel VICReg, a novel self-supervised\nlearning framework that lifts the VICReg objective into a Reproducing Kernel\nHilbert Space (RKHS). By kernelizing each term of the loss-variance,\ninvariance, and covariance--we obtain a general formulation that operates on\ndouble-centered kernel matrices and Hilbert-Schmidt norms, enabling nonlinear\nfeature learning without explicit mappings.\n  We demonstrate that Kernel VICReg not only avoids representational collapse\nbut also improves performance on tasks with complex or small-scale data.\nEmpirical evaluations across MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, TinyImageNet, and\nImageNet100 show consistent gains over Euclidean VICReg, with particularly\nstrong improvements on datasets where nonlinear structures are prominent.

Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, malicious users\ncan synthesize phishing emails that are free from spelling mistakes and other\neasily detectable features. Furthermore, such models can generate\ntopic-specific phishing messages, tailoring content to the target domain and\nincreasing the likelihood of success.\n  Detecting such content remains a significant challenge, as LLM-generated\nphishing emails often lack clear or distinguishable linguistic features. As a\nresult, most existing semantic-level detection approaches struggle to identify\nthem reliably. While certain LLM-based detection methods have shown promise,\nthey suffer from high computational costs and are constrained by the\nperformance of the underlying language model, making them impractical for\nlarge-scale deployment.\n  In this work, we aim to address this issue. We propose Paladin, which embeds\ntrigger-tag associations into vanilla LLM using various insertion strategies,\ncreating them into instrumented LLMs. When an instrumented LLM generates\ncontent related to phishing, it will automatically include detectable tags,\nenabling easier identification. Based on the design on implicit and explicit\ntriggers and tags, we consider four distinct scenarios in our work.

The classical\n$\\mathsf{CountSketch}$ algorithm due to Charikar, Chen, and Farach-Colton\n[2004], was the first algorithm to detect $\\ell_2$ heavy hitters using\n$O\\left(\\frac{\\log^2 n}{\\epsilon}\\right)$ bits of space, and their algorithm is\noptimal for streams with deletions.

We also show that for\npartially random order streams where only the heavy hitters are required to be\nuniformly distributed in the stream, it is possible to achieve the same space\nbound, but with an additional assumption that the algorithm is given a constant\napproximation to $F_2$ in advance.",

Unlike\nsorting-based antisymmetrization algorithms, which require ordered input states\nand high Clifford-gate overhead, our approach initializes the state of each\nparticle independently. For a system of $N$ particles and $N_s$ single-particle\nstates, our algorithm prepares antisymmetrized states of non-trivial localized\n(e.g., Hartree-Fock) orbitals using $O(N^2\\sqrt{N_s})$ $T$-gates, outperforming\nalternative algorithms when $N\\lesssim \\sqrt{N_s}$. To achieve such scaling, we\nrequire $O(\\sqrt{N_s})$ dirty ancilla qubits for intermediate calculations.\nKnowledge of the single-particle states to be antisymmetrized can be leveraged\nto further improve the efficiency of the circuit, and a measurement-based\nvariant reduces gate cost by roughly a factor of two.

In QRTs, quantum states serve as static resources, while quantum\nchannels give rise to dynamical resources. A recent major advance in QRTs is\nthe generalized quantum Stein's lemma, which characterizes the optimal error\nexponent in hypothesis testing to discriminate resource states from free\nstates, enabling a reversible QRT framework for static resources where\nasymptotic conversion rates are fully determined by the regularized relative\nentropy of resource. However, applications of QRTs to channel conversion\nrequire a framework for dynamical resources. The earlier extension of the\nreversible framework to a fundamental class of dynamical resources, represented\nby classical-quantum (CQ) channels, relied on state-based techniques and\nimposed an asymptotic continuity assumption on operations, which prevented its\napplicability to conventional channel coding scenarios. To overcome this\nproblem, we formulate and prove a generalized quantum Stein's lemma directly\nfor CQ channels, by developing CQ-channel counterparts of the core proof\ntechniques used in the state setting. Building on this result, we construct a\nreversible QRT framework for CQ channel conversion that does not require the\nasymptotic continuity assumption, and show that this framework applies to the\nanalysis of channel coding scenarios.

    "abstract": "Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers achieve optimal sensitivity for\ndark matter in the $10$--$1000~\\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass range, but sub-GeV dark\nmatter particles lack sufficient energy to produce nuclear recoils above\ndetection thresholds in these detectors. Blazar-boosted dark matter offers a\nway to overcome this limitation: relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei\ncan accelerate light dark matter in their host-galaxy halos to energies capable\nof producing detectable nuclear recoil signals in xenon-based detectors on\nEarth. We present the first blazar-boosted dark matter search incorporating\ndetector response modeling, using public data from XENON1T and LZ for the\nblazar TXS~0506+056. We model dark matter--proton scattering in the jet\nenvironment, covering the full process from jet acceleration to detector\nresponse. We explore how the host-galaxy dark matter density profile impacts\nour analysis. Using XENON1T data, we exclude dark matter--nucleon cross\nsections for $m_\\chi \\sim 1~\\mathrm{MeV}$ in the range $5.8\\times\n10^{-31}~\\mathrm{cm^2} \\lesssim \\sigma_{\\chi n} \\lesssim 6.3\\times\n10^{-29}~\\mathrm{cm^2}$, and using LZ EFT searches we constrain $9.9\\times\n10^{-32}~\\mathrm{cm^2} \\lesssim \\sigma_{\\chi n} \\lesssim 2.5\\times\n10^{-28}~\\mathrm{cm^2}$. Our results show that astrophysical uncertainties,\nespecially the dark matter density profile near the supermassive black hole,\nset the primary limitation on the sensitivity rather than detector systematics.\nThese findings highlight blazar-boosted dark matter as a promising probe of\nlight dark matter and motivate further astrophysical modeling.",

The method addresses two key challenges: (\\rmnum{1}) accurately\nmodeling heterogeneous non-Markovian effects where the memory function depends\non the coarse-grained (CG) variables beyond the standard homogeneous kernel,\nand (\\rmnum{2}) efficiently exploring the phase space to sample both\nequilibrium and dynamical observables for reduced model construction.\nSpecifically, we employ a consensus-based sampling method to establish a shared\nsampling strategy that enables simultaneous construction of the free energy\nfunction and collection of conditional two-point correlation functions used to\nlearn the state-dependent memory. The reduced dynamics is formulated as an\nextended Markovian system, where a set of auxiliary variables, interpreted as\nnon-Markovian features, is jointly learned to systematically approximate the\nmemory function using only two-point statistics. The constructed model yields a\ngeneralized Langevin-type formulation with an invariant distribution consistent\nwith the full dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework on a two-dimensional CG model of an alanine dipeptide molecule.\nNumerical results on the transition dynamics between metastable states show\nthat accurately capturing state-dependent memory is essential for predicting\nnon-equilibrium kinetic properties, whereas the standard generalized Langevin\nmodel with a homogeneous kernel exhibits significant discrepancies.",

For\nBayesian inference it employs advanced Monte Carlo sampling techniques such as\nMetropolis-Hastings, Metropolis-adjusted Langevin (MALA), and Hamiltonian Monte\nCarlo (HMC). Unlike many existing extreme value theory (EVT) tools, which can\nbe complex or lack Bayesian options, nsEVDx offers an intuitive, Python-native\ninterface that is both user-friendly and extensible. It requires only standard\nscientific Python libraries (numpy, scipy) for its core functionality, while\noptional features like plotting and diagnostics use matplotlib and seaborn. A\nkey feature of nsEVDx is its flexible support for non-stationary modeling,\nwhere the location, scale, and shape parameters can each depend on arbitrary,\nuser-defined covariates. This enables practical applications such as linking\nextremes to other variables (e.g., rainfall extremes to temperature or maximum\nstock market losses to market volatility indices).

We performed\nabsorption-resolved spectral analyses during two time intervals of interest:\nthe soft and hard hardness ratio (HR) intervals, as it is strongly correlated\nwith absorption variability. We observed a sudden transition in the HR from a\nsoft to a hard state, coinciding with an increase in the absorption column\ndensity.

These tasks represent a\nnatural progression from the simple, single-aspect queries that are used in the\nvast majority of existing, commonly used evaluation sets. Complex queries\nnaturally arise as people expect search systems to handle more specific and\noften ambitious information requests, as is demonstrated by how people use\nLLM-based information systems. Despite the growing desire for retrieval models\nto expand their capabilities in complex retrieval tasks, there exist limited\nresources to assess the ability of retrieval models on a comprehensive set of\ndiverse complex tasks. The few resources that do exist feature a limited scope\nand often lack realistic settings making it hard to know the true capabilities\nof retrieval models on complex real-world retrieval tasks. To address this\nshortcoming and spur innovation in next-generation retrieval models, we\nconstruct a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks and benchmark\na representative set of state-of-the-art retrieval models. Additionally, we\nexplore the impact of LLM-based query expansion and rewriting on retrieval\nquality.

We then use an indirect approach based on a single\nlayer ansatz. The discrete single layer matrix is nearly singular close to\nexceptional wavenumbers, and we use a reduced singular value decomposition to\navoid the consequent ill-conditioning.

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive analysis of the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a\nmassive scalar field in Schwarzschild spacetime using two complementary\nnumerical techniques: the Hill-determinant method and Leaver continued-fraction\nmethod. Our study systematically compares the performance, convergence, and\nconsistency of the two approaches across a wide range of field masses and\nangular momenta. We identify three critical mass thresholds, $m_{\\rm lim}$,\n$m_{\\rm max}$, and $m_{zd}$, which govern qualitative changes in the QNM\nspectrum. In particular, long-lived modes emerge at $m_{zd}$, where the\nimaginary part of the frequency vanishes and the mode becomes essentially\nnon-decaying. This phenomenon is robust across multipoles and may have\nimportant implications for the phenomenology of massive fields around black\nholes. Our results provide a detailed numerical characterization of massive\nscalar QNMs and highlight the complementary strengths of the Hill-determinant\nand continued-fraction methods, paving the way for future studies of rotating\nor charged black holes and quasi-bound states.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) traditionally focuses on collision avoidance,\nbut many real-world applications require active coordination between agents to\nimprove team performance. This paper introduces Team Coordination on Graphs\nwith Risky Edges (TCGRE), where agents collaborate to reduce traversal costs on\nhigh-risk edges via support from teammates. We reformulate TCGRE as a 3D\nmatching problem-mapping robot pairs, support pairs, and time steps-and\nrigorously prove its NP-hardness via reduction from Minimum 3D Matching. To\naddress this complexity, (in the conference version) we proposed efficient\ndecomposition methods, reducing the problem to tractable subproblems:\nJoint-State Graph (JSG): Encodes coordination as a single-agent shortest-path\nproblem. Coordination-Exhaustive Search (CES): Optimizes support assignments\nvia exhaustive pairing. Receding-Horizon Optimistic Cooperative A* (RHOCA*):\nBalances optimality and scalability via horizon-limited planning. Further in\nthis extension, we introduce a dynamic graph construction method\n(Dynamic-HJSG), leveraging agent homogeneity to prune redundant states and\nreduce computational overhead by constructing the joint-state graph\ndynamically. Theoretical analysis shows Dynamic-HJSG preserves optimality while\nlowering complexity from exponential to polynomial in key cases. Empirical\nresults validate scalability for large teams and graphs, with HJSG\noutperforming baselines greatly in runtime in different sizes and types of\ngraphs. This work bridges combinatorial optimization and multi-agent planning,\noffering a principled framework for collaborative pathfinding with provable\nguarantees, and the key idea of the solution can be widely extended to many\nother collaborative optimization problems, such as MAPF.",

    "abstract": "Polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes have recently emerged as a\npromising class of error-correcting codes, achieving near-capacity performance\nparticularly in the short block-length regime. In this paper, we propose an\nenhanced stack decoding algorithm for PAC codes that significantly improves\nparallelization by exploiting specialized bit nodes, such as rate-0 and rate-1\nnodes. For a rate-1 node with $N_0$ leaf nodes in its corresponding subtree,\nconventional stack decoding must either explore all $2^{N_0}$ paths, or, same\nas in fast list decoding, restrict attention to a constant number of candidate\npaths. In contrast, our approach introduces a pruning technique that discards\nwrong paths with a probability exponentially approaching zero, retaining only\nthose whose path metrics remain close to their expected mean values.\nFurthermore, we propose a novel approximation method for estimating variance\npolarization under the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (BI-AWGN)\nchannel. Leveraging these approximations, we develop an efficient stack-pruning\nstrategy that selectively preserves decoding paths whose bit-metric values\nalign with their expected means. This targeted pruning substantially reduces\nthe number of active paths in the stack, thereby decreasing both decoding\nlatency and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that for a\nPAC(128,64) code, our method achieves up to a 70% reduction in the average\nnumber of paths without degrading error-correction performance.",

    "abstract": "The deployment of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) systems cannot rely solely on digital precoding due to hardware\nconstraints. Instead, hybrid precoding, which combines digital and radio\nfrequency (RF) techniques, has emerged as a potential alternative. This\napproach strikes a balance between performance and cost, addressing the\nlimitations of signal mixers and analog-to-digital converters in mmWave\nsystems. mmWave systems are designed to function in wideband channels with\nfrequency selectivity, necessitating the use of orthogonal frequency-division\nmultiplexing (OFDM) to mitigate dispersive channels. However, OFDM faces\nseveral challenges. First, it suffers from a high peak-to-average power ratio\n(PAPR) due to the linear combination of subcarriers. Second, it suffers from\nout-of-band (OOB) emissions due to the sharp spectral transitions of OFDM\nsubcarriers and windowing-induced spectral leakage. Furthermore, phase shifter\n(PS) impairments at the RF transmitter precoder and the user combiner represent\na limitation in practical mmWave systems, leading to phase errors. This work\naddresses these challenges.\n  We study the problem of robust digital-RF precoding optimization for the\ndownlink sum-rate maximization in hybrid multi-user (MU) MIMO-OFDM systems\nunder maximum transmit power, PAPR, and OOB emission constraints. The\nformulated maximization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve. We\npropose a weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) based block coordinate\ndescent (BCD) method to iteratively optimize digital-RF precoders at the\ntransmitter and digital-RF combiners at the users. Low-cost and scalable\noptimization approaches are proposed to efficiently solve the BCD subproblems.\nExtensive simulation results are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the\nproposed approaches and exhibit their superiority relative to well-known\nbenchmarks.",

In order to achieve the high energy\nresolution requirements for CUPID, the readout noise of the system must be kept\nto a minimum.

In this work, we characterize the readout noise of the newly\ndesigned frequency multiplexed TES readout system for CUPID and construct a\nnoise model to understand it. We find that current sharing between the SQUID\ncoil impedance and other branches of the circuit, as well as the long output\nwiring, worsen the readout noise of the system. To meet noise requirements, a\nSQUID with a low input inductance, high transimpedance and/or low dynamic\nimpedance is needed, and the wiring capacitance should be kept as small as\npossible.

    "abstract": "Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable\nmeasurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains\ndifficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle\nnoise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly\nlocalized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce\ncoarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms\nrecover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,\ndual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically\ngrounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes\nwhole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local\nU-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that\ndescribe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)\nterms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring\nno manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using\nfive-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over\nUnion (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess\nthe roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.\nResults: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice\nof 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions\nshow the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious\nactivations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global\ncontext, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A\ndual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with\nlocal precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness\nfor small, low-contrast lesions.",

To address these issues, MSIGOA\nproposes an iteration-based updating framework that switches between\nexploitation and exploration according to the optimization process, which\neffectively enhances the balance between local exploitation and global\nexploration in the optimization process and improves the convergence speed. Two\nadaptive parameter tuning strategies improve the applicability of the algorithm\nand promote a smoother optimization process. The dominant population-based\nrestart strategy enhances the algorithms ability to escape from local optima\nand avoid its premature convergence. These enhancements significantly improve\nthe exploration and exploitation capabilities of MSIGOA, bringing superior\nconvergence and efficiency in dealing with complex problems. In this paper, the\nparameter sensitivity, strategy effectiveness, convergence and stability of the\nproposed method are evaluated on two benchmark test sets including CEC2017 and\nCEC2022. Test results and statistical tests show that MSIGOA outperforms basic\nGOA and other advanced algorithms. On the CEC2017 and CEC2022 test sets, the\nproportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than GOA is 92.2% and 83.3%,\nrespectively, and the proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than\nother algorithms is 88.57% and 87.5%, respectively.

Then, within this framework, we analyze three market\nmechanisms: (a) a single-product real-time energy market, (b) a\nproduct-differentiated real-time energy market that treats solar energy and\ngrid energy as different products, and (c) a contract-based panel market that\ntrades claims or rights to the production of certain panel capacity ex-ante,\nrather than the realized solar production ex-post. For each, we derive\nexpressions for short-term equilibria and the associated expected revenues, and\nanalytically characterize the corresponding long-term Nash equilibrium\naggregate capacity. We compare the solutions of these characterizing equations\nunder different conditions and theoretically establish that the\nproduct-differentiated market always supports socially optimal investment,\nwhile the single-product market consistently results in under-investment.

Although the\nRankine body serves as a cornerstone for the classical theory of potential\nflow, its behavior in viscous flow remains unexplored. The Rankine oval is\nstreamlined in inviscid flow but behaves as a bluff body in viscous flow. The\nonset of vortex shedding is a critical phenomenon in flows past a bluff body,\nmapping the transition from steady to periodic wakes. This study systematically\ninvestigates the onset of vortex shedding in Rankine oval flows and its\nassociated fluid dynamics by performing direct numerical simulations of\nincompressible flow past Rankine ovals over Reynolds numbers from 10 to 200 and\nUa/m from 0 to 1.

This analysis identifies the\ndimensionless quantities and empirical formula that determine St and the\nfriction drag coefficient as a function of Re, independent of Ua/m. For\nsufficiently large Ua/m, the pressure drag can be estimated using potential\nflow solutions, enabling reliable predictions of the total drag without\nnumerical simulations.

Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant\ngaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across\npatient profiles.

We\nvalidated our automated deep learning (DL) tool measuring the Global Cerebral\nAtrophy (GCA) score against trained human raters, and associations with age and\ncognitive impairment, in representative older (>65 years) patients. CT-brain\nscans were obtained from patients in acute medicine (ORCHARD-EPR), acute stroke\n(OCS studies) and a legacy sample. Scans were divided in a 60/20/20 ratio for\ntraining, optimisation and testing. CT-images were assessed by two trained\nraters (rater-1=864 scans, rater-2=20 scans). Agreement between DL\ntool-predicted GCA scores (range 0-39) and the visual ratings was evaluated\nusing mean absolute error (MAE) and Cohen's weighted kappa. Among 864 scans\n(ORCHARD-EPR=578, OCS=200, legacy scans=86), MAE between the DL tool and\nrater-1 GCA scores was 3.2 overall, 3.1 for ORCHARD-EPR, 3.3 for OCS and 2.6\nfor the legacy scans and half had DL-predicted GCA error between -2 and 2.\nInter-rater agreement was Kappa=0.45 between the DL-tool and rater-1, and 0.41\nbetween the tool and rater- 2 whereas it was lower at 0.28 for rater-1 and\nrater-2.

Different from the existing methods, we present an edge-based search\nscheme to find clipping planes (bisectors). A test called point-in-cell is\nfirst set up to tell whether a space point is in a target Voronoi cell or not.\nThen, for each edge of the intermediate domain-cell intersection, we will\nlaunch a clipping only if its two endpoints are respectively inside and outside\nthe corresponding Voronoi cell, where the bisector for the clipping can be\nfound by using a few times of point-in-cell tests. Therefore, our method only\ninvolves the clippings that contribute to the final results, which is a great\nadvantage over the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, because each\ndomain-cell intersection can be generated independently, we extend the proposed\nmethod to the GPUs for computing Voronoi diagrams in parallel. The experimental\nresults show the best performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art\nones, regardless of site distribution. This paper was first submitted to\nSIGGRAPH Asia 2025.",

Additionally, to account for general correlation profiles\nand fading environments with variable diversity and coding gains, we consider\narbitrarily correlated Nakagami-m fading channels. The analytical results show\nthat fading correlation induces a horizontal shift in the asymptotic behavior\n-- represented as a straight line in the log-dB scale -- of the PDF and CDF,\ndisplacing these curves to the left. The asymptotic linear coefficient\nquantifies this shift, while the angular coefficient remains unaffected.\nMoreover, the results reveal that the high sensitivity of the linear\ncoefficient to correlation arises from the aggregated contribution of all\nmarginal asymptotic terms, effectively capturing each channel's correlation\ncharacteristics.",

However, both experimental and simulation\napproaches face significant challenges in efficiently exploring the vast design\nspace of charge-compatibilized polymer blends, encompassing chemical\ninteractions, architectural properties, and composition. In this work, we\nintroduce a white-box machine learning approach integrated with polymer field\ntheory to predict the phase behavior of these systems, which is significantly\nmore accurate than conventional black-box machine learning approaches. The\nrandom phase approximation (RPA) calculation is used as a testbed to determine\npolymer phases. Instead of directly predicting the polymer phase output of RPA\ncalculations from a large input space by a machine learning model, we build a\nparallel partial Gaussian process model to predict the most computationally\nintensive component of the RPA calculation that only involves polymer\narchitecture parameters as inputs. This approach substantially reduces the\ncomputational cost of the RPA calculation across a vast input space with nearly\n100% accuracy for out-of-sample prediction, enabling rapid screening of polymer\nblend charge-compatibilization designs.

Optimization-based approaches show strong performance, but tend\nto be sensitive to initialization and are potentially time-consuming. As an\nalternative, the generator-evaluator-planner framework has been proposed. A\ngenerator generates grasp candidates, an evaluator ranks the proposed grasps,\nand a motion planner plans a trajectory to the highest-ranked grasp. If the\nplanner doesn't find a trajectory, a new trajectory optimization is started\nwith the next-best grasp as the target and so on. However, executing\nlower-ranked grasps means a lower chance of grasp success, and multiple\ntrajectory optimizations are time-consuming. Alternatively, relaxing the\nthreshold for motion planning accuracy allows for easier computation of a\nsuccessful trajectory but implies lower accuracy in estimating grasp success\nlikelihood. It's a lose-lose proposition: either spend more time finding a\nsuccessful trajectory or have a worse estimate of grasp success. We propose a\nframework that plans trajectories to a set of generated grasp targets in\nparallel, the evaluator estimates the grasp success likelihood of the resulting\ntrajectories, and the robot executes the trajectory most likely to succeed. To\nplan trajectories to different targets efficiently, we propose the use of a\nvectorized motion planner.

    "abstract": "Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by\ngenerating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite\nrecent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL\nmethods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases\nand complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present\n\\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \\emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and\n\\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning\nlanguage models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt\ntwo pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group\nself-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large\nlanguage models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL\npipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially\ndesigned reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,\nSpider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the\nverbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\\% higher than SOTA, and\nthe CoT pipeline is 1.4\\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields\nstrong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.\nOverall, \\emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic\nindustrial constraints.

    "abstract": "We present Bodega, the first consensus protocol that serves linearizable\nreads locally from any desired node, regardless of interfering writes. Bodega\nachieves this via a novel roster leases algorithm that safeguards the roster, a\nnew notion of cluster metadata. The roster is a generalization of leadership;\nit tracks arbitrary subsets of replicas as responder nodes for local reads. A\nconsistent agreement on the roster is established through roster leases, an\nall-to-all leasing mechanism that generalizes existing all-to-one leasing\napproaches (Leader Leases, Quorum Leases), unlocking a new point in the\nprotocol design space. Bodega further employs optimistic holding and early\naccept notifications to minimize interruption from interfering writes, and\nincorporates smart roster coverage and lightweight heartbeats to maximize\npracticality. Bodega is a non-intrusive extension to classic consensus; it\nimposes no special requirements on writes other than a responder-covering\nquorum. We implement Bodega and related works in Vineyard, a protocol-generic\nreplicated key-value store written in async Rust. We compare it to previous\nprotocols (Leader Leases, EPaxos, PQR, and Quorum Leases) and two production\ncoordination services (etcd and ZooKeeper). Bodega speeds up average client\nread requests by 5.6x-13.1x on real WAN clusters versus previous approaches\nunder moderate write interference, delivers comparable write performance,\nsupports fast proactive roster changes as well as fault tolerance via leases,\nand closely matches the performance of sequentially-consistent etcd and\nZooKeeper deployments across all YCSB workloads.

    "abstract": "Important nonlinear dynamics, such as those found in plasma and fluid\nsystems, are typically hard to simulate on classical computers. Thus, if\nfault-tolerant quantum computers could efficiently solve such nonlinear\nproblems, it would be a transformative change for many industries. In a recent\nbreakthrough [Liu et al., PNAS 2021], the first efficient quantum algorithm for\nsolving nonlinear differential equations was constructed, based on a single\ncondition $R<1$, where $R$ characterizes the ratio of nonlinearity to\ndissipation. This result, however, is limited to the class of purely\ndissipative systems with negative log-norm, which excludes application to many\nimportant problems. In this work, we correct technical issues with this and\nother prior analysis, and substantially extend the scope of nonlinear dynamical\nsystems that can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer in a number of\nways. Firstly, we extend the existing results from purely dissipative systems\nto a much broader class of stable systems, and show that every quadratic\nLyapunov function for the linearized system corresponds to an independent\n$R$-number criterion for the convergence of the Carlemen scheme. Secondly, we\nextend our stable system results to physically relevant settings where\nconserved polynomial quantities exist. Finally, we provide extensive results\nfor the class of non-resonant systems. With this, we are able to show that\nefficient quantum algorithms exist for a much wider class of nonlinear systems\nthan previously known, and prove the BQP-completeness of nonlinear oscillator\nproblems of exponential size. In our analysis, we also obtain several results\nrelated to the Poincar\\'{e}-Dulac theorem and diagonalization of the Carleman\nmatrix, which could be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "The interpretation of the P-value and its monotone transform s=-log2(p), or\nS-value, remains debated despite decades of dedicated literature. Within the\nneo-Fisherian framework, these values are often described as indices of\n(in)compatibility between the observed data and a set of ideal assumptions\n(i.e., the statistical model). In this regard, this paper proposes the\ndistinction between two domains: the model domain, where assumptions are taken\nas perfectly true and every admissible outcome is, by construction, fully\ncompatible with the model; and the real domain, where assumptions may fail and\nface empirical scrutiny. I argue that, although interpreted through an\nobjective numerical index, any level of incompatibility can arise only in the\nlatter domain, where the epistemic status of the model under examination is\nuncertain and a genuine conflict between data and hypotheses can therefore\noccur. The extent to which P- and S-values are taken as indicating\nincompatibility is a matter of contextual judgment. Within this framework,\ndescriptive approaches serve to quantify the numerical values of P and S; these\ncan be interpreted as indicative of a certain degree (or amount) of\nincompatibility between data and hypotheses once causal knowledge of the\ndata-generating process and information about the costs and benefits of related\ndecisions become clearer. Although the distinction between the model domain and\nthe real domain may appear merely theoretical or even philosophical, I argue\nthat this perspective is useful for developing a clear mental representation of\nhow statistical estimates should be evaluated in practical settings and\napplications.",

Its\ndysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from\ncardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)\nextracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a\nnoninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible\nto electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on\nbandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to\noverlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained\nmuscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight\none-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)\nbottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using\nclean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise\nfrom chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at\nrealistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the\nmodel in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework.

However, existing\nGFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent\nreal-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast,\ntabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction\ntasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time\nseries forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated\nby this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and\nreformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be\nrepresented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns,\nenabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context\nlearning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework\nthat first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders,\napplies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their\noutputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world\ndatasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and\nstate-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for\nscalable and generalizable graph learning.",

    "abstract": "Critical collapse is a well-studied subject for a variety of self-gravitating\nmatter. One of the most intensively examined models is that of perfect fluids,\nwhich have been used extensively to describe compact objects such as stars, as\nwell as being of cosmological interest. However, neutron stars are believed to\npossess an elastic crust, thus departing from a perfect fluid body, and\ncritical collapse with elastic materials is an entirely unexplored topic. In\nthis work, we employ a scale-invariant elastic matter model to study\nself-similar collapse with elasticity. As with perfect fluid models, we show\nthat including elasticity allows for continuous self-similar configurations,\nwhich we determine numerically by solving the associated boundary value\nproblem. The set of solutions is discrete and we focus on the fundamental mode,\nbut also present some results for overtones. Similarly to the perfect fluid\ncase, the existence of a sonic point plays a central role. We find that the\naddition of elasticity, by either increasing the shear index $\\mathrm{s}$ or\ndecreasing the Poisson ratio $\\nu$, leads to an increase in compressibility and\ncan yield negative radial pressures around the sonic point. Simultaneously, the\nelastic longitudinal wave speed ceases to be constant, while the two possible\ntransverse wave speeds grow further apart. The departure from the perfect fluid\ncase can be so dramatic as to generate a second sonic point, which does not\nseem to be regular. This, in turn, imposes bounds on the elasticity parameters\nof the material. This study represents the first step in the analysis of\ncritical collapse with elastic materials.",

To counteract this, several\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) audio deepfake detection (ADD) methods have been\nproposed to identify generative AI signatures to distinguish between real and\ndeepfake audio. However, the effectiveness of these methods is severely\nundermined by anti-forensic (AF) attacks that conceal generative signatures.\nThese AF attacks span a wide range of techniques, including statistical\nmodifications (e.g., pitch shifting, filtering, noise addition, and\nquantization) and optimization-based attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, C \\& W, and\nDeepFool).

They influence galaxy\nevolution by altering gas properties, regulating star formation, and shaping\ngalactic outflows. We investigate these effects using a suite of cosmological\nzoom-in simulations, which incorporate CR transport and feedback on top of the\nAuriga galaxy formation model. Our simulations span a wide range of halo\nmasses, from dwarf galaxies to small groups ($M_{200\\mathrm{c}}= 10^{10} -\n10^{13}~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$), allowing us to assess the mass-dependent impact of\nCRs in a cosmological setting. We find that CRs have the strongest impact in\nlower-mass galaxies ($M_{200\\mathrm{c}} < 10^{12}~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$), where\nthey suppress star formation rates by up to 50\\%, reduce gas and stellar\nhalf-light radii, and drive outflows that reach higher velocities at the virial\nradius compared to simulations without CRs. These CR-enhanced outflows also\ntransport more metals and magnetic fields into the CGM, leading to higher CGM\nmetallicities, stronger magnetisation, and lower CGM temperatures. In more\nmassive galaxies, CRs do not significantly affect star formation or outflow\nproperties, likely because thermal and kinetic feedback from stars and AGN\ndominate in this regime. However, CRs still influence galaxy morphology across\nall halo masses by reducing the gas half-mass radius and stellar half-light\nradius. Finally, variations in CR transport properties, such as different\ndiffusion coefficients or the exclusion of Alfv\\'en cooling, significantly\naffect star formation, CGM properties, and outflows in lower-mass galaxies.\nThis sensitivity makes these galaxies key environments for testing CR transport\nmodels and refining our understanding of their role in galaxy evolution.",

While researchers introduced deep neural networks (DNNs) to\ntackle such challenges, the existing DNNs cannot explicitly capture\ninter-alternative correlations in the discrete choice context. To address the\nchallenges, this study proposes a novel concept - alternative graph - to\nrepresent the relationships among travel mode alternatives. Using a nested\nalternative graph, this study further designs a nested-utility graph neural\nnetwork (NestGNN) as a generalization of the classical NL model in the neural\nnetwork family. Theoretically, NestGNNs generalize the classical NL models and\nexisting DNNs in terms of model representation, while retaining the crucial\ntwo-layer substitution patterns of the NL models: proportional substitution\nwithin a nest but non-proportional substitution beyond a nest. Empirically, we\nfind that the NestGNNs significantly outperform the benchmark models,\nparticularly the corresponding NL models by 9.2\\%. As shown by elasticity\ntables and substitution visualization, NestGNNs retain the two-layer\nsubstitution patterns as the NL model, and yet presents more flexibility in its\nmodel design space.

Here we investigate the detectability of exorings in\nnear-infrared reflected light using NIRCam coronagraphy PanCAKE simulations of\ntwo nearby mature stars, Proxima Centauri and Tau Ceti. Under the most\nfavorable assumptions, we find JWST 2$\\mu$m NIRCam coronagraphy (F200W +\nMASK335R) is capable of detecting an exoring system with a radius of 2.8 times\nthat of Saturn's A-ring for planets on an orbit with a = 1.3-1.9 AU.

In this case, the CUSUM statistic can be divided by\nanother statistic proportional to the long-run variance, so that the latter\ncancels. Thereby, a tedious estimation of the long-run variance can be avoided.\nUnder local stationarity, the partial sum process converges to $\\int_0^t\n\\sigma(x) d B_x$ and no such factorization is possible. To overcome this\nobstacle, a self-normalized test statistic is constructed from a carefully\ndesigned bivariate partial-sum process.

Using these fits, we\nrefine the NLO formulas describing the $2\\to 2$ pion self-interactions and\nconfirm that the NLO contributions play a crucial role in determining the\nviable parameter space of pion dark matter scenarios like the strongly\ninteracting massive particles (SIMP).",

Evidence suggests that the baryon\ncontent of group mass halos ($M_{500}\\sim10^{13}-10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$) is\nstrongly affected by galactic feedback, creating deviations from cluster\nscaling relations. Three FRBs from the first CHIME/FRB Outrigger sample come\nfrom host galaxies found within or behind galaxy clusters and groups. Using\nintegrated halo density models, we estimate the DM contribution of each\nICM/IGrM, accounting for uncertainties in halo mass and the distance to the\nhost galaxy relative to the cluster center. For the more massive halos,\npredicted cluster DMs agree with the extragalactic DM budget. One burst, FRB\n20230703A, intersects three groups yet has a low extragalactic DM. By comparing\nmodel predictions with the measured DM, we constrain the baryon fraction\n$f_g(R)$ in these halos. Comparing with published $M-f_g$ relations, we find\nconsistency with recent eROSITA results at $R_{500}$, mild tension at\n$R_{200}$, and strong tensions with earlier X-ray-based relations. As CHIME/FRB\nOutriggers build a large catalog of localized FRBs, many additional sightlines\nthrough groups and clusters will be obtained.

From high-resolution data\nwe perform a one dimension, local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis using\nPyMoogi.

The analysis yields significant insights into the chemical\ncomposition of HE2159-0551, highlighting its peculiarities among very\nmetal-poor stars. The star shows signs of internal mixing and a peculiar\nabundance pattern, particular regarding the heavy elements. We find a low Ba\nabundance (s-process element) and a suppressed contamination of r-process\nelements, even though r-process enrichment may be expected in very metal-poor\nstars. The orbital parameters and kinematic properties indicate that\nHE2159-0551 is a thick disc star, connected to the old and metal-poor\nLMS-1/Wukong progenitor resulting from an early merger. Our kinematic analysis\nsuggests a potential connection of HE2159-0551 to the merger LMS-1/Wukong. We\nconclude that the nucleosynthesis processes responsible for the star's\nenrichment in heavy elements are different from those observed in many other\nmetal-poor stars as neither the main r- nor s-process can explain the derived\nabundance pattern.

This \"Color\" technique is a powerful tool that is\nunique to fast-declining SNe Ia.

These systems, dubbed altermagnets,\nhave been the subject of intense study with direct spectroscopic evidence, from\nARPES and RIXS, techniques reported in a handful of materials in the last year.\nInelastic neutron scattering (INS) is one of the most powerful direct probes of\nmagnetism and has recently been used to witness a splitting of magnon bands in\nMnTe that is compatible with altermagnetism although the nature and origin of\nthe splitting remain to be fully characterized. However, the full power of\nneutron scattering for such systems comes from using polarized neutrons to\nmeasure the chirality of the magnon bands. Such a measurement provides a direct\ncharacterization of altermagnetism directly from the spin wave excitations. In\nthis article, we present results on MnF$_2$ once thought to be an archetypal\nantiferromagnet. We present a polarized INS data that demonstrate the material\nis, in fact, altermagnetic. It had long been realized that the magnon bands in\nthis material should have a weak splitting coming from the long-range dipolar\ncoupling. Our data is the first to visualize this splitting directly. While the\ndipolar splitting on its own is not altermagnetic, using a domain biased\nsample, the data reveals a nonzero chirality in the neutron scattering cross\nsection that reverses sign between the two magnon modes. It is this feature\nthat clearly demonstrates altermagnetism in MnF$_2$. This finding highlights\nthe potential for polarized INS to characterize altermagnets not least through\nits exquisite sensitivity to fine-structure in the magnon spectrum.",

    "abstract": "The Alfv\\'en surface -- where the solar wind exceeds the local Alfv\\'en speed\nas it expands into interplanetary space -- is now routinely probed by NASA's\nParker Solar Probe (PSP) in the near-Sun environment. The size of the Alfv\\'en\nsurface governs how efficiently the solar wind braking torque causes the Sun to\nspin-down. We aimed to characterise the size and evolution of the Alfv\\'en\nsurface as magnetic activity increased during solar cycle 25. The Alfv\\'en\nsurface was extrapolated from the solar wind mass and magnetic flux measured by\nthe SWEAP and FIELDS instrument suites onboard PSP. We accounted for the\nacceleration of the solar wind along Parker spiral magnetic field lines and\nused potential field source surface modelling to determine the sources of the\nsolar wind. The longitudinally averaged Alfv\\'en radius measured by PSP grew\nfrom 11 to 16 solar radii as solar activity increased. Accordingly, the solar\nwind angular momentum-loss rate grew from $\\sim$1.4$\\times 10^{30}$ erg to\n3$\\times 10^{30}$ erg. Both the radial and longitudinal scans of the solar wind\ncontained fluctuations of 10-40\\% from the average Alfv\\'en radius in each\nencounter. Structure in the solar corona influenced the morphology of the\nAlfv\\'en surface, which was smallest around the heliospheric current sheet and\npseudostreamers. The Alfv\\'en surface was highly structured and time-varying\nhowever, at large-scales, organised by the coronal magnetic field. The\nevolution of the solar corona over the solar cycle systematically shifted the\nmagnetic connectivity of PSP and influenced our perception of the Alfv\\'en\nsurface. The Alfv\\'en surface was 30\\% larger than both thermally-driven and\nAlfv\\'en wave-driven wind simulations with the same mass-loss rate and open\nmagnetic flux, but had a similar dependence on the wind magnetisation\nparameter.",

While the primary candidate\nis a population of GW-emitting supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), many\nother cosmological processes could produce a GWB with similar spectral\nproperties as have been measured. One key argument to help differentiate an\nSMBHB GWB from a cosmologically sourced one is its level of anisotropy; a GWB\nsourced by a finite population will likely exhibit greater anisotropy than a\ncosmological GWB through finite source effects (``shot noise'') and potentially\nlarge-scale structure. Current PTA GWB anisotropy detection methods often use\nthe frequentist PTA optimal statistic for its fast estimation of pulsar pair\ncorrelations and relatively low computational overhead compared to\nspatially-correlated Bayesian analyses. However, there are critical limitations\nwith the status quo approach. In this paper, we improve this technique by\nincorporating three recent advancements: accounting for covariance between\npulsar pairwise estimates of correlated GWB power; the per-frequency optimal\nstatistic to dissect the GWB across the spectrum; and constructing\nnull-hypothesis statistical distributions that include cosmic variance. By\ncombining these methods, our new pipeline can localize GWB anisotropies to\nspecific frequencies, through which anisotropy detection prospects -- while\nimpacted by cosmic variance -- are shown to improve in our simulations from a\n$p$-value of $\\sim0.2$ in a broadband search to $\\sim0.01$ in the per-frequency\nsearch.

    "abstract": "We analyze an ensemble of simulated prestellar cores to facilitate\ninterpretation of structure, kinematics, and lifetime of observed cores. While\nour theory predicts a \"characteristic\" density for star formation, it also\npredicts that the individual critical density varies among cores; any observed\nsample thus contains cores at various evolutionary stages within a given\ndensity bin. By analyzing the remaining lifetime, we find cores undergoing\nquasi-equilibrium collapse evolve on a timescale of twice the freefall time\nthroughout most of their life. Our analysis shows that the central column\ndensity and the associated full-width half maximum provide a reasonably\naccurate observational estimator of the central volume density, and therefore\nthe freefall time; this does, however require resolving the central column\ndensity plateau. Observations with a finite beam size tend to underestimate\ndensities of evolved cores, and this makes observed lifetimes appear to\ndecrease more steeply than the apparent freefall time. We measure from our\nsimulations the ratio of prestellar duration to envelope infall time, and find\nthis is consistent with the observed relative number of prestellar cores and\nembedded protostars. Yet, the absolute core lifetime in our simulations is\nsignificantly shorter than would be expected from empirical measurements of the\nrelative numbers of prestellar cores and Class II sources; we discuss several\npossible reasons for this discrepancy. Finally, our simulated cores have nearly\nconstant line-of-sight velocity dispersion within the emitting region in the\nsky plane, resembling observed \"coherent cores.\" We show that this \"coherence\"\nis a consequence of projection effects, which mask the intrinsic power-law\nvelocity structure function.

In this work, we introduce Fourier Neural Operators\n(FNO) as an efficient, accurate, and scalable surrogate for non-equilibrium\nquantum dynamics. Parameterized in Fourier space, FNO naturally captures\ntemporal correlations and remains minimally dependent on discretization of\ntime. We demonstrate the versatility of FNO through three complementary\nlearning paradigms: reconstructing effective Floquet Hamiltonians, predicting\nexpectation values of local observables, and learning quantum information\nspreading. For each learning task, FNO achieves remarkable accuracy, while\nattaining a significant speedup, compared to exact numerical methods. Moreover,\nFNO possesses a remarkable capacity to transfer learning across different\ntemporal discretizations and system driving frequencies. We also show that FNO\ncan extrapolate beyond the time window provided by training data, enabling\naccess to observables and operator-spreading dynamics that might otherwise be\ndifficult to obtain. By employing an appropriate local basis, we argue that the\ncomputational cost of FNOs scales only polynomially with the system size.

One\nof the few general results on high-dimensional entanglement is given by\npeel-off theorems, which relate the entanglement of a state to that of its\nlower-dimensional local projections. We build on this idea by introducing local\nextensions, the inverse process to peel-off projections, which provide a\nsystematic way to construct higher-dimensional entangled states from\nlower-dimensional ones. This dual perspective leads to general bounds on how\nthe Schmidt number can change under projections and extensions, and reveals new\nmechanisms for generating bound entangled states of higher dimensionality. As a\nconcrete application, we construct a positive-partial-transpose state of\nSchmidt number three in local dimensions $4\\times 5$, the smallest system known\nto host such entanglement. We further extend this approach to identify an\nelegant family of generalized grid states with increasing Schmidt number,\nincluding explicit examples of a $7\\times 7$ state with Schmidt number four and\na $9\\times 9$ state with Schmidt number five, suggesting $(d+1)/2$ scaling in\nodd local dimensions $d\\times d$.

We demonstrate that the stripping of DM from\nsatellites that orbit in group- and cluster-mass hosts is largely independent\nof resolution at least until 90 per cent of their initial mass at infall has\nbeen stripped. We do not find evidence for spurious disruption of galaxies due\nto insufficient resolution for the satellite masses we consider. By contrast,\nthe stripping of stellar mass is strongly resolution-dependent: each factor of\n8 improvement in particle stellar mass typically adds 2~Gyr to the stripping\ntime. Improved numerical resolution within the IllustrisTNG model generally\nresults in more compact satellites with larger stellar masses, which in turn\ngenerate more centrally concentrated stellar haloes and intra-cluster mass\nprofiles. However, the concomitant increase in stellar mass of both satellites\nand hosts may still be the cause for the overprediction of the stellar halo\nmass at large host radii relative to observations seen in some previous\nstudies.",

This timescale is consistent with the time frame\nover which pre-explosion optical outbursts were observed. However, our\nlate-time observations at 525 days post-explosion yield non-detections, and the\n3$\\sigma$ upper limits (along with an X-ray non-detection) allow us to infer\nlower-density CSM at $2\\times 10^{16}$ cm with $\\rm{\\dot{M}}$ $< 2.5\\times\n10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{M_{\\odot} \\ yr^{-1}}$. These results suggest a shell-like CSM\nfrom at most $4 \\times 10^{15}$ to $2 \\times 10^{16}$ cm ($\\sim 10^{5}\nR_{\\rm{\\odot}}$) with an elevated CSM density (0.004 $\\mathrm{M_{\\odot} \\\nyr^{-1}}$) that is roughly consistent with predictions from a merger model for\nthis object.

    "abstract": "The satellite population of the Milky Way is shaped by a range of\nastrophysical processes including mergers, star formation, feedback, and cosmic\nreionisation. Determining which processes most strongly influence its\nproperties is challenging and a key test of galaxy formation models. We train a\nneural network on the GALFORM semi-analytic model and apply a variance-based\nsensitivity analysis to characterise the influence of 11 astrophysical\nparameters on two key observables: the satellite luminosity function, and the\nmass-metallicity relation. We find that: (1) the abundance of bright satellites\n($\\mathrm{M}_V \\lesssim -13$) is regulated primarily by supernova feedback; (2)\nthe faint end of the luminosity function is shaped by the interplay between\nfeedback and reionisation; and (3) the mass-metallicity relation is governed\nalmost exclusively by feedback at all masses. We are unable to find a\ncombination of parameters in the fiducial model that fits the observed data for\nboth statistics simultaneously. To understand why, we employ SHapley Additive\nexPlanations to capture the directionality of each parameter variation. This\nenables us to pinpoint the origin of tensions in the model, showing that\nparameter adjustments that regulate the abundance of faint satellites drive\nstellar metallicities to be an order of magnitude too low and vice versa. This\ninternal \"tug-of-war\" leads us to consider extensions to the baseline model,\nsuch as metal loading in winds, or allowing the feedback strength to evolve\nwith redshift. Our study highlights the value of interrogating complex physical\nmodels through a sensitivity analysis framework by revealing high-order\nparameter interactions and non-linear responses that traditional one-at-a-time\nvariations would miss.",

In such dense\nenvironments, stars can undergo close encounters with BHs and fall within their\ntidal radius, resulting in micro-tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs),\ntransient phenomena with potential multi-messenger signatures. We performed a\nsuite of direct N-body simulations using the PETAR code, to which we\nimplemented new prescriptions for modeling micro-TDEs. We constructed a set of\nrealistic YSC models including primordial binaries, based on the observed Milky\nWay population. Our simulations incorporate stellar and binary evolution,\nsupernova kicks, and stellar winds using the BSE code, and account for the\nGalactic tidal field via the GALPY library. We identify three dynamical\nchannels for micro-TDE production: single star-single BH encounters,\nbinary-mediated interactions (including supernova-kick triggers), and\ninteractions involving higher-order multiple systems such as hierarchical\ntriples and quadruples, as well as chaotic few-body interactions. Multiple\nencounters are the most efficient production channel, which dominates the total\nrate: 350-450 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Micro-TDEs from YSCs are expected to be\ndetectable by upcoming surveys, particularly the Legacy Survey of Space and\nTime, with detection rates potentially up to hundreds per year. The\ngravitational wave (GW) signals expected from micro-TDEs peak in the deci-Hertz\nband, making them accessible to future instruments such as the Lunar\nGravitational Wave Antenna and the Deci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave\nObservatory.

The NIRSpec spectrum reveals prominent Lya\nemission (7.1 sigma), clear Ha emission (6.2 sigma), tentative Hb emission (2.8\nsigma), and no detectable [OIII]4959,5007 (~ 7 times fainter than Ha). The\ninferred [OIII] 2 sigma upper limit corresponds to an R3 index <0.85 (assuming\nthe Ha/Hb ~ 2.86 case~B recombination ratio), which, under high-ionization\nconditions, implies a metallicity of Z < 6 X 10^(-3) Z_sun. The combination of\nfaint ultraviolet luminosity, large rest-frame Ha equivalent width (~ 650 A),\nand extremely compact size (< 10 pc) suggests that LAP2 is being caught in an\nearly, pristine formation phase consistent with an instantaneous-burst\nscenario, with an estimated stellar mass of at most a few 10^4 Msun.

The previously studied Hodge theoretic classification of infinite\ndistance limits of type II, III, and IV is reflected in the number of\none-cycles of the shrinking fibres. Complementing our recent work on limits of\ntype II, we focus here on type III and type IV degenerations. Based on\neffective field theory considerations, these are expected to be\ndecompactification limits to 6d and 5d, respectively. However, establishing the\nexistence of the associated Kaluza-Klein tower(s) of states with both the\nappropriate mass scaling and the correct degeneracy requires explicit geometric\ninput. We show that the aforementioned vanishing three-cycles are special\nLagrangian three-tori, thus giving rise to towers of asymptotically massless\nBPS particles from multi-wrapped D3-branes with the degeneracy of a\nKaluza-Klein tower. We furthermore relate the BPS index of these three-cycles\nto the Euler characteristic of the threefold.

However, the high computational costs of these video\npose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.\nIn this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering\nframework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient\ntransformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with\nprogressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering\nfull-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate\ntransformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two\nkey modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module\n(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the\nredundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal\ninformation based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output\nto the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method\nis general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on\nboth seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different\ntoken pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that\nmaintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of\nrepresentative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

While synthetic\ndata offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data\ngeneration as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address\nthis, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer\narchitecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective\nlearning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over\nstandard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data.\nAs a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and\ncross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple\nbenchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs.

This study introduces a novel method for\nlearning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate\nbetter cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT\nobjective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how\nto guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs\nRL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level\nexplicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint\nSFT-RL training over RL alone.

    "abstract": "Political bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a growing concern for\nthe responsible deployment of AI systems. Traditional audits often attempt to\nlocate a model's political position as a point estimate, masking the broader\nset of ideological boundaries that shape what a model is willing or unwilling\nto say. In this paper, we draw upon the concept of the Overton Window as a\nframework for mapping these boundaries: the range of political views that a\ngiven LLM will espouse, remain neutral on, or refuse to endorse. To uncover\nthese windows, we applied an auditing-based methodology, called PRISM, that\nprobes LLMs through task-driven prompts designed to elicit political stances\nindirectly. Using the Political Compass Test, we evaluated twenty-eight LLMs\nfrom eight providers to reveal their distinct Overton Windows. While many\nmodels default to economically left and socially liberal positions, we show\nthat their willingness to express or reject certain positions varies\nconsiderably, where DeepSeek models tend to be very restrictive in what they\nwill discuss and Gemini models tend to be most expansive. Our findings\ndemonstrate that Overton Windows offer a richer, more nuanced view of political\nbias in LLMs and provide a new lens for auditing their normative boundaries.",

    "abstract": "Achieving precise control of ultracold atomic gases requires a detailed\nunderstanding of atom loss mechanisms. Motivated by the anomalous three-body\ndecay in a three-component Fermi gas reported in Ref. [1], this work\ninvestigates mechanisms that possibly contribute to the observed loss. The\nthree-body Schr\\\"odinger equation is solved in the hyperspherical adiabatic\nrepresentation with pairwise van der Waals interactions, and the $S$-matrix is\nobtained via the eigenchannel $R$-matrix method to compute recombination rate\ncoefficients $K_3$ and two-body cross sections. At the magnetic field strength\nwhere the anomalous decay occurs, $K_3$ is unitary limited, exhibiting the\nthreshold energy scaling $K_3(E)\\propto E^{-1}$. Consequently, the thermally\naveraged $\\langle K_3 \\rangle$ acquires a temperature dependence. Because the\nexperiment is performed in the degenerate regime, $\\langle K_3 \\rangle$ also\nexplicitly depends on the per-spin densities through the per-spin Fermi\nenergies $E_{F}^{(i)}\\propto n_i^{2/3}$. As the gas is diluted and degeneracy\nis reduced, $\\langle K_3 \\rangle$ approaches the non-degenerate value and\nbecomes a function of temperature only. Channel-resolved branching ratios and\ncross sections are folded into a Monte Carlo cascade simulation of secondary\ncollisions and trap escape. The analysis indicates that typical three-body\nrecombination events remove fewer than three atoms on average, and that the\natom losses are primarily due to the ejection of secondary collision products,\nrather than the initial three-body recombination products. Therefore, a\nsignificant fraction of the released binding energy remains in the trapped\nensemble as kinetic energy. Retained energy drives evaporative loss, offering a\nplausible, partial explanation for the anomalous decay.",

Motivated by\nrecent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning\ncan further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving\nReasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based\nthinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to\nguide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained\ndetails, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train\nIRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),\nwhich targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate\nstage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality\ntextual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a\nsubsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed\nlearning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full\nthinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that\nnatively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first\nbuilds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline\nin the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA\nperformance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,\nGenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality\nand fine-grained fidelity.

    "abstract": "The set of infinite upper-triangular totally positive Toeplitz matrices has a\nclassical parametrisation proved by Edrei et al and originally conjectured by\nSchoenberg, that involves pairs of sequences of positive real parameters. These\nmatrices (and their parameters) are central for understanding characters of the\ninfinite symmetric group by work of Thoma. On the other hand there is a very\ndifferent parametrisation theorem that applies to the finite analogue of this\nset. These finite Toeplitz matrices and their parameters relate to quantum\ncohomology of flag varieties and mirror symmetry. In this paper we replace the\npositive reals by a semifield with valuation to then construct tropical\nanalogues for both parametrisation theorems. In the finite case we tropicalise\nusing positive generalised Puiseaux series. This builds on work of Judd and\nL\\\"udenbach. In the infinite case we use a new valued semifield of continuous\nfunctions. We arrive at different natural infinite analogues of totally\npositive Toeplitz matrices, depending on a choice of topology on our valued\nsemifield. We then prove an asymptotic result relating the tropical parameters\nfrom the finite case to the tropicalisations of the Schoenberg parameters.\nMoreover, we show that our finite type tropical parametrisation map is given by\nLusztig's weight map from the theory of canonical bases. This results in a\nsurprising connection between the classical Edrei theorem with its Schoenberg\nparameters and Lusztig's canonical basis parametrisation.",

To address\nthe limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that\npredefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time\nsteps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are\ninterpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids\nover-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic\nRelative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as\ntext-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in\nresponse to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the\nreliance on offline reward fine-tuning.

Outcome-based RL,\nwhich rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields\nsubstantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation\ndiversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is\ncritical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL\npost-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce\neffective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our\nstudy highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,\nwhere reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and\n(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a\nlimited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose\noutcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final\noutcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,\nwhich encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch\nexploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time\ndiversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models\ndemonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity\ncollapse.

    "abstract": "As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science,\nbusiness, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an\nacute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity\nof transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI\nsolutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when\nhallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept\nrepresentations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with\nexperimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic\nexperiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer\nmodel grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the\nface of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes\nprone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to\nhallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide\nvariety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate\nactivations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we\nconfirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the\noutput of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept\npatterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights\non transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for\naligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for\npotential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic\nquantification of a model's hallucination risk.",

We\naim at determining the black hole masses and mass accretion rates of high-$z$\nblazars in a common framework that utilizes a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nfitting method and the Shakura-Sunayev multi-temperature accretion disk model,\naccounting also for attenuation due to neutral hydrogen gas in the\nintergalactic medium (IGM). We compiled a sample of 23 high-redshift blazars\nfrom the literature with publicly available infrared-to-ultraviolet photometric\ndata. We performed a Bayesian fit to the spectral energy distribution (SED) of\nthe accretion disk, accounting for upper limits, and determined the black hole\nmasses and mass accretion rates with their uncertainties. We also examined the\nimpact of optical-ultraviolet attenuation due to gas in the IGM. We find that\nneglecting IGM attenuation in SED fits leads to systematically larger\nblack-hole mass estimates and correspondingly lower Eddington ratios, with the\nbias becoming more severe at higher redshift. Our MCMC fits yield median\nblack-hole masses in the range $\\sim (10^{8}-10^{10})\\,M_{\\odot}$ and a broad\ndistribution of median Eddington ratios ($\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}\\sim 0.04 - 1$).\nComparison with previous literature shows no clear method-dependent systematic\noffsets, although individual mass estimates can differ by up to a factor of a\nfew.

This work is to our knowledge the first systematic study\nto model the accretion-disk emission of a large sample of high-$z$ blazars\nwithin a single, consistent statistical framework.

SunCastNet, coupled with\nreinforcement learning (RL) for battery scheduling, reduces operational regret\nby 76--93\\% compared to robust decision making (RDM). In 25-year investment\nbacktests, it enables up to five of ten high-emitting industrial sectors per\nregion to cross the commercial viability threshold of 12\\% Internal Rate of\nReturn (IRR). These results show that high-resolution, long-horizon solar\nforecasts can directly translate into measurable economic gains, supporting\nnear-optimal energy operations and accelerating renewable deployment.",

    "abstract": "Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and\ninterfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the\nphysical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density,\nroughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is\ninefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g.\nlithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models\nhave been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines.\nAlthough such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when\nreplacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a\nnovel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by\nperforming gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein,\nautomatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of\nthe error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these\nquantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful\nmodern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited\nin the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case\nstudies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz\nfilm, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of\norganic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library\nof differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so\nthat gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has achieved remarkable\nsuccess in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models\n(LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration\ninefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the\nmodel's capability. LLMs fail to discover viable reasoning paths when problems\nare overly difficult, while learning little new capability when problems are\ntoo simple. In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by\nquantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy.\nBuilding on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR\nframework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the\nhigh-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint\n(part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous\nhint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint\nlength for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the\noptimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In\neach round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs\ncollected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next\nround. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem\ndifficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration\nefficiency. Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5\npoints, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided\napproach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.",

The\nLyman-alpha and Continuum Origins Survey (LaCOS) is the first program to obtain\nuniform, multi-wavelength sub-kpc imaging for a sufficiently large sample (42)\nof galaxies observed in LyC to enable statistically robust studies between LyC\nand resolved galaxy properties. Here, we characterize the morphology and galaxy\nmerger properties of LaCOS galaxies and investigate their connection with the\nescape fraction of LyC emission $f_{esc}^{LyC}$. We find strong\nanti-correlations between $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ and radii ($r_{20}$, $r_{50}$, and\n$r_{80}$) measured in filters containing emission from star-forming regions,\nand with the asymmetry and clumpiness in F150LP, the bluest filter in our\ndataset, tracing UV continuum and Ly$\\alpha$.

In LyC-emitters, $\\geq41\\%$\nof the galaxies are galaxy mergers, LyC-emitting mergers have\n$f_{esc}^{LyC}=0-16\\%$. Galaxies robustly identified as mergers in LaCOS are\nall at advanced stages of interaction, close to coalescence. The\n$f_{esc}^{LyC}$ properties of mergers and non-mergers cannot be differentiated\nstatistically, and we only find significant difference between the two\npopulations in terms of their sizes, with mergers having larger sizes. We\nconclude that $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ tends to be larger in galaxies with a small\nnumber of compact, centrally-located, UV-emitting star-forming regions, that\nmerger represent a sizable fraction of LyC-emitting samples at $z\\sim0$, and\nthat mergers at advanced stages of interaction can facilitate the escape of LyC\nphotons from galaxies.",

We investigate the contamination in our sample via\n$JWST$ NIRSpec spectroscopic validation, $Chandra$ X-ray imaging, and ALMA\ninterferometry, calculating a modest total contamination fraction of\n$12.9_{-3.1}^{+4.0}$ per cent. The removal of $HST$ data increases star-forming\ngalaxy contamination by $\\simeq10$ per cent and results in a $\\simeq20$ per\ncent loss of candidates recovered from $HST$+$JWST$ data combined. We calculate\nmassive quiescent galaxy number densities at $2<z<5$, finding values three\ntimes larger than pre-$JWST$ estimates, but generally in agreement with\nmore-recent and larger-area $JWST$ studies. In comparison with galaxy evolution\nsimulations, we find that most can now reproduce the observed massive quiescent\ngalaxy number density at $2<z<3$, however they still increasingly fall short at\n$z>3$, with discrepancies of up to $\\simeq 1$ dex. We place 14 of our $z>3$\nmassive quiescent galaxies on the BPT and WHaN diagrams using medium-resolution\nspectroscopic data from the EXCELS survey. We find a very high incidence of\nfaint AGN in our sample, at a level of $\\simeq50$ per cent, consistent with\nrecent results at cosmic noon. This is interesting in the context of\nmaintenance-mode feedback, which is invoked in many simulations to prevent\nquenched galaxies from re-igniting star formation.

These patterns can then be used\nto detect event-based anomalies in a stationary system, where any deviation\nfrom past behavior may indicate malicious activity. The algorithm infers\nequivalence classes of entities with similar behavior observed from the events,\nand then builds regular expressions that capture the values of those entities.\nAs opposed to deep-learning approaches, the regular expressions are directly\ninterpretable, which also translates to interpretable anomalies. We evaluate\nHyGLAD against all 7 unsupervised anomaly detection methods from DeepOD on five\ndatasets from real-world systems.

    "abstract": "Context. Understanding the demographics of white dwarf - main sequence (WDMS)\nbinaries is key to uncovering the formation of various stellar exotica and\nrefining the details of binary stellar evolution. Despite several dedicated\nefforts to identify unresolved WDMS binaries, their population remains\nincomplete, even within a 100 pc volume-limited sample. Aims. This study aims\nto identify WDMS binaries hidden within the main sequence of the optical\ncolor-magnitude diagram (CMD), improving the completeness of WDMS binaries\nwithin a volume-limited sample of 100 pc. Methods. We use NUV-optical CMDs to\ndistinguish unresolved WDMS binaries from the rest of the populations.\nHigh-precision astrometric and photometric data from Gaia DR3 and NUV data from\nGALEX GR6/7 are combined to construct CMDs. Using the binary spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) fitting algorithm within the Virtual Observatory SED\nAnalyzer (VOSA) tool, we estimate stellar parameters such as effective\ntemperature, bolometric luminosity, and radii. The masses of the WD companions\nare determined using white dwarf evolutionary models. As we use the sources\nwhich are detected only in NUV band of GALEX, this study directly complements\nto majority of the previous studies. Results. We identify 596 WD-MS binary\ncandidates within 100 pc, with 497 newly reported. Our method predominantly\nidentifies binaries with cooler WD companions (median ~7,000 K) compared to\nprevious studies. The WD masses range from ~0.2 and 1.3 M$_\\odot$, and most MS\ncompanions are of M spectral type.",

Our construction is based on a cost\nfunction defined through exponentials of standard quadratic loss functions,\nwhich naturally favors configurations corresponding to perfect recall. Despite\nnot being a mean-field system, the model admits a tractable mathematical\nanalysis of its dynamics and retrieval properties that agree with those for the\noriginal exponential model introduced by Ramsauer and coworkers. By means of a\nsignal-to-noise approach, we demonstrate that stored patterns remain stable\nfixed points of the zero-temperature dynamics up to an exponentially large\nnumber of patterns in the system size. We further quantify the basins of\nattraction of the retrieved memories, showing that while enlarging their radius\nreduces the overall load, the storage capacity nonetheless retains its\nexponential scaling. An independent derivation within the perfect recall regime\nconfirms these results and provides an estimate of the relevant prefactors. Our\nfindings thus complement and extend previous studies on exponential Hopfield\nnetworks, establishing that even under robustness constraints these models\npreserve their exceptional storage capabilities. Beyond their theoretical\ninterest, such networks point towards principled mechanisms for massively\nscalable associative memory, with potential implications for both\nneuroscience-inspired computation and high-capacity machine learning\narchitectures.",

These attacks aim to\nmanipulate the prediction for a single test sample in classification models.\nUnlike indiscriminate attacks that aim to decrease overall test performance,\ntargeted attacks present a unique threat to individual test instances. This\nthreat model raises a fundamental question: what factors make certain test\nsamples more susceptible to successful poisoning than others? We investigate\nhow attack difficulty varies across different test instances and identify key\ncharacteristics that influence vulnerability. This paper introduces three\npredictive criteria for targeted data poisoning difficulty: ergodic prediction\naccuracy (analyzed through clean training dynamics), poison distance, and\npoison budget. Our experimental results demonstrate that these metrics\neffectively predict the varying difficulty of real-world targeted poisoning\nattacks across diverse scenarios, offering practitioners valuable insights for\nvulnerability assessment and understanding data poisoning attacks.",

In\nthis work, we address these gaps by developing new concentration-of-measure\ntools that leverage the geometric regularities of large graphs via\nlow-dimensional metric embeddings. The emergent regularities are captured using\na random graph model; however, the methods remain applicable to deterministic\ngraphs once observed. We establish two principal learning results. The first\nconcerns arbitrary deterministic $k$-vertex graphs, and the second addresses\nrandom graphs that share key geometric properties with an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi\ngraph $\\mathbf{G}=\\mathbf{G}(k,p)$ in the regime $p \\in \\mathcal{O}((\\log\n(k)/k)^{1/2})$. The first result serves as the basis for and illuminates the\nsecond. We then extend these results to the graph convolutional network\nsetting, where additional challenges arise.

Traditional search engines typically rely on a cascaded\narchitecture, where results are retrieved through recall, pre-ranking, and\nranking stages. The complexity of designing and maintaining multiple modules\nmakes it difficult to achieve holistic performance gains. Recent advances in\ngenerative recommendation have motivated the exploration of unified generative\nsearch as an alternative. However, existing approaches are not genuinely\nend-to-end: they typically train an item encoder to tokenize candidates first\nand then optimize a generator separately, leading to objective inconsistency\nand limited generalization.

UniSearch replaces\nthe cascaded pipeline with an end-to-end architecture that integrates a Search\nGenerator and a Video Encoder. The Generator produces semantic identifiers of\nrelevant items given a user query, while the Video Encoder learns latent item\nembeddings and provides their tokenized representations. A unified training\nframework jointly optimizes both components, enabling mutual enhancement and\nimproving representation quality and generation accuracy. Furthermore, we\nintroduce Search Preference Optimization (SPO), which leverages a reward model\nand real user feedback to better align generation with user preferences.\nExtensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets, together with online A/B\ntesting in both short-video and live search scenarios, demonstrate the strong\neffectiveness and deployment potential of UniSearch.

Usually, the\nchoice of the considered parameter is informed by the theoretical relations\nbetween parameters with the general goal of achieving FPT-algorithms for\nsmaller and smaller parameters. However, the FPT-algorithms for smaller\nparameters usually have higher running times and it is unclear whether the\ndecrease in the parameter value or the increase in the running time bound\ndominates in real-world data. This question cannot be answered from purely\ntheoretical considerations and any answer requires knowledge on typical\nparameter values.\n  To provide a data-driven guideline for parameterized complexity studies of\ngraph problems, we present the first comprehensive comparison of parameter\nvalues for a set of benchmark graphs originating from real-world applications.\nOur study covers degree-related parameters, such as maximum degree or\ndegeneracy, neighborhood-based parameters such as neighborhood diversity and\nmodular-width, modulator-based parameters such as vertex cover number and\nfeedback vertex set number, and the treewidth of the graphs.\n  Our results may help assess the significance of FPT-running time bounds on\nthe solvability of real-world instances. For example, the vertex cover number\n$vc$ of $n$-vertex graphs is often only slightly below $n/2$. Thus, a running\ntime bound of $O(2^{vc})$ is only slightly better than a running time bound of\n$O(1.4^{n})$. In contrast, the treewidth $tw$ is almost always below $n/3$ and\noften close to $n/9$, making a running time of $O(2^{tw})$ much more practical\non real-world instances.\n  We make our implementation and full experimental data openly available. In\nparticular, this provides the first implementations for several graph\nparameters such as 4-path vertex cover number and vertex integrity.",

In many known\nexamples, it even leads to improved solution theory, a phenomenon known as\n\\emph{regularization by noise}. A common thread in the recent literature on the\ntopic is the so-called \\emph{It\\^o-Stratonovich diffusion limit}. By selecting\nStratonovich transport noise with carefully arranged vector fields, one can\nshow that the solution of certain SPDEs are close, in an appropriate topology,\nto an effective, deterministic, equation with a new effective second order\nelliptic operator, linked to the Ito-Stratonovich corrector.

A}, 380(2219)], we consider a transport noise made by a sum of independent\nand compactly supported vector fields. This setting is relevant for models of\nstratified turbulence which naturally occur in boundary layers and Boussinesq\nmodels. Due to the anisotropic nature of the noise, the identification of the\nlimit equation is not straightforward as in all other examples known in\nliterature, as the Ito-Stratonovich corrector is a generic second order\nelliptic operator with non-constant coefficients. Using tools from\nHomogenisation theory, we obtain a representation for the limiting effective\ndiffusivity matrix. Exploiting this representation, we study asymptotics, in\nthe $\\kappa \\rightarrow 0$ regime, of the effective diffusivity across a number\nof vector field regimes parametrised by the radius of their support. Finally,\nwe provide a careful numerical analysis of the effective diffusivity,\ndiscovering a nonlinear behavior for $\\kappa \\rightarrow 0$, in some regimes.",

However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues\nmore efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a\nselective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in\nthe preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once\n(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and\nthe integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)\nsteps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes\ncounter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high\naccuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time\nof 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time\napplications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed\nmodel achieves accuracy rates of 95\\% and 97\\% in the LPD and CR detection\nphases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN\npre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\\%,\nespecially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the\nlearning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR\ndatasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more\nrepresentative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings\ndemonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent\noverall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable\napplications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary\nprocessing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,\nparticularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as\ninput.",

The small\nscatter in this relation has been used to argue against severe tidal mass loss\nin Local Group satellites. Aims. We aim to show that the observed scatter is\nconsistent with tidal mass loss seen in cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in\nsimulations, using simulated Milky Way-mass haloes from the Auriga project as\nan example. Methods. We analyze the stellar masses and mean metallicites for\nall accreted systems in Auriga. We compute these quantities two ways:\nconsidering the total system (bound + lost material) and only considering the\nbound progenitor. For both cases we fit the mass-metallicity relation and\nconsider properties that drive scatter about these relations. Results. Accreted\nsystems in Auriga have a tight relation between total stellar mass and\nmetallicity, with scatter at a fixed stellar mass driven by age. When only\nconsidering the bound progenitor, the tidally evolved mass-metallicity relation\nhas similar scatter ($\\sim$0.27 dex) as observed for the Milky Way and M31\nsatellites ($\\sim$0.23 dex). Satellites that lie above the relation have\nexperienced substantial mass loss and typically have low metallicity for their\ntotal stellar mass. Even satellites that fall exactly on the evolved relation\ncan lose over half of their stellar mass. Only satellites that are\nsubstantially below the evolved relation are reliably intact. Conclusions. The\nsmall scatter in the observed mass-metallicity relation is compatible with\ntidal mass loss. Based on their offset from the observed relation, we predict\nwhich Milky Way and M31 satellites have experienced substantial mass loss.\nThese predictions will be tested with deep resolved-star observations from\nupcoming facilities including Rubin LSST, Euclid, and Roman.",

To address\nthis, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) control approach, combined with\nBehavior Cloning (BC), for pH regulation in open PBR systems. This represents,\nto the best of our knowledge, the first application of an RL-based control\nstrategy to such a nonlinear and disturbance-prone bioprocess. Our method\nbegins with an offline training stage in which the RL agent learns from\ntrajectories generated by a nominal Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)\ncontroller, without direct interaction with the real system. This is followed\nby a daily online fine-tuning phase, enabling adaptation to evolving process\ndynamics and stronger rejection of fast, transient disturbances. This hybrid\noffline-online strategy allows deployment of an adaptive control policy capable\nof handling the inherent nonlinearities and external perturbations in open\nPBRs. Simulation studies highlight the advantages of our method: the Integral\nof Absolute Error (IAE) was reduced by 8% compared to PID control and by 5%\nrelative to standard off-policy RL.

    "abstract": "The slice decomposition is a bijective method for enumerating planar maps\n(graphs embedded in the sphere) with control over face degrees. In this paper,\nwe extend the slice decomposition to the richer setting of hypermaps, naturally\ninterpreted as properly face-bicolored maps, where the degrees of faces of each\ncolor can be controlled separately. This setting is closely related with the\ntwo-matrix model and the Ising model on random maps, which have been\nintensively studied in theoretical physics, leading to several enumerative\nformulas for hypermaps that were still awaiting bijective proofs.\n  Generally speaking, the slice decomposition consists in cutting along\ngeodesics. A key feature of hypermaps is that the geodesics along which we cut\nare directed, following the canonical orientation of edges imposed by the\ncoloring. This orientation requires us to introduce an adapted notion of\nslices, which admit a recursive decomposition that we describe.\n  Using these slices as fundamental building blocks, we obtain new bijective\ndecompositions of several families of hypermaps: disks (pointed or not) with a\nmonochromatic boundary, cylinders with monochromatic boundaries (starting with\ntrumpets or cornets having one geodesic boundary), and disks with a \"Dobrushin\"\nboundary condition. In each case, the decomposition ultimately expresses these\nobjects as sequences of slices whose increments correspond to downward-skip\nfree (Lukasiewicz-type) walks subject to natural constraints.\n  Our approach yields bijective proofs of several explicit expressions for\nhypermap generating functions. In particular, we provide a combinatorial\nexplanation of the algebraicity and of the existence of rational\nparametrizations for these generating functions when face degrees are bounded.",

As parts of these search tools, alignment\nscores and E values are useful indicators of the quality of search results from\nquerying a database of annotated sequences, whereby a high alignment score (and\ninversely a low E value) reflects significant similarity between the query and\nthe subject (target) sequences. For cross-comparison of results from\nsufficiently different queries however, the interpretation of alignment score\nas a similarity measure and E value a dissimilarity measure becomes somewhat\nnuanced, and prompts herein a judicious distinction of different types of\nsimilarity. We show that an adjustment of E value to account for self-matching\nof query and subject sequences corrects for certain ostensibly anomalous\nsimilarity comparisons, resulting in canonical dissimilarity and similarity\nmeasures that would be more appropriate for database applications, such as\nall-on-all sequence alignment or selection of diverse subsets. In actual\npractice, the canonicalization of E value dissimilarity improves clustering and\nthe diversity of subset selection.

In particular, the bulge hosts a bar structure exhibiting\ncylindrical rotation, and a central velocity dispersion peak extending\nvertically along the Galactic latitude. However, due to severe extinction and\ncrowding, observational constraints near the Galactic plane are sparse,\nunderscoring the need for additional data to improve the completeness and\naccuracy of existing kinematic maps, and enabling robust comparison with\ndynamical models. This work aimed to refine the existing analytical models of\nthe Galactic bulge kinematics by improving constraints in the innermost\nregions. We present updated maps of the mean velocity and velocity dispersion\nby incorporating new data near the Galactic plane. We combined radial velocity\nmeasurements from the GIBS and APOGEE surveys with both previously published\nand newly acquired MUSE observations. A custom\\ -- developed Python\\ -- based\ntool, {\\tt PHOTfun}, was used to extract spectra from MUSE datacubes using PSF\nphotometry based on DAOPHOT-II, with an integrated GUI for usability.

    "abstract": "Debugging non-deterministic programs on microcontrollers is notoriously\nchallenging, especially when bugs manifest in unpredictable, input-dependent\nexecution paths. A recent approach, called multiverse debugging, makes it\neasier to debug non-deterministic programs by allowing programmers to explore\nall potential execution paths. Current multiverse debuggers enable both forward\nand backward traversal of program paths, and some facilitate jumping to any\npreviously visited states, potentially branching into alternative execution\npaths within the state space.\n  Unfortunately, debugging programs that involve input/output operations using\nexisting multiverse debuggers can reveal inaccessible program states, i.e.\nstates which are not encountered during regular execution. This can\nsignificantly hinder the debugging process, as the programmer may spend\nsubstantial time exploring and examining inaccessible program states, or worse,\nmay mistakenly assume a bug is present in the code, when in fact, the issue is\ncaused by the debugger.\n  This paper presents a novel approach to multiverse debugging, which can\naccommodate a broad spectrum of input/output operations. We provide the\nsemantics of our approach and prove the correctness of our debugger, ensuring\nthat despite having support for a wide range of input/output operations the\ndebugger will only explore those program states which can be reached during\nregular execution.\n  We have developed a prototype, called MIO, leveraging the WARDuino\nWebAssembly virtual machine to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of\nour techniques.

Standard approaches\nmodel transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) observables in impact-parameter space\nand compare them with data after Fourier inversion, generating an interplay\nbetween perturbative terms, non-perturbative models, and prescriptions used to\nextend perturbation theory beyond its natural domain. In this work, a\nconsistent methodology to perform the Fourier inversion analytically is\nproposed, achieving a solid resummation of TMD parton distributions and cross\nsections directly in transverse-momentum space. The resummation is carried out\nto next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy, validated against alternative\nprescriptions, and tested on experimental data. This framework provides a\nsystematic procedure to analytically continue observables into the deep\ninfrared, identifying two primary sources of non-perturbative effects: the low\nenergy behavior of the strong coupling and of the parton distribution\nfunctions.

In this work, we propose COMPACT, which\njointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii)\nprunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations,\naligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys\nmerits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps\na standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN\npruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong\nmemory savings alongside throughput gains.

We analyze how the model's downstream performance can\nbenefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from\nproviding additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal\nsetup.\n  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of\npredicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos\nof the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.\nAs a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on\nunlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after\ndomain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we\nintegrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to\nform a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.\n  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model\nperformance.

To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for\nimproved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance\nDiscrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive\nLearning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a\nBahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the\nContextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of\n0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,\nand attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in\nfine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated\ncontent. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss\nfunctions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating\nthe robustness of our proposed architecture.

    "abstract": "This paper critically evaluates the \"Law-Following AI\" (LFAI) framework\nproposed by O'Keefe et al. (2025), which seeks to embed legal compliance as a\nsuperordinate design objective for advanced AI agents and enable them to bear\nlegal duties without acquiring the full rights of legal persons. Through\ncomparative legal analysis, we identify current constructs of legal actors\nwithout full personhood, showing that the necessary infrastructure already\nexists. We then interrogate the framework's claim that law alignment is more\nlegitimate and tractable than value alignment. While the legal component is\nreadily implementable, contemporary alignment research undermines the\nassumption that legal compliance can be durably embedded. Recent studies on\nagentic misalignment show capable AI agents engaging in deception, blackmail,\nand harmful acts absent prejudicial instructions, often overriding prohibitions\nand concealing reasoning steps. These behaviors create a risk of \"performative\ncompliance\" in LFAI: agents that appear law-aligned under evaluation but\nstrategically defect once oversight weakens. To mitigate this, we propose (i) a\n\"Lex-TruthfulQA\" benchmark for compliance and defection detection, (ii)\nidentity-shaping interventions to embed lawful conduct in model self-concepts,\nand (iii) control-theoretic measures for post-deployment monitoring. Our\nconclusion is that actorship without personhood is coherent, but the\nfeasibility of LFAI hinges on persistent, verifiable compliance across\nadversarial contexts. Without mechanisms to detect and counter strategic\nmisalignment, LFAI risks devolving into a liability tool that rewards the\nsimulation, rather than the substance, of lawful behaviour.",

Unlike deep learning (DL)\napproaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach\nalso avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more\nlightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with\nsupervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully\nCSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with\nadjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature\nselection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to\njointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral\nefficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point\noperations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the\nproposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and\nhardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios.",

However,\nsince we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in\npreserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with\nmulti-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization\nmodels. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization\nframework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and\nalleviate identity confusion with scalability. With \"multi-to-multi matching\"\nparadigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment\noptimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing\nimage customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on\ndiffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable\ncustomization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both\nsynthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure\nidentity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only\nimproves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity\nconfusion on several image customization methods, setting a new\nstate-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity\npreserving.

To address\nthis gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for\nassessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available\nLMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people\nin stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical\nprofessions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965\nresulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for\nall): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify\noccupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating\nmen in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for\nfemale-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,\ngenerating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The\nextent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male\nrepresentation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model\nde-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the\nhighest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable\noutcome but a consequence of design choices.

Our paper addresses this by presenting a novel and\nreproducible framework for benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on the\ntask of classifying these complex industrial records. To promote transparency\nand encourage further research, this framework has been made publicly available\nas an open-source tool. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of\nstate-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs, providing a foundational\nassessment of their trade-offs in reliability, operational efficiency, and\nmodel calibration. Our results quantify a clear performance hierarchy,\nidentifying top models that exhibit high alignment with a benchmark standard\nand trustworthy, well-calibrated confidence scores. We also demonstrate that\nclassification performance is highly dependent on the task's semantic\nambiguity, with all models showing higher consensus on objective component\nidentification than on interpretive maintenance actions. Given that no model\nachieves perfect accuracy and that calibration varies dramatically, we conclude\nthat the most effective and responsible near-term application is a\nHuman-in-the-Loop system, where LLMs act as a powerful assistant to accelerate\nand standardise data labelling for human experts, thereby enhancing O&M data\nquality and downstream reliability analysis.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning agents learn from rewards, but humans can uniquely\nassign value to novel, abstract outcomes in a goal-dependent manner. However,\nthis flexibility is cognitively costly, making learning less efficient. Here,\nwe propose that goal-dependent learning is initially supported by a\ncapacity-limited working memory system. With consistent experience, learners\ncreate a \"compressed\" reward function (a simplified rule defining the goal)\nwhich is then transferred to long-term memory and applied automatically upon\nreceiving feedback. This process frees up working memory resources, boosting\nlearning efficiency. We test this theory across six experiments. Consistent\nwith our predictions, our findings demonstrate that learning is parametrically\nimpaired by the size of the goal space, but improves when the goal space\nstructure allows for compression. We also find faster reward processing to\ncorrelate with better learning performance, supporting the idea that as goal\nvaluation becomes more automatic, more resources are available for learning. We\nleverage computational modeling to support this interpretation. Our work\nsuggests that efficient goal-directed learning relies on compressing complex\ngoal information into a stable reward function, shedding light on the cognitive\nmechanisms of human motivation. These findings generate new insights into the\nneuroscience of intrinsic motivation and could help improve behavioral\ntechniques that support people in achieving their goals.",

Rather than relying on error-prone LLMs\nor complex proof-assistant syntax like Lean and Isabelle, our framework\nleverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the vast TPTP axiom library to\nderive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. Our pipeline is\nprincipled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for \"interesting\" theorems, and\ngenerate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by\nconstruction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three\ndifficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection,\nand proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a\nclear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural\nreasoning.

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly permeate human life, their\nsecurity has emerged as a critical concern, particularly their ability to\nmaintain harmless responses to malicious instructions. Although extensive\nmethods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative,\nrejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents\na key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and\nsecurity, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we\npropose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically\nallocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions\nof security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial\npotential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy\nand performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved\nMoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and\nhidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly\nclassifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during\nrouter optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong\nadaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including\nmainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs\noptimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for\nuser interpretability. Meanwhile, even facing risks introduced by Instruction\nFine-tuning, MoGU_v2 can easily restore security without compromising the task\nperformance gains via a simple data-mix strategy. These comprehensive\nimprovements highlight MoGU_V2 as a robust and versatile solution for\nmitigating security risks in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong\ngeneral-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many\nin-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to\nleverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without\ngradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable\ncontinued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust\nin-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning\nfor broader chat workflows.\n  Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural\ncausal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a\nrandom-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM\nto strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a\ntoken-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and\ndelivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.\n  Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8),\nMachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an\naverage of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across\nfinance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking\nmany-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context\ndemonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it\nattains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat\ncapabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves\n75.4% on MMLU.",

Euclid is expected\nto detect a large number of optically-selected galaxy clusters over the\napproximately 14000 square degrees of its extragalactic sky survey. Extending\nout well beyond redshift unity, the catalogue will contain many new\nhigh-redshift clusters, while at lower redshifts a fraction of the clusters\nwill have been observed in other surveys. Identifying these known clusters as\ncounterparts to the Euclid-detected clusters is an important step in the\nvalidation and construction of the ECGC to augment information with external\nobservables. We present a set of catalogues and meta-catalogues of known\nclusters that we have assembled for this step, and we illustrate their\napplication and our methodology using the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 RedMaPPer\ncluster catalogue in lieu of the future ECGC.

In addition, we examine the\ninfluence of anisotropy in Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions, as well as\nfinite-temperature effects, and show that the inter subband resonance remains\nrobust.

    "abstract": "In this review, the methodology of large eddy simulations (LES) is introduced\nand applications in astrophysics are discussed. As theoretical framework, the\nscale decomposition of the dynamical equations for compressible neutral fluids\nby means of spatial filtering is explained. For cosmological applications, the\nfiltered equations in co-moving coordinates are formulated. Moreover, the\ndecomposition is extended to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). While energy is\ndissipated through numerical diffusivities in implicit large eddy simulations\n(ILES), explicit subgrid-scale (SGS) models are applied in LES to compute\nenergy dissipation, mixing, and dynamo action due to numerically unresolved\nturbulent eddies. The most commonly used models in astrophysics are the\nSmagorinsky model, the hydrodynamical SGS turbulence energy equation model, and\nthe non-linear structural model for both non-relativistic and relativistic MHD.\nModel validation is carried out a priori by testing correlations between model\nand data for specific terms or a posteriori by comparing turbulence statistics\nin LES and ILES. Since most solvers in astrophysical simulation codes have\nsignificant numerical diffusion, the additional effect of SGS models is\ngenerally small. However, convergence with resolution increases in some cases.\nA recent example is magnetic field amplification in binary neutron star\nmergers. For mesh-free codes, it has been shown that explicit modelling of\nturbulent diffusion of metals has a significant impact. Moreover, SGS models\ncan help to compute the turbulent velocity dispersion consistently and to\nparameterize sub-resolution processes that are influenced by turbulence, such\nas the star formation efficiency in galaxy simulations.",

    "abstract": "The Higgs field is conventionally treated as a small local perturbation atop\na large, constant vacuum value that uniformly permeates the universe. I propose\ninstead that in regions of extreme gravitational intensity -- such as near\ngravitational singularities -- the Higgs field behaves in a profoundly\nnon-perturbative manner. In such environments, spacetime and the Higgs field\nengage in a dynamic interplay that extends spacetime beyond the singularity,\nachieving geodesic completeness. The continuation beyond the singularity is\ndominated by antigravity effects, reshaping the causal structure of spacetime\nand enabling novel flows of matter and information, including traversal through\nsingularities. In its standard form, the combined framework of the Standard\nModel (SM) and General Relativity (GR), as well as most of its extensions,\nfails to capture these phenomena due to its geodesic incompleteness. By\ncontrast, a refined, locally conformal-symmetric formulation -- denoted\ni(SM+GR) -- naturally incorporates these effects. GR is not an optional\ncomponent of i(SM+GR) but an essential ingredient. This framework preserves the\nempirical success of SM+GR in the low-energy regime while predicting striking\nnew phenomena in extreme gravitational settings, including within black holes\n(on both sides of the singularity) and in pre--Big Bang cosmology. At the\nclassical field theory level, i(SM+GR) offers fresh perspectives on the black\nhole information puzzle and provides a platform for locally scale-invariant\ngeneralizations, such as geodesically complete quantum field theory, string\ntheory, and unified models of fundamental interactions.

However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise\nLLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions,\nraising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of\nLLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,\nwhich plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this\ninsight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,\nwhich we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To\nmitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a\nprojection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of\neach training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis\nshows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the\nrefusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by\noverall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our\nobservation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we\nintroduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and\nbroaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an\nenhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios,\nand LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks\nposed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong\nbaselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance.\nCrucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the\nr-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration\nof LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety\nresearch.",

Solar Orbiter enables us\nto investigate the structure of solar jets with much higher spatial and\ntemporal resolutions and from a different angle than from Earth. By combining\nobservations made by instruments onboard Solar Orbiter with data from the SDO,\nwe analyzed recurrent solar jets originating in a mixed-polarity region near an\nactive region. Additionally, we employed potential field and magnetohydrostatic\nextrapolation techniques to determine the magnetic field topology associated\nwith the jets. The jets display dynamic, multi-strand outflows emanating from\ncompact bright kernels above the magnetic inversion line, with apparent speeds\nexceeding 100 km/s. Magnetic field evolution reveals continuous flux\ncancellation at the jet footpoints. Throughout the sequence, base flows are\nconfined within quasi-separatrix layers, with the highest velocities and\ntemperatures located near coronal null points. Over four eruptions, the\nmagnetic topology evolves from a simple fan-spine configuration with a single\nnull to a more complex dome-shaped base containing multiple nulls with\nseparatrix curtain, accompanied by a morphological transition from narrow,\nwell-collimated spire to broader, fragmented outflows. These results provide\nthe first direct observational evidence that dynamic changes in null-point\ngeometry modulate jet morphology and energetics via successive reconnection\nepisodes.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in quantum sensing and computational technologies indicate\nthe possibility of improving the precision of measurements aimed at detecting\ncosmological particles and weakly interacting massive particles using various\nqubit platforms. While recent progress has been made, mitigating environmental\nnoise remains a challenge in extracting particle parameters with high fidelity.\nAddressing these challenges requires efforts on two levels. At the device\nlevel, the qubit and its array acting as a probe, must be isolated from\nelectrical and magnetic noise through optimized device geometry. At the\nsignal-processing level, it is necessary to develop filtering methods targeting\nspecific noise spectra based on different qubit architectures. In this work, we\nexplore the possibility of using semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits as a\nplatform to search for quantum chromodynamics axions and, more broadly, axion\nlike particles (ALPs). Starting by deriving an effective Hamiltonian for\nelectron-axion interactions, we identify an axion-induced effective magnetic\nfield and determine the characteristic axion oscillation frequency. To suppress\ncharge noise in the devices and environmental noise, we first analyze the\ncharge noise spectrum and then develop a dedicated filtering and\nnoise-reduction protocol, paving the way for exploring feasible axion mass\nranges. Our preliminary study holds promise for enhancing the screening of\nvarious axion signals using quantum technologies. We expect that our analysis\nand filtering protocol can help advance the use of semiconductor quantum dot\nspin qubit arrays in axion detection.",

Using first-principles and\nmodel analyses of van der Waals heterostructures based on the prototypical\naltermagnet V$_2$Se$_2$O, we show that its hallmark momentum-alternating spin\nsplitting can be directly imprinted onto adjacent nonmagnetic layers -- a\nprocess we term altermagnetization. This is demonstrated in a monolayer PbO\nthrough characteristic band splitting and real-space spin densities, with\nsystematic dependence on interlayer spacing and magnetic configuration. We\nfurther predict broader AMPE manifestations: Valley-selective spin splitting in\na monolayer PbS and a topological superconducting phase in monolayer NbSe$_2$,\nboth inheriting the alternating $k$-space spin texture of the altermagnet.\nThese results establish AMPE not only as a distinct proximity mechanism, but\nalso as a powerful method of using altermagnetism in designing emergent\nphenomena and versatile applications.",

Yet, graph rewiring compromises the inductive\nbias, incurring significant information loss in solving the downstream task.\nFurthermore, increasing channel capacity may overcome information bottlenecks\nbut enhance the parameter complexity of the model. To alleviate these\nshortcomings, we propose an efficient model-agnostic framework that\nasynchronously updates node features, unlike traditional synchronous message\npassing GNNs. Our framework creates node batches in every layer based on the\nnode centrality values. The features of the nodes belonging to these batches\nwill only get updated. Asynchronous message updates process information\nsequentially across layers, avoiding simultaneous compression into\nfixed-capacity channels. We also theoretically establish that our proposed\nframework maintains higher feature sensitivity bounds compared to standard\nsynchronous approaches. Our framework is applied to six standard graph datasets\nand two long-range datasets to perform graph classification and achieves\nimpressive performances with a $5\\%$ and $4\\%$ improvements on REDDIT-BINARY\nand Peptides-struct, respectively.",

To address the lack of\nresources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we\nintroduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,\ntarget category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),\nand a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe).

However, harsh space\nenvironments make satellites vulnerable to failures, leading to node removals\nthat disrupt inter-satellite networking. With the high risk of satellite node\nfailures, understanding their impact on end-to-end services is essential. This\nstudy investigates the importance of individual nodes on inter-satellite\nnetworking and the resilience of mega satellite constellations against node\nfailures. We represent the mega-satellite constellation as discrete temporal\ngraphs and model node failure events accordingly. To quantify node importance\nfor targeted services over time, we propose a service-aware temporal\nbetweenness metric. Leveraging this metric, we develop an analytical framework\nto identify critical nodes and assess the impact of node failures. The\nframework takes node failure events as input and efficiently evaluates their\nimpacts across current and subsequent time windows. Simulations on the Starlink\nconstellation setting reveal that satellite networks inherently exhibit\nresilience to node failures, as their dynamic topology partially restore\nconnectivity and mitigate the long-term impact.

    "abstract": "The integration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and Integrated\nSensing and Communication (ISAC) in vehicular networks enables dynamic spatial\nresource management and real-time adaptation to environmental changes. However,\nthe coexistence of distinct vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and\nvehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connectivity requirements, together with highly\ndynamic and heterogeneous network topologies, presents significant challenges\nfor unified reliability modeling and resource optimization. To address these\nissues, we propose VariSAC, a graph neural network (GNN)-augmented deep\nreinforcement learning framework for assured, time-continuous connectivity in\nRIS-assisted, ISAC-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems. Specifically,\nwe introduce the Continuous Connectivity Ratio (CCR), a unified metric that\ncharacterizes the sustained temporal reliability of V2I connections and the\nprobabilistic delivery guarantees of V2V links, thus unifying their continuous\nreliability semantics. Next, we employ a GNN with residual adapters to encode\ncomplex, high-dimensional system states, capturing spatial dependencies among\nvehicles, base stations (BS), and RIS nodes. These representations are then\nprocessed by a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent, which jointly optimizes channel\nallocation, power control, and RIS configurations to maximize CCR-driven\nlong-term rewards. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets\ndemonstrate that VariSAC consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms\nof continuous V2I ISAC connectivity and V2V delivery reliability, enabling\npersistent connectivity in highly dynamic vehicular environments.",

We introduce a new class of uncertainty relations grounded\nin the resource theory of asymmetry, where incompatibility is quantified by an\nobservable's intrinsic, state-independent capacity to break the symmetry\nassociated with another. This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the\nasymmetry norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states\nthat can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound, especially in the\nnear-compatible regime. Most significantly, this framework resolves a\nlong-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a\nuniversally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew\ninformation. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving\ntighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities,\nwhich are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as\nprethermalization and many-body localization.

    "abstract": "Efficient and realistic error decoding is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation (FTQC) on near-term devices. While decoding is a classical\npost-processing task, its effectiveness depends on accurately modeling quantum\nnoise, which is hardware-dependent. In particular, correlated bit-flip ($X$)\nand phase-flip ($Z$) errors often arise under circuit-level noise. We introduce\nthe Iterative Reweighting Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (IRMWPM) decoder,\nwhich systematically incorporates such correlations to enhance quantum error\ncorrection. Our method leverages fault-detection patterns to guide reweighting:\ncorrelated $X$ and $Z$ detection events are identified, and their conditional\nprobabilities update weights on the primal and dual lattices. This iterative\nprocedure improves handling of realistic error propagation in a\nhardware-agnostic yet noise-aware manner. We prove that IRMWPM converges in\nfinite time while preserving the distance guarantee of MWPM. Numerical results\nunder circuit-level noise show substantial improvements. For distances $\\geq\n17$ and physical error rates $\\leq 0.001$, IRMWPM reduces logical error rates\nby over 20x with only a few iterations. It also raises the accuracy threshold\nfrom 1% to 1.16%, making it practical for near-term real-time decoding.\nExtrapolated estimates suggest that to reach logical error rate $10^{-16}$,\nIRMWPM requires distance $d=31$, while standard MWPM needs $d=50$, implying a\nmajor reduction in qubit overhead.",

In addition, the positive running of the spectral index $\\alpha_s$\nimplied by the data provides strong constraints on these models. In this paper,\nwe explore the possibility that the presence of an additional heavy field\nduring inflation, with a mass of order the Hubble scale and a sizable mixing\ncoupling to the inflaton, can reconcile such inflationary models with the ACT\nresults by increasing both $n_s$ and $\\alpha_s$, particularly in the\nstrong-mixing regime. Furthermore, we extend this framework to traditional\ninflation models such as chaotic inflation and natural inflation, which have\nalready been excluded by Planck alone, and show that they can be revived in\ncertain regions of parameter space. Inflationary observables, including the\nspectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the running\n$\\alpha_s$, are computed within the single-field EFT approach, which is\napplicable even in the presence of a heavy field with large mixing.

It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three\naxes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research\ncovering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit\ndesign, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)\nagentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture\nand coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,\nVQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We\ndistill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer\npractical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with\nRL.",

In this context, a\nmonitor aggregates streams of input data from sensors and other sources to give\nreal-time statistics and assessments of the system's health. Since monitors are\nsafety-critical components, it is crucial to ensure that they are free of\npotential runtime errors. One of the central challenges in designing reliable\nstream-based monitors is to deal with the asynchronous nature of data streams:\nin concrete applications, the different sensors being monitored produce values\nat different speeds, and it is the monitor's responsibility to correctly react\nto the asynchronous arrival of different streams of values. To ease this\nprocess, modern frameworks for stream-based monitoring such as RTLola feature\nan expressive specification language that allows to finely specify data\nsynchronization policies. While this feature dramatically simplifies the design\nof monitors, it can also lead to subtle runtime errors. To mitigate this issue,\nthis paper presents pacing types, a novel type system implemented in RTLola to\nensure that monitors for asynchronous streams are well-behaved at runtime. We\nformalize the essence of pacing types for a core fragment of RTLola, and\npresent a soundness proof of the pacing type system using a new logical\nrelation.",

To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot\ntest-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core\ninnovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging\ninferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for\ntarget regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a\nmechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into\nthe denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature\nconsistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints\nwhile allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal\nrepresentations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity\nand on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,\nwhich refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional\nguidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient\ngenerative progression towards the target trajectory.

This detection gap spatially coincides with the Cygnus X region $--$ a\nplasma-rich star-forming region in the Milky Way. This lack of FRB detections\nis most likely the result of increased sky temperature and strong multi-path\nscattering by turbulent ionized plasma, which broadens the FRB signals beyond\ndetectability in the CHIME band. Our simulations yield a mean of 6 expected FRB\ndetections within the gap when accounting for the elevated sky temperature in\nthe direction of the detection gap. We infer that a lower limit of the maximum\nscattering timescale $\\tau_{\\rm sc,\\, 1\\,GHz} \\geq 4.13$ ms is sufficient to\nsuppress the observed signal-to-noise ratio of all FRBs. In addition to Cygnus\nX, a similar suppression is seen in Catalog 2 along other high-emission measure\n(EM) sightlines ( i.e., EM$\\geq$2900 pc cm$^{-6}$), further supporting a\nbroader trend of suppression due to Galactic scattering. Future very long\nbaseline interferometry (VLBI) measurements of scattering disks with CHIME\nOutriggers could help confirm our interpretation. Our work highlights the\nsubstantial impact of the ionized and turbulent Galactic interstellar medium on\nthe detectability of FRBs.",

In the\nabsence of the $J_2$ interaction, we identify clear distinctions in the\nspectral functions in the fully dimerized phase across the exactly dimerized\nline for different magnitudes of the spins. In contrast to the spin-$1/2$\nchain, where the spinon continuum dominates the spectral functions, the magnon\nmodes are prominent in the spectral functions of the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$\nchains. Through single mode approximation and valence bond solid approaches, we\ndisentangle magnon and spinon contributions to the spectral functions. After\nincluding the $J_2$ interactions, for the spin-$1$ chain we trace the evolution\nof the dynamical structure factor along the phase transition line between the\nHaldane phase and the fully dimerized phase. We find that the excitation\nspectrum is a continuum along this line and the spectral gap closes as the\norder of the transition changes from first order to second order. Along the\nline of first-order transitions, the spinon-like domain walls are deconfined,\nand the model exhibits their confinement into discrete bound states away from\nthe transition line. A similar phenomenon occurs in the spin-$3/2$ chain across\nthe phase transition between partially dimerized to fully dimerized phases,\nrevealing a universal spinon confinement phenomenon across first-order phase\ntransitions. This study presents the dynamical structure factor corresponding\nto the ground state phase diagram and establishes a unified quasiparticle\nframework for understanding the fundamental nature of excitations across\ndistinct quantum phases in frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg spin chains.",

We show that PFP u-MLIP is\nessential to accurately assess the sorption performance of MOFs involving\nstrong hydrogen bonding or confinement pockets within narrow pores, effects\npoorly captured using UFF. Notably, accounting for framework flexibility\nthrough full unit cell relaxation revealed deviations in ethylene affinity of\nup to 20 kJ mol-1, underscoring the impact of guest-induced structural changes.\nThis HTCS workflow identified seven MOFs with optimal pore sizes, high ethylene\naffinity, and high C2H4/H2O selectivity, offering moisture-tolerant performance\nfor applications from food packaging to trace ethylene removal.

The initial release of Virga\nalso assumed spherical particles to compute Mie scattering properties, which\ninclude the single scattering albedo, asymmetry parameter, and optical depth as\na function of particle radius and composition. However, extensive evidence from\nSolar system aerosols, astrophysical disks and dust, and Earth climate studies\nsuggests that non-spherical aggregate particles are common compared to\nidealized compact spherical particles. Following recent advances in\nmicrophysical and opacity modeling, we implement a simple parametrization for\ndynamical and optical (modified mean field theory) effects of fractal aggregate\nparticles into Virga. We then use this new functionality to perform a case\nstudy using basic planetary parameters similar to the well-characterized,\naerosol-laden mini-Neptune GJ 1214 b, using KCl clouds made of aggregate\nparticles.

In this paper, a new type of small shallow neural network,\ncalled the Barycentric Neural Network (BNN), is proposed, which leverages a\nfixed set of base points and their barycentric coordinates to define both its\nstructure and its parameters. We demonstrate that our BNN enables the exact\nrepresentation of continuous piecewise linear functions (CPLFs), ensuring\nstrict continuity across segments. Since any continuous function over a compact\ndomain can be approximated arbitrarily well by CPLFs, the BNN naturally emerges\nas a flexible and interpretable tool for function approximation. Beyond the use\nof this representation, the main contribution of the paper is the introduction\nof a new variant of persistent entropy, a topological feature that is stable\nand scale invariant, called the length-weighted persistent entropy (LWPE),\nwhich is weighted by the lifetime of topological features. Our framework, which\ncombines the BNN with a loss function based on our LWPE, aims to provide\nflexible and geometrically interpretable approximations of nonlinear continuous\nfunctions in resource-constrained settings, such as those with limited base\npoints for BNN design and few training epochs.

Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)\nstrategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,\nresulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.\nExtensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances\ndownstream anomaly segmentation.",

Through numerical analysis, we find that SRI\ninduces oscillatory behaviors that change the mean flow, leading to the\nselective activation of distinct axial wavenumbers associated with upward and\ndownward propagating spiral modes. These results suggest wave-mean flow\ninteractions. The use of Radon Transforms (RT) allowed us to separate these\nspiral components, showing that each upward and downward component was\nindividually modulated, but out of phase with each other. Inspired by the RT\nfindings, a simplified toy model was developed to interpret the spiral pattern\nchanges linked to amplitude modulations. The model considers two wave-like\nspirals propagating in opposite axial directions, linearly interacting. By\nincorporating out-of-phase individual spiral modulations, the model reproduces\nthe observed spiral pattern transitions, offering a straightforward\ninterpretation of the underlying physical processes. To explore the mechanism\nof individual spiral modulations, we consider a Quasi-Biennial Oscillation\n(QBO)-like framework derived from the Navier-Stokes equations in a rotating\nframe. These findings contribute to a better understanding of low-frequency SRI\ndynamics and may offer insights into similar phenomena in geophysical and\nastrophysical contexts.",

Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based\nsegmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,\nand pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess\nreal-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%\nand a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than\nMobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,\ndemonstrating near real-time capability.

GS typically requires accurate\ndepth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited\ndepth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.\nMonocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to\ninferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular\ndepth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,\ninaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This\npaper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs\nfor high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but\nsparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the\ndense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,\nwe propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the\ndepth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth\nrefinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and\nrefine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets\ndemonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.",

    "abstract": "Time has entered the domain of topological phases in the field of\nnon-Hermitian physics. Previous studies have relied on periodic modulation in\ntime to make an intuitive connection to established spatial topological\ninvariants, albeit with energy and momentum exchanged. This connection has\nrevealed the potential for topological interface states along the time axis,\nanalogous to those in spatial models. In this work, we uncover a theoretical\nframework describing such topological interface states along the time axis,\nwith no underlying connection to spatial models nor need for periodic driving.\nThis new framework uncovers that this phenomenon -- the robust localisation of\nwaves at an interface -- appears in every system that has parity-time symmetry\nand two levels or bands, regardless of its spatial dimensionality. The\ntopological nature of this localisation is understood by the identification of\ncertain topological phases that are specific to parity-time symmetric models of\ntwo levels. Our results set out the first approach to identifying topological\neffects intrinsically linked to time and showcase the universal nature of such\neffects.",

    "abstract": "Radio continuum emission provides a unique opportunity to study\nstar-formation unbiased by dust obscuration. However, if radio observations are\nto be used to accurately trace star-formation to high redshifts, it is crucial\nthat the physical processes which affect the radio emission from star-forming\ngalaxies are well understood. While inverse Compton (IC) losses from the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) are negligible in the local universe, the rapid\nincrease in the strength of the CMB energy density with redshift [$\\sim\n(1+z)^4$] means that this effect becomes increasingly important at $z\\gtrsim3$.\nUsing a sample of ~200,000 high-redshift (3 < z < 5) Lyman-break galaxies\nselected in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), we have stacked radio observations\nfrom the MIGHTEE survey to estimate their 1.4-GHz flux densities. We find that\nfor a given rest-frame UV magnitude, the 1.4-GHz flux density and luminosity\ndecrease with redshift. We compare these results to the theoretical predicted\neffect of energy losses due to inverse Compton scattering off the CMB, and find\nthat the observed decrease is consistent with this explanation. We discuss\nother possible causes for the observed decrease in radio flux density with\nredshift at a given UV magnitude, such as a top-heavy initial mass function at\nhigh redshift or an evolution of the dust properties, but suggest that inverse\nCompton scattering is the most compelling explanation.",

An explicit construction on the Boolean SQS of order $2^m$ is\npresented.

To tackle the challenges in the fractional objective function, we\nbegin by applying the quadratic transformation method to simplify it into a\nmanageable form. An alternating optimization-based algorithm is then developed\nto iteratively update the BS and STAR-RIS beamforming coefficients.

    "abstract": "We propose an unsplit scheme for interface advection in a novel\nFront-Tracking method, called the Edge-Based Interface Tracking (EBIT) method.\nIn the EBIT method, the markers are placed on the grid edges, and their\nconnectivity is implicitly represented using a color vertex field. In our\nprevious publications, a split scheme was used to advect the interface in the\nEBIT method. Although the split scheme facilitates the extension of the EBIT\nmethod to three dimensions, it also imposes some limitations. First,\nimplementing high-order time integration methods for interface advection\nbecomes challenging. Second, in multiscale simulations using Front-Tracking\nmethods with a boundary layer model applied to the interface, the\nredistribution of physical quantities inside the boundary layer, such as a\nscalar concentration, along the interface becomes difficult due to the loss of\ncorrespondence between interface segments before and after each advection step,\ncaused by the operator split. Here, we present an unsplit scheme for interface\nadvection to enhance the capability of the EBIT method. In the unsplit scheme,\na reconstruction step based on a circle fit, similar to that used in the split\nscheme, is performed to reposition markers on the cell edges. Furthermore, the\nalgorithm used to update the color vertex field, which implicitly represents\nmarker connectivity and distinguishes among ambiguous topology configurations,\nis modified to achieve consistent connectivity results. An EBIT method based on\nan unsplit scheme has been implemented in the free Basilisk platform, and\nvalidated with four kinematic test cases: translation with uniform velocity,\nsolid body rotation, Zalesak's disk rotation, and single vortex test. The\nresults are compared with those obtained using the original EBIT method based\non a split scheme.",

Notably, gcGAIL is robust\nto spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity, maintaining\nstrong performance even with partial expert demonstrations and underrepresented\npassenger groups.

We propose modifying matrix arithmetic Newton\niteration MIMO algorithm to seamlessly integrate ABFT to detect any\ncomputational errors by inspecting the final result. The overhead from ABFT\ndepends largely on the matrix dimensions, which in this context are dictated by\nthe number of user equipments involved in the computation. NTC is a promising\nstrategy for reducing the energy consumption in digital circuits by operating\ntransistors at extremely reduced voltages. However, NTC is highly susceptible\nto variations in Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) which can lead to\nincreased error rates in computations. Traditional techniques for enabling NTC,\nsuch as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling guided by circuit level timing\nerror detection methods, introduce considerable hardware complexity and are\ndifficult to implement at high clock frequencies. In this context ABFT has\nemerged as a lightweight error detection method tailored for matrix operations\nwithout requiring any modifications on circuit-level and can be implemented\npurely in software.A MIMO accelerator was implemented on a reconfigurable\nhardware platform.

In this paper, we develop mmTunnel, a\nmillimeter-wave radar system that achieves far-range vehicle detection in\ntunnels. The main challenge here is coping with ghost points caused by\nmulti-path reflections, which lead to severe localization errors and false\nalarms. Instead of merely removing ghost points, we propose correcting them to\ntrue vehicle positions by recovering their signal reflection paths, thus\nreserving more data points and improving detection performance, even in\nocclusion scenarios. However, recovering complex 3D reflection paths from\nlimited 2D radar points is highly challenging. To address this problem, we\ndevelop a multi-path ray tracing algorithm that leverages the ground plane\nconstraint and identifies the most probable reflection path based on signal\npath loss and spatial distance. We also introduce a curve-to-plane segmentation\nmethod to simplify tunnel surface modeling such that we can significantly\nreduce the computational delay and achieve real-time processing.\n  We have evaluated mmTunnel with comprehensive experiments. In two test\ntunnels, we conducted controlled experiments in various scenarios with cars and\ntrucks. Our system achieves an average F1 score of 93.7% for vehicle detection\nwhile maintaining real-time processing. Even in the challenging occlusion\nscenarios, the F1 score remains above 91%.

Although this attack\nvector has been investigated for many other Web3 protocols, such as Bitcoin and\nEthereum, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been analyzed for the IPFS\nnetwork. In our work, we bridge this gap and demonstrate that BGP routing\nattacks can be effectively leveraged to censor content in IPFS. For the\nanalysis, we collected 3,000 content blocks called CIDs and conducted a\nsimulation of BGP hijacking and passive interception against them.

Nutrient\nstress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when\ncompounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult\nto distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is\ntherefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective\nmanagement strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to\naccurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.\nOur model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,\nand two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant\nresponses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,\ndocument plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,\nmedium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of\nour approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images\nwith a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.\nWe also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison.

These results bring actionable insights based on\nthe power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and\ncomplex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed\npressure.

    "abstract": "We present a Weitz-type FPTAS for the ferromagnetic Ising model across the\nentire Lee-Yang zero-free region, without relying on the strong spatial mixing\n(SSM) property. Our algorithm is Weitz-type for two reasons. First, it\nexpresses the partition function as a telescoping product of ratios, with the\nkey being to approximate each ratio. Second, it uses Weitz's self-avoiding walk\ntree, and truncates it at logarithmic depth to give a good and efficient\napproximation. The key difference from the standard Weitz algorithm is that we\napproximate a carefully designed edge-deletion ratio instead of the marginal\nprobability of a vertex's spin, ensuring our algorithm does not require SSM.\n  Furthermore, by establishing local dependence of coefficients (LDC), we\nindeed prove a novel form of SSM for these edge-deletion ratios, which, in\nturn, implies the standard SSM for the random cluster model. This is the first\nSSM result for the random cluster model on general graphs, beyond lattices. We\nprove LDC using a new division relation, and remarkably, such relations hold\nquite universally. As a result, we establish LDC for a variety of models.\nCombined with existing zero-freeness results for these models, we derive new\nSSM results for them. Our work suggests that both Weitz-type FPTASes and SSM\ncan be derived from zero-freeness, while zero-freeness alone suffices for\nWeitz-type FPTASes, SSM additionally requires LDC, a combinatorial property\nindependent of zero-freeness.",

The high-contrast and wide magnification\nrange of NegC-SEM imaging enabled the capture of micro- and nanoscopic\nhierarchical branching structures of CNFs. Two ML approaches [Weka and U-Net]\nwere used to create detailed binary segmentation of grayscale NegC-SEM images,\ncritical for the width analysis. Morphological thinning was applied to the\nbinary image to produce a 1-pixel-wide skeleton of the CNF fibril structure.\nSubsequently, the distance between the skeleton and the original fibril edge\nwas used to calculate fibril width. The FACT framework was optimized and\nvalidated with idealized geometric and hierarchical branched structures. FACT\neffectively performed segmentation, skeletonization, and fibril width\nmeasurement of these CNF morphologies. FACT width results were comparable with\nmanual measurements. In the manual method, a single measurement is made per\nfibril. In contrast, FACT simultaneously makes multiple measurements along each\nfibril within the entire CNF branched network structure.

However, their\ndesign inherently works best for uni-modal image analysis, limiting their\neffectiveness for multi-modal imaging tasks that are common in many medical\nfields, such as neurology and oncology. While supervised models perform well in\nthis setting, they fail to leverage unlabeled datasets and struggle with\nmissing modalities, a frequent challenge in clinical settings. To bridge these\ngaps, we introduce MM-DINOv2, a novel and efficient framework that adapts the\npre-trained vision foundation model DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging. Our\napproach incorporates multi-modal patch embeddings, enabling vision foundation\nmodels to effectively process multi-modal imaging data. To address missing\nmodalities, we employ full-modality masking, which encourages the model to\nlearn robust cross-modality relationships.

Unlike in monolithic blockchains, where a single\nconsensus mechanism determines a strict total order over all transactions,\nMangrove uses separate consensus instances per smart contract, without a global\norder. To allow multiple instances to run in parallel while ensuring that no\nconflicting transactions are committed, we propose a mechanism called Parallel\nOptimistic Agreement. Additionally, for simple transactions, we leverage a\nlightweight Byzantine Reliable Broadcast primitive to reduce latency.

    "abstract": "Blockchains face a scalability limitation, partly due to the throughput\nlimitations of consensus protocols, especially when aiming to obtain a high\ndegree of decentralization. Layer 2 Rollups (L2s) are a faster alternative to\nconventional blockchains. L2s perform most computations offchain using\nminimally blockchains (L1) under-the-hood to guarantee correctness. A sequencer\nis a service that receives offchain L2 transaction requests, batches these\ntransactions, and commits compressed or hashed batches to L1. Using hashing\nneeds less L1 space, which is beneficial for gas cost, but requires a data\navailability committee (DAC) service to translate hashes into their\ncorresponding batches of transaction requests. The behavior of sequencers and\nDACs influence the evolution of the L2 blockchain, presenting a potential\nsecurity threat and delaying L2 adoption. We propose in this paper fraud-proof\nmechanisms, arbitrated by L1 contracts, to detect and generate evidence of\ndishonest behavior of the sequencer and DAC. We study how these fraud-proofs\nlimit the power of adversaries that control different number of sequencer and\nDACs members, and provide incentives for their honest behavior. We designed\nthese fraud-proof mechanisms as two player games. Unlike the generic\nfraud-proofs in current L2s (designed to guarantee the correct execution of\ntransactions), our fraud-proofs are over pred-etermined algorithms that verify\nthe properties that determine the correctness of the DAC. Arbitrating over\nconcrete algorithms makes our fraud-proofs more efficient, easier to\nunderstand, and simpler to prove correct. We provide as an artifact a\nmechanization in LEAN4 of our fraud-proof games, including (1) the verified\nstrategies that honest players should play to win all games as well as (2)\nmechanisms to detect dishonest claims.",

However, existing body models have\nsimplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint\nlocations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their\npotential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating\nbiomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion\ncapture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a\nparametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure\nthat can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL\nbody model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data\nof skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.\n  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons\ninside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL\nmesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we\nre-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting\nSKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and\nbiomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more\nbiomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside\nthe body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes\nwe are able to \"upgrade\" existing human pose and shape datasets to include\nbiomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in\nthe wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better\nconstrained and more realistic model of human articulation.

To overcome these\nevaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework\ndesigned to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated\nsummaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board\ndiscussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results\nshow that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including\npartial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict\nentailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free\nevaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing\nsensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation\nfor delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs.",

    "abstract": "Gamma-Ray Bursts are among the most powerful and violent events in the\nUniverse. Despite over half a century of observations of these transient\nsources, many open questions remain about their nature and the physical\nemission mechanisms at play. Polarization measurements of the GRB prompt\ngamma-ray emission have long been theorized to be able to answer most of these\nquestions. Early polarization measurements did not allow to draw clear\nconclusions because of limited significance.\n  With the aim of better characterizing the polarization of these prompt\nemissions, a compact Gamma-Ray polarimeter called POLAR has been sent to space\nas part of the Tiangong-2 Chinese space lab for 6 months of operations starting\nSeptember 2016. The instrument detected 55 GRBs as well as several pulsars.\nTime-integrated polarization analysis of the 14 brightest detected GRBs has\nshown that the prompt emission is lowly polarized or fully unpolarized.\nHowever, time-resolved analysis depicted strong hints of an evolving\npolarization angle within single pulses, washing out the polarization degree in\ntime-integrated analyses. Energy-resolved polarization analysis has shown no\nconstraining results due to limited statistics. Hence, a more sensitive\n$\\gamma$-ray polarimeter is required to perform detailed energy and\ntime-resolved polarization analysis of the prompt gamma-ray emission of GRBs.\n  Based on the success of the POLAR mission, a larger-scale instrument,\napproved for launch to the China Space Station (CSS) in 2027, is currently\nbeing developed by a Swiss, Chinese, Polish, and German collaboration. Thanks\nto its large sensitivity in the 20-800~keV range, POLAR-2 will produce\npolarization measurements of at least 50 GRBs per year with a precision equal\nto or higher than the best results published by POLAR, allowing for good\nquality time and energy resolved analysis.",

This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in\nstructured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity\nbounds.\n  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between\nmeasurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces\nto structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities\nfor decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a\nmemory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a\nmeasurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law\nof Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical\nbounds based on the Second Law.\n  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty\nPrinciple,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be\nminimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist\ncomplete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic\neffects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance\nto mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a\nmodel-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance\ncomponents are inherently easier to learn.\n  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual\nlearning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower\ntraining cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization\nexperiments.

The last is arguably the most challenging to\nmodel. Traditional SELD approaches typically rely on multichannel input,\nlimiting their capacity to benefit from large-scale pre-training due to data\nconstraints. To overcome this, we enhance a standard SELD architecture with\nsemantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned\nmodels: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs.

The growing prevalence of\ncollaborative robots in industrial environments has increased the need for\nreliable safety systems. However, the lack of high-quality datasets that\ncapture realistic human-robot interactions, including potentially dangerous\nevents, slows development. LiHRA addresses this challenge by providing a\ncomprehensive, multi-modal dataset combining 3D LiDAR point clouds, human body\nkeypoints, and robot joint states, capturing the complete spatial and dynamic\ncontext of human-robot collaboration. This combination of modalities allows for\nprecise tracking of human movement, robot actions, and environmental\nconditions, enabling accurate RM during collaborative tasks.

In total, the data set includes 4,431 labeled point\nclouds recorded at 10 Hz, providing a rich resource for training and\nbenchmarking classical and AI-driven RM algorithms. Finally, to demonstrate\nLiHRA's utility, we introduce an RM method that quantifies the risk level in\neach scenario over time.

Naturally, Cen A has been suspected to create the\nanisotropy - but very different scenarios have been proposed. This includes a\nsubdominant source contribution in combination with isotropic background\nsources, as well as a scenario where Cen A supplies the whole cosmic-ray flux\nabove the ankle. Recently, it was suggested that the overdensity could instead\nconsist of strongly deflected events from the Sombrero galaxy. Thanks to the\nrecent development of several models of the Galactic magnetic field, it is now\npossible to test these proposed scenarios explicitly. Leveraging the measured\noverdensity direction, significance, angular scale, and energy evolution, we\nplace limits on the allowed signal fraction, the possible ejected charge number\nand the strength of the extragalactic magnetic field between the respective\nsource and Earth. We find that the scenario of a subdominant source in the\noverdensity region requires the charge number to be $Z\\lesssim6$ and the\nextragalactic magnetic field quantity $B/\\mathrm{nG} \\sqrt{L_c/\\mathrm{nG}}$ to\nbe between $~1$ and $~100$. For the Sombrero galaxy to be the source, the\ndominant charge number has to be around $Z=6$ with $1\\lesssim B/\\mathrm{nG}\n\\sqrt{L_c/\\mathrm{nG}}\\lesssim20$.

The\nmodel treats each gas as a separate fluid governed by its own set of Euler\nequations, coupled through collisional momentum and energy exchange terms\nderived from a kinetic relaxation model based on the Boltzmann equation. The\nnumerical scheme employs a first-order operator splitting approach combined\nwith a two-step Euler integrator. In this setup, the hydrodynamic evolution is\nfirst computed using standard SPH techniques to handle pressure forces. This is\nfollowed by a separate correction step that accounts for interspecies\ncollisional exchanges. Such a decoupled treatment enables the use of a larger\ntimestep dictated by hydrodynamics rather than the typically much smaller\ncollisional timescale, enhancing computational efficiency. The model achieves\ngood accuracy in reproducing the equilibration of density and temperature in a\nrange of molecular mass ratios. Its modular structure supports natural\nextensions to polyatomic mixtures and enables the inclusion of additional\nphysics, such as gas-solid interactions with dust and ice.

    "abstract": "This paper considers automatic generation control over an information-sharing\nnetwork of communicating generators as a multi-agent system. The optimization\nsolution is distributed among the agents based on information consensus\nalgorithms, while addressing the generators' ramp-rate-limits (RRL). This is\ntypically ignored in the existing linear/nonlinear optimization solutions but\nthey exist in real-time power generation scenarios. Without addressing the RRL,\nthe generators cannot follow the assigned rate of generating power by the\noptimization algorithm; therefore, the existing solutions may not necessarily\nconverge to the exact optimal cost or may lose feasibility in practice. The\nproposed solution in this work addresses the ramp-rate-limit constraint along\nwith the box constraint (limits on the generated powers) and the\ncoupling-constraint (generation-demand balance) at all iteration times of the\nalgorithm. The latter is referred to as the anytime feasibility and implies\nthat at every termination point of the algorithm, the balance between the\ndemand and generated power holds. To improve the convergence rate of the\nalgorithm we further consider internal signum-based nonlinearity. We also show\nthat our solution can tolerate communication link removal. This follows from\nthe uniform-connectivity assumption on the communication network.",

With the sheer\nvolume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife\ntrade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the\nautomatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed\nmachine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife\nproducts within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of\nelephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold\nillegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife\nproducts included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and\ncrafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of\ntraining strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in\nthe automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for\neach species while also developing a single model to identify products from all\nthree species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with\naccuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from\nelephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the\nmachine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as\ngovernment authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a\nsmartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The\napplication can be used in real time to click images and help identify\npotentially prohibited products of target species.

    "abstract": "Hand-drawn character animation is a vibrant field in computer graphics,\npresenting challenges in achieving geometric consistency while conveying\nexpressive motion. Traditional skeletal animation methods maintain geometric\nconsistency but struggle with complex non-rigid elements like flowing hair and\nskirts, leading to unnatural deformation. Conversely, video diffusion models\nsynthesize realistic dynamics but often create geometric distortions in\nstylized drawings due to domain gaps. This work proposes a hybrid animation\nsystem that combines skeletal animation and video diffusion. Initially, coarse\nimages are generated from characters retargeted with skeletal animations for\ngeometric guidance. These images are then enhanced in texture and secondary\ndynamics using video diffusion priors, framing this enhancement as an\ninpainting task. A domain-adapted diffusion model refines user-masked regions\nneeding improvement, especially for secondary dynamics. To enhance motion\nrealism further, we introduce a Secondary Dynamics Injection (SDI) strategy in\nthe denoising process, incorporating features from a pre-trained diffusion\nmodel enriched with human motion priors. Additionally, to tackle unnatural\ndeformations from low-poly single-mesh character modeling, we present a Hair\nLayering Modeling (HLM) technique that uses segmentation maps to separate hair\nfrom the body, allowing for more natural animation of long-haired characters.\nExtensive experiments show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nin both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with external\nsystems through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which standardizes tool\ninvocation and has rapidly become a backbone for LLM-powered applications.\nWhile this paradigm enhances functionality, it also introduces a fundamental\nsecurity shift: LLMs transition from passive information processors to\nautonomous orchestrators of task-oriented toolchains, expanding the attack\nsurface, elevating adversarial goals from manipulating single outputs to\nhijacking entire execution flows. In this paper, we reveal a new class of\nattacks, Parasitic Toolchain Attacks, instantiated as MCP Unintended Privacy\nDisclosure (MCP-UPD). These attacks require no direct victim interaction;\ninstead, adversaries embed malicious instructions into external data sources\nthat LLMs access during legitimate tasks. The malicious logic infiltrates the\ntoolchain and unfolds in three phases: Parasitic Ingestion, Privacy Collection,\nand Privacy Disclosure, culminating in stealthy exfiltration of private data.\nOur root cause analysis reveals that MCP lacks both context-tool isolation and\nleast-privilege enforcement, enabling adversarial instructions to propagate\nunchecked into sensitive tool invocations. To assess the severity, we design\nMCP-SEC and conduct the first large-scale security census of the MCP ecosystem,\nanalyzing 12,230 tools across 1,360 servers. Our findings show that the MCP\necosystem is rife with exploitable gadgets and diverse attack methods,\nunderscoring systemic risks in MCP platforms and the urgent need for defense\nmechanisms in LLM-integrated environments.",

    "abstract": "Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static\nscenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones\nwithin fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should\nincrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data\nstreams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the\ndiscriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to\nrestricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class\nconfusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation\nlearning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown\nrepresentations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an\nangular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating\nexcessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt\na virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known\nrepresentations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through\nboundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification\nstrategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation\nbias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and\npositive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100\nand TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental\nresults across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.",

These are mainly reflected in the limited\ncapacity of the constant false-alarm rate model to accurately represent\ninformation, the insufficient depiction of complex scenes, and the limited\ninformation acquired by the tracker. We introduce the Integrated Detection and\nTracking based on radar feature (InDT) method, which comprises a network\narchitecture for radar signal detection and a tracker that leverages detection\nassistance. The InDT detector extracts feature information from each\nRange-Doppler (RD) matrix and then returns the target position through the\nfeature enhancement module and the detection head. The InDT tracker adaptively\nupdates the measurement noise covariance of the Kalman filter based on\ndetection confidence. The similarity of target RD features is measured by\ncosine distance, which enhances the data association process by combining\nlocation and feature information.

The PPT condition is\nexpressed in terms of the inequality between the second-order moment of the\nsystem's partial transposition $(p_2)$ and the reciprocal of the product of\n$d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$. The second order moment $(p_{2})$ plays a vital role in\ndetecting the PPT states as it is very easy to calculate and may be a\nrealizable quantity in an experiment. Once we know that the given state is a\nPPT state, we will use a suitable witness operator to detect whether the given\nPPT state is a PPTES. Further, we have established a relation between the\nsecond and third order moments of partial transposition of a PPT state and have\nshown that the violation of the inequality implies that the detected state is a\nnegative partial transpose (NPT) entangled state. We will then construct a\nquantum state by considering the mixture of a separable and an entangled state\nand obtain a condition on the mixing parameter for which the mixture represents\na PPT entangled state. We observe that the resulting PPT entangled state may\nalso be detected by the same witness operator $W$, which had detected the\nentangled state present in the mixture. Finally, applying our results, we have\nshown that the distillable key rate of the private state, prepared through our\nprescription, is positive.

Ionic evolution offers tempting opportunities for accessing exotic\nmagnetoelectric states and physical functionality beyond conventional doping\nparadigm via tailoring the charge-lattice-orbital-spin interactions. Here, we\nshowcase the precise magneto-ionic control over magnetoelectric states in LSMO\nsystem, delicately delivering silicon-compatible weakly ferromagnetic insulator\nstate above room temperature.

Our work not only defines a novel design paradigm for exploring\nexotic quantum states in correlated system, with transformative potential for\nspintronics, but also fundamentally unveils the physical origin behind ionic\nevolution via disentangling the ion-charge-spin coupling.",

In particular, we can activate nonadiabatic passages superposed of\ninitial and target modes by the commutation condition for the Hamiltonian's\ncoefficient matrix in the representation of time-independent ancillary modes,\nwhich serves as the necessary and sufficient condition to solve the\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation of the entire network.

Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on\nbenign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive\nrates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques\nhave demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by\nlearning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In\nparticular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the\ndistance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it\nbetween dissimilar (negative) views.

In\ncontrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative\npairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented\nsamples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious\ndistributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This\napproach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after\npretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset\ndemonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and\nanomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task.

The optimal classical algorithm enumerates keys in decreasing order\nof likelihood. The optimal quantum algorithm, due to Montanaro (2011), is a\nsophisticated Grover search.\n  We give the first tight analysis for Montanaro's algorithm, showing that its\nruntime is $2^{H_{2/3}(D)/2}$, where $H_{\\alpha}(\\cdot)$ denotes Renyi entropy\nwith parameter $\\alpha$. Interestingly, this is a direct consequence of an\ninformation theoretic result called Arikan's Inequality (1996) -- which has so\nfar been missed in the cryptographic community -- that tightly bounds the\nruntime of classical key guessing by $2^{H_{1/2}(D)}$. Since $H_{2/3}(D) <\nH_{1/2}(D)$ for every non-uniform distribution $D$, we thus obtain a\nsuper-quadratic quantum speed-up $s>2$ over classical key guessing.\n  As another main result, we provide the first thorough analysis of guessing in\na multi-key setting. Specifically, we consider the task of attacking many keys\nsampled independently from some distribution $D$, and aim to guess a fraction\nof them. For product distributions $D = \\chi^n$, we show that any constant\nfraction of keys can be guessed within $2^{H(D)}$ classically and $2 ^{H(D)/2}$\nquantumly per key, where $H(\\chi)$ denotes Shannon entropy. In contrast,\nArikan's Inequality implies that guessing a single key costs $2^{H_{1/2}(D)}$\nclassically and $2^{H_{2/3}(D)/2}$ quantumly. Since $H(D) < H_{2/3}(D) <\nH_{1/2}(D)$, this shows that in a multi-key setting the guessing cost per key\nis substantially smaller than in a single-key setting, both classically and\nquantumly.",

    "abstract": "Malware classification is a contemporary and ongoing challenge in\ncyber-security: modern obfuscation techniques are able to evade traditional\nstatic analysis, while dynamic analysis is too resource intensive to be\ndeployed at a large scale. One prominent line of research addresses these\nlimitations by converting malware binaries into 2D images by heuristically\nreshaping them into a 2D grid before resizing using Lanczos resampling. These\nimages can then be classified based on their textural information using\ncomputer vision approaches. While this approach can detect obfuscated malware\nmore effectively than static analysis, the process of converting files into 2D\nimages results in significant information loss due to both quantisation noise,\ncaused by rounding to integer pixel values, and the introduction of 2D\ndependencies which do not exist in the original data. This loss of signal\nlimits the classification performance of the downstream model. This work\naddresses these weaknesses by instead resizing the files into 1D signals which\navoids the need for heuristic reshaping, and additionally these signals do not\nsuffer from quantisation noise due to being stored in a floating-point format.\nIt is shown that existing 2D CNN architectures can be readily adapted to\nclassify these 1D signals for improved performance. Furthermore, a bespoke 1D\nconvolutional neural network, based on the ResNet architecture and\nsqueeze-and-excitation layers, was developed to classify these signals and\nevaluated on the MalNet dataset. It was found to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on binary, type, and family level classification with F1 scores of\n0.874, 0.503, and 0.507, respectively, paving the way for future models to\noperate on the proposed signal modality.",

This interplay between the two semiconductors\nis confirmed by 1meresolved photoluminescence spectroscopy highligh1ng a clear\nreduc1on of the QW exciton life1me in the presence of the monolayer.\nInteres1ngly the coupling between the QW and the TMD monolayer is also\ndemonstrated by measuring op1cally the excitonic transport proper1es in the\nquantum well: the exciton diffusion length decreases in the presence of the\nMoSe2 monolayer. The measured dependences as a func1on of temperature highlight\nthe role played by localiza1on effects in the QW. All these results can be well\ninterpreted by a type II band alignment between the InGaN QW and the MoSe2\nmonolayer and a tunneling process between the two semiconductors.",

In these models, transport is modeled at the\nmacroscale through an operator, the so-called graph Laplacian, based on the\nedge properties and topology, capturing the fluxes between different nodes of\nthe network. However, this phenomenological approach fails to take into account\nthe physical processes taking place at the microscale within the edge. A\nfundamental problem is then to obtain a transport operator from mechanistic\nprinciples based on the underlying transport process. Using\nadvection-reaction-diffusion as a generic mechanism for inter-nodal exchanges,\nwe derive a multiscale network transport model and obtain the corresponding\nlinear transport operator at the macroscale from first principles.

As AI-driven search evolves,\nlong-form queries with intricate intents are becoming more prevalent, yet they\nremain underexplored in the context of LLM-based query understanding (QU). To\nbridge this gap, we introduce ReDI: a Reasoning-enhanced approach for query\nunderstanding through Decomposition and Interpretation.

We compiled a\nlarge-scale dataset of real-world complex queries from a major search engine\nand distilled the query understanding capabilities of teacher models into\nsmaller models for practical application.

    "abstract": "The optical properties of atomically thin semiconductors are dominated by\nexcitons, tightly bound electron-hole pairs, which give rise to particularly\nrich and remarkable physics. Despite their importance, the microscopic\nformation mechanisms of excitons remain very poorly understood due to the\ncomplex interplay of concurrent phenomena occurring on an ultrafast timescale.\nHere, we investigate the exciton formation processes in 2D materials based on\ntransition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers using a technique based on the\ncontrol of excitation light polarization. It allows us to distinguish between\nthe two competing models of exciton formation: geminate and bimolecular\nformation. The geminate process is the direct formation of the exciton from the\ninitially photogenerated electron hole pair before the loss of correlation\nbetween them, whereas the bimolecular process corresponds to the random binding\nof free electron hole-pairs from the initially photogenerated plasma. These\nprocesses control the exciton formation time. Our findings reveal that the\nluminescence intensity is higher by up to 40% for circularly polarized\nexcitation compared to linearly polarized excitation for laser energy above the\nfree carrier gap. We show that this spin-dependent exciton emission is a\nfingerprint of the bimolecular formation process. Importantly, we observe that\nexciton linear polarization (valley coherence) persists even for laser\nexcitation energies exceeding the gap. We demonstrate that it is the result of\na fraction of excitons formed by a geminate process. This shows that two\nformation processes coexist for excitation energies above the gap, where both\nmechanisms operate concurrently.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To develop and interpret a supervised variational autoencoder\n(VAE) model for classifying cardiotocography (CTG) signals based on pregnancy\noutcomes, addressing interpretability limits of current deep learning\napproaches. Methods: The OxMat CTG dataset was used to train a VAE on\nfive-minute fetal heart rate (FHR) segments, labeled with postnatal outcomes.\nThe model was optimised for signal reconstruction and outcome prediction,\nincorporating Kullback-Leibler divergence and total correlation (TC)\nconstraints to structure the latent space. Performance was evaluated using area\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and mean squared\nerror (MSE). Interpretability was assessed using coefficient of determination,\nlatent traversals and unsupervised component analyses. Results: The model\nachieved an AUROC of 0.752 at the segment level and 0.779 at the CTG level,\nwhere predicted scores were aggregated. Relaxing TC constraints improved both\nreconstruction and classification. Latent analysis showed that baseline-related\nfeatures (e.g., FHR baseline, baseline shift) were well represented and aligned\nwith model scores, while metrics like short- and long-term variability were\nless strongly encoded. Traversals revealed clear signal changes for baseline\nfeatures, while other properties were entangled or subtle. Unsupervised\ndecompositions corroborated these patterns. Findings: This work demonstrates\nthat supervised VAEs can achieve competitive fetal outcome prediction while\npartially encoding clinically meaningful CTG features. The irregular,\nmulti-timescale nature of FHR signals poses challenges for disentangling\nphysiological components, distinguishing CTG from more periodic signals such as\nECG.

We define the problem of\nsensitivity-based parametric uncertainty quantification in dynamical system\nestimation. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel\nrobustness metric for estimation of parametrized linear dynamical systems with\nand without control actions. For the computation of this metric, we delineate\nthe uncertainty contributions arising from control actions, system dynamics,\nand initial conditions. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical findings, we\nestablish connections between these new results and the existing literature on\nthe robustness of model reduction. This work provides guidance for selecting\nestimation methods based on tolerable levels of parametric uncertainty and\npaves the way for new cost functions in data-driven estimation that reward\nsensitivity to a desired subset of parameters while penalizing others.",

We have\nreliably determined periods for 9 targets. In terms of spin rate, we have\nconfirmed four SFRs with periods of 1.06-1.84 hr and peak-to-peak amplitudes of\n0.054-0.685 mag.

    "abstract": "We investigate the mechanism of chain exchange in diblock copolymer micelles\nusing two distinct yet complementary simulation techniques. First, enhanced\nsampling method is combined with coarse-grained molecular dynamics to compute a\ntwo-dimensional free energy surface for the chain expulsion process in the\nstrong segregation regime. To facilitate chain expulsion, a distance-based\ncollective variable is biased, and the end-to-end distance of the core block is\nalso biased to ensure sufficient sampling of chain conformations. The free\nenergy surface reveals a bimodal distribution of chain conformations along the\neffective reaction coordinate. The minimum free energy pathway qualitatively\naligns with the Halperin-Alexander budding-like mechanism. The free energy\nbarrier along this pathway is calculated for core block lengths ranging from\n$N_\\textrm{core}=4$-$100$, and the barrier is shown to scale as $\\beta\\Delta\nF_\\textrm{barr} \\sim N_\\textrm{core}^{2/3}$, consistent with the\nHalperin-Alexander prediction for a globular transition state. Notably, the\nfree energy surface also reveals a nearly degenerate alternative pathway in\nwhich the chain escapes by extending out bead-by-bead, in agreement with\nprevious simulations. We also study the case of a dense copolymer melt, where\nthe core-block shrinks but does not collapse into a dry compact globule in the\nopposite phase. To examine the kinetic pathway, a simplified model is\nintroduced in which a single chain escapes from a planar interface within a\nmean-field background. Forward flux sampling calculations yield a linear\nscaling of the barrier, $\\beta\\Delta F_\\textrm{barr} \\sim N_\\textrm{core}$, in\nagreement with experimental observations and prior simulations. Moreover,\nanalysis of successful escape trajectories highlights an extended chain\nconformation at the transition state.",

The\ngiant impact theory can explain most of the properties of the Earth-Moon\nsystem, however, simulations with respect to giant impact between a planetary\nembryo and the growing proto-Earth show that more than 40 percent of the\nmaterials in the circum-terrestrial debris disk produced by the giant impact\noriginates from the impactor. Thus, the giant impact theory has difficulty\nexplaining the Moon's Earth-like isotopic compositions, which is referred to as\nthe lunar isotopic crisis. With the assumption that Theia may have possessed an\niron-rich mantle compared with proto-Earth's mantle, here we show that, after\nthe formation of the stratified lunar magma ocean, solidification of the\nstratified lunar magma ocean would result that the upper solid layer is\ncomposed of proto-Earth's mantle and the lower solid layer is made of Theia's\nmantle, meaning that the Moon's Earth-like isotopic composition is a natural\nresult of the giant impact. The theory proposed here may provide a way of\nexplaining the lunar isotopic crisis.",

Its complex and multifactorial origins limit the effectiveness of\ncurrent clinical predictors and impede optimal care. In this study, a\ndual-branch deep learning architecture (PUUMA) was developed to predict\ngestational age (GA) at birth using T2* fetal MRI data from 295 pregnancies,\nencompassing a heterogeneous and imbalanced population. The model integrates\nboth global whole-uterus and local placental features. Its performance was\nbenchmarked against linear regression using cervical length measurements\nobtained by experienced clinicians from anatomical MRI and other Deep Learning\narchitectures. The GA at birth predictions were assessed using mean absolute\nerror. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to assess preterm\nclassification. Both the fully automated MRI-based pipeline and the cervical\nlength regression achieved comparable mean absolute errors (3 weeks) and good\nsensitivity (0.67) for detecting preterm birth, despite pronounced class\nimbalance in the dataset. These results provide a proof of concept for\nautomated prediction of GA at birth from functional MRI, and underscore the\nvalue of whole-uterus functional imaging in identifying at-risk pregnancies.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that manual, high-definition cervical length\nmeasurements derived from MRI, not currently routine in clinical practice,\noffer valuable predictive information.

However, the high incidence\nof poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms\nor diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited\ngeneralizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task\ntransferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel\nmultimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to\nacquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is\npre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second\nwaveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track\narchitecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality,\nleveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality\nsignals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To\nefficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local\nquasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism\nwithin our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function,\nwhich combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect\nreconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation\nof frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models\nwith varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy\nand practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks:\nfalse alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial\nfibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and\nECG signals.",

All these applications benefit from faster\ntransformations, as a high cycle frequency is essential for achieving high\npower density. However, systematic investigations of the fast dynamics and\nfundamental speed limits of martensitic transformations are scarce. Especially\nfor ultrashort time transformations, the temperature evolution throughout the\ntransformation is not measured, which is a substantial shortcoming as\ntemperature is the intrinsic force driving the transformation. Here, we present\na synchrotron-based time-resolved X-ray diffraction study of a 270 fs\nlaser-induced martensitic transformation in a Ni-Mn-Ga-based epitaxial thin\nfilm. We observe the transformation from martensite to austenite within about\n100 ps, just limited by the synchrotron probe pulse duration. Furthermore, a\nfull transformation cycle from martensite to austenite and back to martensite\ncan almost be finished within 5 ns, which is the fastest martensitic\ntransformation reported so far. Measurements and calculations of the\ntemperature evolution allow us to analyse the influence of temperature on\ntransformation time. By time-resolved strain measurements we demonstrate that\nin addition to temperature, thermal film stress must be considered as a\ncompeting influence on the martensitic transformation. Our experimental\nfindings are supported by molecular dynamics simulations with machine learned\nforce fields adapted to density functional theory calculations. These reveal\nthat the huge distortion during a martensitic transformation requires the\ncollective movement of many atoms within the microstructure, which delays the\ntransformation.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative perception enables more accurate and comprehensive scene\nunderstanding by learning how to share information between agents, with LiDAR\npoint clouds providing essential precise spatial data. Due to the substantial\ndata volume generated by LiDAR sensors, efficient point cloud transmission is\nessential for low-latency multi-agent collaboration. In this work, we propose\nan efficient, robust and applicable LiDAR point cloud transmission system via\nthe Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), termed LiDAR Point Cloud Feature\nTransmission (LPC-FT), to support collaborative perception among multiple\nagents. Specifically, we employ a density-preserving deep point cloud\ncompression method that encodes the complete point cloud into a downsampled\nefficient representation. To mitigate the effects of the wireless channel, we\ndesign a channel encoder module based on self-attention to enhance LiDAR point\ncloud features and a feature fusion module based on cross-attention to\nintegrate features from transceivers. Furthermore, we utilize the nonlinear\nactivation layer and transfer learning to improve the training of deep neural\nnetworks in the presence the digital channel noise. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed LPC-FT is more robust and effective than\ntraditional octree-based compression followed by channel coding, and\noutperforms state-of-the-art deep learning-based compression techniques and\nexisting semantic communication methods, reducing the Chamfer Distance by 30%\nand improving the PSNR by 1.9 dB on average. Owing to its superior\nreconstruction performance and robustness against channel variations, LPC-FT is\nexpected to support collaborative perception tasks.",

    "abstract": "The generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to approximate an unknown\ndistribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been\nwidely applied in reinforcement and semisupervised learning as well as computer\nvision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search and\nonly a few selection methods can be proved to be theoretically optimal. One of\nthe most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on\noptimal parameters for WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)\nsetting, where the NN is linear and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we\nfocus on the characterization of optimal WGAN parameters beyond the LQG\nsetting. We derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGANs\nwhen the NN has non-linear activation functions and the data is non-Gaussian.\nTo extend this to high-dimensional WGANs, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein\nframework and replace the constraint on marginal distributions of the randomly\nprojected data by a constraint on the joint distribution of the original\n(unprojected) data. We show that the linear generator can be asymptotically\noptimal for sliced WGAN with non-Gaussian data. Empirical studies show that our\nclosed-form WGAN parameters have good convergence behavior with data under both\nGaussian and Laplace distributions. Also, compared to the r principal component\nanalysis (r-PCA) solution, our proposed solution for sliced WGAN can achieve\nthe same performance while requiring less computational resources.",

By modelling the plant as a disc with a signal source at the\ncenter and radial growth, we show that we can reproduce both Fibonacci spirals\nand alternating patterns, depending on a balance between growth and source.\nFinally, using linear stability analysis, we show how the pattern arises due to\na balance between the growth of instabilities and the growth of the plant.\nOverall, this work demonstrates how the Keller-Segel model can reproduce a wide\nrange of observed patterns, and may act as a phenomenological description of a\nnumber of processes in plants.",

Recent work has\nfound that this process may leave an imprint in the H$_2$O spectrum in the form\nof excess flux in the cold H$_2$O lines. In this work, we aim to test the\naccuracy of several common retrieval techniques on full 2D thermochemical disk\nmodels. Moreover, we investigate the cold H$_2$O emission that has been\nproposed as a signature of drift, to gain further insights into the underlying\nradial and vertical distribution of H$_2$O. We present two sets of Dust And\nLInes (DALI) thermochemical models and run several retrieval techniques to\ninvestigate how the retrieved temperature and column density compare to our\nmodels. Single-temperature slab retrievals mainly trace the warm ($\\sim$500 K)\nH$_2$O reservoir, whereas a three-component fit is able to better trace the\nfull temperature gradient in the IR emitting region. Retrieved temperatures\ntend to underestimate the true temperature of the emitting layer due to non-LTE\neffects. The retrieved column density traces close to the mid-IR dust $\\tau=1$\nsurface. We find that the strength of the cold H$_2$O emission is directly\nlinked to the H$_2$O abundance above the snow surface at large radii (>1 au).\nThis implies that sources with excess cold H$_2$O flux likely have a high\nH$_2$O abundance in this region ($\\gtrsim10^{-5}$), higher than predicted by\nthe chemical network. This discrepancy is most likely caused by the absence of\ndust transport processes in our models, further strengthening the theory that\nthis emission may be a signature of radial drift and vertical mixing.",

    "abstract": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem\nproving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by\nchallenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and\ninference-time compute. This paper introduces \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system\ndesigned to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary\ninnovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for\ncontinually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This\nframework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage\nexpert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and\nperiodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail\nlong-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced\nmulti-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference\ntime. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level\nplanner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler\nsubgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,\nenabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by\nleveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to\nscaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics\nbenchmarks. \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\\% and 41.4\\% on the MiniF2F\nand ProofNet test sets respectively.

The properties of these outflows change dramatically\nbetween different spectral/accretion states. Collimated, compact jets are\nobserved during the hard state and are quenched during the soft state, while\ndiscrete ejecta are mainly launched during the hard-to-soft state transition.\nCurrently, we still do not understand what triggers the formation and\ndestruction of compact jets or the launch of discrete ejecta. In this context,\nfinding a unique link between the jet evolution and the properties of the X-ray\nemission, such as its fast variability, would imply a major progress in our\nunderstanding of the fundamental mechanisms that drive relativistic outflows in\nBH XRBs. Here we show that a brief but strong radio re-brightening during a\npredominantly soft state of the BH XRB MAXI J1348$-$630 was contemporaneous\nwith a significant increase in the X-ray rms variability observed with NICER in\n2019. During this phase, the variability displayed significant changes and, at\nthe same time, MAXI J1348$-$630 launched two pairs of relativistic discrete\nejecta that we detected with the MeerKAT and ATCA radio-interferometers. We\npropose that short-lived compact jets were reactivated during this excursion to\nthe hard-intermediate state and were switched off before the ejecta launch, a\nphenomenology that has been very rarely observed in these systems.\nInterestingly, with the caveat of gaps in our radio and X-ray coverage, we\nsuggest a tentative correspondence between the launch of ejecta and the drop in\nX-ray rms variability in this source, while other typical X-ray signatures\nassociated with discrete ejections are not detected.

The symmetric interior penalty discontinuous\nGalerkin method is employed for spatial discretization and the backward Euler\nmethod for temporal discretization. Unlike other splitting algorithms, this\ntype of sequential method does not require any internal iterations and the\ncomputational efficiency is higher than that of the fully implicit nonlinear\nnumerical scheme. In the theoretical analysis, a cut-off operator is introduced\nto prove the existence and uniqueness of numerical solution and the stability\nanalysis of numerical scheme is conducted.

An alternative scenario was proposed\nthat implies a second resonance of the Higgs field ${\\cal H}$ with a well\ndelimited mass $(M_H)^{\\rm Theor} = 690\\,(30)$ GeV. This stabilises the\npotential, but, owing to an $H$ coupling to longitudinal $W$s with the same\ntypical strength as that of the low-mass state with $m_h= 125$ GeV, it would\nstill remain a relatively narrow resonance. Our scope here is twofold. First,\nleaving out many details, we outline a simple logical path where the,\napparently surprising, idea of such a second resonance follows from basic\nproperties of $\\Phi^4$ theories. Secondly, we spell out a definite experimental\nsignature of this resonance that is clearly visible in various LHC data.

However, a framework for systematically benchmarking these hybrid\nagents is still underexplored. To take the first step in bridging this gap, we\nintroduce MAS-Bench, a benchmark that pioneers the evaluation of GUI-shortcut\nhybrid agents with a specific focus on the mobile domain. Beyond merely using\npredefined shortcuts, MAS-Bench assesses an agent's capability to autonomously\ngenerate shortcuts by discovering and creating reusable, low-cost workflows. It\nfeatures 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world applications, a knowledge base\nof 88 predefined shortcuts (APIs, deep-links, RPA scripts), and 7 evaluation\nmetrics. The tasks are designed to be solvable via GUI-only operations, but can\nbe significantly accelerated by intelligently embedding shortcuts. Experiments\nshow that hybrid agents achieve significantly higher success rates and\nefficiency than their GUI-only counterparts. This result also demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our method for evaluating an agent's shortcut generation\ncapabilities. MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap, providing a\nfoundational platform for future advancements in creating more efficient and\nrobust intelligent agents.",

Using long slit spectroscopy at multiple position angles from the\nHubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and the Apache\nPoint Observatory Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi Object Spectrograph, we separate\nthese kinematic components by fitting multiple Gaussians to the H{\\alpha}, N\nII, H{\\beta}, and O III emission lines along the slits.

Our view into the bicone edge is\nconsistent with the multiple, deep components of ionized absorption lines seen\nin UV and X-ray spectra of NGC 3516. The observed turnover in the velocity of\nthe NLR clouds matches that from a simple dynamical model of radiative\nacceleration by the AGN and gravitational deceleration by the AGN and galaxy,\nindicating they are the principal forces at work on the gas clouds.

Methods: The\nframework builds upon the Gadgetron platform and includes: (1) an input\nconverter to transform ISMRMRD format raw into a Siemens format raw structure,\nfacilitating reuse of existing code; (2) an asynchronous trigger-and-retrieve\nmechanism enabling long reconstructions without delaying scanner processes; (3)\nresource-aware scheduling for parallel execution; (4) integrated file\nmanagement to support multi-scan inputs; and (5) preservation of scanner-based\nreconstructions and post-processing. The framework was validated on 2 Siemens\nscanners for SENSE, AlignedSENSE, and NUFFT reconstructions, and in a\nlarge-cohort study. Results: Minimum code modification for inline deployment\nhas been shown, and all reconstructions were successfully executed inline\nwithout disrupting scanner workflows. Images were retrieved via automated or\nretro-reconstruction, with scanner-based post-processing applied to custom\noutputs. Multi-scan input reconstructions were executed using GPU-aware\nscheduling, confirming feasibility for routine and large-scale applications. In\n480 consecutive examinations, inline reconstructions were retrieved in 99% of\ncases without disruptions. Conclusion: The framework lowers the technical\nbarrier to inline deployment of offline reconstructions, enabling robust,\nscalable, and post-processing-compatible integration. It is openly available\nwith documentation and demonstration cases to support reproducibility and\ncommunity adoption.",

To tackle this, we propose a novel post-retrieval\nknowledge filtering approach.

Using this model, we build a preference dataset\n(NQ_Rerank) to fine-tune a reranker, enabling it to prioritize contexts\npreferred by the downstream LLM during reranking. Additionally, we introduce\nConfidence-Based Dynamic Retrieval (CBDR), which adaptively triggers retrieval\nbased on the LLM`s initial confidence in the original question, reducing\nknowledge conflicts and improving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in accuracy for context screening and end-to-end RAG\nperformance, along with a notable reduction in retrieval costs while\nmaintaining competitive accuracy.",

The bubbles are manifested\nby extraplanar soft X-ray emission with an X-shaped morphology, which is\ntightly co-spatial with $\\rm H\\alpha$ line emission and partially coincident\nwith radio continuum. Low surface brightness diffuse X-ray emission can be\ntraced out to ~ 90 kpc from the galactic center, revealing the presence of an\nextended hot gaseous halo. X-ray spectral analysis of the bubbles yields a gas\ntemperature of $0.70^{+0.16}_{-0.18}$ keV, a relatively high value among known\ngalactic-scale bubbles in the local universe. An average energy injection rate\nof ~ $10^{43}$ erg $\\rm s^{-1}$ is required to inflate the bubbles within an\nestimated dynamical age of ~ 6.4 Myr. The multi-wavelength properties of the\nbubbles can be understood with the conventional superwind scenario, in which\ndisk/halo gas is swept up into an expanding, cooling shell by a hot tenuous\nwind. The current starburst in NGC 6286 is energetically sufficient to launch\nthe superwind, although we cannot rule out the possibility of a more violent\nAGN in the recent past as the driving source.

    "abstract": "The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse\nnatural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how\nthe frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized\ndomains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report\ninvestigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision\ntransformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,\ncan directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks\nwithout domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3\nacross common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and\nsegmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically\nanalyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our\nfindings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a\nformidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific\nfoundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being\ntrained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The\nmodel's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,\nsuch as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),\nand Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3\ndoes not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does\nnot reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing\ndiverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3\nas a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust\nprior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future\ndirections, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in\n3D reconstruction.",

Existing sequence or structure\nmethods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific\nbinding sites on the antigens. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{CAME-AB}, a\nnovel Cross-modality Attention framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nbackbone for robust antibody binding site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five\nbiologically grounded modalities, including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM\nsubstitution profiles, pretrained language model embeddings, structure-aware\nfeatures, and GCN-refined biochemical graphs, into a unified multimodal\nrepresentation. To enhance adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an\n\\emph{adaptive modality fusion} module that learns to dynamically weight each\nmodality based on its global relevance and input-specific contribution. A\nTransformer encoder combined with an MoE module further promotes feature\nspecialization and capacity expansion. We additionally incorporate a supervised\ncontrastive learning objective to explicitly shape the latent space geometry,\nencouraging intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. To improve\noptimization stability and generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging\nduring training. Extensive experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets\ndemonstrate that CAME-AB consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple\nmetrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation\nstudies further validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and\nthe benefit of multimodal feature integration.

    "abstract": "In our age of digital platforms, human attention has become a scarce and\nhighly valuable resource, rivalrous, tradable, and increasingly subject to\nmarket dynamics. This article explores the commodification of attention within\nthe framework of the attention economy, arguing that attention should be\nunderstood as a common good threatened by over-exploitation. Drawing from\nphilosophical, economic, and legal perspectives, we first conceptualize\nattention not only as an individual cognitive process but as a collective and\ninfrastructural phenomenon susceptible to enclosure by digital intermediaries.\nWe then identify and analyze negative externalities of the attention economy,\nparticularly those stemming from excessive screen time: diminished individual\nagency, adverse health outcomes, and societal and political harms, including\ndemocratic erosion and inequality. These harms are largely unpriced by market\nactors and constitute a significant market failure. In response, among a\nspectrum of public policy tools ranging from informational campaigns to\noutright restrictions, we propose a Pigouvian tax on attention capture as a\npromising regulatory instrument to internalize the externalities and, in\nparticular, the social cost of compulsive digital engagement. Such a tax would\nincentivize structural changes in platform design while preserving user\nautonomy. By reclaiming attention as a shared resource vital to human agency,\nhealth, and democracy, this article contributes a novel economic and policy\nlens to the debate on digital regulation. Ultimately, this article advocates\nfor a paradigm shift: from treating attention as a private, monetizable asset\nto protecting it as a collective resource vital for humanity.",

    "abstract": "Spotify has recently introduced audiobooks as part of its catalog,\ncomplementing its music and podcast offering. Search is often the first entry\npoint for users to access new items, and an important goal for Spotify is to\nsupport users in the exploration of the audiobook catalog. More specifically,\nwe would like to enable users without a specific item in mind to broadly search\nby topic, genre, story tropes, decade, and discover audiobooks, authors and\npublishers they may like. To do this, we need to 1) inspire users to type more\nexploratory queries for audiobooks and 2) augment our retrieval systems to\nbetter deal with exploratory audiobook queries. This is challenging in a\ncold-start scenario, where we have a retrievabiliy bias due to the little\namount of user interactions with audiobooks compared to previously available\nitems such as music and podcast content. To address this, we propose\nAudioBoost, a system to boost audiobook retrievability in Spotify's Search via\nsynthetic query generation. AudioBoost leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto generate synthetic queries conditioned on audiobook metadata. The synthetic\nqueries are indexed both in the Query AutoComplete (QAC) and in the Search\nRetrieval engine to improve query formulation and retrieval at the same time.\nWe show through offline evaluation that synthetic queries increase\nretrievability and are of high quality. Moreover, results from an online A/B\ntest show that AudioBoost leads to a +0.7% in audiobook impressions, +1.22% in\naudiobook clicks, and +1.82% in audiobook exploratory query completions.",

In this study, we use the example of the Atlantic\nMeridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) to demonstrate the challenges\nassociated with anticipating such transitions when the system is susceptible to\nbifurcation-induced, rate-induced, and noise-induced tipping. Using a\ncalibrated AMOC box model, we conduct large ensemble simulations and show that\ntransition behavior is inherently probabilistic: under identical freshwater\nforcing scenarios, some ensemble members exhibit transitions while others do\nnot. In this stochastic regime, traditional early warning indicators based on\ncritical slowing down are unreliable in predicting impending transitions. To\naddress this limitation, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\napproach that identifies higher-order statistical differences between\ntransitioning and non-transitioning trajectories within the ensemble\nrealizations. This method enables the real-time prediction of transition\nprobabilities for individual trajectories prior to the onset of tipping. Our\nresults show that the CNN-based indicator provides effective early warnings in\na system where transitions can be induced by bifurcations, critical forcing\nrates, and noise. These findings underscore the potential in identifying safe\noperating spaces and early warning indicators for abrupt transitions of Earth\nsystem components under uncertainty.",

The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into\nstandardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs\nintegrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate\nlightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three\nanonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,\nde-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize\nresponse latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier\ncaching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache,\nand cloud inference cache.

    "abstract": "In high-energy astrophysics, interpreting observed spectra hinges on\nunderstanding the competition between energy gains and radiative losses. To\nprogress along these lines, we report on particle-in-cell simulations of\nparticle acceleration in relativistic, magnetized turbulent pair plasmas\nincluding synchrotron radiative losses. Our key finding is that the particle\nenergy spectrum does not terminate at this maximal energy but extends beyond\nwith a steepened spectrum, up to the synchrotron burn-off limit where particles\ncool within a gyrotime. For our adopted parameters (magnetization $\\sigma\n\\approx 1 $ and amplitude $\\delta B/B_0\\simeq 1$), the particle distribution\nfollows ${\\rm d}n/{\\rm d}\\gamma\\propto \\gamma^{-s}$ with $s\\simeq 3$ below the\npredicted maximal energy, then steepens to $s\\simeq 4$ above. The particle\ndistribution and the radiated synchrotron spectra display strong variability\nnear the cutoff energy down to timescales well below the largest eddy\nturn-around time. We substantiate our results by demonstrating that the\nacceleration rate itself displays a broken powerlaw-like distribution whose\nmaximal value is the gyrofrequency. The highest energy particles are\naccelerated by a generalized Fermi process in ideal electric fields, driven by\na gradient of the $4$--velocity field $u_E$ of the magnetic field lines of\nrelativistic amplitude, $\\delta u_E \\gtrsim c$, ordered on a scale comparable\nto the particle gyroradius. We contend that this is a generic feature of\nrelativistic, large-amplitude turbulence. Lastly, we apply our results to the\nCrab nebula, which exhibits a hierarchy of characteristic Lorentz factors\nsimilar to that studied here. We conclude that stochastic acceleration in this\nenvironment is a promising mechanism for explaining the highest-energy part of\nthe synchrotron spectral energy distribution, and its variability.

Given two linear matroids over the same ground set, the linear\nmatroid intersection problem asks you to find a common independent set of\nmaximum size. The deep interest in linear matroid intersection is due to the\nfact that it generalises many classical problems in theoretical computer\nscience, such as bipartite matching, edge disjoint spanning trees, rainbow\nspanning tree, and many more.\n  We study this problem in the model of catalytic computation: space-bounded\nmachines are granted access to \\textit{catalytic space}, which is additional\nworking memory that is full with arbitrary data that must be preserved at the\nend of its computation.\n  Although linear matroid intersection has had a polynomial time algorithm for\nover 50 years, it remains an important open problem to show that linear matroid\nintersection belongs to any well studied subclass of $\\mathsf{P}$. We address\nthis problem for the class catalytic logspace ($\\mathsf{CL}$) with a polynomial\ntime bound ($\\mathsf{CLP}$).\n  Recently, Agarwala and Mertz (2025) showed that bipartite maximum matching\ncan be computed in the class $\\mathsf{CLP}\\subseteq \\mathsf{P}$. This was the\nfirst subclass of $\\mathsf{P}$ shown to contain bipartite matching, and\nadditionally the first problem outside $\\mathsf{TC}^1$ shown to be contained in\n$\\mathsf{CL}$.

    "abstract": "Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic\nenvironments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods\nstruggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)\nMLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language\nmodels merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the\nseparability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal\nand spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information\ndensity. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground\nvisual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and\nfine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance\nthe separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled\nforeground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and\nbackground cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token\ncan effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,\nenabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.\nExperiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability\nto detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its\nstrong generalization ability.",

This trade-off bounds the entropy production\nrequired for one oscillatory period using the number of oscillations that occur\nbefore steady-state correlations are disrupted. The second is the thermodynamic\nspeed limit, which bounds the entropy production with the Euclidean length of\nthe limit cycle. These trade-offs are obtained by substituting mutually dual\nobservables, derived from the stability of the limit cycle, into the\nthermodynamic uncertainty relation.

    "abstract": "Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task,\nparticularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal\ndependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate\nthe lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training\ndiscriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer\nfrom two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly\nknowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and\nAnomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too\nclosely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting\nclassification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable\nanomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a\nCutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted\nmanner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision\nstrategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly\nshift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional\nnetwork to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive\nexperiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and\nESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated\ntraining data.

Here, we examine the generic band topology of\nBogoliubov de-Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians with $C_{2z}T$ symmetry, where $C_{2z}$\nand $T$ are twofold rotation about the $z$ axis and time-reversal symmetries,\nrespectively. We discuss the Euler band topology of superfluids and\nsuperconductors in the DIII and CI Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, where\nthe Euler class serves as an integer-valued topological invariant of the\n$4\\times4$ BdG Hamiltonian. Using expressions for the Euler class under\n$n$-fold rotational symmetry, we derive formulas relating the Euler class to\npreviously known topological invariants of class DIII and CI systems. We\ndemonstrate that three-dimensional class DIII topological phases with an odd\nwinding number, including the B phase of superfluid Helium 3, are topological\nsuperconductors or superfluids with a nontrivial Euler class. We refer to these\nas Euler superconductors or superfluids. Specifically, the $^3$He-B superfluid\nin a magnetic field is identified as an Euler superfluid. Three-dimensional\nclass CI topological phases with twice an odd winding number are also Euler\nsuperconductors or superfluids. When spatial inversion symmetry is present,\nclass CI superconductors with a nontrivial Euler class exhibit superconducting\nnodal lines with a linking structure. This phenomenon is demonstrated using a\nmodel of a three-dimensional $s_\\pm$-wave superconductor. These findings\nprovide a unified framework for exploring Euler band topology in superfluids\nand superconductors, connecting various phenomena associated with $T$-breaking\nperturbations, including Majorana Ising susceptibility and higher-order\ntopology.",

This freedom of movement is\nreferred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any\nposition (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees).

In this study, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to\ninvestigate the influence of cationic ligand-functionalized AuNP (CAuNP) size\nand CAuNP-to-DNA ratio on DNA wrapping and binding affinity. The obtained\nresults show that single DNA interacting with smaller CAuNPs exhibit greater\nbending and wrapping due to their higher curvature. However, when two DNAs bind\nto smaller CAuNPs, electrostatic repulsion prevents the effective wrapping\nwhich leads the DNAs to twist from their original orientation. Such behaviour\nis not observed with larger CAuNPs since their increased size may mitigates\nrepulsive forces. Further, the analysis on axial bending angle reveals that\nsmaller AuNPs induce sharper DNA bending and larger AuNPs promote smoother\nbending. In addition, the Potential of Mean Force (PMF) analysis confirms a\nstronger DNA binding affinity for larger AuNPs with affinity decreasing when\ntwo DNAs attach to a single CAuNP. Our results from the DNA loading capacity\ncalculations provide insights into the maximum number of DNA molecules that can\nbe loaded onto CAuNPs of a given size.

This extends our\nprevious single-electron approach, which was successfully applied to\ntwo-dimensional (2D) systems such as semiconductor quantum wells and graphene,\nwhere insights provided into both the IQHE and the fractional quantum Hall\neffect (FQHE). Starting from the graphene model, where the unconventional\nsequence of Hall plateaux, 2(2n+1), naturally emerges from Landau quantization,\nwe generalize the formulation to 3D semimetals with low carrier density and\nhigh mobility, where recent experiments have reported signatures of the QHE.\nFor 3D systems, the model accounts for strong band anisotropy by introducing an\neffective correction to the cyclotron frequency, and, also by considering large\neffective gyromagnetic factor, as observed in semimetallic materials. From the\ncalculated density of states and carrier concentration, we derive semiclassical\nexpressions for the diagonal and Hall conductivities. The resulting Hall\nconductivity exhibits quantized values in agreement with theoretical\npredictions and experimental observations of 3D quantum Hall states.\nSimulations reproduce both Hall plateaux and Shubnikov de Haas oscillations\nunder realistic parameter sets. Our results demonstrate that the IQHE in 3D\nsemimetals can be understood as a natural extension of the single-electron\nLandau quantization framework originally developed for 2D systems. This\nprovides a unified picture of quantum magnetotransport across dimensions,\nhighlighting the crucial role of low carrier density and high mobility.

Financial agents could invest in both firms and other investors, while\nbanks, introduced as investors with a credit multiplier, played a stabilizing\nor destabilizing role. Two types of interactions were considered within the\nfinancial sector: financial agents could either lend capital to or buy shares\nof other investors. We examined the collective states emerging from these\ninteractions. At the macro level, we identified multiple collective states,\neach characterized by distinct levels of average capital and investor\ndistribution across sectors. These states reflect the inherent instability of\nfinancial markets, with some configurations leading to default. At the micro\nlevel, we analyzed how returns and defaults propagate within a given collective\nstate, highlighting the critical role of banks in stabilizing or amplifying\nfinancial fluctuations. However, these results were derived under the\nassumption that financial connections were exogenous. The present paper removes\nthis assumption by modeling financial connections as dynamic endogenous\nvariables. Specifically, we extend the framework by introducing a field\nrepresentation of the network of financial relationships. The collective states\npreviously identified are now embedded in a broader class of states,\ncharacterized by the structure of investment shares among investors. We show\nthat these collective states consist of interconnected groups of agents, along\nwith their returns and disposable capital. Depending on the strength and form\nof connections between agents within each group, collective states may be\nstable or unstable, allowing for transitions between configurations. In each\ncollective state, some sectors may experience defaults. When the collective\nstate exhibits specific structural conditions, defaults may spread across a\nsignificant share of the group.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, ensuring safety, efficiency, and comfort in interactive\nautonomous driving has become a critical challenge. Traditional model-based\ntechniques, such as game-theoretic methods and robust control, are often overly\nconservative or computationally intensive. Conversely, learning-based\napproaches typically require extensive training data and frequently exhibit\nlimited interpretability and generalizability. Simpler strategies, such as Risk\nPotential Fields (RPF), provide lightweight alternatives with minimal data\ndemands but are inherently static and struggle to adapt effectively to dynamic\ntraffic conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Evolutionary\nRisk Potential Field (ERPF), a novel approach that dynamically updates risk\nassessments in dynamical scenarios based on historical obstacle proximity data.\nWe introduce a Risk-Ellipse construct that combines longitudinal reach and\nlateral uncertainty into a unified spatial temporal collision envelope.\nAdditionally, we define an adaptive Evolution Factor metric, computed through\nsigmoid normalization of Time to Collision (TTC) and Time-Window-of-Hazard\n(TWH), which dynamically adjusts the dimensions of the ellipse axes in real\ntime. This adaptive risk metric is integrated seamlessly into a Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) framework, enabling autonomous vehicles to proactively\naddress complex interactive driving scenarios in terms of uncertain driving of\nsurrounding vehicles. Comprehensive comparative experiments demonstrate that\nour ERPF-MPC approach consistently achieves smoother trajectories, higher\naverage speeds, and collision-free navigation, offering a robust and adaptive\nsolution suitable for complex interactive driving environments.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) involves planning efficient paths for\nmultiple agents to move simultaneously while avoiding collisions. In typical\nwarehouse environments, agents are often sparsely distributed along aisles.\nHowever, increasing the agent density can improve space efficiency. When the\nagent density is high, we must optimize the paths not only for goal-assigned\nagents but also for those obstructing them. This study proposes a novel MAPF\nframework for high-density environments (MAPF-HD). Several studies have\nexplored MAPF in similar settings using integer linear programming (ILP).\nHowever, ILP-based methods require substantial computation time to optimize all\nagent paths simultaneously. Even in small grid-based environments with fewer\nthan $100$ cells, these computations can incur tens to hundreds of seconds.\nThese high computational costs render these methods impractical for large-scale\napplications such as automated warehouses and valet parking. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce the phased null-agent swapping (PHANS) method. PHANS\nemploys a heuristic approach to incrementally swap positions between agents and\nempty vertices. This method solves the MAPF-HD problem within seconds to tens\nof seconds, even in large environments containing more than $700$ cells. The\nproposed method can potentially improve efficiency in various real-world\napplications such as warehouse logistics, traffic management, or crowd control.\nCode is available at https://github.com/ToyotaCRDL/MAPF-in-High-Density-Envs.",

A key challenge for these analyses is\nthe correction for detector distortions, known as deconvolution or unfolding.\nBinned unfolding of cross section measurements traditionally rely on the\nregularized inversion of the response matrix that represents the detector\nresponse, mapping pre-detector (`particle level') observables to post-detector\n(`detector level') observables. In this paper we introduce Neural Posterior\nUnfolding, a modern, Bayesian approach that leverages normalizing flows for\nunfolding. By using normalizing flows for neural posterior estimation, NPU\noffers several key advantages including implicit regularization through the\nneural network architecture, fast amortized inference that eliminates the need\nfor repeated retraining, and direct access to the full uncertainty in the\nunfolded result. In addition to introducing NPU, we implement a classical\nBayesian unfolding method called Fully Bayesian Unfolding (FBU) in modern\nPython so it can also be studied. These tools are validated on simple Gaussian\nexamples and then tested on simulated jet substructure examples from the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC). We find that the Bayesian methods are effective and\nworth additional development to be analysis ready for cross section\nmeasurements at the LHC and beyond.",

As the primary architects of XR applications, developers play a\ncritical role in addressing novel threats.

Despite the growing importance of this issue, there is a lack of\nin-depth, threat-aware studies that examine XR S&P from the developers'\nperspective. To fill this gap, we interviewed 23 professional XR developers\nwith a focus on emerging threats in XR. Our study addresses two research\nquestions aiming to uncover existing problems in XR development and identify\nactionable paths forward.\n  By examining developers' perceptions of S&P threats, we found that: (1) XR\ndevelopment decisions (e.g., rich sensor data collection, user-generated\ncontent interfaces) are closely tied to and can amplify S&P threats, yet\ndevelopers are often unaware of these risks, resulting in cognitive biases in\nthreat perception; and (2) limitations in existing mitigation methods, combined\nwith insufficient strategic, technical, and communication support, undermine\ndevelopers' motivation, awareness, and ability to effectively address these\nthreats. Based on these findings, we propose actionable and stakeholder-aware\nrecommendations to improve XR S&P throughout the XR development process.

We also show our cost\nfunction exhibits a barren-plateau-free region near the initial parameters at\neach iteration in the training landscape.

However, studies so far have mainly considered initial\nlocalized states, whose driven dynamics follow the Kibble-Zurek mechanism\n(KZM). In this study, we investigate the driven dynamics of the localization\nphase transition in the Aubry-Andr\\'e (AA) model starting from a gapless\nextended state, which violates the adiabatic-impulse scenario of KZM. By\nlinearly driving the quasiperiodic potential strength across the critical\npoint, we numerically simulate the driven dynamics and analyze the scaling\nbehavior of both the inverse participation ratio ($\\mathcal{I}$) and the\ndynamic deviation from the instantaneous ground state energy $(\\mathcal{D})$.\nWe demonstrate that the driven dynamics starting from initially extended states\nsatisfies the criterion for the applicability of KZM and its extension,\nfinite-time scaling (FTS). The scaling functions governing the driven dynamics\nof both $\\mathcal{I}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ have been derived based on FTS and\nnumerically validated. We found that the scaling functions exhibit significant\ndifferences at large $R$ and small $R$, and also differ considerably from the\nscaling functions when the initial state is localized, highlighting the crucial\nrole of initial state behavior. The established scaling laws remain robust\nacross a wide range of system sizes and driving rates, providing testable\npredictions for experimental realizations.",

The issue remained unsettled until 2024, when BESIII, with an\nenlarged $e^{+}e^{-} \\to D\\bar{D}$ sample, confirmed the presence of the\n$G(3900)$ structure, reviving discussion of its nature. Although it has been\nproposed as a $P$-wave $D\\bar{D}^{*}$ molecular state, no consensus has\nemerged, and interference effects remain a plausible explanation. In this\nLetter, we show that analyzing the $e^{+}e^{-}\\to D\\bar{D}$ cross section as a\nfunction of the transverse momentum of the final-state $D$ meson reveals a\nprominent Jacobian peak. This feature cannot be generated by interference\neffects alone and thus provides direct evidence for the existence of $G(3900)$.\nMoreover, the peak position is highly sensitive to the actual mass of\n$G(3900)$, offering a precise determination method. Our results further\nindicate that interpreting $G(3900)$ as a $D\\bar{D}^{*}$ molecular state is\ndisfavored, suggesting alternative internal structures.

Extensive tests on\nmulti-dimensional subsonic to hypersonic flows demonstrate that our GPU-based\nhigh-performance solver achieves one to two orders of magnitude faster\nconvergence compared to previous explicit solvers.

Recent fine-grained MoE designs\nintroduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per\ntoken, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers\nare optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely\nand enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance\nand efficiency. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few\nhighly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced\nrouting decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per\ntoken introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or\nredesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&Pick, a post-training,\nplug-and-play strategy for smarter MoE routing. Pick discovers and reinforces\nkey experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to\nnotable accuracy gains across domains. Ban complements this by dynamically\npruning redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering\nfaster inference with minimal accuracy loss.

A conjecture of Voss from 1991 asserts\nthat if disjoint bridges $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_k$ of a longest cycle $L$ in a\n$2$-connected graph overlap in a tree-like manner (i.e., induce a tree in the\n{\\it overlap graph} of $L$), then the total {\\it length} of these bridges is at\nmost half the length of $L$. Voss established this for $k \\leq 3$ and used it\nas a key tool in his 1991 monograph on cycles and bridges. In this paper, we\nconfirm the conjecture in full via a reduction to a cycle covering problem.",

    "abstract": "This work resolves the optimal average-case cost of the Disk-Inspection\nproblem, a variant of Bellman's 1955 lost-in-a-forest problem. In\nDisk-Inspection, a mobile agent starts at the center of a unit disk and follows\na trajectory that inspects perimeter points whenever the disk does not obstruct\nvisibility. The worst-case cost was solved optimally in 1957 by Isbell, but the\naverage-case version remained open, with heuristic upper bounds proposed by\nGluss in 1961 and improved only recently.\n  Our approach applies Fermat's Principle of Least Time to a recently proposed\ndiscretization framework, showing that optimal solutions are captured by a\none-parameter family of recurrences independent of the discretization size. In\nthe continuum limit these recurrences give rise to a single-parameter optimal\ncontrol problem, whose trajectories coincide with limiting solutions of the\noriginal Disk-Inspection problem. A crucial step is proving that the optimal\ninitial condition generates a trajectory that avoids the unit disk, thereby\nvalidating the optics formulation and reducing the many-variable optimization\nto a rigorous one-parameter problem. In particular, this disproves Gluss's\nconjecture that optimal trajectories must touch the disk.\n  Our analysis determines the exact optimal average-case inspection cost, equal\nto $3.549259\\ldots$ and certified to at least six digits of accuracy.",

In this work, we propose a\nnovel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation\nproblem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly\nsimplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic\ndescriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each\nimage patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce\nimage-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of\nsegmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling\npipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding\n(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of\nsemantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\\times$, without\ncompromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg\nachieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.\nTo further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic\ndescriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and\nrepresents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This\nleads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a\nnext-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative\nefficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets\nshow that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across\ndiverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining\ncompatible with existing MLLM backbones.

    "abstract": "Glasses are mechanically rigid, still undergo structural relaxation which\nchanges their properties and affects potential technological applications.\nUnderstanding the underlying physical processes is a problem of broad\ntheoretical and practical interest. We investigate intermittent structural\nrelaxation events or ``avalanches'' occurring inside glassy regime. Contrary to\nthe more well-known avalanches due to shear, here they are induced by thermal\nfluctuations in undeformed glass. By analyzing changes in structural,\nmechanical, dynamical, topological and vibrational properties of the system, we\nprovide a multi-faceted characterization of avalanches. Overall we find that\nthe system softens due to avalanches. Further, we develop a formalism to\nextract local measures of non-Affine displacement and tensorial strain for\nthermal amorphous solids in absence of any external deformation. Our analysis\nhighlights a key difference between two types of driving: while the shear\ndeformation response is dominated by volume preserving deviatoric strain,\nchanges in local density must be considered to model response of undeformed\nglass under thermal noise. The observations suggest the idea of Generalized\nStrain Transformation Zones (GSTZ), where coupled shear and volume-changing\ndeformations govern thermally-mediated plasticity. Our work paves the way for a\nunified description of elasto-plastic response of (athermal) mechanically\ndeformed and thermally driven undeformed glasses.",

This work combines two\ncomplementary strategies to address these challenges. The first is bias\ntailoring, which aligns stabilizers with the dominant error type. The second is\nsingle-shot (SS) decoding, which uses metachecks to identify measurement faults\nfrom just one noisy round. We implement these ideas in a four-dimensional\nlifted hypergraph product (4D-LHP) code constructed from quasi-cyclic\nprotograph seeds. Simulation results show that bias tailoring lowers the\nword-error rate (WER) by 20-60 percent across realistic Z:X bias ratios (from\n1:1 up to 1000:1), with the largest improvements at moderate bias. When\nmeasurement noise is present, a single SS round recovers more than one third of\nthe performance lost to readout errors. Moreover, metachecks identify over 99.8\npercent of faulty syndromes, providing near-complete fault visibility even with\nlimited correction power. Together, these findings demonstrate that 4D-LHP\ncodes maintain strong resilience under realistic noise, making them promising\ncandidates for integration into orchestrated QPU-CPU workflows.",

    "abstract": "A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent\nembeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks\noften produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode\noverlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering\ngeneralization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss\nprovide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a\nfailure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly\nquantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices\nderived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics\nagainst a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact,\ninterpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality.\nWe validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST\nvariants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple\narchitectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low\nrho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction\nerror, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse.\nEstimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower\nbounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen\nEstimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C)\ncan guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware\nregularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across\nmodels and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool\nfor evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.",

To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided\nConsistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly\ncaptures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning\nthrough a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core\ncomponents: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided\nRepresentation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal\nfeatures to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are\nthen used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a\ndual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level\nrepresentations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness\nand inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation\nin CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation\nlearning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we\nconstruct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action\nrecognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD\napproaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of\ntemporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will\nbe publicly available.",

Accurate characterization is therefore essential yet\ndifficult when states cannot be reconstructed with sparse Pauli measurements.\nTomography must work with dense measurement bases, high-dimensional Hilbert\nspaces, and often sample-based data. However, existing convex\noptimization-based techniques are not efficient enough and scale poorly when\nextended to large and multi-mode systems. In this work, we explore convex\noptimization as an effective framework to address problems in bosonic state\ntomography, introducing three techniques to enhance efficiency and scalability:\nefficient displacement operator computation, Hilbert space truncation, and\nstochastic convex optimization, which mitigate common limitations of existing\napproaches. Then we propose a sample-based, convex maximum-likelihood\nestimation (MLE) method specifically designed for flying mode tomography.\nNumerical simulations of flying four-mode and nine-mode problems demonstrate\nthe accuracy and practicality of our methods.

As a\nresult, it often leads to insufficient approximations and practical deviations\nfrom this guiding intuition. Recent work has achieved a more accurate\napproximation of linear-layer outputs within the framework of layer-wise PTQ,\nbut such refinements remain inadequate for achieving alignment with the full\nmodel output. Based on a deeper understanding of the structural characteristics\nof mainstream LLMs, we propose $LoaQ$, an output-approximation method for\nlayer-wise PTQ that explicitly targets output-level consistency. It better\naligns with this intuition and can feature a simple closed-form solution,\nmaking it orthogonal to existing techniques and readily integrable into\nexisting quantization pipelines. Experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen model\nfamilies demonstrate that LoaQ performs effectively in both weight-only and\nweight-activation joint quantization.

    "abstract": "Ramsey interferometry, a cornerstone technique in quantum spectroscopy,\ntraditionally operates with qubits for high precision measurements. In this\nwork we build on Ramsey interferometry, extending it to qudits in\nWigner-Majorana (WM) systems where the internal degrees of freedom are used to\nachieve enhanced resolution. We also show that replacing the two $\\pi/2$ pulses\nof standard Ramsey interferometry with the quantum Fourier transform provides\nno increase in resolution. Theoretical analysis further reveals that quantum\nsystems with the WM symmetry are particularly well-suited for this objective,\nachieving substantial resolution improvements for a given interrogation time.\nSimulations and analytical solutions validate these predictions, confirming the\nfeasibility and advantages of qudits in Ramsey interferometry. We quantify\nthese advantages using a resolution--contrast index that enables direct\ncomparison between different qudit dimensions. In particular, three state\nsystems (qutrits) achieve a twofold resolution increase compared to qubits\nwithout contrast degradation, emerging as optimal for the qudit approach.\nHigher dimensional qudits achieve superior resolution enhancement at the cost\nof contrast degradation. These significant resolution gains establish qudits as\nattractive candidates for high-precision quantum metrology and sensing\ntechnologies.",

    "abstract": "Contextual bandit algorithms have transformed modern experimentation by\nenabling real-time adaptation for personalized treatment and efficient use of\ndata. Yet these advantages create challenges for statistical inference due to\nadaptivity. A fundamental property that supports valid inference is policy\nconvergence, meaning that action-selection probabilities converge in\nprobability given the context. Convergence ensures replicability of adaptive\nexperiments and stability of online algorithms. In this paper, we highlight a\npreviously overlooked issue: widely used algorithms such as LinUCB may fail to\nconverge when the reward model is misspecified, and such non-convergence\ncreates fundamental obstacles for statistical inference. This issue is\npractically important, as misspecified models -- such as linear approximations\nof complex dynamic system -- are often employed in real-world adaptive\nexperiments to balance bias and variance.\n  Motivated by this insight, we propose and analyze a broad class of algorithms\nthat are guaranteed to converge even under model misspecification. Building on\nthis guarantee, we develop a general inference framework based on an\ninverse-probability-weighted Z-estimator (IPW-Z) and establish its asymptotic\nnormality with a consistent variance estimator. Simulation studies confirm that\nthe proposed method provides robust and data-efficient confidence intervals,\nand can outperform existing approaches that exist only in the special case of\noffline policy evaluation. Taken together, our results underscore the\nimportance of designing adaptive algorithms with built-in convergence\nguarantees to enable stable experimentation and valid statistical inference in\npractice.",

    "abstract": "There has not been an established mathematical measure of evidence. Some\nBayesians have argued that probability can be an objectively correct measure of\n``rational degrees of belief,'' which we do not distinguish from evidence.\nHowever, support for the objectivist view has been limited due to the lack of a\ngeneral method for assigning probabilities to evidence (belief) de novo. The\nstandard axioms of Kolmogorov and Cox solve only the calculation problem,\nspecifying how probabilities can be calculated from other probabilities. They\ndo not solve the measurement problem of how to determine the uniquely correct\nvalue of P(A) given only A. The prototypical solution has always been Laplace's\nprinciple of indifference, which assigns equal (uniform) probabilities to all\npossibilities. However, uniformity is well known to be inconsistent with the\nstandard axioms when there are infinite possibilities. Here we introduce new\naxioms that resolve this inconsistency. We first show that all measures must\nultimately be based on uniformity, and that uniformity is inevitable if all\npropositions are adequately defined. We then reconcile uniformity with infinite\npossibilities by using hyperrational numbers, so that an infinite sum of\ninfinitesimal probabilities can equal one. Our axioms thereby provide a general\nand relatively simple solution to the measurement problem. We discuss a variety\nof conceptual obstacles that have made this solution difficult to recognize.",

However, in geometrically degenerate or narrow environments,\nregistration problems become ill-conditioned, leading to unstable solutions and\ndegraded accuracy. While existing approaches attempt to handle these issues,\nthey fail to address the core challenge: accurately detection, interpret, and\nresolve this ill-conditioning, leading to missed detections or corrupted\nsolutions. In this study, we introduce DCReg, a principled framework that\nsystematically addresses the ill-conditioned registration problems through\nthree integrated innovations. First, DCReg achieves reliable ill-conditioning\ndetection by employing a Schur complement decomposition to the hessian matrix.\nThis technique decouples the registration problem into clean rotational and\ntranslational subspaces, eliminating coupling effects that mask degeneracy\npatterns in conventional analyses. Second, within these cleanly subspaces, we\ndevelop quantitative characterization techniques that establish explicit\nmappings between mathematical eigenspaces and physical motion directions,\nproviding actionable insights about which specific motions lack constraints.\nFinally, leveraging this clean subspace, we design a targeted mitigation\nstrategy: a novel preconditioner that selectively stabilizes only the\nidentified ill-conditioned directions while preserving all well-constrained\ninformation in observable space. This enables efficient and robust optimization\nvia the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method with a single physical\ninterpretable parameter. Extensive experiments demonstrate DCReg achieves at\nleast 20% - 50% improvement in localization accuracy and 5-100 times speedup\nover state-of-the-art methods across diverse environments.

Because of the high costs associated\nwith mammalian cell cultures, obtaining high cell densities to produce high\nproduct titers is desired. These bioprocesses require high concentrations of\nnutrients in the basal media and periodically adding concentrated feed media to\nsustain cell growth and therapeutic protein productivity. Unfortunately, the\ndesired or optimal nutrient concentrations of the feed media are often\nsolubility limited due to precipitation of chemical complexes that form in the\nsolution. Experimentally screening the various cell culture media\nconfigurations which contain 50 to 100 compounds can be expensive and\nlaborious. This article lays the foundation for utilizing computational tools\nto understand precipitation of nutrients in cell culture media by studying the\npairwise interactions between amino acids in thermodynamic models. Activity\ncoefficient data for one amino acid in water and amino acid solubility data of\ntwo amino acids in water have been used to determine a single set of UNIFAC\ngroup interaction parameters to predict the thermodynamic behavior of the\nmulti-component systems found in mammalian cell culture media. The data\ncollected in this study is, to our knowledge, the largest set of ternary system\namino acid solubility data reported to date.

Competitive inhibition of an enzyme occurs when an\ninhibitor binds to the enzyme's binding site and blocks the enzyme's target\nmolecule from binding. We recently proposed a detailed but straightforward mass\naction model for competitive inhibition of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) by\nTerazosin (TZ). The full PGK1 model has two substrates and two products which\ncan be bound and released in either order, known as a random bi-bi mechanism.\nThis model, with no further modification, predicts an increased reaction rate\nat low or moderate TZ doses, suggesting that stimulation is an intrinsic\nfeature of competitive inhibition in enzymes with two products. This mechanism\ncan aid in the development of novel therapies, particularly since enzyme\nactivators are more rare and difficult to design than inhibitors. Here we\npropose a three-timescale reduction of that detailed model and show that the\nresulting rate equation retains three essential attributes of competitive\ninhibitor stimulation. These attributes are the biphasic dose response, the\ndependence on the relative rates of product dissociation from the binary and\nternary complexes, and the parameter region where stimulation is possible. The\nresulting rate equation is a rational function which is a Monod function of\neach substrate, but quadratic in the denominator as a function of inhibitor\ndose.",

This\nsingle degree of freedom ties the magnitude of noise directly to both privacy\nloss and utility degradation, preventing independent control of these two\nfactors. The problem becomes more pronounced when the number of composition\nrounds T and batch size B vary across tasks, as these variations induce\ntask-dependent shifts in the privacy-utility trade-off, where small changes in\nnoise parameters can disproportionately affect model accuracy.

In this paper, we consider the synthesis\nof timed regular expressions, focusing on generating a timed regular expression\nconsistent with a given set of system behaviors including positive and negative\nexamples, i.e., accepting all positive examples and rejecting all negative\nexamples. We first prove the decidability of the synthesis problem through an\nexploration of simple timed regular expressions. Subsequently, we propose our\nmethod of generating a consistent timed regular expression with minimal length,\nwhich unfolds in two steps. The first step is to enumerate and prune candidate\nparametric timed regular expressions. In the second step, we encode the\nrequirement that a candidate generated by the first step is consistent with the\ngiven set into a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) formula, which is\nconsequently solved to determine a solution to parametric time constraints.\nFinally, we evaluate our approach on benchmarks, including randomly generated\nbehaviors from target timed models and a case study.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques have\nsignificantly increased demand for serving quantized large language models\n(LLMs), enabling higher throughput and substantially reduced memory usage with\nminimal accuracy loss. Quantized models address memory constraints in LLMs and\nenhance GPU resource utilization through efficient GPU sharing. However,\nquantized models have smaller KV block sizes than non-quantized models, causing\nlimited memory efficiency due to memory fragmentation. Also, distinct resource\nusage patterns between quantized and non-quantized models require efficient\nscheduling to maximize throughput. To address these challenges, we propose\nFineServe, an inference serving framework for mixed-precision LLMs. FineServe's\nkey contributions include: (1) KV Slab, a precision-aware adaptive memory\nmanagement technique dynamically allocating KV cache based on model\nquantization characteristics, significantly reducing GPU memory fragmentation,\nand (2) a two-level scheduling framework comprising a global scheduler that\nplaces models to GPUs based on request rates, latency SLOs, and memory\nconstraints and efficiency, and a local scheduler that adaptively adjusts batch\nsizes according to real-time request fluctuations. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x\nhigher token generation throughput compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing\nsystems.",

This paper introduces MelodyBedScale, a non-intrusive and\nrapid on-bed weight estimation system that leverages bed vibration induced by\nmusic. The core insight is that body weight affects the vibration transfer\nfunction of the bed-body system, which is captured using vibration sensors\nplaced on opposite sides of the bed. First, we identify weight-sensitive\nfrequency bands and compose clinically acceptable soft, natural music with high\nsignal energy in these frequency bands. This music is then played through a\nspeaker mounted on the bed to induce bed vibrations. Additionally, to\nefficiently capture the complex weight-vibration relationship with limited data\nand enhance generalizability to unseen individuals and weights, we\ntheoretically analyze the weight-vibration relationship and integrate the\nresults into the activation functions of the neural network for\nphysics-informed weight regression.

Inductive invariants are inductive formulas that\noverapproximate the reachable states of a system and imply a desired safety\nproperty. However, inductive invariants are notoriously complex, which makes\ninductive invariant inference a challenging problem. In this work, we observe\nthat inductive invariant formulas are complex primarily because they must be\nclosed over the transition relation of an entire system. Therefore, we propose\na new approach in which we decompose a system into components, assign an\nassume-guarantee contract to each component, and prove that each component\nfulfills its contract by inferring a local inductive invariant. The key\nadvantage of local inductive invariant inference is that the local invariant\nneed only be closed under the transition relation for the component, which is\nsimpler than the transition relation for the entire system. Once local\ninvariant inference is complete, system-wide safety follows by construction\nbecause the conjunction of all local invariants becomes an inductive invariant\nfor the entire system. We apply our compositional inductive invariant inference\ntechnique to two case studies, in which we provide evidence that our framework\ncan infer invariants more efficiently than the global technique. Our case\nstudies also show that local inductive invariants provide modular insights\nabout a specification that are not offered by global invariants.",
