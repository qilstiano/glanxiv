    "abstract": "Inspired by the possibility of emergent supersymmetry in critical random\nsystems, we study a field theory model with a quartic potential of one\nsuperfield, possessing the Parisi-Sourlas supertranslation symmetry. Within\nperturbative $\\epsilon$ expansion, we find nine non-trivial scale invariant\nrenormalization group fixed points, but only one of them is conformal. We,\nhowever, believe scale invariance without conformal invariance cannot occur\nwithout a sophisticated mechanism because it predicts the existence of a\nnon-conserved but non-renormalized vector operator called virial current, whose\nexistence must be non-generic. We show that the virial current in this model is\nrelated to the supercurrent by supertranslation. The supertranslation\nWard-Takahashi identity circumvents the genericity argument, explaining its\nnon-renormalization property.",

    "abstract": "The Rayleigh--Taylor instability (RTI) is an ubiquitous phenomenon that\noccurs in inertial-confinement-fusion (ICF) implosions and is recognized as an\nimportant limiting factor of ICF performance. To analytically understand the\nRTI dynamics and its impact on ICF capsule implosions, we develop a\nfirst-principle variational theory that describes an imploding spherical shell\nundergoing RTI. The model is based on a thin-shell approximation and includes\nthe dynamical coupling between the imploding spherical shell and an\nadiabatically compressed fluid within its interior. Using a quasilinear\nanalysis, we study the degradation trends of key ICF performance metrics (e.g.,\nstagnation pressure, residual kinetic energy, and aerial density) as functions\nof initial RTI parameters (e.g., the initial amplitude and Legendre mode), as\nwell as the 1D implosion characteristics (e.g., the convergence ratio). We\ncompare analytical results from the theory against nonlinear results obtained\nby numerically integrating the governing equations of this reduced model. Our\nfindings emphasize the need to incorporate polar flows in the calculation of\nresidual kinetic energy and demonstrate that higher convergence ratios in ICF\nimplosions lead to significantly greater degradation of key performance\nmetrics.",

While observations have suggested a strong\nconnection between the dynamics of sea ice and the underlying turbulent flows,\nquantifying this relationship remains an ambitious task due to the challenges\nof acquiring concurrent sea ice and ocean measurements. Recently, an innovative\nstudy using a unique algorithm to track sea ice floes showed that ice floes can\nbe used as vorticity meters of the ocean. Here, we present a numerical and\nanalytical evaluation of this result by estimating the kinematic link between\nfree-drifting ice floes and underlying ocean eddies using idealized vortex\nmodels. These analyses are expanded to explore local eddies in\nquasi-geostrophic turbulence, providing a more realistic representation of\neddies in the Arctic Ocean. We find that in both flow fields, the relationship\nbetween floe rotation rates and ocean vorticity depends on the relative size of\nthe ice floe to the eddy. As the floe size approaches and exceeds the eddy\nsize, the floe rotation rates depart from half of the ocean vorticity. Finally,\nthe effects of ice floe thickness, atmospheric winds, and floe-floe collisions\non floe rotations are investigated. The derived relations and floe statistics\nset the foundation for leveraging remote sensing observations of floe motions\nto characterize eddy vorticity at small to moderate scales. This innovative\napproach opens new possibilities for quantifying Arctic Ocean eddy\ncharacteristics, providing valuable inputs for more accurate climate\nprojections.",

    "abstract": "We study the effect of incorporating self-supervised denoising as a\npre-processing step for training deep learning (DL) based reconstruction\nmethods on data corrupted by Gaussian noise. K-space data employed for training\nare typically multi-coil and inherently noisy. Although DL-based reconstruction\nmethods trained on fully sampled data can enable high reconstruction quality,\nobtaining large, noise-free datasets is impractical. We leverage Generalized\nStein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (GSURE) for denoising. We evaluate two DL-based\nreconstruction methods: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Model-Based\nDeep Learning (MoDL). We evaluate the impact of denoising on the performance of\nthese DL-based methods in solving accelerated multi-coil magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) reconstruction. The experiments were carried out on T2-weighted\nbrain and fat-suppressed proton-density knee scans. We observed that\nself-supervised denoising enhances the quality and efficiency of MRI\nreconstructions across various scenarios. Specifically, employing denoised\nimages rather than noisy counterparts when training DL networks results in\nlower normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), higher structural similarity\nindex measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) across different SNR\nlevels, including 32dB, 22dB, and 12dB for T2-weighted brain data, and 24dB,\n14dB, and 4dB for fat-suppressed knee data. Overall, we showed that denoising\nis an essential pre-processing technique capable of improving the efficacy of\nDL-based MRI reconstruction methods under diverse conditions. By refining the\nquality of input data, denoising enables training more effective DL networks,\npotentially bypassing the need for noise-free reference MRI scans.",

In traditional computer vision tasks,\ncreative or approximate answers may be acceptable, but in healthcare, precision\nis paramount.Current large multimodal models like Gemini and GPT-4o are\ninsufficient for medical tasks due to their reliance on memorized internet\nknowledge rather than the nuanced expertise required in healthcare. VLMs are\nusually trained in three stages: vision pre-training, vision-language\npre-training, and instruction fine-tuning (IFT). IFT has been typically applied\nusing a mixture of generic and healthcare data. In contrast, we propose that\nfor medical VLMs, a fourth stage of specialized IFT is necessary, which focuses\non medical data and includes information from domain expert models. Domain\nexpert models developed for medical use are crucial because they are\nspecifically trained for certain clinical tasks, e.g. to detect tumors and\nclassify abnormalities through segmentation and classification, which learn\nfine-grained features of medical data$-$features that are often too intricate\nfor a VLM to capture effectively especially in radiology. This paper introduces\na new framework, VILA-M3, for medical VLMs that utilizes domain knowledge via\nexpert models. Through our experiments, we show an improved state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance with an average improvement of ~9% over the prior SOTA model\nMed-Gemini and ~6% over models trained on the specific tasks.

In contrast to conventional\nmethodologies, which concentrate on developing specific generalized models, our\nframework, MLDGG, endeavors to achieve adaptable generalization across diverse\ndomains by integrating cross-multi-domain meta-learning with structure learning\nand semantic identification. Initially, it introduces a generalized structure\nlearner to mitigate the adverse effects of task-unrelated edges, enhancing the\ncomprehensiveness of representations learned by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nwhile capturing shared structural information across domains.

In the\ncontext of meta-learning, meta-parameters for both learners are optimized to\nfacilitate knowledge transfer and enable effective adaptation to graphs through\nfine-tuning within the target domains, where target graphs are inaccessible\nduring training.

The observed negative elliptic flow $v_2$, at midrapidity has been\nexplained either via (in-plane) shadowing or via (out-of-plane) squeeze-out. To\nsettle this question, we employ the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular\nDynamics model (UrQMD) to calculate Au+Au collisions at E$_\\mathrm{lab}=0.6A$\nGeV, E$_\\mathrm{lab}=1.23A$ GeV and $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}=3.0$ GeV using a hard\nSkyrme type Equation-of-State to calculate the time evolution and generation of\ndirected flow and elliptic flow. We quantitatively distinguish the impact of\ncollisions and of the potential on $v_1$ and $v_2$ during the evolution of the\nsystem. These calculations reveal that in this energy regime the generation of\n$v_1$ and $v_2$ follows from a highly intricate interplay of different\nprocesses and is created late, after the system has reached its highest density\nand has created a matter bridge between projectile and target remnant, which\nlater breaks. Initially, we find a strong out-of-plane pressure. Then follows a\nstrong stopping and the built up of an in-plane pressure. The $v_2$, created by\nboth processes, compensate to a large extend. The finally observed $v_2$ is\ncaused by the potential, reflects the freeze-out geometry and can neither be\nassociated to squeeze-out nor to shadowing.\n  The results are highly relevant for experiments at GSI, RHIC-FXT and the\nupcoming FAIR facility, but also for experiments at FRIB, and strengthens\nunderstanding on the Equation-of-State at large baryon densities.",

We delve\ninto how these materials enable possibilities, such as symmetry control, phase\nmatching, and integration into photonic circuits. The fusion of 2D materials\nwith nonlinear optics provides insights into the fundamental behaviors of\nelementary excitations such as electrons, excitons, and photons in low\ndimensional systems and has the potential to transform the landscape of\nnext-generation photonic and quantum technologies.",

To operate the network on a global scale, the\nquantum light source should emit at telecommunication wavelengths with minimum\npropagation losses. A cornerstone for the operation of such a quantum network\nis the demonstration of quantum teleportation. Here we realize full-photonic\nquantum teleportation employing one of the most promising platforms, i.e.\nsemiconductor quantum dots, which can fulfill all the aforementioned\nrequirements. Two remote quantum dots are used, one as a source of entangled\nphoton pairs and the other as a single-photon source. The frequency mismatch\nbetween the triggered sources is erased using two polarization-preserving\nquantum frequency converters, enabling a Bell state measurement at\ntelecommunication wavelengths. A post-selected teleportation fidelity of up to\n0.721(33) is achieved, significantly above the classical limit, demonstrating\nsuccessful quantum teleportation between light generated by distinct sources.\nThese results mark a major advance for the semiconductor platform as a source\nof quantum light fulfilling a key requirement for a scalable quantum network.\nThis becomes particularly relevant after the seminal breakthrough of addressing\na nuclear spin in semiconductor quantum dots demonstrating long coherence\ntimes, thus fulfilling another crucial step towards a scalable quantum network.",

Consequently, gradient compression has been proposed as\na means of increasing optimization throughput. In general, due to information\nloss, compression introduces a penalty on the number of iterations needed to\nreach a solution. In this work, we investigate how the iteration penalty\ndepends on the interaction between compression and problem structure, in the\ncontext of non-convex stochastic optimization. We focus on linear schemes,\nwhere compression and decompression can be modeled as multiplication with a\nrandom matrix. We consider several distributions of matrices, among them\nHaar-distributed orthogonal matrices and matrices with random Gaussian entries.\nWe find that the impact of compression on convergence can be quantified in\nterms of a smoothness matrix associated with the objective function, using a\nnorm defined by the compression scheme. The analysis reveals that in certain\ncases, compression performance is related to low-rank structure or other\nspectral properties of the problem and our bounds predict that the penalty\nintroduced by compression is significantly reduced compared to worst-case\nbounds that only consider the compression level, ignoring problem data.

The prevalence of\ndystonia ranges from 2 to 50 per million, and chorea from 5 to 10 per 100,000.\nThese conditions are often diagnosed with delays averaging 4.75 to 7.83 years.\nTraditional diagnostic methods depend on clinical history and expert physical\nexaminations, but specialized tests are ineffective due to the complex\npathophysiology of these disorders. This study develops a neural network model\nto differentiate between dystonia and chorea from video recordings of\npaediatric patients performing motor tasks. The model integrates a Graph\nConvolutional Network (GCN) to capture spatial relationships and Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to account for temporal dynamics. Attention\nmechanisms were incorporated to improve model interpretability. The model was\ntrained and validated on a dataset of 50 videos (31 chorea-predominant, 19\ndystonia-predominant) collected under regulatory approval from Guy's and St\nThomas' NHS Foundation Trust. The model achieved 85% accuracy, 81% sensitivity,\nand 88% specificity at 15 frames per second. Attention maps highlighted the\nmodel's ability to correctly identify involuntary movement patterns, with\nmisclassifications often due to occluded body parts or subtle movement\nvariations. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning to improve\nthe accuracy and efficiency of HMD diagnosis and could contribute to more\nreliable, interpretable clinical tools.",

The scenarios\nsynthesized by ProSec trigger 25x more vulnerable code than a normal\ninstruction-tuning dataset, resulting in a security-focused alignment dataset\n7x larger than the previous work.

Besides, almost all\ncommon CNN models adopt \"train-and-use\" strategy where the structure is\npre-defined and the kernel parameters are fixed after the training with the\nsame structure and set of parameters used for all data without considering the\ncontent complexity. In this paper, we propose a new CNN framework, named as\n$\\textit{Puppet-CNN}$, which contains two modules: a $\\textit{puppet module}$\nand a $\\textit{puppeteer module}$. The puppet module is a CNN model used to\nactually process the input data just like other works, but its depth and\nkernels are generated by the puppeteer module (realized with Ordinary\nDifferential Equation (ODE)) based on the input complexity each time. By\nrecurrently generating kernel parameters in the puppet module, we can take\nadvantage of the dependence among kernels of different convolutional layers to\nsignificantly reduce the size of CNN model by only storing and training the\nparameters of the much smaller puppeteer ODE module.

    "abstract": "The width of the magnetic hysteresis loop is often correlated with the\nmaterial's magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant $\\kappa_1$. Traditionally, a\ncommon approach to reduce the hysteresis width has been to develop alloys with\n$\\kappa_1$ as close to zero as possible. However, contrary to this widely\naccepted view, we present evidence that magnetoelastic interactions governed by\nmagnetostriction constants, elastic stiffness, and applied stresses play an\nimportant role in reducing magnetic hysteresis width, despite large $\\kappa_1$\nvalues. We use a nonlinear micromagnetics framework to systematically\ninvestigate the interplay between material constants $\\lambda_{100}$, $c_{11}$,\n$c_{12}$, $\\kappa_1$, applied or residual stresses $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{R}}$, and\nneedle domains to collectively lower the energy barrier for magnetization\nreversal. A distinguishing feature of our work is that we correlate the energy\nbarrier governing the growth of needle domains with the width of the hysteresis\nloop. This energy barrier approach enables us to capture the nuanced interplay\nbetween anisotropy constant, magnetostriction, and applied stresses, and their\ncombined influence on magnetic hysteresis. We propose a mathematical\nrelationship on the coercivity map: $\\kappa_1 =\n\\alpha(c_{11}-c_{12})(\\lambda_{100}+\\beta\\sigma_{11})^2$ for which magnetic\nhysteresis can be minimized for a uniaxial residual stress $\\sigma_\\mathrm{R} =\n\\sigma_{11}\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1\\otimes\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1$ (and for some constants\n$\\alpha$, $\\beta$). These results serve as quantitative guidelines to design\nmagnetic alloys with small hysteresis, and potentially guide the discovery of a\nnew generation of soft magnets located beyond the $\\kappa_1 \\to 0$ region.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has proven very promising for interpreting MRI in brain tumor\ndiagnosis. However, deep learning models suffer from a scarcity of brain MRI\ndatasets for effective training. Self-supervised learning (SSL) models provide\ndata-efficient and remarkable solutions to limited dataset problems. Therefore,\nthis paper introduces a generative SSL model for brain tumor classification in\ntwo stages. The first stage is designed to pre-train a Residual Vision\nTransformer (ResViT) model for MRI synthesis as a pretext task. The second\nstage includes fine-tuning a ResViT-based classifier model as a downstream\ntask. Accordingly, we aim to leverage local features via CNN and global\nfeatures via ViT, employing a hybrid CNN-transformer architecture for ResViT in\npretext and downstream tasks. Moreover, synthetic MRI images are utilized to\nbalance the training set. The proposed model performs on public BraTs 2023,\nFigshare, and Kaggle datasets. Furthermore, we compare the proposed model with\nvarious deep learning models, including A-UNet, ResNet-9, pix2pix, pGAN for MRI\nsynthesis, and ConvNeXtTiny, ResNet101, DenseNet12, Residual CNN, ViT for\nclassification. According to the results, the proposed model pretraining on the\nMRI dataset is superior compared to the pretraining on the ImageNet dataset.\nOverall, the proposed model attains the highest accuracy, achieving 90.56% on\nthe BraTs dataset with T1 sequence, 98.53% on the Figshare, and 98.47% on the\nKaggle brain tumor datasets. As a result, the proposed model demonstrates a\nrobust, effective, and successful approach to handling insufficient dataset\nchallenges in MRI analysis by incorporating SSL, fine-tuning, data\naugmentation, and combining CNN and ViT.",

    "abstract": "In the last two years, text-to-image diffusion models have become extremely\npopular. As their quality and usage increase, a major concern has been the need\nfor better output control. In addition to prompt engineering, one effective\nmethod to improve the controllability of diffusion models has been to condition\nthem on additional modalities such as image style, depth map, or keypoints.\nThis forms the basis of ControlNets or Adapters. When attempting to apply these\nmethods to control human poses in outputs of text-to-image diffusion models,\ntwo main challenges have arisen. The first challenge is generating poses\nfollowing a wide range of semantic text descriptions, for which previous\nmethods involved searching for a pose within a dataset of (caption, pose)\npairs. The second challenge is conditioning image generation on a specified\npose while keeping both high aesthetic and high pose fidelity. In this article,\nwe fix these two main issues by introducing a text-to-pose (T2P) generative\nmodel alongside a new sampling algorithm, and a new pose adapter that\nincorporates more pose keypoints for higher pose fidelity. Together, these two\nnew state-of-the-art models enable, for the first time, a generative\ntext-to-pose-to-image framework for higher pose control in diffusion models.

In\nthis work, we address a fundamental question: what is the effective sample size\nfor modeling reciprocity? We examine this by analyzing the Bernoulli model with\nreciprocity, allowing for varying sparsity levels between non-reciprocal and\nreciprocal effects. We then extend this framework to a model that incorporates\nnode-specific heterogeneity and link-specific reciprocity using covariates. Our\nfindings reveal intriguing interplays between non-reciprocal and reciprocal\neffects in sparse networks.

Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a\nsignificant method for miniaturization, eliminating the need for bulky\nbatteries in devices. Despite successful demonstrations of millimetric battery\nfree implants in animal models, the robustness and efficiency of WPT are known\nto degrade significantly under misalignment incurred by body movements,\nrespiration, heart beating, and limited control of implant orientation during\nsurgery. This article presents an omnidirectional WPT platform for millimetric\nbioelectronic implants, employing the emerging magnetoelectric (ME) WPT\nmodality, and magnetic field steering technique based on multiple transmitter\n(TX) coils. To accurately sense the weak coupling in a miniature implant and\nadaptively control the multicoil TX array in a closed loop, we develop an\nactive echo (AE) scheme using a tiny coil on the implant. Our prototype\ncomprises a fully integrated 14.2 mm3 implantable stimulator embedding a custom\nlow power system on chip (SoC) powered by an ME film, a TX with a custom three\nchannel AE RX chip, and a multicoil TX array with mutual inductance\ncancellation. The AE RX achieves negative 161 dBm per Hz input referred noise\nwith 64 dB gain tuning range to reliably sense the AE signal, and offers fast\npolarity detection for driver control. AE simultaneously enhances the\nrobustness, efficiency, and charging range of ME WPT. Under 90 degree rotation\nfrom the ideal position, our omnidirectional WPT system achieves 6.8x higher\npower transfer efficiency (PTE) than a single coil baseline. The tracking error\nof AE negligibly degrades the PTE by less than 2 percent from using ideal\ncontrol.",

In this work, we propose a new adaptive\nframework, $\\textit{Adaptively Controllable Diffusion (AC-Diff) Model}$, to\nautomatically and fully control the generation process, including not only the\ntype of generation result but also the length and parameters of the generation\nprocess.

We further train the network with the\ncorresponding adaptive sampling mechanism to learn how to adjust itself\naccording to the conditions for the overall performance improvement.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of an organization that matches agents to objects where\nagents have preference rankings over objects and the organization uses\nalgorithms to construct a ranking over objects on behalf of each agent. Our new\nframework carries the interpretation that the organization and its agents may\nbe misaligned in pursuing some underlying matching goal. We design matching\nmechanisms that integrate agent decision-making and the algorithm by\nprioritizing matches that are unanimously agreeable between the two parties.\nOur mechanisms also satisfy restricted efficiency properties. Subsequently, we\nprove that no unanimous mechanism is strategy-proof but that ours can be\nnon-obviously manipulable. We generalize our framework to allow for any\npreference aggregation rules and extend the famed Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem\nto our setting. We apply our framework to place foster children in foster homes\nto maximize welfare. Using a machine learning model that predicts child welfare\nin placements and a novel \"elicited preferences\" experiment that extracts real\ncaseworkers' preferences, we empirically demonstrate that there are important\nmatch-specific welfare gains that our mechanisms extract that are not realized\nunder the status quo.",

Since this data is often scraped from the Internet without permission\nfrom the data owners, this raises concerns about copyright and intellectual\nproperty protections. While (illicit) use of data is easily detected for\ntraining samples perfectly re-created by a DM at inference time, it is much\nharder for data owners to verify if their data was used for training when the\noutputs from the suspect DM are not close replicas. Conceptually, membership\ninference attacks (MIAs), which detect if a given data point was used during\ntraining, present themselves as a suitable tool to address this challenge.\nHowever, we demonstrate that existing MIAs are not strong enough to reliably\ndetermine the membership of individual images in large, state-of-the-art DMs.\nTo overcome this limitation, we propose CDI, a framework for data owners to\nidentify whether their dataset was used to train a given DM. CDI relies on\ndataset inference techniques, i.e., instead of using the membership signal from\na single data point, CDI leverages the fact that most data owners, such as\nproviders of stock photography, visual media companies, or even individual\nartists, own datasets with multiple publicly exposed data points which might\nall be included in the training of a given DM. By selectively aggregating\nsignals from existing MIAs and using new handcrafted methods to extract\nfeatures for these datasets, feeding them to a scoring model, and applying\nrigorous statistical testing, CDI allows data owners with as little as 70 data\npoints to identify with a confidence of more than 99% whether their data was\nused to train a given DM. Thereby, CDI represents a valuable tool for data\nowners to claim illegitimate use of their copyrighted data.

We perform experiments in artificial seawater for a wide range\nof bubble size distributions, measuring both bulk and surface bubble\ndistributions (measured radii from 30 um to 5 mm), together with the associated\ndrop size distribution (salt aerosols and drops of measured radii from 50 nm to\n500 um) to quantify the link between emitted drops and bursting surface\nbubbles. We evaluate how well the individual bubble bursting scaling laws\ndescribe our data across all scales and demonstrate that the measured drop\nproduction by collective bubble bursting can be represented by a single\nframework integrating individual bubble bursting scaling laws over the various\nbubble sizes present in our experiments. We show that film drop production by\nbubbles between 100 um and 1 mm describes the submicron drop production, while\njet drop production by bubbles from 30 um to 2 mm describes the production of\ndrops larger than 1 um.

The\nmore detailed form of similarity among these proteins is sometimes overlooked\nby the conventional structural comparison methods. In contrast, further\nadvanced methods, such as Triangular Spatial Relationship (TSR), have been\ndemonstrated to make finer differentiations. Still, the classical\nimplementation of TSR does not provide for the integration of secondary\nstructure information, which is important for a more detailed understanding of\nthe folding pattern of a protein. To overcome these limitations, we developed\nthe SSE-TSR approach. The proposed method integrates secondary structure\nelements (SSEs) into TSR-based protein representations. This allows an enriched\nrepresentation of protein structures by considering 18 different combinations\nof helix, strand, and coil arrangements. Our results show that using SSEs\nimproves the accuracy and reliability of protein classification to varying\ndegrees. We worked with two large protein datasets of 9.2K and 7.8K samples,\nrespectively. We applied the SSE-TSR approach and used a neural network model\nfor classification. Interestingly, introducing SSEs improved performance\nstatistics for Dataset 1, with accuracy moving from 96.0% to 98.3%. For Dataset\n2, where the performance statistics were already good, further small\nimprovements were found with the introduction of SSE, giving an accuracy of\n99.5% compared to 99.4%. These results show that SSE integration can\ndramatically improve TSR key discrimination, with significant benefits in\ndatasets with low initial accuracies and only incremental gains in those with\nhigh baseline performance. Thus, SSE-TSR is a powerful bioinformatics tool that\nimproves protein classification and understanding of protein function and\ninteraction.",

    "abstract": "Emotion recognition has significant potential in healthcare and\naffect-sensitive systems such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However,\nchallenges such as the high cost of labeled data and variability in\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) signals across individuals limit the applicability\nof EEG-based emotion recognition models across domains. These challenges are\nexacerbated in cross-dataset scenarios due to differences in subject\ndemographics, recording devices, and presented stimuli. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel approach to improve cross-domain EEG-based emotion\nclassification. Our method, Gradual Proximity-guided Target Data Selection\n(GPTDS), incrementally selects reliable target domain samples for training. By\nevaluating their proximity to source clusters and the models confidence in\npredicting them, GPTDS minimizes negative transfer caused by noisy and diverse\nsamples. Additionally, we introduce Prediction Confidence-aware Test-Time\nAugmentation (PC-TTA), a cost-effective augmentation technique. Unlike\ntraditional TTA methods, which are computationally intensive, PC-TTA activates\nonly when model confidence is low, improving inference performance while\ndrastically reducing computational costs. Experiments on the DEAP and SEED\ndatasets validate the effectiveness of our approach. When trained on DEAP and\ntested on SEED, our model achieves 67.44% accuracy, a 7.09% improvement over\nthe baseline. Conversely, training on SEED and testing on DEAP yields 59.68%\naccuracy, a 6.07% improvement. Furthermore, PC-TTA reduces computational time\nby a factor of 15 compared to traditional TTA methods.

In the\nstandard thin disk model, jet power is limited by insufficient magnetic flux,\neven when the spin approaches maximum possible value.

According to this criterion,\nthe mDAE methodology was consistently ranked among the top methods (along with\nSoftImput and missForest), while the four more recent methods were\nsystematically ranked last. The Python code of the numerical study will be\navailable on GitHub so that results can be reproduced or generalized with other\ndatasets and methods.",

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence AI have shown promise\nin this area, but the technologys effectiveness across diverse skin tones\nremains a critical challenge. This study conducts a systematic review and\npreliminary analysis of AI based melanoma detection research published between\n2013 and 2024, focusing on deep learning methodologies, datasets, and skin tone\nrepresentation. Our findings indicate that while AI can enhance melanoma\ndetection, there is a significant bias towards lighter skin tones. To address\nthis, we propose including skin hue in addition to skin tone as represented by\nthe LOreal Color Chart Map for a more comprehensive skin tone assessment\ntechnique. This research highlights the need for diverse datasets and robust\nevaluation metrics to develop AI models that are equitable and effective for\nall patients.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new approach for estimating core inflation indicators\nbased on common factors across a broad range of price indices. Specifically, by\nutilizing procedures for detecting multiple regimes in high-dimensional factor\nmodels, we propose two types of core inflation indicators: one incorporating\nmultiple structural breaks and another based on Markov switching. The\nstructural breaks approach can eliminate revisions for past regimes, though it\nfunctions as an offline indicator, as real-time detection of breaks is not\nfeasible with this method. On the other hand, the Markov switching approach can\nreduce revisions while being useful in real time, making it a simple and robust\ncore inflation indicator suitable for real-time monitoring and as a short-term\nguide for monetary policy. Additionally, this approach allows us to estimate\nthe probability of being in different inflationary regimes. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of these indicators, we apply them to Canadian price data. To\ncompare the real-time performance of the Markov switching approach to the\nbenchmark model without regime-switching, we assess their abilities to forecast\nheadline inflation and minimize revisions. We find that the Markov switching\nmodel delivers superior predictive accuracy and significantly reduces revisions\nduring periods of substantial inflation changes. Hence, our findings suggest\nthat accounting for time-varying factors and parameters enhances inflation\nsignal accuracy and reduces data requirements, especially following sudden\neconomic shifts.",

    "abstract": "Learning a reward model (RM) from human preferences has been an important\ncomponent in aligning large language models (LLMs). The canonical setup of\nlearning RMs from pairwise preference data is rooted in the classic\nBradley-Terry (BT) model that accepts binary feedback, i.e., the label being\neither Response 1 is better than Response 2, or the opposite. Such a setup\ninevitably discards potentially useful samples (such as \"tied\" between the two\nresponses) and loses more fine-grained information (such as \"slightly better\").\nIn this paper, we propose a framework for learning RMs under ordinal feedback\nwhich generalizes the case of binary preference feedback to any arbitrary\ngranularity. Specifically, we first identify a marginal unbiasedness condition,\nwhich generalizes the assumption of the BT model in the existing binary\nfeedback setting. The condition validates itself via the sociological concept\nof the wisdom of the crowd. Under the condition, we develop a natural\nprobability model for pairwise preference data under ordinal feedback and\nanalyze its properties. We prove the statistical benefits of ordinal feedback\nin terms of reducing the Rademacher complexity compared to the case of binary\nfeedback. The proposed learning objective and the theory also extend to hinge\nloss and direct policy optimization (DPO). In particular, the theoretical\nanalysis may be of independent interest when applying to a seemingly unrelated\nproblem of knowledge distillation to interpret the bias-variance trade-off\ntherein. The framework also sheds light on writing guidance for human\nannotators. Our numerical experiments validate that fine-grained feedback leads\nto better reward learning for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution\nsettings. Further experiments show that incorporating a certain proportion of\nsamples with tied preference boosts RM learning.",

Despite recent\nprogress, existing dataset distillation methods often struggle with\ncomputational efficiency, scalability to complex high-resolution datasets, and\ngeneralizability to deep architectures. These approaches typically require\nretraining when the distillation ratio changes, as knowledge is embedded in raw\npixels. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Data-to-Model\nDistillation (D2M) to distill the real dataset's knowledge into the learnable\nparameters of a pre-trained generative model by aligning rich representations\nextracted from real and generated images. The learned generative model can then\nproduce informative training images for different distillation ratios and deep\narchitectures. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets of varying resolutions show\nD2M's superior performance, re-distillation efficiency, and cross-architecture\ngeneralizability. Our method effectively scales up to high-resolution 128x128\nImageNet-1K. Furthermore, we verify D2M's practical benefits for downstream\napplications in neural architecture search.",

The cooling radiation can be observed in forbidden lines at\noptical wavelengths. We aim to determine whether supernovae at different\npositions within a molecular cloud can be distinguished based on their optical\nemission, using machine learning. We have conducted a statistical analysis of\nthe optical line emission of simulated supernovae interacting with molecular\nclouds that formed from the multi-phase interstellar medium modelled in the\nSILCC-Zoom simulations with and without magnetic fields. This work is based on\nthe post-processing of 3-D (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations. Our data set\nconsists of 22 simulations. The supernovae are placed at a distance of either\n25 pc or 50 pc from the molecular cloud centre of mass. First, we calculate\noptical synthetic emission maps (taking into account dust attenuation within\nthe simulation sub-cube). Second, we analyse the data set of synthetic\nobservations using principle component analysis to identify clusters with the\nk-means algorithm. We find that the presence or absence of magnetic fields has\nno statistically significant effect on the optical line emission. However, the\nambient density distribution at the site of the supernova changes the entire\nevolution and morphology of the supernova remnant. Due to the different ambient\ndensities in the 25 pc and 50 pc simulations, we are able to distinguish them\nin a statistically significant manner. Although, optical line attenuation\nwithin the supernova remnant can mimic this result depending on the attenuation\nmodel that is used.

B/W X-ray images require a careful balance\nbetween noise suppression and high-detail preservation to ensure clarity in\nsoft-tissue structures and bone edges. While traditional methods, such as CNNs\nand early super-resolution models like ESRGAN, have enhanced image resolution,\nthey often perform poorly regarding high-frequency detail preservation and\nnoise control for B/W imaging. We are going to present one efficient approach\nthat improves the quality of an image with the optimization of network\ntransmission in the following paper. The pre-processing of X-ray images into\nlow-resolution files by Real-ESRGAN, a version of ESRGAN elucidated and\nimproved, helps reduce the server load and transmission bandwidth.\nLower-resolution images are upscaled at the receiving end using Real-ESRGAN,\nfine-tuned for real-world image degradation. The model integrates\nResidual-in-Residual Dense Blocks with perceptual and adversarial loss\nfunctions for high-quality upscaled images with low noise. We further fine-tune\nReal-ESRGAN by adapting it to the specific B/W noise and contrast\ncharacteristics. This suppresses noise artifacts without compromising detail.\nThe comparative evaluation conducted shows that our approach achieves superior\nnoise reduction and detail clarity compared to state-of-the-art CNN-based and\nESRGAN models, apart from reducing network bandwidth requirements. These\nbenefits are confirmed both by quantitative metrics, including Peak\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity Index, and by qualitative\nassessments, which indicate the potential of Real-ESRGAN for diagnostic-quality\nX-ray imaging and for efficient medical data transmission.",

Using this definition, several frustrated models have been\ncreated and studied, among them we can mention the Villain's model, the fully\nfrustrated simple cubic lattice, the antiferromagnetic triangular lattice. The\nformer models are systems with mixed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds,\nwhile in the latter containing only an antiferromagnetic interaction, the\nfrustration is caused by the lattice geometry. These frustrated spin systems\nhave novel properties that we will review in this paper. One of the striking\naspects is the fact that well-established methods such as the renormalization\ngroup fail to deal with the nature of the phase transition in frustrated\nsystems. Investigations of properties of frustrated spin systems have been\nintensive since the 80's. I myself got involved in several investigations of\nfrustrated spin systems soon after my PhD. I have learned a lot from numerous\ndiscussions with G\\'erard Toulouse. Until today, I am still working on\nfrustrated systems such as skyrmions. In this review, I trace back a number of\nmy works over the years on frustrated spin systems going from exactly solved 2D\nIsing frustrated models, to XY and Heisenberg 2D and 3D frustrated lattices. At\nthe end I present my latest results on skyrmions resulting from the frustration\ncaused by the competition between the exchange interaction and the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction under an applied magnetic field.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) has been a popular and effective method for model\ncompression. One important assumption of KD is that the teacher's original\ndataset will also be available when training the student. However, in\nsituations such as continual learning and distilling large models trained on\ncompany-withheld datasets, having access to the original data may not always be\npossible. This leads practitioners towards utilizing other sources of\nsupplemental data, which could yield mixed results. One must then ask: \"what\nmakes a good dataset for transferring knowledge from teacher to student?\" Many\nwould assume that only real in-domain imagery is viable, but is that the only\noption? In this work, we explore multiple possible surrogate distillation\ndatasets and demonstrate that many different datasets, even unnatural synthetic\nimagery, can serve as a suitable alternative in KD. From examining these\nalternative datasets, we identify and present various criteria describing what\nmakes a good dataset for distillation. Source code will be available in the\nfuture.",

    "abstract": "Quantum error correction (QEC) is crucial for ensuring the reliability of\nquantum computers. However, implementing QEC often requires a significant\nnumber of qubits, leading to substantial overhead. One of the major challenges\nin quantum computing is reducing this overhead, especially since QEC codes\ndepend heavily on ancilla qubits for stabilizer measurements. In this work, we\npropose reducing the number of ancilla qubits by reusing the same ancilla\nqubits for both X- and Z-type stabilizers. This is achieved by alternating\nbetween X and Z stabilizer measurements during each half-round, cutting the\nnumber of required ancilla qubits in half. This technique can be applied\nbroadly across various QEC codes, we focus on rotated surface codes only and\nachieve nearly \\(25\\%\\) reduction in total qubit overhead. We also present a\nfew use cases where the proposed idea enables the usage of higher-distance\nsurface codes at a relatively lesser qubit count. Our analysis shows that the\nmodified approach enables users to achieve similar or better error correction\nwith fewer qubits, especially for higher distances (\\(d \\geq 13\\)).\nAdditionally, we identify conditions where the modified code allows for\nextended distances (\\(d + k\\)) while using the same or fewer resources as the\noriginal, offering a scalable and practical solution for quantum error\ncorrection.

    "abstract": "People with diabetes need insulin delivery to effectively manage their blood\nglucose levels, especially after meals, because their bodies either do not\nproduce enough insulin or cannot fully utilize it. Accurate insulin delivery\nstarts with estimating the nutrients in meals and is followed by developing a\ndetailed, personalized insulin injection strategy. These tasks are particularly\nchallenging in daily life, especially without professional guidance. Existing\nsolutions usually assume the prior knowledge of nutrients in meals and\nprimarily rely on feedback from professional clinicians or simulators to\ndevelop Reinforcement Learning-based models for insulin management, leading to\nextensive consumption of medical resources and difficulties in adapting the\nmodels to new patients due to individual differences. In this paper, we propose\nDIETS, a novel diabetic insulin management framework built on the transformer\narchitecture, to help people with diabetes effectively manage insulin delivery\nin everyday life. Specifically, DIETS tailors a Large Language Model (LLM) to\nestimate the nutrients in meals and employs a titration model to generate\nrecommended insulin injection strategies, which are further validated by a\nglucose prediction model to prevent potential risks of hyperglycemia or\nhypoglycemia. DIETS has been extensively evaluated on three public datasets,\nand the results show it achieves superior performance in providing effective\ninsulin delivery recommendation to control blood glucose levels.",

We aim to reach a resolution that directly\ncaptures the shock-cloud interactions for the majority of the clouds\ninitialized by the saturation of thermal instability. In comparison to the SNR\nin a uniform medium with the volume filling warm medium, the SNR expands\nsimilarly (following $\\propto t^{2/5}$) but sweeps up more mass as the cold\nclouds contribute before shocks in the warm medium become radiative. However,\nthe SNR in a cloudy medium continuously loses energy after shocks toward the\ncold clouds cool, resulting in less hot gas mass, thermal energy, and terminal\nmomentum. Thermal conduction has little effect on the dynamics of the SNR but\nsmooths the morphology and modifies the internal structure by increasing the\ndensity of hot gas by a factor of $\\sim 3-5$. The simulation results are not\nfully consistent with many previous 1D models describing the SNR in a cloudy\nmedium including a mass loading term.

As each copy of the commuting SYK\nmodel does not commute with others, this construction breaks the integrability\nof each commuting SYK and the family of models demonstrates the emergence of\nquantum chaos. We study the spectrum of this model analytically in the\ndouble-scaled limit. As the number of copies tends to infinity, the spectrum\nbecomes compact and equivalent to the regular SYK model. For finite $d$ copies,\nthe spectrum is close to the regular SYK model in UV but has an exponential\ntail $e^{E/T_c}$ in the IR. We identify the reciprocal of the exponent in the\ntail as a critical temperature $T_c$, above which the model should be quantum\nchaotic. $T_c$ monotonically decreases as $d$ increases, which expands the\nchaotic regime over the non-chaotic regime. We propose the existence of a new\nphase around $T_c$, and the dynamics should be very different in two phases. We\nfurther carry out numeric analysis at finite $d$, which supports our proposal.\n  Given any finite dimensional local Hamiltonian, by decomposing it into $d$\ngroups, in which all terms in one group commute with each other but terms from\ndifferent groups may not, our analysis can give an estimate of the critical\ntemperature for quantum chaos based on the decomposition.

    "abstract": "We present a detailed analysis of jet activity in the radio galaxy 3C348 at\nthe center of the galaxy cluster Hercules A. We use archival Chandra data to\ninvestigate the jet-driven shock front, the radio-faint X-ray cavities, the\neastern jet, and the presence of extended Inverse Compton (IC) X-ray emission\nfrom the radio lobes. We detect two pairs of shocks: one in the north-south\ndirection at 150 kpc from the center, and another in the east-west direction at\n280 kpc. These shocks have Mach numbers of $\\mathcal{M} = 1.65\\pm0.05$ and\n$\\mathcal{M} = 1.9\\pm0.3$, respectively. Together, they form a complete cocoon\naround the large radio lobes. Based on the distance of the shocks from the\ncenter, we estimate that the corresponding jet outburst is 90-150 Myr old. We\nconfirm the presence of two radio-faint cavities within the cocoon, misaligned\nfrom the lobes, each $\\sim$100 kpc wide and 40-60 Myr old. A backflow from the\nradio lobes might explain why the cavities are dynamically younger than the\ncocoon shock front. We also detect non-thermal X-ray emission from the eastern\njet and from the large radio lobes. The X-ray emission from the jet is visible\nat 80 kpc from the AGN and can be accounted for by an IC model with a mild\nDoppler boosting ($\\delta\\sim2.7$). A synchrotron model could explain the\nradio-to-X-ray spectrum only for very high Lorentz factors $\\gamma\\geq10^{8}$\nof the electrons in the jet. For the large radio lobes, we argue that the X-ray\nemission has an IC origin, with a 1 keV flux density of\n$21.7\\pm1.4\\text{(statistical)}\\pm1.3\\text{(systematic)}$ nJy. A thermal model\nis unlikely, as it would require unrealistically high gas temperature, density,\nand pressure, along with a strong depolarization of the radio lobes, which are\ninstead highly polarized. The IC detection, combined with the synchrotron flux\ndensity, suggests a magnetic field of $12\\pm3\\mu$G in the lobes.",

For this, we exploit the information contained within the\nin-plane motions of disk stars from Gaia DR3 to adjust a model of the Galactic\npotential, including a detailed parametric form for the bar and spiral arms. We\nexplore the parameter space of the non-axisymmetric components with the\nbackward integration method, first adjusting the bar model to selected peaks of\nthe stellar velocity distribution in the Solar neighbourhood, and then\nadjusting the amplitude, phase, pitch angle and pattern speed of spiral arms to\nthe median radial velocity as a function of position within the disk. We check\na posteriori that our solution also qualitatively reproduces various other\nfeatures of the global non-axisymmetric phase-space distribution, including\nmost of the moving groups and phase-space ridges despite those not being\nprimarily used in the adjustment. This fiducial model has a bar with pattern\nspeed $37~{\\rm kms}^{-1}{\\rm kpc}^{-1}$ and two spiral modes that are two-armed\nand three-armed respectively. The two-armed spiral mode has a $\\sim 25~\\%$\nlocal contrast surface density, a low pattern speed of $13.1~{\\rm kms}^{-1}{\\rm\nkpc}^{-1}$, and matches the location of the Crux-Scutum, Local and Outer arm\nsegments. The three-armed spiral mode has a $\\sim 9~\\%$ local contrast density,\na slightly higher pattern speed of $16.4~{\\rm kms}^{-1}{\\rm kpc}^{-1}$, and\nmatches the location of the Carina-Sagittarius and Perseus arm segments. The\nGalactic bar, with a higher pattern speed than both spiral modes, has recently\ndisconnected from those two arms. The fiducial non-axisymmetric potential\npresented in this paper, reproducing most non-axisymmetric signatures detected\nin the stellar kinematics of the Milky Way disk, can henceforth be used to\nconfidently integrate orbits within the Galactic plane.",

In this work, we improve HI-based\ndust templates in the north/south Galactic poles covering a sky fraction of\n$f_{\\rm sky}=13.5\\%/11.0\\%$ (5577/4555\\,deg$^2$) by incorporating data from\nionized (HII) and molecular (H$_2$) gas phases. We make further improvements by\nemploying a clustering analysis on the HI spectral data to identify discrete\nclouds with distinct dust properties. However, only a modest reduction in\nfitting residuals is achieved. We quantify the contributions to these residuals\nfrom variations in the dust-to-gas ratio, dust temperature and opacity, and\nmagnetic field orientation using ancillary datasets. Although residuals in a\nfew particular regions can be attributed to these factors, no single\nexplanation accounts for the majority. Assuming a constant dust temperature\nalong each line of sight, we derive an upper limit on the high-latitude dust\ntemperature variation of $\\sigma_T<1.28$K, lower than the temperature variation\nreported in previous studies. Joint analysis of multiple existing and upcoming\ndatasets that trace Galactic gas and dust properties is needed to clarify the\norigins of the variation of gas and dust properties found here and to\nsignificantly improve gas-based extinction maps.",

We note that the\nNBO appeared only in the 0.5-3 keV energy range, with maximum strength in the\n1-2 keV energy band, but was absent in the 3-10 keV energy band of NuSTAR and\nNICER data. The energy spectrum of the source exhibits an emission feature at ~\n1 keV, previously identified as the Fe L transition in the outer region of the\naccretion disk. Upon considering both the Fe L and NBO features, we suggest\nthat the originating location of the Fe L line and the NBOs may coincide and\nperhaps be due to the same underlying mechanism. Therefore, lags seen in the\nfrequency/energy dependent lag spectra of Cygnus X-2 could be considered to be\narising from a region of photoionized material far from the central source. We\nstudy the frequency and energy dependent lag spectra of the source, which\nexhibited a few milliseconds hard lag at the NBO frequency (12-15 ms) and a\nswitch from hard to soft lags at 1 keV. The rms spectrum peaks at 1 keV and the\ncovariance spectrum clearly resembles a thermal spectrum.

Here, we go beyond this paradigm by\nstudying quantum critical systems with boundary perturbations that decay\nalgebraically (following a power law) into the bulk. By continuously varying\nthe decay exponent, such perturbations can transition between having no effect\non the bulk and strongly influencing bulk behavior. We investigate this regime\nusing two prototypical models based on (1+1)D massless Dirac fermions.

Thanks to the all-sky survey carried out by TESS, many of\nthese exoplanets have been discovered and have subsequently been characterized\nwith dedicated follow-up observations. In the context of a collaboration among\nthe GAPS, TKS and CPS teams, we measured with a high level of precision the\nmass and the radius of TOI-1430 b, a young (~700 Myr) exoplanet with an\nescaping He atmosphere orbiting the K-dwarf star HD 235088 (TOI-1430). By\nadopting appropriate stellar parameters, which were measured in this work, we\nwere able to simultaneously model the signals due to strong stellar activity\nand the transiting planet TOI-1430 b in both photometric and spectroscopic\nseries. This allowed us to measure the density of the planet with high\nprecision, and reconstruct the evolution of its atmosphere. TOI-1430 is an\nactive K-dwarf star born 700+/-150 Myr ago and rotates in ~12 d. It hosts a\nmini-Neptune whose orbital period is Pb=7.434133+/-0.000004 d. Thanks to\nlong-term monitoring of this target performed with TESS, HARPS-N, HIRES, and\nAPF, we estimated a radius Rb=1.98+/-0.07 $R_{\\oplus}$, a mass Mb=4.2+/-0.8\n$M_{\\oplus}$, and thus a planetary density $\\rho$b=0.5+/-0.1 $\\rho_{\\oplus}$.\nTOI-1430 b is hence a low-density mini-Neptune with an extended atmosphere, at\nthe edge of the radius gap. Because this planet is known to have an evaporating\natmosphere of He, we reconstructed its atmospheric history. Our analysis\nsupports the scenario in which, shortly after its birth, TOI-1430 b may have\nbeen super-puffy, with a radius 5x-13x and a mass 1.5x-2x that of today; in\n~200 Myr from now, TOI-1430 b should lose its envelope, showing its Earth-size\ncore.",

The Big MAC is the first\narchive to assemble all multi-AGN systems and candidates across all selection\nmethods, redshifts, and galaxy mass ratios, and this catalog offers a solid\nfoundation for archival and targeted multiwavelength follow-up investigations.\nIn this work, we provide an overview of the creation of the multi-AGN\nliterature library and the catalog itself, present definitions for different\nmulti-AGN classes (including new definitions for dual AGNs derived from galaxy\npairs in Illustris-TNG100), describe the general properties of the catalog as a\nfunction of redshift space and separation, and we provide a thorough\nexamination of selection and confirmation method usage within the literature.\nWe also discuss best practices for the multi-AGN literature, and we emphasize\nthat a diverse, multiwavelength array of selection approaches is crucial for a\ncomplete understanding of multi-AGNs and - by extension - answering\nlong-standing, open questions regarding the importance of AGNs and galaxy\nmergers.",

Since it is\ncurrently not possible to infer stellar ages directly for individual RRL stars,\nour goal in this work is to search for these in association to intermediate-age\nclusters whose reliable ages can then be safely be attributed to the RRL. We\nused the Gaia DR3 Specific Object Study and OGLE IV public catalogues to search\nfor RRL stars around stellar clusters older than 1~Gyr in the Large and Small\nMagellanic Clouds. Modelling membership probabilities based on proper motion\nand photometric distance we obtained a list of 259 RRL stars associated with\nMagellanic clusters. Of these, 23 RRL are likely members of 10 intermediate-age\nclusters: 3 and 7 in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, respectively. By\nmodelling the inferred expectation values of the number of RRL stars per\ncluster, we inferred the delay time distribution of the RRL in three age\nranges. For the old population ($>8$~Gyr) we find $2.5^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ RRL$/10^5\nM_\\odot$. For the young (1-2 Gyr) and intermediate age (2-8 Gyr) populations we\nfind rates of $0.34^{+0.17}_{-0.12}$ and $0.071^{+0.073}_{-0.041}$ RRL$/10^5\nM_\\odot$, respectively, after further decontamination from control field tests.\nWhile radial velocities are necessary for definitively confirming cluster\nmemberships, the high-probability list of intermediate-age RRL stars presented\nhere offers a promising opportunity for the first direct confirmation of these\nenigmatic stars.",

Several existing SZZ\nalgorithms provide a way to identify the potential commit that induced a bug\nwhen given a fixing commit as input. Prior work introduced the notion of a\n\"work item\", a logical grouping of commits that could be a single unit of work.\nOur key insight in this work is to recognize that a bug-inducing commit and the\nfix(es) for that bug together represent a \"work item.\" It is not currently\nunderstood how these work items, which are logical groups of revisions\naddressing a single issue or feature, could impact the performance of\nalgorithms such as SZZ. In this paper, we propose a heuristic that, given an\ninput commit, uses information about changed methods to identify related\ncommits that form a work item with the input commit. We hypothesize that given\nsuch a work item identifying heuristic, we can identify bug-inducing commits\nmore accurately than existing SZZ approaches. We then build a new variant of\nSZZ that we call Work Item Aware SZZ (WIA-SZZ), that leverages our work item\ndetecting heuristic to first suggest bug-inducing commits. If our heuristic\nfails to find any candidates, we then fall back to baseline variants of SZZ. We\nconduct a manual evaluation to assess the accuracy of our heuristic to identify\nwork items. Our evaluation reveals the heuristic is 64% accurate in finding\nwork items, but most importantly it is able to find many bug-inducing commits.\nWe then evaluate our approach on 821 repositories that have been previously\nused to study the performance of SZZ, comparing our work against six SZZ\nvariants. That evaluation shows an improvement in F1 scores ranging from 2% to\n9%, or when looking only at the subset of cases that found work item improved\n3% to 14%.",

The initial condition,\nbeing a non-perturbative object, usually has to be modeled separately.\nTypically, the model contains several tunable parameters that are determined by\nfitting to experimental data. In this contribution, we propose an\nimplementation of the BK solver using differentiable programming. Automatic\ndifferentiation offers the possibility that the first and second derivatives of\nthe amplitude with respect to the initial condition parameters are\nautomatically calculated at all stages of the simulation. This fact should\nconsiderably facilitate and speed up the fitting step. Moreover, in the context\nof Transverse Momentum Dis- tributions (TMD), we demonstrate that automatic\ndifferentiation can be used to obtain the first and second derivatives of the\namplitude with respect to the quark-antiquark separation. These derivatives can\nbe used to relate various TMD functions to the dipole amplitude. Our C++ code\nfor the solver, which is available in a public repository [1], includes the\nBalitsky one-loop running coupling prescription and the kinematic constraint.\nThis version of the BK equation is widely used in the small-x evolution\nframework.",

During the online phase, when given observational\ndata, we seek rapid posterior approximation using surrogate-driven training of\na lazy map [Brennan et al., NeurIPS, (2020)], i.e., a structure-exploiting\ntransport map with low-dimensional nonlinearity. The trained lazy map then\nproduces approximate posterior samples or density evaluations. Our surrogate\nconstruction is optimized for amortized Bayesian inversion using lazy map\nvariational inference. We show that (i) the derivative-based reduced basis\narchitecture [O'Leary-Roseberry et al., Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng., 388\n(2022)] minimizes the upper bound on the expected error in surrogate posterior\napproximation, and (ii) the derivative-informed training formulation\n[O'Leary-Roseberry et al., J. Comput. Phys., 496 (2024)] minimizes the expected\nerror due to surrogate-driven transport map optimization. Our numerical results\ndemonstrate that LazyDINO is highly efficient in cost amortization for Bayesian\ninversion. We observe one to two orders of magnitude reduction of offline cost\nfor accurate posterior approximation, compared to simulation-based amortized\ninference via conditional transport and conventional surrogate-driven\ntransport. In particular, LazyDINO outperforms Laplace approximation\nconsistently using fewer than 1000 offline samples, while other amortized\ninference methods struggle and sometimes fail at 16,000 offline samples.",

For example, MOS tests fail to\ndifferentiate between similar models, and CMOS's pairwise comparisons are\ntime-intensive. The MUSHRA test is a promising alternative for evaluating\nmultiple TTS systems simultaneously, but in this work we show that its reliance\non matching human reference speech unduly penalises the scores of modern TTS\nsystems that can exceed human speech quality. More specifically, we conduct a\ncomprehensive assessment of the MUSHRA test, focusing on its sensitivity to\nfactors such as rater variability, listener fatigue, and reference bias. Based\non our extensive evaluation involving 492 human listeners across Hindi and\nTamil we identify two primary shortcomings: (i) reference-matching bias, where\nraters are unduly influenced by the human reference, and (ii) judgement\nambiguity, arising from a lack of clear fine-grained guidelines. To address\nthese issues, we propose two refined variants of the MUSHRA test. The first\nvariant enables fairer ratings for synthesized samples that surpass human\nreference quality. The second variant reduces ambiguity, as indicated by the\nrelatively lower variance across raters. By combining these approaches, we\nachieve both more reliable and more fine-grained assessments. We also release\nMANGO, a massive dataset of 246,000 human ratings, the first-of-its-kind\ncollection for Indian languages, aiding in analyzing human preferences and\ndeveloping automatic metrics for evaluating TTS systems.",

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) systems have demonstrated impressive\nvision-language reasoning capabilities but suffer from pervasive and severe\nhallucination issues, posing significant risks in critical domains such as\nhealthcare and autonomous systems. Despite previous efforts to mitigate\nhallucinations, a persistent issue remains: visual defect from vision-language\nmisalignment, creating a bottleneck in visual processing capacity. To address\nthis challenge, we develop Complementary Adaptive Token-level Contrastive\nDecoding to Mitigate Hallucinations in LVLMs (CATCH), based on the Information\nBottleneck theory. CATCH introduces Complementary Visual Decoupling (CVD) for\nvisual information separation, Non-Visual Screening (NVS) for hallucination\ndetection, and Adaptive Token-level Contrastive Decoding (ATCD) for\nhallucination mitigation. CATCH addresses issues related to visual defects that\ncause diminished fine-grained feature perception and cumulative hallucinations\nin open-ended scenarios. It is applicable to various visual question-answering\ntasks without requiring any specific data or prior knowledge, and generalizes\nrobustly to new tasks without additional training, opening new possibilities\nfor advancing LVLM in various challenging applications.",

While physics\nsimulations are one of the predominant methods for data collection and robot\ntraining, simulating soft materials presents considerable challenges.\nSpecifically, it is significantly more costly than simulating rigid objects in\nterms of simulation speed and storage requirements. These limitations typically\nrestrict the scope of studies on soft materials to small and bounded areas,\nthereby hindering the learning of skills in broader spaces. To address this\nissue, we introduce UBSoft, a new simulation platform designed to support\nunbounded soft environments for robot skill acquisition. Our platform utilizes\nspatially adaptive resolution scales, where simulation resolution dynamically\nadjusts based on proximity to active robotic agents. Our framework markedly\nreduces the demand for extensive storage space and computation costs required\nfor large-scale scenarios involving soft materials. We also establish a set of\nbenchmark tasks in our platform, including both locomotion and manipulation\ntasks, and conduct experiments to evaluate the efficacy of various\nreinforcement learning algorithms and trajectory optimization techniques, both\ngradient-based and sampling-based. Preliminary results indicate that\nsampling-based trajectory optimization generally achieves better results for\nobtaining one trajectory to solve the task. Additionally, we conduct\nexperiments in real-world environments to demonstrate that advancements made in\nour UBSoft simulator could translate to improved robot interactions with\nlarge-scale soft material.

A powerful tool for improving\ncurrent knowledge and capabilities consists of multi-spacecraft observations of\nthe same event, which take place when two or more spacecraft fortuitously find\nthemselves in the path of a single CME. Multi-probe events can not only supply\nuseful data to evaluate the large-scale of CMEs from 1D in-situ trajectories,\nbut also provide additional constraints and validation opportunities for CME\npropagation models. In this work, we analyse and simulate the coronal and\nheliospheric evolution of a slow, streamer-blowout CME that erupted on 23\nSeptember 2021 and was encountered in situ by four spacecraft approximately\nequally distributed in heliocentric distance between 0.4 and 1 au. We employ\nthe Open Solar Physics Rapid Ensemble Information (OSPREI) modelling suite in\nensemble mode to predict the CME arrival and structure in a hindcast fashion\nand to compute the \"best-fit\" solutions at the different spacecraft\nindividually and together. We find that the spread in the predicted quantities\nincreases with heliocentric distance, suggesting that there may be a maximum\n(angular and radial) separation between an inner and an outer probe beyond\nwhich estimates of the in-situ magnetic field orientation (parameterised by\nflux rope model geometry) increasingly diverge.

If the OH\novertone stretching mode is excited in methanol to either the 5th or 6th\novertone, the bimolecular reaction between methanol and O$_2$ becomes\nthermodynamically feasible and could contribute to formation of methoxy and\nHO$_2$ radicals under the proper combination of pressure and temperature.",

We introduce the definition of the local out-degree $g^*(v)$ of a vertex\n$v$, and show it to be equal to the local density $\\rho^*(v)$. We consider the\nlocal out-degree to be conceptually simpler, shorter to define, and easier to\ncompute.\n  Using the local out-degree we show a previously unknown fact: that existing\nalgorithms already dynamically approximate the local density.

    "abstract": "As data transmission demands grow, long-haul optical transmission links face\nincreasing pressure to increase their throughput. Expanding usable bandwidth\nthrough Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) systems has become the primary strategy for\nincreasing transmission capacity. However, UWB systems present challenges, such\nas the reliance on backward Raman amplification and the complications posed by\ninter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS), which causes uneven signal\npropagation across bands. To address these issues, accurate and efficient\nphysical models are required for real-time optimization, which rely on the\nknowledge of the power profile. This paper develops a novel, more efficient\nmethod for computing the power profile of signals and pumps, utilizing the\nintegral form of the equations with matrix-based approximations. The algorithm\nachieves up to a thirty-fold average speed increase over conventional\napproaches while maintaining an error margin under 0.05 dBm. These results\nrepresent a significant step forward towards reducing optimization times and\nenabling more extensive studies in ultra-wide band long haul optical\ntransmission, further facilitating research and commercialization of UWB\nsystems, in an effort to address the growing demand for higher throughput.",

The core of the system is a sophisticated pipeline that begins\nwith reclassification and recognition of ASL gestures based on a strong Random\nForest Classifier. By recognizing the ASL, it is translated into text which can\nbe more easily processed. Highly evolved natural language NLP (Natural Language\nProcessing) techniques come in handy as they play a role in our LLM integration\nwhere you then use LLMs to be able to convert the ASL text to ISL which\nprovides you with the intent of sentence or phrase. The final step is to\nsynthesize the translated text back into ISL gestures, creating an end-to-end\ntranslation experience using RIFE-Net. This framework is tasked with key\nchallenges such as automatically dealing with gesture variability and\novercoming the linguistic differences between ASL and ISL. By automating the\ntranslation process, we hope to vastly improve accessibility for sign language\nusers.

Based on this idea, the\nClifford circuits augmented matrix product states (CAMPS) method, which is a\nseamless integration of Clifford circuits within the density-matrix\nrenormalization group algorithm, was proposed recently and was shown to be able\nto reduce entanglement in various quantum systems. In this work, we further\nexplore the power of the CAMPS method in critical spin chains described by\nconformal field theories (CFTs) in the scaling limit.

For the\ncritical quantum Ising spin chain governed by the Ising CFT with self-duality,\nthe Clifford circuits found by CAMPS coincide with the duality transformation,\ni.e., the Kramers-Wannier self-duality in the critical Ising chain. It reduces\nthe entanglement entropy by mapping the free conformal boundary condition to\nthe fixed one. In the more general case of the XXZ chain, the CAMPS gives rise\nto a duality transformation mapping the model to the quantum Ashkin-Teller spin\nchain.

    "abstract": "Resistive random access memory (ReRAM) is a promising emerging non-volatile\nmemory (NVM) technology that shows high potential for both data storage and\ncomputing. However, its crossbar array architecture leads to the sneak path\nproblem, which may severely degrade the reliability of data stored in the ReRAM\ncell. Due to the complication of memory physics and unique features of the\nsneak path induced interference (SPI), it is difficult to derive an accurate\nchannel model for it. The deep learning (DL)-based detection scheme\n\\cite{zhong2020sneakdl} can better mitigate the SPI, at the cost of additional\npower consumption and read latency. In this letter, we first propose a novel CC\nscheme which can not only reduce the SPI in the memory array, but also\neffectively differentiate the memory arrays into two categories of\nsneak-path-free and sneak-path-affected arrays. For the sneak-path-free arrays,\nwe can use a simple middle-point threshold detector to detect the low and high\nresistance cells of ReRAM. For the sneak-path-affected arrays, a DL detector is\nfirst trained off-line (prior to the data detection of ReRAM). To avoid the\nadditional power consumption and latency introduced by the DL detector, we\nfurther propose a DL-based threshold detector, whose detection threshold can be\nderived based on the outputs of the DL detector. It is then utilized for the\nonline data detection of all the identified sneak-path-affected arrays.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the above CC and DL aided threshold\ndetection scheme can effectively mitigate the SPI of the ReRAM array and\nachieve better error rate performance than the prior art detection schemes,\nwithout the prior knowledge of the channel.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of a monolithic fiber-optically coupled CMOS-based\nTemCam-XF416 camera into our ultra-high vacuum (UHV) ultrafast reflection\nhigh-energy electron diffraction setup is reported. A combination of a pumpable\ngate valve and a self-built cooling collar allows UHV conditions to be reached\nwithout the need to remove the heat-sensitive device. The water-cooled collar\nis mounted to the camera housing and prevents heating of the detector upon\nbake-out of the UHV chamber. The TemCam provides an one order of magnitude\nhigher spatial resolution than the previously used microchannel plate (MCP)\nbased detector (Burle Chevron 3040FM) which enables a 30% higher resolution in\nreciprocal space. The low background intensity and the 4$\\times$ lager dynamic\nrange enables analysis of the diffuse intensity of the diffraction pattern like\nKikuchi lines and bands. A key advantage over the previous MCP detector is the\ncomplete absence of the blooming effect, which enables the quantitative spot\nprofile analysis of the diffraction spots. The inherent light sensitivity in an\noptical pump experiment can be overcome by using photons with h{\\nu} < 1.12 eV,\ni.e., the indirect band gap of silicon, or by shielding any stray light.",

It consists of two crucial steps:\ninitially predicting unknown parameters of an optimization model and\nsubsequently solving the problem based on these predictions. Elmachtoub and\nGrigas [1] introduced the Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) loss for the\nframework, which gauges the decision error arising from predicted parameters,\nand a convex surrogate, the SPO+ loss, which incorporates the underlying\nstructure of the optimization model. The consistency of these different loss\nfunctions is guaranteed under the assumption of i.i.d. training data.\nNevertheless, various types of data are often dependent, such as power load\nfluctuations over time. This dependent nature can lead to diminished model\nperformance in testing or real-world applications. Motivated to make\nintelligent predictions for time series data, we present an autoregressive SPO\nmethod directly targeting the optimization problem at the decision stage in\nthis paper, where the conditions of consistency are no longer met. Therefore,\nwe first analyze the generalization bounds of the SPO loss within our\nautoregressive model. Subsequently, the uniform calibration results in Liu and\nGrigas [2] are extended in the proposed model. Finally, we conduct experiments\nto empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the SPO+ surrogate compared to\nthe absolute loss and the least squares loss, especially when the cost vectors\nare determined by stationary dynamical systems and demonstrate the relationship\nbetween normalized regret and mixing coefficients.",

This paper outlines in\ndetail a conceptual framework for the implementation of edge computing\nmicroservices in order to address the shortcomings of traditional centralized\narchitectures. Specifically, as edge computing allows for certain activities\nsuch as seat inventory checks, booking processes and even confirmation to be\ndone nearer to the user, thus lessening the overall response time and improving\nthe performance of the system. In addition, the framework value should include\nachieving the high performance of the system such as low latency, high\nthroughput and higher user experience. The major design components include\ndeployed distributed computing microservices orchestrated by Kubernetes,\nreal-time message processing system with Kafka and its elastic scaling. Other\noperational components include Prometheus and Grafana, which are used to\nmonitor and manage resources, ensuring that all operational processes are\noptimized. Although this research focuses on a design and theoretical scheming\nof the framework, its use is foreseen to be more advantageous in facilitating a\ntransform in the provision of services in the airline industry by improving\ncustomers' satisfaction, providing infrastructure which is cheap to install and\nefficiently supporting technology changes such as artificial intelligence and\ninternet of things embedded systems.

In this work, we present a library of ten\nnon-radiative, ideal GRMHD simulations that were utilized by the EHT\nCollaboration in their analysis of Sagittarius A*. The parameter survey\nexplores both low (SANE) and high (MAD) magnetization states across five black\nhole spins $a_{*}=-15/16,-1/2,0,+1/2,+15/16$ where each simulation was run out\nto $30,000\\hspace{0.1cm}\\mathrm{GM/c}^{3}$.

This leads to spin\nequilibrium around $a_{*}\\sim0.94$, consistent with previous studies. We study\nthe flow of conserved quantities in our simulations and find mass, angular\nmomentum, and energy transport in SANE accretion flows to be primarily inward\nand fluid-dominated. MAD models produce powerful jets with outflow efficiency\n$>1$ for $a_{*}=+0.94$, leading to black hole spin-down in prograde cases.

Most text retrieval systems are tailored\nfor natural language queries, often neglecting the specific challenges of\nretrieving code.

Our 7B model sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in code retrieval,\noutperforming the previous leading model, Voyage-Code, by over 20% on CoIR\nbenchmark. In addition to excelling in code retrieval, our models demonstrate\ncompetitive performance on the widely adopted BeIR text retrieval benchmark,\noffering versatility across domains.

This thesis\ntackles these issues by introducing a series of advancements that progressively\nbuild upon each other, enhancing the controllability and editability of\ntext-to-music generation models.\n  First, we introduce Loop Copilot, a system that tries to address the need for\niterative refinement in music creation. Loop Copilot leverages a large language\nmodel (LLM) to coordinate multiple specialised AI models, enabling users to\ngenerate and refine music interactively through a conversational interface.\nCentral to this system is the Global Attribute Table, which records and\nmaintains key musical attributes throughout the iterative process, ensuring\nthat modifications at any stage preserve the overall coherence of the music.\nWhile Loop Copilot excels in orchestrating the music creation process, it does\nnot directly address the need for detailed edits to the generated content.\n  To overcome this limitation, MusicMagus is presented as a further solution\nfor editing AI-generated music. MusicMagus introduces a zero-shot text-to-music\nediting approach that allows for the modification of specific musical\nattributes, such as genre, mood, and instrumentation, without the need for\nretraining. By manipulating the latent space within pre-trained diffusion\nmodels, MusicMagus ensures that these edits are stylistically coherent and that\nnon-targeted attributes remain unchanged.

For entanglement to occur, mechanical\nfrequency $\\omega_m$, dissipation rate $\\gamma_m$, environmental temperature\n$T$, oscillator density $\\rho$, and the form factor $\\Lambda$-determined by the\ngeometry and arrangement of oscillators-must satisfy a specific constraint.\nThis constraint, intrinsic to the noise model, is considered universal and\ncannot be improved by quantum control. Given the difficulty in further\noptimizing $\\omega_m$, $\\gamma_m$, $\\rho$, and $T$, optimizing $\\Lambda$ can\nrelax the constraints on these parameters. In this work, we prove that the form\nfactor has a supremum of $2\\pi$, revealing a fundamental limit of the\noscillator system. We propose designs that approach this supremum, nearly an\norder of magnitude higher than typical spherical oscillators. This optimization\ncould ease experimental constraints and bring quantum gravity validation based\non gravity-induced entanglement closer to realization.",

    "abstract": "Reflection is widely recognized as a cornerstone of student development,\nfostering critical thinking, self-regulation, and deep conceptual\nunderstanding. Traditionally, reflective skills have been cultivated through\nstructured feedback, mentorship, and guided self-assessment. However, these\napproaches often face challenges such as limited scalability, difficulties in\ndelivering individualized feedback, and a shortage of instructors proficient in\nfacilitating meaningful reflection. This study pioneers the use of generative\nAI, specifically large language models (LLMs), as an innovative solution to\nthese limitations. By leveraging the capacity of LLMs to deliver personalized,\ncontext-sensitive feedback at scale, this research investigates their potential\nto serve as effective facilitators of reflective exercises, sustaining deep\nengagement and promoting critical thinking. Through in-depth analyses of prompt\nengineering strategies and simulated multi-turn dialogues grounded in a\nproject-based learning (PBL) context, the study demonstrates that, with\npedagogically aligned prompts, LLMs can serve as accessible and adaptive tools\nfor scalable reflective guidance. Furthermore, LLM-assisted evaluation is\nemployed to objectively assess the performance of both tutors and students\nacross multiple dimensions of reflective learning. The findings contribute to\nthe evolving understanding of AI's role in reflective pedagogy and point to new\nopportunities for advancing AI-driven intelligent tutoring systems.",

Here we explore more\ngeneral properties of the dynamics of quantum annealers, going beyond the\nlow-energy regime. We show that the unitary evolution operator describing the\ncomplete dynamics is typically highly quantum chaotic. As a result, the\nannealing dynamics naturally leads to volume-law entangled random-like states\nwhen the initial configuration is rotated away from the low-energy subspace.\nFurthermore, we observe that the Heisenberg dynamics of a quantum annealer\nleads to extensive operator spreading, a hallmark of quantum information\nscrambling.

In this work, we overcome this challenge by\nutilizing the high kinetic inductance offered by superconducting granular\naluminum (grAl). We demonstrate lumped-element inductors with a few nH of\ninductance that are up to $100$ times more compact than inductors built from\npure aluminum (Al). To characterize the properties of these linear inductors,\nwe first report on the performance of lumped-element resonators built entirely\nout of grAl with sheet inductances varying from $30-320\\,$pH/sq and self-Kerr\nnon-linearities of $0.2-20\\,\\mathrm{Hz/photon}$. Further, we demonstrate\nex-situ integration of these grAl inductors into hybrid resonators with Al or\ntantalum (Ta) capacitor electrodes without increasing total internal losses.\nInterestingly, the measured internal quality factors systematically decrease\nwith increasing room-temperature resistivity of the grAl film for all devices,\nindicating a trade-off between compactness and internal loss.

Although\nsupervised learning techniques have proven to be effective in performing this\ntask, they heavily depend on large amounts of annotated training data.

Thus, it enables the generation of dense segmentation\nmasks as pseudo labels for unlabelled data.

First,\nwe design a provably effective unlearning algorithm for topic models that\nincurs a computational overhead independent of the size of the original\ndataset. Our analysis additionally quantifies the deletion capacity of the\nmodel -- i.e., the number of examples that can be unlearned without incurring a\nsignificant cost in model performance. Finally, we formally extend our analyses\nto account for adaptation to a given downstream task. In particular, we design\nan efficient algorithm to perform unlearning after fine-tuning the topic model\nvia a linear head.

    "abstract": "The capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models have been sketched\nout in great detail in recent years, providing an intriguing yet conflicting\npicture. On the one hand, LLMs demonstrate a general ability to solve problems.\nOn the other hand, they show surprising reasoning gaps when compared to humans,\ncasting doubt on the robustness of their generalisation strategies. The sheer\nvolume of data used in the design of LLMs has precluded us from applying the\nmethod traditionally used to measure generalisation: train-test set separation.\nTo overcome this, we study what kind of generalisation strategies LLMs employ\nwhen performing reasoning tasks by investigating the pretraining data they rely\non. For two models of different sizes (7B and 35B) and 2.5B of their\npretraining tokens, we identify what documents influence the model outputs for\nthree simple mathematical reasoning tasks and contrast this to the data that\nare influential for answering factual questions. We find that, while the models\nrely on mostly distinct sets of data for each factual question, a document\noften has a similar influence across different reasoning questions within the\nsame task, indicating the presence of procedural knowledge. We further find\nthat the answers to factual questions often show up in the most influential\ndata. However, for reasoning questions the answers usually do not show up as\nhighly influential, nor do the answers to the intermediate reasoning steps.\nWhen we characterise the top ranked documents for the reasoning questions\nqualitatively, we confirm that the influential documents often contain\nprocedural knowledge, like demonstrating how to obtain a solution using\nformulae or code. Our findings indicate that the approach to reasoning the\nmodels use is unlike retrieval, and more like a generalisable strategy that\nsynthesises procedural knowledge from documents doing a similar form of\nreasoning.",

Conventional high-dimensional regression inference methods suffer from\ninaccurate type I errors and reduced power in heavy-tailed contexts, limiting\ntheir effectiveness. Our proposed approach leverages the partial Gini\ncovariance to construct a robust statistical inference framework that requires\nminimal tuning and does not impose restrictive moment conditions on error\ndistributions. Unlike traditional methods, it circumvents the need for\nestimating the density of random errors and enhances the computational\nfeasibility and robustness. Extensive simulations demonstrate the proposed\nmethod's superior power and robustness over standard high-dimensional inference\napproaches, such as those based on the debiased Lasso. The asymptotic relative\nefficiency analysis provides additional theoretical insight on the improved\nefficiency of the new approach in the heavy-tailed setting. Additionally, the\npartial Gini covariance extends to the multivariate setting, enabling\nchi-square testing for a group of coefficients.

    "abstract": "The velocities of Ic-BL supernovae can be determined using two techniques\n(spline fitting and template fitting), sometimes resulting in different\nvelocities for the same event. This work compares and contrasts both methods,\nidentifying sources of error which are not accounted for by most authors and\nquantifying their impact on the final velocity measurement. Finally, it\nidentifies the cause of velocity discrepancies for events measured using both\nmethods. We quantified the impact of pre-smoothing the spectra prior to use of\nboth methods using two well-sampled cases. To identify the source of velocity\ndiscrepancies, two cases were measured and directly compared. Additional\nsources of error for template fitting arise due to the choice of phase of the\ntemplate spectrum ($\\sim$1000 km/s) and smoothing of the input spectrum\n($\\sim$500 km/s). The impact of phase shifts is minimised at peak time. The\nspline fitting method tends to underestimate uncertainties by around 1000 km/s.\nThis method can also be impacted by fine tuning of the smoothing parameters\n($\\sim$500-1000 km/s). Optimum smoothing parameters for different cases are\npresented along with suggestions for best practice. Direct comparison of both\nmethods showed that velocity discrepancies are not always present, debunking\nthe claim that the template fitting method always handles blending better than\nspline fitting. Spline fitting seems to struggle to handle blending only in\ncases where the Fe II features are superimposed on a red continuum, which\nbiases the minimum of this feature towards the bluest line of the triplet,\ncreating an artificially higher velocity. This situation may be relatively rare\namong Ic-BLs, based on typical temperature evolution. Both methods can be\napplied under certain circumstances with similar results.

Using the Landauer-B\\\"uttiker approach, we identify\ntwo contributions: background noise and excess noise, analyzing them when both\nelectrical and thermal biases are applied. When temperature biases are present,\nand superconducting terminals are grounded, we find that the first contribution\ndepends not only on the electrical conductance, as the Johnson-Nyquist at\nequilibrium, but also on a quantity strictly related to the heat conductance.\nThis is our first main result. On the other hand, the second contribution\nshows, as expected, additional terms originating from the partitioning of\ncurrents into different transport channels, including the ones associated with\nAndreev reflection processes. However, noise induced by the temperature\ndifferences unveil also interference terms that cannot be present either in\nvoltage bias or in the absence of any Andreev processes. Finally, we apply the\nresults obtained to two different specific physical situations. The first is a\ngeneric three-terminal normal-superconductor-normal system, and the second is a\ndevice based on spin-resolved co-propagating chiral channels in the integer\nquantum Hall regime with a superconducting region.

To\ninvestigate this, we applied tools from revealed preference theory to nearly 40\nleading LLMs, presenting each with many structured moral dilemmas spanning five\nfoundational dimensions of ethical reasoning. Using a probabilistic rationality\ntest, we found that at least one model from each major provider exhibited\nbehavior consistent with approximately stable moral preferences, acting as if\nguided by an underlying utility function.

Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency\nof various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and\ntranslating it into physically relevant insights.

Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised\nmethod for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum\nextractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a\nhigh-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP\nand LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios.\nNonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after\nlocal signal denoising.

Source-free Open-set Domain\nAdaptation (SF-OSDA) methods address OSDA without accessing labeled source\ndata, making them particularly relevant under privacy constraints. However,\nSF-OSDA presents significant challenges due to distribution shifts and the\nintroduction of novel classes. Existing SF-OSDA methods typically rely on\nthresholding the prediction entropy of a sample to identify it as either a\nknown or unknown class, but fail to explicitly learn discriminative features\nfor the target-private unknown classes. We propose Recall and Refine (RRDA), a\nnovel SF-OSDA framework designed to address these limitations by explicitly\nlearning features for target-private unknown classes. RRDA employs a two-stage\nprocess. First, we enhance the model's capacity to recognize unknown classes by\ntraining a target classifier with an additional decision boundary,guided by\nsynthetic samples generated from target domain features. This enables the\nclassifier to effectively separate known and unknown classes. Second, we adapt\nthe entire model to the target domain, addressing both domain shifts and\ndistinguishability to unknown classes.

In this paper, we propose novel time\ndivision multiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA)\ncommunication protocols for cooperative transmission in IIoT subnetworks. These\nprotocols leverage secondary access points (sAPs) as Decode-and-Forward (DF)\nand Amplify-and-Forward (AF) relays, enabling shorter cycle times while\nminimizing overall transmit power. A classification mechanism determines\nwhether the highest-gain link for each IoT device is a single-hop or two-hop\nconnection, and selects the corresponding sAP. We then formulate the problem of\nminimizing transmit power for DF/AF relaying while adhering to the delay and\nmaximum power constraints. In the FDMA case, an additional constraint is\nintroduced for bandwidth allocation to IoT devices during the first and second\nphases of cooperative transmission. To tackle the nonconvex problem, we employ\nthe sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method. We extend our\nanalysis to a system model with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs),\nenabling transmission through direct and RIS-assisted channels, and optimizing\nfor a multi-RIS scenario for comparative analysis. Simulation results show that\nour cooperative communication approach reduces the emitted power by up to 7.5\ndB while maintaining an outage probability and a resource overflow rate below\n$10^{-6}$.

    "abstract": "Tactile interaction plays an essential role in human-to-human interaction.\nPeople gain comfort and support from tactile interactions with others and touch\nis an important predictor for trust. While touch has been explored as a\ncommunicative modality in HCI and HRI, we here report on two studies in which\ntouching a social robot is used to regulate people's stress levels and\nconsequently their actions. In the first study, we look at whether different\nintensities of tactile interaction result in a physiological response related\nto stress, and whether the interaction impacts risk-taking behaviour and trust.\nWe let 38 participants complete a Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), a\ncomputer-based game that serves as a proxy for risk-taking behaviour. In our\nstudy, participants are supported by a robot during the BART task. The robot\nbuilds trust and encourages participants to take more risk. The results show\nthat affective tactile interaction with the robot increases participants'\nrisk-taking behaviour, but gentle affective tactile interaction increases\ncomfort and lowers stress whereas high-intensity touch does not. We also find\nthat male participants exhibit more risk-taking behaviour than females while\nbeing less stressed. Based on this experiment, a second study is used to\nascertain whether these effects are caused by the social nature of tactile\ninteraction or by the physical interaction alone. For this, instead of a social\nrobot, participants now have a tactile interaction with a non-social device.\nThe non-social interaction does not result in any effect, leading us to\nconclude that tactile interaction with humanoid robots is a social phenomenon\nrather than a mere physical phenomenon.",

In this framework the measurement device is\nmodeled via a probe QFT that, after interacting with the target QFT, is subject\nto an arbitrary local measurement. While the FV framework is rich enough to\ncarry out quantum state tomography, it has two drawbacks. First, it is unclear\nif the FV framework allows conducting arbitrary local measurements. Second, if\nthe probe field is interpreted as physical and the FV framework as fundamental,\nthen one must demand the probe measurement to be itself implementable within\nthe framework. That would involve a new probe, which should also be subject to\nan FV measurement, and so on. It is unknown if there exist non-trivial FV\nmeasurements for which such an \"FV-Heisenberg cut\" can be moved arbitrarily far\naway. In this work, we advance the first problem by proving that measurements\nof locally smeared fields fit within the FV framework.

While in certain configurations the network displays genuine\nmultipartite entanglement (GME) for any system size provided the noise level is\nbelow a certain threshold, in others GME is washed out if the system size is\nbig enough for any fixed non-zero level of noise. However, this difference has\nonly been established considering the two extreme cases of maximally and\nminimally connected networks (i.e. complete graphs versus trees, respectively).\nIn this article we investigate this question much more in depth and relate this\nbehavior to the growth of several graph theoretic parameters that measure the\nconnectivity of the graph sequence that codifies the structure of the network\nas the number of parties increases. The strongest conditions are obtained when\nconsidering the degree growth.

    "abstract": "Despite the impressive performance of large multimodal models (LMMs) in\nhigh-level visual tasks, their capacity for image quality assessment (IQA)\nremains limited. One main reason is that LMMs are primarily trained for\nhigh-level tasks (e.g., image captioning), emphasizing unified image semantics\nextraction under varied quality. Such semantic-aware yet quality-insensitive\nperception bias inevitably leads to a heavy reliance on image semantics when\nthose LMMs are forced for quality rating. In this paper, instead of retraining\nor tuning an LMM costly, we propose a training-free debiasing framework, in\nwhich the image quality prediction is rectified by mitigating the bias caused\nby image semantics. Specifically, we first explore several semantic-preserving\ndistortions that can significantly degrade image quality while maintaining\nidentifiable semantics. By applying these specific distortions to the query or\ntest images, we ensure that the degraded images are recognized as poor quality\nwhile their semantics remain. During quality inference, both a query image and\nits corresponding degraded version are fed to the LMM along with a prompt\nindicating that the query image quality should be inferred under the condition\nthat the degraded one is deemed poor quality.This prior condition effectively\naligns the LMM's quality perception, as all degraded images are consistently\nrated as poor quality, regardless of their semantic difference.Finally, the\nquality scores of the query image inferred under different prior conditions\n(degraded versions) are aggregated using a conditional probability model.\nExtensive experiments on various IQA datasets show that our debiasing framework\ncould consistently enhance the LMM performance and the code will be publicly\navailable.",

S3TU-Net is built on a multi-view CNN-Transformer hybrid\narchitecture, incorporating superpixel algorithms, structured weighting, and\nspatial shifting techniques to achieve superior segmentation performance.

Additionally, the residual-based\nsuperpixel visual transformer (RM-SViT) effectively merges global and local\nfeatures by employing sparse correlation learning and multi-branch attention to\ncapture long-range dependencies, with residual connections enhancing stability\nand computational efficiency. Experimental results on the LIDC-IDRI dataset\ndemonstrate that S3TU-Net achieves a DSC, precision, and IoU of 89.04%, 90.73%,\nand 90.70%, respectively.

Depthwise separable convolution\nand quantization further reduce the memory footprint and computational demands,\nalbeit with some performance trade-offs. Specifically, applying depthwise\nseparable convolutions to the model with the LSTM results in only a 0.72%\ndegradation in MSE score while reducing MACs by 58.66%.

However, only a fraction of customers take the CSAT survey\nafter the call, leading to a biased and inaccurate average CSAT value, and\nmissed opportunities for coaching, follow-up, and rectification. Therefore,\ncall centers can benefit from a model predicting customer satisfaction on calls\nwhere the customer did not complete the survey. Given that CSAT is a closely\nmonitored KPI, it is critical to minimize any bias in the average predicted\nCSAT (pCSAT). In this paper, we introduce a method such that predicted CSAT\n(pCSAT) scores accurately replicate the distribution of survey CSAT responses\nfor every call center with sufficient data in a live production environment.\nThe method can be applied to many multiclass classification problems to improve\nthe class balance and minimize its changes upon model updates.",

However, both Transformers and LRNNs struggle to perform\nstate-tracking, which may impair performance in tasks such as code evaluation.\nIn one forward pass, current architectures are unable to solve even parity, the\nsimplest state-tracking task, which non-linear RNNs can handle effectively.\nRecently, Sarrof et al. (2024) demonstrated that the failure of LRNNs like\nMamba to solve parity stems from restricting the value range of their diagonal\nstate-transition matrices to $[0, 1]$ and that incorporating negative values\ncan resolve this issue. We extend this result to non-diagonal LRNNs such as\nDeltaNet. We prove that finite precision LRNNs with state-transition matrices\nhaving only positive eigenvalues cannot solve parity, while non-triangular\nmatrices are needed to count modulo $3$. Notably, we also prove that LRNNs can\nlearn any regular language when their state-transition matrices are products of\nidentity minus vector outer product matrices, each with eigenvalues in the\nrange $[-1, 1]$. Our experiments confirm that extending the eigenvalue range of\nMamba and DeltaNet to include negative values not only enables them to solve\nparity but consistently improves their performance on state-tracking tasks. We\nalso show that state-tracking enabled LRNNs can be pretrained stably and\nefficiently at scale (1.3B parameters), achieving competitive performance on\nlanguage modeling and showing promise on code and math tasks.",

The functionalization of SWCNTs with\nluminescent defects can lead to significantly enhanced photoluminescence (PL)\nproperties due to efficient trapping of highly mobile excitons and red-shifted\nemission from these trap states. Among the most studied luminescent defect\ntypes are oxygen and aryl defects that have largely similar optical properties.\nSo far, no direct comparison between SWCNTs functionalized with oxygen and aryl\ndefects under identical conditions has been performed. Here, we employ a\ncombination of spectroscopic techniques to quantify the number of defects,\ntheir distribution along the nanotubes and thus their exciton trapping\nefficiencies. The different slopes of Raman D/G+ ratios versus calculated\ndefect densities from PL quantum yield measurements indicate substantial\ndissimilarities between oxygen and aryl defects. Supported by statistical\nanalysis of single-nanotube PL spectra at cryogenic temperatures it reveals\nclustering of oxygen defects. The clustering of 2-3 oxygen defects, which act\nas a single exciton trap, occurs irrespective of the functionalization method\nand thus enables the use of simple equations to determine the density of oxygen\ndefects and oxygen defect clusters in SWCNTs based on standard Raman\nspectroscopy. The presented analytical approach is a versatile and sensitive\ntool to study defect distribution and clustering in SWCNTs and can be applied\nto any new functionalization method.",

To proceed,\nthe tests constructed via the likelihood ratio (LR) and the union-intersection\n(UI) principles are studied. For the problems of testing against restricted\nalternatives, first, we show that the LRT and the UIT are not the proper Bayes\ntests, however, they are shown to be the integrated LRT and the integrated UIT,\nrespectively. For the problem of testing against the positive orthant space\nalternative, both the null distributions of the LRT and the UIT depend on the\nunknown nuisance covariance matrix. Hence we have difficulty adopting Fisher's\napproach to reporting $p$-values. On the other hand, according to the\ndefinition of the level of significance, both the LRT and the UIT are shown to\nbe power-dominated by the corresponding LRT and UIT for testing against the\nhalf-space alternative, respectively. Hence, both the LRT and the UIT are\n$\\alpha$-inadmissible, these results are against the common statistical sense.\nNeither Fisher's approach of reporting $p$-values alone nor Neyman-Pearson's\noptimal theory for power function alone is a satisfactory criterion for\nevaluating the performance of tests.

Current approaches to address SR tasks, such as transformer-based\nand diffusion-based methods, are either dedicated to extracting RGB image\nfeatures or assuming similar degradation patterns, neglecting the inherent\nmodal disparities between infrared and visible images. When directly applied to\ninfrared image SR tasks, these methods inevitably distort the infrared spectral\ndistribution, compromising the machine perception in downstream tasks.

Our approach captures\nhigh-pass subbands from multi-scale and multi-directional infrared spectral\ndecomposition to recover infrared-degraded information through a gate\narchitecture. The proposed Spectral Fidelity Loss regularizes the spectral\nfrequency distribution during reconstruction, which ensures the preservation of\nboth high- and low-frequency components and maintains the fidelity of\ninfrared-specific features. We propose a two-stage prompt-learning optimization\nto guide the model in learning infrared HR characteristics from LR degradation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing image\nSR models in both visual and perceptual tasks while notably enhancing machine\nperception in downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae are a promising yet\nchallenging target for detection due to the stochastic and complex nature of\nthese signals. Conventional detection methods for core-collapse supernovae rely\non excess energy searches because matched filtering has been hindered by the\nlack of well-defined waveform templates. However, numerical simulations of\ncore-collapse supernovae have improved our understanding of the gravitational\nwave signals they emit, which enables us, for the first time, to construct a\nset of templates that closely resemble predictions from numerical simulations.\nIn this study, we investigate the possibility of detecting gravitational waves\nfrom core-collapse supernovae using a matched-filtering methods. We construct a\ntheoretically-informed template bank and use it to recover a core-collapse\nsupernova signal injected into real LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector data. We evaluate\nthe detection efficiency of the matched-filtering approach and how well the\ninjected signal is reconstructed. We discuss the false alarm rate of our\napproach and investigate the main source of false triggers. We recover 88\\% of\nthe signals injected at a distance of 1 kpc and 50% of the signals injected at\n2 kpc. For more than 50% of the recovered events, the underlying signal\ncharacteristics are reconstructed within an error of 15%. We discuss the\nstrengths and limitations of this approach and identify areas for further\nimprovements to advance the potential of matched filtering for supernova\ngravitational-wave detection.

    "abstract": "In this work, we elaborate further on a 4D cosmological Running-Vacuum-type\nModel (RVM) of inflation that characterises string-inspired Chern-Simons (CS)\ngravity. It has been shown that inflation in such models is caused by a\ncondensation of the gravitational CS (gCS) terms induced by primordial\ngravitational waves (GW), which leads to a linear-axion potential, thus\nbreaking the shift symmetry, and lifting its periodicity (monodromy). We\ndemonstrate here that this inflationary phase may be metastable, due to the\nexistence of non-trivial imaginary parts of the gCS condensate. These imaginary\nparts are quantum effects, proportional to appropriate commutators of GW\nperturbations. As we stress, their existence is quantum-ordering-scheme\ndependent. We argue here in favor of a physical importance of such imaginary\nparts, which we compute to second order in the GW (tensor) perturbations in the\nframework of a specific gauge-fixed effective Lagrangian, within a (mean field)\nweak-quantum-gravity path integral approach. We pay specific attention to the\nvarious space-time boundary terms. We thus provide an estimate of the life time\nof inflation. On matching our results with the relevant inflationary\nphenomenology, we fix the quantum-ordering ambiguities, and obtain an\norder-of-magnitude constraint on the ratio of the string energy scale $M_s$ in\nthis model to the (four-spacetime-dimensional) reduced Planck mass $M_{\\rm\nPl}$, specifically, $M_s/M_{\\rm Pl} = \\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. This is consistent\nwith the corresponding estimate obtained in previous analyses by the authors in\nthis framework, based on a dynamical-system approach to linear-axion RVM\ninflation. Finally, we examine the role of periodic modulations in the axion\npotential induced by non-perturbative stringy effects on the slow-roll\ninflationary parameters, and find compatibility with the cosmological data.",

Our method\nseparates light effects from tissue properties. PR-ENDO enhances 3D Gaussian\nSplatting with a physically based relightable model. We boost the traditional\nlight transport formulation with a specialized MLP capturing complex\nlight-related effects while ensuring reduced artifacts and better\ngeneralization across novel views. PR-ENDO achieves superior reconstruction\nquality compared to baseline methods on both public and in-house datasets.\nUnlike existing approaches, PR-ENDO enables tissue modifications while\npreserving a physically accurate response to light, making it closer to\nreal-world clinical use.",

The HA in season 2020/21 (with spectator ban during\nmost matches) was very close to the pre-COVID-19 season 2018/19, indicating\nthat teams became accustomed to the absence of spectators. For season 2021/22,\nwith varying spectator regulations, we detect a U-shaped relationship between\nHA and the stadium utilisation rate, where HA increases considerably for\nmatches with medium stadium utilisation which is associated with a larger\ndifference in running distance between the home and away teams.",

More specifically, probing--training a downstream head on a\npre-trained encoder--has been widely adopted in transfer learning, which helps\nto prevent overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. However, such\ngeneralizability of pre-trained encoders raises concerns about the potential\nmisuse of probing for harmful intentions, such as discriminatory speculation\nand warfare applications. In this work, we introduce EncoderLock, a novel\napplicability authorization method designed to protect pre-trained encoders\nfrom malicious probing, i.e., yielding poor performance on specified prohibited\ndomains while maintaining their utility in authorized ones. Achieving this\nbalance is challenging because of the opposite optimization objectives and the\nvariety of downstream heads that adversaries can utilize adaptively. To address\nthese challenges, EncoderLock employs two techniques: domain-aware weight\nselection and updating to restrict applications on prohibited domains/tasks,\nand self-challenging training scheme that iteratively strengthens resistance\nagainst any potential downstream classifiers that adversaries may apply.\nMoreover, recognizing the potential lack of data from prohibited domains in\npractical scenarios, we introduce three EncoderLock variants with different\nlevels of data accessibility: supervised (prohibited domain data with labels),\nunsupervised (prohibited domain data without labels), and zero-shot (no data or\nlabels available). We verify EncoderLock's effectiveness and practicality with\na real-world pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder from Facebook.

    "abstract": "How a cloud ensemble responds to external forcing is a puzzle in tropical\nconvection research. Convectively coupled gravity waves (CCGWs) in a finite\ndomain have controllable wavelengths, providing a convenient simulation setup\nfor studying the cloud ensemble. A multiscale analysis shows that the growth of\nCCGWs in a finite-domain involves not only the amplitude growth of individual\nclouds but also the synchronization of convective lifecycles. To understand the\nsynchronization mechanism, we build a microscopic model with many clouds. For\neach cloud, the microscopic model simulates the evolution of equivalent\npotential temperature $\\theta_e$ in the boundary layer, which is reduced by\nconvective transport and radiative cooling and increased by surface heating. At\nthe shallow convection stage, the $\\theta_e$ grows until reaching an upper\nthreshold where the convective inhibition energy is eliminated, and the system\ntransitions to the deep convection stage. At the deep convection stage, the\n$\\theta_e$ drops until reaching a lower threshold where the convective\navailable potential energy is exhausted, and the system transitions to the\nshallow convection stage. The wave influences $\\theta_e$ with the boundary\nlayer convergent flow and adjusts the phase of the convective lifecycle.\nNumerical simulations of the microscopic model show that when the period of\nconvection and wave equals, the wave gradually synchronizes convection.\nTheoretical analysis shows that the microscopic synchronization appears as the\nmacroscopic resonant growth of the cloud ensemble. In the resonant state, the\naveraged $\\theta_e$ and vertical velocity in the boundary layer are in phase,\nagreeing with the cloud-permitting simulation.",

The main application we have in mind refers to\ntumor growth models: in particular, the equation for the chemical prescribes\nthat such a substance tends to migrate towards the regions where the tumor\ncells are more dense and consume it more actively. The cross-diffusion effects\ncharacterizing the system are similar to those occurring in the Keller-Segel\nmodel for chemotaxis. There is, however, a profound difference between the two\nsettings: actually, the Cahn-Hilliard system prescribes a fourth-order dynamics\nwith respect to space variables, whereas most models for chemotaxis are of the\nsecond order in space. This fact has a number of specific consequences\nregarding regularity properties of solutions and conditions ensuring existence.\nOur main results are devoted to proving existence of weak solutions in the case\nwhen the chemotactic sensitivity function depends nonlinearly on the chemical\nspecies concentration, and, more precisely, has a slow growth at infinity so to\navoid finite-time blowup.

We now\nconsider the stronger inviscid forcing corresponding to the vertical\noscillation of the inner boundary.\n  We limit our analysis to two-dimensional geometries but examine three\ndifferent configurations: freely-propagating wave beams in an unbounded domain\nand two wave patterns (a periodic orbit and an attractor) in a cylindrical\nshell geometry. The asymptotic structures of the internal shear layers are\nassumed to follow the similarity solution of Moore \\& Saffman (\\textit{Phil.\nTrans. R. Soc. Lond.

For each case, the derivation of the latter is\nachieved either through separation of variables combined with analytical\ncontinuation or the method of characteristics. Global inviscid solutions, when\nobtained, closely match numerical solutions for small Ekman numbers far from\nthe critical lines, while viscous asymptotic solutions show excellent\nperformance near those lines. The amplitude scalings of the internal shear\nlayers excited by an inviscid forcing are found to be divergent as the Ekman\nnumber $E$ decreases, specifically $O(E^{-1/6})$ for the critical point\nsingularity and $O(E^{-1/3})$ for attractors, in contrast to the convergent\nscalings found for a viscous forcing.",

(2019), we observe a strong dependence of the signal features\non the transverse profiles of the colliding laser pulses in the interaction\nregion. For a probe beam tailored such as to feature an annular far-field\nprofile and a pronounced on-axis focus peak counterpropagating a pump beam at\nzero impact parameter, the signal's main emission direction can undergo the\nanalog of a phase transition with the beam-waist ratio of the pulses serving as\na control parameter. Depending on the pump's beam profile, this phase\ntransition can be first order (e.g., for a pump with a flat-top far-field\nprofile) or second order (e.g., for a Gaussian pump). From the simulation data,\nwe determine the critical point and extract the corresponding critical exponent\nfor the second-order transition of the main emission direction of the signal in\nthe far field. For this, we improve the performance of the above numerical\ncode, using the phase transition analogs as an example to illustrate the\ncapabilities and limitations of the code and current workflows.",

During the five-day symposium, participants from 14\ncountries gathered to discuss recent advances in space sailing, investigating\nnew concepts and designs, describing innovative hardware and enabling\ntechnologies, strategies for dynamics and control, and providing updates on\ntesting results for systems under development and future mission applications.\nAs part of the 18 sessions, almost 50 oral presentations were held and,\nsubsequently, 17 papers were submitted for review and publication. This paper\naims to give an overview of all the cutting-edge technologies, detailed\nanalysis and promising results shared with the scientific community as part of\nthe event. Following the noteworthy deployment of the world's first solar sail\nIKAROS in 2010, missions like NanoSail-D2 (2011) and LightSail-2 (2019) have\nshowcased the potential of solar sailing technology through successful\ndemonstrations. Besides highlighting advancements in present and future\nprograms, the symposium was an opportunity to reflect on objectives, design and\ntest results from research centers and universities, as well as illustrate\napplications for interstellar travel, evaluate degrading performance and\nsuggest alternative solutions for known limitations.

Typically, this motion is driven\neither by the external fields or by mutual interaction between the colloids. In\nthe latter scenario, dynamics arise from non-reciprocal interaction among\ncolloids within a chemical environment. In contrast, we eliminate the need for\na chemical environment by utilizing a large area of optical illumination to\ngenerate thermal fields. The resulting optothermal interactions introduce\nnon-reciprocity to the system, enabling active motion of the colloidal\nstructure. Our approach involves two types of colloids: passive and thermally\nactive. The thermally active colloids contain absorbing elements that capture\nenergy from the incident optical beam, creating localized thermal fields around\nthem. In a suspension of these colloids, the thermal gradients generated drive\nnearby particles through attractive thermo-osmotic forces. We investigate the\nresulting dynamics, which lead to various swimming modes, including active\npropulsion and chiral motion. We have also experimentally validated certain\nsimulated results.

To address the effective\nhandling of high-dimensional data, the diversity of real noise, and the\nchallenges in estimating standard deviation of the noise, we propose a novel\nand general graph-based square-root estimation (GSRE) model for sparse linear\nregression. Specifically, we use square-root-loss function to encourage the\nestimators to be independent of the unknown standard deviation of the error\nterms and design a sparse regularization term by using the graphical structure\namong predictors in a node-by-node form. Based on the predictor graphs with\nspecial structure, we highlight the generality by analyzing that the model in\nthis paper is equivalent to several classic regression models. Theoretically,\nwe also analyze the finite sample bounds, asymptotic normality and model\nselection consistency of GSRE method without relying on the standard deviation\nof error terms. In terms of computation, we employ the fast and efficient\nalternating direction method of multipliers. Finally, based on a large number\nof simulated and real data with various types of noise, we demonstrate the\nperformance advantages of the proposed method in estimation, prediction and\nmodel selection.",

    "abstract": "Phagocytosis is the process by which cells, which are 5 to 10 times larger\nthan the particle size, engulf particles, holding substantial importance in\nvarious biological contexts ranging from the nutrient uptake of unicellular\norganisms to immune system of humans, animals etc. While the previous studies\nfocused primarily on the mechanism of phagocytosis, in this study we have a\ntaken a different route by studying the dynamics of the phagocytes in a system\nconsisting of many bacteria and a small number of phagocytes. We put forward a\nminimalist framework that models bacteria and phagocytes as active and passive\ncircular disks, respectively. The interactions are governed by directional\nforces: phagocytes are attracted toward bacteria, while bacteria experience a\nrepulsive force in proximity to phagocytes. Bacteria are capable of\nreproduction at a fixed rate, and the balance between bacterial reproduction\nand phagocytic engulfment is governed by the interplay of the two opposing\nforces. In attraction dominated regimes, bacterial populations decrease\nrapidly, while in repulsion dominated regimes, bacterial clusters grow and\nimpede phagocytes, often resulting in phagocyte trapping. Conversely, in\nattraction-dominated scenarios, only a few bacteria remain at later times,\nrendering the motion of the phagocytes diffusive. Further, the transition\nbetween the two regimes occurs through a regime of bi-stability. Our study\nfurther describes the dynamics of both species using the tools of statistical\nanalysis, offering insights into the internal dynamics of this system.",

In the full non-Markovian setup, the difference vanishes. The\nframework of zoom-in schemes clarifies the relationship between computations in\nstochastic inflation, linear perturbation theory, and the classical $\\Delta N$\nformalism.

In\nthis paper we derive a fluid model for collisionless dust, entrained in a\nturbulent gas, starting from the equations describing the motion of individual\ndust grains. We adopt a covariant formulation of our model to allow for the\ngeometry and coordinate systems prevalent in astrophysics, and provide a\nclosure valid for the accretion disc context. We show that the continuum\nmechanics properties of a dust fluid corresponds to a higher-dimensional\nanisotropic Maxwell fluid, after the extra dimensions are averaged out, with a\ndynamically important rheological stress tensor. This higher-dimensional\ntreatment has the advantage of keeping the dust velocity and velocity of the\nfluid seen, and their respective moments, on the same footing. This results in\na simplification of the constitutive relation describing the evolution of the\ndust Rheological stress.",

Recently, there has been\na growing focus on artificial intelligence-based approaches in BCSD due to\ntheir scalability and generalization. Because binaries are compiled with\ndifferent compilation configurations, existing approaches still face notable\nlimitations when comparing binary similarity. First, BCSD requires analysis on\ncode behavior, and existing work claims to extract semantic, but actually still\nmakes analysis in terms of syntax. Second, directly extracting features from\nassembly sequences, existing work cannot address the issues of instruction\nreordering and different syntax expressions caused by various compilation\nconfigurations. In this paper, we propose StrTune, which slices binary code\nbased on data dependence and perform slice-level fine-tuning. To address the\nfirst limitation, StrTune performs backward slicing based on data dependence to\ncapture how a value is computed along the execution. Each slice reflects the\ncollecting semantics of the code, which is stable across different compilation\nconfigurations. StrTune introduces flow types to emphasize the independence of\ncomputations between slices, forming a graph representation. To overcome the\nsecond limitation, based on slices corresponding to the same value computation\nbut having different syntax representation, StrTune utilizes a Siamese Network\nto fine-tune such pairs, making their representations closer in the feature\nspace.",

    "abstract": "Blind image restoration remains a significant challenge in low-level vision\ntasks. Recently, denoising diffusion models have shown remarkable performance\nin image synthesis. Guided diffusion models, leveraging the potent generative\npriors of pre-trained models along with a differential guidance loss, have\nachieved promising results in blind image restoration. However, these models\ntypically consider data consistency solely in the spatial domain, often\nresulting in distorted image content. In this paper, we propose a novel\nfrequency-aware guidance loss that can be integrated into various diffusion\nmodels in a plug-and-play manner. Our proposed guidance loss, based on 2D\ndiscrete wavelet transform, simultaneously enforces content consistency in both\nthe spatial and frequency domains. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method in three blind restoration tasks: blind image\ndeblurring, imaging through turbulence, and blind restoration for multiple\ndegradations. Notably, our method achieves a significant improvement in PSNR\nscore, with a remarkable enhancement of 3.72\\,dB in image deblurring. Moreover,\nour method exhibits superior capability in generating images with rich details\nand reduced distortion, leading to the best visual quality.",

    "abstract": "Capturing fresh information in near real-time and using it to augment\nexisting large language models (LLMs) is essential to generate up-to-date,\ngrounded, and reliable output. This problem becomes particularly challenging\nwhen LLMs are used for informational tasks in rapidly evolving fields, such as\nWeb search related to recent or unfolding events involving entities, where\ngenerating temporally relevant responses requires access to up-to-the-hour news\nsources. However, the information modeled by the parametric memory of LLMs is\noften outdated, and Web results from prototypical retrieval systems may fail to\ncapture the latest relevant information and struggle to handle conflicting\nreports in evolving news. To address this challenge, we present the NEON\nframework, designed to extract emerging entity interactions -- such as events\nor activities -- as described in news articles. NEON constructs an\nentity-centric timestamped knowledge graph that captures such interactions,\nthereby facilitating enhanced QA capabilities related to news events. Our\nframework innovates by integrating open Information Extraction (openIE) style\ntuples into LLMs to enable in-context retrieval-augmented generation. This\nintegration demonstrates substantial improvements in QA performance when\ntackling temporal, entity-centric search queries.

Integrating multiple\nmodulation formats transforms it into Routing Modulation Level and Spectrum\nAssignment (RMLSA) problem, thereby making it more challenging. Traditionally,\naddressing the RSA problem involved identifying a fixed number of paths and\nsubsequently allocating spectrum among them. Numerous heuristic and\nmetaheuristic approaches have been proposed for RSA using this two-step\nmethodology.

This approach involves augmenting the network into an\nAuxiliary Graph and transforming conventional ACO into a constraint-based ACO\nvariant that adapts to the constraints of EONs. This adaptation also includes\nan adaptive initiation process and an aggressive termination strategy aimed at\nachieving faster convergence.

Our method builds on locally consistent\ngrammars, a lightweight form of compression, combined with simple recompression\ntechniques to achieve further space reductions. Locally consistent grammar\nalgorithms are particularly suitable for scaling, as they need minimal\nsatellite information to compact the text. We introduce a novel concept to\nenable parallelisation, stable local consistency. A grammar algorithm ALG is\nstable, if for any pattern $P$ occurring in a collection $\\mathcal{T}=\\{T_1,\nT_2, \\ldots, T_k\\}$, the instances $ALG(T_1), ALG(T_2), \\ldots, ALG(T_k)$\nindependently produce cores for $P$ with the same topology. In a locally\nconsistent grammar, the core of $P$ is a subset of nodes and edges in\n$\\mathcal{T}$'s parse tree that remains the same in all the occurrences of $P$.\nThis feature is important to achieve compression, but it only holds if ALG\nsynchronises the parsing of the strings, for instance, by defining a common set\nof nonterminal symbols for them. Stability removes the need for synchronisation\nduring the parsing phase. Consequently, we can run $ALG(T_1), ALG(T_2), \\ldots,\nALG(T_k)$ fully in parallel and then merge the resulting grammars into a single\ncompressed output equivalent to $ALG(\\mathcal{T})$.

These systems can be modeled by\npiecewise linear time-delay dynamics, specifically using Petri nets with\npriority rules. A central question is to show the existence of stationary\nregimes (i.e., steady state solutions) -- taking the form of invariant\nhalf-lines -- from which essential performance indicators like the throughput\nand congestion phases can be derived. Our primary result proves the existence\nof stationary solutions under structural conditions involving the spectrum of\nthe linear parts within the piecewise linear dynamics. This extends to a\nbroader class of systems a fundamental theorem of Kohlberg (1980) dealing with\nnonexpansive dynamics. The proof of our result relies on topological degree\ntheory and the notion of ``Blackwell optimality'' from the theory of Markov\ndecision processes. Finally, we validate our findings by demonstrating that\nthese structural conditions hold for a wide range of dynamics, especially those\nstemming from Petri nets with priority rules.

    "abstract": "While traditional game models often simplify interactions among agents as\nstatic, real-world social relationships are inherently dynamic, influenced by\nboth immediate payoffs and alternative information. Motivated by this fact, we\nintroduce a coevolutionary multiplex network model that incorporates the\nconcepts of a relationship threshold and a recommendation mechanism to explore\nhow the strength of relationships among agents interacts with their strategy\nchoices within the framework of weak prisoner's dilemma games. In the\nrelationship layer, the relationship strength between agents varies based on\ninteraction outcomes. In return, the strategy choice of agents in the game\nlayer is influenced by both payoffs and relationship indices, and agents can\ninteract with distant agents through a recommendation mechanism. Simulation of\nvarious network topologies reveals that a higher average degree supports\ncooperation, although increased randomness in interactions may inhibit its\nformation. Interestingly, a higher threshold value of interaction quality is\ndetrimental, while the applied recommendation protocol can improve global\ncooperation. The best results are obtained when the relative weight of payoff\nis minimal and the individual fitness is dominated by the relationship indices\ngained from the quality of links to neighbors. As a consequence, the changes in\nthe distribution of relationship indices are closely correlated with overall\nlevels of cooperation.",

Prior work has addressed this\nissue mainly from a technical perspective and neglected other interfering\naspects such as the social media dimension. To fill this gap, we propose STRisk\nwhich is a predictive system where we expand the scope of the prediction task\nby bringing into play the social media dimension. We study over 3800 US\norganizations including both victim and non-victim organizations. For each\norganization, we design a profile composed of a variety of externally measured\ntechnical indicators and social factors. In addition, to account for unreported\nincidents, we consider the non-victim sample to be noisy and propose a noise\ncorrection approach to correct mislabeled organizations. We then build several\nmachine learning models to predict whether an organization is exposed to\nexperience a hacking breach. By exploiting both technical and social features,\nwe achieve a Area Under Curve (AUC) score exceeding 98%, which is 12% higher\nthan the AUC achieved using only technical features. Furthermore, our feature\nimportance analysis reveals that open ports and expired certificates are the\nbest technical predictors, while spreadability and agreeability are the best\nsocial predictors.",

In this study, we perform\nN-body simulations with the aim of verifying the existence of this correlation\nbetween radial action and scale height, thereby enhancing our comprehension of\nthe heating history of Galactic disks. We find that the relationship between\nradial action and scale height in our simulations can be described by the same\nfunctional form observed in previous work. Furthermore, the relationships\nderived from our simulations align well with those of the Galactic thin disk.\nHowever, they do not coincide with the inner thick disk but exhibit a rough\ncorrespondence with the outer thick disk, suggesting the possibility that\nadditional heating mechanisms may be required to explain the inner thick disk.\nWe also find that the mean radial action and scale height undergo rapid\nincreases during the initial stages of the simulation, yet remain relatively\nunchanged as the disk evolves further. By tracing example particles, we uncover\na correlation between radial and vertical heating in our simulation: as a\nparticle in the disk gains or loses radial action, its vertical motion tends to\noscillate on a more or less extended orbit, accompanied by a tendency to\nmigrate outward or inward, respectively. The massive, long-lasting particles in\nour simulation contribute to disk heating by solely enhancing the rate of\nincrease in scale height with radial action, while maintaining the functional\nform that describes the relationship between these two variables.",

Each proximal step can be formulated as a fixed-point equation and\nsolved with accelerated methods, such as Anderson's.

The method\nbegins by taking the first-order differencing and estimates its long-run\ncovariance function. Through eigen-decomposition, we obtain a set of estimated\nfunctional principal components and their associated scores for the differenced\nseries. These components allow us to reconstruct the original functional data\nand compute the residuals. To model the temporal patterns in the residuals, we\nagain perform dynamic functional principal component analysis and extract its\nestimated principal components and the associated scores for the residuals. As\na byproduct, we introduce a geometrically decaying weighted approach to assign\nhigher weights to the most recent data than those from the distant past. Using\nthe Swedish age-specific mortality rates from 1751 to 2022, we demonstrate that\nthe weighted dynamic functional factor model can produce more accurate point\nand interval forecasts, particularly for male series exhibiting higher\nvolatility.",

The asymmetric disk around the young star Oph-IRS\n48 has one of the most well-characterised chemical inventories, showing\nmolecular emission from a wide variety of species at the dust trap. One of the\nexplanations for the asymmetric structure is dust trapping by a\nperturbation-induced vortex. We aim to constrain the excitation properties of\nthe molecular species SO$_2$, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$CO. We further characterise\nthe extent of the molecular emission, through the determination of important\nphysical and chemical timescales at the location of the dust trap. We also\ninvestigate whether the potential vortex can influence the observable\ntemperature structure of the gas. Through a pixel-by-pixel rotational diagram\nanalysis, we create rotational temperature and column density maps for SO$_2$\nand CH$_3$OH, while temperature maps for H$_2$CO are created using line ratios.\nWe find temperatures of $T\\sim$55 K and $T\\sim$125 K for SO$_2$ and CH$_3$OH,\nrespectively, while the line ratios point towards temperatures of\nT$\\sim$150-300 K for H$_2$CO. The rotational diagram of CH$_3$OH is dominated\nby scatter and subsequent non-LTE RADEX calculations suggest that both CH$_3$OH\nand H$_2$CO must be sub-thermally excited. The temperatures suggest that SO$_2$\ncomes from a layer deep in the disk, while CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO originate from\na higher layer. While a potential radial gradient is seen in the temperature\nmap of SO$_2$, we do not find any hints of a vortex influencing the temperature\nstructure. The determined turbulent mixing timescale is not able to explain the\nemitting heights of the molecules, but the photodissociation timescales are\nable to explain the wider azimuthal extents of SO$_2$ and H$_2$CO compared to\nCH$_3$OH, where a secondary, gas-phase formation reservoir is required for\nH$_2$CO.",

In this paper we propose an $F$-subgraph tensor and an\n$F$-subgraph eigenvector centrality of $G$. When the graph is $F$-connected, we\nshow that the $F$-subgraph tensor is weakly irreducible, and in this case, the\n$F$-subgraph eigenvector centrality exists. Specifically, when we choose $F$ to\nbe a path $P_1$ of length $1$(or a complete graph $K_2$), the $F$-eigenvector\ncentrality is eigenvector centrality of $G$. Furthermore, we propose the\n$(K_2,F)$-subgraph eigenvector centrality of $G$ and prove it always exists\nwhen $G$ is connected. Specifically, the $P_2$-subgraph eigenvector centrality\nand $(K_2,F)$-subgraph eigenvector centrality are studied. Some examples show\nthat the ranking of vertices under them differs from the rankings under several\nclassic centralities. Vertices of a regular graph have the same eigenvector\ncentrality scores.

    "abstract": "In dynamic vehicle routing problems (DVRPs), some part of the information is\nrevealed or changed on the fly, and the decision maker has the opportunity to\nre-plan the vehicle routes during their execution, reflecting on the changes.\nAccordingly, the solution to a DVRP is a flexible policy rather than a set of\nfixed routes. A policy is basically a problem-specific algorithm that is\ninvoked at various decision points in the planning horizon and returns a\ndecision according to the current state. Since DVRPs involve dynamic decision\nmaking, a simulator is an essential tool for dynamically testing and evaluating\nthe policies. Despite this, there are few tools available that are specifically\ndesigned for this purpose. To fill this gap, we have developed a simulation\nframework that is suitable for a wide range of dynamic vehicle routing problems\nand allows to dynamically test different policies for the given problem. In\nthis paper, we present the background of this simulation tool, for which we\nproposed a general modeling framework suitable for formalizing DVRPs\nindependently of simulation purposes.

    "abstract": "Wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) is widely recognized as a useful\nmethod for simulation of turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers.\nNevertheless, a continual issue in different wall models is the shift of the\nmean velocity profile from the wall-model/RANS (Reynolds-averaged\nNavier-Stokes) region to the LES region. This phenomenon, referred to as\nlogarithmic layer mismatch (LLM), occurs in both wall shear stress models and\nhybrid RANS/LES models. Many efforts have been made to explain and resolve this\nmismatch, including decreasing the high correlation between the wall shear\nstress and the velocity at the matching layer, modifying the subgrid-scale\n(SGS) eddy viscosity, and adding a stochastic forcing. It is widely believed\nthat the inclusion of the resolved Reynolds shear stress (or the convection\nterm) is essential to elliminate the LLM, as it prevents the overseimation of\nthe modeled Reynolds shear stress and promotes the generation of the\nsmall-scale flow structures in the near-wall region. In this work, by comparing\nthree different SGS eddy viscosity models, we demonstrate that ensuring the\ntotal shear stress conservation (TSSC) conservation is key to resolving the\nLLM. Under the TSSC framework, the effect of the convection term on LLM can be\nquantitatively assessed. Furthermore, a modified SGS eddy viscosity modfication\nmodel that adheres to the TSSC constraint is tested at different Reynolds\nnumbers ($Re_\\tau=1000, 2000, 4200$). Our results demonstrate the robust\nperformance of the present model in predicting skin friction and low-order\nturbulence statistics, even under a relatively low grid resolution ($\\Delta\nx^+, \\Delta z^+ \\lesssim 500$, $2\\leq \\Delta_x/\\Delta_{y,mat} \\leq 4$, where\n$\\Delta_{y,mat}$ is the wall-normal grid spacing in the wall-model region).",

However, the\nexecution frequency of neutral atom quantum computers is constrained by image\nprocessing procedures, particularly the assembly of defect-free atom arrays,\nwhich is a crucial step in preparing qubits (atoms) for execution. To optimize\nthis assembly process, we propose a novel quadrant-based rearrangement\nalgorithm that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy and also enables the\nsimultaneous movement of multiple atoms, even across different columns and\nrows. We implement the algorithm on FPGA to handle each quadrant independently\n(hardware-level optimization) while maximizing parallelization.

This\nachievement also contributes to the ongoing efforts of tightly integrating\nquantum accelerators into High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. Tested on a\nZynq RFSoC FPGA at 250 MHz, our hardware implementation is able to complete the\nrearrangement process of a 30$\\times$30 compact target array, derived from a\n50$\\times$50 initial loaded array, in approximately 1.0 $\\mu s$. Compared to a\ncomparable CPU implementation and to state-of-the-art FPGA work, we achieved\nabout 54$\\times$ and 300$\\times$ speedups in the rearrangement analysis time,\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "Inferring the coupling of different atmospheric layers requires observing\nspectral lines sensitive to the atmospheric parameters, particularly the\nmagnetic field vector, at various heights. The best way to tackle this goal is\nto perform multi-line observations simultaneously. For instance, the new\nversion of the Gregor Infrared Spectrograph instrument offers the possibility\nto observe the spectral lines at 8542 and 10830 A simultaneously for the first\ntime. The first spectral window contains the Ca II 8542 A spectral line, while\nthe Si I 10827 A transition and He I 10830 A triplet infrared lines can be\nfound in the second spectral window. As the sensitivity to the atmospheric\nparameters and the height of formation of those transitions is different,\ncombining them can help understand the properties of the solar photosphere and\nchromosphere and how they are magnetically coupled. Traditionally, the analysis\nof the Si I 10827 A transition assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE),\nwhich is not the best approximation to model this transition. Hence, in this\nwork, we examine the potential of performing non-LTE (NLTE) inversions of the\nfull Stokes vector of the Si I 10827 A spectral line. The results indicate that\nwe properly infer the atmospheric parameters through an extended range of\natmospheric layers in comparison with the LTE case (only valid for the spectral\nline wings, i.e., the low photosphere), with no impact on the robustness of the\nsolution and just a minor increase in computational time. Thus, the NLTE\nassumption will help to accurately constrain the photospheric physical\nparameters when performing combined inversions with, e.g., the Ca II 8542 A\nspectral line.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, the nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) on proton\ndiffusivity in oxides were evaluated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\nwith the quantum thermal bath (QTB) based on the Langevin dynamics. We employed\nthe proton diffusion in barium zirconate (BaZrO3) with the cubic perovskite\nstructure as the model system, in which protons migrate by rotation around\nsingle oxide ions and hopping between adjacent oxide ions. MD simulations with\nthe standard classical thermal bath (CTB) and phonon calculations were also\nconducted to verify the conventionally used classical harmonic transition state\ntheory (classical h-TST), in which the transition state theory (TST), the\nharmonic approximation, and the classical approximation are assumed. As a\nresult, the h-TST are reasonable for the proton rotation, while significantly\noverestimate the activation energy and the pre-exponential factor of the jump\nfrequency for the proton hopping. Furthermore, the classical approximation\nmakes the proton jump frequencies close to linear in the Arrhenius plots, which\nshould actually be nonlinear by the NQEs in the temperature range of 500-2000\nK. This suggests the necessity of the treatment beyond the classical h-TST for\naccurate evaluation of the proton diffusivity in oxides even in the\nintermediate temperature range (573-873 K).",

The RGBM model is inherently\nnon-stationary and non-ergodic, leading to complex resource redistribution\ndynamics. By introducing stochastic resetting, which periodically returns the\nsystem to a predetermined state, we examine how this mechanism modifies RGBM\nbehavior. Our analysis uncovers distinct long-term regimes determined by the\ninterplay between the resetting rate, the strength of resource redistribution,\nand standard geometric Brownian motion parameters: the drift and the noise\namplitude. Notably, we identify a critical resetting rate beyond which the\nself-averaging time becomes effectively infinite. In this regime, the first two\nmoments are stationary, indicating a stabilized distribution of an initially\nunstable, mean-repulsive process. We demonstrate that optimal resetting can\neffectively balance growth and redistribution, reducing inequality in the\nresource distribution.

Numerous representative T2I models have emerged and achieved promising\napplication outcomes, such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Imagen, etc. In\npractice, it has become increasingly popular for model developers to\nselectively adopt various pre-trained text encoders and conditional diffusion\nmodels from third-party platforms, integrating them to build customized\n(personalized) T2I models. However, such an adoption approach is vulnerable to\nbackdoor attacks. In this work, we propose a Combinational Backdoor Attack\nagainst Customized T2I models (CBACT2I) targeting this application scenario.\nDifferent from previous backdoor attacks against T2I models, CBACT2I embeds the\nbackdoor into the text encoder and the conditional diffusion model separately.\nThe customized T2I model exhibits backdoor behaviors only when the backdoor\ntext encoder is used in combination with the backdoor conditional diffusion\nmodel. These properties make CBACT2I more stealthy and flexible than prior\nbackdoor attacks against T2I models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of CBACT2I with different backdoor triggers and different\nbackdoor targets on the open-sourced Stable Diffusion model. This work reveals\nthe backdoor vulnerabilities of customized T2I models and urges countermeasures\nto mitigate backdoor threats in this scenario.",

A typical demonstration is\nthat V-L models often produce biased predictions against specific groups of\npeople, significantly undermining their real-world applicability. Existing\napproaches endeavor to mitigate the social bias problem in V-L models by\nremoving biased attribute information from model embeddings. However, after our\nrevisiting of these methods, we find that their bias removal is frequently\naccompanied by greatly compromised V-L alignment capabilities. We then reveal\nthat this performance degradation stems from the unbalanced debiasing in image\nand text embeddings. To address this issue, we propose a novel V-L debiasing\nframework to align image and text biases followed by removing them from both\nmodalities. By doing so, our method achieves multi-modal bias mitigation while\nmaintaining the V-L alignment in the debiased embeddings.

The `wells' in the\nproblem are identical discs with Neumann boundary conditions, so we study the\nmagnetic Neumann Laplacian in the complement of a set of discs. We provide a\nreduction method to an interaction matrix, which works for a general\nconfiguration of obstacles. When there are two discs, we deduce an asymptotic\nformula for the spectral gap. When the discs are placed along a regular\nlattice, we derive an effective operator which gives rise to the famous\nHarper's equation. Main challenges in this problem compared to recent results\non magnetic tunneling are the fact that one-well ground states have non-trivial\nangular momentum which depends on the semiclassical parameter, and the\nexistence of eigenvalue crossings.",

Multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) offer a promising solution to these challenges.\nHowever, existing MLLMs have limitations in fully leveraging the rich,\nhierarchical information embedded in 3D medical images. Inspired by clinical\npractice, where radiologists focus on both 3D spatial structure and 2D planar\ncontent, we propose Med-2E3, a novel MLLM for 3D medical image analysis that\nintegrates 3D and 2D encoders. To aggregate 2D features more effectively, we\ndesign a Text-Guided Inter-Slice (TG-IS) scoring module, which scores the\nattention of each 2D slice based on slice contents and task instructions. To\nthe best of our knowledge, Med-2E3 is the first MLLM to integrate both 3D and\n2D features for 3D medical image analysis. Experiments on a large-scale,\nopen-source 3D medical multimodal benchmark demonstrate that Med-2E3 exhibits\ntask-specific attention distribution and significantly outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art models, with a 14% improvement in report generation and a 5%\ngain in medical visual question answering (VQA), highlighting the model's\npotential in addressing complex multimodal clinical tasks.

    "abstract": "Large language models are increasingly becoming a cornerstone technology in\nartificial intelligence, the sciences, and society as a whole, yet the optimal\nstrategies for dataset composition and filtering remain largely elusive. Many\nof the top-performing models lack transparency in their dataset curation and\nmodel development processes, posing an obstacle to the development of fully\nopen language models. In this paper, we identify three core data-related\nchallenges that must be addressed to advance open-source language models. These\ninclude (1) transparency in model development, including the data curation\nprocess, (2) access to large quantities of high-quality data, and (3)\navailability of artifacts and metadata for dataset curation and analysis. To\naddress these challenges, we release RedPajama-V1, an open reproduction of the\nLLaMA training dataset. In addition, we release RedPajama-V2, a massive\nweb-only dataset consisting of raw, unfiltered text data together with quality\nsignals and metadata. Together, the RedPajama datasets comprise over 100\ntrillion tokens spanning multiple domains and with their quality signals\nfacilitate the filtering of data, aiming to inspire the development of numerous\nnew datasets. To date, these datasets have already been used in the training of\nstrong language models used in production, such as Snowflake Arctic,\nSalesforce's XGen and AI2's OLMo. To provide insight into the quality of\nRedPajama, we present a series of analyses and ablation studies with\ndecoder-only language models with up to 1.6B parameters.

Our previous\nwork demonstrated that ultrasound-induced shape instabilities in microbubbles\ngenerate periodic jets capable of puncturing cells and enabling targeted drug\ndelivery (Cattaneo et al., 2024). This study investigates the physics of these\ninstabilities in a controlled setup involving individual micrometric air\nbubbles on rigid substrates. Using a dual-view imaging system combining visible\nlight and phase-contrast x-ray radiation, we capture high-speed,\nhigh-resolution recordings on bubble shape dynamics. Four distinct response\nregimes are identified: spherical oscillations, harmonic meniscus waves,\nhalf-harmonic axisymmetric shape mode, and mixed shape mode. The half-harmonic\nmodes arise from Faraday instability, with pressure thresholds aligning well\nwith classical interface stability theory adapted for rigid substrates.\nSimulations using a 3D boundary element method closely match experimental\nobservations, validating this approach for predicting bubble dynamics. The\nshape mode spectrum shows degeneracy and a continuous range of mode degrees,\nconsistent with our theoretical predictions. Shape modes achieve higher\namplitudes than volumetric modes, making them more effective at converting\nacoustic energy into kinetic energy. These modes generate substrate-directed\njets when a lobe folds inward with sufficient acceleration. This process recurs\nwith each cycle of the shape mode and has the potential to damage the\nsubstrate. These jets represent a new class of bubble jets, distinct from\nclassical single inertial jets that form under high-pressure gradients during\nbubble collapse, as they are cyclic, driven by an interfacial instability, and\noccur at much lower acoustic intensities.",

    "abstract": "The fast evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious viruses poses a grand\nchallenge to the rapid response in terms of viral tracking, diagnostics, and\ndesign and manufacture of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines, which are\nboth time-consuming and costly. This underscores the need for efficient\ncomputational approaches. Recent advancements, like topological deep learning\n(TDL), have introduced powerful tools for forecasting emerging dominant\nvariants, yet they require deep mutational scanning (DMS) of viral surface\nproteins and associated three-dimensional (3D) protein-protein interaction\n(PPI) complex structures. We propose an AlphaFold 3 (AF3)-assisted multi-task\ntopological Laplacian (MT-TopLap) strategy to address this need. MT-TopLap\ncombines deep learning with topological data analysis (TDA) models, such as\npersistent Laplacians (PL) to extract detailed topological and geometric\ncharacteristics of PPIs, thereby enhancing the prediction of DMS and binding\nfree energy (BFE) changes upon virus mutations. Validation with four\nexperimental DMS datasets of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and\nthe human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) complexes indicates that our\nAF3 assisted MT-TopLap strategy maintains robust performance, with only an\naverage 1.1% decrease in Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) and an average\n9.3% increase in root mean square errors (RMSE), compared with the use of\nexperimental structures. Additionally, AF3-assisted MT-TopLap achieved a PCC of\n0.81 when tested with a SARS-CoV-2 HK.3 variant DMS dataset, confirming its\ncapability to accurately predict BFE changes and adapt to new experimental\ndata, thereby showcasing its potential for rapid and effective response to fast\nviral evolution.",

The lifespan\nfor an enterprise that has been founded before the first wave of the panel is\neither left truncated, when the enterprise is contained in the panel, or\nmissing, when it already closed down before the first wave. Marginalizing the\nlikelihood to that part of the enterprise history after the first wave\ncontributes to the aim of a closed-form estimate and standard error. Invariance\nunder the foundation distribution is achived by conditioning on observability\nof the enterprises. The conditional marginal likelihood can be written as a\nfunction of a martingale. The later arises when calculating the compensator,\nwith respect some filtration, of a process that counts the closures. The\nestimator itself can then also be written as a martingale transform and\nconsistency as well as asymptotic normality are easily proven.

    "abstract": "A retrieval data structure stores a static function f : S -> {0,1}^r . For\nall x in S, it returns the r-bit value f(x), while for other inputs it may\nreturn an arbitrary result. The structure cannot answer membership queries, so\nit does not have to encode S. The information theoretic space lower bound for\narbitrary inputs is r|S| bits. Retrieval data structures have widespread\napplications. They can be used as an approximate membership filter for S by\nstoring fingerprints of the keys in S, where they are faster and more space\nefficient than Bloom filters. They can also be used as a basic building block\nof succinct data structures like perfect hash functions.\n  Bumped Ribbon Retrieval (BuRR) [Dillinger et al., SEA'22] is a recently\ndeveloped retrieval data structure that is fast to construct with a space\noverhead of less than 1%. The idea is to solve a nearly diagonal system of\nlinear equations to determine a matrix that, multiplied with the hash of each\nkey, gives the desired output values. During solving, BuRR might bump lines of\nthe equation system to another layer of the same data structure. While the\npaper describes a simple parallel construction based on bumping the keys on\nthread boundaries, it does not give an implementation. In this brief\nannouncement, we now fill this gap.\n  Our parallel implementation is transparent to the queries. It achieves a\nspeedup of 14 on 32 cores for 8-bit filters. The additional space overhead is\n105 bytes per thread, or 105 slots. This matches 0.0007% of the total space\nconsumption when constructing with 1 billion input keys. A large portion of the\nconstruction time is spent on parallel sorting.",

External time-varying voltage exerting on the\ntwo-terminal ionic tunneling junction mimics the stimulation of neurons from\nthe outside. By deriving the quantum Langevin equation from quantum mechanics,\nthe ion channel current is obtained by the quantum tunneling of ions controlled\nby the time-varying voltage. The time-varying voltage induces an effective\nmagnetic flux which causes quantum coherence in ion tunnelings and leads to\nsideband effects in the ion channel current dynamics. The sideband effects in\nthe ionic current dynamics manifest a multi-crossing hysteresis in the I-V\ncurve, which is the memory dynamics responding to the variation of the external\nvoltage. Such memory dynamics is defined as the active quantum memory with\nrespect to the time-varying stimuli. We can quantitatively describe how active\nquantum memory is generated and changed. We find that the number of the\nnon-zero cross points in the I-V curve hysteresis and the oscillation of the\ndifferential conductance are the characteristics for quantitatively describing\nthe active quantum memory.

The paper combines multiple methods to explain the behaviour of the\nhyperparameters of a wide-kernel convolutional neural network and how to set\nthem. Since guidance already exists for generic hyperparameters like minibatch\nsize, we focus on how to set architecture-specific hyperparameters such as the\nwidth of the convolutional kernels, a topic which might otherwise be obscure.\nWe reflect different data properties by fusing information from seven different\nbenchmark datasets, and our results show that the kernel size in the first\nlayer in particular is sensitive to changes in the data. Looking deeper, we use\nmanipulated copies of one dataset in an attempt to spot why the kernel size\nsometimes needs to change. The relevance of sampling rate is studied by using\ndifferent levels of resampling, and spectral content is studied by increasingly\nfiltering out high frequencies. We find that, contrary to speculation in\nearlier work, high-frequency noise is not the main reason why a wide kernel is\npreferable to a narrow kernel.

Prior knowledge of customer\ninterruption cost (CIC) and load restoration behaviors, particularly cold load\npickup (CLPU), is essential for effective decision-making. However, both CIC\nand CLPU are reciprocally influenced by the realized customer interruption\nduration (CID), making them decision-dependent and challenging to model,\nespecially given the limited understanding of their underlying physical\nmechanisms. This paper proposes a novel and tractable modeling approach to\ncapture the varying patterns of CIC and CLPU with CID - patterns derived from\ndata that reflect observable surface - level correlations rather than\nunderlying mechanisms - thereby enabling practical surrogate modeling of these\ndecision-dependent factors. Specifically, quadratic functions are employed to\nmodel the increasing rate of CIC with respect to CID according to data fitting\nresults. For CLPU, several defining characteristics are extracted and modeled\nin a piecewise linear form relative to CID, and the actual restored load\naccounting for CLPU is subsequently reconstructed.

To address these\nlimitations, physical neural networks (PNNs), which use physical substrates for\ncomputation, have gained increasing attention. However, developing effective\ntraining methods for PNNs remains a significant challenge. Current approaches,\nregardless of offline and online training, suffer from significant accuracy\nloss. Offline training is hindered by imprecise modeling, while online training\nyields device-specific models that can't be transferred to other devices due to\nmanufacturing variances. Both methods face challenges from perturbations after\ndeployment, such as thermal drift or alignment errors, which make trained\nmodels invalid and require retraining.

Its peculiar chemical composition, proximity and absence\nof reddening makes it an interesting case-study of Pop II stars. Thanks to\nrecent observational efforts, we now have precise interferometric and\nspectroscopic constraints, as well as revised astrometric parallaxes from the\nGaia mission. Aims. We aim at determining the age of HD140283 with these\nlastest constraints, as well as quantifying the impact of systematics from\nphysical inaccuracies in the stellar evolution models. Methods. Using recent\nspectroscopic abundances from the literature, including 3D non-LTE values for\nC, O, and Fe, we compute opacity tables specific to HD140283. We then use them\nin grids of stellar evolution models coupled to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo tool\nto determine the age of HD140283. Results. With our tailored models we find an\nage of 12.3Gy. Using a solar-scaled mixture instead results in an age value of\n14Gy, in tension with the age of the universe ($13.77\\pm0.06$Gy). We also find\nthat reducing the mixing length parameter from its solar calibrated value will\nlead to an even lower age, in agreement with other recent studies. However, we\nfind no direct evidence to favour a lower mixing length parameter value from\nour modelling. Conclusions. Taking into account the specific elemental\nabundances is crucial for the modelling of HD140283, as it leads to significant\ndifferences in the inferred age. However, this effect is degenerate with a\nlowering of the mixing length parameter. In this respect, asteroseismic\nconstraints might play a key role in accurately deriving the mass of HD140283,\ntherefore strongly constraining its age.",

The doping of metallic elements\nat grain boundaries can significantly influence the stability, strength, and\nmechanical properties of these materials; however, studies on solute\nsegregation effects in Y-based alloys remain scarce. To address this gap, we\nemploys first-principles calculations to systematically examine the effects of\ndoping with 34 metallic elements on the properties of a highly symmetric twin\ngrain boundary in yttrium. All solute elements exhibit a tendency to segregate\nto regions near the grain boundary, driven by segregation energy.energy\nbarriers influence these elements to prefer segregation positions farther from\nthe grain boundary line. the strengthening energy calculations reveal that all\ndopant elements enhance grain boundary strength when located near the boundary.\nFor grain boundary energy and solubility trends, elements within the same\ntransition metal group across different periods display consistent behaviors.\nAnd considering grain boundary energy effects, we identify 11 elements (Al, Zn,\nRh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Sn, Ir, Pt, Au, Hg) that preferentially segregate near the\ngrain boundary, where they contribute to grain boundary strengthening and\nenhanced stability. By decomposing the strengthening energy into mechanical,\nchemical, and vacancy formation components, chemical contribution is the\nprimary factor in strengthening, while the mechanical contribution of\ntransition metals correlates with changes in the Voronoi volume and relative\natomic radius of the solute. The density of states analysis indicates that\nincreased grain boundary stability arises mainly from hybridization between\nsolute d orbitals and yttrium, leading to more stable electronic states.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their message passing framework that\nleverages both structural and feature information, have become a standard\nmethod for solving graph-based machine learning problems. However, these\napproaches still struggle to generalise well beyond datasets that exhibit\nstrong homophily, where nodes of the same class tend to connect. This\nlimitation has led to the development of complex neural architectures that pose\nchallenges in terms of efficiency and scalability. In response to these\nlimitations, we focus on simpler and more scalable approaches and introduce\nGraph-aware Logistic Regression (GLR), a non-neural model designed for node\nclassification tasks. Unlike traditional graph algorithms that use only a\nfraction of the information accessible to GNNs, our proposed model\nsimultaneously leverages both node features and the relationships between\nentities. However instead of relying on message passing, our approach encodes\neach node's relationships as an additional feature vector, which is then\ncombined with the node's self attributes. Extensive experimental results,\nconducted within a rigorous evaluation framework, show that our proposed GLR\napproach outperforms both foundational and sophisticated state-of-the-art GNN\nmodels in node classification tasks. Going beyond the traditional limited\nbenchmarks, our experiments indicate that GLR increases generalisation ability\nwhile reaching performance gains in computation time up to two orders of\nmagnitude compared to it best neural competitor.",

Beamforming the measured signals offers a promising alternative\nto bypass the cumbersome fitting procedure and to determine the longitudinal\nprofile directly. Finite aperture effects in beamforming hamper the resolution\nwith which this profile can be determined. We present a comprehensive\ninvestigation of the beamforming resolution in radiometric observations of air\nshowers. There are two, principally different, approaches possible in\nair-shower beamforming, one where the total beamforming intensity is determined\nand an alternative where the beamforming trace is cross-correlated with a known\nresponse function. The effects due to a finite aperture (size of antenna array\nand bandwidth) are large for both approaches. We argue that it is possible to\ncorrect for the aperture corrections using an unfolding procedure. We give an\nexplicit expression for the folding function, the kernel. Being able to\ncalculate the folding function allows for unfolding the finite aperture effects\nfrom the data. We show that, in a model-to-model comparison, this allows for an\naccurate reconstruction of the current profile as the shower develops in the\natmosphere.

To overcome this limitation, a sophisticated approach is\nproposed that preserves the interpretability advantages of sPCA while\nsignificantly enhancing its source extraction capabilities.

Since the ubiquitous categorical data naturally lack a well-defined\nmetric space such as the Euclidean distance space of numerical data, the\ndistribution of categorical data is usually under-represented, and thus\nvaluable information can be easily twisted in clustering. This paper,\ntherefore, introduces a novel order distance metric learning approach to\nintuitively represent categorical attribute values by learning their optimal\norder relationship and quantifying their distance in a line similar to that of\nthe numerical attributes. Since subjectively created qualitative categorical\nvalues involve ambiguity and fuzziness, the order distance metric is learned in\nthe context of clustering. Accordingly, a new joint learning paradigm is\ndeveloped to alternatively perform clustering and order distance metric\nlearning with low time complexity and a guarantee of convergence. Due to the\nclustering-friendly order learning mechanism and the homogeneous ordinal nature\nof the order distance and Euclidean distance, the proposed method achieves\nsuperior clustering accuracy on categorical and mixed datasets. More\nimportantly, the learned order distance metric greatly reduces the difficulty\nof understanding and managing the non-intuitive categorical data.

    "abstract": "The quality of numerical computations can be measured through their forward\nerror, for which finding good error bounds is challenging in general. For\nseveral algorithms and using stochastic rounding (SR), probabilistic analysis\nhas been shown to be an effective alternative for obtaining tight error bounds.\nThis analysis considers the distribution of errors and evaluates the\nalgorithm's performance on average. Using martingales and the Azuma-Hoeffding\ninequality, it provides error bounds that are valid with a certain probability\nand in O($\\sqrt$nu) instead of deterministic worst-case bounds in O(nu), where\nn is the number of operations and u is the unit roundoff. In this paper, we\npresent a general method that automatically constructs a martingale for any\ncomputation scheme with multi-linear errors based on additions, subtractions,\nand multiplications. We apply this generalization to algorithms previously\nstudied with SR, such as pairwise summation and the Horner algorithm, and prove\nequivalent results. We also analyze a previously unstudied algorithm, Karatsuba\npolynomial multiplication, which illustrates that the method can handle reused\nintermediate computations.",

However, due to the inherent\ncommunication overhead and synchronization delays in traditional model\nparallelism methods, seamless parallel training cannot be achieved, which, to\nsome extent, affects overall training efficiency. To address this issue, we\npresent PPLL (Pipeline Parallelism based on Local Learning), a novel framework\nthat leverages local learning algorithms to enable effective parallel training\nacross multiple GPUs. PPLL divides the model into several distinct blocks, each\nallocated to a separate GPU. By utilizing queues to manage data transfers\nbetween GPUs, PPLL ensures seamless cross-GPU communication, allowing multiple\nblocks to execute forward and backward passes in a pipelined manner. This\ndesign minimizes idle times and prevents bottlenecks typically caused by\nsequential gradient updates, thereby accelerating the overall training process.\nWe validate PPLL through extensive experiments using ResNet and Vision\nTransformer (ViT) architectures on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and STL-10 datasets. Our\nresults demonstrate that PPLL significantly enhances the training speed of the\nlocal learning method while achieving comparable or even superior training\nspeed to traditional pipeline parallelism (PP) without sacrificing model\nperformance. In a 4-GPU training setup, PPLL accelerated local learning\ntraining on ViT and ResNet by 162% and 33%, respectively, achieving 1.25x and\n0.85x the speed of traditional pipeline parallelism.",

In\ncomparison to previous works of the author which examined the 6-vertex, and\n20-vertex, models, the 4-vertex model exhibits different characteristics,\nranging from L-operators expressed in terms of projectors and Pauli matrices to\nalgebraic and combinatorial properties, including Poisson structure and boxed\nplane partitions. With far fewer computations with an L-operator provided for\nthe 4-vertex model by Bogoliubov in 2007, in comparison to those for\nL-operators of the 6, and 20, vertex models, from lower order expansions of the\ntransfer matrix we derive a system of relations from the structure of operators\nthat can be leveraged for studying characteristics of the higher-spin XXX chain\nin the weak finite volume limit. In comparison to quantum inverse scattering\nmethods for the 6, and 20, vertex models which can be used to further study\nintegrability, and exact solvability, an adaptation of such an approach for the\n4-vertex model can be used to approximate, asymptotically in the weak finite\nvolume limit, sixteen brackets which generate the Poisson structure. From\nexplicit relations for operators of the 4-vertex transfer matrix, we conclude\nby discussing corresponding aspects of the Yang-Baxter algebra, which is\nclosely related to the operators obtained from products of L-operators for\napproximating the transfer, and quantum monodromy, matrices. The structure of\ncomputations from L-operators of the 4-vertex model directly transfers to\nL-operators of the higher-spin XXX chain, revealing a similar structure of\nanother Yang-Baxter algebra of interest.",

This agent explores its universe and learns concepts of\nobjects/situations and of its own actions in a one-shot manner. While\nobject/situation concepts are unary, action concepts are triples made up of an\ninitial situation, a motor activity, and an outcome. They embody the agent's\nknowledge of its universe's action laws. Both kinds of concepts have different\ndegrees of generality. To make decisions the agent queries its semantic memory\nfor the expected outcomes of envisaged actions and chooses the action to take\non the basis of these predictions. Our experiments show that the agent handles\nnew situations by appealing to previously learned general concepts and rapidly\nmodifies its concepts to adapt to environment changes.",

However, challenges such as the scarcity of\ncomprehensive datasets and the complexity of contextual dependencies across\ndialogue turns hinder progress. This paper presents two novel approaches\nleveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance scalability and reduce\nlatency in production dialogue systems. First, we introduce Symbol Tuning,\nwhich simplifies intent labels to reduce task complexity and improve\nperformance in multi-turn dialogues. Second, we propose C-LARA\n(Consistency-aware, Linguistics Adaptive Retrieval Augmentation), a framework\nthat employs LLMs for data augmentation and pseudo-labeling to generate\nsynthetic multi-turn dialogues. These enriched datasets are used to fine-tune a\nsmall, efficient model suitable for deployment. Experiments conducted on\nmultilingual dialogue datasets demonstrate significant improvements in\nclassification accuracy and resource efficiency.

The current deep learning-based\ndetectors encounter challenges in distinguishing fine-grained SAR airplanes\nagainst complex backgrounds. To address it, we propose a novel physics-guided\ndetector (PGD) learning paradigm for SAR airplanes that comprehensively\ninvestigate their discreteness and variability to improve the detection\nperformance. It is a general learning paradigm that can be extended to\ndifferent existing deep learning-based detectors with \"backbone-neck-head\"\narchitectures. The main contributions of PGD include the physics-guided\nself-supervised learning, feature enhancement, and instance perception, denoted\nas PGSSL, PGFE, and PGIP, respectively. PGSSL aims to construct a\nself-supervised learning task based on a wide range of SAR airplane targets\nthat encodes the prior knowledge of various discrete structure distributions\ninto the embedded space. Then, PGFE enhances the multi-scale feature\nrepresentation of a detector, guided by the physics-aware information learned\nfrom PGSSL. PGIP is constructed at the detection head to learn the refined and\ndominant scattering point of each SAR airplane instance, thus alleviating the\ninterference from the complex background. We propose two implementations,\ndenoted as PGD and PGD-Lite, and apply them to various existing detectors with\ndifferent backbones and detection heads. The experiments demonstrate the\nflexibility and effectiveness of the proposed PGD, which can improve existing\ndetectors on SAR airplane detection with fine-grained classification task (an\nimprovement of 3.1\\% mAP most), and achieve the state-of-the-art performance\n(90.7\\% mAP) on SAR-AIRcraft-1.0 dataset.

    "abstract": "The objective of this work is to manipulate visual timelines (e.g. a video)\nthrough natural language instructions, making complex timeline editing tasks\naccessible to non-expert or potentially even disabled users. We call this task\nInstructed visual assembly. This task is challenging as it requires (i)\nidentifying relevant visual content in the input timeline as well as retrieving\nrelevant visual content in a given input (video) collection, (ii) understanding\nthe input natural language instruction, and (iii) performing the desired edits\nof the input visual timeline to produce an output timeline. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Timeline Assembler, a generative model trained to\nperform instructed visual assembly tasks. The contributions of this work are\nthree-fold. First, we develop a large multimodal language model, which is\ndesigned to process visual content, compactly represent timelines and\naccurately interpret timeline editing instructions. Second, we introduce a\nnovel method for automatically generating datasets for visual assembly tasks,\nenabling efficient training of our model without the need for human-labeled\ndata. Third, we validate our approach by creating two novel datasets for image\nand video assembly, demonstrating that the Timeline Assembler substantially\noutperforms established baseline models, including the recent GPT-4o, in\naccurately executing complex assembly instructions across various real-world\ninspired scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents, for the first time, the soft planar vertical take-off\nand landing (Soft-PVTOL) aircraft. This concept captures the soft aerial\nvehicle's fundamental dynamics with a minimum number of states and inputs but\nretains the main features to consider when designing control laws. Unlike\nconventional PVTOL and multi-rotors, where altering position inevitably impacts\norientation due to their underactuated design, the Soft-PVTOL offers the unique\nadvantage of separating these dynamics, opening doors to unparalleled\nmaneuverability and precision. We demonstrate that the Soft-PVTOL can be\nmodeled using the Euler-Lagrange equations by assuming a constant curvature\nmodel in the aerial robot's arms. Such a mathematical model is presented in\ndetail and can be extended to several constant curvature segments in each\nSoft-PVTOL arm. Moreover, we design a passivity-based control law that exploits\nthe flexibility of the robot's arms.

    "abstract": "The Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics has global Family flavor\nsymmetries corresponding to the 3 families in the Standard Model. It has been\nshown that the breaking of these symmetries at low energy produces Dark Energy\nwhich is the dominant component of the energy density of the Universe. It has\nalso been shown that this model of Dark Energy not only explains the\naccelerated expansion of the universe but has additional observational\nconsequences and makes verifiable predictions. This model allows a space-time\ndependent Dark Energy as indicated by recent observations. Further, the\ncollapse of space dependent Dark Energy configurations leads to the formation\nof Dark Energy Black Holes resulting in verifiable predictions. We examine the\nimplications of these symmetries at high energies and in the Early Universe. We\nconsider what might happen if these global symmetries get gauged and that the\nglobal symmetries today are just a consequence of the gauge fields acquiring a\nconstant vacuum expectation value below some energy scale v. Since, we have not\nyet seen signatures of such gauge fields at any of our particle accelerators,\nthis would imply that v is greater than the electroweak scale. In the early\nUniverse, when these gauge fields would be dynamical, the Higgs would not yet\nhave acquired a non-zero vacuum expectation value and all Standard Model\nparticles would be massless. The gauging of these global symmetries is\ndesirable from a high energy and quantum gravity perspective. The chiral\ndynamics has a natural interpretation in terms of D Branes and our\n4-dimensional Universe embedded in higher dimensions. Anomaly cancellation in\nthis scenario results from the sum of the cubic terms vanishing. Finally, the\nanalysis in this article can provide an explanation for one of the long\nstanding mysteries of the natural world: the matter - antimatter asymmetry\nobserved in our Universe.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Speech is an integral component of human communication,\nrequiring the coordinated efforts of various organs to produce sound (Titze &\nAlipour, 2006). The glottis region, a key player in voice production, assumes a\ncrucial role in this intricate process. As air, emanating from the lungs in a\nconfined space, interacts with the vocal folds (VFs) within the human body, it\ngives rise to the creation of voice (Alipour & Vigmostad, 2012). Understanding\nthe mechanical intricacies of this process is very important. Studying VFs in\nvivo situations is hard work. However, the orientation, shape and size of VFs\nfibers have been extracted with synchrotron X-ray microtomography. (Bailly et\nal., 2018) The investigation of mechanical properties of both human and animal\nVFs has been carried out through various methodologies in the literature. The\nmechanical properties of VFs have been studied using the uniaxial extension\ntest (Alipour & Vigmostad, 2012) assuming a linear behavior, while the\nnonlinearity and anisotropy of VFs has been determined using a multiscale\nmethod as in Miri et al. (2013). Pipette aspiration has also been used to\nextract in vivo elastic properties of VFs (Scheible et al., 2023). Mechanical\nbehavior of VFs layers in tension, compression and shear has been studied.\n(Cochereau et al., 2020). Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations provide\na valuable tool to gain a deeper understanding of voice production (Ghorbani et\nal. 2022). These simulations allow us to model the dynamic interplay between\nthe VFs and air. Our research focuses on investigating the mechanical\nproperties of canine vocal folds and utilizing these findings in an FSI\nsimulation. Through this simulation, we aim to unravel how these mechanical\nproperties affect voice production.Methods To investigate the mechanical\nproperties of canine VFs, an in vitro study was conducted involving 6\nmixedbreed dogs. The samples were harvested from canine cadavers euthanized for\nreasons unrelated to this study. In the following, the VFs were harvested and\ntested upon 3-4 hours post-animal sacrifice. Experimental trials were carried\nout using the STM-1 device (SANTAM Co.), equipped with a 100 kg load cell.\nSeven uniaxial tensile tests were done on each sample, with displacement rates\nof 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 120 mm/min. The very slow rate of 1 mm/min was\nchosen to assess only elastic properties eliminating viscosity effects. Various\nhyperelastic models were used to fit the experimental data. Subsequently, for\neach model, both the mean and standard deviation (SD) were determined for the\nhyperelastic model parameters and their residuals. For FSI analysis we used a\nsimplified laryngeal model as a hollow cylinder with a diameter of 50 mm and a\nthickness of 3 mm. The overall length of the larynx was set at 100 mm. The VFs\nwere modeled as a circular disc with a small elliptical fissure in the midst of\nthe cylinder section. Boundary conditions were established based on pressure\ndifferentials, with the inlet gauge pressure set at 1200 Pa and the relative\npressure at the outlet set to 0. To account for the turbulent nature of airflow\nwithin the larynx, we employed the K-epsilon method to solve the motion\ndifferential equations in a two-way fluid-structure interaction simulation\nusing ANSYS FLUENT 2021. This approach enabled us to investigate how the\nacquired mechanical properties of canine vocal folds affect the FSI simulations\nduring phonation, resulting in a more comprehensive understanding of their\nimpact. To determine the vibrational frequency of VFs, we calculated the time\nit took to reach maximum displacement and then quadrupled this value to obtain\nthe period of vibration.",

    "abstract": "We study the evolution of the total binding energy (TBE) and pairing energy\nof Pb, Hg and Ar isotopes, as a function of the nuclear deformation. As for the\nnuclear model, we exploit a deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in\nthe continuum (DRHBc), and a deformed Skyrme Hartree-Fock plus BCS model. It is\nfound that the dependence of pairing energy on the deformation is strongly\ncorrelated to that of the mean field energy, which is obtained by subtracting\nthe pairing energy from the TBE; in other words, the energy minimum\ncharacterized by a large negative mean field energy has a smaller negative\npairing energy or, equivalently, a smaller positive pairing gap, while a\nstronger pairing energy is found in the region away from the minimum of the\ntotal energy. Consequently, the two energies show an anti-symmetric feature in\ntheir deformation dependence, although the energy scales are very different.\nMoreover, since the pairing energy has a negative sign with respect to to the\npairing gap, the evolution of mean field energy follows closely that of the\npairing gap. This implies that the pairing energy (or pairing gap) and the mean\nfield energy talk to each other and work together along the potential energy\ncurve to determine the energy minimum and/or the local minimum.",

However, because cataract patients may also suffer from other\nblinding eye diseases, ophthalmologists must diagnose them before surgery. The\ncloudy lens of cataract patients forms a hazy degeneration in the fundus\nimages, making it challenging to observe the patient's fundus vessels, which\nbrings difficulties to the diagnosis process. To address this issue, this paper\nestablishes a new cataract image restoration method named Catintell. It\ncontains a cataract image synthesizing model, Catintell-Syn, and a restoration\nmodel, Catintell-Res. Catintell-Syn uses GAN architecture with fully\nunsupervised data to generate paired cataract-like images with realistic style\nand texture rather than the conventional Gaussian degradation algorithm.\nMeanwhile, Catintell-Res is an image restoration network that can improve the\nquality of real cataract fundus images using the knowledge learned from\nsynthetic cataract images. Extensive experiments show that Catintell-Res\noutperforms other cataract image restoration methods in PSNR with 39.03 and\nSSIM with 0.9476. Furthermore, the universal restoration ability that\nCatintell-Res gained from unpaired cataract images can process cataract images\nfrom various datasets.

We\ncombined data from integral field spectroscopy with VLT/MUSE and\nhigh-resolution spectra from VLT/X-shooter to map the optical emission line\nratios in both jet lobes. We carried out a diagnostic analysis of these ratios\nto compare the density, electron temperature, and ionisation fraction within\nboth lobes. The mass accretion rate was derived from the emission lines at the\nsource and compared with the mass outflow rate derived for both lobes, using\nthe estimated densities and measured [O I]6300 and [S II ]6731 luminosities.\nThe blue-shifted jet exhibits a significantly higher electron temperature and\nmoderately higher ionisation fraction than the red-shifted jet. In contrast to\nprevious studies, we also estimated higher densities in the blue-shifted jet by\na factor of ~2. These asymmetries are traced to within 160 au of the source in\nthe line ratio maps. We estimate the mass accretion rate onto the central star\nand compare this with estimates of the mass outflow rates through each side of\nthe jet. The emission line maps and diagnostic results suggest that the jet\nasymmetries originate close to the source and are likely to be intrinsic to the\njet.

The spectrum predictor first predicts the noisy amplitude\nand phase spectra from the input noisy mel-spectrogram, and subsequently the\nenhancement module recovers the clean amplitude and phase spectrum from noisy\nones. Finally, clean speech waveforms are reconstructed through inverse\nshort-time Fourier transform (iSTFT). All operations are performed at the\nframe-level spectral domain, with the APNet vocoder and MP-SENet speech\nenhancement model used as the backbones for the two components, respectively.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed neural denoising vocoder\nachieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing neural vocoders on\nthe VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset. Additionally, despite the lack of phase\ninformation and partial amplitude information in the input mel-spectrogram, the\nproposed neural denoising vocoder still achieves comparable performance with\nthe serveral advanced speech enhancement methods.",

Pre-training based methods effectively tackle the\nproblem by pre-training a feature extractor and then performing class\nprediction via a cosine classifier with mean-based prototypes. Nevertheless,\ndue to the data scarcity, the mean-based prototypes are usually biased. In this\npaper, we attempt to diminish the prototype bias by regarding it as a prototype\noptimization problem. To this end, we propose a novel prototype optimization\nframework to rectify prototypes, i.e., introducing a meta-optimizer to optimize\nprototypes. Although the existing meta-optimizers can also be adapted to our\nframework, they all overlook a crucial gradient bias issue, i.e., the\nmean-based gradient estimation is also biased on sparse data. To address this\nissue, in this paper, we regard the gradient and its flow as meta-knowledge and\nthen propose a novel Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)-based\nmeta-optimizer to optimize prototypes, called MetaNODE. Although MetaNODE has\nshown superior performance, it suffers from a huge computational burden. To\nfurther improve its computation efficiency, we conduct a detailed analysis on\nMetaNODE and then design an effective and efficient MetaNODE extension version\n(called E2MetaNODE). It consists of two novel modules: E2GradNet and E2Solver,\nwhich aim to estimate accurate gradient flows and solve optimal prototypes in\nan effective and efficient manner, respectively.

Additionally,\nwe propose a method of concatenating previous chat history with just\nsingle-turn user queries in the input text, allowing the model to understand\nthe overall conversation context better. Our proposed model significantly\nimproves the F1 score for both user intent and musical attribute\nclassification, and surpasses the zero-shot and few-shot performance of the\npretrained Llama 3 model.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the low Reynolds number hydrodynamics of a spherical swimmer\nwith a predominantly hydrophobic surface, except for a hydrophilic active\npatch. This active patch covers a portion of the surface and exhibits chiral\nactivity that varies as a function of $\\theta$ and $\\phi$. Our study considers\ntwo types of active patches: (i) a symmetric active patch (independent of\n$\\phi$) and (ii) an arbitrary active patch (depends on both $\\theta$ and\n$\\phi$). The swimming velocity, rotation rate, and flow field of the swimmer\nare calculated analytically. The objective of this work is to find the optimal\nconfigurations for both patch models to maximize the swimmer's velocity and\nefficiency. Interestingly, the maximum velocity can be controlled by adjusting\nthe hydrophobicity, patch configuration, and strength of the surface activity.\nWe find that for the symmetric patch model, the swimmer's velocity is $U_{SP} =\n1.414 U_s$, where $U_s$ is the velocity of a swimmer whose surface is fully\ncovered with chiral activity as a reference. For the arbitrary patch model, the\nvelocity is $U_{AP} = 1.45 U_s$, which is higher than that of the symmetric\npatch model. Our results indicate that swimmers with low hydrophobicity exhibit\nefficient swimming characteristics. Additionally, due to the incomplete\ncoverage of the active patch, the Stokeslet and Rotlet terms appear in the flow\nfield generated by the swimmer, which is a deviation compared to the case of a\nswimmer whose surface is fully covered with chiral activity. This study\nprovides insights useful for designing synthetic active particles, which can be\napplied, for example, in targeted drug delivery, chemotaxis, and phototaxis.",

Considering\nbroad emission line regions (BLRs) lying into central accretion disk related to\naccreted materials onto central black hole in TDEs, mass evolution\n$M_{BLRs}(t)$ of central BLRs can be determined by the maximum mass\n$M_{BLRs,0}$ of central BLRs minus the corresponding accreted mass in a TDE.\nMeanwhile, through the simple linear dependence of Broad Balmer emission line\nluminosity on mass of BLRs, the mass evolution $M_{BLRs}(t)$ of central BLRs\ncan be applied to describe the observed $L_{H\\alpha}(t)$. Although the proposed\nmodel is oversimplified with only one free model parameter $M_{BLRs,0}$, the\nmodel with $M_{BLRs,0}\\sim0.02{\\rm M_\\odot}$ can be applied to well describe\nthe observed $L_{H\\alpha}(t)$ in the TDE ASASSN-14li.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an event-triggered parameterized control method using a\ncontrol Lyapunov function approach for discrete time linear systems with\nexternal disturbances. In this control method, each control input to the plant\nis a linear combination of a fixed set of linearly independent scalar\nfunctions. The controller updates the coefficients of the parameterized control\ninput in an event-triggered manner so as to minimize a quadratic cost function\nsubject to quadratic constraints and communicates the same to the actuator. We\ndesign an event-triggering rule that guarantees global uniform ultimate\nboundedness of trajectories of the closed loop system and non-trivial\ninter-event times. We illustrate our results through numerical examples and we\nalso compare the performance of the proposed control method with other existing\ncontrol methods in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Background: Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language\nmodels (LLMs), have the potential to enhance technical expertise in magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI), regardless of operator skill or geographic location.\n  Methods: We assessed the accuracy of several LLMs in answering 570 technical\nMRI questions derived from a standardized review book. The questions spanned\nnine MRI topics, including Basic Principles, Image Production, and Safety.\nClosed-source models (e.g., OpenAI's o1 Preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and\nClaude 3.5 Haiku) and open-source models (e.g., Phi 3.5 Mini, Llama 3.1,\nsmolLM2) were tested. Models were queried using standardized prompts via the\nLangChain framework, and responses were graded against correct answers using an\nautomated scoring protocol. Accuracy, defined as the proportion of correct\nanswers, was the primary outcome.\n  Results: The closed-source o1 Preview model achieved the highest accuracy\n(94%), exceeding the random-guess baseline (26.5%). GPT-4o and o1 Mini scored\n88%, and GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Haiku each scored 84%. Among open-source\nmodels, Phi 3.5 Mini performed well, achieving 78% accuracy, comparable to\nseveral closed-source models. Accuracy was highest in Basic Principles and\nInstrumentation categories but lower in Image Weighting and Contrast, History,\nand Artifacts and Corrections.\n  Conclusions: LLMs exhibit high accuracy in addressing technical MRI\nquestions, suggesting their potential to standardize and enhance MRI practice.\nThese models may improve image quality and consistency across varied clinical\nenvironments. Further studies are needed to refine LLMs for clinical use and\nintegrate them into MRI workflows.",

While NGT-QG achieves promising improvements over the vanilla\ngraph-based methods, it has not fully unleashed the potential of integrating\nquantization and graph. For instance, it entails a re-ranking step to compute\nexact distances at the end, which introduces extra random memory accesses; its\ngraph structure is not jointly designed considering the in-batch nature of\nFastScan, which causes wastes of computation in searching. In this work,\nfollowing NGT-QG, we present a new method named SymphonyQG, which achieves more\nsymphonious integration of quantization and graph (e.g., it avoids the explicit\nre-ranking step and refines the graph structure to be more aligned with\nFastScan).

Over the past few years, many studies have\nexplored the long-range dependencies and similarities in MTS. However,\nlong-range dependencies are difficult to model due to their temporal changes\nand high dimensionality makes it difficult to obtain similarities effectively\nand efficiently. Thus, to address these issues, we propose contrast\nsimilarity-aware dual-pathway Mamba for MTS node classification (CS-DPMamba).\nFirstly, to obtain the dynamic similarity of each sample, we initially use\ntemporal contrast learning module to acquire MTS representations. And then we\nconstruct a similarity matrix between MTS representations using Fast Dynamic\nTime Warping (FastDTW). Secondly, we apply the DPMamba to consider the\nbidirectional nature of MTS, allowing us to better capture long-range and\nshort-range dependencies within the data. Finally, we utilize the\nKolmogorov-Arnold Network enhanced Graph Isomorphism Network to complete the\ninformation interaction in the matrix and MTS node classification task. By\ncomprehensively considering the long-range dependencies and dynamic similarity\nfeatures, we achieved precise MTS node classification. We conducted experiments\non multiple University of East Anglia (UEA) MTS datasets, which encompass\ndiverse application scenarios.

Using three\nwaves of household travel surveys from 1997, 2006, and 2017, the research\nemploys a repeated cross-sectional approach to address the limitations of\ntraditional longitudinal and cross-sectional studies. Methodologically, it\nintegrates machine learning and inferential modeling to uncover non-linear\nrelationships and threshold effects of built environment characteristics on\ntravel. Findings reveal that the built environment serves as a sustainable tool\nfor managing travel in the long term, contributing 50% or more to the total\nfeature importance in predicting individual travel-surpassing the combined\neffects of personal and household characteristics. Increased transit\naccessibility, local and regional destination accessibility, population and\nemployment density, and diversity significantly reduce travel, particularly\nwithin their identified thresholds, though the magnitude of their influence\nvaries across time periods. These findings highlight the potential of smart\ngrowth policies-such as expanding transit accessibility, promoting high-density\nand mixed-use development, and discouraging single-use development and\nperipheral sprawl-as effective strategies to reduce car dependency and manage\ntravel demand.",

Our formalism naturally includes the contribution from\nthe intra-band electronic transitions (as well as the inter-band ones) at all\nelectron wavevectors to the phonon linewidths, which is forbidden for\nzone-center optical phonons if infinitesimal electron linewidths are used. As a\nproof of principle, we use the theory to calculate the linewidth of the\ndouble-degenerate, zone-center optical $E_{\\rm 2g}$ phonons of graphene as a\nfunction of the chemical potential. The calculated phonon linewidths obtained\nwith finite electron linewidths differ significantly from those obtained with\ninfinitesimal electron linewidths even at low temperatures.

In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the inherent\nsymmetry breaking effect in atomically thin crystals prompts novel states of\nmatter, such as Ising superconductivity with an extraordinary in-plane upper\ncritical field. Here, we demonstrate that two-dimensional (2D)\nsuperconductivity resembling those in atomic layers but with more fascinating\nbehaviours can be realized in the bulk crystals of two new TMD-based\nsuperconductors Ba0.75ClTaS2 and Ba0.75ClTaSe2. They comprise an alternating\nstack of H-type TMD layers and Ba-Cl layers. In both materials, intrinsic 2D\nsuperconductivity develops below a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.\nThe upper critical field along ab plane exceeds the Pauli limit (Hp); in\nparticular, Ba0.75ClTaSe2 exhibits an extremely high in plane Hc2 (14Hp) and a\ncolossal superconducting anisotropy of 150. Moreover, the temperature-field\nphase diagram of Ba0.75ClTaSe2 under an in-plane magnetic field contains a\nlarge phase regime of vortex dissipation, which can be ascribed to the\nJosephson vortex motion, signifying an unprecedentedly strong fluctuation\neffect in TMD-based superconductors. Our results provide a new path towards the\nestablishment of 2D superconductivity and novel exotic quantum phases in bulk\ncrystals of TMD-based superconductors.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems often rely on large embedding tables that map users and\nitems to dense vectors of uniform size, leading to substantial memory\nconsumption and inefficiencies. This is particularly problematic in\nmemory-constrained environments like mobile and Web of Things (WoT)\napplications, where scalability and real-time performance are critical. Various\nresearch efforts have sought to address these issues. Although embedding\npruning methods utilizing Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) stand out due to their\nlow training and inference costs, consistent sparsity, and end-to-end\ndifferentiability, they face key challenges. Firstly, they typically\ninitializes the mask matrix, which is used to prune redundant parameters, with\nrandom uniform sparse initialization. This strategy often results in suboptimal\nperformance as it creates unstructured and inefficient connections. Secondly,\nthey tend to favor the users/items sampled in the single batch immediately\nbefore weight exploration when they reactivate pruned parameters with large\ngradient magnitudes, which does not necessarily improve the overall\nperformance. Thirdly, while they use sparse weights during forward passes, they\nstill need to compute dense gradients during backward passes. In this paper, we\npropose SparseRec, an lightweight embedding method based on DST, to address\nthese issues. Specifically, SparseRec initializes the mask matrix using\nNonnegative Matrix Factorization. It accumulates gradients to identify the\ninactive parameters that can better improve the model performance after\nactivation. Furthermore, it avoids dense gradients during backpropagation by\nsampling a subset of important vectors. Gradients are calculated only for\nparameters in this subset, thus maintaining sparsity during training in both\nforward and backward passes.",

Vision-based segmentation models\ntypically produce outputs limited to a predefined set of instrument categories,\nwhich restricts their applicability in interactive systems and robotic task\nautomation. Promptable segmentation methods allow selective predictions based\non textual prompts. However, they often rely on the assumption that the\ninstruments present in the scene are already known, and prompts are generated\naccordingly, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen or dynamically\nemerging instruments. In practical surgical environments, where instrument\nexistence information is not provided, this assumption does not hold\nconsistently, resulting in false-positive segmentation. To address these\nlimitations, we formulate a new task called Robust text-promptable Surgical\nInstrument Segmentation (R-SIS). Under this setting, prompts are issued for all\ncandidate categories without access to instrument presence information. R-SIS\nrequires distinguishing which prompts refer to visible instruments and\ngenerating masks only when such instruments are explicitly present in the\nscene. This setting reflects practical conditions where uncertainty in\ninstrument presence is inherent. We evaluate existing segmentation methods\nunder the R-SIS protocol using surgical video datasets and observe substantial\nfalse-positive predictions in the absence of ground-truth instruments. These\nfindings demonstrate a mismatch between current evaluation protocols and\nreal-world use cases, and support the need for benchmarks that explicitly\naccount for prompt uncertainty and instrument absence.",

However, developing robust models for polyp detection is\nchallenging by the limited size and accessibility of existing colonoscopy\ndatasets. While previous efforts have attempted to synthesize colonoscopy\nimages, current methods suffer from instability and insufficient data\ndiversity. Moreover, these approaches lack precise control over the generation\nprocess, resulting in images that fail to meet clinical quality standards. To\naddress these challenges, we propose CCIS-DIFF, a Controlled generative model\nfor high-quality Colonoscopy Image Synthesis based on a Diffusion architecture.\nOur method offers precise control over both the spatial attributes (polyp\nlocation and shape) and clinical characteristics of polyps that align with\nclinical descriptions. Specifically, we introduce a blur mask weighting\nstrategy to seamlessly blend synthesized polyps with the colonic mucosa, and a\ntext-aware attention mechanism to guide the generated images to reflect\nclinical characteristics. Notably, to achieve this, we construct a new\nmulti-modal colonoscopy dataset that integrates images, mask annotations, and\ncorresponding clinical text descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour method generates high-quality, diverse colonoscopy images with fine control\nover both spatial constraints and clinical consistency, offering valuable\nsupport for downstream segmentation and diagnostic tasks.",

The latest advances for single-image 3D reconstruction\nextract a textual description from the input image and further utilize it to\nsynthesize 3D models. However, existing methods focus on capturing a single key\nattribute of the image (e.g., object type, artistic style) and fail to consider\nthe multi-perspective information required for accurate 3D reconstruction, such\nas object shape and material properties. Besides, the reliance on Neural\nRadiance Fields hinders their ability to reconstruct intricate surfaces and\ntexture details. In this work, we propose MTFusion, which leverages both image\ndata and textual descriptions for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. Our approach\nconsists of two stages. First, we adopt a novel multi-word textual inversion\ntechnique to extract a detailed text description capturing the image's\ncharacteristics. Then, we use this description and the image to generate a 3D\nmodel with FlexiCubes. Additionally, MTFusion enhances FlexiCubes by employing\na special decoder network for Signed Distance Functions, leading to faster\ntraining and finer surface representation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate\nthat our MTFusion surpasses existing image-to-3D methods on a wide range of\nsynthetic and real-world images.

Users tracked targets oscillating at 7\npre-defined random frequencies between 0.55 and 2.35 Hz. After session\ncompletion, trajectories of the target, leader, and follower were decomposed\ninto components of gain and phase error for all frequencies. We found that\nwhile tracking performance at the follower port was similar across\ntransmissions, users' adjustment at the leader port differed between Rigid and\nEM transmissions. Users applied different pinch forces between Rigid and\nUnilateral transmissions, suggesting that tracking strategy does change between\ndynamics and feedback.

However, treatments can often be continuous\nvariables, such as drug dosages or nutritional content levels, and non-constant\neffects may occur in many real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider an\nadditive nonlinear, non-constant effects model with unmeasured confounders, in\nwhich treatments can be either discrete or continuous, and propose an\nAuxiliary-based Independence Test (AIT) condition to test whether a variable is\na valid instrument. We first show that if the candidate instrument is valid,\nthen the AIT condition holds.

We also extend the AIT\ncondition to include covariates and introduce a practical testing algorithm.\nExperimental results on both synthetic and three different real-world datasets\nshow the effectiveness of our proposed condition.",

    "abstract": "Synchrotron radiation sources play a crucial role in fields such as materials\nscience, biology, and chemistry. The beamline, a key subsystem of the\nsynchrotron, modulates and directs the radiation to the sample for analysis.\nHowever, the alignment of beamlines is a complex and time-consuming process,\nprimarily carried out manually by experienced engineers. Even minor\nmisalignments in optical components can significantly affect the beam's\nproperties, leading to suboptimal experimental outcomes. Current automated\nmethods, such as bayesian optimization (BO) and reinforcement learning (RL),\nalthough these methods enhance performance, limitations remain. The\nrelationship between the current and target beam properties, crucial for\ndetermining the adjustment, is not fully considered. Additionally, the physical\ncharacteristics of optical elements are overlooked, such as the need to adjust\nspecific devices to control the output beam's spot size or position. This paper\naddresses the alignment of beamlines by modeling it as a Markov Decision\nProcess (MDP) and training an intelligent agent using RL. The agent calculates\nadjustment values based on the current and target beam states, executes\nactions, and iterates until optimal parameters are achieved. A policy network\nwith action attention is designed to improve decision-making by considering\nboth state differences and the impact of optical components. Experiments on two\nsimulated beamlines demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing\nmethods, with ablation studies highlighting the effectiveness of the action\nattention-based policy network.",

    "abstract": "Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) aims to select the most appropriate\nquestions based on the examinee's ability and is widely used in online\neducation. However, existing CAT systems often lack initial understanding of\nthe examinee's ability, requiring random probing questions. This can lead to\npoorly matched questions, extending the test duration and negatively impacting\nthe examinee's mindset, a phenomenon referred to as the Cold Start with\nInsufficient Prior (CSIP) task. This issue occurs because CAT systems do not\neffectively utilize the abundant prior information about the examinee available\nfrom other courses on online platforms. These response records, due to the\ncommonality of cognitive states across different knowledge domains, can provide\nvaluable prior information for the target domain. However, no prior work has\nexplored solutions for the CSIP task. In response to this gap, we propose\nDiffusion Cognitive States TransfeR Framework (DCSR), a novel domain transfer\nframework based on Diffusion Models (DMs) to address the CSIP task.\nSpecifically, we construct a cognitive state transition bridge between domains,\nguided by the common cognitive states of examinees, encouraging the model to\nreconstruct the initial ability state in the target domain. To enrich the\nexpressive power of the generated data, we analyze the causal relationships in\nthe generation process from a causal perspective. Redundant and extraneous\ncognitive states can lead to limited transfer and negative transfer effects.\nOur DCSR can seamlessly apply the generated initial ability states in the\ntarget domain to existing question selection algorithms, thus improving the\ncold start performance of the CAT system. Extensive experiments conducted on\nfive real-world datasets demonstrate that DCSR significantly outperforms\nexisting baseline methods in addressing the CSIP task.",

Although the improvements on\naiming for decreasing number of function evaluations (NFE), the iterative\nresults are still computationally expensive. Consistency models are as a new\nfamily of generative models, enable single-step sampling of high quality data\nwithout the need for adversarial training. In this paper, we introduce the beta\nnoise distribution, which provides flexibility in adjusting noise levels. This\nis combined with a sinusoidal curriculum that enhances the learning of the\ntrajectory between the noise distribution and the posterior distribution of\ninterest, allowing High Noise Improved Consistency Training (HN-iCT) to be\ntrained in a supervised fashion. Additionally, High Noise Improved Consistency\nTraining with Image Condition (HN-iCT-CN) architecture is introduced, enables\nto take Low Dose images as a condition for extracting significant features by\nWeighted Attention Gates (WAG).Our results indicate that unconditional image\ngeneration using HN-iCT significantly outperforms basic CT and iCT training\ntechniques with NFE=1 on the CIFAR10 and CelebA datasets.

    "abstract": "Science prizes purportedly reward innovation and explorations of new\nphenomena. Yet, in practice prizes may inadvertently divert resources from\nsimilarly impactful but less celebrated scholars. Despite this paradox,\nknowledge of how prizewinning relates to innovation is nascent even as prizes\nproliferate widely. Analyzing 2,460 worldwide prizes, we compared the\ninnovativeness of over 23,000 prizewinners and matched non-prizewinners whose\nperformance records were statistically equivalent up to the prize year. First,\nwe find that prizewinners are more innovative. Their research is more likely to\ncombine existing ideas in new ways, integrate a topic's historical and\ncontemporary thinking, and incorporate interdisciplinary perspectives. Second,\nalthough prizewinners and matched non-prizewinners have statistically\nequivalent impact and productivity records up to the prize year, at about five\nyears before the prize, prizewinners' papers become more innovative than their\nmatched peers, a difference that widens each year, peaks during the prize year,\nand then persists for the remainder of their careers. Third, network\nembeddedness predicts unusual innovativeness. Compared to non-prizewinners,\nprizewinners' collaborations are shorter in duration, encompass wider exposure\nto unfamiliar topics, and involve coauthors whose networks minimally overlap\nwith each other. The implications of the findings for the efficacy of reward\nsystems and innovation in science are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict the next purchasing item\naccording to users' dynamic preference learned from their historical user-item\ninteractions. To improve the performance of recommendation, learning dynamic\nheterogeneous cross-type behavior dependencies is indispensable for recommender\nsystem. However, there still exists some challenges in Multi-Behavior\nSequential Recommendation (MBSR). On the one hand, existing methods only model\nheterogeneous multi-behavior dependencies at behavior-level or item-level, and\nmodelling interaction-level dependencies is still a challenge. On the other\nhand, the dynamic multi-grained behavior-aware preference is hard to capture in\ninteraction sequences, which reflects interaction-aware sequential pattern. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose a Multi-Grained Preference enhanced\nTransformer framework (M-GPT). First, M-GPT constructs a interaction-level\ngraph of historical cross-typed interactions in a sequence. Then graph\nconvolution is performed to derive interaction-level multi-behavior dependency\nrepresentation repeatedly, in which the complex correlation between historical\ncross-typed interactions at specific orders can be well learned. Secondly, a\nnovel multi-scale transformer architecture equipped with multi-grained user\npreference extraction is proposed to encode the interaction-aware sequential\npattern enhanced by capturing temporal behavior-aware multi-grained preference\n. Experiments on the real-world datasets indicate that our method M-GPT\nconsistently outperforms various state-of-the-art recommendation methods.",

    "abstract": "3D semantic occupancy prediction, which seeks to provide accurate and\ncomprehensive representations of environment scenes, is important to autonomous\ndriving systems. For autonomous cars equipped with multi-camera and LiDAR, it\nis critical to aggregate multi-sensor information into a unified 3D space for\naccurate and robust predictions. Recent methods are mainly built on the\n2D-to-3D transformation that relies on sensor calibration to project the 2D\nimage information into the 3D space. These methods, however, suffer from two\nmajor limitations: First, they rely on accurate sensor calibration and are\nsensitive to the calibration noise, which limits their application in real\ncomplex environments. Second, the spatial transformation layers are\ncomputationally expensive and limit their running on an autonomous vehicle. In\nthis work, we attempt to exploit a Robust and Efficient 3D semantic Occupancy\n(REO) prediction scheme. To this end, we propose a calibration-free spatial\ntransformation based on vanilla attention to implicitly model the spatial\ncorrespondence. In this way, we robustly project the 2D features to a\npredefined BEV plane without using sensor calibration as input. Then, we\nintroduce 2D and 3D auxiliary training tasks to enhance the discrimination\npower of 2D backbones on spatial, semantic, and texture features. Last, we\npropose a query-based prediction scheme to efficiently generate large-scale\nfine-grained occupancy predictions. By fusing point clouds that provide\ncomplementary spatial information, our REO surpasses the existing methods by a\nlarge margin on three benchmarks, including OpenOccupancy, Occ3D-nuScenes, and\nSemanticKITTI Scene Completion. For instance, our REO achieves 19.8$\\times$\nspeedup compared to Co-Occ, with 1.1 improvements in geometry IoU on\nOpenOccupancy. Our code will be available at https://github.com/ICEORY/REO.",

The trajectory of the fluorescence consists of\nrepetitions of light-emitting (ON) and not-emitting (OFF) states, called\nblinking, and it contains a very large amount of noise due to the several\nreasons, so in principle, it is difficult to distinguish the ON and OFF states\nquantitatively. The fluorescence trajectory is a typical stochastic process,\nand therefore requires advanced time-series data analysis. In the present\nstudy, we analyze the fluorescence trajectories using a hidden Markov model,\nand calculate the probability density of the ON and OFF duration. From the\nanalysis, we found that the ON-duration probability density can be well\ndescribed by an exponential function, and the OFF-duration probability density\ncan be well described by a log-normal function, which are verified in terms of\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test. The time-bin dependence in the fluorescence trajectory\non the probability density is carefully analyzed. We also discuss the ON and\nOFF processes from failure-rate analysis used in life testing of semiconductor\ndevices.",

    "abstract": "Event cameras, when combined with inertial sensors, show significant\npotential for motion estimation in challenging scenarios, such as high-speed\nmaneuvers and low-light environments. There are many methods for producing such\nestimations, but most boil down to a synchronous discrete-time fusion problem.\nHowever, the asynchronous nature of event cameras and their unique fusion\nmechanism with inertial sensors remain underexplored. In this paper, we\nintroduce a monocular event-inertial odometry method called AsynEIO, designed\nto fuse asynchronous event and inertial data within a unified Gaussian Process\n(GP) regression framework. Our approach incorporates an event-driven frontend\nthat tracks feature trajectories directly from raw event streams at a high\ntemporal resolution. These tracked feature trajectories, along with various\ninertial factors, are integrated into the same GP regression framework to\nenable asynchronous fusion. With deriving analytical residual Jacobians and\nnoise models, our method constructs a factor graph that is iteratively\noptimized and pruned using a sliding-window optimizer. Comparative assessments\nhighlight the performance of different inertial fusion strategies, suggesting\noptimal choices for varying conditions. Experimental results on both public\ndatasets and our own event-inertial sequences indicate that AsynEIO outperforms\nexisting methods, especially in high-speed and low-illumination scenarios.",

Experimental results from our study on two hate speech\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-art\nbaselines across AU-ROC, F1, and Recall with improvements of 1.1%, 7%, and 35%,\nrespectively. Given the contextual complexity of the toxicity detection task,\nour approach showcases the significance of learning from both explicit (i.e.\nKG) as well as implicit (i.e. LVLMs) contextual cues incorporated through a\nhybrid neurosymbolic approach.

However, its reliance on neural networks results in a lack of\ntransparency, which limits its practical applications. To achieve\nexplainability, decision trees have emerged as a popular and promising\nalternative to neural networks. Nonetheless, due to their limited\nexpressiveness, traditional decision trees struggle with high-dimensional\nlong-horizon continuous control tasks. In this paper, we proposes SkillTree, a\nnovel framework that reduces complex continuous action spaces into discrete\nskill spaces. Our hierarchical approach integrates a differentiable decision\ntree within the high-level policy to generate skill embeddings, which\nsubsequently guide the low-level policy in executing skills. By making skill\ndecisions explainable, we achieve skill-level explainability, enhancing the\nunderstanding of the decision-making process in complex tasks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to\nskill-based neural networks in complex robotic arm control domains.\nFurthermore, SkillTree offers explanations at the skill level, thereby\nincreasing the transparency of the decision-making process.",

We consider the\nlight diquarks with spin-parity $J^P=0^\\pm$ and $1^\\pm$. Medium corrections to\nthe SHBs are provided through the diquarks whereas the heavy quark is simply\nregarded as a spectator. The chiral dynamics of the diquark are described by\nthe Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model having (pseudo)scalar-type and\n(axial)vector-type four-point interactions and the six-point ones responsible\nfor the $U(1)_A$ axial anomaly. The divergences are handled by means of the\nthree-dimensional proper-time regularization with both ultraviolet and infrared\ncutoffs included, in order to eliminate unphysical imaginary parts. As a\nresult, the mass degeneracies between the parity partners of all the SHBs are\npredicted in accordance with the chiral restoration. In particular, the\nHQS-doublet SHBs exhibit clear mass degeneracies due to the absence of the\ndirect anomaly effects. We also predict a mass degeneracy of $\\Sigma_c$ and\n$\\Omega_c$ above the pseudocritical temperature $T_{\\rm pc}$ of chiral\nrestoration, which results in a peculiar mass hierarchy for positive-parity\nHQS-doublet SHBs where $\\Xi_c'$ becomes heavier than $\\Omega_c$ Besides, it is\nfound that the decay width of $\\Sigma_c\\to\\Lambda_c\\pi$ vanishes above $T_{\\rm\npc}$ reflecting a closing of the threshold. The predicted modifications of\nmasses and decay widths of the SHBs are expected to provide future heavy-ion\ncollision experiments and lattice simulations with useful information on chiral\ndynamics of the diquarks.",

Most of these electrides are metallic and the metal cations\nare primarily from the s-block, d-block, or rare-earth elements. Here, we\nreport a class of p-block metal-based electrides found in bilayer SnO and PbO,\nwhich are semiconducting and feature electride states in both the valence band\n(VB) and conduction band (CB), as referred to 2D \"bipolar\" electrides. These\nbilayers are hybrid electrides where excess electrons are localized in the\ninterlayer region and hybridize with the orbitals of Sn atoms in the VB,\nexhibiting strong covalent-like interactions with neighboring metal atoms.\nCompared to previously studied hybrid electrides, the higher electronegativity\nof Sn and Pb enhances these covalent-like interactions, leading to largely\nenhanced semiconducting bandgap of up to 2.5 eV. Moreover, the CBM primarily\narises from the overlap between metal states and interstitial charges, denoting\na potential electride and forming a free-electron-like (FEL) state with small\neffective mass. This state offers high carrier mobilities for both electron and\nhole in bilayer SnO, suggesting its potential as a promising p-type\nsemiconductor material.",

In\nphotoproduction, quasi-real photons may interact with the whole nucleus or\nindividual nucleons, which is called the coherent and incoherent processes,\nrespectively. The typical momentum of charmonium produced in two processes is\nlocated in $p_T\\lesssim 1/R_A$ and $p_T\\lesssim 1/R_N$, where $R_A$ and $R_N$\nare the radii of nucleus and the nucleon. Both kinds of photoproduction and\nalso hadroproduction are considered to calculate charmonium production in\ndifferent transverse momentum bins, rapidity bins, and collision centralities,\nincorporating modifications from hot QCD matter and initial cold nuclear matter\neffects. Our calculations explain experimental data about charmonium nuclear\nmodification factors and the production cross-section in ultra-peripheral\ncollisions.

We analyze\nmodels governed by the replicator equation of evolutionary game theory and\nrelated Lotka-Volterra systems of population dynamics. These are foundational\nnonlinear models that find widespread application and offer a broad platform\nfor non-Hermitian theory beyond physics. In this context we study the emergence\nof exceptional points in two cases: (a) when the governing symmetry properties\nare tied to global properties of the models, and, in contrast, (b) when these\nsymmetries emerge locally around stationary states--in which case the\nconnection between the linear non-Hermitian model and an underlying nonlinear\nsystem becomes tenuous. We outline further that when the relevant symmetries\nare related to global properties, the location of exceptional points in the\nlinearization around coexistence equilibria coincides with abrupt global\nchanges in the stability of the nonlinear dynamics. Exceptional points may thus\noffer a new local characteristic for the understanding of these systems.\nTri-trophic models of population ecology serve as test cases for\nhigher-dimensional systems.",

We use red giant stars with kinematics and [$\\alpha$/M]\nand [M/H] estimates from Gaia DR3 data to investigate the relationship between\nazimuthal velocity and metallicity, aiming to understand the transition from a\nchaotic proto-Galaxy to a well-ordered, rotating (old) disc-like population. To\nanalyse the structure of the data in [M/H]-v$_\\phi$ space for both high- and\nlow-$\\alpha$ samples with carefully defined $\\alpha$-separation, we develop a\nmodel with two Gaussian components in v$_\\phi$: one representing a disc-like\npopulation and the other a halo-like population.

To quantify the spin-up of the high-$\\alpha$ disc\npopulation, we extend this two-component model by allowing the mean velocity\nand velocity dispersion to vary between the spline knots across the metallicity\nrange used. We also compare our findings with existing literature using\ntraditional Gaussian Mixture Modelling in bins of [M/H] and investigate using\norbital circularity instead of azimuthal velocity. Our findings show that the\nmetal-poor high-$\\alpha$ disc gradually spins up across [M/H] $\\sim$ -1.7 to\n-1.0, while the low-$\\alpha$ sample exhibits a sharp transition at [M/H] $\\sim$\n-1.0. This latter result is due to the accreted debris dominating the\nmetal-poor end, underscoring the critical role of [$\\alpha$/M] selection in\nstudying the (old) disc evolution of the Milky Way.

This allows the model to unify\nboth multi-data and multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range\nof spatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated\nprompt learning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and\ntask-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across\nvarious urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three primary advantages: 1) It\nunifies diverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a\nsequential format, allowing to capture spatio-temporal dynamics across diverse\nscenarios of different cities; 2) With masking strategies and task-specific\nprompts, it supports a wide range of tasks, including bi-directional\nspatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation, spatial extrapolation, and\nspatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes effectively to open-world\nscenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities outperforming nearly all\nbaselines with training data.

Such nonassociative and noncommutative geometric and\nquantum information theories were formulated on phase spaces defined as\ncotangent Lorentz bundles enabled with nonassociative symmetric and\nnonsymmetric metrics and nonlinear and linear connection structures. We outline\nthe analytic methods and proofs that corresponding geometric flow evolution and\ndynamical field equations can be decoupled and integrated in certain general\noff-diagonal forms. New classes of solutions describing nonassociative black\nholes, wormholes, and locally anisotropic cosmological configurations are\nconstructed using such methods. We develop the Batalin-Vilkovisky, BV,\nformalism for quantizing modified gravity theories, MGTs, involving twisted\nstar products and semi-classical models of nonassociative gauge gravity with de\nSitter/affine/ Poincar\\'{e} double structure groups. Such theories can be\nprojected on Lorentz spacetime manifolds in certain forms equivalent to GR or\nMGTs with torsion generalizations etc. We study the properties of the classical\nand quantum BV operators for nonassociative phase spaces and nonassociative\ngauge gravity. Recent results and methods from algebraic QFT are generalized to\ninvolve nonassociative star product deformations of the anomalous master Ward\nidentity.

    "abstract": "We propose and analyze TRAiL (Tangential Randomization in Linear Bandits), a\ncomputationally efficient regret-optimal forced exploration algorithm for\nlinear bandits on action sets that are sublevel sets of strongly convex\nfunctions. TRAiL estimates the governing parameter of the linear bandit problem\nthrough a standard regularized least squares and perturbs the reward-maximizing\naction corresponding to said point estimate along the tangent plane of the\nconvex compact action set before projecting back to it. Exploiting\nconcentration results for matrix martingales, we prove that TRAiL ensures a\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ growth in the inference quality, measured via the minimum\neigenvalue of the design (regressor) matrix with high-probability over a\n$T$-length period. We build on this result to obtain an $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T}\n\\log(T))$ upper bound on cumulative regret with probability at least $ 1 - 1/T$\nover $T$ periods, and compare TRAiL to other popular algorithms for linear\nbandits. Then, we characterize an $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ minimax lower bound for\nany algorithm on the expected regret that covers a wide variety of\naction/parameter sets and noise processes. Our analysis not only expands the\nrealm of lower-bounds in linear bandits significantly, but as a byproduct,\nyields a trade-off between regret and inference quality. Specifically, we prove\nthat any algorithm with an $\\mathcal{O}(T^\\alpha)$ expected regret growth must\nhave an $\\Omega(T^{1-\\alpha})$ asymptotic growth in expected inference quality.\nOur experiments on the $L^p$ unit ball as action sets reveal how this relation\ncan be violated, but only in the short-run, before returning to respect the\nbound asymptotically.

We analyze the properties of this distance, one of which is that it\nprovides a natural embedding of the s-Wasserstein space into a linear space. We\nconclude with several numerical simulations. Even though our theoretical result\nmerely ensures that the new wavelet s-Wasserstein distance is equivalent to the\nclassical W_s distance (up to an error), our numerical simulations show that\nthe new wavelet distance succeeds in capturing the behavior of the exact W_s\ndistance under translations and dilations of probability measures.",

We deployed both a\nvariational autoencoder (VAE) and a masked autoencoder to determine which\nself-supervised model best smooths the visual field data while reconstructing\nsalient features that are less noisy and more predictive of worsening disease.\nOur results indicate that including a categorical p-value at every visual field\nlocation improves the smoothing of visual field data. Masked autoencoders led\nto cleaner denoised data than previous methods, such as variational\nautoencoders. A 4.7% increase in detection of progressing eyes with pointwise\nlinear regression (PLR) was observed. The masked and variational autoencoders'\nsmoothed data predicted glaucoma progression 2.3 months earlier when p-values\nwere included compared to when they were not. The faster prediction of time to\nprogression (TTP) and the higher percentage progression detected support our\nhypothesis that masking out visual field elements during training while\nincluding p-values at each location would improve the task of detection of\nvisual field progression.

    "abstract": "Traits are patterns of brain signals and behaviors that are stable over time\nbut differ across individuals, whereas states are phasic patterns that vary\nover time, are influenced by the environment, yet oscillate around the traits.\nThe quality of a social interaction depends on the traits and states of the\ninteracting agents. However, it remains unclear how to decipher both traits and\nstates from the same set of brain signals. To explore the hidden neural traits\nand states in relation to the behavioral ones during social interactions, we\ndeveloped a pipeline to extract latent dimensions of the brain from\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) data collected during a team flow task. Our pipeline\ninvolved two stages of dimensionality reduction: first, non-negative matrix\nfactorization (NMF), followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This\npipeline resulted in an interpretable, seven-dimensional EEG latent space that\nrevealed a trait-state hierarchical structure, with macro-segregation capturing\nneural traits and micro-segregation capturing neural states. Out of the seven\nlatent dimensions, we found that three that significantly contributed to\nvariations across individuals and task states. Using representational\nsimilarity analysis, we mapped the EEG latent space to a skill-cognition space,\nestablishing a connection between hidden neural signatures and social\ninteraction behaviors. Our method demonstrates the feasibility of representing\nboth traits and states within a single model that correlates with changes in\nsocial behavior.",

A central method in this process is inductive\ncoding, where researchers identify and interpret codes directly from the\ndatasets themselves. Yet, this exploratory approach poses challenges for\nmeeting methodological expectations (such as ``depth'' and ``variation''),\nespecially as researchers increasingly adopt Generative AI (GAI) for support.\nGround-truth-based metrics are insufficient because they contradict the\nexploratory nature of inductive coding, while manual evaluation can be\nlabor-intensive.

The essential components $B\\to K$ scalar, vector and\ntensor transition form factors (TFFs) are calculated by using the QCD\nlight-cone sum rules approach up to next-to-leading order QCD corrections.

In addition, we obtain upper limits for the remaining\nsources. In terms of total gas fractions ($F_{gas}$), our sample is divided\ninto two different regimes with a steep transition at $\\log\nM_{*}/M_\\odot\\approx10.5$. Galaxies below that threshold have gas fractions\nthat in some cases are close to unity, indicating that their gas reservoir has\nbeen replenished by inflows from the cosmic web. However, objects at $\\log\nM_{*}/M_\\odot>10.5$ display significantly lower gas fractions and are dominated\nby AGN (12 out of 20). Stacking results yield $F_{gas}\\approx0.55$ for massive\nemitters excluding AGN, and $F_{gas}\\approx0.35$ when examining only AGN\ncandidates. Furthermore, depletion times show that most H$\\alpha$ emitters may\nbecome passive by $1<z<1.6$, concurrently with the surge and dominance of the\nred sequence in the most massive clusters. Our analyses suggest that galaxies\nin the outskirts of the protocluster have larger molecular-to-stellar mass\nratios and lower star formation efficiencies than in the core. However, star\nformation across the protocluster remains consistent with the main sequence,\nindicating that evolution is primarily driven by the depletion of the gas\nreservoir towards the inner regions. We discuss the relative importance of\nin-/outflow processes in regulating star formation during the early phases of\ncluster assembly and conclude that a combination of feedback and\noverconsumption may be responsible for the rapid cold gas depletion these\nobjects endure.",

However, DL\nsystems are prone to bugs from many sources, including training data. Existing\nliterature suggests that bugs in training data are highly prevalent, but little\nresearch has focused on understanding their impacts on the models used in\nsoftware engineering tasks. In this paper, we address this research gap through\na comprehensive empirical investigation focused on three types of data\nprevalent in software engineering tasks: code-based, text-based, and\nmetric-based. Using state-of-the-art baselines, we compare the models trained\non clean datasets with those trained on datasets with quality issues and\nwithout proper preprocessing. By analysing the gradients, weights, and biases\nfrom neural networks under training, we identify the symptoms of data quality\nand preprocessing issues. Our analysis reveals that quality issues in code data\ncause biased learning and gradient instability, whereas problems in text data\nlead to overfitting and poor generalisation of models. On the other hand,\nquality issues in metric data result in exploding gradients and model\noverfitting, and inadequate preprocessing exacerbates these effects across all\nthree data types. Finally, we demonstrate the validity and generalizability of\nour findings using six new datasets.

Recently, Aoyama et al. (2018) introduced the accretion shock model\nas an alternative mechanism for hydrogen line emission. However, it remains\nunclear which model is more appropriate for accreting planets and substellar\nobjects.

The results showed that the emission\nmechanisms of 15 data points are best explained by the shock model, while 55\ndata points are best explained by the flow model. For the 15 data points\nexplained by the planetary shock model, the shock model estimates up to several\ntimes higher mass accretion rates than the flow model.

Its mass ratio is lower than V1187 Her, making TYC\n3801-1529-1 the lowest mass-ratio contact binary ever found in the universe.\nThe light curves observed in 2022 are asymmetric, which is aptly explained by a\nhot spot on the primary component. A 16-year eclipse timings analysis indicates\na secular increase orbital period with a rate of\ndp/dt$=7.96(\\pm0.35)\\times10^{-7}$ d yr$^{-1}$. We studied the stability of\nthis target and identified that not only the value of $J_{spin}/J_{orb}$, but\nalso the mass ratio surpass the unstable boundary. Hence, TYC 3801-1529-1\npresents a challenge to theoretical research and ought to be considered a\nprogenitor of a contact binary merger.",

    "abstract": "Simulating quantum systems using classical computing equipment has been a\nsignificant research focus. This work demonstrates that circuits as large and\ncomplex as the random circuit sampling (RCS) circuits published as a part of\nGoogle's pioneering work [4-7] claiming quantum supremacy can be effectively\nsimulated with high fidelity on classical systems commonly available to\ndevelopers, using the universal quantum simulator included in the Quantum Rings\nSDK, making this advancement accessible to everyone. This study achieved an\naverage linear cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) score of 0.678, indicating a\nstrong correlation with ideal quantum simulation and exceeding the XEB values\ncurrently reported for the same circuits today while completing circuit\nexecution in a reasonable timeframe. This capability empowers researchers and\ndevelopers to build, debug, and execute large-scale quantum circuits ahead of\nthe general availability of low-error rate quantum computers and invent new\nquantum algorithms or deploy commercial-grade applications.",

    "abstract": "The population control problem is a parameterized control problem where a\npopulation of agents has to be moved simultaneously into a target state. The\ndecision problem asks whether this can be achieved for a finite but arbitrarily\nlarge population. We focus on the random version of this problem, where every\nagent is a copy of the same automaton and non-determinism on the global action\nchosen by the controller is resolved independently and uniformly at random.\nController seeks to almost-surely gather the agents in the target states. We\nshow that the random population control problem is exptime-complete.",

    "abstract": "Smart inverters are instrumental in the integration of renewable and\ndistributed energy resources (DERs) into the electric grid. Such inverters rely\non communication layers for continuous control and monitoring, potentially\nexposing them to cyber-physical attacks such as false data injection attacks\n(FDIAs). We propose to construct a defense strategy against a priori unknown\nFDIAs with a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The first\nagent is an adversary that simulates and discovers various FDIA strategies,\nwhile the second agent is a defender in charge of detecting and localizing\nFDIAs. This approach enables the defender to be trained against new FDIAs\ncontinuously generated by the adversary. The numerical results demonstrate that\nthe proposed MARL defender outperforms a supervised offline defender.\nAdditionally, we show that the detection skills of an MARL defender can be\ncombined with that of an offline defender through a transfer learning approach.",
