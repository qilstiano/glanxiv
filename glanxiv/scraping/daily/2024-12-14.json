    "abstract": "Human collaboration benefits from continuous coordination -- planning,\ndelegating tasks, sharing progress, and adjusting objectives -- to align on\nshared goals. However, agentic AI systems often limit users to previewing or\nreviewing an agent's plans for fully autonomous execution. While this may be\nuseful for confirmation and correction, it does not support deeper\ncollaboration between humans and AI agents. We present Cocoa, a system that\nintroduces a novel design pattern -- interactive plans -- for collaborating\nwith an AI agent on complex, multi-step tasks. Informed by a formative study\n($n=9$), Cocoa builds on interaction designs from computational notebooks and\ndocument editors to support flexible delegation of agency through Co-planning\nand Co-execution, where users collaboratively compose and execute plans with an\nAgent. Using scientific research as a sample domain, our lab (n=16) and field\ndeployment (n=7) studies found that Cocoa improved agent steerability without\nsacrificing ease-of-use compared to a strong chat baseline. Additionally,\nresearchers valued Cocoa for real-world projects and saw the interleaving of\nco-planning and co-execution as an effective novel paradigm for human-AI\ncollaboration.",

    "abstract": "The intersection between nonsymmorphic symmetry and electronic correlations\nhas emerged as a platform for topological Kondo semimetallic states and\nunconventional spin textures. Here we report the synthesis of nonsymmorphic\nUPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$ single crystals and their structural, electronic, magnetic,\nand thermodynamic properties. UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$ orders antiferromagnetically\n(AFM) below $T_N\\simeq$ 161 K as evidenced by a sharp cusp in magnetic\nsusceptibility, a second-order phase transition in specific heat, and an upturn\nin electrical resistivity, which suggests an incommensurate AFM structure that\ndeviates from the A-type magnetism typically observed in this class of\nmaterials. Across $T_N$, Hall effect measurements reveal a change from\nelectron-dominated to hole-dominated transport, which points to a sharp\nreconstruction in the electronic structure at $T_N$. Upon further cooling, a\nfirst-order transition is observed at $T_1 \\simeq 30 $K in magnetic\nsusceptibility and heat capacity but not in electrical resistivity or Hall\nmeasurements, which indicates a small change in the AFM structure that does not\naffect the electronic structure. Our specific heat data reveal a small\nSommerfeld coefficient ($\\gamma \\simeq$13 mJmol$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$), consistent\nwith localized 5$f$ electrons. Our results indicate that UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$\nhosts weak electronic correlations and is likely away from a Kondo semimetallic\nstate. Low-temperature magnetization measurements show that the AFM structure\nis remarkably stable to 160 kOe and does not undergo any field-induced\ntransitions. Neutron diffraction and magnetization experiments at higher fields\nwould be valuable to probe the presence of unconventional spin textures.",

The\nrecent development of high frequency, micro-ultrasound imaging offers improved\nresolution compared to conventional ultrasound and potentially a better ability\nto differentiate clinically significant cancer from normal tissue. However, the\nfeatures of prostate cancer remain subtle, with ambiguous borders with normal\ntissue and large variations in appearance, making it challenging for both\nmachine learning and humans to localize it on micro-ultrasound images.\n  We propose a novel Mask Enhanced Deeply-supervised Micro-US network, termed\nMedMusNet, to automatically and more accurately segment prostate cancer to be\nused as potential targets for biopsy procedures. MedMusNet leverages predicted\nmasks of prostate cancer to enforce the learned features layer-wisely within\nthe network, reducing the influence of noise and improving overall consistency\nacross frames.\n  MedMusNet successfully detected 76% of clinically significant cancer with a\nDice Similarity Coefficient of 0.365, significantly outperforming the baseline\nSwin-M2F in specificity and accuracy (Wilcoxon test, Bonferroni correction,\np-value<0.05). While the lesion-level and patient-level analyses showed\nimproved performance compared to human experts and different baseline, the\nimprovements did not reach statistical significance, likely on account of the\nsmall cohort.\n  We have presented a novel approach to automatically detect and segment\nclinically significant prostate cancer on B-mode micro-ultrasound images.

While evidence supports both models, their specific\ncontributions remain uncertain. One supportive piece of evidence for the SSC\nmodel is the correlation between synchrotron and SSC fluxes in some blazar's\nSpectral Energy Distribution (SED), indicating the relative contributions of\nleptonic and hadronic mechanisms. Observational studies of the HBL blazar\nMarkarian 421 over several years, spanning TeV gamma rays and X-rays, have\nreported a linear correlation across various timescales, which breaks at the\nhighest gamma-ray fluxes. Extending this analysis to four High synchrotron\npeaked BL Lac (HBL) blazars -- Markarian 501, 1ES 1959+650, PKS 2155-304 and\n1ES 2344+514.-- we utilize multiwavelength data from ground-based Imaging\nAtmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) for gamma rays and satellite\nobservations for X-rays.

Notably, the exceptional flaring\nepisode of PKS 2155-304 exhibits a correlation index of 2 with extreme values\nof gamma-ray fluxes. We observe outliers with high gamma-ray fluxes, suggesting\nthe involvement of another mechanism, either of hadronic or leptonic origin.\nFinally, all other correlations exhibit alignment with a general correlation,\nsuggesting a common acceleration mechanism among them with slight variations\nlikely due to individual magnetic field strengths.",

Then\nfollows the study the statistical stability of the model by examining the\nexistence of an invariant measure to the perturbed system. Once done with the\nwell-posedness and the stability of the stochastic model, we then examine a\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) scheme to estimate the parameters involved\nin the model. The paper ends with a brief discussion on potential future\ndevelopments follows by an appendix whose goal is to make the paper as self\ncontained as possible.",

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of urban transportation, shared e-mobility\nservices have emerged as a sustainable solution to meet growing demand for\nflexible, eco-friendly travel. However, the existing literature lacks a\ncomprehensive multi-modal optimization framework with focus on user preferences\nand real-world constraints. This paper presents a multi-modal optimization\nframework for shared e-mobility, with a particular focus on e-mobility hubs\n(e-hubs) with micromobility. We propose and evaluate two approaches: a\nmixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solution, complemented by a heuristic\ngraph reduction technique to manage computational complexity in scenarios with\nlimited e-hubs, achieving a computational advantage of 93%, 72%, and 47% for\n20, 50, and 100 e-hubs, respectively. Additionally, the modified Dijkstra's\nalgorithm offers a more scalable, real-time alternative for larger e-hub\nnetworks, with median execution times consistently around 53 ms, regardless of\nthe number of e-hubs. Thorough experimental evaluation on real-world map and\nsimulated traffic data of Dublin City Centre reveals that both methods\nseamlessly adapt to practical considerations and constraints such as\nmulti-modality, user-preferences and state of charge for different e-mobility\ntools. While MILP offers greater flexibility for incorporating additional\nobjectives and constraints, the modified Dijkstra's algorithm is better suited\nfor large-scale, real-time applications due to its computational efficiency.",

However, the anisotropic nature of CMR\nimages, characterized by large inter-slice distances and misalignments from\ncardiac motion, poses significant challenges to accurate model reconstruction.\nThese limitations result in data loss and measurement inaccuracies, hindering\nthe capture of detailed anatomical structures. This study introduces MorphiNet,\na novel network that enhances heart model reconstruction by leveraging\nhigh-resolution Computer Tomography (CT) images, unpaired with CMR images, to\nlearn heart anatomy.

A\nmulti-layer graph subdivision network refines these geometries while\nmaintaining dense point correspondence. The proposed method achieves high\nanatomy fidelity, demonstrating approximately 40% higher Dice scores, half the\nHausdorff distance, and around 3 mm average surface error compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Some bright filaments, which form a fractured arc with a radius of\nabout 1.85 pc centered on the Sgr C star-forming molecular clump, likely trace\nionization fronts. The brightest filaments form a `$\\pi$-shaped' structure in\nthe center of the HII region. Fainter filaments radiate away from the surface\nof the Sgr C molecular cloud. The filaments are emitting optically thin\nfree-free emission, as revealed by spectral index measurements from 1.28 GHz\n(MeerKAT) to 97 GHz (ALMA). But, the negative in-band 1 to 2 GHz spectral index\nin the MeerKAT data alone reveals the presence of a non-thermal component\nacross the entire Sgr C HII region. We argue that the plasma flow in Sgr C is\ncontrolled by magnetic fields, which confine the plasma to rope-like filaments\nor sheets. This results in the measured non-thermal component of low-frequency\nradio emission plasma, as well as a plasma $\\beta$ (thermal pressure divided by\nmagnetic pressure) below 1, even in the densest regions.

The algorithm operates in two phases: first, it estimates\nneighboring estimates using quantized communication information, then it\ncreates a fusion estimate by combining these estimates through a\nconsensus-based distributed stochastic approximation approach. To tackle the\ndifficulty caused by the coupling between these two estimates, two combined\nLyapunov functions are constructed to analyze the convergence performance.\nSpecifically, the mean-square convergence of the estimates is established under\na conditional expectation-type cooperative excitation condition and the union\ntopology containing a spanning tree. Besides, the convergence rate is derived\nto match the step size's order under suitable step-size coefficients.\nFurthermore, the impact of communication uncertainties including stochastic\ncommunication noise and Markov-switching rate is analyzed on the convergence\nrate.

    "abstract": "Visual inspection of confined spaces such as aircraft wings is ergonomically\nchallenging for human mechanics. This work presents a novel crane robot that\ncan travel the entire span of the aircraft wing, enabling mechanics to perform\ninspection from outside of the confined space. However, teleoperation of the\ncrane robot can still be a challenge due to the need to avoid obstacles in the\nworkspace and potential oscillations of the camera payload. The main\ncontribution of this work is to exploit the differential flatness of the\ncrane-robot dynamics for designing reduced-oscillation, collision-free time\ntrajectories of the camera payload for use in teleoperation. Autonomous\nexperiments verify the efficacy of removing undesired oscillations by 89%.\nFurthermore, teleoperation experiments demonstrate that the controller\neliminated collisions (from 33% to 0%) when 12 participants performed an\ninspection task with the use of proposed trajectory selection when compared to\nthe case without it. Moreover, even discounting the failures due to collisions,\nthe proposed approach improved task efficiency by 18.7% when compared to the\ncase without it.",

We present a\ndecoupled 3D segmentation pipeline to ensure modularity and adaptability to\nnovel 3D representations as well as semantic segmentation foundation models. We\nfirst reconstruct a scene with 3D Gaussians and learn class-agnostic features\nthrough contrastive supervision from a 2D instance proposal network.

Our decoupled design (1) provides a\nplug-and-play interface for swapping different 2D or 3D modules, (2) ensures\nmulti-object instance segmentation at no extra cost, and (3) leverages rich 3D\ngeometry for robust scene understanding.

Of those that do, none can directly model multiple\nbinding ligands concurrently or have been rigorously benchmarked on\npharmacologically relevant drug targets, hindering their widespread adoption in\ndrug discovery efforts. In this work, we propose FlowDock, the first deep\ngeometric generative model based on conditional flow matching that learns to\ndirectly map unbound (apo) structures to their bound (holo) counterparts for an\narbitrary number of binding ligands. Furthermore, FlowDock provides predicted\nstructural confidence scores and binding affinity values with each of its\ngenerated protein-ligand complex structures, enabling fast virtual screening of\nnew (multi-ligand) drug targets. For the well-known PoseBusters Benchmark\ndataset, FlowDock outperforms single-sequence AlphaFold 3 with a 51% blind\ndocking success rate using unbound (apo) protein input structures and without\nany information derived from multiple sequence alignments, and for the\nchallenging new DockGen-E dataset, FlowDock outperforms single-sequence\nAlphaFold 3 and matches single-sequence Chai-1 for binding pocket\ngeneralization. Additionally, in the ligand category of the 16th community-wide\nCritical Assessment of Techniques for Structure Prediction (CASP16), FlowDock\nranked among the top-5 methods for pharmacological binding affinity estimation\nacross 140 protein-ligand complexes, demonstrating the efficacy of its learned\nrepresentations in virtual screening.

    "abstract": "Quantum measurements often exhibit non-classical features, such as\ncontextuality, which generalizes Bell's non-locality and serves as a resource\nin various quantum computation models. Existing frameworks have rigorously\ncaptured these phenomena, and recently, simplicial distributions have been\nintroduced to deepen this understanding. The geometrical structure of\nsimplicial distributions can be seen as a resource for applications in quantum\ninformation theory. In this work, we use topological foundations to study this\ngeometrical structure, leveraging the fact that, in this simplicial framework,\nmeasurements and outcomes are represented as spaces. This allows us to depict\ncontextuality as a topological phenomenon. We show that applying the cone\nconstruction to the measurement space makes the corresponding non-signaling\npolytope equal to the join of $m$ copies of the original polytope, where $m$ is\nthe number of possible outcomes per measurement. Then we glue two copies of\ncone measurement spaces to obtain a suspension measurement space. The\ndecomposition done for simplicial distributions on a cone measurement space\nprovides deeper insights into the geometry of simplicial distributions on a\nsuspension measurement space and aids in characterizing the contextuality\nthere.

Despite the long history of MOO, recent years have witnessed a surge\nin interest within the ML community in the development of gradient manipulation\nalgorithms for MOO, thanks to the availability of gradient information in many\nML problems. However, existing gradient manipulation methods for MOO often\nsuffer from long training times, primarily due to the need for computing\ndynamic weights by solving an additional optimization problem to determine a\ncommon descent direction that can decrease all objectives simultaneously. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a new and efficient algorithm called\nPeriodic Stochastic Multi-Gradient Descent (PSMGD) to accelerate MOO. PSMGD is\nmotivated by the key observation that dynamic weights across objectives exhibit\nsmall changes under minor updates over short intervals during the optimization\nprocess. Consequently, our PSMGD algorithm is designed to periodically compute\nthese dynamic weights and utilizes them repeatedly, thereby effectively\nreducing the computational overload. Theoretically, we prove that PSMGD can\nachieve state-of-the-art convergence rates for strongly-convex, general convex,\nand non-convex functions. Additionally, we introduce a new computational\ncomplexity measure, termed backpropagation complexity, and demonstrate that\nPSMGD could achieve an objective-independent backpropagation complexity.\nThrough extensive experiments, we verify that PSMGD can provide comparable or\nsuperior performance to state-of-the-art MOO algorithms while significantly\nreducing training time.",

I frame the gender identity problem as a modified\n\\textit{battle of the sexes} game, where individuals define their gender\nidentity under pairwise matching motives. From a baseline game-theoretical\nstandpoint, I demonstrate that the binary-only world and the nonbinary-only\nworld are both Nash equilibria in the stage game and are locally stable in the\ninfinitely repeated game. Thus, any state of gender identity could\ntheoretically persist. I then adopt a genetic learning algorithm as an\nequilibrium selection criterion to investigate evolutionary dynamics further\nand provide a rationale for the transition from binary to nonbinary gender\nidentity. Specifically, in a binary-origin world, divergence occurs as\nindividuals identifying as nonbinary gender evolve to become the majority due\nto their higher flexibility in matching outcomes.

We present SoftVQ-VAE, a continuous\nimage tokenizer that leverages soft categorical posteriors to aggregate\nmultiple codewords into each latent token, substantially increasing the\nrepresentation capacity of the latent space. When applied to Transformer-based\narchitectures, our approach compresses 256x256 and 512x512 images using as few\nas 32 or 64 1-dimensional tokens. Not only does SoftVQ-VAE show consistent and\nhigh-quality reconstruction, more importantly, it also achieves\nstate-of-the-art and significantly faster image generation results across\ndifferent denoising-based generative models. Remarkably, SoftVQ-VAE improves\ninference throughput by up to 18x for generating 256x256 images and 55x for\n512x512 images while achieving competitive FID scores of 1.78 and 2.21 for\nSiT-XL. It also improves the training efficiency of the generative models by\nreducing the number of training iterations by 2.3x while maintaining comparable\nperformance. With its fully-differentiable design and semantic-rich latent\nspace, our experiment demonstrates that SoftVQ-VAE achieves efficient\ntokenization without compromising generation quality, paving the way for more\nefficient generative models.

While\nresearch into noninvasive T2DM screening tools has advanced, conventional\nmachine learning approaches remain limited to unimodal inputs due to extensive\nfeature engineering requirements. In contrast, deep learning models can\nleverage multimodal data for a more holistic understanding of patients' health\nconditions.

This study\nevaluates the integration of CXR images with other noninvasive data sources,\nincluding electronic health records (EHRs) and electrocardiography signals, for\nT2DM detection. Utilising datasets meticulously compiled from the MIMIC-IV\ndatabases, we investigated two deep fusion paradigms: an early fusion-based\nmultimodal transformer and a modular joint fusion ResNet-LSTM architecture. The\nend-to-end trained ResNet-LSTM model achieved an AUROC of 0.86, surpassing the\nCXR-only baseline by 2.3% with just 9863 training samples.

    "abstract": "High-resolution spatiotemporal simulations effectively capture the\ncomplexities of atmospheric plume dispersion in complex terrain. However, their\nhigh computational cost makes them impractical for applications requiring rapid\nresponses or iterative processes, such as optimization, uncertainty\nquantification, or inverse modeling. To address this challenge, this work\nintroduces the Dual-Stage Temporal Three-dimensional UNet Super-resolution\n(DST3D-UNet-SR) model, a highly efficient deep learning model for plume\ndispersion prediction. DST3D-UNet-SR is composed of two sequential modules: the\ntemporal module (TM), which predicts the transient evolution of a plume in\ncomplex terrain from low-resolution temporal data, and the spatial refinement\nmodule (SRM), which subsequently enhances the spatial resolution of the TM\npredictions. We train DST3DUNet- SR using a comprehensive dataset derived from\nhigh-resolution large eddy simulations (LES) of plume transport. We propose the\nDST3D-UNet-SR model to significantly accelerate LES simulations of\nthree-dimensional plume dispersion by three orders of magnitude. Additionally,\nthe model demonstrates the ability to dynamically adapt to evolving conditions\nthrough the incorporation of new observational data, substantially improving\nprediction accuracy in high-concentration regions near the source.\n  Keywords: Atmospheric sciences, Geosciences, Plume transport,3D temporal\nsequences, Artificial intelligence, CNN, LSTM, Autoencoder, Autoregressive\nmodel, U-Net, Super-resolution, Spatial Refinement.",

    "abstract": "Diversification is a useful tool for exploring large collections of\ninformation items. It has been used to reduce redundancy and cover multiple\nperspectives in information-search settings. Diversification finds applications\nin many different domains, including presenting search results of\ninformation-retrieval systems and selecting suggestions for recommender\nsystems.\n  Interestingly, existing measures of diversity are defined over \\emph{sets} of\nitems, rather than evaluating \\emph{sequences} of items. This design choice\ncomes in contrast with commonly-used relevance measures, which are distinctly\ndefined over sequences of items, taking into account the ranking of items. The\nimportance of employing sequential measures is that information items are\nalmost always presented in a sequential manner, and during their\ninformation-exploration activity users tend to prioritize items with\nhigher~ranking.\n  In this paper, we study the problem of \\emph{maximizing sequential\ndiversity}. This is a new measure of \\emph{diversity}, which accounts for the\n\\emph{ranking} of the items, and incorporates \\emph{item relevance} and\n\\emph{user behavior}. The overarching framework can be instantiated with\ndifferent diversity measures, and here we consider the measures of\n\\emph{sum~diversity} and \\emph{coverage~diversity}. The problem was recently\nproposed by Coppolillo et al.~\\citep{coppolillo2024relevance}, where they\nintroduce empirical methods that work well in practice. Our paper is a\ntheoretical treatment of the problem: we establish the problem hardness and\npresent algorithms with constant approximation guarantees for both diversity\nmeasures we consider. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our methods are\ncompetitive against strong baselines.",

    "abstract": "While the human visual system employs distinct mechanisms to perceive salient\nand camouflaged objects, existing models struggle to disentangle these tasks.\nSpecifically, salient object detection (SOD) models frequently misclassify\ncamouflaged objects as salient, while camouflaged object detection (COD) models\nconversely misinterpret salient objects as camouflaged. We hypothesize that\nthis can be attributed to two factors: (i) the specific annotation paradigm of\ncurrent SOD and COD datasets, and (ii) the lack of explicit attribute\nrelationship modeling in current models. Prevalent SOD/COD datasets enforce a\nmutual exclusivity constraint, assuming scenes contain either salient or\ncamouflaged objects, which poorly aligns with the real world. Furthermore,\ncurrent SOD/COD methods are primarily designed for these highly constrained\ndatasets and lack explicit modeling of the relationship between salient and\ncamouflaged objects. In this paper, to promote the development of unconstrained\nsalient and camouflaged object detection, we construct a large-scale dataset,\nUSC12K, which features comprehensive labels and four different scenes that\ncover all possible logical existence scenarios of both salient and camouflaged\nobjects. To explicitly model the relationship between salient and camouflaged\nobjects, we propose a model called USCNet, which introduces two distinct prompt\nquery mechanisms for modeling inter-sample and intra-sample attribute\nrelationships. Additionally, to assess the model's ability to distinguish\nbetween salient and camouflaged objects, we design an evaluation metric called\nCSCS. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all\nscenes in various metrics. The code and dataset will be available at\nhttps://github.com/ssecv/USCNet.",

    "abstract": "An organism that is newly introduced into an existing population has a\nsurvival probability that is dependent on both the population density of its\nenvironment and the competition it experiences with the members of that\npopulation. Expanding populations naturally form regions of high and low\ndensity, and simultaneously experience ecological interactions both internally\nand at the boundary of their range. For this reason, systems of expanding\npopulations are ideal for studying the combination of density and ecological\neffects. Conservation ecologists have been studying the ability of an invasive\nspecies to establish for some time, attributing success to both ecological and\nspatial factors. Similar behaviors have been observed in spatially structured\ncell populations, such as those found in cancerous tumors and bacterial\nbiofilms. In these scenarios, novel organisms may be the introduction of a new\nmutation or bacterial species with some form of drug resistance, leading to the\npossibility of treatment failure. In order to gain insight into the\nrelationship between population density and ecological interactions, we study\nan expanding population of interacting wild-type cells and mutant cells. We\nsimulate these interactions in time and study the spatially dependent\nprobability for a mutant to survive or to take over the front of the population\nwave (gene surfing). Additionally, we develop a mathematical model that\ndescribes this survival probability and find agreement when the payoff for the\nmutant is positive (corresponding to cooperation, exploitation, or\ncommensalism). By knowing the types of interactions, our model provides insight\ninto the spatial distribution of survival probability. Conversely, given a\nspatial distribution of survival probabilities, our model provides insight into\nthe types of interactions that were involved to generate it.",

    "abstract": "Edge computing is considered a key paradigm for supporting real-time\napplications over 5G networks, as hosting applications at the network edge can\nsubstantially reduce delays. A significant fraction of real-time applications\nover 5G are expected to be highly mobile applications. However, one challenge\nwith hosting mobile applications on the network edge is ensuring that users\ncontinue to get low latency as they move across different locations. This\nrequires the support to handover clients to different edge sites with\nnegligible application delays. However, many edge applications are stateful and\ncan experience significant downtime during state migration over 5G. This paper\naddresses the problem of enabling stateful mobile edge applications in 5G\nnetworks. We first identify the key architectural issues and then propose a new\nsystem design, EdgeWarp, that mitigates delays during mobility through\nproactive application state migration. To enable this, we extend the existing\nedge data stores with the design of a novel two-step application state\nsynchronization protocol, that leverages the early prediction of the target\nedge host. Additionally, EdgeWarp prioritizes the handover of latency-sensitive\nedge applications by communicating their latency requirements to the 5G control\nplane at the beginning of a data session. Our evaluation with real edge\napplications shows up to a 15.4x reduction in application downtime under\nmobility. We have made our anonymized code publicly accessible here.",

The control of certain properties and functionalities\nof systems on the microscale presents a particular challenge since thermal\nfluctuations and environmental perturbations dominate. While synthetic active\nmatter has demonstrated remarkable self-organization capabilities, examples of\nautonomous regulation processes at the single-particle level remain scarce.\nHere, we show that the interplay of two non-equilibrium processes leads to a\nregulated polarization state of active particles in local osmotic flow fields.\nThe balance between thermophoretic repulsion and attraction by thermo-osmotic\nboundary flows, both generated by a single heat source, yields a steady state\nat which active particles encircle the heat source at a distance that depends\non the temperature of the heat source. The balance of both temperature-induced\nprocesses causes a polarization of the active particles that is independent of\nthe heat source temperature. The individual control of heat source and active\nparticles in the experiment allows a detailed investigation of the\nself-regulated polarization effect in which we find that hydrodynamic\ninteractions dominate. As the effects rely on osmotic flows and phoretic\ninteractions, we expect that the observed phenomena can be generalized to other\nactive systems and flow fields.",

The TF localization\ncharacteristics examine how concentrated or spread out the energy of a pulse is\nin the joint TF domain, the time domain (TD), and the frequency domain (FD). We\nfirst derive the TF localization metrics of the DDOP, including its TF area,\nits time and frequency dispersions, and its direction parameter. Based on these\nresults, we demonstrate that the DDOP exhibits a high energy spread in the TD,\nFD, and the joint TF domain, while adhering to the Heisenberg uncertainty\nprinciple. Thereafter, we discuss the potential advantages brought by the\nenergy spread of the DDOP, especially with regard to harnessing both time and\nfrequency diversities and enabling fine-resolution sensing. Subsequently, we\nexamine the relationships between the time and frequency dispersions of the\nDDOP and those of the envelope functions of DDOP's TD and FD representations,\npaving the way for simplified determination of the TF localization metrics for\nmore generalized variants of the DDOP and the pulses used in other DD domain\nmodulation schemes.

A lexicon-based, unsupervised methodology\nwas developed to measure \"extreme opinions\" by considering factors such as\nanger, polarity, and subjectivity. The analysis identifies significant peaks in\nextremism scores that correspond to pivotal real-life events, such as the IDF's\nbombings of Al Quds Hospital and the Jabalia Refugee Camp, and the end of a\nceasefire following a terrorist attack. Additionally, this study explores the\ndistribution and correlation of these scores across different subreddits and\nover time, providing insights into the propagation of polarised sentiments in\nresponse to conflict events. By examining the quantitative effects of each\nscore on extremism and analysing word cloud similarities through Jaccard\nindices, the research offers a nuanced understanding of the factors driving\nextreme online opinions.

Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a\npowerful tool to extract meaningful insights from this data.

Such a phenomenon disagrees with the training requirements of most\nexisting spatial-temporal forecasting methods, which jeopardizes their\neffectiveness and thus blocks broader deployment.

To handle this problem, we\npropose a principled framework named ST-FiT. ST-FiT consists of two key\nlearning components: temporal data augmentation and spatial graph topology\nlearning.

No closed-form expression for the\nphasing of GWs are available to date that contain information from both spin\nand eccentricity. The introduction of eccentricity can slow waveform\ngeneration, often requiring slower numerical methods governing its evolution.\nHowever, closed-form expressions for the waveform phase can be obtained when\neccentricity is treated as a small parameter, enabling quick waveform\ngeneration. In this paper, closed-form expressions for the GW phasing in the\nform of Taylor approximants up to the eighth power in initial eccentricity\n$(e_0)$ are obtained while also including aligned spins up to the third\npost-Newtonian order. The phasing is obtained in both time and frequency\ndomains. The fully analytical approximant (TaylorT2) is also resummed for usage\nin scenarios where initial eccentricities are as high as 0.5. The frequency\ndomain approximant (TaylorF2) based on Stationary Phase approximation is\ncompared with an existing model (TaylorF2Ecc) to assess the importance of the\nnewly computed eccentric/spinning terms. The findings indicate that for\neccentricities $\\gtrsim 0.15$ (defined at 10 Hz) and small spins $(\\sim 0.2)$,\nthe mismatches can be higher than 1%. This leads to an overall loss in\nsignal-to-noise ratio and lower detection efficiency of GWs coming from\neccentric spinning compact binary inspirals if the combined effects of\neccentricity and aligned spins are neglected in the waveforms.",

We studied the\nprofile changes also using cross-correlation and lag spectra. We re-analysed\nthe energy spectra to search for links between the local features observed in\nthe PFS and spectral emission components associated with the shape of the\nfundamental cyclotron line. In the PFS data, with sufficiently high statistics,\nwe observe a consistent behaviour around the cyclotron line energy.\nSpecifically, two Gaussian-shaped features appear symmetrically on either side\nof the putative cyclotron line. These features exhibit minimal variation with\nsource luminosity, and their peak positions consistently remain on the left and\nright of the cyclotron line energy. Associated with the cyclotron line-forming\nregion, we interpret them as evidence for the resonant cyclotron absorption\nline wings, as predicted by theoretical models of how the cyclotron line\nprofile should appear along the observer's line of sight. A phase-resolved\nanalysis of the pulse in the energy bands surrounding these features enables us\nto determine both the spectral shape and the intensity of the photons\nresponsible for these peaks in the PFS. Assuming these features correspond to a\nspectral component, we used their shapes as priors for the corresponding\nemission components, finding a statistically satisfactory description of the\nspectra.

    "abstract": "Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to continuously introduce novel\ncategories into a classification system without forgetting previously learned\nones, thus adapting to evolving data distributions. Researchers are currently\nfocusing on leveraging the rich semantic information of pre-trained models\n(PTMs) in CIL tasks. Prompt learning has been adopted in CIL for its ability to\nadjust data distribution to better align with pre-trained knowledge. This paper\ncritically examines the limitations of existing methods from the perspective of\nprompt learning, which heavily rely on input information. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel PTM-based CIL method called Input-Agnostic Prompt\nEnhancement with Negative Feedback Regulation (PEARL). In PEARL, we implement\nan input-agnostic global prompt coupled with an adaptive momentum update\nstrategy to reduce the model's dependency on data distribution, thereby\neffectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Guided by negative feedback\nregulation, this adaptive momentum update addresses the parameter sensitivity\ninherent in fixed-weight momentum updates. Furthermore, it fosters the\ncontinuous enhancement of the prompt for new tasks by harnessing correlations\nbetween different tasks in CIL. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that\nour method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/qinyongchun/PEARL.",

A common\ncharacteristic of these methods is that they rely on phasor representation of\noscillation phenomena. This paper takes a different approach by examining the\nactual voltage and current waveforms underlying the phasors. It is found that\nthe presence of interharmonic components is both the necessary and sufficient\ncondition for phasor oscillations. Moreover, the generation and propagation of\ninterharmonic powers are identified as the true culprits behind power system\noscillations and oscillatory instability. Based on these insights, two new\nmethods are developed for locating oscillation sources: one for\nmeasurement-based monitoring applications and another for model-based system\nstudies.

Using a completed SR on Vitamin D and falls (14,439\narticles), the LLM-based system employed prompt engineering for title/abstract\nscreening and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for full-text screening. The\nsystem achieved an article exclusion rate (AER) of 99.5%, specificity of 99.6%,\na false negative rate (FNR) of 0%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of\n100%. After screening, only 78 articles required manual review, including all\n20 identified by traditional methods, reducing manual screening time by 95.5%.\nFor comparison, Rayyan, a commercial tool for title/abstract screening,\nachieved an AER of 72.1% and FNR of 5% when including articles Rayyan\nconsidered as undecided or likely to include. Lowering Rayyan's inclusion\nthresholds improved FNR to 0% but increased screening time. By addressing both\nscreening phases, the LLM-based system significantly outperformed Rayyan and\ntraditional methods, reducing total screening time to 25.5 hours while\nmaintaining high accuracy.

Graph Neural Networks have shown the most promising\nresults in this domain and are currently the de facto standard approach to\nlearning from graph data. However, a key distinction exists between Undirected\nand Directed Link Prediction: the former just predicts the existence of an\nedge, while the latter must also account for edge directionality and\nbidirectionality. This translates to Directed Link Prediction (DLP) having\nthree sub-tasks, each defined by how training, validation and test sets are\nstructured. Most research on DLP overlooks this trichotomy, focusing solely on\nthe \"existence\" sub-task, where training and test sets are random, uncorrelated\nsamples of positive and negative directed edges. Even in the works that\nrecognize the aforementioned trichotomy, models fail to perform well across all\nthree sub-tasks. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that training\nNeural DLP (NDLP) models only on the existence sub-task, using methods adapted\nfrom Neural Undirected Link Prediction, results in parameter configurations\nthat fail to capture directionality and bidirectionality, even after\nrebalancing edge classes. To address this, we propose three strategies that\nhandle the three tasks simultaneously. Our first strategy, the Multi-Class\nFramework for Neural Directed Link Prediction (MC-NDLP) maps NDLP to a\nMulti-Class training objective. The second and third approaches adopt a\nMulti-Task perspective, either with a Multi-Objective (MO-DLP) or a Scalarized\n(S-DLP) strategy. Our results show that these methods outperform traditional\napproaches across multiple datasets and models, achieving equivalent or\nsuperior performance in addressing the three DLP sub-tasks.",

    "abstract": "This research aims to know traffic anomalies as early as possible. A traffic\nanomaly refers to a generic incident on the road that influences traffic flow\nand calls for urgent traffic management measures. `Knowing'' the occurrence of\na traffic anomaly is twofold: the ability to detect this anomaly before it is\nreported anywhere, or it may be such that an anomaly can be predicted before it\nactually occurs on the road (e.g., non-recurrent traffic breakdown). In either\nway, the objective is to inform traffic operators of unreported incidents in\nreal time and as early as possible. The key is to stay ahead of the curve. Time\nis of the essence.\n  Conventional automatic incident detection (AID) methods often struggle with\nearly detection due to their limited consideration of spatial effects and\nearly-stage characteristics. Therefore, we propose a deep learning framework\nutilizing prior domain knowledge and model-designing strategies. This allows\nthe model to detect a broader range of anomalies, not only incidents that\nsignificantly influence traffic flow but also early characteristics of\nincidents along with historically unreported anomalies. We specially design the\nmodel to target the early-stage detection/prediction of an incident.\nAdditionally, unlike most conventional AID studies, our method is highly\nscalable and generalizable, as it is fully automated with no manual selection\nof historical reports required, relies solely on widely available low-cost\ndata, and requires no additional detectors. The experimental results across\nnumerous road segments on different maps demonstrate that our model leads to\nmore effective and early anomaly detection.",

However, existing text-to-image diffusion models often fail\nto maintain high image quality and high prompt-image alignment for those\nchallenging prompts. To mitigate this issue and enhance existing pretrained\ndiffusion models, we mainly made three contributions in this paper. First, we\npropose diffusion self-reflection that alternately performs denoising and\ninversion and demonstrate that such diffusion self-reflection can leverage the\nguidance gap between denoising and inversion to capture prompt-related semantic\ninformation with theoretical and empirical evidence. Second, motivated by\ntheoretical analysis, we derive Zigzag Diffusion Sampling (Z-Sampling), a novel\nself-reflection-based diffusion sampling method that leverages the guidance gap\nbetween denosing and inversion to accumulate semantic information step by step\nalong the sampling path, leading to improved sampling results. Moreover, as a\nplug-and-play method, Z-Sampling can be generally applied to various diffusion\nmodels (e.g., accelerated ones and Transformer-based ones) with very limited\ncoding and computational costs. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat Z-Sampling can generally and significantly enhance generation quality\nacross various benchmark datasets, diffusion models, and performance evaluation\nmetrics. For example, DreamShaper with Z-Sampling can self-improve with the\nHPSv2 winning rate up to 94% over the original results. Moreover, Z-Sampling\ncan further enhance existing diffusion models combined with other orthogonal\nmethods, including Diffusion-DPO.",

    "abstract": "The Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa (GPPV) conjecture is a relationship between two\nthree-manifold invariants: the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) invariant and\nthe \\(\\widehat{Z}\\) (``Z-hat'') invariant. In fact, WRT invariant is defined at\nroots of unity, $\\mathbbm{q}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\ni}{k+2}\\right),~k\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+,~\\text{for}~SU(2)\\right)$, and is generally a\ncomplex number, whereas $\\widehat{Z}$-invariant is a $q$-series with integer\ncoefficients such that $|q|<1$. Therefore, $\\widehat{Z}$-invariant can be\nobtained from WRT-invariant by performing a particular analytic continuation,\n$\\mathbbm{q}\\rightarrow q$. In this thesis, we first examine this conjecture\nfor $SO(3)$ and the ortho-symplectic supergroup $OSp(1|2)$. This is done by\nsetting up the WRT invariant for the respective groups and then performing the\nparticular analytic continuation to extract $\\widehat{Z}$. As a result of this\nexercise, we found that $\\widehat{Z}^{SU(2)}=\\widehat{Z}^{SO(3)}$ and\nidentified a relation between $\\widehat{Z}^{SU(2)}$ and\n$\\widehat{Z}^{OSp(1|2)}$. Motivated by the equality of $\\widehat{Z}$ for\n$SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$ groups, we study this conjecture for $SU(N)/\\mathbb{Z}_m$\ngroups, where $\\mathbb{Z}_m$ is a subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}_N$, in our second\npaper. We subsequently found that\n$\\widehat{Z}^{SU(N)/\\mathbb{Z}_m}=\\widehat{Z}^{SU(N)}$.\n  Another theme of the thesis is to study a conjecture between knot theory and\nquiver representation theory. More precisely, this conjecture relates the\ngenerating function of the symmetric $r$-colored HOMFLY-PT polynomial with the\nmotivic generating series associated with a symmetric quiver. In particular, we\nobtain a quiver representation for a family of knots called double twist knots\n$K(p,-m)$.

    "abstract": "Jammed (mechanically rigid) polydisperse circular-disk packings in two\ndimensions (2D) are popular models for structural glass formers. Maximally\nrandom jammed (MRJ) states, which are the most disordered packings subject to\nstrict jamming, have been shown to be hyperuniform. The characterization of the\nhyperuniformity of MRJ circular-disk packings has covered only a very small\npart of the possible parameter space for the disk-size distributions.\nHyperuniform heterogeneous media are those that anomalously suppress\nlarge-scale volume-fraction fluctuations compared to those in typical\ndisordered systems, i.e., their spectral densities\n$\\tilde{\\chi}_{_V}(\\mathbf{k})$ tend to 0 as the wavenumber\n$k\\equiv|\\mathbf{k}|$ tends to 0 and are described by the power-law\n$\\tilde{\\chi}_{_V}(\\mathbf{k})\\sim k^{\\alpha}$ as $k\\rightarrow0$ where\n$\\alpha$ is the hyperuniformity scaling exponent. In this work, we generate and\ncharacterize the structure of strictly jammed binary circular-disk packings\nwith disk-size ratio $\\beta$ and a molar ratio of 1:1. By characterizing the\nrattler fraction, the fraction of isostatic configurations in an ensemble with\nfixed $\\beta$, and the $n$-fold orientational order metrics of ensembles of\npackings with a wide range of $\\beta$, we show that size ratios $1.2\\lesssim\n\\beta\\lesssim 2.0$ produce MRJ-like states, which we show are the most\ndisordered packings according to several criteria. Using the large-length-scale\nscaling of the volume fraction variance, we extract $\\alpha$ from these\npackings, and find the function $\\alpha(\\beta)$ is maximized at $\\beta$ = 1.4\n(with $\\alpha = 0.450\\pm0.002$) within the range $1.2\\leq\\beta\\leq2.0$, and\ndecreases rapidly outside of this range.

Such plates\ncollected through LPR can then be compared against databases to identify stolen\nvehicles, uninsured drivers, crime suspects, and more. The LPR system plays a\nsignificant role in saving time for institutions such as the police force. In\nthe past, LPR relied heavily on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which has\nbeen widely explored to recognize characters in images. Usually, collected\nplate images suffer from various limitations, including noise, blurring,\nweather conditions, and close characters, making the recognition complex.\nExisting LPR methods still require significant improvement, especially for\ndistorted images.

To address this key\nlimitation, this paper proposes a Bayesian inversion method for ptychography\nthat performs effectively even with less overlap between neighboring scan\nlocations. Furthermore, the proposed method can quantify the inherent\nuncertainty on the ptychographic object, which is created by the ill-posed\nnature of the ptychographic inverse problem.

Our results from\nsimulated ptychography experiments show that the proposed framework can\nconsistently outperform a widely used iterative reconstruction algorithm in\ncases of reduced overlap. Moreover, the proposed framework can provide\nuncertainty estimates that closely correlate with the true error, which is not\navailable in practice. The project website is available here.",

However,\nthe latency grows with the number of users and the model size, impeding the\nsuccessful FL over traditional wireless networks with orthogonal access.\nCell-free massive multiple-input multipleoutput (CFmMIMO) is a promising\nsolution to serve numerous users on the same time/frequency resource with\nsimilar rates. This architecture greatly reduces uplink latency through spatial\nmultiplexing but does not take application characteristics into account. In\nthis paper, we co-optimize the physical layer with the FL application to\nmitigate the straggler effect. We introduce a novel adaptive mixed-resolution\nquantization scheme of the local gradient vector updates, where only the most\nessential entries are given high resolution. Thereafter, we propose a dynamic\nuplink power control scheme to manage the varying user rates and mitigate the\nstraggler effect. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieves test accuracy comparable to classic FL while reducing communication\noverhead by at least 93% on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Fashion-MNIST\ndatasets.

By using the\ninterdependent network approach, we model the key element of the coevolution\nbetween strategy and judgment. In a game layer, agents play public goods game\nby using one of the two major strategies of a social dilemma. In a monitoring\nlayer, supervisors follow the strategy change and may alter the income of\ncompetitors. Fair referees punish defectors while corrupt referees remain\nsilent for a bribe. Importantly, there is a learning process not only among\nplayers but also among referees. Our results suggest that large fines and\nbribes boost the emergence of cooperation by significantly reducing the phase\ntransition threshold between the pure defection state and the mixed solution\nwhere competing strategies coexist.

    "abstract": "Tabular data plays a vital role in various real-world scenarios and finds\nextensive applications. Although recent deep tabular models have shown\nremarkable success, they still struggle to handle data distribution shifts,\nleading to performance degradation when testing distributions change. To remedy\nthis, a robust tabular model must adapt to generalize to unknown distributions\nduring testing. In this paper, we investigate the problem of fully test-time\nadaptation (FTTA) for tabular data, where the model is adapted using only the\ntesting data. We identify three key challenges: the existence of label and\ncovariate distribution shifts, the lack of effective data augmentation, and the\nsensitivity of adaptation, which render existing FTTA methods ineffective for\ntabular data. To this end, we propose the Fully Test-time Adaptation for\nTabular data, namely FTAT, which enables FTTA methods to robustly optimize the\nlabel distribution of predictions, adapt to shifted covariate distributions,\nand suit a variety of tasks and models effectively. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on six benchmark datasets, which are evaluated using three metrics.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that FTAT outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods by a margin.",

    "abstract": "Timely detection and geolocation of events based on social data can provide\ncritical information for applications such as crisis response and resource\nallocation. However, most existing methods are greatly affected by event\ndetection errors, leading to insufficient geolocation accuracy. To this end,\nthis paper proposes a novel end-to-end event geolocation method (GTOP)\nleveraging Hyperbolic space and toponym hierarchies. Specifically, the proposed\nmethod contains one event detection module and one geolocation module. The\nevent detection module constructs a heterogeneous information networks based on\nsocial data, and then constructs a homogeneous message graph and combines it\nwith the text and time feature of the message to learning initial features of\nnodes. Node features are updated in Hyperbolic space and then fed into a\nclassifier for event detection. To reduce the geolocation error, this paper\nproposes a noise toponym filtering algorithm (HIST) based on the hierarchical\nstructure of toponyms. HIST analyzes the hierarchical structure of toponyms\nmentioned in the event cluster, taking the highly frequent city-level locations\nas the coarse-grained locations for events. By comparing the hierarchical\nstructure of the toponyms within the cluster against those of the\ncoarse-grained locations of events, HIST filters out noisy toponyms. To further\nimprove the geolocation accuracy, we propose a fine-grained pseudo toponyms\ngeneration algorithm (FIT) based on the output of HIST, and combine generated\npseudo toponyms with filtered toponyms to locate events based on the geographic\ncenter points of the combined toponyms.

    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) is a highly relevant setting gaining traction in\nrecent machine learning research. Among CL works, architectural and hybrid\nstrategies are particularly effective due to their potential to adapt the model\narchitecture as new tasks are presented. However, many existing solutions do\nnot efficiently exploit model sparsity, and are prone to capacity saturation\ndue to their inefficient use of available weights, which limits the number of\nlearnable tasks. In this paper, we propose TinySubNets (TSN), a novel\narchitectural CL strategy that addresses the issues through the unique\ncombination of pruning with different sparsity levels, adaptive quantization,\nand weight sharing. Pruning identifies a subset of weights that preserve model\nperformance, making less relevant weights available for future tasks. Adaptive\nquantization allows a single weight to be separated into multiple parts which\ncan be assigned to different tasks. Weight sharing between tasks boosts the\nexploitation of capacity and task similarity, allowing for the identification\nof a better trade-off between model accuracy and capacity. These features allow\nTSN to efficiently leverage the available capacity, enhance knowledge transfer,\nand reduce computational resource consumption. Experimental results involving\ncommon benchmark CL datasets and scenarios show that our proposed strategy\nachieves better results in terms of accuracy than existing state-of-the-art CL\nstrategies.

Second, correlations among\nchannels are complex and intertwined, making it hard to model the interactions\namong channels precisely and flexibly.\n  In this study, we address these challenges by proposing a general framework\ncalled DUET, which introduces dual clustering on the temporal and channel\ndimensions to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. First, we design a\nTemporal Clustering Module (TCM) that clusters time series into fine-grained\ndistributions to handle heterogeneous temporal patterns. For different\ndistribution clusters, we design various pattern extractors to capture their\nintrinsic temporal patterns, thus modeling the heterogeneity. Second, we\nintroduce a novel Channel-Soft-Clustering strategy and design a Channel\nClustering Module (CCM), which captures the relationships among channels in the\nfrequency domain through metric learning and applies sparsification to mitigate\nthe adverse effects of noisy channels. Finally, DUET combines TCM and CCM to\nincorporate both the temporal and channel dimensions.

This model defines four types of\ntags that reflect the relationships between characters, and proposes a\nfine-grained modeling of the relationships between characters based on three\ntypes of relationships: adjacency relations between characters, relations\nbetween characters and tags, and relations between tags, to more accurately\nidentify entity boundaries and improve Chinese NER accuracy. Specifically, we\ntransform the Chinese NER task into a character-character relationship\nclassification task, ensuring the accuracy of entity boundary recognition\nthrough joint modeling of relation tags. To enhance the model's ability to\nunderstand contextual information, WRENER further constructed an adapted\ntransformer encoder that combines unscaled direction-aware and distance-aware\nmasked self-attention mechanisms.

Experimental results demonstrate the model's\neffectiveness, achieving 98.53%, 96.10%, and 95.92% accuracy on training,\nvalidation, and test sets, respectively. In noisy conditions, the proposed\napproach improves recognition by 26.88% over phoneme unit-based LSTM models and\nsurpasses the Mel-scale Two Dimension Root Cepstrum Coefficients (MTDRCC)\nfeature extraction technique along with MLP model (MTDRCC+MLP) by 7.61%.",

This paper introduces Riemannian Flow\nMatching Policy (RFMP), a model that inherits the easy training and fast\ninference capabilities of flow matching (FM). Moreover, RFMP inherently\nincorporates geometric constraints commonly found in realistic robotic\napplications, as the robot state resides on a Riemannian manifold.

Since demand charges are\nincurred monthly, EMPC requires a full-month reference trajectory for\nasymptotic stability guarantees that result in optimal operating costs.\nHowever, a full-month reference trajectory is unrealistic from a renewable\ngeneration forecast perspective. Therefore, to construct a practical EMPC with\na reference trajectory, an EMPC formulation considering both non-coincident\ndemand and on-peak demand charges is designed in this work for 24 to 48 h\nprediction horizons. The corresponding reference trajectory is computed at each\nEMPC step by solving an optimal control problem over 24 to 48 h reference\n(trajectory) horizon. Furthermore, BESS state of charge regulation constraints\nare incorporated to guarantee the BESS energy level in the long term.

However, those manually collected images\noften exhibit bias, which is non-transferable across either categories or\ndomains, thus causing the model's generalization capacity degeneration. To\nmitigate this problem, we present a low-biased general annotated dataset\ngeneration framework (lbGen). Instead of expensive manual collection, we aim at\ndirectly generating low-biased images with category annotations. To achieve\nthis goal, we propose to leverage the advantage of a multimodal foundation\nmodel (e.g., CLIP), in terms of aligning images in a low-biased semantic space\ndefined by language. Specifically, we develop a bi-level semantic alignment\nloss, which not only forces all generated images to be consistent with the\nsemantic distribution of all categories belonging to the target dataset in an\nadversarial learning manner, but also requires each generated image to match\nthe semantic description of its category name. In addition, we further cast an\nexisting image quality scoring model into a quality assurance loss to preserve\nthe quality of the generated image. By leveraging these two loss functions, we\ncan obtain a low-biased image generation model by simply fine-tuning a\npre-trained diffusion model using only all category names in the target dataset\nas input. Experimental results confirm that, compared with the manually labeled\ndataset or other synthetic datasets, the utilization of our generated\nlow-biased dataset leads to stable generalization capacity enhancement of\ndifferent backbone networks across various tasks, especially in tasks where the\nmanually labeled samples are scarce.",

    "abstract": "Fuzzy (wave) dark matter (FDM), the dynamical model underlying an ultralight\nbosonic dark matter species, produces a rich set of non-gravitational\nsignatures that distinguishes it markedly from the phenomenologically related\nwarm (particle) dark matter (WDM) scenario. The emergence of extended\ninterference fringes hosted by cosmic filaments is one such phenomenon reported\nby cosmological simulations, and a detailed understanding of such may\nstrengthen existing limits on the boson mass but also break the degeneracy with\nWDM, and provide a unique fingerprint of interference in cosmology. In this\npaper, we provide initial steps towards this goal. In particular, we show in a\nbottom-up approach, how the presence of interference in an idealised filament\npopulation can lead to a non-suppressive feature in the matter power spectrum\n-- an observation supported by fully-cosmological FDM simulations. To this end,\nwe build on a theoretically motivated and numerically observed steady-state\napproximation for filaments and express the equilibrium dynamics of such in an\nexpansion of FDM eigenstates. We optimise the size of the expansion by\nincorporating classical phase-space information. Ellipsoidal collapse\nconsiderations are used to construct a fuzzy filament mass function which,\ntogether with the reconstructed FDM wave function, allow us to efficiently\ncompute the one-filament power spectrum. We showcase our non-perturbative\ninterference model for a selection of boson masses and confirm our approach is\nable to produce the matter power boost observed in fully-cosmological FDM\nsimulations. More precisely, we find an excess in correlation between the\nspatial scale associated with the FDM ground state and the quantum pressure\nscale. We speculate about applications of this effect in data analysis.",

    "abstract": "O-stars generally show clear signs of strong line-broadening (in addition to\nrotational broadening) in their photospheric absorption lines (typically\nreferred to as 'macroturbulence'), believed to originate in a turbulent\nsub-surface zone associated with enhanced opacities due to recombination of\niron-group elements (at T~ 150-200 kK). O-stars with detected global magnetic\nfields also display such macroturbulence; the sole exception to this is NGC\n1624-2, which also has the strongest (by far) detected field of the known\nmagnetic O-stars. It has been suggested that this lack of additional\nline-broadening is because NGC 1624-2's exceptionally strong magnetic field\nmight be able able to suppress the turbulent velocity field generated in the\niron opacity peak zone. For moderately strong magnetic cases (~1 kG) the\nsimulated atmospheres are highly structured characterised by large\nroot-mean-square velocities, and our results are qualitatively similar to those\nfound in previous non-magnetic studies. By contrast, we find that a strong\nhorizontal magnetic field in excess of 10 kG can indeed suppress the large\nvelocity fluctuations and thus stabilise (and thereby also inflate) the\natmosphere of a typical early O-star in the Galaxy. On the other hand, an\nequally strong radial field is only able to suppress horizontal motions, and as\na consequence these models exhibit significant radial fluctuations. Our\nsimulations provide an overall physical rationale as to why NGC 1624-2 with its\nstrong ~20 kG dipolar field lacks the large macroturbulent line broadening that\nall other known slowly rotating early O-stars exhibit. However, they also\nhighlight the importance of field geometry for controlling the atmospheric\ndynamics in massive and luminous stars that are strongly magnetic, tentatively\nsuggesting latitudinal dependence of macroturbulence and basic photospheric\nparameters.",

The Expert-ML method achieved high accuracy results in\nsimulation data and real-world data with normal sampling rate. However, this\napproach lacks of generality as it requires domain expertise and its\nperformance degraded significantly when data sampling rate varied. To achieve\ngenerality, we propose a novel diffusion-based PoL identification method.\nDistinct from prior approaches, the proposed method leverages a diffusion model\nto achieve end-to-end identification without manual refinement or\ndomain-specific knowledge. Specifically, we employ a multivariate time-series\nencoder to capture hidden representations of satellite positional data. The\nencoded features are subsequently incorporated as conditional information in\nthe denoising process to generate PoL labels. Through experimentation across\nreal-world satellite settings, our proposed diffusion-based method demonstrates\nits high identification quality and provides a robust solution even with\nreduced data sampling rates, indicating its great potential in practical\nsatellite behavior pattern identification, tracking and related mission\ndeployment.",

In this work, some sufficient and necessary\nconditions for observability maintenance are first proved. We find that under\ncertain conditions, an EKF can naturally maintain correct observability if the\ncorresponding linearization makes unobservable subspace independent of the\nstate values. Based on this theoretical finding, a novel affine EKF (Aff-EKF)\nframework is proposed to overcome the inconsistency of standard EKF (Std-EKF)\nby affine transformations, which not only naturally satisfies the observability\nconstraint but also has a clear design procedure. The advantages of our Aff-EKF\nframework over some commonly used methods are demonstrated through mathematical\nanalyses. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated on three\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) applications with different types\nof features, typical point features, point features on a horizontal plane and\nplane features. Specifically, following the proposed procedure, the naturally\nconsistent Aff-EKFs can be explicitly derived for these problems.

The\nHamiltonian of the system has a form of the extended Hubbard model (at the\natomic limit) with nearest-neighbor Ising-like magnetic $J$ interactions and\nonsite Coulomb $U$ interactions. The model is investigated for both signs of\n$J$, arbitrary $U$ interaction and arbitrary chemical potential $\\mu$ (or,\nequivalently, arbitrary particle concentration $n$). Based on the specific heat\ncapacity and sublattice magnetization analyses, the phase diagrams of the model\nare determined. For ferromagnetic case ($J<0$), the transition from the ordered\nphase (which is a standard ferromagnet and can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J|\n\\approx 0.61$) is found to be second-order (for sufficiently large temperatures\n$k_{B}T/|J| \\gtrsim 0.2$) or first-order (for $-1<U/|J|<-0.65$ at the\nhalf-filling, i.e., $n=1$). In the case of $J>0$, the ordered phase occurs in a\nrange of $-1/2<U/|J|<0$ (for $n=1$), while for larger $U$ the state with\nshort-range order is also found (also for $n \\neq 1$).

The transition from this ordered\nphase, which is found also for $\\mu \\neq 0$ ($n \\neq 1$) and $U/|J|>-1/2$ is\nalways second-order for any model parameters.

By harnessing the advanced\nreasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge embedded in LLMs, these\napplications can generate detailed action plans that are subsequently executed\nby external tools. Furthermore, the integration of retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) enhances performance by incorporating up-to-date,\ndomain-specific knowledge into the planning and execution processes. This\napproach has seen widespread adoption across various sectors, including\nhealthcare, finance, and software development. Meanwhile, there are also\ngrowing concerns regarding the security of LLM-based applications. Researchers\nhave disclosed various attacks, represented by jailbreak and prompt injection,\nto hijack the output actions of these applications. Existing attacks mainly\nfocus on crafting semantically harmful prompts, and their validity could\ndiminish when security filters are employed. In this paper, we introduce\nAI$\\mathbf{^2}$, a novel attack to manipulate the action plans of LLM-based\napplications. Different from existing solutions, the innovation of\nAI$\\mathbf{^2}$ lies in leveraging the knowledge from the application's\ndatabase to facilitate the construction of malicious but semantically-harmless\nprompts. To this end, it first collects action-aware knowledge from the victim\napplication. Based on such knowledge, the attacker can generate misleading\ninput, which can mislead the LLM to generate harmful action plans, while\nbypassing possible detection mechanisms easily.

    "abstract": "Decision-making in large-scale games is an essential research area in\nartificial intelligence (AI) with significant real-world impact. However, the\nlimited access to realistic large-scale game environments has hindered research\nprogress in this area. In this paper, we present AuctionNet, a benchmark for\nbid decision-making in large-scale ad auctions derived from a real-world online\nadvertising platform. AuctionNet is composed of three parts: an ad auction\nenvironment, a pre-generated dataset based on the environment, and performance\nevaluations of several baseline bid decision-making algorithms. More\nspecifically, the environment effectively replicates the integrity and\ncomplexity of real-world ad auctions through the interaction of several\nmodules: the ad opportunity generation module employs deep generative networks\nto bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data while mitigating the\nrisk of sensitive data exposure; the bidding module implements diverse\nauto-bidding agents trained with different decision-making algorithms; and the\nauction module is anchored in the classic Generalized Second Price (GSP)\nauction but also allows for customization of auction mechanisms as needed. To\nfacilitate research and provide insights into the environment, we have also\npre-generated a substantial dataset based on the environment. The dataset\ncontains 10 million ad opportunities, 48 diverse auto-bidding agents, and over\n500 million auction records. Performance evaluations of baseline algorithms\nsuch as linear programming, reinforcement learning, and generative models for\nbid decision-making are also presented as a part of AuctionNet. We believe that\nAuctionNet is applicable not only to research on bid decision-making in ad\nauctions but also to the general area of decision-making in large-scale games.",

This may lead to an erroneous description of\nthe lattice thermal conductivity, which plays a crucial role in the\nthermoelectric efficiency, and for which there exists a significant discrepancy\nbetween ideal theoretical values and available experimental measurements. In\nthis article, we employ a combination of density-functional theory (DFT) and\nmachine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to investigate how intrinsic\ndefects affect the phonon spectra and lattice thermal conductivity of TaFeSb,\nalongside its electronic structure. The calculation of the formation energies\nof various defects identifies Fe interstitial atoms sitting at the vacant side\nof the HH crystal structure as the most likely to form, immediately followed by\nSb substitution at Ta sites and by other antisite configurations. Phonon\ncalculations illustrate that both defects generate localized phonon modes that\nsignificantly lower the lattice thermal conductivity, especially around room\ntemperature. This reduction aligns the calculated values with available\nmeasurements, underscoring the critical role of intrinsic defects in\nreconciling the existing discrepancies between theory and experiment. Our\nfindings also reveal that these defects introduce localized electronic states,\neffectively reducing the theoretical electronic band gap and bringing it closer\nto the experimentally observed values.

    "abstract": "A new mechanism of enhanced laser energy absorption in plasma microglobules\nis demonstrated with the help of two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC)\nsimulations. The mechanism relies on the excitation of surface and bulk waves\nand the occurrence of repeated collisions in the confines of the finite-sized\nmicroglobular target. The episodic increase in the average particle energy\ncorrelates with the repeated collision of the surface and bulk waves that get\nexcited by the laser on the target. It is shown that the size of the\nmicroglobular target governs the efficiency of absorption and the timings of\nepisodic events of energy enhancement. This study thereby illustrates the novel\nefficient possibility that a closed plasma target provides for energy\nextraction. Parallels of such colliding waves creating havoc in terms of wave\nbreaking etc. can be witnessed on the ocean surface, seismic disturbances\ntraversing as body waves traverse reflecting and refracting in the interior of\nthe Earth along with surface waves (propagating on the curved surface of the\nEarth) converge at the antipode to create destruction. Our studies here show\nthe importance of choosing closed targets which aid in the process of repeated\nenergy transfer to particles and often their thermalization. The waves keep\npropagating in the closed confines rather than getting dissipated over an\nextended region as would happen for extended targets.",

Queries delineate user needs at an abstract\nlevel, providing a high-level description, whereas items operate on a more\nspecific and concrete level, representing the granular facets of user\npreference. While practical, both query and item recommendations encounter the\nchallenge of sparse user feedback. To this end, we propose a novel approach\nnamed Multiple-round Auto Guess-and-Update System (MAGUS) that capitalizes on\nthe synergies between both types, allowing us to leverage both query and item\ninformation to form user interests. This integrated system introduces a\nrecursive framework that could be applied to any recommendation method to\nexploit queries and items in historical interactions and to provide\nrecommendations for both queries and items in each interaction round. Empirical\nresults from testing 12 different recommendation methods demonstrate that\nintegrating queries into item recommendations via MAGUS significantly enhances\nthe efficiency, with which users can identify their preferred items during\nmultiple-round interactions.",

We derive an upper bound for the discretization error\nof the sampling schedule, which can be efficiently optimized with Monte-Carlo\nestimation.

Existing methods often struggle to\ngenerate descendants with both high diversity and fidelity while precisely\ncontrolling facial attributes such as age and gender. To address these issues,\nwe propose the Style Latent Diffusion Transformer (StyleDiT), a novel framework\nthat integrates the strengths of StyleGAN with the diffusion model to generate\nhigh-quality and diverse kinship faces. In this framework, the rich facial\npriors of StyleGAN enable fine-grained attribute control, while our conditional\ndiffusion model is used to sample a StyleGAN latent aligned with the kinship\nrelationship of conditioning images by utilizing the advantage of modeling\ncomplex kinship relationship distribution. StyleGAN then handles latent\ndecoding for final face generation. Additionally, we introduce the Relational\nTrait Guidance (RTG) mechanism, enabling independent control of influencing\nconditions, such as each parent's facial image. RTG also enables a fine-grained\nadjustment between the diversity and fidelity in synthesized faces.\nFurthermore, we extend the application to an unexplored domain: predicting a\npartner's facial images using a child's image and one parent's image within the\nsame framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our StyleDiT outperforms\nexisting methods by striking an excellent balance between generating diverse\nand high-fidelity kinship faces.",

These challenges\ninclude operating under limited computational resources, adapting to new\ndrivers, and changes in driving behavior over time. The objective of this study\nis to evaluate if Continual Learning (CL) is well-suited to address these\nchallenges, as it enables models to retain previously learned knowledge while\ncontinually adapting with minimal computational overhead and resource\nrequirements.

Our novel method, SmooDER, achieves optimal\nresults with only a 2% reduction compared to the 11\\% of the DER approach.

Each task performs its duties, and they\ntogether enable the model to make full use of both action-free videos and\nreward-free interactions for robust dynamics understanding and advanced action\nprediction. Simultaneously, UPESV clones a policy from the labeled expert\nvideos, in turn collecting environmental interactions for self-supervised\ntasks. After a sample-efficient, unsupervised, and iterative training process,\nUPESV obtains an advanced policy based on a robust video labeling model.\nExtensive experiments in sixteen challenging procedurally generated\nenvironments demonstrate that the proposed UPESV achieves state-of-the-art\ninteraction-limited policy learning performance (outperforming five current\nadvanced baselines on 12/16 tasks) without exposure to any other supervision\nexcept for videos.",

We find that in a strong decay\n$D^{*}\\rightarrow{D}{\\pi}$, the non-relativistic contribution is dominant,\nwhile in an electromagnetic decay ${D^{*}\\rightarrow{D}\\gamma}$, the\nrelativistic correction is dominant.",

This approach enables wheeled robots to\nachieve both simultaneous reconfiguration and omnidirectional mobility.\nAdditionally, a prototype was developed to validate the ODD, followed by\nkinematic analysis.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in audio generation have focused on text-to-audio (T2A) and\nvideo-to-audio (V2A) tasks. However, T2A or V2A methods cannot generate\nholistic sounds (onscreen and off-screen). This is because T2A cannot generate\nsounds aligning with onscreen objects, while V2A cannot generate semantically\ncomplete (offscreen sounds missing). In this work, we address the task of\nholistic audio generation: given a video and a text prompt, we aim to generate\nboth onscreen and offscreen sounds that are temporally synchronized with the\nvideo and semantically aligned with text and video. Previous approaches for\njoint text and video-to-audio generation often suffer from modality bias,\nfavoring one modality over the other. To overcome this limitation, we introduce\nVinTAGe, a flow-based transformer model that jointly considers text and video\nto guide audio generation. Our framework comprises two key components: a\nVisual-Text Encoder and a Joint VT-SiT model. To reduce modality bias and\nimprove generation quality, we employ pretrained uni-modal text-to-audio and\nvideo-to-audio generation models for additional guidance. Due to the lack of\nappropriate benchmarks, we also introduce VinTAGe-Bench, a dataset of 636\nvideo-text-audio pairs containing both onscreen and offscreen sounds. Our\ncomprehensive experiments on VinTAGe-Bench demonstrate that joint text and\nvisual interaction is necessary for holistic audio generation. Furthermore,\nVinTAGe achieves state-of-the-art results on the VGGSound benchmark. Our source\ncode and pre-trained models will be released.

Most network tomography\nalgorithms employ conventional threshold-based methods to identify congestion\nalong paths, while these methods encounter limitations stemming from network\ncomplexities, resulting in inaccuracies such as misidentifying abnormal links\nand overlooking congestion attacks, thereby impeding algorithm performance.\nThis paper introduces the concept of Additive Congestion Status to address\nthese challenges effectively. Using a framework that combines Adversarial\nAutoencoders (AAE) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, this approach\nrobustly categorizes (as uncongested, single-congested, or multiple-congested)\nand quantifies (regarding the number of congested links) the Additive\nCongestion Status. Leveraging prior path information and capturing\nspatio-temporal characteristics of probing flows, this method significantly\nenhances the localization of congested links and the inference of link\nperformance compared to conventional network tomography algorithms, as\ndemonstrated through experimental evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language retrieval aims to search for similar instances in one\nmodality based on queries from another modality. The primary objective is to\nlearn cross-modal matching representations in a latent common space. Actually,\nthe assumption underlying cross-modal matching is modal balance, where each\nmodality contains sufficient information to represent the others. However,\nnoise interference and modality insufficiency often lead to modal imbalance,\nmaking it a common phenomenon in practice. The impact of imbalance on retrieval\nperformance remains an open question. In this paper, we first demonstrate that\nultimate cross-modal matching is generally sub-optimal for cross-modal\nretrieval when imbalanced modalities exist. The structure of instances in the\ncommon space is inherently influenced when facing imbalanced modalities, posing\na challenge to cross-modal similarity measurement. To address this issue, we\nemphasize the importance of meaningful structure-preserved matching.\nAccordingly, we propose a simple yet effective method to rebalance cross-modal\nmatching by learning structure-preserved matching representations.\nSpecifically, we design a novel multi-granularity cross-modal matching that\nincorporates structure-aware distillation alongside the cross-modal matching\nloss. While the cross-modal matching loss constraints instance-level matching,\nthe structure-aware distillation further regularizes the geometric consistency\nbetween learned matching representations and intra-modal representations\nthrough the developed relational matching. Extensive experiments on different\ndatasets affirm the superior cross-modal retrieval performance of our approach,\nsimultaneously enhancing single-modal retrieval capabilities compared to the\nbaseline models.",

These UDGs display blue\npseudo-bulges with S\\'ersic indices $n<2.5$ and effective radii spanning\n300-700 pc, along with bluer thin stellar disks exhibiting low surface\nbrightness and expansive effective radii that align with the UDG definition.\nThe rotation velocities of these UDGs, determined using HI line widths and\noptical inclinations, exceed those of most dwarf galaxies of similar mass,\nsuggesting the high halo spins or substantial dark matter halos. We propose\nthat these UDGs likely formed through mergers of dwarf galaxies lacking old\nstars in their progenitors, resulting in the development of central bulge-like\nstructures during starbursts triggered by the mergers, while also enhancing\ntheir halo spin. Subsequent gas accretion facilitated the formation of extended\nstellar disks. It is also worth noting the possibility that these UDGs could\nalternatively represent ``failed $L^{\\star}$ galaxies'' with massive dark\nmatter halos but reduced star formation efficiencies. If future high-resolution\nHI observations confirm the presence of massive halos around these UDGs, they\nmay have formed due to intense AGN feedback in the early universe, and may be\nthe descendants of ``little red dots'' observed by the James Webb Space\nTelescope, which are characterized by heightened central black hole masses and\nintensified accretion and feedback processes in the early universe.",

Additionally, a significant anti-correlation was detected between\n$\\log \\nu_{\\mathrm{p}}$ and $b$, with a slope of 5.79 in the relation between\n$1/b$ and $\\log \\nu_{\\mathrm{p}}$, closer to the prediction from a statistical\nacceleration model other than a stochastic acceleration interpretation, though\na notable discrepancy persists. This discrepancy indicates that additional\nfactors, such as deviations from idealized conditions or radiative\ncontributions-such as thermal emission from the accretion disk in the\noptical-UV range during quiescent states-may play a role in producing the\nobserved steeper slope. Within the framework of statistical acceleration\nmechanism, lack of correlation between change in peak intensity and change in\npeak frequency suggests that change in electron energy distribution is unlikely\nto be responsible for the time-dependent SED changes.

The $p$-mean regret, defined as the difference\nbetween the optimal mean among the arms and the $p$-mean of the expected\nrewards, offers a flexible framework for evaluating bandit algorithms, enabling\nalgorithm designers to balance fairness and efficiency by adjusting the\nparameter $p$. Our framework encompasses both average cumulative regret and\nNash regret as special cases.\n  We introduce a simple, unified UCB-based algorithm (Explore-Then-UCB) that\nachieves novel $p$-mean regret bounds. Our algorithm consists of two phases: a\ncarefully calibrated uniform exploration phase to initialize sample means,\nfollowed by the UCB1 algorithm of Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, and Fischer (2002). Under\nmild assumptions, we prove that our algorithm achieves a $p$-mean regret bound\nof $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{T^{\\frac{1}{2|p|}}}}\\right)$ for all $p \\leq\n-1$, where $k$ represents the number of arms and $T$ the time horizon.

For the range\n$0< p \\leq 1$, we achieve a $p$-mean regret scaling as\n$\\tilde{O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{T}}\\right)$, which matches the previously\nestablished lower bound up to logarithmic factors (Auer et al. 1995). This\nresult stems from the fact that the $p$-mean regret of any algorithm is at\nleast its average cumulative regret for $p \\leq 1$.\n  In the case of Nash regret (the limit as $p$ approaches zero), our unified\napproach differs from prior work (Barman et al. 2023), which requires a new\nNash Confidence Bound algorithm.

It begins with a Motion-driven Key Patch Tracking (M-KPT) module, which\nrelies on visual motion information to identify salient visual patches with\nsignificant movements that are more likely to relate to sounding objects and\nquestions. We measure the patch-wise motion intensity map between neighboring\nvideo frames and utilize it to construct and guide a motion-driven graph\nnetwork.

This module also involves a graph network, with the\nadjacency matrix regularized by the audio-visual correspondence map. The M-KPT\nand S-KPT modules are performed in parallel for each temporal segment, allowing\nbalanced tracking of salient and sounding objects.

Although a plethora of works deal\nwith event extraction from new articles, clinical text etc., only a few works\nfocus on event extraction from literary content. Detecting events in short\nstories presents several challenges to current systems, encompassing a\ndifferent distribution of events as compared to other domains and the portrayal\nof diverse emotional conditions. This paper presents \\texttt{Vrittanta-EN}, a\ncollection of 1000 English short stories annotated for real events. Exploring\nthis field could result in the creation of techniques and resources that\nsupport literary scholars in improving their effectiveness. This could\nsimultaneously influence the field of Natural Language Processing. Our\nobjective is to clarify the intricate idea of events in the context of short\nstories. Towards the objective, we collected 1,000 short stories written mostly\nfor children in the Indian context. Further, we present fresh guidelines for\nannotating event mentions and their categories, organized into \\textit{seven\ndistinct classes}. The classes are {\\tt{COGNITIVE-MENTAL-STATE(CMS),\nCOMMUNICATION(COM), CONFLICT(CON), GENERAL-ACTIVITY(GA), LIFE-EVENT(LE),\nMOVEMENT(MOV), and OTHERS(OTH)}}.

    "abstract": "The Directed Steiner Tree (DST) problem is defined on a directed graph\n$G=(V,E)$, where we are given a designated root vertex $r$ and a set of $k$\nterminals $K \\subseteq V \\setminus {r}$. The goal is to find a minimum-cost\nsubgraph that provides directed $r \\rightarrow t$ paths for all terminals $t\n\\in K$.\n  The approximability of DST has long been a central open problem in network\ndesign. Although there exist polylogarithmic-approximation algorithms with\nquasi-polynomial running times (Charikar et al. 1998; Grandoni, Laekhanukit,\nand Li 2019; Ghuge and Nagarajan 2020), the best-known polynomial-time\napproximation until now has remained at $k^\\epsilon$ for any constant $\\epsilon\n> 0$. Whether a polynomial-time algorithm achieving a polylogarithmic\napproximation exists has been a longstanding mystery.\n  In this paper, we resolve this question by presenting a polynomial-time\nalgorithm that achieves an $O(\\log^3 k)$-approximation for DST on arbitrary\ndirected graphs. This result nearly matches the state-of-the-art $O(\\log^2 k /\n\\log\\log k)$ approximations known only via quasi-polynomial-time algorithms.\nThe resulting gap -- $O(\\log^3 k)$ versus $O(\\log^2 k / \\log\\log k)$ -- mirrors\nthe known complexity landscape for the Group Steiner Tree problem. This\nparallel suggests intriguing new directions: Is there a hardness result that\nprovably separates the power of polynomial-time and quasi-polynomial-time\nalgorithms for DST?",

To address these challenges, we propose RegMixMatch, a\nnovel framework that optimizes the use of Mixup with both high- and\nlow-confidence samples in SSL.

Although the photodiode is\ndesigned for detecting the position of incident light and optimized for use in\nthe UV region, we present evidence that it also performs well as a detector for\nions, with energies in the MeV range. The device consists of a uniform p-type\nlayer formed on a high-resistivity n-type semiconductor substrate, a pair of\nelectrodes on both ends of the resistive layer, and a common electrode located\non the backside of the substrate. The IBIC experiment was carried out at the\nLaboratory for Ion Beam Interaction (LIBI) of the Ruder Boskovic Institute in\nZagreb (HR), using 2 MeV proton microbeam raster scanning the 2.5x0.6 mm2\nactive area of the PSD. Each of the three electrodes was connected to\nindependent standard NIM charge-sensitive electronic chain and the induced\ncharge pulses associated with the position of individual ions were then\ndigitized using a multi-channel analyzer interfaced with the SPECTOR software.\nThe longitudinal Charge Collection Efficiency (CCE) profiles acquired from the\ntop electrodes show linear behaviors with opposite slopes, whereas the profile\nrelevant to the signals from the back electrode is almost constant. A model\nbased on the IBIC theory satisfactorily interprets these results. It offers an\nalternative viewpoint to the commonly adopted Lateral Effect Photodiode\nprinciple and paves the way for the development of new PSDs for the\nidentification of the impact position of a MeV ion with a resolution at the\nmicrometer scale.",

We first model the behaviour of the smart\nhome and its requirements as a logic program in Answer Set Programming (ASP).\nWe then apply Z-Score thresholding to the anomaly scores of an Isolation Forest\ntrained using unlabeled data to simulate unknown attack scenarios. Finally, we\nencode the network anomaly in the logic program and perform abduction by\nrefutation to identify the class of attack and the security requirements that\nthis anomaly may violate. We demonstrate our technique using a smart home\nscenario, where we detect and diagnose anomalies in network traffic.

Due to the crowded spectrum occupancy and\ndense user terminals (UTs), the conventional fixed antenna (FA)-based access\npoints (APs) face huge challenges in realizing massive access and interference\ncancellation. To address this issue, in this paper we develop a six-dimensional\nmovable antenna (6DMA) enhanced multi-AP coordination system for coverage\nenhancement and interference mitigation. First, we model the wireless channels\nbetween the APs and UTs to characterize their variation with respect to 6DMA\nmovement, in terms of both the three-dimensional (3D) position and 3D\norientation of each distributed AP's antenna. Then, an optimization problem is\nformulated to maximize the weighted sum rate of multiple UTs for their uplink\ntransmissions by jointly optimizing the antenna position vector (APV), the\nantenna orientation matrix (AOM), and the receive combining matrix over all\ncoordinated APs, subject to the constraints on local antenna movement regions.\nTo solve this challenging non-convex optimization problem, we first transform\nit into a more tractable Lagrangian dual problem. Then, an alternating\noptimization (AO)-based algorithm is developed by iteratively optimizing the\nAPV and AOM, which are designed by applying the successive convex approximation\n(SCA) technique and Riemannian manifold optimization-based algorithm,\nrespectively. Simulation results show that the proposed 6DMA-enhanced multi-AP\ncoordination system can significantly enhance network capacity, and both of the\nonline and offline 6DMA schemes can attain considerable performance improvement\ncompared to the conventional FA-based schemes.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of deep learning has intensified the need for\ncomprehensive data for use by autonomous driving algorithms. High-quality\ndatasets are crucial for the development of effective data-driven autonomous\ndriving solutions. Next-generation autonomous driving datasets must be\nmultimodal, incorporating data from advanced sensors that feature extensive\ndata coverage, detailed annotations, and diverse scene representation. To\naddress this need, we present OmniHD-Scenes, a large-scale multimodal dataset\nthat provides comprehensive omnidirectional high-definition data. The\nOmniHD-Scenes dataset combines data from 128-beam LiDAR, six cameras, and six\n4D imaging radar systems to achieve full environmental perception. The dataset\ncomprises 1501 clips, each approximately 30-s long, totaling more than 450K\nsynchronized frames and more than 5.85 million synchronized sensor data points.\nWe also propose a novel 4D annotation pipeline. To date, we have annotated 200\nclips with more than 514K precise 3D bounding boxes. These clips also include\nsemantic segmentation annotations for static scene elements. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel automated pipeline for generation of the dense occupancy\nground truth, which effectively leverages information from non-key frames.\nAlongside the proposed dataset, we establish comprehensive evaluation metrics,\nbaseline models, and benchmarks for 3D detection and semantic occupancy\nprediction. These benchmarks utilize surround-view cameras and 4D imaging radar\nto explore cost-effective sensor solutions for autonomous driving applications.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our low-cost sensor\nconfiguration and its robustness under adverse conditions.

On the other hand, we prove that, except\nfor point formation (Gathering), UPF is solvable under any sequential scheduler\nwithout any additional assumptions. We then turn our attention to the Gathering\nproblem, and prove that weak multiplicity detection is necessary and sufficient\nfor solvability under sequential schedulers.

We\npropose to break this degeneracy by using multiple optically-thin molecular\nlines as a dust-albedo independent thermometer. In practice, we employ\npressure-broadened CO line wings that provide an exceptionally high\nsignal-to-noise ratio as an optically thin line.

Combining multi-band continuum\nobservations, we constrain the albedo spectrum at $0.9-3$ mm for the first time\nwithout assuming a dust opacity model. The albedo at these wavelengths is high,\n$\\sim0.5-0.8$, and broadly consistent with the Ricci et al. (2010), DIANA, and\nDSHARP dust models.

The tests only require the\nconvergence rate of parameter estimators to derive the limiting distribution.\nThe growing rate of the dimension is allowed to be of exponential order in\nrelation to the sample size. As random projection converts covariates to\none-dimensional space, our tests can detect the local alternative departing\nfrom the null at the rate of $n^{-1/2}h^{-1/4}$ where $h$ is the bandwidth, and\n$n$ is the sample size. This sensitive rate is not related to the dimension of\ncovariates, and thus the \"curse of dimensionality\" for our tests would be\nlargely alleviated. An interesting and unexpected result is that for randomly\nchosen projections, the resulting test statistics can be asymptotic\nindependent. We then proposed combination methods to enhance the power\nperformance of the tests.

Experimental results on standard benchmarks such as MSVD and MSR-VTT\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both automatic\nmetrics (CIDEr, BLEU-4, ROUGE-L) and human evaluations, achieving more fluent,\ncoherent, and relevant captions.

Inspired by large language models,\nmainstream OSOD and OSS methods generally utilize text as a prompt, achieving\nremarkable performance. Following SAM paradigm, some researchers use visual\nprompts, such as points, boxes, and masks that cover detection or segmentation\ntargets. Despite these two prompt paradigms exhibit excellent performance, they\nalso reveal inherent limitations.

To address the above issues, we propose a novel prompt\nparadigm in OSOD and OSS, that is, \\textbf{Image Prompt Paradigm}. This brand\nnew prompt paradigm enables to detect or segment specialized categories without\nmulti-round human intervention. To achieve this goal, the proposed image prompt\nparadigm uses just a few image instances as prompts, and we propose a novel\nframework named \\textbf{MI Grounding} for this new paradigm.

These attacks aim to\nmanipulate the victim into specific behaviors that align with the attacker's\nobjectives, often bypassing traditional reward-based defenses. Prior methods\nhave primarily focused on reducing cumulative rewards; however, rewards are\ntypically too generic to capture complex safety requirements effectively. As a\nresult, focusing solely on reward reduction can lead to suboptimal attack\nstrategies, particularly in safety-critical scenarios where more precise\nbehavior manipulation is needed. To address these challenges, we propose RAT, a\nmethod designed for universal, targeted behavior attacks. RAT trains an\nintention policy that is explicitly aligned with human preferences, serving as\na precise behavioral target for the adversary. Concurrently, an adversary\nmanipulates the victim's policy to follow this target behavior. To enhance the\neffectiveness of these attacks, RAT dynamically adjusts the state occupancy\nmeasure within the replay buffer, allowing for more controlled and effective\nbehavior manipulation. Our empirical results on robotic simulation tasks\ndemonstrate that RAT outperforms existing adversarial attack algorithms in\ninducing specific behaviors.

Watermarking using backdooring is the most well\nestablished method available in the literature, with specific works\ndemonstrating the difficulty in removing the watermarks, embedded as backdoors\nwithin the weights of the network. However, in our work, we have identified a\ncritical flaw in the design of the watermark verification with backdoors,\npertaining to the behaviour of the samples of the Trigger Set, which acts as\nthe secret key. In this paper, we present BlockDoor, which is a comprehensive\npackage of techniques that is used as a wrapper to block all three different\nkinds of Trigger samples, which are used in the literature as means to embed\nwatermarks within the trained neural networks as backdoors. The framework\nimplemented through BlockDoor is able to detect potential Trigger samples,\nthrough separate functions for adversarial noise based triggers,\nout-of-distribution triggers and random label based triggers. Apart from a\nsimple Denial-of-Service for a potential Trigger sample, our approach is also\nable to modify the Trigger samples for correct machine learning functionality.\nExtensive evaluation of BlockDoor establishes that it is able to significantly\nreduce the watermark validation accuracy of the Trigger set by up to $98\\%$\nwithout compromising on functionality, delivering up to a less than $1\\%$ drop\non the clean samples.

Motivated by this and the need to fit\nwith the $\\ell_1$-based index of prediction accuracy in, e.g., judicial\nsentencing prediction problems, we propose a two-step weighted $\\ell_1$-based\nadaptive identification algorithm. Under certain excitation conditions much\nweaker than the traditional persistent excitation (PE) condition, we will\nestablish the global convergence of both the parameter estimators and the\nadaptive predictors. It is worth noting that our results do not rely on the\nwidely used independent and identically distributed (iid) assumptions on the\nsystem signals, and thus do not exclude applications to feedback control\nsystems. We will demonstrate the advantages of our proposed new adaptive\nalgorithm over the existing $\\ell_2$-based ones, through both a numerical\nexample and a real-data-based sentencing prediction problem.",

However, current robots struggle to fully and\naccurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional\ngripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack\nadvanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks,\nespecially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied\nDexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in\ncluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach\nto semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses\nvoice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of\nmulti-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired\nby human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient\ngrasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis,\nmulti-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact\nmechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression\nRepresentation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation,\ndemonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring\nexpressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle\ncomplex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates,\nhighlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.",

The optimal feedback\npolicy of the exploratory unconstrained classical EU problem is shown to be\nGaussian. In the case where the portfolio weight is constrained to a given\ninterval, the corresponding constrained optimal exploratory policy follows a\ntruncated Gaussian distribution. We verify that the closed form optimal\nsolution obtained for logarithmic utility and quadratic utility for both\nunconstrained and constrained situations converge to the non-exploratory\nexpected utility counterpart when the exploration weight goes to zero. Finally,\nwe establish a policy improvement theorem and devise an implementable\nreinforcement learning algorithm by casting the optimal problem in a martingale\nframework. Our numerical examples show that exploration leads to an optimal\nwealth process that is more dispersedly distributed with heavier tail compared\nto that of the case without exploration. This effect becomes less significant\nas the exploration parameter is smaller. Moreover, the numerical implementation\nalso confirms the intuitive understanding that a broader domain of investment\nopportunities necessitates a higher exploration cost.

An effective approach\nto address continual learning is to use a large pre-trained model with\ntask-specific adapters to adapt to the new tasks. Though this approach can\nmitigate catastrophic forgetting, they fail to transfer knowledge across tasks\nas each task is learning adapters separately. To address this, we propose a\nnovel approach Linked Adapters that allows knowledge transfer through a\nweighted attention mechanism to other task-specific adapters. Linked adapters\nuse a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to model the attention weights, which\novercomes the challenge of backward knowledge transfer in continual learning in\naddition to modeling the forward knowledge transfer. During inference, our\nproposed approach effectively leverages knowledge transfer through MLP-based\nattention weights across all the lateral task adapters.

The dynamic arrival and departure of connection requests in\noptical networks result in particular central links experiencing more traffic\nand congestion than non-central links. The occurrence of congested links leads\nto service blocking despite the availability of resources within the network,\nrestricting the efficient utilization of network resources. The available\nalgorithms in the literature that aim to balance load among network links offer\na trade-off between blocking performance and algorithmic complexity, thus\nincreasing service provisioning time. This work proposes a dynamic\nrouting-based congestion-aware routing, modulation, core, and spectrum\nassignment (RMCSA) algorithm for space division multiplexing elastic optical\nnetworks (SDM-EONs). The algorithm finds alternative candidate paths based on\nreal-time link occupancy metrics to minimize blocking due to link congestion\nunder dynamic traffic scenarios. As a result, the algorithm reduces the\nformation of congestion hotspots in the network owing to link-betweenness\ncentrality. We have performed extensive simulations using two realistic network\ntopologies to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with relevant\nRMCSA algorithms available in the literature. The simulation results verify the\nsuperior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to the benchmark Yen's\nK-shortest paths and K-Disjoint shortest paths RMCSA algorithms in connection\nblocking ratio and spectrum utilization efficiency.

Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), which extracts pulse\nwaves from camera-captured face videos, has the potential to easily measure BP\nfor daily health monitoring. However, there are many uncertainties in BP\nestimation using rPPG, resulting in limited estimation performance. In this\npaper, we propose U-FaceBP, an uncertainty-aware Bayesian ensemble deep\nlearning method for face video-based BP measurement. U-FaceBP models three\ntypes of uncertainty, i.e., data, model, and ensemble uncertainties, in face\nvideo-based BP estimation with a Bayesian neural network (BNN). We also design\nU-FaceBP as an ensemble method, with which BP is estimated from rPPG signals,\nPPG signals estimated from face videos, and face images using multiple BNNs. A\nlarge-scale experiment with 786 subjects demonstrates that U-FaceBP outperforms\nstate-of-the-art BP estimation methods. We also show that the uncertainties\nestimated from U-FaceBP are reasonable and useful for prediction confidence.",

    "abstract": "Searches for impulsive, astrophysical transients are often highly\ncomputationally demanding. A notable example is the dedispersion process\nrequired for performing blind searches for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in radio\ntelescope data. We introduce a novel approach - Efficient Summation of\nArbitrary Masks (ESAM) - which efficiently computes 1-D convolution of many\narbitrary 2-D masks, and can be used to carry out dedispersion over thousands\nof dispersion trials efficiently. Our method matches the accuracy of the\ntraditional brute force technique in recovering the desired Signal-to-Noise\nratio (S/N) while reducing computational cost by around a factor of 10. We\ncompare its performance with existing dedispersion algorithms, such as the Fast\nDispersion Measure Transform (FDMT) algorithm, and demonstrate how ESAM\nprovides freedom to choose arbitrary masks and further optimise computational\ncost versus accuracy. We explore the potential applications of ESAM beyond FRB\nsearches.",

    "abstract": "Developing excavation autonomy is challenging given the environments where\nexcavators operate, the complexity of physical interaction and the degrees of\nfreedom of operation of the excavator itself. Simulation is a useful tool to\nbuild parts of the autonomy without the complexity of experimentation.\nTraditional excavator simulators are geared towards high fidelity interactions\nbetween the joints or between the terrain but do not incorporate other\nchallenges such as perception required for end to end autonomy. A complete\nsimulator should be capable of supporting real time operation while providing\nhigh fidelity simulation of the excavator(s), the environment, and their\ninteraction. In this paper we present TERA (Terrain Excavation Robot Autonomy),\na simulator geared towards autonomous excavator applications based on Unity3D\nand AGX that provides the extensibility and scalability required to study full\nautonomy. It provides the ability to configure the excavator and the\nenvironment per the user requirements. We also demonstrate realistic dynamics\nby incorporating a time-varying model that introduces variations in the\nsystem's responses. The simulator is then evaluated with different scenarios\nsuch as track deformation, velocities on different terrains, similarity of the\nsystem with the real excavator and the overall path error to show the\ncapabilities of the simulation.",

    "abstract": "The capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan remains a topic of\ndebate. Some critics argue that strategies to boost LLMs' reasoning skills are\nineffective in planning tasks, while others report strong outcomes merely from\ntraining models on a planning corpus. This study reassesses recent strategies\nby developing an end-to-end LLM planner and employing diverse metrics for a\nthorough evaluation. We find that merely fine-tuning LLMs on a corpus of\nplanning instances does not lead to robust planning skills, as indicated by\npoor performance on out-of-distribution test sets. At the same time, we find\nthat various strategies, including Chain-of-Thought, do enhance the probability\nof a plan being executable. This indicates progress towards better plan\nquality, despite not directly enhancing the final validity rate. Among the\nstrategies we evaluated, reinforcement learning with our novel `Longest\nContiguous Common Subsequence' reward emerged as the most effective,\ncontributing to both plan validity and executability. Overall, our research\naddresses key misconceptions in the LLM-planning literature; we validate\nincremental progress in plan executability, although plan validity remains a\nchallenge. Hence, future strategies should focus on both these aspects, drawing\ninsights from our findings.",

    "abstract": "Reducing negative user experiences is essential for the success of\nrecommendation platforms. Exposing users to inappropriate content could not\nonly adversely affect users' psychological well-beings, but also potentially\ndrive users away from the platform, sabotaging the platform's long-term\nsuccess. However, recommendation algorithms tend to weigh more heavily on\npositive feedback signals due to the scarcity of negative ones, which may\nresult in the neglect of valuable negative user feedback. In this paper, we\npropose an approach aimed at limiting negative user experiences. Our method\nprimarily relies on distributing in-feed surveys to the users, modeling the\nusers' feedback collected from the survey, and integrating the model\npredictions into the recommendation system. We further enhance the baseline\nsurvey model by integrating the Learning Hidden Unit Contributions module and\nthe Squeeze-and-Excitation module. In addition, we strive to resolve the\nproblem of response Bias by applying a survey-submit model; The A/B testing\nresults indicate a reduction in survey sexual rate and survey inappropriate\nrate, ranging from -1.44\\% to -3.9\\%. Additionally, we compared our methods\nagainst an online baseline that does not incorporate our approach. The results\nindicate that our approach significantly reduces the report rate and dislike\nrate by 1\\% to 2.27\\% compared to the baseline, confirming the effectiveness of\nour methods in enhancing user experience. After we launched the survey model\nbased our approach on our platform, the model is able to bring reductions of\n1.75\\%, 2.57\\%, 2.06\\% on reports, dislikes, survey inappropriate rate,\nrespectively.",

In a\nsoftware engineering context, sustainability has at least four dimensions:\necological, economic, social, and technical. No interventions for improving\nsocial sustainability in software engineering have been tested in rigorous\nlab-based experiments, and little evidence-based guidance is available. The\npurpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two\ninterventions-stakeholder maps and persona models-for improving social\nsustainability through software feature prioritization. We conducted a\nrandomized controlled factorial experiment with 79 undergraduate computer\nscience students. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups and\nasked to prioritize a backlog of prosocial, neutral, and antisocial user\nstories for a shopping mall's digital screen display and facial recognition\nsoftware. Participants received either persona models, a stakeholder map, both,\nor neither. We compared the differences in prioritization levels assigned to\nprosocial and antisocial user stories using Cumulative Link Mixed Model\nregression. Participants who received persona models gave significantly lower\npriorities to antisocial user stories but no significant difference was evident\nfor prosocial user stories. The effects of the stakeholder map were not\nsignificant. The interaction effects were not significant. Providing aspiring\nsoftware professionals with well-crafted persona models causes them to\nde-prioritize antisocial software features. The impact of persona modelling on\nsustainable software development therefore warrants further study with more\nexperience professionals. Moreover, the novel methodological strategy of\nassessing social sustainability behavior through backlog prioritization appears\nfeasible in lab-based settings.",

    "abstract": "Selecting representatives based on voters' preferences is a fundamental\nproblem in social choice theory. While cardinal utility functions offer a\ndetailed representation of preferences, ordinal rankings are often the only\navailable information due to their simplicity and practical constraints. The\nmetric distortion framework addresses this issue by modeling voters and\ncandidates as points in a metric space, with distortion quantifying the\nefficiency loss from relying solely on ordinal rankings. Existing works define\nthe cost of a voter with respect to a candidate as their distance and set the\noverall cost as either the sum (utilitarian) or maximum (egalitarian) of these\ncosts across all voters. They show that deterministic algorithms achieve a\nbest-possible distortion of 3 for any metric when considering a single\ncandidate.\n  This paper explores whether one can obtain a better approximation compared to\nan optimal candidate by relying on a committee of $k$ candidates ($k \\ge 1$),\nwhere the cost of a voter is defined as its distance to the closest candidate\nin the committee. We answer this affirmatively in the case of line metrics,\ndemonstrating that with $O(1)$ candidates, it is possible to achieve optimal\ncost. Our results extend to both utilitarian and egalitarian objectives,\nproviding new upper bounds for the problem.

The electron, initially prepared in the ground state, generally produces\ngreater entanglement when excited to the scattering state compared to remaining\nin the bound state. In the bound state, the final entanglement oscillates as a\nfunction of the qubit speed and can be tuned accordingly. In the case of\nlong-range interaction, the normalized exchange distribution leads to\nsubstantial final entanglement, independent of the qubit moving direction,\nindicating that even very weak but prolonged exchange can still generate\nsignificant entanglement. In the case of short-range interaction, different\nmoving directions lead to varying MI values.

    "abstract": "The detection of anomalous tissue regions (ATRs) within affected tissues is\ncrucial in clinical diagnosis and pathological studies. Conventional automated\nATR detection methods, primarily based on histology images alone, falter in\ncases where ATRs and normal tissues have subtle visual differences. The recent\nspatial transcriptomics (ST) technology profiles gene expressions across tissue\nregions, offering a molecular perspective for detecting ATRs. However, there is\na dearth of ATR detection methods that effectively harness complementary\ninformation from both histology images and ST. To address this gap, we propose\nMEATRD, a novel ATR detection method that integrates histology image and ST\ndata. MEATRD is trained to reconstruct image patches and gene expression\nprofiles of normal tissue spots (inliers) from their multimodal embeddings,\nfollowed by learning a one-class classification AD model based on latent\nmultimodal reconstruction errors. This strategy harmonizes the strengths of\nreconstruction-based and one-class classification approaches. At the heart of\nMEATRD is an innovative masked graph dual-attention transformer (MGDAT)\nnetwork, which not only facilitates cross-modality and cross-node information\nsharing but also addresses the model over-generalization issue commonly seen in\nreconstruction-based AD methods. Additionally, we demonstrate that\nmodality-specific, task-relevant information is collated and condensed in\nmultimodal bottleneck encoding generated in MGDAT, marking the first\ntheoretical analysis of the informational properties of multimodal bottleneck\nencoding. Extensive evaluations across eight real ST datasets reveal MEATRD's\nsuperior performance in ATR detection, surpassing various state-of-the-art AD\nmethods. Remarkably, MEATRD also proves adept at discerning ATRs that only show\nslight visual deviations from normal tissues.",

    "abstract": "Confidence calibration of classification models is a technique to estimate\nthe true posterior probability of the predicted class, which is critical for\nensuring reliable decision-making in practical applications. Existing\nconfidence calibration methods mostly use statistical techniques to estimate\nthe calibration curve from data or fit a user-defined calibration function, but\noften overlook fully mining and utilizing the prior distribution behind the\ncalibration curve. However, a well-informed prior distribution can provide\nvaluable insights beyond the empirical data under the limited data or\nlow-density regions of confidence scores. To fill this gap, this paper proposes\na new method that integrates the prior distribution behind the calibration\ncurve with empirical data to estimate a continuous calibration curve, which is\nrealized by modeling the sampling process of calibration data as a binomial\nprocess and maximizing the likelihood function of the binomial process. We\nprove that the calibration curve estimating method is Lipschitz continuous with\nrespect to data distribution and requires a sample size of $3/B$ of that\nrequired for histogram binning, where $B$ represents the number of bins. Also,\na new calibration metric ($TCE_{bpm}$), which leverages the estimated\ncalibration curve to estimate the true calibration error (TCE), is designed.\n$TCE_{bpm}$ is proven to be a consistent calibration measure. Furthermore,\nrealistic calibration datasets can be generated by the binomial process\nmodeling from a preset true calibration curve and confidence score\ndistribution, which can serve as a benchmark to measure and compare the\ndiscrepancy between existing calibration metrics and the true calibration\nerror.

Three decades of satellite altimetry observations allow a\nglobal assessment of sea surface information. However, the subsurface EKE with\nspatial filter has not been systematically studied due to the sparseness of\nsubsurface observational data. The subsurface EKE can be inferred both\ntheoretically and numerically from sea surface observations but is limited by\nthe issue of decreasing correlation with sea surface variables as depth\nincreases. In this work, inspired by the Taylor-series expansion of subsurface\nEKE, a multiple-input neural network approach is proposed to reconstruct the\nsubsurface monthly mean EKE from sea surface variables and subsurface\nclimatological variables (e.g., horizontal filtered velocity gradients). Four\nneural networks are trained on a high-resolution global ocean reanalysis\ndataset, namely, surface-input fully connected neural network model (FCNN),\nsurface-input Residual neural network model (ResNet), multiple-input fully\nconnected neural network model (MI-FCNN), and multiple-input residual neural\nnetwork model (MI-ResNet). The proposed MI-FCNN and MI-ResNet models integrate\nthe surface input variables and the vertical profiles of subsurface variables.\nThe MI-ResNet model outperforms the FCNN, ResNet, and MI-FCNN models, and\ntraditional physics-based models in both regional and global reconstruction of\nsubsurface EKE in the upper 2000 m. In addition, the MI-ResNet model performs\nwell for both regional and global observational data based on transfer\nlearning.

Since it is common for the circumbinary disc to be tilted with respect to\nthe binary orbital plane, we test whether the accretion dynamics can be a\ndiagnostic for binary-disc misalignment. We present hydrodynamical simulations\nto model the accretion flow from a circumbinary disc around an eccentric binary\nwith initial tilts ranging from $0^\\circ$ to $180^\\circ$ in increments of\n$15^\\circ$. Based on the initial tilt, the circumbinary disc will align towards\nthree different configurations: prograde coplanar, polar, or retrograde\ncoplanar. For discs with initial tilts evolving towards prograde coplanar\nalignment, the accretion rates onto the primary and secondary stars exhibit\nalternating preferential accretion. Circumbinary discs evolving towards polar\nalignment exhibit no alternating preferential accretion onto the binary unless\nthe initial tilt is close to the critical tilt that sets the boundary between\ncoplanar or polar alignment. Such cases cause strong disc warping, leading to\ndisc breaking. The inner disc becomes eccentric, leading to alternating\npreferential accretion onto the binary. As the break propagates outward, the\ndisc tilt damps towards a polar state and the disc eccentricity decreases. As\nthe disc re-circularizes, the accretion rate transitions back from alternating\npreferential accretion to non-alternating accretion. Lastly, no alternating\npreferential accretion exists for discs undergoing retrograde coplanar\nalignment. From the summary of the accretion rates from our suite of SPH\nsimulations, it is evident that the accretion rate evolution can be affected by\nthe initial tilt and subsequent evolution of the circumbinary disc.",

While there\nhave been striking improvements in image denoising with the emergence of\nadvanced deep learning architectures and real-world datasets, recent denoising\nnetworks struggle to maintain performance on images with noise that has not\nbeen seen during training. One typical approach to address the challenge would\nbe to adapt a denoising network to new noise distribution.

Through this study, we also confirmed that the\nperformance of OCR is affected by the simplified characters, variants, variant\ncharacters, common characters, and alternators of Chinese characters that are\ndifficult to see in other studies, and we propose that the results of this\nstudy can be applied to optical character recognition of modern documents in\nmultiple languages as well as other typefaces in classical documents.",

In another paper [to appear\nin J. Eur. Math.

These two results are very strong pieces of evidence for\nthe conjecture that translational tiling of $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ with a monotile is\nundecidable, for some fixed $n$. This paper gives another supportive result for\nthis conjecture by showing that translational tiling of the $4$-dimensional\nspace with a set of three connected tiles is undecidable.",

We find that in the simulations with\npartial ionization (PI), the structure of the emerging field consists of\narch-like fieldlines with very little twist since the axis of the initial\nrising field remains below the photosphere. The plasma inside the emerging\nvolume is less dense and it is moving faster compared to the fully ionized (FI)\nsimulation. In both cases, new flux ropes (FR) are formed due to reconnection\nbetween emerging fieldlines, and they eventually erupt in an ejective manner\ntowards the outer solar atmosphere. We are witnessing three major eruptions in\nboth simulations. At least for the first eruption, the formation of the\neruptive FR occurs in the low atmosphere in the FI case and at coronal heights\nin the PI case. Also, in the first PI eruption, part of the eruptive FR carries\nneutrals in the high atmosphere, for a short period of time.

STEREO was designed to\ninvestigate this conjecture, which could potentially extend the Standard Model\n(SM). The detector provides a comprehensive study of anomalies for a pure\n$^{235}\\text{U} $ antineutrino spectrum, using a Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU)\ncore. We describe an analysis of the full set of data generated by STEREO and\nan accurate prediction of reactor antineutrinos. The measured antineutrino\nenergy spectrum suggests that the anomalies originate from biases in nuclear\nexperimental data used for predictions, while rejecting the hypothesis of a\nlight sterile neutrino.

We then train random forest multiclass classifier\nmodels on a vector of invariants derived from this time-series.

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose: High-quality 4D MRI requires an impractically long scanning\ntime for dense k-space signal acquisition covering all respiratory phases.\nAccelerated sparse sampling followed by reconstruction enhancement is desired\nbut often results in degraded image quality and long reconstruction time. We\nhereby propose the chained iterative reconstruction network (CIRNet) for\nefficient sparse-sampling reconstruction while maintaining clinically\ndeployable quality. Methods: CIRNet adopts the denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic framework to condition the image reconstruction through a\nstochastic iterative denoising process. During training, a forward Markovian\ndiffusion process is designed to gradually add Gaussian noise to the densely\nsampled ground truth (GT), while CIRNet is optimized to iteratively reverse the\nMarkovian process from the forward outputs. At the inference stage, CIRNet\nperforms the reverse process solely to recover signals from noise, conditioned\nupon the undersampled input. CIRNet processed the 4D data (3D+t) as temporal\nslices (2D+t). The proposed framework is evaluated on a data cohort consisting\nof 48 patients (12332 temporal slices) who underwent free-breathing liver 4D\nMRI. 3-, 6-, 10-, 20- and 30-times acceleration were examined with a\nretrospective random undersampling scheme. Compressed sensing (CS)\nreconstruction with a spatiotemporal constraint and a recently proposed deep\nnetwork, Re-Con-GAN, are selected as baselines. Results: CIRNet consistently\nachieved superior performance compared to CS and Re-Con-GAN. The inference time\nof CIRNet, CS, and Re-Con-GAN are 11s, 120s, and 0.15s. Conclusion: A novel\nframework, CIRNet, is presented. CIRNet maintains useable image quality for\nacceleration up to 30 times, significantly reducing the burden of 4DMRI.",

Our policies are\ntrained with simulation data only and can be deployed on lowcost hardware not\nrequiring real-time joint state feedback. We train our model in a\nteacher-student model with 2 phases: In phase 1, we use reinforcement learning\nwith access to privileged information such as height maps and joint feedback.\nIn phase 2, we use supervised learning to distill the model into one with\naccess to only onboard observations, consisting of egocentric depth images and\nrobot pose captured by a tracking VIO camera. By manipulating available\nprivileged information, constructing simulation terrains, and refining reward\nfunctions during phase 1 training, we are able to train the robots with skills\nthat are robust in non-ideal physical environments.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of identification of safe regions in the environment\nof an autonomous system. The environment is divided into a finite collections\nof Voronoi cells, with each cell having a representative, the Voronoi center.\nThe extent to which each region is considered to be safe by an oracle is\ncaptured through a trust distribution. The trust placed by the oracle\nconditioned on the region is modeled through a Bernoulli distribution whose the\nparameter depends on the region. The parameters are unknown to the system.\nHowever, if the agent were to visit a given region, it will receive a binary\nvalued random response from the oracle on whether the oracle trusts the region\nor not. The objective is to design a path for the agent where, by traversing\nthrough the centers of the cells, the agent is eventually able to label each\ncell safe or unsafe. To this end, we formulate an active parameter learning\nproblem with the objective of minimizing visits or stays in potentially unsafe\nregions. The active learning problem is formulated as a finite horizon\nstochastic control problem where the cost function is derived utilizing the\nlarge deviations principle (LDP). The challenges associated with a dynamic\nprogramming approach to solve the problem are analyzed. Subsequently, the\noptimization problem is relaxed to obtain single-step optimization problems for\nwhich closed form solution is obtained. Using the solution, we propose an\nalgorithm for the active learning of the parameters. A relationship between the\ntrust distributions and the label of a cell is defined and subsequently a\nclassification algorithm is proposed to identify the safe regions. We prove\nthat the algorithm identifies the safe regions with finite number of visits to\nunsafe regions. We demonstrate the algorithm through an example.",

In principle, IIT's axioms and postulates allow one to\n\"unfold\" a cause-effect structure from a substrate in a state, a structure that\nfully defines the intrinsic meaning of an experience and its contents.

    "abstract": "Handling model mismatch is a common challenge in model-based controller\ndesign, particularly in model predictive control (MPC). While robust MPC is\neffective in managing uncertainties, its conservatism often makes it less\ndesirable in practice. Certainty-equivalence MPC (CE-MPC), which relies on a\nnominal model, offers an appealing alternative due to its design simplicity and\nlow computational requirements. Contrary to the existing analyses where MPC has\naccess to the true model, this paper investigates CE-MPC for uncertain\nnonlinear systems with input constraints and parametric uncertainty. The\nprimary contributions of the paper are two-fold. First, a novel perturbation\nanalysis of the MPC value function is provided, without relying on the common\nassumption of Lipschitz continuity of the stage cost, better tailoring the\npopular quadratic cost and having broader applicability to value function\napproximation, online model learning in MPC, and performance-driven MPC design.\nSecond, the stability and performance analysis of CE-MPC are provided, with a\nquantification of the suboptimality of CE-MPC compared to the infinite-horizon\noptimal controller with perfect model knowledge. The results provide valuable\ninsights in how the prediction horizon and model mismatch jointly affect\nstability and performance. Furthermore, the general results are specialized to\nlinear quadratic control, and a competitive ratio bound is derived, serving as\nthe first competitive-ratio bound for MPC of uncertain linear systems with\ninput constraints and multiplicative uncertainty.",
