    "abstract": "Compounds with the anti-PbFCl structure exhibit a variety of electronic\ninstabilities and intriguing physical properties. NaAlSi and NaAlGe are similar\ntopological nodal-line semimetals, but they have distinct properties. NaAlSi is\na superconductor at 6.8 K, whereas NaAlGe is an insulator with a pseudogap of\napproximately 100 K. Using the potassium-indium flux method, we succeeded in\nsynthesizing a single crystal of KAlGe, a new anti-PbFCl compound. First\nprinciples electronic structure calculations reveal that KAlGe is isoelectronic\nwith NaAlSi and NaAlGe. KAlGe undergoes a metal-to-metal transition at 89 K and\nexhibits no superconductivity above 1.8 K. The low temperature phase has\nsignificantly lower carrier density and extremely high mobility, similar to\nDirac electron systems. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction experiments show a\nstructural change that breaks the fourfold symmetry during the phase\ntransition. Electron-phonon interactions may be responsible for\nsuperconductivity in NaAlSi, whereas excitonic electron-hole interactions are\nthought to play an important role in KAlGe and possibly NaAlGe. Our findings\ndemonstrate that fascinating physics lies within the compound family.",

Here, we show that strong\ninteractions in fractionally-filled topological bands realize a class of Mott\ninsulating states on emergent topological Kondo lattices. These can be\nnaturally described by a partial Wannier basis of N-1 exponentially-localized\norbitals for an N-band manifold with net non-zero Chern number. Choosing a\ngauge which breaks translation symmetry, we construct a supercell basis which\nsegregates an isolated topological band into well-localized supercell Wannier\norbitals that can host the local moments of a Mott insulating state, as well as\nan itinerant power-law-localized orbital that retains the topological\nobstruction. Together, they constitute a spontaneous Kondo lattice. We study\nfractionally-filled interacting quantum spin Hall bands in the\nBernevig-Hughes-Zhang model as well as twisted bilayers of MoTe2 at -1/3\nfilling. We demonstrate that strong short-ranged Coulomb interactions can\nstabilize a new class of topological Mott insulating states with broken\ntranslation symmetry and antiferromagnetic order, which compete with fractional\nChern insulating states.

    "abstract": "Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years\ndue to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of\nmolecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian\nmechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they\nlead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In the first paper of this series [J.\nChem. Phys. 158, 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling\nrelationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in the following companion\npaper [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG\nsystem into a dynamically-consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive\nan expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems\ndo not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the\ndeveloped theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the\nnon-hard sphere system based on the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen perturbation\ntheory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy\nterm as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for\nthe extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This\napproach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in\nliquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models\nusing the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets.

In this work, we extend the Attention-boosted\nWaveform Reconstruction network to address glitch mitigation, demonstrating its\nrobustness in reconstructing waveforms in the presence of real glitches from\nthe third observing run of LIGO. Without requiring explicit training on\nglitches, AWaRe accurately isolates gravitational wave signals from data\ncontaminated by glitches spanning a wide range of amplitudes and morphologies.\nWe evaluate this capability by investigating the events GW191109 and GW200129,\nwhich exhibit strong evidence of anti-aligned spins and spin precession\nrespectively, but may be adversely affected by data quality issues. We find\nthat, regardless of the potential presence of glitches in the data, AWaRe\nreconstructs both waveforms with high accuracy. Additionally, we perform a\nsystematic study of the performance of AWaRe on a simulated catalog of injected\nwaveforms in real LIGO glitches and obtain reliable reconstructions of the\nwaveforms. By subtracting the AWaRe reconstructions from the data, we show that\nthe resulting residuals closely align with the background noise that the\nwaveforms were injected in. The robustness of AWaRe in mitigating glitches,\ndespite being trained exclusively on GW signals and not explicitly on glitches,\nhighlights its potential as a powerful tool for improving the reliability of\nsearches and characterizing noise artifacts.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a data-driven analysis of COVID-19 discourse on YouTube,\nexamining the sentiment, toxicity, and thematic patterns of video content\npublished between January 2023 and October 2024. The analysis involved applying\nadvanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques: sentiment analysis with\nVADER, toxicity detection with Detoxify, and topic modeling using Latent\nDirichlet Allocation (LDA). The sentiment analysis revealed that 49.32% of\nvideo descriptions were positive, 36.63% were neutral, and 14.05% were\nnegative, indicating a generally informative and supportive tone in\npandemic-related content. Toxicity analysis identified only 0.91% of content as\ntoxic, suggesting minimal exposure to toxic content. Topic modeling revealed\ntwo main themes, with 66.74% of the videos covering general health information\nand pandemic-related impacts and 33.26% focused on news and real-time updates,\nhighlighting the dual informational role of YouTube. A recommendation system\nwas also developed using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, refined by\nsentiment, toxicity, and topic filters to ensure relevant and context-aligned\nvideo recommendations. This system achieved 69% aggregate coverage, with\nmonthly coverage rates consistently above 85%, demonstrating robust performance\nand adaptability over time. Evaluation across recommendation sizes showed\ncoverage reaching 69% for five video recommendations and 79% for ten video\nrecommendations per video. In summary, this work presents a framework for\nunderstanding COVID-19 discourse on YouTube and a recommendation system that\nsupports user engagement while promoting responsible and relevant content\nrelated to COVID-19.",

Communication technologies rely\non frequency mixing, enabling signals to be converted from one frequency to\nanother and transmitted from a sender to a receiver. Technically, this process\nis implemented using nonlinear components such as diodes or transistors.\nHowever, the highest operation frequency of this approach is limited to sub-THz\nbands. Here, we demonstrate the upconversion of a weak sub-THz signal from a\nphotoconductive antenna to multiple THz bands. The key element is a\nhigh-mobility HgTe-based heterostructure with electronic band inversion,\nleading to one of the strongest third-order nonlinearities among all materials\nin the THz range. Due to the Dirac character of electron dispersion, the highly\nintense sub-THz radiation is efficiently mixed with the antenna signal,\nresulting in a THz response at linear combinations of their frequencies. The\nfield conversion efficiency above 2$\\%$ is provided by a bare tensile-strained\nHgTe layer with a thickness below 100 nm at room temperature under ambient\nconditions.

In this paper, we propose Wavelet\nPatch Mixer (WPMixer), a novel MLP-based model, for long-term time series\nforecasting, which leverages the benefits of patching, multi-resolution wavelet\ndecomposition, and mixing. Our model is based on three key components: (i)\nmulti-resolution wavelet decomposition, (ii) patching and embedding, and (iii)\nMLP mixing. Multi-resolution wavelet decomposition efficiently extracts\ninformation in both the frequency and time domains. Patching allows the model\nto capture an extended history with a look-back window and enhances capturing\nlocal information while MLP mixing incorporates global information.

This KM can only occur if\nparticles having both SM and dark quantum numbers, here termed portal matter\n(PM), also exist. The presence of such types of states and the strong\nsuggestion of a need to embed $U(1)_D$ into a non-abelian gauge structure not\ntoo far above the TeV scale based on the RGE running of the $U(1)_D$ gauge\ncoupling is potentially indicative of an enlarged group linking together the\nvisible and dark sectors.

A\ncritical challenge in this approach is the effective tokenization of items,\nensuring that they are represented in a form compatible with LLMs. Current item\ntokenization methods include using text descriptions, numerical strings, or\nsequences of discrete tokens. While text-based representations integrate\nseamlessly with LLM tokenization, they are often too lengthy, leading to\ninefficiencies and complicating accurate generation. Numerical strings, while\nconcise, lack semantic depth and fail to capture meaningful item relationships.\nTokenizing items as sequences of newly defined tokens has gained traction, but\nit often requires external models or algorithms for token assignment. These\nexternal processes may not align with the LLM's internal pretrained\ntokenization schema, leading to inconsistencies and reduced model performance.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a self-improving item tokenization\nmethod that allows the LLM to refine its own item tokenizations during training\nprocess. Our approach starts with item tokenizations generated by any external\nmodel and periodically adjusts these tokenizations based on the LLM's learned\npatterns. Such alignment process ensures consistency between the tokenization\nand the LLM's internal understanding of the items, leading to more accurate\nrecommendations. Furthermore, our method is simple to implement and can be\nintegrated as a plug-and-play enhancement into existing generative\nrecommendation systems.

In twistorial theories, generalized towers of soft modes\n(including states of both helicities) form a 2d chiral algebra even at the\nquantum level. The 2d OPE limit of this chiral algebra coincides with the\nholomorphic collinear limit in 4d. This is true, in particular, for self-dual\nYang-Mills (SDYM) theory coupled to special choices of matter, the latter being\nrequired to make the theory twistorial. Costello and the second author recently\nproposed that form factors of such twistorial 4d theories could be computed as\n2d chiral algebra correlators. In turn, there exist form factors of self-dual\ntheories, with insertions of appropriate local operators, that compute a\nsubclass of observables in full (i.e. non-self-dual) QCD, coupled to\nappropriate matter. For example, the n-point two-loop all + QCD amplitude has\nrecently been computed using the 1-loop chiral algebra OPEs determined thus\nfar, but higher orders of the quantum-deformed chiral algebra must be\ndetermined to continue the ``chiral algebra bootstrap'' program for\nhigher-loop-level form factors of these twistorial theories. In this paper,\nusing only elementary constraints from symmetries and associativity, we obtain\nclosed-form expressions for the extended chiral algebra OPEs to arbitrary\nloop-order. This can be viewed as providing an all-loop result for a subset of\ncollinear splitting functions in non-supersymmetric, massless QCD coupled to\nspecial choices of matter.",

It has the capability of providing a\nricher view of time series data than that offered by the ordinary spectrum\nespecially for nonlinear dynamics such as stochastic volatility. A novel\nmethod, called spline autoregression (SAR), is proposed in this paper for\nestimating the quantile spectrum as a bivaraite function of frequency and\nquantile level, under the assumption that the quantile spectrum varies smoothly\nwith the quantile level. The SAR method is facilitated by the quantile discrete\nFourier transform (QDFT) based on trigonometric quantile regression. It is\nenabled by the resulting time-domain quantile series (QSER) which represents\nproperly scaled oscillatory characteristics of the original time series around\na quantile. A functional autoregressive (AR) model is fitted to the QSER on a\ngrid of quantile levels by penalized least-squares with the AR coefficients\nrepresented as smoothing splines of the quantile level. While the ordinary AR\nmodel is widely used for conventional spectral estimation, the proposed SAR\nmethod provides an effective way of estimating the quantile spectrum as a\nbivariate function in comparison with the alternatives.

The prequantum operators for the components of\nthe moment map of the $T^p$-action act diagonally with discrete spectrum\ncorresponding to the integral points of the moment polytope.

We ask an ambitious question: can a pre-trained AR model be adapted to\ngenerate outputs in just one or two steps? If successful, this would\nsignificantly advance the development and deployment of AR models. We notice\nthat existing works that try to speed up AR generation by generating multiple\ntokens at once fundamentally cannot capture the output distribution due to the\nconditional dependencies between tokens, limiting their effectiveness for\nfew-step generation. To address this, we propose Distilled Decoding (DD), which\nuses flow matching to create a deterministic mapping from Gaussian distribution\nto the output distribution of the pre-trained AR model. We then train a network\nto distill this mapping, enabling few-step generation. DD doesn't need the\ntraining data of the original AR model, making it more practical. We evaluate\nDD on state-of-the-art image AR models and present promising results on\nImageNet-256. For VAR, which requires 10-step generation, DD enables one-step\ngeneration (6.3$\\times$ speed-up), with an acceptable increase in FID from 4.19\nto 9.96. For LlamaGen, DD reduces generation from 256 steps to 1, achieving an\n217.8$\\times$ speed-up with a comparable FID increase from 4.11 to 11.35. In\nboth cases, baseline methods completely fail with FID>100. DD also excels on\ntext-to-image generation, reducing the generation from 256 steps to 2 for\nLlamaGen with minimal FID increase from 25.70 to 28.95. As the first work to\ndemonstrate the possibility of one-step generation for image AR models, DD\nchallenges the prevailing notion that AR models are inherently slow, and opens\nup new opportunities for efficient AR generation.

Both homogeneous SE properties and polycrystalline\nSEs with either low or high conductivity grain boundaries (GBs) are considered\nfor all three examples. Heterogeneous GB conductivity has no significant impact\non the behavior with a perfect electrode/electrolyte interface. However, it\ndoes result in local changes to void growth due to interactions between the\nvoid edge and the GBs. The void growth rate is a linear function of the flux of\nNa atoms at the void edge, which in turn depends on the applied current\ndensity.

Both models successfully predict neural activity, demonstrating\nsignificant correlations between estimated and observed MEG signals.

    "abstract": "Complex Langevin simulations are an attempt to solve the sign (or\ncomplex-action) problem encountered in various physical systems of interest.\nThe method is based on a complexification of the underlying degrees of freedom\nand an evolution in an auxiliary time dimension. The complexification, however,\ndoes not come without drawbacks, the most severe of which is the infamous\n'wrong convergence' problem, stating that complex Langevin simulations\nsometimes fail to produce correct answers despite their apparent convergence.\nIt has long been realized that wrong convergence may - in principle - be fixed\nby the introduction of a suitable kernel into the complex Langevin equation,\nsuch that the conventional correctness criteria are met. However, as we discuss\nin this work, complex Langevin results may - especially in the presence of a\nkernel - still be affected by unwanted so-called integration cycles of the\ntheory spoiling them. Indeed, we confirm numerically that in the absence of\nboundary terms the complex Langevin results are given by a linear combination\nof such integration cycles, as put forward by Salcedo & Seiler. In particular,\nwe shed light on the way different choices of kernel affect which integration\ncycles are being sampled in a simulation and how this knowledge can be used to\nensure correct convergence in simple toy models.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in MCMC use normalizing flows to precondition target\ndistributions and enable jumps to distant regions. However, there is currently\nno systematic comparison of different normalizing flow architectures for MCMC.\nAs such, many works choose simple flow architectures that are readily available\nand do not consider other models. Guidelines for choosing an appropriate\narchitecture would reduce analysis time for practitioners and motivate\nresearchers to take the recommended models as foundations to be improved. We\nprovide the first such guideline by extensively evaluating many normalizing\nflow architectures on various flow-based MCMC methods and target distributions.\nWhen the target density gradient is available, we show that flow-based MCMC\noutperforms classic MCMC for suitable NF architecture choices with minor\nhyperparameter tuning. When the gradient is unavailable, flow-based MCMC wins\nwith off-the-shelf architectures. We find contractive residual flows to be the\nbest general-purpose models with relatively low sensitivity to hyperparameter\nchoice. We also provide various insights into normalizing flow behavior within\nMCMC when varying their hyperparameters, properties of target distributions,\nand the overall computational budget.",

    "abstract": "Spoofing-robust automatic speaker verification (SASV) systems are a crucial\ntechnology for the protection against spoofed speech. In this study, we focus\non logical access attacks and introduce a novel approach to SASV tasks. A novel\nrepresentation of genuine and spoofed speech is employed, based on the\nprobability mass function (PMF) of waveform amplitudes in the time domain. This\nmethodology generates novel time embeddings derived from the PMF of selected\ngroups within the training set. This paper highlights the role of gender\nsegregation and its positive impact on performance. We propose a countermeasure\n(CM) system that employs time-domain embeddings derived from the PMF of spoofed\nand genuine speech, as well as gender recognition based on male and female\ntime-based embeddings. The method exhibits notable gender recognition\ncapabilities, with mismatch rates of 0.94% and 1.79% for males and females,\nrespectively. The male and female CM systems achieve an equal error rate (EER)\nof 8.67% and 10.12%, respectively. By integrating this approach with\ntraditional speaker verification systems, we demonstrate improved\ngeneralization ability and tandem detection cost function evaluation using the\nASVspoof2019 challenge database.

We present an efficient implementation with $O(N^4)$\nscaling with respect to the system size $N$, within an all-electron framework\nbased on numeric atom-centered orbitals. We demonstrate that decoupling the\ncore and valence spaces is crucial when using localized basis functions.\nAdditionally, we meticulously validate the basis set convergence of the\nsatellite spectrum for 65 spectral functions and identify the importance of\ndiffuse augmenting functions. To assess the accuracy, we apply our $GW+C$\nscheme to $\\pi$-conjugated molecules containing up to 40 atoms, predicting\ndominant satellite features within 0.5~eV of experimental values.

    "abstract": "We introduce the notion of empirical coordination for quantum correlations.\nQuantum mechanics enables the calculation of probabilities for experimental\noutcomes, emphasizing statistical averages rather than detailed descriptions of\nindividual events. This makes empirical coordination a natural and\noperationally meaningful framework for quantum systems - particularly in the\ncontext of nonlocal games, which rely on repeated measurements to assess\nperformance. We begin by analyzing networks with classical links, focusing on\nthe cascade network. For this setting, we establish the optimal coordination\nrates, which indicate the minimal resources required to simulate a quantum\nstate on average. Providing the users with shared randomness, before\ncommunication begins, does not affect the optimal rates for empirical\ncoordination.\n  Our analysis starts with a basic two-node scenario and extends to cascade\nnetworks, including the special case of a network with an isolated node. The\nresults can be further generalized to other networks as our analysis includes a\ngeneric achievability scheme. The optimal rate formula involves optimization\nover a collection of state extensions. This is a unique feature of the quantum\nsetting, as the classical parallel does not include optimization. As\ndemonstrated through examples, the performance depends heavily on the choice of\ndecomposition.\n  We then extend the framework to networks with quantum links, focusing on a\nbroadcast setting where the receivers have side information. Finally, we\ndiscuss how our results provide new insights into the implementation and\nsimulation of quantum nonlocal games in the empirical regime.",

However, such tools were largely developed for\nsupervised learning rather than nonstationary RL, leading practitioners to\nadopt target networks, clipped policy updates, and other RL-specific\nimplementation tricks to combat this mismatch, rather than directly adapting\nthis toolchain for use in RL. In this paper, we take a different approach and\ninstead address the effect of nonstationarity by adapting the widely used Adam\noptimiser. We first analyse the impact of nonstationary gradient magnitude --\nsuch as that caused by a change in target network -- on Adam's update size,\ndemonstrating that such a change can lead to large updates and hence\nsub-optimal performance. To address this, we introduce Adam-Rel. Rather than\nusing the global timestep in the Adam update, Adam-Rel uses the local timestep\nwithin an epoch, essentially resetting Adam's timestep to 0 after target\nchanges. We demonstrate that this avoids large updates and reduces to learning\nrate annealing in the absence of such increases in gradient magnitude.\nEvaluating Adam-Rel in both on-policy and off-policy RL, we demonstrate\nimproved performance in both Atari and Craftax. We then show that increases in\ngradient norm occur in RL in practice, and examine the differences between our\ntheoretical model and the observed data.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, quantum computing has started to demonstrate superior\nefficiency to classical computing. In quantum computing, quantum circuits that\nimplement specific quantum algorithms are usually not directly executable on\nquantum computer hardware. Quantum circuit compilers decompose high-level\nquantum gates into the hardware's native gates and optimize the circuits for\naccuracy and performance. However, untrusted quantum compilers risk stealing\noriginal quantum designs (quantum circuits), leading to the theft of sensitive\nintellectual property (IP). In classical computing, logic locking is a family\nof techniques to secure integrated circuit (ICs) designs against reverse\nengineering and IP piracy. This technique involves inserting a keyed value into\nthe circuit, ensuring the correct output is achieved only with the correct key.\nTo address similar issues in quantum circuit protection, we propose an enhanced\nlocking technique for quantum circuits (E-LoQ) where multiple key bits can be\ncondensed into one key qubit. Compared to previous work that used one qubit for\neach key bit, our approach achieves higher security levels. We have\ndemonstrated the practicality of our method through experiments on a set of\nbenchmark quantum circuits. The effectiveness of E-LoQ was measured by\nassessing the divergence distance from the original circuit. Our results\ndemonstrate that E-LoQ effectively conceals the function of the original\nquantum circuit, with an average fidelity degradation of less than 1%.",

To\nthis end, we develop a synthetic data pipeline using sticker-like elements to\nsynthesize accurate, high-quality datasets efficiently, which enables editing\ndata scaling up for unified model training. For training, DreamOmni jointly\ntrains T2I generation and downstream tasks. T2I training enhances the model's\nunderstanding of specific concepts and improves generation quality, while\nediting training helps the model grasp the nuances of the editing task.

In glycerol-water mixtures (positive\nMarangoni number, where the more volatile fluid has higher surface tension),\nthese flows stabilise into steady patterns. Conversely, in water-ethanol\nmixtures (negative Marangoni number, where the less volatile fluid has higher\nsurface tension), Marangoni instabilities emerge, producing seemingly chaotic\nflows. This behaviour arises from the opposing signs of the Marangoni number.\nPerturbations locally reducing surface tension at the interface drive Marangoni\nflows away from the perturbed region. Incompressibility enforces a return flow,\ndrawing fluid from the bulk towards the interface. In mixtures with a negative\nMarangoni number, preferential evaporation of the lower-surface-tension\ncomponent leads to a higher concentration of the higher-surface-tension\ncomponent at the interface as compared to the bulk. The return flow therefore\ncreates a positive feedback loop, further reducing surface tension and\nenhancing the instability. We investigate bistable quasi-stationary solutions\nin evaporating binary droplets with negative Marangoni numbers and we examine\nsymmetry breaking across a range of Marangoni number and contact angles.\nRemarkably, droplets with low contact angle show instabilities at lower\ncritical Marangoni numbers than droplets with larger contact angles. Our\nnumerical simulations reveal that interactions between droplet height profiles\nand non-uniform evaporation rates trigger azimuthal Marangoni instabilities in\nflat droplets. This geometrically confined instability can even destabilise\nmixtures with positive Marangoni numbers, particularly for concave liquid-gas\ninterfaces. Finally, through Lyapunov exponent analysis, we confirm the chaotic\nnature of flows in droplets with a negative Marangoni number.",

Studying both Lyapunov exponents, as well as their\nfinite time counterparts, provides two new insights.

    "abstract": "This paper studies a sub-connected six-dimensional movable antenna\n(6DMA)-aided multi-user communication system. In this system, each sub-array is\nconnected to a dedicated radio frequency chain and collectively moves and\nrotates as a unit within specific local regions. The movement and rotation\ncapabilities of 6DMAs enhance design flexibility, facilitating the capture of\nspatial variations for improved communication performance. To fully\ncharacterize the effect of antenna position and orientation on wireless\nchannels between the base station (BS) and users, we develop a\nfield-response-based 6DMA channel model to account for the antenna radiation\npattern and polarization. We then maximize the sum rate of multiple users, by\njointly optimizing the digital and unit-modulus analog beamformers given the\ntransmit power budget as well as the positions and orientations of sub-arrays\nwithin given movable and rotatable ranges at the BS. Due to the highly coupled\nvariables, the formulated optimization problem is non-convex and thus\nchallenging to solve. We develop a fractional programming-aided alternating\noptimization framework that integrates the Lagrange multiplier method, manifold\noptimization, and gradient descent to solve the problem. Numerical results\ndemonstrate that the proposed 6DMA-aided sub-connected structure achieves a\nsubstantial sum-rate improvement over various benchmark schemes with less\nflexibility in antenna movement and can even outperform fully-digital\nbeamforming systems that employ antenna position or orientation adjustments\nonly. The results also highlight the necessity of considering antenna\npolarization for optimally adjusting antenna orientation.",

If the control is restricted between zero and a\nmaximum value, the initial and final bang pulses attain the maximum bound but\nhave different durations, while if it is restricted between symmetric negative\nand positive boundaries, the bang pulses have the same duration but opposite\nboundary values.

To this end, we propose Clustered Federated\nSemi-Supervised Learning (CFSL), a novel framework tailored for realistic\nscenarios in HWNs.

CFSL introduces two novel\nprediction time schemes, split-based and stopping-based, for accurate labeling\ntiming, and two device selection strategies, greedy and round-robin.

    "abstract": "In the era of exoplanet studies with JWST, the transiting, hot gas giant\nWASP-52 b provides an excellent target for atmospheric characterization through\ntransit spectroscopy. WASP-52 b orbits an active K-type dwarf recognized for\nits surface heterogeneities, such as star-spots and faculae, which offers\nchallenges to atmospheric characterization via transmission spectroscopy.\nPrevious transit observations have detected active regions on WASP-52 through\ncrossing events in transit light-curves and via the spectral imprint of\nunocculted magnetic regions on transmission spectra. Here, we present the first\nJWST observations of WASP-52 b. Our JWST NIRISS/SOSS transit observation,\nobtained through the GTO 1201 Program, detects two clear spot-crossing events\nthat deform the 0.6-2.8 $\\mu$m transit light-curves of WASP-52 b. We find that\nthese two occulted spots combined cover about 2.4 % of the stellar surface and\nhave temperatures about 400-500 K colder than the stellar photosphere. Our\nNIRISS/SOSS transmission spectrum is best-fit by an atmosphere with H$_2$O\n(10.8 $\\sigma$), He (7.3 $\\sigma$, with evidence of an escaping tail at $\\sim$\n2.9 $\\sigma$), hints of K (2.5 $\\sigma$), and unocculted star-spots and faculae\n(3.6 $\\sigma$). The retrieved H$_2$O abundance ($\\log$ H$_2$O $\\approx -4 \\pm\n1$) is consistent with a subsolar or solar atmospheric metallicity for two\nindependent data reductions. Our results underscore the importance of\nsimultaneously modelling planetary atmospheres and unocculted stellar\nheterogeneities when interpreting transmission spectra of planets orbiting\nactive stars and demonstrate the necessity of considering different stellar\ncontamination models that account for both cold and hot active regions.",

    "abstract": "Circular-shift linear network coding (LNC) is a class of vector LNC with\nlocal encoding kernels selected from cyclic permutation matrices, so that it\nhas low coding complexities. However, it is insufficient to exactly achieve the\ncapacity of a multicast network, so the data units transmitted along the\nnetwork need to contain redundant symbols, which affects the transmission\nefficiency. In this paper, as a variation of circular-shift LNC, we introduce a\nnew class of vector LNC over arbitrary GF($p$), called circular-shift-based\nvector LNC, which is shown to be able to exactly achieve the capacity of a\nmulticast network. The set of local encoding kernels in circular-shift-based\nvector LNC is nontrivially designed such that it is closed under multiplication\nby elements in itself. It turns out that the coding complexity of\ncircular-shift-based vector LNC is comparable to and, in some cases, lower than\nthat of circular-shift LNC.\n  The new results in circular-shift-based vector LNC further facilitates us to\ncharacterize and design Vandermonde circulant maximum distance separable (MDS)\narray codes, which are built upon the structure of Vandermonde matrices and\ncircular-shift operations. We prove that for $r \\geq 2$, the largest possible\n$k$ for an $L$-dimensional $(k+r, k)$ Vandermonde circulant $p$-ary MDS array\ncode is $p^{m_L}-1$, where $L$ is an integer co-prime with $p$, and $m_L$\nrepresents the multiplicative order of $p$ modulo $L$. For $r = 2, 3$, we\nintroduce two new types of $(k+r, k)$ $p$-ary array codes that achieves the\nlargest $k = p^{m_L}-1$. For the special case that $p = 2$, we propose\nscheduling encoding algorithms for the 2 new codes, so that the encoding\ncomplexity not only asymptotically approaches the optimal $2$ XORs per original\ndata bit, but also slightly outperforms the encoding complexity of other known\nVandermonde circulant MDS array codes with $k = p^{m_L}-1$.",

To this end, we\npropose a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-based NF-ISAC transmit scheme\nutilizing hybrid analog-digital antennas. RSMA enhances interference\nmanagement, while a variable number of dedicated sensing beams adds beamforming\nflexibility. The objective is to maximize the minimum communication rate while\nensuring multi-target sensing performance by jointly optimizing receive\nfilters, analog and digital beamformers, common rate allocation, and the\nsensing beam count. To address uncertainty in sensing beam allocation, a\nrank-zero solution reconstruction method demonstrates that dedicated sensing\nbeams are unnecessary for NF multi-target detection.

    "abstract": "Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) is critical for\nenhancing their reliability and trustworthiness. Most research focuses on\nhallucinations as deviations from information seen during training. However,\nthe opaque nature of an LLM's parametric knowledge complicates the\nunderstanding of why generated texts appear ungrounded: The LLM might not have\npicked up the necessary knowledge from large and often inaccessible datasets,\nor the information might have been changed or contradicted during further\ntraining. Our focus is on hallucinations involving information not used in\ntraining, which we determine by using recency to ensure the information emerged\nafter a cut-off date. This study investigates these hallucinations by detecting\nthem at sentence level using different internal states of various LLMs. We\npresent HalluRAG, a dataset designed to train classifiers on these\nhallucinations. Depending on the model and quantization, MLPs trained on\nHalluRAG detect hallucinations with test accuracies ranging up to 75 %, with\nMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 achieving the highest test accuracies. Our results\nshow that IAVs detect hallucinations as effectively as CEVs and reveal that\nanswerable and unanswerable prompts are encoded differently as separate\nclassifiers for these categories improved accuracy. However, HalluRAG showed\nsome limited generalizability, advocating for more diversity in datasets on\nhallucinations.",

Renewable energy integration and\nregulated pricing policies require new and effective scheduling strategies, as\nhighlighted by the emerging field of energy-efficient scheduling. In this\npaper, we aim to contribute to this field by addressing a scheduling problem\nwhere a set of jobs must be allocated to a set of machines over a discrete\nfinite horizon and variable energy consumptions are required for job execution.\nEnergy can be obtained by a renewable source or through transactions on the\nmarket. The goal is to minimize the total energy costs from the grid while\nscheduling all the jobs within the time horizon and adhering to an energy limit\nper time period. We introduce a novel time-indexed Mixed Integer Linear\nProgramming (MILP) formulation capable of handling variable energy consumption\nfunctions, surpassing traditional models that assume constant energy usage of\njobs. We then develop a matheuristic algorithm based on an Iterated Local\nSearch (ILS) framework that exploits the MILP formulation for large\nneighborhood searches. We tested more than 200 instances with up to 200 jobs,\n35 machines, and 120 time slots. The results show a good performance of both\nour methods and highlight the advantage of using the ILS when jobs are\ncharacterized by variable consumption functions.",

The long-term variability in its nine-year\nphotometric $ugriz$-band light curves, obtained from the SDSS Stripe82 and the\nPHOTOOBJALL databases, can be described by the conventional TDE model.

The BH mass is about\n7.5 times smaller than the virial BH mass derived from the broad Mg~{\\sc ii}\nemission line, which can be explained by non-virial dynamic properties of broad\nemission lines from TDEs debris.

    "abstract": "The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) with $T_c\\approx 80$\nK in the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has aroused great interests.\nCurrently, due to technical difficulties, most experiments on\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ can only be performed at ambient pressure (AP).\nParticularly, various experiments have revealed the presence of spin-density\nwave (SDW) in the unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern with wave\nvector near $(\\pi/2,\\pi/2)$ in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. In this work, we\nemploy first-principle calculations followed by the random phase approximation\n(RPA)-based study to clarify the origin of this special SDW pattern and the\npotential SC in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. Starting from our\ndensity-functional-theory band structure, we construct an eight-band bilayer\ntight-binding model using the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which\nis equipped with the standard multi-orbital Hubbard interaction. Our RPA\ncalculation reveals an SDW order driven by Fermi-surface nesting with wave\nvector ${Q}\\approx(0,\\pm0.84\\pi)$ in the folded Brillouin zone (BZ). From the\nview of the unfolded BZ, the wave vector turns to\n${Q}_0\\approx\\pm(0.58\\pi,0.58\\pi)$, which is near the one detected by various\nexperiments. Further more, this SDW exhibits an interlayer antiferromagnetic\norder with a unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern, consistent with\nrecent soft X-ray scattering experiment. This result suggests that the origin\nof the SDW order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP can be well understood in the\nitinerant picture as driven by Fermi surfaces nesting. In the aspect of SC, our\nRPA study yields an approximate $s^\\pm$-wave spin-singlet pairing with $T_c$\nmuch lower than that under high pressure. Further more, the $T_c$ can be\nstrongly enhanced through hole doping, leading to possible high-temperature SC\nat AP.",

While hypernetworks work\nwell, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized\nweights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training\nproblem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an\nentire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a\nmethod to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground\ntruth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire\ntrajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In\nother words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the\nconvergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the\nentire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is\nthat the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then\nmatch the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient\nto train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method\nthrough the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction\nfrom images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any\nper-sample ground truth.",

    "abstract": "While face recognition (FR) models have brought remarkable convenience in\nface verification and identification, they also pose substantial privacy risks\nto the public. Existing facial privacy protection schemes usually adopt\nadversarial examples to disrupt face verification of FR models. However, these\nschemes often suffer from weak transferability against black-box FR models and\npermanently damage the identifiable information that cannot fulfill the\nrequirements of authorized operations such as forensics and authentication. To\naddress these limitations, we propose ErasableMask, a robust and erasable\nprivacy protection scheme against black-box FR models. Specifically, via\nrethinking the inherent relationship between surrogate FR models, ErasableMask\nintroduces a novel meta-auxiliary attack, which boosts black-box\ntransferability by learning more general features in a stable and balancing\noptimization strategy. It also offers a perturbation erasion mechanism that\nsupports the erasion of semantic perturbations in protected face without\ndegrading image quality. To further improve performance, ErasableMask employs a\ncurriculum learning strategy to mitigate optimization conflicts between\nadversarial attack and perturbation erasion. Extensive experiments on the\nCelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that ErasableMask achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance in transferability, achieving over 72% confidence\non average in commercial FR systems. Moreover, ErasableMask also exhibits\noutstanding perturbation erasion performance, achieving over 90% erasion\nsuccess rate.",

Each sub-pulse can adopt a different carrier\nfrequency, leading to frequency hops between sub-pulses. This design is termed\nfrequency index modulation (FIM), enabling the embedding of communication\ninformation into different carrier frequencies for transmission. To further\nenhance the data transmission rate at the communication end, this paper\nincorporates quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) into waveform design. %For\nthe SAR portion, this approach reduces the ADC sampling requirements while\nmaintaining range resolution. The paper derives the ambiguity function of the\nproposed waveform and analyzes its Doppler and range resolution, establishing\nupper and lower bounds for the range resolution. In processing SAR signals, the\nreceiver first removes QAM symbols, and to address phase discontinuities\nbetween sub-pulses, a phase compensation algorithm is proposed to achieve\ncoherent processing. For the communication receiver, the user first performs\nde-chirp processing and then demodulates QAM symbols and FIM index symbols\nusing a two-step maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm.

These agents collaborate seamlessly, integrating language models with\ngraph language models to uncover intricate relational information and data\nsemantic dependencies. Through extensive experiments on various graph-related\npredictive and text generative tasks on diverse datasets, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our GraphAgent across various settings.

First, we introduce three comprehensive datasets comprising 735\nfailure cases collected from three microservice systems, covering various fault\ntypes observed in real-world failures. Second, we present a comprehensive\nevaluation framework that includes fifteen reproducible baselines covering a\nwide range of RCA approaches, with the ability to evaluate both coarse-grained\nand fine-grained RCA. We hope that this ready-to-use benchmark will enable\nresearchers and practitioners to conduct extensive analysis and pave the way\nfor robust new solutions for RCA of microservice systems.",

Results\nreveal non-linear behaviors and potential tipping points in system resilience\nunder different climate scenarios and farm sizes. The RCP 8.5 scenario led to\nearlier and more frequent production failures, increased reliance on imports\nfor smaller farms, and complex patterns of waste accumulation and stock levels.\nThe methodology provides valuable insights into system vulnerabilities and\nadaptive capacities, offering decision support for enhancing the resilience and\nsustainability of coupled natural-industrial ecosystems in the face of climate\nchange.

A fully\nanonymous secret-sharing scheme has two key properties: (1) the identities of\nthe participants are not revealed before the secret is reconstructed, and (2)\nthe shares of any unauthorized set of participants are uniform and independent.\nIn particular, the shares of any unauthorized subset reveal no information\nabout the identity of the participants who hold them.\n  In this work, we first make the following observation: Reed-Solomon codes\nthat are robust against an adversary that permutes the codeword and then\ndeletes symbols from the permuted codeword can be used to construct ramp\nthreshold secret-sharing schemes that are fully anonymous. Then, we show that\nover large enough fields of size, there are $[n,k]$ Reed-Solomon codes that are\nrobust against an adversary that arbitrary permutes the codeword and then\nperforms $n-2k+1$ insertions and deletions to the permuted codeword. This\nimplies the existence of a $(k-1, 2k-1, n)$ ramp secret sharing scheme that is\nfully anonymous. That is, any $k-1$ shares reveal nothing about the secret,\nand, moreover, this set of shares reveals no information about the identities\nof the players who hold them. On the other hand, any $2k-1$ shares can\nreconstruct the secret without revealing their identities. We also provide\nexplicit constructions of such schemes based on previous works on Reed-Solomon\ncodes correcting insertions and deletions. The constructions in this paper give\nthe first gap threshold secret-sharing schemes that satisfy the strongest\nnotion of anonymity together with perfect reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "The large-scale allocation of public resources (e.g., transportation, energy)\nis among the core challenges of future Cyber-Physical-Human Systems (CPHS). In\norder to guarantee that these systems are efficient and fair, recent works have\ninvestigated non-monetary resource allocation schemes, including schemes that\nemploy karma. Karma is a non-tradable token that flows from users gaining\nresources to users yielding resources. Thus far karma-based solutions\nconsidered the allocation of a single public resource, however, modern CPHS are\ncomplex as they involve the allocation of multiple coupled resources. For\nexample, a user might want to trade-off fast travel on highways for convenient\nparking in the city center, and different users could have heterogeneous\npreferences for such coupled resources. In this paper, we explore how to\noptimally combine multiple karma economies for coupled resource allocations,\nusing two mechanism-design instruments: (non-uniform) karma redistribution; and\n(non-unit) exchange rates. We first extend the existing Dynamic Population Game\n(DPG) model that predicts the Stationary Nash Equilibrium (SNE) of the\nmulti-karma economies. Then, in a numerical case study, we demonstrate that the\ndesign of redistribution significantly affects the coupled resource\nallocations, while non-unit exchange rates play a minor role. To assess the\nallocation outcomes under user heterogeneity, we adopt Nash welfare as our\nsocial welfare function, since it makes no interpersonal comparisons and it is\naxiomatically rooted in social choice theory. Our findings suggest that the\nsimplest mechanism design, that is, uniform redistribution with unit exchange\nrates, also attains maximum social welfare.",

Due to\ntheir nonlinear nature, solving such systems often presents significant\ndifficulties and challenges. In this study, we propose a method utilizing\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the nonlinear energy\nsupply-demand (ESD) system. We design a neural network with four outputs, where\neach output approximates a function that corresponds to one of the unknown\nfunctions in the nonlinear system of differential equations describing the\nfour-dimensional ESD problem. The neural network model is then trained and the\nparameters are identified, optimized to achieve a more accurate solution. The\nsolutions obtained from the neural network for this problem are equivalent when\nwe compare and evaluate them against the Runge-Kutta numerical method of order\n4/5 (RK45). However, the method utilizing neural networks is considered a\nmodern and promising approach, as it effectively exploits the superior\ncomputational power of advanced computer systems, especially in solving complex\nproblems. Another advantage is that the neural network model, after being\ntrained, can solve the nonlinear system of differential equations across a\ncontinuous domain. In other words, neural networks are not only trained to\napproximate the solution functions for the nonlinear ESD system but can also\nrepresent the complex dynamic relationships between the system's components.\nHowever, this approach requires significant time and computational power due to\nthe need for model training.",

Previous statistical models with\ntwo variability sources inherently consider the small MEPs at the low-side\nplateau as part of the neural recruitment properties. However, recent studies\ndemonstrated that small MEP responses under resting conditions are contaminated\nand over-shadowed by background noise of mostly technical quality, e.g., caused\nby the amplifier, and suggested that the neural recruitment curve should\ncontinue below this noise level. This work intends to separate physiological\nvariability from background noise and improve the description of recruitment\nbehaviour. We developed a triple-variability-source model around a logarithmic\nlogistic function without a lower plateau and incorporated an additional source\nfor background noise. Compared to models with two or fewer variability sources,\nour approach better described IO characteristics, evidenced by lower Bayesian\nInformation Criterion scores across all subjects and pulse shapes. The model\nindependently extracted hidden variability information across the stimulated\nneural system and isolated it from background noise, which led to an accurate\nestimation of the IO curve parameters. This new model offers a robust tool to\nanalyse brain stimulation IO curves in clinical and experimental neuroscience\nand reduces the risk of spurious results from inappropriate statistical\nmethods. The presented model together with the corresponding calibration method\nprovides a more accurate representation of MEP responses and variability\nsources, advances our understanding of cortical excitability, and may improve\nthe assessment of neuromodulation effects.",

To address the challenging DCP problem modeled by a loopy\nFG, we propose an effective graph neural network enhanced fast convergent\nparametric MP (GNN--FCPMP) method.

    "abstract": "This paper considers target tracking based on a beacon signal's\ntime-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) to a group of cooperating sensors. The\nsensors receive a reflected signal from the target where the time-of-arrival\n(TOA) renders the distance information. The existing approaches include: (i)\nclassic centralized solutions which gather and process the target data at a\ncentral unit, (ii) distributed solutions which assume that the target data is\nobservable in the dense neighborhood of each sensor (to be filtered locally),\nand (iii) double time-scale distributed methods with high rates of\ncommunication/consensus over the network. This work, in order to reduce the\nnetwork connectivity in (i)-(ii) and communication rate in (iii), proposes a\ndistributed single time-scale technique, which can also handle heterogeneous\nconstant data-exchange delays over the static sensor network. This work assumes\nonly distributed observability (in contrast to local observability in some\nexisting works categorized in (ii)), i.e., the target is observable globally\nover a (strongly) connected network. The (strong) connectivity further allows\nfor survivable network and $q$-redundant observer design. Each sensor locally\nshares information and processes the received data in its immediate\nneighborhood via local linear-matrix-inequalities (LMI) feedback gains to\nensure tracking error stability. The same gain matrix works in the presence of\nheterogeneous delays with no need of redesigning algorithms. Since most\nexisting distributed estimation scenarios are linear (based on consensus), many\nworks use linearization of the existing nonlinear TDOA measurement models where\nthe output matrix is a function of the target position.",

    "abstract": "These recent years have witnessed that convolutional neural network\n(CNN)-based methods for detecting infrared small targets have achieved\noutstanding performance. However, these methods typically employ standard\nconvolutions, neglecting to consider the spatial characteristics of the pixel\ndistribution of infrared small targets. Therefore, we propose a novel\npinwheel-shaped convolution (PConv) as a replacement for standard convolutions\nin the lower layers of the backbone network. PConv better aligns with the pixel\nGaussian spatial distribution of dim small targets, enhances feature\nextraction, significantly increases the receptive field, and introduces only a\nminimal increase in parameters. Additionally, while recent loss functions\ncombine scale and location losses, they do not adequately account for the\nvarying sensitivity of these losses across different target scales, limiting\ndetection performance on dim-small targets. To overcome this, we propose a\nscale-based dynamic (SD) Loss that dynamically adjusts the influence of scale\nand location losses based on target size, improving the network's ability to\ndetect targets of varying scales. We construct a new benchmark, SIRST-UAVB,\nwhich is the largest and most challenging dataset to date for real-shot\nsingle-frame infrared small target detection. Lastly, by integrating PConv and\nSD Loss into the latest small target detection algorithms, we achieved\nsignificant performance improvements on IRSTD-1K and our SIRST-UAVB dataset,\nvalidating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.\n  Code -- https://github.com/JN-Yang/PConv-SDloss-Data",

    "abstract": "Quantum dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator has been extensively studied\nsince the sixties of the last century. Here, with a distinct tool termed the\n``group-theoretical characteristic function\" (GCF), we investigate analytically\nhow a harmonic oscillator immersed in a thermal environment would relax to its\nequilibrium state. We assume that the oscillator is at a pure state initially\nand its evolution is governed by a well-known quantum-optical master equation.\nBy taking advantage of the GCF, the master equation can be transformed into a\nfirst-order linear partial differential equation that allows us to write down\nits solution explicitly. Based on the solution, it is found that, in clear\ncontrast with the monotonic relaxation process of its classical counterpart,\nthe quantum oscillator may demonstrate some intriguing nonmonotonic relaxation\ncharacteristics. In particular, when the initial state is a Gaussian state\n(i.e., a squeezed coherent state), it is found that there is a critical value\nof the environmental temperature, below which the entropy will first increase\nto reach its maximum value, then turn down and converge to its equilibrium\nvalue from above. For the temperature higher than the critical value, the\nentropy will converge to its equilibrium value from below monotonically.\nHowever, when the initial state is a Fock state, it is found that there is a\nnew phase additional to the previous case, where the time curve of entropy\nfeatures two extreme points. Namely, the entropy will increase to reach its\nmaximum first, then turn down to reach its minimum, from where it begins to\nincrease and converges to the equilibrium value eventually.

It is popular in diverse application areas, from medical imaging to\nindustrial process monitoring and tactile sensing, due to its low cost,\nreal-time capabilities and non-ionizing nature. EIT visualizes the conductivity\ndistribution within a body by measuring the boundary voltages, given a current\ninjection. However, EIT image reconstruction is ill-posed due to the mismatch\nbetween the under-sampled voltage data and the high-resolution conductivity\nimage. A variety of approaches, both conventional and deep learning-based, have\nbeen proposed, capitalizing on the use of spatial regularizers, and the\nparadigm of image regression. In this research, a novel method based on the\nconditional diffusion model for EIT reconstruction is proposed, termed CDEIT.\nSpecifically, CDEIT consists of the forward diffusion process, which first\ngradually adds Gaussian noise to the clean conductivity images, and a reverse\ndenoising process, which learns to predict the original conductivity image from\nits noisy version, conditioned on the boundary voltages. Following model\ntraining, CDEIT applies the conditional reverse process on test voltage data to\ngenerate the desired conductivities. Moreover, we provide the details of a\nnormalization procedure, which demonstrates how EIT image reconstruction models\ntrained on simulated datasets can be applied on real datasets with varying\nsizes, excitation currents and background conductivities.

    "abstract": "As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with\nthe optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is\noverloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance.\nWe propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing\nreal-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular\nnetworks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the\nactions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection\npolicies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at\nevery learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are\ndetermined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on\nswapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the\ndistributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by\nparticipating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local\nreward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL\nalgorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel\nvariations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover\ncost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm\nfeatures low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR\nassociation. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed\nprofiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating\ntheir robustness and real-time adaptability.",

Here we connect HBT interferometry to the physics of\nscintillation, the process of spontaneous light emission upon excitation by\nhigh-energy particles, such as x-rays. Our work reveals intrinsic photon\nbunching in the scintillation process, which we utilize to elucidate its\nunderlying light emission mechanisms.

This approach provides\na characterization method that we benchmark on a wide gamut of scintillators,\nincluding rare-earth-doped garnets and perovskite nanocrystals. Our method is\nparticularly important for nano- and micro-scale scintillators, whose\nproperties are challenging to quantify by conventional means: We extract the\nscintillation properties in perovskite nanocrystals of only a few hundreds of\nnanometers, observing strong photon bunching (g^((2) ) (0)>50).

In Stage 2, we utilize a\nprocurement auction mechanism to allocate rewards among base stations, ensuring\nthat those providing high-quality models receive optimal compensation.

These datasets are then used to fine-tune open-source LLMs,\nenhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities without reliance on any\nsymbolic verification program. Concretely, EIT is composed of two critical\nsteps: Enriching with Reasoning Plan (ERP) and Enriching with Reasoning Step\n(ERS). The former generates a high-level plan that breaks down complex\ninstructions into a sequence of simpler objectives, while ERS fills in\nreasoning contexts often overlooked by human annotators, creating a smoother\nreasoning trajectory for LLM fine-tuning.

Here we provide a new PEPS tensor network\nformulation of gauge-invariant theories purely based on symmetric elementary\ntensors. The new formulation can be implemented in numerical simulation using\navailable state-of-the-art tensor network libraries but also holds interest\nfrom a purely theoretical perspective since it requires embedding the original\ngauge theory with gauge symmetry G into an enlarged globally symmetric theory\nwith symmetry GxG. By revisiting the original ansatz in the modern landscape of\ni) duality transformations between gauge and spin systems, ii) finite depth\nquantum circuits followed by measurements that allow generating topologically\nordered states, and iii) Clifford enhanced tensor networks, we show that such a\nnew formulation provides a novel duality transformation between lattice gauge\ntheories and specific sectors of globally invariant systems.",

    "abstract": "As deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely applied in the physical world, many\nresearches are focusing on physical-world adversarial examples (PAEs), which\nintroduce perturbations to inputs and cause the model's incorrect outputs.\nHowever, existing PAEs face two challenges: unsatisfactory attack performance\n(i.e., poor transferability and insufficient robustness to environment\nconditions), and difficulty in balancing attack effectiveness with\nstealthiness, where better attack effectiveness often makes PAEs more\nperceptible.\n  In this paper, we explore a novel perturbation-based method to overcome the\nchallenges. For the first challenge, we introduce a strategy Deceptive RF\ninjection based on robust features (RFs) that are predictive, robust to\nperturbations, and consistent across different models. Specifically, it\nimproves the transferability and robustness of PAEs by covering RFs of other\nclasses onto the predictive features in clean images. For the second challenge,\nwe introduce another strategy Adversarial Semantic Pattern Minimization, which\nremoves most perturbations and retains only essential adversarial patterns in\nAEsBased on the two strategies, we design our method Robust Feature Coverage\nAttack (RFCoA), comprising Robust Feature Disentanglement and Adversarial\nFeature Fusion. In the first stage, we extract target class RFs in feature\nspace. In the second stage, we use attention-based feature fusion to overlay\nthese RFs onto predictive features of clean images and remove unnecessary\nperturbations. Experiments show our method's superior transferability,\nrobustness, and stealthiness compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.\nAdditionally, our method's effectiveness can extend to Large Vision-Language\nModels (LVLMs), indicating its potential applicability to more complex tasks.",

Previous adversarial attacks against ODs have been focused\non designing customized attacks targeting their specific structures (e.g., NMS\nand RPN), yielding some results but simultaneously constraining their\nscalability. Moreover, most efforts against ODs stem from image-level attacks\noriginally designed for classification tasks, resulting in redundant\ncomputations and disturbances in object-irrelevant areas (e.g., background).\nConsequently, how to design a model-agnostic efficient attack to\ncomprehensively evaluate the vulnerabilities of ODs remains challenging and\nunresolved. In this paper, we propose NumbOD, a brand-new spatial-frequency\nfusion attack against various ODs, aimed at disrupting object detection within\nimages. We directly leverage the features output by the OD without relying on\nits internal structures to craft adversarial examples. Specifically, we first\ndesign a dual-track attack target selection strategy to select high-quality\nbounding boxes from OD outputs for targeting. Subsequently, we employ\ndirectional perturbations to shift and compress predicted boxes and change\nclassification results to deceive ODs.

Without resorting to any temperature-dependent parameter, the lattice\nsimulations on the complex heavy-quark potential are well reproduced with the\npotential model in which the screening masses are determined by the background\nfield effective theory. Due to the reduced screening strength near the\ndeconfining temperature, a nontrivial Polyakov loop leads to a dramatic\nincrease in the binding energies, together with a moderate decrease in the\ndecay widths.

In this paper, we consider the $p$-spin generalization of the\nCurie-Weiss model with an external field $h$, and identify three disjoint\nregions almost exhausting the parameter space, with the corresponding Glauber\ndynamics exhibiting three different orders of mixing times in these regions.\nThe construction of these disjoint regions depends on the number of local\nmaximizers of a certain function $H_{\\beta,h,p}$, and the behavior of the\nsecond derivative of $H_{\\beta,h,p}$ at such a local maximizer. Specifically,\nwe show that if $H_{\\beta,h,p}$ has a unique local maximizer $m_*$ with\n$H_{\\beta,h,p}''(m_*) < 0$ and no other stationary point, then the Glauber\ndynamics mixes in time $\\Theta(N\\log N)$, and if $H_{\\beta,h,p}$ has multiple\nlocal maximizers, then the mixing time is $\\exp(\\Omega(N))$.

Finding out the\nexact order of the mixing time on this curve remains an open question.

    "abstract": "It is significantly challenging to recognize daily human actions in homes due\nto the diversity and dynamic changes in unconstrained home environments. It\nspurs the need to continually adapt to various users and scenes. Fine-tuning\ncurrent video understanding models on newly encountered domains often leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting, where the models lose their ability to perform well on\npreviously learned scenarios. To address this issue, we formalize the problem\nof Video Domain Incremental Learning (VDIL), which enables models to learn\ncontinually from different domains while maintaining a fixed set of action\nclasses. Existing continual learning research primarily focuses on\nclass-incremental learning, while the domain incremental learning has been\nlargely overlooked in video understanding. In this work, we introduce a novel\nbenchmark of domain incremental human action recognition for unconstrained home\nenvironments. We design three domain split types (user, scene, hybrid) to\nsystematically assess the challenges posed by domain shifts in real-world home\nsettings. Furthermore, we propose a baseline learning strategy based on replay\nand reservoir sampling techniques without domain labels to handle scenarios\nwith limited memory and task agnosticism. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our simple sampling and replay strategy outperforms most\nexisting continual learning methods across the three proposed benchmarks.",

The presence of negative or nonreal KD distributions may indicate\ncertain quantum features or advantages. If the KD distribution of a quantum\nstate consists solely of positive or zero elements, the state is called a KD\npositive state. Consequently, a crucial inquiry arises regarding the\ndetermination of whether a quantum state is KD positive when subjected to\nvarious physically relevant transition matrices.

To address these challenges, this study proposes a\nPINN-based and Enhanced Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Network. The network\nintroduces a Hierarchical Aggregation Encoder in the backbone, which\nefficiently integrates and globally models multi-scale features through several\nstructural innovations and a novel PCAM module.

Additionally, the loss\nfunction incorporating the PINN mechanism introduces physical constraints\nduring the segmentation process, enhancing the model's ability to accurately\ndelineate tumor boundaries. Comprehensive evaluations on two publicly available\nbreast ultrasound datasets, BUSIS and BUSI, demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms previous segmentation approaches in terms of segmentation\naccuracy and robustness, particularly under conditions of complex noise and low\ncontrast, effectively improving the accuracy and reliability of tumor\nsegmentation.

Previously,\ntheir context window size imposed a limit on the number of examples that can be\nshown, making example selection techniques crucial for identifying the\nmaximally effective set of examples. However, the recent advent of Long Context\nLanguage Models (LCLMs) has significantly increased the number of examples that\ncan be included in context, raising an important question of whether ICL\nperformance in a many-shot regime is still sensitive to the method of sample\nselection. To answer this, we revisit these approaches in the context of LCLMs\nthrough extensive experiments on 18 datasets spanning 4 tasks. Surprisingly, we\nobserve that sophisticated example selection techniques do not yield\nsignificant improvements over a simple random sample selection method. Instead,\nwe discover that the advent of LCLMs has fundamentally shifted the challenge of\nICL from that of selecting the most effective examples to that of collecting\nsufficient examples to fill the context window. Specifically, in certain\ndatasets, including all available examples does not fully utilize the context\nwindow; however, by augmenting the examples in context with a simple data\naugmentation approach, we substantially improve ICL performance by 5%.",

Each component is systematically weighted\nthrough a multi-step Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based framework,\nprioritizing features according to their variance contributions across temporal\nsentiment shifts. This approach dynamically adjusts component importance,\nenabling CSEI to precisely capture high-sensitivity shifts in public sentiment.\nThe development of CSEI showed statistically significant correlations with its\nconstituent features, underscoring internal consistency and sensitivity to\nspecific sentiment dimensions. CSEI's responsiveness was validated using a\ndataset of 4,510,178 Reddit posts about COVID-19. The analysis focused on 15\nmajor events, including the WHO's declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic, the\nfirst reported cases of COVID-19 across different countries, national\nlockdowns, vaccine developments, and crucial public health measures. Cumulative\nchanges in CSEI revealed prominent peaks and valleys aligned with these events,\nindicating significant patterns in public sentiment across different phases of\nthe pandemic. Pearson correlation analysis further confirmed a statistically\nsignificant relationship between CSEI daily fluctuations and these events (p =\n0.0428), highlighting the capacity of CSEI to infer and interpret shifts in\npublic sentiment and engagement in response to major events related to\nCOVID-19.",

    "abstract": "When given two similar images, humans identify their differences by comparing\nthe appearance (e.g., color, texture) with the help of semantics (e.g.,\nobjects, relations). However, mainstream binary change detection models adopt a\nsupervised training paradigm, where the annotated binary change map is the main\nconstraint. Thus, such methods primarily emphasize difference-aware features\nbetween bi-temporal images, and the semantic understanding of changed\nlandscapes is undermined, resulting in limited accuracy in the face of noise\nand illumination variations. To this end, this paper explores incorporating\nsemantic priors from visual foundation models to improve the ability to detect\nchanges. Firstly, we propose a Semantic-Aware Change Detection network\n(SA-CDNet), which transfers the knowledge of visual foundation models (i.e.,\nFastSAM) to change detection. Inspired by the human visual paradigm, a novel\ndual-stream feature decoder is derived to distinguish changes by combining\nsemantic-aware features and difference-aware features. Secondly, we explore a\nsingle-temporal pre-training strategy for better adaptation of visual\nfoundation models. With pseudo-change data constructed from single-temporal\nsegmentation datasets, we employ an extra branch of proxy semantic segmentation\ntask for pre-training. We explore various settings like dataset combinations\nand landscape types, thus providing valuable insights. Experimental results on\nfive challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over the\nexisting state-of-the-art methods.

In turn this equates together the linear\ncategories of representations for various group scheme structures. The tensor\ntriangular spectrum, for representations of a restricted Lie algebra, is known\nto be isomorphic to the scheme of 1-parameter subgroups of the infinitesimal\ngroup scheme structure associated to the Lie algebra. Points in the spectrum of\na tensor triangulated category correspond to minimal radical thick\ntensor-ideals, provided the spectrum is noetherian, as is known in our case of\nfinite group schemes. When the group scheme structure changes from the Lie\nalgebra structure, a set of subgroups can still yield points of the spectrum,\nbut there may not be enough to cover the spectrum. Restricted Lie algebras\nsatisfy our property if, for each group scheme structure, the remaining set of\nsubgroups correspond to minimal radical thick tensor-ideals having identical\nGreen-ring structure to that of the original Lie algebra.

These signals\nproduce unreliable gradients, which hinder the model ability to converge to an\noptimal solution quickly and introduce significant instability into the\noptimization process. In this paper, we seek to resolve these issues from the\nperspective of optimizer design. Unlike prior TTA using manually designed\noptimizers like SGD, we employ a learning-to-optimize approach to automatically\nlearn an optimizer, called Meta Gradient Generator (MGG). Specifically, we aim\nfor MGG to effectively utilize historical gradient information during the\nonline optimization process to optimize the current model. To this end, in MGG,\nwe design a lightweight and efficient sequence modeling layer -- gradient\nmemory layer. It exploits a self-supervised reconstruction loss to compress\nhistorical gradient information into network parameters, thereby enabling\nbetter memorization ability over a long-term adaptation process. We only need a\nsmall number of unlabeled samples to pre-train MGG, and then the trained MGG\ncan be deployed to process unseen samples. Promising results on ImageNet-C, R,\nSketch, and A indicate that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art\nmethods with fewer updates, less data, and significantly shorter adaptation\niterations. Compared with a previous SOTA method SAR, we achieve 7.4% accuracy\nimprovement and 4.2 times faster adaptation speed on ImageNet-C.",

However, this technique also incurs privacy leakage. To\naddress this issue, we propose an innovative scheme based on adversarial attack\nin this paper. The scheme effectively prevents NILM models from violating\nappliance-level privacy, while also ensuring accurate billing calculation for\nusers. To achieve this objective, we overcome two primary challenges. First, as\nNILM models fall under the category of time-series regression models, direct\napplication of traditional adversarial attacks designed for classification\ntasks is not feasible. To tackle this issue, we formulate a novel adversarial\nattack problem tailored specifically for NILM and providing a theoretical\nfoundation for utilizing the Jacobian of the NILM model to generate\nimperceptible perturbations. Leveraging the Jacobian, our scheme can produce\nperturbations, which effectively misleads the signal prediction of NILM models\nto safeguard users' appliance-level privacy. The second challenge pertains to\nfundamental utility requirements, where existing adversarial attack schemes\nstruggle to achieve accurate billing calculation for users. To handle this\nproblem, we introduce an additional constraint, mandating that the sum of added\nperturbations within a billing period must be precisely zero. Experimental\nvalidation on real-world power datasets REDD and UK-DALE demonstrates the\nefficacy of our proposed solutions, which can significantly amplify the\ndiscrepancy between the output of the targeted NILM model and the actual power\nsignal of appliances, and enable accurate billing at the same time.\nAdditionally, our solutions exhibit transferability, making the generated\nperturbation signal from one target model applicable to other diverse NILM\nmodels.",

Traditional calibration methods, dependent on line-of-sight\n(LoS), are slow, costly, and unreliable in seaports and warehouses, making\nlarge-scale localization a significant pain point in the industry. To overcome\nthese challenges, we propose a UWB-LiDAR fusion-based calibration and one-shot\nlocalization framework. Our method uses Gaussian Processes to estimate anchor\nposition from continuous-time LiDAR Inertial Odometry with sampled UWB ranges.\nThis approach ensures accurate and reliable calibration with just one round of\nsampling in large-scale areas, I.e., 600x450 square meter. With the LoS issues,\nUWB-only localization can be problematic, even when anchor positions are known.\nWe demonstrate that by applying a UWB-range filter, the search range for LiDAR\nloop closure descriptors is significantly reduced, improving both accuracy and\nspeed. This concept can be applied to other loop closure detection methods,\nenabling cost-effective localization in large-scale warehouses and seaports.

Motivated by the rebrightening in optical and mid-infrared light\ncurves from ZTF and WISE, we obtained the new spectroscopic observations by\nXinglong 2.16-m, Lijiang 2.4-m, and MMT 6.5-m optical telescopes in 2024.\nResults.

Training with all available visual modalities and\neffectively fusing an arbitrary combination of them is essential for robust\nmulti-modal fusion in semantic segmentation, especially in real-world\nscenarios, yet remains less explored to date. Existing approaches often place\nRGB at the center, treating other modalities as secondary, resulting in an\nasymmetric architecture. However, RGB alone can be limiting in scenarios like\nnighttime, where modalities such as event data excel. Therefore, a resilient\nfusion model must dynamically adapt to each modality's strengths while\ncompensating for weaker inputs.To this end, we introduce the MAGIC++ framework,\nwhich comprises two key plug-and-play modules for effective multi-modal fusion\nand hierarchical modality selection that can be equipped with various backbone\nmodels. Firstly, we introduce a multi-modal interaction module to efficiently\nprocess features from the input multi-modal batches and extract complementary\nscene information with channel-wise and spatial-wise guidance. On top, a\nunified multi-scale arbitrary-modal selection module is proposed to utilize the\naggregated features as the benchmark to rank the multi-modal features based on\nthe similarity scores at hierarchical feature spaces. This way, our method can\neliminate the dependence on RGB modality at every feature granularity and\nbetter overcome sensor failures and environmental noises while ensuring the\nsegmentation performance.

The\nrestricted spatial awareness and perceptual acuity of visual encoders\nfrequently lead to interference from irrelevant background information in\nimages, causing the models to overlook subtle but crucial details. As a result,\nachieving fine-grained regional visual comprehension becomes difficult. In this\npaper, we break down multi-modal understanding into two stages, from Coarse to\nFine (CoF). In the first stage, we prompt the MLLM to locate the approximate\narea of the answer. In the second stage, we further enhance the model's focus\non relevant areas within the image through visual prompt engineering, adjusting\nattention weights of pertinent regions. This, in turn, improves both visual\ngrounding and overall performance in downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Row-level lineage explains what input rows produce an output row through a\ndata processing pipeline, having many applications like data debugging,\nauditing, data integration, etc. Prior work on lineage falls in two lines:\neager lineage tracking and lazy lineage inference. Eager tracking integrates\nlineage tracing tightly into the operator implementation, enabling efficient\ncustomized tracking. However, this approach is intrusive, system-specific, and\nlacks adaptability. In contrast, lazy inference generates additional queries to\ncompute lineage; it can be easily applied to any database, but the lineage\nquery is usually slow. Furthermore, both approaches have limited coverage of\nthe type of data processing pipeline supported due to operator-specific\ntracking or inference rules.\n  In this work, we propose PredTrace, a lineage inference approach that\nachieves easy adaptation, low runtime overhead, efficient lineage querying, and\nhigh pipeline coverage. It achieves this by leveraging predicate pushdown:\npushing a row-selection predicate that describes the target output down to\nsource tables and querying the lineage by running the pushed-down predicate.\nPredTrace may require saving intermediate results when running the pipeline in\norder to compute the precise lineage. When this is not viable, it can still\ninfer lineage but may return a superset. Compared to prior work, PredTrace\nachieves higher coverage on TPC-H queries as well as 70 sampled real-world data\nprocessing pipelines in which UDFs are widely used.

    "abstract": "In our previous work, we have investigated Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) spectra\nand anisotropy from 100 GeV to PeV, under anisotropic propagation model with\naxisymmetric distributed galactic sources. Numerous observational evidence have\nindicated that the Milky Way is a typical spiral galaxy. In this work, we\nfurther utilize anisotropic propagation models with spiral galactic sources to\ninvestigate spectra and anisotropy of CRs. During the calculation process, we\nemploy the spatially dependent diffusion (SDP) model with different diffusion\ncoefficients for the inner and outer halo, while the background CR sources is\nspiral distribution. To better explain the anomalous observations of nuclear\nspectral hardening at $ {\\cal R}\\sim$ 200 GV and the complicated energy\ndependence of anisotropy from GeV to PeV, we introduce the contribution of the\nGeminga nearby source. Additionally, we incorporate the impact of the local\nregular magnetic field (LRMF) and the corresponding anisotropic diffusion on\nlarge-scale anisotropy within the SDP model. By comparing the spiral and\naxisymmetric distribution models of background sources, it is found that both\nof them can well reproduce the CR spectra and anisotropy from 100 GeV-PeV.\nHowever, their propagation parameters are different. The diffusion coefficient\nwith spiral distribution of CR sources is larger than that with axisymmetric\ndistribution, and its spectral indices are also harder. Future high-precision\nmeasurements of CR anisotropy, such as LHAASO experiment, will be crucial in\nevaluating the validity of our proposed model.",

Connected\nvehicles (CVs) are given right-of-way based on prevailing traffic conditions,\nsuch as estimated times of arrival (ETAs) of vehicles, the number of CVs in\ndifferent approaches, and their emissions. These factors are considered in line\nwith the objectives of the VTL application. Aiming to optimize traffic flow by\nreducing delays, VTL generates Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) data for CVs\napproaching an intersection. Our VTL method considers the delay each CV would\ncause for other CVs if given the right-of-way. However, the stochastic nature\nof vehicle arrivals at intersections increases the complexity of the\noptimization problem, making it challenging for classical computers to\ndetermine optimal solutions in real-time. To address this limitation, we\ndevelop a VTL method designed to minimize stopped delays for CVs at an\nintersection by leveraging the efficacies of existing quantum computers that\ndetermine the best outcome from all possible combinations. This method employs\nQuadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), a mathematical framework\ncommonly used in quantum computing, to formulate the VTL problem as a\nstopped-delay-minimization challenge. To evaluate our method for roadway\ntraffic with varying traffic volumes, we integrate an open-source microscopic\nroadway traffic simulator, Simulation for Urban Mobility (SUMO), with a\ncloud-based D-Wave quantum computer.

The prevailing\nmethods typically learn a conservative policy to mitigate the problem of\nQ-value overestimation, but it is prone to overdo it, leading to an overly\nconservative policy. Moreover, they optimize all samples equally with fixed\nconstraints, lacking the nuanced ability to control conservative levels in a\nfine-grained manner. Consequently, this limitation results in a performance\ndecline. To address the above two challenges in a united way, we propose a\nframework, Adaptive Conservative Level in Q-Learning (ACL-QL), which limits the\nQ-values in a mild range and enables adaptive control on the conservative level\nover each state-action pair, i.e., lifting the Q-values more for good\ntransitions and less for bad transitions. We theoretically analyze the\nconditions under which the conservative level of the learned Q-function can be\nlimited in a mild range and how to optimize each transition adaptively.\nMotivated by the theoretical analysis, we propose a novel algorithm, ACL-QL,\nwhich uses two learnable adaptive weight functions to control the conservative\nlevel over each transition. Subsequently, we design a monotonicity loss and\nsurrogate losses to train the adaptive weight functions, Q-function, and policy\nnetwork alternatively.

A single\nAR language model predicts these continuous speech distributions from text,\nwith a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss as the constraint. Experimental results\nshow that KALL-E outperforms open-source implementations of YourTTS, VALL-E,\nNaturalSpeech 2, and CosyVoice in terms of naturalness and speaker similarity\nin zero-shot TTS scenarios.

The case that there\nare exactly $n+1$ isolated fixed points has its importance due to various\nreasons. Besides dimension 2 with 2 fixed points, and dimension 4 with 3 fixed\npoints, which are known, the next interesting case is dimension 6 with 4 fixed\npoints, for which the integral cohomology ring and the total Chern class of the\nmanifold, and the sets of weights of the circle action at the fixed points are\nclassified by Tolman. In this note, we use a new different argument to prove\nTolman's results for the dimension 6 with 4 fixed points case. We observe that\nthe integral cohomology ring of the manifold has a nice basis in terms of the\nmoment map values of the fixed points, and the largest weight between two fixed\npoints is nicely related to the first Chern class of the manifold. We will use\nthese ingredients to determine the sets of weights of the circle action at the\nfixed points, and moreover to determine the global invariants the integral\ncohomology ring and total Chern class of the manifold. The idea allows a direct\napproach of the problem, and the argument is short and easy to follow.",

Since the CDI model is a\nsecond-order partial differential equation, it does not permit a second\n(contact angle) boundary condition, in contrast to the popular fourth-order\nCahn-Hilliard model. As such, we use one-sided stencils and extrapolations from\nthe interior of the domain to compute phase-field-related quantities on and\nnear the wall.

By monitoring,\nanalysing, and evaluating rainfall data at a local level, it is not only\npossible to take effective actions to prevent any severe climate variation but\nalso to improve the planning of surface and underground hydrological resources.\nHowever, developing countries often lack the weather stations to collect data\ncontinuously due to the high cost of installation and maintenance.

Second, we propose a novel approach to regional\nheavy rainfall prediction by implementing graph neural networks (GNNs), which\nare particularly well-suited for capturing the complex spatial dependencies\ninherent in rainfall patterns. The proposed approach was tested using a\nhistorical dataset spanning 72 months, with daily measurements, and\nexperimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in\npredicting heavy rainfall events, making this approach particularly attractive\nfor regions with limited resources or where traditional weather radar or\nstation coverage is sparse.",

However, these probes only and could only reveal critical recall stages\nfor the original answers, while the goal of editing is to rectify model's\nprediction for the target answers. This inconsistency indicates that both the\nprobe approaches and the associated editing methods are deficient. To mitigate\nthe inconsistency and identify critical editing regions, we propose a\ncontrast-based probe approach, and locate two crucial stages where the model\nbehavior diverges between the original and target answers: Information\nEnrichment in low layers and Probability Promotion in high layers.

    "abstract": "Recently, the success of text-to-image synthesis has greatly advanced the\ndevelopment of identity customization techniques, whose main goal is to produce\nrealistic identity-specific photographs based on text prompts and reference\nface images. However, it is difficult for existing identity customization\nmethods to simultaneously meet the various requirements of different real-world\napplications, including the identity fidelity of small face, the control of\nface location, pose and expression, as well as the customization of multiple\npersons. To this end, we propose a scale-robust and fine-controllable method,\nnamely RealisID, which learns different control capabilities through the\ncooperation between a pair of local and global branches. Specifically, by using\ncropping and up-sampling operations to filter out face-irrelevant information,\nthe local branch concentrates the fine control of facial details and the\nscale-robust identity fidelity within the face region. Meanwhile, the global\nbranch manages the overall harmony of the entire image. It also controls the\nface location by taking the location guidance as input. As a result, RealisID\ncan benefit from the complementarity of these two branches. Finally, by\nimplementing our branches with two different variants of ControlNet, our method\ncan be easily extended to handle multi-person customization, even only trained\non single-person datasets. Extensive experiments and ablation studies indicate\nthe effectiveness of RealisID and verify its ability in fulfilling all the\nrequirements mentioned above.",

    "abstract": "As intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a new and promising\ntechnology capable of configuring the wireless environment favorably, channel\nestimation for IRS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has\ngarnered extensive attention in recent years. While various algorithms have\nbeen proposed to address this challenge, there is a lack of rigorous\ntheoretical error analysis. This paper aims to address this gap by providing\ntheoretical guarantees in terms of stable recovery of channel matrices for\nnoisy measurements. We begin by establishing the equivalence between\nIRS-assisted MIMO systems and a compact tensor train (TT)-based\ntensor-on-tensor (ToT) regression. Building on this equivalence, we then\ninvestigate the restricted isometry property (RIP) for complex-valued\nsubgaussian measurements. Our analysis reveals that successful recovery hinges\non the relationship between the number of user terminals (in the uplink\nscenario) or base stations (in the downlink scenario) and the number of time\nslots during which channel matrices remain invariant. Utilizing the RIP\ncondition, we analyze the theoretical recovery error for the solution to a\nconstrained least-squares optimization problem, including upper error bound and\nminimax lower bound, demonstrating that the error decreases inversely with the\nnumber of time slots and increases proportionally with the number of unknown\nelements in the channel matrices. In addition, we extend our error analysis to\ntwo more specialized IRS-assisted MIMO systems, incorporating low-rank channel\nmatrices or an unknown IRS. Furthermore, we explore a multi-hop IRS scheme and\nanalyze the corresponding recovery errors. Finally, we introduce and implement\ntwo nonconvex optimization algorithms--alternating least squares and\nalternating gradient descent--to validate our conclusions through simulations.",

Using a machine learning-based method, we identified nearly a\nthousand such structures, providing new insights into their evolution and\nphysical properties. Statistical analysis shows that these structures are more\nabundant closer to the Sun, with occurrence rates peaking around 30-40 solar\nradii and declining at greater distances, suggesting that they decay.\nHigh-cadence measurements reveal that these structures are predominantly found\nin low-beta environments, with consistent fluctuations in density, velocity,\nand magnetic field. Magnetic field enhancements are often accompanied by plasma\ndensity drops, which, under near pressure balance, limit field increases. This\nleads to small fractional field enhancements near the Sun (approximately 0.01\nat 20 solar radii), making detection challenging.

One major efficiency\nbottleneck is that existing DiTs apply equal computation across all regions of\nan image. However, not all image tokens are equally important, and certain\nlocalized areas require more computation, such as objects. To address this, we\npropose DiffCR, a dynamic DiT inference framework with differentiable\ncompression ratios, which automatically learns to dynamically route computation\nacross layers and timesteps for each image token, resulting in efficient DiTs.\nSpecifically, DiffCR integrates three features: (1) A token-level routing\nscheme where each DiT layer includes a router that is fine-tuned jointly with\nmodel weights to predict token importance scores. In this way, unimportant\ntokens bypass the entire layer's computation; (2) A layer-wise differentiable\nratio mechanism where different DiT layers automatically learn varying\ncompression ratios from a zero initialization, resulting in large compression\nratios in redundant layers while others remain less compressed or even\nuncompressed; (3) A timestep-wise differentiable ratio mechanism where each\ndenoising timestep learns its own compression ratio. The resulting pattern\nshows higher ratios for noisier timesteps and lower ratios as the image becomes\nclearer. Extensive experiments on text-to-image and inpainting tasks show that\nDiffCR effectively captures dynamism across token, layer, and timestep axes,\nachieving superior trade-offs between generation quality and efficiency\ncompared to prior works.

However, the throughput of ECC is still\nhindered by the significant performance overhead associated with elliptic curve\n(EC) operations. This paper presents gECC, a versatile framework for ECC\noptimized for GPU architectures, specifically engineered to achieve\nhigh-throughput performance in EC operations. gECC incorporates batch-based\nexecution of EC operations and microarchitecture-level optimization of modular\narithmetic. It employs Montgomery's trick to enable batch EC computation and\nincorporates novel computation parallelization and memory management techniques\nto maximize the computation parallelism and minimize the access overhead of GPU\nglobal memory. Also, we analyze the primary bottleneck in modular\nmultiplication by investigating how the user codes of modular multiplication\nare compiled into hardware instructions and what these instructions' issuance\nrates are. We identify that the efficiency of modular multiplication is highly\ndependent on the number of Integer Multiply-Add (IMAD) instructions. To\neliminate this bottleneck, we propose techniques to minimize the number of IMAD\ninstructions by leveraging predicate registers to pass the carry information\nand using addition and subtraction instructions (IADD3) to replace IMAD\ninstructions. Our results show that, for ECDSA and ECDH, gECC can achieve\nperformance improvements of 5.56x and 4.94x, respectively, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art GPU-based system.

    "abstract": "To deal with high-dimensional unlabeled datasets in many areas, principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) has become a rising technique for unsupervised feature\nselection (UFS). However, most existing PCA-based methods only consider the\nstructure of datasets by embedding a single sparse regularization or constraint\non the transformation matrix. In this paper, we introduce a novel bi-sparse\nmethod called BSUFS to improve the performance of UFS. The core idea of BSUFS\nis to incorporate $\\ell_{2,p}$-norm and $\\ell_q$-norm into the classical PCA,\nwhich enables our method to select relevant features and filter out irrelevant\nnoises, thereby obtaining discriminative features. Here, the parameters $p$ and\n$q$ are within the range of $[0, 1)$. Therefore, BSUFS not only constructs a\nunified framework for bi-sparse optimization, but also includes some existing\nworks as special cases. To solve the resulting non-convex model, we propose an\nefficient proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm using Stiefel\nmanifold optimization and sparse optimization techniques. In addition, the\ncomputational complexity analysis is presented. Extensive numerical experiments\non synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed BSUFS. The results reveal the advantages of bi-sparse optimization in\nfeature selection and show its potential for other fields in image processing.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/BSUFS.",

Specifically, AI methods were not\neffective in creation of formulas for mathematical constants because each such\nformula must be correct for infinite digits of precision, with \"near-true\"\nformulas providing no insight toward the correct ones. Consequently, formula\ndiscovery lacks a clear distance metric needed to guide automated discovery in\nthis realm.\n  In this work, we propose a systematic methodology for categorization,\ncharacterization, and pattern identification of such formulas.

These metrics\nenable the first automated clustering of mathematical formulas. We demonstrate\nthis methodology on Polynomial Continued Fraction formulas, which are\nubiquitous in their intrinsic connections to mathematical constants, and\ngeneralize many mathematical functions and structures.\n  We test our methodology on a set of 1,768,900 such formulas, identifying many\nknown formulas for mathematical constants, and discover previously unknown\nformulas for $\\pi$, $\\ln(2)$, Gauss', and Lemniscate's constants.

    "abstract": "The development of Mn-rich cathodes for Li-ion batteries promises to\nalleviate supply chain bottlenecks in battery manufacturing. Challenges in\nMn-rich cathodes arise from Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions of Mn$^{3+}$, Mn\nmigration, and phase transformations to spinel-like order, which can affect the\nelectrochemical performance. These phenomena motivate an ab initio\nre-examination of the thermodynamics of the LiMnO2 polymorphs. It is found that\nthe generalized gradient approximation (GGA - PBEsol) and meta-GGA (r2SCAN)\ndensity functionals with empirical on-site Hubbard U corrections yield spurious\nstable phases for LiMnO2, such as predicting a phase with gamma-LiFeO2-like\norder (g-LiMnO2) to be the ground state instead of the orthorhombic (Pmmn)\nphase, which is the experimentally known ground state. Accounting for the\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) order in each structure has a substantial effect on the\ntotal energies and resulting phase stability. By using hybrid-GGA (HSE06) and\nGGA with self-consistent Hubbard parameters (on-site U and inter-site V), the\nexperimentally observed LiMnO2 phase stability trends are recovered. The\ncalculated Hubbard U in the experimentally observed orthorhombic, layered, and\nspinel phases are significantly smaller than U in g-LiMnO2 and disordered\nlayered structures. The smaller values of U are correlated with a collinear\nordering of JT distortions, in which all $e_g$ orbitals are oriented in the\nsame direction. This cooperative JT effect leads to increased Mn-O covalency,\nwhich contributes to the greater electronic stability compared to the phases\nwith noncollinear JT arrangements, and also generate greater vibrational\nentropy, which helps stabilize these phases at high temperature. These phases\nare shown to be strongly insulating with large calculated band gaps > 3 eV,\ncomputed using HSE06 and $G_0W_0$.",

In this work, we systematically\nexamine the interplay between orbital selectivity and magnetism in the newly\ndiscovered anisotropic kagome TbTi3Bi4 single crystal, and report a\nunidirectional, orbital-selective band reconstruction within the\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) state. By combining soft X-ray and vacuum ultraviolet\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements with\norbital-resolved density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify that\nthe band reconstruction is a manifestation of the AFM order, driven by a 1/3\nnesting instability of the intercalated Tb 5dxz orbitals.
