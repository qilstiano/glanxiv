    "abstract": "Cognitive diagnosis (CD) models latent cognitive states of human learners by\nanalyzing their response patterns on diagnostic tests, serving as a crucial\nmachine learning technique for educational assessment and evaluation.\nTraditional cognitive diagnosis models typically follow a transductive\nprediction paradigm that optimizes parameters to fit response scores and\nextract learner abilities. These approaches face significant limitations as\nthey cannot perform instant diagnosis for new learners without computationally\nexpensive retraining and produce diagnostic outputs with limited reliability.\nIn this study, we introduces a novel generative diagnosis paradigm that\nfundamentally shifts CD from predictive to generative modeling, enabling\ninductive inference of cognitive states without parameter re-optimization. We\npropose two simple yet effective instantiations of this paradigm: Generative\nItem Response Theory (G-IRT) and Generative Neural Cognitive Diagnosis Model\n(G-NCDM), which achieve excellent performance improvements over traditional\nmethods. The generative approach disentangles cognitive state inference from\nresponse prediction through a well-designed generation process that\nincorporates identifiability and monotonicity conditions. Extensive experiments\non real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in\naddressing scalability and reliability challenges, especially $\\times 100$\nspeedup for the diagnosis of new learners.

However, their\nrepresentations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two\nhuman experiments systematically manipulating point density and object\norientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2).\nHumans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We\ncompared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural\nnetwork (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with\nhuman performance.

Moreover, they\nlack interpretability, reducing transparency in decision-making. In contrast,\ndynamic time warping (DTW) combined with a nearest neighbor classifier is\nwidely used for its effectiveness in limited-data settings and its inherent\ninterpretability. However, as a non-parametric method, it is not trainable and\ncannot leverage large amounts of labeled data, making it less effective than\nneural networks in rich-resource scenarios. In this work, we aim to develop a\nversatile model that adapts to cold-start conditions and becomes trainable with\nlabeled data, while maintaining interpretability. We propose a dynamic\nlength-shortening algorithm that transforms time series into prototypes while\npreserving key structural patterns, thereby enabling the reformulation of the\nDTW recurrence relation into an equivalent recurrent neural network. Based on\nthis, we construct a trainable model that mimics DTW's alignment behavior. As a\nneural network, it becomes trainable when sufficient labeled data is available,\nwhile still retaining DTW's inherent interpretability.

    "abstract": "Measurement validity in Item Response Theory depends on appropriately\nmodeling dependencies between items when these reflect meaningful theoretical\nstructures rather than random measurement error. In ecological assessment,\ncitizen scientists identifying species across geographic regions exhibit\nsystematic spatial patterns in task difficulty due to environmental factors.\nSimilarly, in Author Recognition Tests, literary knowledge organizes by genre,\nwhere familiarity with science fiction authors systematically predicts\nrecognition of other science fiction authors. Current spatial Item Response\nTheory methods, represented by the 1PLUS, 2PLUS, and 3PLUS model family,\naddress these dependencies but remain limited by (1) binary response\nrestrictions, and (2) conditional autoregressive priors that impose rigid local\ncorrelation assumptions, preventing effective modeling of complex spatial\nrelationships. Our proposed method, Spatial Gaussian Process Item Response\nTheory (SGP-IRT), addresses these limitations by replacing conditional\nautoregressive priors with flexible Gaussian process priors that adapt to\ncomplex dependency structures while maintaining principled uncertainty\nquantification. SGP-IRT accommodates polytomous responses and models spatial\ndependencies in both geographic and abstract cognitive spaces, where items\ncluster by theoretical constructs rather than physical proximity.

However, these systems remain fallback-grade--rural-only,\nbandwidth-limited, and fully dependent on Earth-based mobile cores for\nidentity, session, and policy control. This paper asks a more ambitious\nquestion: Can a complete mobile network, including radio access, core\nfunctions, traffic routing, and content delivery, operate entirely from orbit?\nAnd can it deliver sustained, urban-grade service in the world's densest\ncities? We present the first end-to-end system architecture for a fully orbital\ntelco, integrating electronically steered phased arrays with 1000-beam\ncapacity, space-based deployment of 5G core functions (UPF, AMF), and\ninter-satellite laser mesh backhaul. We analyze spectral efficiency, beam\ncapacity, and link budgets under dense urban conditions, accounting for path\nloss, Doppler, and multipath. Simulations show that rooftop and line-of-sight\nusers can sustain 64-QAM throughput, while street-level access is feasible with\nrelay or assisted beam modes. The paper outlines the remaining constraints,\npower, thermal dissipation, compute radiation hardening, and regulatory models,\nand demonstrates that these are engineering bottlenecks, not physical limits.\nFinally, we propose a staged 15-year roadmap from today's fallback D2D systems\nto autonomous orbital overlays delivering 50-100 Mbps to handhelds in\nmegacities, with zero reliance on terrestrial infrastructure.",

Recent work considers the analogous concept for\ncomputation instead of storage, proposing theoretical constructions.

In this work, we investigate a toy model for the Universal-AND\nproblem which computes the AND of all $m\\choose 2$ pairs of $m$ sparse inputs.\nThe hidden dimension that determines the number of non-linear activations is\nrestricted to pressure the model to find a compute-efficient circuit, called\ncompressed computation. We find that the training process finds a simple\nsolution that does not correspond to theoretical constructions. It is fully\ndense -- every neuron contributes to every output. The solution circuit\nnaturally scales with dimension, trading off error rates for neuron efficiency.\nIt is similarly robust to changes in sparsity and other key parameters, and\nextends naturally to other boolean operations and boolean circuits. We explain\nthe found solution in detail and compute why it is more efficient than the\ntheoretical constructions at low sparsity.

These clusters dynamically evolve across their potential\nenergy landscape, adopting triangular, elongated two-point, single-point, and\nmore spherical configurations often with distinct conical surface protrusions.\nThe manifestation of this instability differs from that observed in mesoscopic\nand microscopic droplets containing macroions, where stable ``star-like''\nstructures form, characterized by a specific number of conical protrusions that\nvaries with the droplet size.

Each region or road segment can be viewed as an\nindividual client that measures local traffic flow, making Federated Learning\n(FL) a suitable approach for collaboratively training models without sharing\nraw data. In centralized FL, a central server collects and aggregates model\nupdates from multiple clients to build a shared model while preserving each\nclient's data privacy. Standard FL methods, such as Federated Averaging\n(FedAvg), assume that clients are independent, which can limit performance in\ntraffic prediction tasks where spatial relationships between clients are\nimportant. Federated Graph Learning methods can capture these dependencies\nduring server-side aggregation, but they often introduce significant\ncomputational overhead.

Analyses of these simulations critically\ndepend on accurately identifying and tracking dark matter subhalos over time.\nIn recent years, several new algorithms have been developed to improve the\naccuracy and consistency of subhalo tracking in cold dark matter simulations.\nThese algorithms should be revisited in the context of new physics beyond\ngravity, which can modify the evolution and final properties of subhalo\npopulations. In this work, we apply the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder\nSymfind to velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter simulations with\nlarge cross section amplitudes to assess the performance of particle-tracking\nmethods beyond the CDM paradigm. We find that the core-particle-tracking\ntechnique, which is key to the success of these algorithms in CDM, does not\nalways yield accurate results in SIDM. The interplay between dark matter\nself-interactions and tidal stripping can cause the diffusion of core particles\nto larger radii, leading particle-tracking-based algorithms to prematurely lose\ntrack of SIDM subhalos. For massive core-expansion subhalos and core-collapse\nsubhalos that experience close or repeated pericentric passages, a significant\nfraction of core particles can be lost, and particle-tracking-based finders\nsuch as Symfind offer no clear advantage over traditional methods that rely on\nidentifying phase-space overdensities. On the other hand, for subhalos with\nlarge pericentric distances or fewer, more distant passages, Symfind tends to\noutperform. These differences depend sensitively on the cross section amplitude\nand turnover velocity of the underlying SIDM model. We therefore recommend a\nhybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both techniques to produce\ncomplete and robust catalogs of core-expansion and core-collapse SIDM subhalos.",

In this paper, we study the behavior of videoconferencing\nsystems in sparse LEO constellations.

To boost RTC performance, we introduce a data-driven queue\nmanagement mechanism that adapts the maximum pacing queue capacity based on\npredicted handover activity. Specifically, our approach employs shorter queue\nlimits during stable, no-handover phases to prioritize low latency\ncommunication, and preemptively increases pacing queue capacity when entering\nperiods of increased handover activity to absorb disruptions.

    "abstract": "Approximate machine unlearning (AMU) enables models to `forget' specific\ntraining data through specialized fine-tuning on a retained (and forget) subset\nof training set. However, processing this large retained subset still dominates\ncomputational runtime, while reductions of unlearning epochs also remain a\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose two complementary methods to accelerate\narbitrary classification-oriented AMU method. First, \\textbf{Blend}, a novel\ndistribution-matching dataset condensation (DC), merges visually similar images\nwith shared blend-weights to significantly reduce the retained set size. It\noperates with minimal pre-processing overhead and is orders of magnitude faster\nthan state-of-the-art DC methods.

A-AMU achieves this by combining a steepened primary loss to\nexpedite forgetting with a differentiable regularizer that matches the loss\ndistributions of forgotten and in-distribution unseen data. Our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that this dual approach of data and loss-centric\noptimization dramatically reduces end-to-end unlearning latency across both\nsingle and multi-round scenarios, all while preserving model utility and\nprivacy.

    "abstract": "Decomposing unitary operations into native gates is an essential step for\nimplementing quantum algorithms. For qubit-based devices, where native gates\nare typically single- and two-qubit operations, a range of decomposition\ntechniques have been developed. In particular, efficient algorithms exist for\ndecomposing exponentials of Pauli strings while taking hardware topology in\naccount. Motivated by the growing interest in qutrit-based quantum computing,\nwe develop analogous decomposition methods for qutrit systems. Specifically, we\nintroduce an algorithm that decomposes the exponential of an arbitrary tensor\nproduct of Weyl-Heisenberg operators (plus their Hermitian conjugation) into\nsingle- and two-qutrit gates. We further extend this approach to unitaries\ngenerated by Gell-Mann string (i.e., a tensor product of Gell-Mann matrices).\nSince both Gell-Mann matrices and Weyl-Heisenberg operators form (together with\nidentity) complete operator bases of qutrit operators, we can use this result\nalso to decompose any multi-qutrit gate that is diagonal up to single-qutrit\nrotations. As a practical application, we use our method to decompose the\nlayers of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for qutrit-based\nimplementations of the graph k-coloring problem. For values of $k$ well-suited\nto qutrit architectures (e.g., $k=3$ or in general $k=3^n$), our approach\nyields significantly shallower circuits compared to qubit-based\nimplementations, an advantage that grows with problem size, while also\nrequiring a smaller total Hilbert space dimension. Finally, we also address the\nrouting challenge in qutrit architectures that arises due to the limited\nconnectivity of the devices. In particular, we generalize the Steiner-Gauss\nmethod, originally developed to reduce CNOT counts in qubit circuit, to\noptimize gate routing in qutrit-based systems.",

First,\nconventional bit-serial approaches cannot simultaneously leverage the sparsity\nof both factors, leading to a complete waste of one factor' s sparsity. Methods\ndesigned to exploit dual-factor sparsity are still in the early stages of\nexploration, facing the challenge of partial product explosion. Second, the\nfluctuation of bit-level sparsity leads to variable cycle counts for MAC\noperations. Existing synchronous scheduling schemes that are suitable for\ndual-factor sparsity exhibit poor flexibility and still result in significant\nunderutilization of MAC units. To address the first challenge, this study\nproposes a MAC unit that leverages dual-factor sparsity through the emerging\nparticlization-based approach. The proposed design addresses the issue of\npartial product explosion through simple control logic, resulting in a more\narea- and energy-efficient MAC unit. In addition, by discarding less\nsignificant intermediate results, the design allows for further hardware\nsimplification at the cost of minor accuracy loss. To address the second\nchallenge, a quasi-synchronous scheme is introduced that adds cycle-level\nelasticity to the MAC array, reducing pipeline stalls and thereby improving MAC\nunit utilization. Evaluation results show that the exact version of the\nproposed MAC array architecture achieves a 29.2% improvement in area efficiency\ncompared to the state-of-the-art bit-sparsity-driven architecture, while\nmaintaining comparable energy efficiency.

We introduce a new approach to clickbait detection datasets\ncreation, by refining the concept limits and annotations criteria, minimizing\nthe subjectivity in the decision as much as possible. Following it, we created\nand release TA1C (for Te Ahorr\\'e Un Click, Spanish for Saved You A Click), the\nfirst open source dataset for clickbait detection in Spanish.

    "abstract": "Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) is an energy-efficient alternative to\ndigital architectures for accelerating machine learning and signal processing\nworkloads. However, its energy efficiency is limited by the high energy cost of\nthe column analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Reducing the ADC precision is\nan effective approach to lowering its energy cost. However, doing so also\nreduces the AIMC's computational accuracy thereby making it critical to\nidentify the minimum precision required to meet a target accuracy. Prior works\noverestimate the ADC precision requirements by modeling quantization error as\ninput-independent noise, maximizing the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio\n(SQNR), and ignoring the discrete nature of ideal pre-ADC signal. We address\nthese limitations by developing analytical expressions for estimating the\ncompute signal-to-noise ratio (CSNR), a true metric of accuracy for AIMCs, and\npropose CACTUS, an algorithm to obtain CSNR-optimal ADC parameters. Using a\ncircuit-aware behavioral model of an SRAM-based AIMC in a 28nm CMOS process, we\nshow that for a 256-dimensional binary dot product, CACTUS reduces the ADC\nprecision requirements by 3b while achieving 6dB higher CSNR over prior\nmethods.

The core control unit is built using an STM32 microcontroller,\nwhich manages user input through a 4x4 matrix keypad and displays operational\ndata on a 16x4 LCD screen via I2C communication. A 12V DC pump motor is used to\nsimulate the fuel dispensing mechanism, precisely controlled via the dual\nH-bridge L298N motor driver. The system is powered by a 11.1V battery and is\ndesigned for ease of deployment and portability.

This project demonstrates how\nembedded systems can be leveraged to build cost-effective, user-friendly, and\nenergy-efficient solutions.

The framework incorporates a daily ranking mechanism that\nprioritizes identified events using quantifiable metrics reflecting timeliness,\nsource credibility, information completeness, and relevance. Experimental\nevaluation on real-world hacker forum data demonstrates that our method\neffectively reduces noise and surfaces high-priority threats, enabling security\nanalysts to mount proactive responses.

To be more specific, we provide a novel algorithmic technique\nallowing one to decompose the group cellular automaton to be studied into a\nfinite number of group cellular automata, some of them defined on abelian\ngroups, while others, if any, defined on products of simple non-abelian\nisomorphic groups.\n  It is worth noting that the groups resulting from the decomposition only\ndepend on the original group and therefore they are completely independent of\nboth the automaton and the property under investigation. As a result, they do\nnot inherit any aspect of the complexity of the automaton under investigation.\n  We prove that the group cellular automata obtained by the decomposition\npreserve dynamical properties and turn out to be much easier to analyze if\ncompared to the original cellular automaton.

This makes them a crucial\nelement in the study of secular evolution. However, the morphology of nuclear\nrings, and their potential correlations with that of the galactic hosts,\nremains an open subject. We examine 52 star-forming nuclear rings from the\nAtlas of Images of NUclear Rings (AINUR) and correlate the overall galaxy\nmorphology, in particular non-axisymmetric features, with the morphology of the\nnuclear ring. We define three different classes of nuclear rings: two-armed\nrings dominated by two dust lanes, twoarms+ rings crowded with secondary dust\nlanes in addition to the two main ones, and many-armed rings with multiple\narmlets of similar prevalence. We employ unsharp-masked Hubble Space Telescope\nimages to study the structure of nuclear rings. We find that two-armed rings\nare more common in early-type grand design galaxies with strong bars. Twoarms+\nrings are related to later-type and more weakly barred galaxies, both grand\ndesign and multi-armed. Lastly, many-armed rings are typically associated with\nlater-type flocculent and multi-armed galaxies with the weakest bars. In\naddition, we examine the regions inside the nuclear rings and observe nuclear\nspirals in 28 galaxies ( 90 % of those galaxies for which the interior of the\nnuclear ring is resolved). We conclude that the global morphology of the host\ngalaxy and, more precisely, the presence and properties of a bar play a\nfundamental role in determining the morphology of the nuclear ring and the\nnuclear region. We suggest that two-armed rings are associated with a 180deg\nstructure forced by a strong bar, many-armed rings are associated with a very\nweak or absent 180deg structure, and twoarms+ rings are found in intermediate\ncases.",

In this Letter, we report the first observational\nevidence for large-scale intrinsic alignments measured from the ellipticity\nautocorrelations, extending out to $100\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$. From the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) and SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey,\nwe analyze, over the redshift range $0.16\\leq z\\leq 0.70$, luminous red galaxy,\nLOWZ, and CMASS galaxy samples, the latter two of which are crossmatched with\nhigh-quality Dark Energy Spectrograph Instrument imaging data.

The resulting correlation for all three samples\nexhibits a clear power-law form. We also show that jointly analyzing the two II\ncorrelations, II($+$) and II($-$), increases the detection significance by\n$\\sim 10\\%$, even though both are derived from the same $E$-mode power\nspectrum.

To address this issue,\nthis paper proposes a computationally efficient approach.

To efficiently solve this problem, a\nparameterized control policy is designed and leveraged to transform the optimal\npower management problem into a parameter estimation problem. We then implement\nthe ensemble Kalman inversion to estimate the optimal parameter set. The\nproposed approach significantly reduces computational requirements due to 1)\nthe much lower dimensionality of the decision parameters and 2) the estimation\ntreatment of the optimal power management problem.

    "abstract": "Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion\nmodels has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation\n(VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can\nbe improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the\ndistribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation\ngradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to\nsuffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform\nan in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model\nand the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA\nand 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their\noptimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score\nmodel looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable\ncorrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable\ntraining in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we\npropose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving\nrise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD).\n$L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff\nfunctionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments\nvalidate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior\nscore distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be\nseamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the brain represents visual information is a fundamental\nchallenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While AI-driven decoding\nof neural data has provided insights into the human visual system, integrating\nmultimodal neuroimaging signals, such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI, remains a critical\nhurdle due to their inherent spatiotemporal misalignment. Current approaches\noften analyze these modalities in isolation, limiting a holistic view of neural\nrepresentation. In this study, we introduce BrainFLORA, a unified framework for\nintegrating cross-modal neuroimaging data to construct a shared neural\nrepresentation. Our approach leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs)\naugmented with modality-specific adapters and task decoders, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance in joint-subject visual retrieval task and has the\npotential to extend multitasking. Combining neuroimaging analysis methods, we\nfurther reveal how visual concept representations align across neural\nmodalities and with real world object perception. We demonstrate that the\nbrain's structured visual concept representations exhibit an implicit mapping\nto physical-world stimuli, bridging neuroscience and machine learning from\ndifferent modalities of neural imaging. Beyond methodological advancements,\nBrainFLORA offers novel implications for cognitive neuroscience and\nbrain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

    "abstract": "Nowadays, as AI-driven manufacturing becomes increasingly popular, the volume\nof data streams requiring real-time monitoring continues to grow. However, due\nto limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to\ndetect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal\nsensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system\nwhile detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been\nproposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider\nonly variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,\nalthough a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on\ninterventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which\nis impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we\nintroduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for\npartially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating\ncausal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves\nfaster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the\ntrained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for\nanomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor\nplacement in large-scale, real-world data streams. Beyond the current\nimplementation, our technique's fundamental insights can be applied to various\nreinforcement learning problems, opening up new possibilities for real-world\ncausality-informed machine learning methods in engineering applications.",

Yet real-world systems exhibit\npronounced input (or system) variability and are observed through noisy,\nlimited data conditions that confound traditional discovery methods that assume\nfixed-coefficient deterministic models. In this work, we theorize that\naccounting for system variability together with measurement noise is the key to\nconsistently discover the governing equations underlying dynamical systems. As\nsuch, we introduce a stochastic inverse physics-discovery (SIP) framework that\ntreats the unknown coefficients as random variables and infers their posterior\ndistribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the\npush-forward of the posterior samples and the empirical data distribution.\nBenchmarks on four canonical problems -- the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey\nsystem (multi- and single-trajectory), the historical Hudson Bay lynx-hare\ndata, the chaotic Lorenz attractor, and fluid infiltration in porous media\nusing low- and high-viscosity liquids -- show that SIP consistently identifies\nthe correct equations and lowers coefficient root-mean-square error by an\naverage of 82\\% relative to the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics\n(SINDy) approach and its Bayesian variant. The resulting posterior\ndistributions yield 95\\% credible intervals that closely track the observed\ntrajectories, providing interpretable models with quantified uncertainty.

In this\nvein, efficient compression becomes increasingly important. Unlike natural\nimage compression, medical image compression prioritizes preserving diagnostic\ndetails and structural integrity, imposing stricter quality requirements and\ndemanding fast, memory-efficient algorithms that balance computational\ncomplexity with clinically acceptable reconstruction quality. Meanwhile, the\nmedical imaging family includes a plethora of modalities, each possessing\ndifferent requirements. For example, 2D medical image (e.g., X-rays,\nhistopathological images) compression focuses on exploiting intra-slice spatial\nredundancy, while volumetric medical image faces require handling intra-slice\nand inter-slice spatial correlations, and 4D dynamic imaging (e.g., time-series\nCT/MRI, 4D ultrasound) additionally demands processing temporal correlations\nbetween consecutive time frames. Traditional compression methods, grounded in\nmathematical transforms and information theory principles, provide solid\ntheoretical foundations, predictable performance, and high standardization\nlevels, with extensive validation in clinical environments. In contrast, deep\nlearning-based approaches demonstrate remarkable adaptive learning capabilities\nand can capture complex statistical characteristics and semantic information\nwithin medical images. This comprehensive survey establishes a two-facet\ntaxonomy based on data structure (2D vs 3D/4D) and technical approaches\n(traditional vs learning-based), thereby systematically presenting the complete\ntechnological evolution, analyzing the unique technical challenges, and\nprospecting future directions in medical image compression.",

    "abstract": "Habitats integrate the abiotic conditions and biophysical structures that\nsupport biodiversity and sustain nature's contributions to people. As these\necosystems face mounting pressure from human activities, accurate,\nhigh-resolution habitat maps are essential for effective conservation and\nrestoration. Yet current maps often fall short in thematic or spatial\nresolution because they must (1) model several mutually exclusive habitat types\nthat co-occur across landscapes and (2) cope with severe class imbalance that\ncomplicate multi-class training. Here, we evaluated how high-resolution remote\nsensing (RS) data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools can improve habitat\nclassification over large geographic extents at fine thematic resolution. Using\nvegetation plots from the European Vegetation Archive, we modelled Level 3\nEUNIS habitats across Europe and assessed multiple modelling strategies against\nindependent validation datasets. Strategies that exploited the hierarchical\nnature of habitat nomenclatures resolved classification ambiguities, especially\nin fragmented landscapes. Integrating multi-spectral (MSI) and synthetic\naperture radar (SAR) imagery, particularly through Earth Observation Foundation\nmodels, enhanced within-formation discrimination and overall performance.\nFinally, ensemble machine learning that corrects class imbalance boosted\naccuracy further. Our methodological framework is transferable beyond Europe\nand adaptable to other classification systems. Future research should advance\ntemporal modelling of dynamic habitats, extend to habitat segmentation and\nquality assessment, and exploit next-generation EO data paired with\nhigher-quality in-situ observations.",

In this typical reheating\nscenario, gravitational waves (GWs) can be produced during inflaton decay, both\nthrough bremsstrahlung and inflaton scattering processes. While GW production\nvia bremsstrahlung dominates near the end of the reheating phase, inflaton\nscattering leads to a non-negligible GW contribution near the maximum\ntemperature of the Universe. The combined GW spectrum from both decay and\nscattering processes lies within the sensitivity range of proposed resonant\ncavity experiments.

Following structured review\nprotocols, 91 peer-reviewed studies from Scopus and Google Scholar were\nanalyzed, focusing explicitly on equity considerations. The findings indicate\nthat current research on EV public charging equity mainly adopted geographic\ninformation systems (GIS), network optimization, behavioral modeling, and\nhybrid analytical frameworks, yet lacks consistent normative frameworks for\nassessing equity outcomes.

We\nvalidate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation\nshowing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled\nlearning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks\nusing noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal\nbehavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to\ncontrol velocity.

    "abstract": "Real-world data is often represented through the relationships between data\nsamples, forming a graph structure. In many applications, it is necessary to\nlearn this graph structure from the observed data. Current graph learning\nresearch has primarily focused on unsigned graphs, which consist only of\npositive edges. However, many biological and social systems are better\ndescribed by signed graphs that account for both positive and negative\ninteractions, capturing similarity and dissimilarity between samples. In this\npaper, we develop a method for learning signed graphs from a set of smooth\nsigned graph signals. Specifically, we employ the net Laplacian as a graph\nshift operator (GSO) to define smooth signed graph signals as the outputs of a\nlow-pass signed graph filter defined by the net Laplacian. The signed graph is\nthen learned by formulating a non-convex optimization problem where the total\nvariation of the observed signals is minimized with respect to the net\nLaplacian. The proposed problem is solved using alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM) and a fast algorithm reducing the per-ADMM iteration\ncomplexity from quadratic to linear in the number of nodes is introduced.\nFurthermore, theoretical proofs of convergence for the algorithm and a bound on\nthe estimation error of the learned net Laplacian as a function of sample size,\nnumber of nodes, and graph topology are provided. Finally, the proposed method\nis evaluated on simulated data and gene regulatory network inference problem\nand compared to existing signed graph learning methods.",

The need for high resolution, data\ntraffic density, widespread use of multimedia applications, and the importance\nof high rate and reliable image transmission in medical and military fields\nnecessitate the design of novel and high-performance wireless image\ntransmission systems. This paper proposes a code index modulation (CIM)-based\nimage transmission (CIM-IT) system that utilizes spreading code index and\nquadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbol for image transmission over a\nwireless channel. The proposed CIM-IT system maps bits to each pixel value of\nthe image to be transmitted and transmits these bits over a wireless channel\nusing a single-input and multiple-output system comprising code index\nmodulation and QAM techniques. At the receiver, the active spreading code index\nand the selected QAM symbol are estimated using a despreading-based maximum\nlikelihood detector, and the corresponding bits are obtained. The image\nconveyed from the transmitter is then reconstructed at the receiver side using\nthe pixel values corresponding to the bits. The obtained noisy image is\nenhanced using important enhancement filters.

    "abstract": "The matrix scaling problem, particularly the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, has\nbeen studied for over 60 years. In practice, the algorithm often yields\nhigh-quality approximations within just a few iterations. Theoretically,\nhowever, the best-known upper bound places it in the class of\npseudopolynomial-time approximation algorithms. Meanwhile, the lower-bound\nlandscape remains largely unexplored. Two fundamental questions persist: what\naccounts for the algorithm's strong empirical performance, and can a tight\nbound on its iteration count be established?\n  For an $n\\times n$ matrix, its normalized version is obtained by dividing\neach entry by its largest entry. We say that a normalized matrix has a density\n$\\gamma$ if there exists a constant $\\rho > 0$ such that one row or column has\nexactly $\\lceil \\gamma n \\rceil$ entries with values at least $\\rho$, and every\nother row and column has at least $\\lceil \\gamma n \\rceil$ such entries.\n  For the upper bound, we show that the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm produces a\nnearly doubly stochastic matrix in $O(\\log n - \\log \\varepsilon)$ iterations\nand $\\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ time for all nonnegative square matrices whose\nnormalized version has a density $\\gamma > 1/2$. Such matrices cover both the\nalgorithm's principal practical inputs and its typical theoretical regime, and\nthe $\\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ runtime is optimal.\n  For the lower bound, we establish a tight bound of\n$\\widetilde{\\Omega}\\left(n^{1/2}/\\varepsilon\\right)$ iterations for positive\nmatrices under the $\\ell_2$-norm error measure. Moreover, for every $\\gamma <\n1/2$, there exists a matrix with density $\\gamma$ for which the algorithm\nrequires $\\Omega\\left(n^{1/2}/\\varepsilon\\right)$ iterations.\n  In summary, our results reveal a sharp phase transition in the Sinkhorn-Knopp\nalgorithm at the density threshold $\\gamma = 1/2$.",

A distinguishing labeling $\\phi$ of\n$G$ colors the vertices of $G$ so that the only automorphism of the labeled\ngraph $(G, \\phi)$ is the identity map. The distinguishing number of $G$,\n$D(G)$, is the fewest number of colors needed to create a distinguishing\nlabeling of $G$. A subset $S$ of vertices is a fixing set of $G$ if the only\nautomorphism of $G$ that fixes every element in $S$ is the identity map. The\nfixing number of $G$, $Fix(G)$, is the size of a smallest fixing set. A fixing\nset $S$ of $G$ can be translated into a distinguishing labeling $\\phi_S$ by\nassigning distinct colors to the vertices in $S$ and assigning another color\n(e.g., the ``null\" color) to the vertices not in $S$.\n  Color refinement is a well-known efficient heuristic for graph isomorphism. A\ngraph $G$ is amenable if, for any graph $H$, color refinement correctly\ndetermines whether $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic or not.

In this paper, we investigate\nhybrid quantum-classical GAN architectures supplemented by transfer learning to\nsystematically examine whether incorporating Variational Quantum Circuits\n(VQCs) into the generator, the discriminator, or both improves performance over\na fully classical baseline. Our findings indicate that fully hybrid models,\nwhich incorporate VQCs in both the generator and the discriminator,\nconsistently produce images of higher visual quality and achieve more favorable\nquantitative metrics compared to their fully classical counterparts.

Due to the\nquadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length,\nthese methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers\nto improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various\naccuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain.\nFirst, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and\ncompares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g.,\npruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs.\nplug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g.,\nViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain\neffective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are\nincreasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these\ngaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token\ncompression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard\nand compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token\ncompression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often\nunderperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only\nprovide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on\nadapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks\nfor edge AI and AI agent applications.",

To model such scenarios, we introduce\nthe novel minimum peak cost flow over time problem, whose objective is to\nminimise the maximum cost at all points in time rather than minimising the\nintegral of costs. We focus on minimising peak costs of temporally repeated\nflows. These are desirable for practical applications due to their simple\nstructure. This yields the minimum-peak-cost temporally repeated flow problem\n(MPC-TRF).\n  We show that the simple structure of temporally repeated flows comes with the\ndrawback of arbitrarily bad approximation ratios compared to general flows over\ntime. Furthermore, our complexity analysis shows the integral version of\nMPC-TRF is strongly NP-hard, even under strong restrictions. On the positive\nside, we identify two benign special cases: unit-cost series-parallel networks\nand networks with time horizon at least twice as long as the longest path in\nthe network (with respect to the transit time). In both cases, we show that\nintegral optimal flows if the desired flow value equals the maximum flow value\nand fractional optimal flows for arbitrary flow values can be found in\npolynomial time.

    "abstract": "Text classification plays a pivotal role in edge computing applications like\nindustrial monitoring, health diagnostics, and smart assistants, where low\nlatency and high accuracy are both key requirements. Generative classifiers, in\nparticular, have been shown to exhibit robustness to out-of-distribution and\nnoisy data, which is an extremely critical consideration for deployment in such\nreal-time edge environments. However, deploying such models on edge devices\nfaces computational and memory constraints. Post Training Quantization (PTQ)\nreduces model size and compute costs without retraining, making it ideal for\nedge deployment. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative study of\ngenerative and discriminative Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based text\nclassification models with PTQ using the Brevitas quantization library. We\nevaluate both types of classifier models across multiple bitwidths and assess\ntheir robustness under regular and noisy input conditions. We find that while\ndiscriminative classifiers remain robust, generative ones are more sensitive to\nbitwidth, calibration data used during PTQ, and input noise during quantized\ninference. We study the influence of class imbalance in calibration data for\nboth types of classifiers, comparing scenarios with evenly and unevenly\ndistributed class samples including their effect on weight adjustments and\nactivation profiles during PTQ. Using test statistics derived from\nnonparametric hypothesis testing, we identify that using class imbalanced data\nduring calibration introduces insufficient weight adaptation at lower bitwidths\nfor generative LSTM classifiers, thereby leading to degraded performance. This\nstudy underscores the role of calibration data in PTQ and when generative\nclassifiers succeed or fail under noise, aiding deployment in edge\nenvironments.",

This\napproach was simulated in PennyLane and applied to solve a 1D benchmark case of\nMaxwell's equations in free space, with a Gaussian pulse as the initial\ncondition, where the quantum-computed solution showed high fidelity of more\nthan 99.9% when compared to the normalized classical solution.

The agents learn sequentially in some order consistent\nwith a topological sort of the DAG, committing to a model mapping observations\nto predictions of the real-valued label. Each agent observes the predictions of\ntheir parents in the DAG, and trains their model using both the features of the\ninstance that they directly observe, and the predictions of their parents as\nadditional features.

Various deep learning\napproaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have\nbeen developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).\nHowever, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and\nmonocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its\nconversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of\nprompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract\nestimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a\nframework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for\nabsolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution\nShuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and\nhigh-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program\n(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived\nDEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM\nestimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x\nresolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of\nmagnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust\ngeneralization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with\n< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%.

We develop a three-dimensional, sharp and conservative numerical\nmethod for modeling insoluble surfactant-laden interfacial flows within a\nvolume-of-fluid framework. This method contrasts with diffusive transport\nalgorithms commonly employed in the Eulerian framework. The proposed method\npreserves the zero-thickness property of the interface, ensures accurate\ncalculation of the surfactant concentration, and robustly handles complex\ntopological changes. The interface evolution is captured using a geometrical\nvolume-of-fluid method, with surfactant mass sharply stored at the\nreconstructed interface. The advection term in the surfactant transport\nequation is discretized implicitly in conjunction with the geometrical\nadvection of the volume fraction of one of the fluids, thereby eliminating\nnumerical inconsistencies arising from discrepancies between the actual and\ncomputed interface areas. Additionally, the diffusion term is discretized along\nthe reconstructed interface, preventing artificial diffusion normal to the\nzero-thickness interface. Benchmark tests demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieves higher accuracy and faster convergence compared to existing diffusive\napproaches. Finally, we apply the method to investigate the interaction of a\nsurfactant-laden rising bubble with a vertical wall, revealing a transition\nfrom near-wall bouncing to migration away from the wall as the surfactant\nconcentration increases.",

We also conducted a moderator analysis to investigate\nhow predictor importance changes with context (e.g., success definition).\n  Results: Our aggregate analysis reveals that the most consistently powerful\npredictors are a quartet of foundational attributes: Firm Characteristics\n(e.g., age, location), Investor Structure (e.g., investor quality), Digital and\nSocial Traction (e.g., online momentum), and Funding History. The moderator\nanalysis further reveals that this hierarchy is highly context-dependent. For\ninstance, predicting near-term funding milestones elevates the importance of\nthe deal's immediate context, while predicting long-term exits prioritizes\nfundamental firm and investor characteristics.\n  Conclusion: The factors that best predict startup success are not universal\nbut are contingent on the startup's goals, stage, and the data used for\nevaluation. Our findings point to a potential \"convenience bias\" in the\nliterature, where predictor importance may be tied to data accessibility. We\nconclude by underscoring the need for standardized reporting practices to\nenable more robust, cumulative knowledge building in the field.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the circumstances which allow a black hole to remain put at\nthe galactic centre when the stellar core is anisotropic. We use N-body\ncalculations to study the response of stellar orbit families embedded in a\nlarger, isotropic isochrone (H\\'enon) background potential. When the BH orbits\nin an odd f[E,Lz] velocity distribution function, they transfer angular\nmomentum to it. We call this dynamical traction: it takes place whenever the\nkinetic energy drawn from f[E,Lz] has an excess of streaming motion over its\n(isotropic) v-dispersion. For a dynamically cold disc, the outcome depends on\nboth the orbit of the BH and that of a Jeans-unstable stellar sub-structures.\nWhen the stellar clumps have much binding energy, a BH may scatter off of them\nafter they formed. In the process the BH may be dislodged from the centre and\nmigrate outward due to dynamical traction. When the stellar clumps are less\nbound, they may still migrate to the centre where they either dissolve or merge\nwith the BH. The final configuration is similar to a nuclear star cluster which\nmay yet be moving at ~10 km/s wrt the barycentre.\n  The angular momentum transferred to a BH by dynamical traction delays the\nmigration to the galactic centre by several hundred million years. The\nefficiency of angular momentum transfer is a strong function of the fragmented\n(cold) state of the stellar space density. In a dynamically cold environment, a\nBH is removed from the central region through a two-stage orbital migration\ninstability. A criterion against this instability is proposed in the form of a\nthreshold in isotropic velocity dispersion compared to streaming motion. For a\nBH to settle at the heart of a galaxy on time-scales of ~ 300 Myr or less\nrequires that a large fraction of Lz be dissipated, or, alternatively, that the\nBH grows in situ in an isotropic environment devoid of sub-structures.",

    "abstract": "System-level design, once the province of board designers, has now become a\ncentral concern for chip designers. Because chip design is a less forgiving\ndesign medium -- design cycles are longer and mistakes are harder to correct --\nsystem-on-chip designers need a more extensive tool suite than may be used by\nboard designers and a variety of tools and methodologies have been developed\nfor system-level design of systems-on-chips (SoCs). System-level design is less\namenable to synthesis than are logic or physical design. As a result,\nsystem-level tools concentrate on modeling, simulation, design space\nexploration, and design verification. The goal of modeling is to correctly\ncapture the system's operational semantics, which helps with both\nimplementation and verification. The study of models of computation provides a\nframework for the description of digital systems. Not only do we need to\nunderstand a particular style of computation, such as dataflow, but we also\nneed to understand how different models of computation can reliably communicate\nwith each other. Design space exploration tools, such as hardware/software\nco-design, develop candidate designs to understand trade-offs. Simulation can\nbe used not only to verify functional correctness but also to supply\nperformance and power/energy information for design analysis. This chapter\nemploys two applications -- video and neural networks -- as examples. Both are\nleading-edge applications that illustrate many important aspects of\nsystem-level design.",

The light-curve asymmetries appear to be related to the stars'\nthird dredge-up (3DUP) activity. Aims: We aim to reveal the evolutionary status\nof M-type Miras with light-curve asymmetries ('bumps') within the spectral\nsequence M -- S -- C, determine their mass-loss properties, and check possible\nevolutionary scenarios. Methods: We analysed a sample of 3100 Miras collected\nfrom the ASAS database, distinguishing between symmetric and asymmetric light\ncurves. We determined their periods, luminosity functions, and\nperiod-luminosity relations, their locations relative to the Galactic midplane,\nas well as mass-loss rate indicators through the 2MASS-WISE colours and the\nGaia-2MASS diagram. Results: The M-type Miras with symmetric light curves are\ngenerally found to have shorter periods, lower luminosities, a larger average\ndistance to the Galactic midplane, and lower initial masses than the M-type\nMiras with asymmetries. In addition, 25 Miras are proposed as candidates for\nnew carbon stars. Conclusions: We propose that the M-type Miras have two\ndistinct populations: M-type Miras with symmetric light curves, which have\nlower initial mass progenitors than M-type Miras with asymmetries, which show\nsigns of 3DUP activity and are the link to the S-type Miras.",

Third, we argue that this motivates the need for\nnegatively-correlated sampling when generating candidate sets, and we show that\nsimple prompt-based techniques for doing so significantly enhance the\nperformance of alignment methods in learning heterogeneous preferences. Fourth,\nbased on this novel candidate sampling approach, we collect and open-source\nCommunity Alignment, the largest and most representative multilingual and\nmulti-turn preference dataset to date, featuring almost 200,000 comparisons\nfrom annotators spanning five countries.

    "abstract": "For decades, researchers and practitioners typically measure macroscopic\ntraffic flow variables, i.e., density, flow, and speed, using time or space\ncuts, and then construct the fundamental diagrams of traffic flow. With the\nadvent of large-scale vehicle trajectory datasets, often capturing 100 % of\nvehicle dynamics, Edie's generalized definitions have become widely recognized\nas the most appropriate framework for measuring these variables. However, while\nEdie's formulation explicitly requires the traffic state within the measurement\nregion to be both stationary and homogeneous, there is little guidance on how\nto systematically identify such qualified regions and construct the\ncorresponding fundamental diagrams. To address this gap, this paper proposes an\nEdie's definition-based method for measuring traffic variables and constructing\nthe fundamental diagrams of traffic flow by automatically identifying\nstationary traffic states using parallelogram-shaped aggregation regions. An\nopen-source tool is developed and released to support both researchers and\npractitioners.

Furthermore, the Koopman model structure includes an\ninnovation noise term that is used to handle process and measurement noise.

These\nphenomena have been extensively studied - both individually and within a\nunified framework - using the first quantization approach, but only separately\nin the context of quantum field theory. In this work, we address this gap by\ndeveloping a quantum field theory treatment of flavor-chiral oscillations.\nFocusing on the case of two-flavor mixing, we compute the expectation values of\nthe (non-conserved) chiral-flavor charges and recover the same oscillation\nformulas obtained in the first quantization formalism. These charges are\ndiagonalized via Bogoliubov transformations in both the chiral and flavor\nsectors. Such transformations reveal a non-trivial structure of the\nchiral-flavor vacuum, which consists of a condensate of particles with definite\nmasses and helicities.",

We show that a process\nadmits a Laplace dual if and only if it satisfies a certain complete\nmonotonicity condition. Moreover, we analyse how the conventions adopted for\nthe values of $0 \\cdot \\infty$ and $\\infty \\cdot 0$ are reflected in the weak\ncontinuity/absorptivity properties of the processes in duality at the\nboundaries $0$ and $\\infty$. A broad class of generators admitting Laplace\nduals is identified, and we provide sufficient conditions under which the\nassociated martingale problems are well-posed, the solutions being in duality\nat the level of their semigroups. Laplace duality is shown to unify several\ngeneralizations of continuous-state branching processes, e.g. those with\nimmigration or evolving in random environments. Along the way, a theorem\noriginally due to Ethier and Kurtz -- connecting duality of generators to that\nof the associated semigroups -- is refined, and we provide a concise proof of\nthe Courr\\`ege form for the generators of positive Markov processes whose\npointwise domain includes the exponential functions.

However, conventional ab\ninitio molecular dynamics (AIMD) cannot effectively capture anisotropic stress\neffects, which are believed to play a key role in the transformation of GC into\namorphous diamond under extreme conditions. In this work, we present an\non-the-fly machine learning-augmented constrained AIMD (ML-augmented CAIMD)\napproach by modifying VASP 6.3.2. Our simulations not only reproduce major\nexperimental features of GC but also provide restrictive synthesis conditions\nand microscopic insights. We show that GC exhibits unexpectedly high\nplasticity, with its compressive and shear strengths enhanced by large strains.\nUnder pressure, increasing annealing temperature promotes the formation of\nquenchable amorphous diamond via enhanced sp3 preservation, but this trend\nreverses above 2900 K due to thermal graphitization. Under non-hydrostatic\ncompression, GC transforms into a superhard structure sustaining large stress\ndifferences, which sharply increase when confining pressure exceeds 40 GPa.\nFinally, severe rotational shear at 30 GPa induces sp3 fractions up to 80\npercent at 300 to 1000 K. A hardened amorphous carbon retaining 64 percent sp3\ncontent is achieved by decompression at 300 K, marking the lowest\npressure-temperature route ever predicted.

While machine learning methods like Multilayer\nPerceptrons have been used to accurately predict the asymptotic outcomes of\nFFCs, their 'black-box' nature limits the extraction of direct physical\ninsight.

    "abstract": "Symmetries are a key tool in understanding quantum systems, and, among many\nother things, can be exploited to increase the efficiency of numerical\nsimulations of quantum dynamics. Disordered systems usually feature reduced\nsymmetries and additionally require averaging over many realizations, making\ntheir numerical study computationally demanding. However, when studying\nquantities linear in the time-evolved state, i.e. expectation values of\nobservables, one can apply the averaging procedure to the time evolution\noperator, resulting in an effective dynamical map, which restores symmetry at\nthe level of super operators. In this work, we develop schemes for efficiently\nconstructing symmetric sectors of the disorder-averaged dynamical map using\nshort-time and weak-disorder expansions. To benchmark the method, we apply it\nto an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in the presence of a\ntransverse field. After disorder averaging, this system becomes effectively\npermutation-invariant, and thus the size of the symmetric subspace scales\npolynomially in the number of spins allowing for the simulation of large\nsystem.",

This article aims to provide a holistic and comprehensive\ntechnical and historical tutorial on Wi-Fi, beginning with IEEE 802.11b (Wi-Fi\n1) and looking forward to IEEE 802.11bn (Wi-Fi 8). This is the first tutorial\narticle to span these eight generations. Rather than a generation-by-generation\nexposition, we describe the key mechanisms that have advanced Wi-Fi. We begin\nby discussing spectrum allocation and coexistence, and detailing the IEEE\n802.11 standardization cycle. Second, we provide an overview of the physical\nlayer and describe key elements that have enabled data rates to increase by\nover 1,000x. Third, we describe how Wi-Fi Medium Access Control has been\nenhanced from the original Distributed Coordination Function to now include\ncapabilities spanning from frame aggregation to wideband spectrum access.\nFourth, we describe how Wi-Fi 5 first broke the one-user-at-a-time paradigm and\nintroduced multi-user access. Fifth, given the increasing use of mobile,\nbattery-powered devices, we describe Wi-Fi's energy-saving mechanisms over the\ngenerations. Sixth, we discuss how Wi-Fi was enhanced to seamlessly aggregate\nspectrum across 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands to improve throughput,\nreliability, and latency. Finally, we describe how Wi-Fi enables nearby Access\nPoints to coordinate in order to improve performance and efficiency. In the\nAppendix, we further discuss Wi-Fi developments beyond 802.11bn, including\nintegrated mmWave operations, sensing, security and privacy extensions, and the\nadoption of AI/ML.",

Third, we develop\nHybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation\nstrategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we\npresent Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which\nlocalizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling\nonly in detected regions.

    "abstract": "The choice of interface conditions for coupling free-flow and porous-medium\nflow systems is crucial in order to obtain accurate coupled flow models and\nprecise numerical simulation results. Typically, the Stokes equations are\nconsidered in the free-flow region, Darcy's law is applied in the porous\nmedium, and traditional coupling conditions (conservation of mass, balance of\nnormal forces, the Beavers-Joseph condition on tangential velocity) are set on\nthe interface. However, these traditional conditions are applicable to flows\nparallel to the fluid-porous interface only. Recently, we derived generalized\ninterface conditions accounting for arbitrary flow directions to the porous\nlayer using homogenization and boundary layer theory. We validated these\nconditions numerically and demonstrated that they are more accurate than the\ntraditional coupling conditions. However, error estimates have not been derived\nyet. In this paper, we extend the generalized coupling conditions and prove\nrigorous error estimates for the homogenization result. All effective\nparameters appearing in the developed higher-order interface conditions are\ncomputed numerically based on the pore geometry. We validate the derived\nconditions by comparing numerical simulation results for the coupled\nStokes-Darcy model and the pore-scale resolved model. Moreover, we compare the\nnew coupling conditions to the traditional as well as generalized interface\nconditions and highlight the importance of the additional higher-order terms\nappearing in the derived coupling concept.",

    "abstract": "Wire-arc directed energy deposition (DED) has emerged as a promising additive\nmanufacturing (AM) technology for large-scale structural engineering\napplications. However, the complex thermal dynamics inherent to the process\npresent challenges in ensuring structural integrity and mechanical properties\nof fabricated thick walls and plates. While finite element method (FEM)\nsimulations have been conventionally employed to predict thermal history during\ndeposition, their computational demand remains prohibitively high for actual\nlarge-scale applications. Given the necessity of multiple repetitive\nsimulations for heat management and the determination of an optimal printing\nstrategy, FEM simulation quickly becomes entirely infeasible. Instead,\nadvancements have been made in using trained neural networks as surrogate\nmodels for rapid prediction. However, traditional data-driven approaches\nnecessitate large amounts of relevant and verifiable external data, during the\ntraining and validation of the neural network. Regarding large-scale wire-arc\nDED, none of these data sources are readily available in quantities sufficient\nfor an accurate surrogate. The introduction of physics-informed neural networks\n(PINNs) has opened up an alternative simulation strategy by leveraging the\nexisting physical knowledge of the phenomena with advanced machine learning\nmethods. Despite their theoretical advantages, PINNs have seen limited\napplication in the context of large-scale wire-arc DED for structural\nengineering. This study investigates the scalability of PINNs, focusing on\nefficient collocation points sampling, a critical factor controlling both the\ntraining time and model performance. Results show PINNs can reduce\ncomputational time and effort by up to 98.6%, while maintaining the desired\naccuracy and offering \"super-resolution\". Future directions for enhancing PINN\nperformance in metal AM are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Active galactic nuclei (AGNs), among the universe's most luminous objects,\nradiate across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. They are powered by\ngravitational energy released from material feeding central supermassive black\nholes (SMBHs). However, current AGN theory remains largely phenomenological,\nrelying on envisioned structures beyond accretion disks to produce broad\noptical emission lines (broad line regions, BLRs) and X-ray emission (corona).\nIt struggles to explain accretion disk sizes, optical line diversity, BLR\nradial inflows/outflows, and crucially, rapid X-ray and optical variability\n(line width, line shape, inflow/outflow switch, emitting region) on timescales\nsignificantly shorter than disk accretion. Here we show that moderately\neccentric flows around SMBHs-formed via circumnuclear gas accretion or tidal\ndisruption events-generate eccentricity cascades in the BLRs (from 0.8 to 0.2\noutwards), explaining multi-wavelength emission and variability. The flows'\nnon-axisymmetric temperature structures explain dust sublimation asymmetries,\ndifferent BLR components and their radial motions. The innermost BLR links to\nthe SMBH vicinity through highly eccentric streams producing soft X-rays at\nperiapsis. General relativistic precession further compresses these flows,\ngenerating a hard X-ray continuum near the SMBHs. Precession of the eccentric\nflow drives optical/X-ray variability, reproducing the observed X-ray power\nspectral density and occasional X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions. We thus propose\neccentric accretion disks as a physical AGN model unifying the elusive BLRs and\nX-ray corona.

SIMs benefit from\nflexible spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) while reducing the requirement for\ncostly radio-frequency (RF) chains. However, current state-of-the-art SIM\ndesigns face challenges such as complex phase shift optimization and energy\nattenuation from multiple layers. To address these aspects, we propose\nincorporating meta-fibers into SIMs, with the aim of reducing the number of\nlayers and enhancing the energy efficiency. First, we introduce a\nmeta-fiber-connected 2-layer SIM that exhibits the same flexible signal\nprocessing capabilities as conventional multi-layer structures, and explains\nthe operating principle. Subsequently, we formulate and solve the optimization\nproblem of minimizing the mean square error (MSE) between the SIM channel and\nthe desired channel matrices. Specifically, by designing the phase shifts of\nthe meta-atoms associated with the transmitting-SIM and receiving-SIM, a\nnon-interference system with parallel subchannels is established. In order to\nreduce the computational complexity, a closed-form expression for each phase\nshift at each iteration of an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is\nproposed. We show that the proposed algorithm is applicable to conventional\nmulti-layer SIMs. The channel capacity bound and computational complexity are\nanalyzed to provide design insights.

In addition, the proposed\nmodel costs fewer computing resources than the baselines. These results show\nthat the BiMamba architecture is effective for solving key challenges in SELD\ntasks.

    "abstract": "Silver (Ag) is considered an ideal material for plasmonic applications in the\nvisible wavelength regime due to its superior optical properties, but its use\nis limited by the poor chemical stability and structural quality of thermally\nevaporated thin films and resulting nanostructures. In this study, we present a\nsimple approach to enhance the structural and optical quality as well as the\nchemical stability of Ag thin films by alloying with gold (Au) through thermal\nco-evaporation. We investigate Ag$_{100-x}$Au$_x$ thin films with Au contents\nranging from 5 to 20 at% analyzing their surface morphology, crystallite\nstructure, optical properties, and chemical stability. Our results show that\nlow Au concentrations significantly reduce the roughness of co-evaporated thin\nfilms (down to 0.4 nm RMS), and significantly enhance the resistance to\noxidation, while maintaining a defined crystallite growth. Importantly, these\nimprovements are achieved without the need for template stripping, metallic\nwetting layers, or epitaxial substrates, enabling direct deposition on glass.\nAmong the compositions studied, Ag$_{95}$Au$_5$ thin films exhibit the highest\nchemical stability, lowest optical losses in the visible spectral range, and\nexcellent plasmonic properties even outcompeting pure Ag. As a\nproof-of-concept, we fabricate high-quality Ag$_{95}$Au$_5$ optical antennas\nthat exhibit long-term durability under ambient conditions. Our approach\nprovides a practical solution to overcome the limitations of Ag for plasmonic\ndevice applications.",

The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for\nhigh-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the\nimportance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints\noverall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for\ndistal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur\nlarger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation\nand degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we\npropose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation\n(EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the\neffect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the\npredictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key\nstages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions\nof the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint\nconfiguration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a\ndual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the\nremaining joints.

In this paper,\nwe combined Cosmic Microwave Background data with upper or lower limits of the\nstochastic gravitational wave background provided by FAST or SKA, to constrain\nscalar-induced gravitational waves. To provide a comprehensive forecast, we\nconsider two scenarios: one where FAST or SKA does not detect scalar-induced\ngravitational waves, thereby setting an upper limit on the fractional energy\ndensity; and another where these waves are detected successfully, thus\nestablishing a lower limit on the fractional energy density.

The\nconstraint shifts to $n_s = 0.9661^{+0.0027}_{-0.0039}$ in the lower limit\nscenario. Comparing with the constraint from the combinations of CMB+BAO\ndatasets, the scalar spectral index $n_s$ exhibits significant changes, which\ncould serve as an indicator for detecting scalar-induced gravitational waves.\nIn the $\\Lambda$CDM+$\\alpha_s$+$r$ model and the\n$\\Lambda$CDM+$\\alpha_s$+$\\beta_s$+$r$ model, the running of the scalar spectral\nindex $\\alpha_s$ and the running of the running of the scalar spectral index\n$\\beta_s$ also show notable variations, suggesting potential indicators.

A central\nquestion to be answered is whether the hemoglycin rod lattice with diamond 2H\nsymmetry represents the most efficient covering of space by a regular\narrangement of identical rods. Starting from the tetrahedral symmetry of every\nhemoglycin lattice vertex we find that the regular truncated tetrahedron of\nArchimedes may be expanded until neighboring hexagon faces are coincident, at\nwhich point space filling is 23/24 or 95.8333% complete.

Maximum space filling\nvia a minimum of molecular material can allow hemoglycin to drive accretion in\nmolecular clouds, contributing to the composition of dust, and providing a\nbackground for its widespread presence in meteoritic samples and in cometary\nmaterial that falls to Earth.

In particular, the\n(hyper)clusters are fixed by solving the Dirac equations imposing the\nDirichlet-Neumann boundary condition, while the nuclear matter take constant\ndensities and is treated with Thomas-Fermi approximation. The binding energies\nof (hyper)clusters decrease with the density of nuclear matter\n$n_{\\mathrm{gas}}$, which eventually become unbound and melt in the presence of\nnuclear medium, i.e., Mott transition. For light clusters with proton numbers\n$N_p < 4$, with the addition of $\\Lambda$ hyperons, the binding energies per\nbaryon for $\\Lambda$ hyperclusters become smaller and decrease faster with\n$n_{\\mathrm{gas}}$ due to the weaker $N$-$\\Lambda$ attraction. For heavy\nclusters with $N_p \\geq 4$, on the contrary, the addition of $\\Lambda$ hyperons\nincreases the stability of (hyper)clusters so that the Mott transition density\nbecomes larger as nucleons occupying higher energy states while $\\Lambda$\nhyperons remain in the $1s_{1/2}$ orbital. The isovector effects on\n(hyper)clusters in nuclear medium are also identified, where the binding\nenergies for (hyper)clusters with $N_p> N_n$ ($N_p< N_n$) increase (decrease)\nwith $Y_p$. For those predicted by nonlinear relativistic density functionals,\nlight (hyper)clusters are destabilized drastically as $n_{\\mathrm{gas}}$\nincreases, while the binding energies of heavier (hyper)clusters vary smoothly\nwith $n_{\\mathrm{gas}}$. By fitting the binding energy shifts to an analytical\nformula, the corresponding coefficients describing the in-medium properties of\nvarious (hyper)clusters are fixed, which should be useful to understand the\nevolutions of (hyper)clusters in both heavy-ion collisions and neutron stars.",

These\nmodels typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small\ntargets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance\nand efficiency gains.

Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods\nthat rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a\ndynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables\nthe model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the\ninput scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse\nbackgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to\nbetter capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more\naccurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets.\nExtensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that\nDRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in\ndetection accuracy.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a solution for collaborative medical image\nclassification while preserving data privacy. However, label noise, which\narises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training\ninstability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with\nnoise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these\nchallenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in\nnoisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates\nnoise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity\nand improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive\nAdjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label\ngeneration and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class\ndistributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully\nmanaging noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual\napproach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during\nlocal training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate\nFedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical\ndatasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric,\nextreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise\nscenarios. Moreover, FedGSCA demonstrates significant advantages in improving\nmodel stability and handling complex noise, making it well-suited for\nreal-world medical federated learning scenarios.",

Existing tools typically aim at managing control flow\ninternally, often at the expense of completeness, while offloading reasoning\nover data flow to SMT solvers. Moreover, reasoning typically happens on source\ncode or intermediate representation level to leverage structural information,\nmaking machine code generation part of the trust base. We are interested in\nchanging the equation in two non-trivial ways: pushing reasoning down to\nmachine code level, and then offloading reasoning entirely into SMT solvers and\nother, possibly more efficient solver technology. In more abstract terms, we\nare asking if bit-precise reasoning technology can be made scalable on\nsoftware, and not just hardware. For this purpose, we developed two tools\ncalled rotor and bitme for model generation and bounded model checking,\nrespectively. We chose RISC-V restricted to integer arithmetic as modeling\ntarget for rotor since RISC-V integer semantics is essentially equivalent to\nestablished SMT semantics over bitvectors and arrays of bitvectors. While\nstate-of-the-art SMT solvers struggle in our experiments, we have evidence that\nthere is potential for improvement. To show the potential, we have slightly\ngeneralized and then implemented in bitme two types of binary decision diagrams\n(BDDs): algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) and context-free-language ordered\nbinary decision diagrams (CFLOBDDs). Bitme uses BDDs to propagate program input\nthrough models, essentially generalizing constant propagation to domain\npropagation. SMT solvers only get involved when model input cannot be\npropagated, significanly speeding up SMT solving. We then study the impact on\nstate explosion of CFLOBDDs, which are potentially more scalable than ADDs.",

    "abstract": "With the growing threat of software vulnerabilities, deep learning (DL)-based\ndetectors have gained popularity for vulnerability detection. However, doubts\nremain regarding their consistency within declared CWE ranges, real-world\neffectiveness, and applicability across scenarios. These issues may lead to\nunreliable detection, high false positives/negatives, and poor adaptability to\nemerging vulnerabilities. A comprehensive analysis is needed to uncover\ncritical factors affecting detection and guide improvements in model design and\ndeployment. In this paper, we present VulTegra, a novel evaluation framework\nthat conducts a multidimensional comparison of scratch-trained and\npre-trained-based DL models for vulnerability detection. VulTegra reveals that\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors still suffer from low consistency, limited\nreal-world capabilities, and scalability challenges. Contrary to common belief,\npre-trained models are not consistently better than scratch-trained models but\nexhibit distinct strengths in specific contexts.Importantly, our study exposes\nthe limitations of relying solely on CWE-based classification and identifies\nkey factors that significantly affect model performance. Experimental results\nshow that adjusting just one such factor consistently improves recall across\nall seven evaluated detectors, with six also achieving better F1 scores. Our\nfindings provide deeper insights into model behavior and emphasize the need to\nconsider both vulnerability types and inherent code features for effective\ndetection.",

To this end, we\npropose a novel EV spatio-temporal large language model (EV-STLLM) for accurate\nprediction. Our proposed framework is divided into two modules.

Fuzzy\ninformation granulation (FIG) for extracting multi-scale information.\nAdditionally, ReliefF is used for feature selection to mitigate redundancy. In\nthe forecasting module, the EV-STLLM is used to directly achieve EV charging\nand occupancy forecasting.

General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such\nas SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of\nthe box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the\nprompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to\nrecognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations\nfor diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has\nbeen trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their\nparts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic\nlandmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another\ngeneral-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection\nand can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO\nis efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in\nsegmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable\npipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical\nlandmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex\noutlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using\nYOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to\naccurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

Here, we propose a\nsymmetry-engineering strategy to unlock altermagnetism in two dimensional (2D)\nantiferromagnetic systems via surface adsorption of atoms or molecules. By\nemploying spin group theory, we systematically demonstrate that selectively\nbreaking symmetry operations, specifically those protecting spin degeneracy in\nmomentum space, enables the emergence of nonrelativistic spin-split electronic\nstates. Meanwhile, preserving rotation or mirror symmetries connecting opposite\nsublattices ensures zero net magnetization. Through a comprehensive\nclassification of all symmetry operations across 80 layer groups, we identify\n63 antiferromagnetic spin point groups (SPGs) describing 2D materials and\nfurther isolate 15 groups that can host altermagnetic characteristics through\nsurface adsorption. Exemplified with monolayer antiferromagnetic VPS_3 and\nMnPSe_3, we show that oxygen adsorption on VPS_3 and NH_3 adsorption on MnPSe_3\nselectively disrupt PT symmetry while retaining the [C2||m] symmetry. This\nengineered symmetry reduction induces pronounced spin splitting in their band\nstructures without spin-orbit coupling, as confirmed by first-principles\ncalculations.

The result also extends over the fields of\npositive characteristics when the target polynomial is suitably modified.

Moreover, Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require\npredefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data\ncontaining many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for\naccurate yet efficient traffic prediction.

The decoder, composed of feed-forward module,\ncomplements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can\nperform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated significant promise in various\nphysical design (PD) tasks. However, model generalizability remains limited by\nthe availability of high-quality, large-scale training datasets. Creating such\ndatasets is often computationally expensive and constrained by IP. While very\nfew public datasets are available, they are typically static, slow to generate,\nand require frequent updates. To address these limitations, we present DALI-PD,\na scalable framework for generating synthetic layout heatmaps to accelerate ML\nin PD research. DALI-PD uses a diffusion model to generate diverse layout\nheatmaps via fast inference in seconds. The heatmaps include power, IR drop,\ncongestion, macro placement, and cell density maps. Using DALI-PD, we created a\ndataset comprising over 20,000 layout configurations with varying macro counts\nand placements. These heatmaps closely resemble real layouts and improve ML\naccuracy on downstream ML tasks such as IR drop or congestion prediction.",

The trained\nnetwork is subsequently embedded into the first-stage UC problem as a\nmixed-integer linear program (MILP), allowing for explicit enforcement of\noperational constraints while preserving the key uncertainty characteristics. A\nscenario-embedding network is employed to enable dimensionality reduction and\nfeature aggregation across arbitrary scenario sets, serving as a data-driven\nscenario reduction mechanism. Numerical experiments on IEEE 5-bus, 30-bus, and\n118-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed neural two-stage stochastic\noptimization method achieves solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%,\nwhile enabling orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to conventional MILP\nsolvers and decomposition-based methods.

Among\nvarious TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving\nhistorical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering\nefficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability\nchallenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,\ncausing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation\nperformance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible\ndecision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)\nmethod that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from\ntwo perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample\nselection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware\nEntropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight\nentropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low\nentropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method\nleverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and\nfacilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven\nDistribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as\nmultivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for\nmore accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, particularly under real-world distribution shifts. Code:\nhttps://github.com/Evelyn1ywliang/ReTA.",

Operational parameters of BSs, which inherently contain beam\ninformation, offer an opportunity for data-driven low-altitude coverage\nprediction. However, collecting extensive low-altitude road test data is\ncost-prohibitive, often yielding only sparse samples per BS. This scarcity\nresults in two primary challenges: imbalanced feature sampling due to limited\nvariability in high-dimensional operational parameters against the backdrop of\nsubstantial changes in low-dimensional sampling locations, and diminished\ngeneralizability stemming from insufficient data samples.

    "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning faces fundamental challenges that\nconventional approaches have failed to overcome: exponentially growing joint\naction spaces, non-stationary environments where simultaneous learning creates\nmoving targets, and partial observability that constrains coordination. Current\nmethods remain reactive, employing stimulus-response mechanisms that fail when\nfacing novel scenarios. We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from\nreactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based\nreinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as\nisolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of\nsynthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions\nbased on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than\nresponding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model\nenvironment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated\naction sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term\ndynamics. This approach leverages pattern recognition and generation\ncapabilities of generative AI to enable proactive decision-making, seamless\ncoordination through enhanced communication, and dynamic adaptation to evolving\nscenarios. We envision this paradigm shift will unlock unprecedented\npossibilities for distributed intelligence, moving beyond individual\noptimization toward emergent collective behaviors representing genuine\ncollaborative intelligence.

    "abstract": "We introduce an algorithm for identifying interpretable subgroups with\nelevated treatment effects, given an estimate of individual or conditional\naverage treatment effects (CATE). Subgroups are characterized by ``rule sets''\n-- easy-to-understand statements of the form (Condition A AND Condition B) OR\n(Condition C) -- which can capture high-order interactions while retaining\ninterpretability. Our method complements existing approaches for estimating the\nCATE, which often produce high dimensional and uninterpretable results, by\nsummarizing and extracting critical information from fitted models to aid\ndecision making, policy implementation, and scientific understanding. We\npropose an objective function that trades-off subgroup size and effect size,\nand varying the hyperparameter that controls this trade-off results in a\n``frontier'' of Pareto optimal rule sets, none of which dominates the others\nacross all criteria. Valid inference is achievable through sample splitting. We\ndemonstrate the utility and limitations of our method using simulated and\nempirical examples.",

In ferromagnets, large MOKE signals arise from the combination\nof magnetization and SOC, while in certain coplanar antiferromagnets,\nSOC-induced Berry curvature enables MOKE despite zero net magnetization.\nTheoretically, large MOKE can also arise in a broader class of magnetic\nmaterials with compensated spins, without relying on SOC - for example, in\nsystems exhibiting real-space scalar spin chirality. The experimental\nverification has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate such a SOC- and\nmagnetization-free MOKE in the noncoplanar antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2. Using a\nSagnac interferometer microscope, we image domains of scalar spin chirality and\ntheir reversal.

This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language\nmodels (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial\nframe-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark\nspecifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with\nvideos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video\nunderstanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over\n4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including\nTrajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions\nare carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video\nand reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with\nvideo. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or\nrelying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy,\nbut current LVLMs face significant challenges.

    "abstract": "Playtesting is the process in which people play a video game for testing. It\nis critical for the quality assurance of gaming software. Manual playtesting is\ntime-consuming and expensive. However, automating this process is challenging,\nas playtesting typically requires domain knowledge and problem-solving skills\nthat most conventional testing tools lack. Recent advancements in artificial\nintelligence (AI) have opened up new possibilities for applying Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to playtesting. However, significant challenges remain: current\nLLMs cannot visually perceive game environments, and most existing research\nfocuses on text-based games or games with robust APIs. Many non-text games lack\nAPIs to provide textual descriptions of game states, making it almost\nimpossible to naively apply LLMs for playtesting. This paper introduces Lap,\nour novel approach to LLM-based Automatic Playtesting, which uses ChatGPT to\ntest match-3 games, a category of games where players match three or more\nidentical tiles in a row or column to earn points. Lap encompasses three key\nphases: processing of game environments, prompting-based action generation, and\naction execution. Given a match-3 game, Lap takes a snapshot of the game board\nand converts it to a numeric matrix. It then prompts the ChatGPT-O1-mini API to\nsuggest moves based on that matrix and tentatively applies the suggested moves\nto earn points and trigger changes in the game board. It repeats the\nabove-mentioned three steps iteratively until timeout. For evaluation, we\nconducted a case study using Lap on an open-source match-3 game, CasseBonbons,\nand empirically compared it with three existing tools. Our results are\npromising: Lap outperformed existing tools by achieving higher code coverage\nand triggering more program crashes. This research sheds light on the future of\nautomatic testing and LLM applications.",

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has intensified security\nchallenges, notably from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks launched\nby compromised, resource-constrained devices. Traditional defenses are often\nill-suited for the IoT paradigm, creating a need for lightweight,\nhigh-performance, edge-based solutions. This paper presents the design,\nimplementation, and evaluation of an IoT security framework that leverages the\nextended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) and the eXpress Data Path (XDP) for\nin-kernel mitigation of DDoS attacks. The system uses a rate-based detection\nalgorithm to identify and block malicious traffic at the earliest stage of the\nnetwork stack. The framework is evaluated using both Docker-based simulations\nand real-world deployment on a Raspberry Pi 4, showing over 97% mitigation\neffectiveness under a 100 Mbps flood. Legitimate traffic remains unaffected,\nand system stability is preserved even under attack. These results confirm that\neBPF/XDP provides a viable and highly efficient solution for hardening IoT edge\ndevices against volumetric network attacks.",

We present a\nmodel of a perfect superconducting diode based on a superconducting quantum\ninterference device made with multiple superconducting nanowires (MW-SQUID).\nThe superconducting condensate in the nanowires is assumed to obey a linear\ncurrent-phase relationship (CPR).

In regression analysis, if an explanatory variable is\nleft-censored due to concentrations below the DL, one may limit analyses to\nobserved data. In many studies, additional, or surrogate, variables are\navailable to model, and incorporating such auxiliary modeling information into\nthe regression model can improve statistical power. Although methods have been\ndeveloped along this line, almost all are limited to parametric models for both\nthe regression and left-censored explanatory variable. While some recent work\nhas considered semiparametric regression for the censored DL-effected\nexplanatory variable, the regression of primary interest is still left\nparametric, which not only makes it prone to biased estimates, but also suffers\nfrom high computational cost and inefficiency due to maximizing an extremely\ncomplex likelihood function and bootstrap inference. In this paper, we propose\na new approach by considering semiparametric generalized linear models (SPGLM)\nfor the primary regression and parametric or semiparametric models for\nDL-effected explanatory variable. The semiparametric and semiparametric\ncombination provides the most robust inference, while the semiparametric and\nparametric case enables more efficient inference. The proposed approach is also\nmuch easier to implement and allows for leveraging sample splitting and cross\nfitting (SSCF) to improve computational efficiency in variance estimation.

Yet, only few tackle the difficult task of directly generating fully\natomistic structures jointly with the underlying amino acid sequence. This is\nchallenging, for instance, because the model must reason over side chains that\nchange in length during generation. We introduce La-Proteina for atomistic\nprotein design based on a novel partially latent protein representation: coarse\nbackbone structure is modeled explicitly, while sequence and atomistic details\nare captured via per-residue latent variables of fixed dimensionality, thereby\neffectively side-stepping challenges of explicit side-chain representations.\nFlow matching in this partially latent space then models the joint distribution\nover sequences and full-atom structures. La-Proteina achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on multiple generation benchmarks, including all-atom\nco-designability, diversity, and structural validity, as confirmed through\ndetailed structural analyses and evaluations. Notably, La-Proteina also\nsurpasses previous models in atomistic motif scaffolding performance, unlocking\ncritical atomistic structure-conditioned protein design tasks. Moreover,\nLa-Proteina is able to generate co-designable proteins of up to 800 residues, a\nregime where most baselines collapse and fail to produce valid samples,\ndemonstrating La-Proteina's scalability and robustness.",

However, this view is challenged by several recent experiments in\nnoncollinear antiferromagnets, which urge a thorough theoretical investigation\nat the fundamental level. We find that the magnon spin in antiferromagnets is\ndescribed by a matrix, so even when the diagonal terms -- spins carried by\npopulation -- vanish, the off-diagonal correlations transmit magnon spins. Our\nquantum theory shows that a net spin-flip of electrons in adjacent conductors\ncreates quantum coherence between magnon states, which transports magnon spins\nin canted antiferromagnets, even without a definite phase difference between\nmagnon modes in the incoherent process. It reveals that the pumped magnon\ncorrelation is not conserved due to an intrinsic spin torque, which causes\ndephasing and strong spatial spin oscillations during transport; both are\nenhanced by magnetic fields. Spin transfer to proximity conductors can cause\nextrinsic dephasing, which suppresses spin oscillations and thereby gates spin\ntransport.",

Such a trend\ncontrasts sharply with direct imaging findings, where cold (5-100 AU) brown\ndwarfs and giant planets display distinct eccentricity distributions. Our\nresults suggest that transiting long-period brown dwarfs and giant planets\nprobably 1) form in different routes at exterior orbits but undergo analogous\ndynamical evolution processes and migrate inwards; or 2) both contain two\nsub-groups, one with widely spread eccentricities while the other has circular\norbits, that jointly sculpt the eccentricity distributions.

To further release the potential of HNOMA, this paper\nproposes a novel design of H-NOMA which jointly incorporates hybrid successive\ninterference cancellation (HSIC) and power adaptation (PA) in the NOMA\ntransmission phase. To reveal the potential of the proposed HSIC-PA aided\nH-NOMA scheme, closed-form expression for the probability of the event that\nH-NOMA can achieve a higher data rate than pure OMA by consuming less energy is\nrigorously derived.

This represents a significant\nimprovement over conventional H-NOMA schemes, which require specific\nrestrictive conditions to achieve probability 1 at high SNRs as shown in\nexisting work. The above observation indicates that with less energy\nconsumption, the proposed HSIC-PA aided H-NOMA can achieve a higher data rate\nthan pure OMA with probability 1 at high SNRs, and hence a higher energy\nefficiency.

Motivated by this graded perception, we introduce a\nnew three-dimensional SPP model in which metric and topological alignments act\nsimultaneously and are weighted by a single tunable mixing parameter called the\ninteraction parameter. Large-scale simulations spanning a wide ranges of\ninteraction parameters and densities revealed rich dynamics. Even when the\nglobal order parameter is low, cluster-level analysis with HDBSCAN shows that\nparticles self-organize into several spatially distinct but internally\nwell-aligned sub-flocks, exposing a hidden layer of order. Most importantly, an\nintermediate balance in which metric and topological cues contribute almost\nequally maximizes the global order parameter and markedly improves robustness\nto density variations. Numerical experiments supported by linear stability\nanalysis demonstrate that activating metric and topological interactions in\nconcert bridges the traditional modeling dichotomy and furnishes a more\nadaptive and resilient framework for collective motion.

This rule guides branching decisions based exclusively\non the information regarding local gains in the linear programming (LP) bounds.\nWe identify and correct two key shortcomings in FSB. First, the LP gains may be\noverestimations of the improvement in global dual bounds whenever pruning is\npossible. We propose a modification to address this issue, that incorporates\nprimal bounds and readjusts the relative importance of the larger and smaller\nLP gains. Second, FSB decisions may be myopic as they consider only local LP\ngains and cannot foresee the impact of branching decisions on feasibility or\nintegrality beyond immediate children. To address this weakness, we present an\napproach that detects global asymmetry trends in infeasibility and integrality\ndue to 0 and 1 assignments and incorporates them into the FSB score function.\nWe further extend this approach to achieve more balanced trees even when the\nbranch-and-bound tree prunes primarily by bounds.\n  Using randomly generated problem instances with known structures, we derive\ninsights and fine-tune our modified scores.

    "abstract": "The digitization of democratic processes promises greater accessibility but\npresents challenges in terms of security, privacy, and verifiability. Existing\nelectronic voting systems often rely on centralized architectures, creating\nsingle points of failure and forcing too much trust in authorities, which\ncontradicts democratic principles. This research addresses the challenge of\ncreating a secure, private e-voting system with minimized trust dependencies\ndesigned for the most versatile personal device: the smartphone. We introduce\nSmartphoneDemocracy, a novel e-voting protocol that combines three key\ntechnologies: the emerging European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet for\nSybil-resistant identity verification, Zero-Knowledge Proofs for\nprivacy-preserving validation, and a peer-to-peer blockchain (TrustChain) for a\nresilient, serverless public bulletin board. Our protocol enables voters to\nregister and cast ballots anonymously and verifiably directly from their\nsmartphones. We provide a detailed protocol design, a security analysis against\na defined threat model, and a performance evaluation demonstrating that the\ncomputational and network overhead is feasible for medium- to large-scale\nelections. By developing and prototyping this system, we demonstrate a viable\npath to empower citizens with a trustworthy, accessible, and user-controlled\ndigital voting experience.",

    "abstract": "Finding a target in a complex environment is a fundamental challenge in\nnature, from chemical reactions to sperm reaching an egg. An effective strategy\nto reduce the time needed to reach a target is to deploy many searchers,\nincreasing the likelihood that at least one will succeed by using the\nstatistics of rare events. When the underlying stochastic process involves\nbroadly distributed step sizes, rare long jumps dominate the dynamics, making\nthe use of multiple searchers particularly powerful. We investigate the\nstatistics of extreme events for the mean first passage time in a system of $N$\nindependent walkers moving with jumps distributed according to a power law,\nwhere target-reaching is governed by single, large fluctuations. We show that\nthe mean first passage time of the fastest walker scales as $\\langle \\tau_N\n\\rangle \\sim 1/N$, representing a dramatic speed-up compared to classical\nBrownian search strategies. From this, we derive a scaling law relating the\nnumber of walkers required to reach a target within a given time to the size\n$X$ of the search region. As an application, we model biological fertilization,\npredicting how the optimal number of spermatozoa scales with uterus size across\nspecies. Our predictions match empirical data, suggesting that evolution may\nhave exploited rare-event dynamics and broadly distributed motion to optimize\nreproductive success. This theory applies broadly to any population of\nsearchers operating within a region of size $X$, providing a universal\nframework for efficient search in disordered or high-dimensional environments.",

We find that existing\nFourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series\nlength issues.

A statistical shuffle test validation further strengthens\nrobustness by filtering false positives and improving causal inference\nreliability. Extensive evaluations on financial and marketing datasets\ndemonstrate that DyCAST-Net consistently outperforms existing models such as\nTCDF, GCFormer, and CausalFormer. The model provides a more precise estimation\nof causal delays and significantly reduces false discoveries, particularly in\nnoisy environments. Moreover, attention heatmaps offer interpretable insights,\nuncovering hidden causal patterns such as the mediated effects of advertising\non consumer behavior and the influence of macroeconomic indicators on financial\nmarkets. Case studies illustrate DyCAST-Net's ability to detect latent\nmediators and lagged causal factors, making it particularly effective in\nhigh-dimensional, dynamic settings. The model's architecture enhanced by\nRMSNorm stabilization and causal masking ensures scalability and adaptability\nacross diverse application domains",

    "abstract": "The material point method (MPM), a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian particle\nmethod, is increasingly used to simulate large-deformation and\nhistory-dependent behavior of geomaterials. While explicit time integration\ndominates current MPM implementations due to its algorithmic simplicity, such\nschemes are unsuitable for quasi-static and long-term processes typical in\ngeomechanics. Implicit MPM formulations are free of these limitations but\nremain less adopted, largely due to the difficulty of computing the Jacobian\nmatrix required for Newton-type solvers, especially when consistent tangent\noperators should be derived for complex constitutive models. In this paper, we\nintroduce GeoWarp -- an implicit MPM framework for geomechanics built on NVIDIA\nWarp -- that exploits GPU parallelism and reverse-mode automatic\ndifferentiation to compute Jacobians without manual derivation. To enhance\nefficiency, we develop a sparse Jacobian construction algorithm that leverages\nthe localized particle-grid interactions intrinsic to MPM. The framework is\nverified through forward and inverse examples in large-deformation\nelastoplasticity and coupled poromechanics. Results demonstrate that GeoWarp\nprovides a robust, scalable, and extensible platform for differentiable\nimplicit MPM simulation in computational geomechanics.",

Normalized sensitivities of core and edge\ntemperatures and densities are computed with respect to transport\ndiffusivities, electron cyclotron radiation (ECR) parameters, impurity\nfractions, and ion orbit loss (IOL) timescales.
