    "abstract": "Mental-illness stigma is a persistent social problem, hampering both\ntreatment-seeking and recovery. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to\nunderstand it more clearly, but analyzing the relevant data is highly\nlabor-intensive. Therefore, we designed a chatbot to engage participants in\nconversations; coded those conversations qualitatively with AI assistance; and,\nbased on those coding results, built causal knowledge graphs to decode stigma.\nThe results we obtained from 1,002 participants demonstrate that conversation\nwith our chatbot can elicit rich information about people's attitudes toward\ndepression, while our AI-assisted coding was strongly consistent with\nhuman-expert coding. Our novel approach combining large language models (LLMs)\nand causal knowledge graphs uncovered patterns in individual responses and\nillustrated the interrelationships of psychological constructs in the dataset\nas a whole. The paper also discusses these findings' implications for HCI\nresearchers in developing digital interventions, decomposing human\npsychological constructs, and fostering inclusive attitudes.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement in building large language models (LLMs) has\nintensified competition among big-tech companies and AI startups. In this\nregard, model evaluations are critical for product and investment-related\ndecision-making. While open evaluation sets like MMLU initially drove progress,\nconcerns around data contamination and data bias have constantly questioned\ntheir reliability. As a result, it has led to the rise of private data curators\nwho have begun conducting hidden evaluations with high-quality self-curated\ntest prompts and their own expert annotators. In this paper, we argue that\ndespite potential advantages in addressing contamination issues, private\nevaluations introduce inadvertent financial and evaluation risks. In\nparticular, the key concerns include the potential conflict of interest arising\nfrom private data curators' business relationships with their clients (leading\nLLM firms). In addition, we highlight that the subjective preferences of\nprivate expert annotators will lead to inherent evaluation bias towards the\nmodels trained with the private curators' data. Overall, this paper lays the\nfoundation for studying the risks of private evaluations that can lead to\nwide-ranging community discussions and policy changes.",

Each WCMDP consists\nof $N$ arms (or subproblems), which have distinct model parameters in the fully\nheterogeneous setting, leading to the curse of dimensionality when $N$ is\nlarge. We show that, under mild assumptions, an efficiently computable policy\nachieves an $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap in the long-run average reward per\narm for fully heterogeneous WCMDPs as $N$ becomes large. This is the first\nasymptotic optimality result for fully heterogeneous average-reward WCMDPs.

Based on these\nmeasurements, we confirm all eleven sources as giants, with linear sizes\nranging from 0.7 to 2.9 Mpc, including ten GRGs and one giant radio quasar\n(GRQ). One of the GRGs shows evidence of a potential AGN jet-driven ionized\noutflow, extending up to $\\sim$12 kpc, which, if confirmed, would represent a\nrarely observed feature. Two of the confirmed GRGs exceed 2 Mpc in size, which\nare relatively rare examples of GRG. The redshifts of the host galaxies span\n0.09323 $\\leq$ z $\\leq$ 0.41134. Using the obtained spectroscopic data, we\ncharacterised their AGN states based on the optical emission line properties.\nTo complement these observations, archival radio and optical survey data were\nutilised to characterise their large-scale radio morphology and estimate\nprojected linear sizes, arm-length ratios, flux densities, luminosities, and\ncore dominance factors.

However, fine-tuning\ncontinuous flow-based generative models to align with arbitrary user-defined\nreward functions remains challenging, particularly due to issues such as policy\ncollapse from overoptimization and the prohibitively high computational cost of\nlikelihoods in continuous-time flows. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-use\nand theoretically sound RL fine-tuning method, which we term Online\nReward-Weighted Conditional Flow Matching with Wasserstein-2 Regularization\n(ORW-CFM-W2). Our method integrates RL into the flow matching framework to\nfine-tune generative models with arbitrary reward functions, without relying on\ngradients of rewards or filtered datasets. By introducing an online\nreward-weighting mechanism, our approach guides the model to prioritize\nhigh-reward regions in the data manifold. To prevent policy collapse and\nmaintain diversity, we incorporate Wasserstein-2 (W2) distance regularization\ninto our method and derive a tractable upper bound for it in flow matching,\neffectively balancing exploration and exploitation of policy optimization. We\nprovide theoretical analyses to demonstrate the convergence properties and\ninduced data distributions of our method, establishing connections with\ntraditional RL algorithms featuring Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization and\noffering a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms and\nlearning behavior of our approach. Extensive experiments on tasks including\ntarget image generation, image compression, and text-image alignment\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where our method achieves optimal\npolicy convergence while allowing controllable trade-offs between reward\nmaximization and diversity preservation.",

However, most prior\nworks are limited as they either rely on training with large amounts of human\ndemonstrations or lack the ability to generate natural and useful communication\nstrategies. In this work, we train language models to have productive\ndiscussions about their environment in natural language without any human\ndemonstrations. We decompose the communication problem into listening and\nspeaking. Our key idea is to leverage the agent's goal to predict useful\ninformation about the world as a dense reward signal that guides communication.\nSpecifically, we improve a model's listening skills by training them to predict\ninformation about the environment based on discussions, and we simultaneously\nimprove a model's speaking skills with multi-agent reinforcement learning by\nrewarding messages based on their influence on other agents. To investigate the\nrole and necessity of communication in complex social settings, we study an\nembodied social deduction game based on Among Us, where the key question to\nanswer is the identity of an adversarial imposter.

The NC were estimated both globally for all channels\n(AllCh) and locally (for each single channel) in different Functional States\n(FSs). The values of $q$ was compared among FSs and single channels, as well\nthey were correlated with the power of $\\theta$ (4-8Hz), $\\beta_1$ (15-25Hz)\nand others EEG bands, in each FS. The value of $q$ across all FSs was higher\nfor AllCh than for the single channels FSs. Consistently with previous studies,\nwe found a negative correlation between NC and age. The FSs did not influence\nthe $q$ of the EEG in AllCh, although locally the FS modulated $q$ in a\nconsistent manner (e.g., reducing $q$ in posterior sites with eyes closed). The\n$q$ was correlated positively with the power of the $\\theta$ and negatively\nwith that of the $\\beta_1$ band in general.

    "abstract": "Although many popular reinforcement learning algorithms are underpinned by\n$f$-divergence regularization, their sample complexity with respect to the\n\\emph{regularized objective} still lacks a tight characterization. In this\npaper, we analyze $f$-divergence-regularized offline policy learning. For\nreverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, arguably the most commonly used one,\nwe give the first $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-1})$ sample complexity under\nsingle-policy concentrability for contextual bandits, surpassing existing\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-1})$ bound under all-policy concentrability and\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ bound under single-policy concentrability. Our\nanalysis for general function approximation leverages the principle of\npessimism in the face of uncertainty to refine a mean-value-type argument to\nits extreme. This in turn leads to a novel moment-based technique, effectively\nbypassing the need for uniform control over the discrepancy between any two\nfunctions in the function class. We further propose a lower bound,\ndemonstrating that a multiplicative dependency on single-policy concentrability\nis necessary to maximally exploit the strong convexity of reverse KL. In\naddition, for $f$-divergences with strongly convex $f$, to which reverse KL\n\\emph{does not} belong, we show that the sharp sample complexity\n$\\tilde{\\Theta}(\\epsilon^{-1})$ is achievable even without single-policy\nconcentrability. In this case, the algorithm design can get rid of pessimistic\nestimators. We further extend our analysis to dueling bandits, and we believe\nthese results take a significant step toward a comprehensive understanding of\n$f$-divergence-regularized policy learning.",

Computing or estimating $ex_F(G)$ for various pairs $F,G$ is\none of the central problems in extremal combinatorics. It is thus natural to\nask how hard is it to compute this function. Motivated by an old problem of\nYannakakis from the 80's, Alon, Shapira and Sudakov [ASS'09] proved that for\nevery non-bipartite graph $F$, computing $ex_F(G)$ is NP-hard. Addressing a\nconjecture of Ailon and Alon (2007), we prove a hypergraph analogue of this\ntheorem, showing that for every $k \\geq 3$ and every non-$k$-partite $k$-graph\n$F$, computing $ex_F(G)$ is NP-hard. Furthermore, we conjecture that our\nhardness result can be extended to all $k$-graphs $F$ other than a matching of\nfixed size. If true, this would give a precise characterization of the\n$k$-graphs $F$ for which computing $ex_F(G)$ is NP-hard, since we also prove\nthat when $F$ is a matching of fixed size, $ex_F(G)$ is computable in\npolynomial time. This last result can be considered an algorithmic version of\nthe celebrated Erd\\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem.\n  The proof of [ASS'09] relied on a variety of tools from extremal graph\ntheory, one of them being Tur\\'an's theorem. One of the main challenges we have\nto overcome in order to prove our hypergraph extension is the lack of a\nTur\\'an-type theorem for $k$-graphs.

While reasoning is a\ntopic of great interest in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is\nundefined and largely unexplored in the context of TSFMs. In this work,\ninspired by language modeling literature, we formally define compositional\nreasoning in forecasting and distinguish it from in-distribution\ngeneralization. We evaluate the reasoning and generalization capabilities of 16\npopular deep learning forecasting models on multiple synthetic and real-world\ndatasets. Additionally, through controlled studies, we systematically examine\nwhich design choices in 7 popular open-source TSFMs contribute to improved\nreasoning capabilities. Our study yields key insights into the impact of TSFM\narchitecture design on compositional reasoning and generalization. We find that\npatch-based Transformers have the best reasoning performance, closely followed\nby residualized MLP-based architectures, which are 97\\% less computationally\ncomplex in terms of FLOPs and 86\\% smaller in terms of the number of trainable\nparameters. Interestingly, in some zero-shot out-of-distribution scenarios,\nthese models can outperform moving average and exponential smoothing\nstatistical baselines trained on in-distribution data. Only a few design\nchoices, such as the tokenization method, had a significant (negative) impact\non Transformer model performance.",

One prominent hypothesis\nis that they enable the transfer and integration of spatial information across\nneural populations. However, few computational models have explored how\ntraveling waves might be harnessed to perform such integrative processing.\nDrawing inspiration from the famous \"Can one hear the shape of a drum?\" problem\n-- which highlights how normal modes of wave dynamics encode geometric\ninformation -- we investigate whether similar principles can be leveraged in\nartificial neural networks. Specifically, we introduce convolutional recurrent\nneural networks that learn to produce traveling waves in their hidden states in\nresponse to visual stimuli, enabling spatial integration. By then treating\nthese wave-like activation sequences as visual representations themselves, we\nobtain a powerful representational space that outperforms local feed-forward\nnetworks on tasks requiring global spatial context. In particular, we observe\nthat traveling waves effectively expand the receptive field of locally\nconnected neurons, supporting long-range encoding and communication of\ninformation. We demonstrate that models equipped with this mechanism solve\nvisual semantic segmentation tasks demanding global integration, significantly\noutperforming local feed-forward models and rivaling non-local U-Net models\nwith fewer parameters. As a first step toward traveling-wave-based\ncommunication and visual representation in artificial networks, our findings\nsuggest wave-dynamics may provide efficiency and training stability benefits,\nwhile simultaneously offering a new framework for connecting models to\nbiological recordings of neural activity.",

We further propose three different strategies for generating\ndistinct captions: captioning, perturbation, and hybrid methods. Our\nexperiments show that DCPO significantly improves image quality and relevance\nto prompts, outperforming Stable Diffusion (SD) 2.1, SFT_Chosen, Diffusion-DPO,\nand MaPO across multiple metrics, including Pickscore, HPSv2.1, GenEval,\nCLIPscore, and ImageReward, fine-tuned on SD 2.1 as the backbone.",

    "abstract": "Many machine learning methods look for low-dimensional representations of the\ndata. The underlying subspace can be estimated by first choosing a dimension\n$q$ and then optimizing a certain objective function over the space of\n$q$-dimensional subspaces (the Grassmannian). Trying different $q$ yields in\ngeneral non-nested subspaces, which raises an important issue of consistency\nbetween the data representations. In this paper, we propose a simple trick to\nenforce nestedness in subspace learning methods. It consists in lifting\nGrassmannian optimization problems to flag manifolds (the space of nested\nsubspaces of increasing dimension) via nested projectors. We apply the flag\ntrick to several classical machine learning methods and show that it\nsuccessfully addresses the nestedness issue.",

We further introduce a novel approach for inter-view\nrepresentation alignment by explicitly enforcing coherence in embedding\ndistances, ensuring consistent feature representations across views.

In this thesis, we address these limitations by presenting\nthree different works. Firstly, we consider the problem of high variance in the\nimportance-sampling-based OPE estimators. We introduce the Marginal Ratio (MR)\nestimator, a novel OPE method that reduces variance by focusing on the marginal\ndistribution of outcomes rather than direct policy shifts, improving robustness\nin contextual bandits. Next, we propose Conformal Off-Policy Prediction (COPP),\na principled approach for uncertainty quantification in OPE that provides\nfinite-sample predictive intervals, ensuring robust decision-making in\nrisk-sensitive applications. Finally, we address causal unidentifiability in\noff-policy decision-making by developing novel bounds for sequential decision\nsettings, which remain valid under arbitrary unmeasured confounding. We apply\nthese bounds to assess the reliability of digital twin models, introducing a\nfalsification framework to identify scenarios where model predictions diverge\nfrom real-world behaviour. Our contributions provide new insights into robust\ndecision-making under uncertainty and establish principled methods for\nevaluating policies in both static and dynamic settings.",

By integrating large\nlanguage models, we provide near real-time granular insights into the topics,\ntone, political lean, and facts of news articles aggregated to the publisher\nlevel. We assessed the tool's impact by interviewing 13 experts from\njournalism, communications, and political science, revealing key insights into\nusability and functionality, practical applications, and AI's role in powering\nmedia bias tools. We explored this in more depth with a follow-up survey of 150\nnews consumers.

Recently, Hussak and\nTrehan [PODC'19/DC'23] proposed a stateless broadcasting protocol (Amnesiac\nFlooding), which was surprisingly proven to terminate in asymptotically optimal\ntime (linear in the diameter of the network). However, it remains unclear: (i)\nAre there other stateless terminating broadcast algorithms with the desirable\nproperties of Amnesiac Flooding, (ii) How robust is Amnesiac Flooding with\nrespect to \\emph{faults}?\n  In this paper we make progress on both of these fronts. Under a reasonable\nrestriction (obliviousness to message content) additional to the fault-free\nsynchronous model, we prove that Amnesiac Flooding is the \\emph{only} strictly\nstateless deterministic protocol that can achieve terminating broadcast. We\nidentify four natural properties of a terminating broadcast protocol that\nAmnesiac Flooding uniquely satisfies. In contrast, we prove that even minor\nrelaxations of \\textit{any} of these four criteria allow the construction of\nother terminating broadcast protocols.\n  On the other hand, we prove that Amnesiac Flooding can become non-terminating\nor non-broadcasting, even if we allow just one node to drop a single message on\na single edge in a single round. As a tool for proving this, we focus on the\nset of all \\textit{configurations} of transmissions between nodes in the\nnetwork, and obtain a \\textit{dichotomy} characterizing the configurations,\nstarting from which, Amnesiac Flooding terminates.\n  Additionally, we characterise the structure of sets of Byzantine agents\ncapable of forcing non-termination or non-broadcast of the protocol on\narbitrary networks.",

Furthermore, we demonstrate the real-world impact of our\nmethodology by showing that it performs competitively with the current\nstate-of-the-art in predicting malaria prevalence estimates in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica.",

These\nissues are because a cascade-based method uses a combination of methods such as\nspeech recognition, speech-to-text translation, and finally, text-to-speech\ntranslation. Translatotron, a sequence-to-sequence direct speech-to-speech\ntranslation model was designed by Google to address the issues of compound\nerrors associated with cascade model. Today there are 3 versions of the\nTranslatotron model: Translatotron 1, Translatotron 2, and Translatotron3. The\nfirst version was designed as a proof of concept to show that a direct\nspeech-to-speech translation was possible, it was found to be less effective\nthan the cascade model but was producing promising results. Translatotron2 was\nan improved version of Translatotron 1 with results similar to the cascade\nmodel. Translatotron 3 the latest version of the model is better than the\ncascade model at some points. In this paper, a complete review of\nspeech-to-speech translation will be presented, with a particular focus on all\nthe versions of Translatotron models.

While recent advances in generative\nartificial intelligence have driven progress in generic image and video\nsynthesis, the domain of controllable VFX generation remains relatively\nunderexplored. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm for animated VFX\ngeneration as image animation, where dynamic effects are generated from\nuser-friendly textual descriptions and static reference images. Our work makes\ntwo primary contributions: (i) Open-VFX, the first high-quality VFX video\ndataset spanning 15 diverse effect categories, annotated with textual\ndescriptions, instance segmentation masks for spatial conditioning, and\nstart-end timestamps for temporal control. (ii) VFX Creator, a simple yet\neffective controllable VFX generation framework based on a Video Diffusion\nTransformer. The model incorporates a spatial and temporal controllable LoRA\nadapter, requiring minimal training videos. Specifically, a plug-and-play mask\ncontrol module enables instance-level spatial manipulation, while tokenized\nstart-end motion timestamps embedded in the diffusion process, alongside the\ntext encoder, allow precise temporal control over effect timing and pace.\nExtensive experiments on the Open-VFX test set demonstrate the superiority of\nthe proposed system in generating realistic and dynamic effects, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance and generalization ability in both spatial and\ntemporal controllability. Furthermore, we introduce a specialized metric to\nevaluate the precision of temporal control.

Comprehending droplet aerobreakup or air-assisted\nsecondary atomization is challenging, especially in high-speed flow scenarios.\nThis entails multi-scale interface deformations with intricate wave dynamics\nthat conform to a non-linear cascade. In the present study, we look into\nshockwave-induced breakups and associated intermediate processes happening at\nsmaller spatiotemporal scales across the disintegrating droplet interface at\ndifferent Weber numbers ($We \\sim 10^3$). We observe the undulations to follow\nbreakup patterns that resemble a scaled-down version of a secondary atomization\nevent. These sub-secondary breakup processes end with corrugated ligaments that\ngenerate the final daughter droplets. The size distribution of these droplets\nis estimated using a Depth from Defocus (DFD) technique. These illustrate the\ntransient nature of aerobreakup, where the normalized statistics in subsequent\ntime periods and different $We$ are observed to follow a universal\ndistribution. This conforms to a gamma distribution where the associated fit\nparameters agree well with the coefficients determined from ligament shape\nfactors, corresponding to the limit associated with most extreme corrugations.\nScaling laws based on $We$ are deduced for the averaged statistics using a high\nenergy chaotic breakup mechanism. These observations reinforce the idea of a\nself-similar mechanism for catastrophic aerobreakup of a droplet.",

Our work covers model-based\nlearning and model-free learning in the hybrid regime, with a newly proposed\nextension of the bilinear classes (Du et al., 2021) to the adversarial-reward\ncase.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the slow patterns of multilayer dislocation dynamics\nmodeled by a multiscale parabolic equation in the half-plane coupled with a\ndynamic boundary condition on the interface. We focus on the influence of bulk\ndynamics with various relaxation time scales, on the slow motion pattern on the\ninterface governed by an ODE system. Starting from a superposition of N\nstationary transition layers, at a specific time scale for the interface\ndynamics, we prove that the dynamic solution approaches the superposition of N\nexplicit transition profiles whose centers solve the ODE system with a\nrepulsive force. Notably, this ODE system is identical to the one obtained in\nthe slow motion patterns of the one-dimensional fractional Allen-Cahn equation,\nwhere the elastic bulk is assumed to be static. Due to the fully coupled bulk\nand interface dynamics, new corrector functions with delicate estimates are\nconstructed to stabilize the bulk dynamics and characterize the limiting\nbehavior of the dynamic solution throughout the entire half-plane.",

This study confronts this challenge by introducing\na detailed model that incorporates noise factors arising from both ADCs and\nRRAM devices. The experimental data is derived from a 40nm foundry RRAM\ntest-chip, wherein different reference voltage configurations are applied, each\ntailored to its respective module. The mean and standard deviation values of\nHRS and LRS cells are derived through a randomized vector, forming the\nfoundation for noise simulation within our analytical framework. Additionally,\nthe study examines the read-disturb effects, shedding light on the potential\nfor accuracy deterioration in neural networks due to extended exposure to\nhigh-voltage stress. This phenomenon is mitigated through the proposed\nlow-voltage read mode. Leveraging our derived comprehensive fault model from\nthe RRAM test-chip, we evaluate CIM noise impact on both supervised learning\n(time-independent) and reinforcement learning (time-dependent) tasks, and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of reference tuning to mitigate noise impacts.",

In contrast to\nprevious studies, we demonstrate that inference-time activation interventions\ncan bypass safety alignments and effectively steer model generations towards\nharmful AI coordination. Our method applies fine-grained interventions at\nspecific attention heads, which we identify by probing each head in a simple\nbinary choice task. We then show that interventions on these heads generalise\nto the open-ended generation setting, effectively circumventing safety\nguardrails. We demonstrate that intervening on a few attention heads is more\neffective than intervening on full layers or supervised fine-tuning.

We also\ndemonstrate that applying interventions in the negative direction can prevent a\ncommon jailbreak attack.

We demonstrate this phenomenon in Mn[Co]-Prussian Blue\nAnalogues, disordered cyanide crystals containing numerous Co(CN)$_6$\nvacancies. Single crystal diffuse scattering reveals pronounced anisotropy in\nvacancy distribution: strong correlations along [001] growth direction contrast\nwith weak correlations perpendicular to it.

Here, we apply the\nneuroscientific theory of Active Inference to HCI, postulating that users\nperform Bayesian inference on progress and goal distributions to predict their\nnext action (Interactive Inference). We show how Bayesian surprise between goal\nand progress distributions follows a mean square error function of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the task. However, capacity to process Bayesian\nsurprise follows the logarithm of SNR, and errors occur when average capacity\nis exceeded. Our model allows the quantitative analysis of performance and\nerror in one framework with real-time estimation of mental load. We show\nthrough mathematical theorems how three basic laws of HCI, Hick's Law, Fitts'\nLaw and the Power Law fit our model. We then test the validity of the general\nmodel by empirically measuring how well it predicts human performance in a car\nfollowing task. Results suggest that driver processing capacity indeed is a\nlogarithmic function of the SNR of the distance to a lead car. This positive\nresult provides initial evidence that Interactive Interference can work as a\nnew theoretical underpinning for HCI, deserving further exploration.",

Using communication\ncomplexity, we prove an information-theoretic lower bound demonstrating that\nonce either $M$ or $N$ is large enough, no interaction or rationality can avoid\nintrinsic alignment overheads. This barrier establishes rigorous intrinsic\nlimits to alignment \\emph{itself}, not merely to specific methods, clarifying a\ncrucial ``no free lunch'' principle: encoding ``all human values'' inevitably\nleads to misalignment, requiring future methods to explicitly manage complexity\nthrough consensus-driven reduction or prioritization of objectives.\nComplementing this impossibility result, we provide explicit algorithms\nachieving alignment under both computationally unbounded and bounded\nrationality with noisy messages.

Since word\nchoices are inherently subjective, ground-truth word substitutions generated by\na small group of annotators are often incomplete and likely not generalizable.\nTo circumvent this issue, we instead employ a model-based score (BARTScore) to\nquantify sentence quality, thus forgoing the need for human annotations.\nSpecifically, we use this score to define a distribution for each word\nsubstitution, allowing one to test whether a substitution is statistically\nsuperior relative to others. In addition, we propose a loss function that\ndirectly optimizes the alignment between model predictions and sentence scores,\nwhile also enhancing the overall quality score of a substitution.

Current watermarking methods, particularly those using abstract\ntrigger sets, lack robust authentication and fail to address the unique\nchallenges of EEG models. This paper introduces a cryptographic wonder\nfilter-based watermarking framework tailored for EEG-based neural networks.\nLeveraging collision-resistant hashing and public-key encryption, the wonder\nfilter embeds the watermark during training, ensuring minimal distortion ($\\leq\n5\\%$ drop in EEG task accuracy) and high reliability (100\\% watermark\ndetection). The framework is rigorously evaluated against adversarial attacks,\nincluding fine-tuning, transfer learning, and neuron pruning. Results\ndemonstrate persistent watermark retention, with classification accuracy for\nwatermarked states remaining above 90\\% even after aggressive pruning, while\nprimary task performance degrades faster, deterring removal attempts. Piracy\nresistance is validated by the inability to embed secondary watermarks without\nsevere accuracy loss ( $>10\\%$ in EEGNet and CCNN models). Cryptographic\nhashing ensures authentication, reducing brute-force attack success\nprobabilities. Evaluated on the DEAP dataset across models (CCNN, EEGNet,\nTSception), the method achieves $>99.4\\%$ null-embedding accuracy, effectively\neliminating false positives. By integrating wonder filters with EEG-specific\nadaptations, this work bridges a critical gap in IP protection for\nneurophysiological models, offering a secure, tamper-proof solution for\nhealthcare and biometric applications.

This new\ndevelopment practice requires researchers to urgently investigate whether\ncommonly used LLMs can effectively analyze large file-sized inputs, in order to\nprovide timely insights for software developers and engineers about the pros\nand cons of this emerging technological trend. Hence, the goal of this paper is\nto evaluate the effectiveness of several state-of-the-art chat-based LLMs,\nincluding the GPT models, in detecting in-file vulnerabilities. We conducted a\ncostly investigation into how the performance of LLMs varies based on\nvulnerability type, input size, and vulnerability location within the file. To\ngive enough statistical power to our study, we could only focus on the three\nmost common (as well as dangerous) vulnerabilities: XSS, SQL injection, and\npath traversal. Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of LLMs in\ndetecting these vulnerabilities is strongly influenced by both the location of\nthe vulnerability and the overall size of the input. Specifically, regardless\nof the vulnerability type, LLMs tend to significantly (p < .05) underperform\nwhen detecting vulnerabilities located toward the end of larger files, a\npattern we call the 'lost-in-the-end' effect. Finally, to further support\nsoftware developers and practitioners, we also explored the optimal input size\nfor these LLMs and presented a simple strategy for identifying it, which can be\napplied to other models and vulnerability types. Eventually, we show how\nadjusting the input size can lead to significant improvements in LLM-based\nvulnerability detection, with an average recall increase of over 37% across all\nmodels.",

For SWSU-PASS, we design a scalable codebook, based\non which we propose a three-stage beam training (3SBT) scheme. Specifically, 1)\nfirstly, the 3SBT scheme utilizes one activated pinching antenna to obtain a\ncoarse one-dimensional location at the first stage; 2) secondly, it achieves\nfurther phase matching with an increased number of activated antennas at the\nsecond stage; 3) finally, it realizes precise beam alignment through an\nexhaustive search at the third stage. For SWMU-PASS, based on the scalable\ncodebook design, we propose an improved 3SBT scheme to support non-orthogonal\nmultiple access (NOMA) transmission. For MWMU-PASS, we first present a\ngeneralized expression of the received signal based on the partially-connected\nhybrid beamforming structure. Furthermore, we introduce an\nincreased-dimensional scalable codebook design, based on which an\nincreased-dimensional 3SBT scheme is proposed. Numerical results reveal that:\ni) the proposed beam training scheme can significantly reduce the training\noverhead compared to the two-dimensional exhaustive search, while maintaining\nreasonable rate performance; ii) compared to fixed-location pinching antennas\nand conventional array antennas, the proposed dynamic pinching antennas yield\nbetter flexibility and improved performance.",

While prior work has focused on localized\nphenomena such as opinion formation and information spread, its potential to\ncapture global network dynamics remains underexplored. This paper addresses\nthis gap by analyzing GABM-based social media simulations through the lens of\nthe Friendship Paradox (FP), a counterintuitive phenomenon where individuals,\non average, have fewer friends than their friends. We propose a GABM framework\nfor social media simulations, featuring generative agents that emulate real\nusers with distinct personalities and interests. Using Twitter datasets on the\nUS 2020 Election and the QAnon conspiracy, we show that the FP emerges\nnaturally in GABM simulations. Consistent with real-world observations, the\nsimulations unveil a hierarchical structure, where agents preferentially\nconnect with others displaying higher activity or influence. Additionally, we\nfind that infrequent connections primarily drive the FP, reflecting patterns in\nreal networks. These findings validate GABM as a robust tool for modeling\nglobal social media phenomena and highlight its potential for advancing social\nscience by enabling nuanced analysis of user behavior.",

    "abstract": "A perturbative ac field superposed on a dc bias ($J_b$) is known to excite\nthe Higgs mode in superconductors. The dirty limit, where disorder enhances the\nHiggs resonance, provides an ideal setting for this study and is also relevant\nto many superconducting devices operating under strong dc biases. In this\npaper, we derive a general formula for the complex conductivity of disordered\nsuperconductors under an arbitrary dc bias using the Keldysh-Usadel theory of\nnonequilibrium superconductivity. This formula is relatively simple, making it\nmore accessible to a broader research community. Our analysis reveals that in a\nstrongly dc-biased dirty-limit superconductor, the Higgs mode induces an\ninstability in the homogeneous superflow within a specific frequency window,\nmaking the high-current-carrying state vulnerable to ac perturbations. This\ninstability, which occurs exclusively in the ${\\rm ac} \\parallel {\\rm dc}$\nconfiguration, leads to a non-monotonic dependence of kinetic inductance on\nfrequency and bias strength. By carefully tuning the dc bias and the frequency\nof the ac perturbation, the kinetic inductance can be enhanced by nearly two\norders of magnitude. In the weak dc bias regime, our formula recovers the\nwell-known quadratic dependence, $L_k \\propto 1+ C(J_b/J_{\\rm dp})^2$, with\ncoefficients $C=0.409$ for ${\\rm ac} \\parallel {\\rm dc}$ and $C=0.136$ for\n${\\rm ac} \\perp {\\rm dc}$, where $J_{\\rm dp}$ is the equilibrium depairing\ncurrent density. These findings establish a robust theoretical framework for\ndc-biased superconducting systems and suggest that Higgs mode physics could be\nexploited in the design and optimization of superconducting detectors.\nMoreover, they may lead to a yet-to-be-explored detector concept based on Higgs\nmode physics.",

    "abstract": "Completing Long-Horizon (LH) tasks in open-ended worlds is an important yet\ndifficult problem for embodied agents. Existing approaches suffer from two key\nchallenges: (1) they heavily rely on experiences obtained from human-created\ndata or curricula, lacking the ability to continuously update multimodal\nexperiences, and (2) they may encounter catastrophic forgetting issues when\nfaced with new tasks, lacking the ability to continuously update world\nknowledge. To solve these challenges, this paper presents EvoAgent, an\nautonomous-evolving agent with a continual World Model (WM), which can\nautonomously complete various LH tasks across environments through\nself-planning, self-control, and self-reflection, without human intervention.\nOur proposed EvoAgent contains three modules, i.e., i) the memory-driven\nplanner which uses an LLM along with the WM and interaction memory, to convert\nLH tasks into executable sub-tasks; ii) the WM-guided action controller which\nleverages WM to generate low-level actions and incorporates a self-verification\nmechanism to update multimodal experiences; iii) the experience-inspired\nreflector which implements a two-stage curriculum learning algorithm to select\nexperiences for task-adaptive WM updates. Moreover, we develop a continual\nWorld Model for EvoAgent, which can continuously update the multimodal\nexperience pool and world knowledge through closed-loop dynamics. We conducted\nextensive experiments on Minecraft, compared with existing methods, EvoAgent\ncan achieve an average success rate improvement of 105% and reduce ineffective\nactions by more than 6x.",

However, the\ncurrent SNN community focuses primarily on performance improvement by\ndeveloping large-scale models, which limits the applicability of SNNs in\nresource-limited edge devices. In this paper, we propose a hardware-friendly\nand lightweight SNN, aimed at effectively deploying high-performance SNN in\nresource-limited scenarios. Specifically, we first develop a baseline model\nthat integrates uniform quantization and structured pruning, called QP-SNN\nbaseline. While this baseline significantly reduces storage demands and\ncomputational costs, it suffers from performance decline. To address this, we\nconduct an in-depth analysis of the challenges in quantization and pruning that\nlead to performance degradation and propose solutions to enhance the baseline's\nperformance. For weight quantization, we propose a weight rescaling strategy\nthat utilizes bit width more effectively to enhance the model's representation\ncapability. For structured pruning, we propose a novel pruning criterion using\nthe singular value of spatiotemporal spike activities to enable more accurate\nremoval of redundant kernels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nintegrating two proposed methods into the baseline allows QP-SNN to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance and efficiency, underscoring its potential for\nenhancing SNN deployment in edge intelligence computing.",

Phenomena related to this plasmonic non-reciprocity --\nwhich is relatively more pronounced in two-dimensional conductors than in bulk\nconductors and could lead to solid-state device applications -- have been\nstudied in THz and optical spectral regimes. Here we demonstrate the plasmonic\nnon-reciprocity at microwave frequencies (10 $\\sim$ 50 GHz).

    "abstract": "Extreme Solar Energetic Particle Events (ESPEs) were identified almost a\ndecade ago, providing context for super events unleashed by our host star, the\nSun. Their assumed solar origin drives the question of their ``worst-case\"\nimpact, which could be profound, multifaceted, and devastating for our\ntechnological society. A methodology that directly relates the soft X-ray flux\n$F_{SXR}$ of the driving solar flare of a Solar Energetic Particle event to its\n``worst-case\" integral fluence spectrum has recently been proposed by\nPapaioannou et al. (2023). We employ this method to the ESPEs that have been\nconfirmed in cosmogenic radionuclide records up to date, retrieve their\n``worst-case\" integral spectrum, and compare the latter to the actual --\nindependently obtained -- recent reconstructions based on the radionuclide\nrecords. We first show that our method allows us to estimate the integral\nfluence spectra of one of the paleo events, i.e., AD774/775, one of the\nstrongest ESPEs found within the cosmogenic radionuclide records so far. We\nthen implement a mean ESPE utilizing four confirmed paleo ESPEs (i.e.,\nAD993/994, AD774/775, 660 BCE, and 7176 BCE) and test the resulting spectrum\nagainst the estimated one. Finally, we test the same methodology for a series\nof strong SEPs recorded on the Earth's surface as Ground Level Enhancements\n(GLEs). In all investigated cases, the recent re-calibration of $F_{SXR}$ by\nHudson et al. (2024) is considered. We conclude that the methodology can\nadequately estimate the ``worst-case\" integral fluence spectra for both strong\nand extreme SEP events, quantifying their impact up to an integral energy of\n$\\sim$ E $>$ 1 GeV.",

Considerable efforts in designing\ncomplex spherical convolutions or polyhedron reprojection offer significant\nperformance improvements but at the expense of cumbersome processing procedures\nand slower inference speeds. Under these circumstances, this paper proposes a\nnew ODI-SR model characterized by its capacity to perform Fast and\nArbitrary-scale ODI-SR processes, denoted as FAOR. The key innovation lies in\nadapting the implicit image function from the planar image domain to the ERP\nimage domain by incorporating spherical geometric priors at both the latent\nrepresentation and image reconstruction stages, in a low-overhead manner.\nSpecifically, at the latent representation stage, we adopt a pair of pixel-wise\nand semantic-wise sphere-to-planar distortion maps to perform affine\ntransformations on the latent representation, thereby incorporating it with\nspherical properties. Moreover, during the image reconstruction stage, we\nintroduce a geodesic-based resampling strategy, aligning the implicit image\nfunction with spherical geometrics without introducing additional parameters.\nAs a result, the proposed FAOR outperforms the state-of-the-art ODI-SR models\nwith a much faster inference speed.

More specifically, we establish an upper bound\nfor the average number of lattice points in a $\\delta$-neighborhood of a\nKor\\'anyi sphere of large radius, where the average considered is over\nHeisenberg group translations of the sphere. This is in contrast with previous\nworks, which either count lattice points on dilates of a fixed sphere (see\n\\cites{GNT, Gath2}) or consider averages over Euclidean translations of the\nsphere (see \\cites{CT}). We observe that incorporating the Heisenberg group\nstructure allows us to circumvent the degeneracy arising from the vanishing of\nthe Gaussian curvature at the poles of the Kor\\'anyi sphere. In fact, in lower\ndimensions (the first and second Heisenberg group), our method establishes an\nupper bound for this number which gives a logarithmic improvement over the\nbound implied by the previously known results.

Numerical\nanalyses and simulations demonstrated that the proposed coil structure delivers\nthe same amount of power as spiral coils, while achieving an 86.6% reduction in\nmagnetic field intensity at a plane located 75 mm away from the resonator pair\nand a power efficiency of 96.0%. We verified our approach by measuring the\npower efficiency and magnetic field intensity of a test wireless power system\noperating at 6.78 MHz. These findings indicate that our approach can\nefficiently deliver over 50 times more power without increasing magnetic field\nexposure, making it a promising solution for high-power wireless power transfer\napplications.",

Although these systems are ubiquitous in our lives, the nature and\nthe causes of their non-trivial collective dynamics still remain elusive and\nhave attracted significant interest in non-equilibrium physics. Here, we focus\non the vibrational dynamics of granular materials. While the vibrational\ndynamics of random packings have been examined concerning the jamming\ntransition, previous research has overlooked the role of contact dissipations.\nWe conducted numerical and analytical investigations into the vibrational\ndynamics of random packings influenced by the normal dissipative force, which\nis the simplest model for contact dissipations. Our findings reveal that the\nkinetic energy per mode diverges in the low-frequency range, following the\nscaling law $\\mathcal{K}_l \\propto \\omega^{-2}_l$ with the frequency\n$\\omega_l$, indicating that low-frequency modes experience strong excitation\nand that the equipartition of energy is violated. Additionally, the spatial\nstructure factor of the velocity field displays the scaling law $S_v(q) \\propto\nq^{-2}$ with the wavenumber $q$, which signifies that the velocity field has an\ninfinitely long range. We demonstrate that these phenomena arise from the\neffects of weaker damping on softer modes, where the particle displacements\nparallel to the contacts are minimal in the low-frequency modes, rendering\nnormal dissipation ineffective at dampening these modes.",

Due to the nascency of the field, it is not well-established\nwhether LMs exhibit similar learning dynamics to humans, and there are few\ndirect comparisons between learning trajectories in humans and models. Word\nlearning trajectories for children are relatively well-documented, and recent\nwork has tried to extend these investigations to language models. However,\nthere are no widely agreed-upon metrics for word learning in language models.\nWe take a distributional approach to this problem, defining lexical knowledge\nin terms of properties of the learned distribution for a target word. We argue\nthat distributional signatures studied in prior work fail to capture key\ndistributional information. Thus, we propose an array of signatures that\nimprove on earlier approaches by capturing knowledge of both where the target\nword can and cannot occur as well as gradient preferences about the word's\nappropriateness. We obtain learning trajectories for a selection of small\nlanguage models we train from scratch, study the relationship between different\ndistributional signatures, compare how well they align with human word learning\ntrajectories and interpretable lexical features, and address basic\nmethodological questions about estimating these distributional signatures. Our\nmetrics largely capture complementary information, suggesting that it is\nimportant not to rely on a single metric.

An issue that is known to\nundermine the traditional classification task that assumes a continuous data\nstream. Previous works addressed this issue by designing bespoke solutions\n(i.e. task-specific and/or modality-specific imputation). These approaches,\nwhile effective for their intended purposes, had limitations in their\napplicability across different tasks and sensor modalities. This raises an\nimportant question: Can we build a task-agnostic imputation pipeline that is\ntransferable to new sensors without requiring additional training? In this\nwork, we formalise the concept of zero-shot imputation and propose a novel\napproach that enables the adaptation of pre-trained models to handle data\nintermittency. This framework, named NeuralPrefix, is a generative neural\ncomponent that precedes a task model during inference, filling in gaps caused\nby data intermittency. NeuralPrefix is built as a continuous dynamical system,\nwhere its internal state can be estimated at any point in time by solving an\nOrdinary Differential Equation (ODE). This approach allows for a more versatile\nand adaptable imputation method, overcoming the limitations of task-specific\nand modality-specific solutions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of\nNeuralPrefix on multiple sensory datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness\nacross various domains.

    "abstract": "Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a central natural language processing (NLP)\ntask aiming to understand the semantic roles within texts, facilitating a wide\nrange of downstream applications. While SRL has garnered extensive and enduring\nresearch, there is currently a lack of a comprehensive survey that thoroughly\norganizes and synthesizes the field. This paper aims to review the entire\nresearch trajectory of the SRL community over the past two decades. We begin by\nproviding a complete definition of SRL. To offer a comprehensive taxonomy, we\ncategorize SRL methodologies into four key perspectives: model architectures,\nsyntax feature modeling, application scenarios, and multi-modal extensions.\nFurther, we discuss SRL benchmarks, evaluation metrics, and paradigm modeling\napproaches, while also exploring practical applications across various domains.\nFinally, we analyze future research directions in SRL, addressing the evolving\nrole of SRL in the age of large language models (LLMs) and its potential impact\non the broader NLP landscape.

Recent\nadvancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in addressing\nmental health challenges, including the detection of depression through\ntext-based analysis. However, current LLM-based methods often struggle with\nnuanced symptom identification and lack a transparent, step-by-step reasoning\nprocess, making it difficult to accurately classify and explain mental health\nconditions. To address these challenges, we propose a Chain-of-Thought\nPrompting approach that enhances both the performance and interpretability of\nLLM-based depression detection. Our method breaks down the detection process\ninto four stages: (1) sentiment analysis, (2) binary depression classification,\n(3) identification of underlying causes, and (4) assessment of severity. By\nguiding the model through these structured reasoning steps, we improve\ninterpretability and reduce the risk of overlooking subtle clinical indicators.\nWe validate our method on the E-DAIC dataset, where we test multiple\nstate-of-the-art large language models. Experimental results indicate that our\nChain-of-Thought Prompting technique yields superior performance in both\nclassification accuracy and the granularity of diagnostic insights, compared to\nbaseline approaches.",

However, this task remains challenging due to the\ndifficulty of retrieving subtle yet high-impact patterns from noisy financial\ntime-series data, where conventional retrieval methods, whether based on\ngeneric language models or simplistic numeric similarity, often fail to capture\nthe intricate temporal dependencies and context-specific signals essential for\nprecise market prediction. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinSrag, the first\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework with a novel domain-specific\nretriever FinSeer for financial time-series forecasting. FinSeer leverages a\ncandidate selection mechanism refined by LLM feedback and a similarity-driven\ntraining objective to align queries with historically influential sequences\nwhile filtering out financial noise. Such training enables FinSeer to identify\nthe most relevant time-series data segments for downstream forecasting tasks,\nunlike embedding or distance-based retrieval methods used in existing RAG\nframeworks. The retrieved patterns are then fed into StockLLM, a 1B-parameter\nLLM fine-tuned for stock movement prediction, which serves as the generative\nbackbone. Beyond the retrieval method, we enrich the retrieval corpus by\ncurating new datasets that integrate a broader set of financial indicators,\ncapturing previously overlooked market dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that\nFinSeer outperforms existing textual retrievers and traditional distance-based\nretrieval approaches in enhancing the prediction accuracy of StockLLM,\nunderscoring the importance of domain-specific retrieval frameworks in handling\nthe complexity of financial time-series data.",

In this context, we are often\nconfronted with the problem that data is sparse and uncertain. To use the\navailable data as best as possible, inference approaches that can handle this\nuncertainty are required. One way that allows us to use not only\ncross-sectional data, but also phylogenetic related and longitudinal data, is\nusing `hypercubic inference' models. In this article we introduce HyperLAU, a\nnew algorithm for hypercubic inference that makes it possible to use datasets\nincluding uncertainties for learning evolutionary pathways. Expanding the\nflexibility of accumulation modelling, HyperLAU allows us to infer dynamic\npathways and interactions between features, even when large sets of particular\nfeatures are unobserved across the source dataset. We show that HyperLAU is\nable to highlight the main pathways found by other tools, even when up to 50%\nof the features in the input data are uncertain. Additionally, we demonstrate\nhow it can help to overcome possible biases that can occur then reducing the\nused data by excluding uncertain parts. We illustrate the approach with a case\nstudy on multidrug resistance in tuberculosis, showing that HyperLAU allows\nmore flexible data and provides new information about evolutionary pathways\ncompared to existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in skeleton-based human\naction recognition, yet their quadratic computational complexity remains a\nbottleneck for real-world applications. To mitigate this, linear attention\nmechanisms have been explored but struggle to capture the hierarchical\nstructure of skeleton data. Meanwhile, the Poincar\\'e model, as a typical\nhyperbolic geometry, offers a powerful framework for modeling hierarchical\nstructures but lacks well-defined operations for existing mainstream linear\nattention. In this paper, we propose HyLiFormer, a novel hyperbolic linear\nattention Transformer tailored for skeleton-based action recognition. Our\napproach incorporates a Hyperbolic Transformation with Curvatures (HTC) module\nto map skeleton data into hyperbolic space and a Hyperbolic Linear Attention\n(HLA) module for efficient long-range dependency modeling. Theoretical analysis\nand extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate\nthat HyLiFormer significantly reduces computational complexity while preserving\nmodel accuracy, making it a promising solution for efficiency-critical\napplications.",

Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence in LP, with Graph AutoEncoders\n(GAEs) being a notable representation. However, our empirical findings reveal\nthat GAEs' LP performance suffers heavily from the long-tailed node degree\ndistribution, i.e., low-degree nodes tend to exhibit inferior LP performance\ncompared to high-degree nodes. \\emph{What causes this degree-related bias, and\nhow can it be mitigated?} In this study, we demonstrate that the norm of node\nembeddings learned by GAEs exhibits variation among nodes with different\ndegrees, underscoring its central significance in influencing the final\nperformance of LP. Specifically, embeddings with larger norms tend to guide the\ndecoder towards predicting higher scores for positive links and lower scores\nfor negative links, thereby contributing to superior performance. This\nobservation motivates us to improve GAEs' LP performance on low-degree nodes by\nincreasing their embedding norms, which can be implemented simply yet\neffectively by introducing additional self-loops into the training objective\nfor low-degree nodes. This norm augmentation strategy can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing GAE methods with light computational cost.

    "abstract": "Enabling robots to perform diverse tasks across varied environments is a\ncentral challenge in robot learning. While vision-language-action (VLA) models\nhave shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full\npotential requires addressing limitations in action representation and\nefficient training. Current VLA models often focus on scaling the\nvision-language model (VLM) component, while the action space representation\nremains a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces DexVLA, a novel framework\ndesigned to enhance the efficiency and generalization capabilities of VLAs for\ncomplex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments. DexVLA features a\nnovel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters, designed\nfor cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy\nfacilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert that is\nseparable from the VLA on cross-embodiment data, (2) aligning the VLA model to\nspecific embodiments, and (3) post-training for rapid adaptation to new tasks.\nWe conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple embodiments, including\nsingle-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating DexVLA's adaptability\nto challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its ability to learn\ndexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its capacity to\ncomplete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting, such\nas laundry folding. In all settings, our method demonstrates superior\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art models like Octo, OpenVLA, and\nDiffusion Policy.",

    "abstract": "Sequential pattern mining (SPM) with gap constraints (or repetitive SPM or\ntandem repeat discovery in bioinformatics) can find frequent repetitive\nsubsequences satisfying gap constraints, which are called positive sequential\npatterns with gap constraints (PSPGs). However, classical SPM with gap\nconstraints cannot find the frequent missing items in the PSPGs. To tackle this\nissue, this paper explores negative sequential patterns with gap constraints\n(NSPGs). We propose an efficient NSPG-Miner algorithm that can mine both\nfrequent PSPGs and NSPGs simultaneously. To effectively reduce candidate\npatterns, we propose a pattern join strategy with negative patterns which can\ngenerate both positive and negative candidate patterns at the same time. To\ncalculate the support (frequency of occurrence) of a pattern in each sequence,\nwe explore a NegPair algorithm that employs a key-value pair array structure to\ndeal with the gap constraints and the negative items simultaneously and can\navoid redundant rescanning of the original sequence, thus improving the\nefficiency of the algorithm. To report the performance of NSPG-Miner, 11\ncompetitive algorithms and 11 datasets are employed. The experimental results\nnot only validate the effectiveness of the strategies adopted by NSPG-Miner,\nbut also verify that NSPG-Miner can discover more valuable information than the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.

    "abstract": "In billboard advertisement, a number of digital billboards are owned by an\ninfluence provider, and several commercial houses (which we call advertisers)\napproach the influence provider for a specific number of views of their\nadvertisement content on a payment basis. Though the billboard slot allocation\nproblem has been studied in the literature, this problem still needs to be\naddressed from a fairness point of view. In this paper, we introduce the Fair\nBillboard Slot Allocation Problem, where the objective is to allocate a given\nset of billboard slots among a group of advertisers based on their demands\nfairly and efficiently. As fairness criteria, we consider the maximin fair\nshare, which ensures that each advertiser will receive a subset of slots that\nmaximizes the minimum share for all the advertisers. We have proposed a\nsolution approach that generates an allocation and provides an approximate\nmaximum fair share. The proposed methodology has been analyzed to understand\nits time and space requirements and a performance guarantee. It has been\nimplemented with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets, and the results\nhave been reported. The results show that the proposed approach leads to a\nbalanced allocation by satisfying the maximin fairness criteria. At the same\ntime, it maximizes the utility of advertisers.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses an extension technology for the previously proposed\nFlexible Line-Commutated Converter (Flex LCC) [1]. The proposed extension\ninvolves modifying the arm internal-electromotive-force control, redesigning\nthe main-circuit parameters, and integrating a low-power coordination strategy.\nAs a result, the Flex-LCC transforms from a grid-forming (GFM) voltage source\nconverter (VSC) based on series-connected LCC and FBMMC into a novel GFM HVDC\nseries tapping converter, referred to as the Extended Flex-LCC (EFLCC). The\nEFLCC provides dc characteristics resembling those of current source converters\n(CSCs) and ac characteristics resembling those of GFM VSCs. This makes it\neasier to integrate relatively small renewable energy sources (RESs) that\noperate in islanded or weak-grid supported conditions with an existing\nLCC-HVDC. Meanwhile, the EFLCC distinguishes itself by requiring fewer\nfull-controlled switches and less energy storage, resulting in lower losses and\ncosts compared to the FBMMC HVDC series tap solution. In particular, the\nreduced capacity requirement and the wide allowable range of valve-side ac\nvoltages in the FBMMC part facilitate the matching of current-carrying\ncapacities between full-controlled switches and thyristors. The application\nscenario, system-level analysis, implementation, converter-level operation, and\ncomparison of the EFLCC are presented in detail in this paper. The theoretical\nanalysis is confirmed by experimental and simulation results.",

The dispersion measure (DM) and scattering time ($\\tau$)\ndistributions provide key insights into FRBs' properties, including source\npopulation, redshift, and energy distribution. We use a simplified model of FRB\nsource population and intrinsic Schechter function-like energy distribution,\ncoupled with a thorough assessment of various contributors to dispersion and\nscattering, to replicate the joint distribution of DM and $\\tau$ in the\nCHIME/FRB catalog.

Contributions to the DM and $\\tau$ from\ninterstellar medium (ISM), circumgalactic medium (CGM) within host and\nforeground halos are informed by the IllustrisTNG simulation, while\ncontributions from the Milky Way, intergalactic medium (IGM), and local\nenvironmental are estimated by updated models. Using MCMC simulations, we\nidentify optimal model that well reproduce the DM distribution and broadly\nreproduce the $\\tau$ distribution in the CHIME/FRB catalog.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is a technique aimed at enhancing the performance of a\nsmall student network without increasing its parameter size by transferring\nknowledge from a large, pre-trained teacher network. In the feature space,\ndifferent local regions within an individual global feature map often encode\ndistinct yet interdependent semantic information. However, previous methods\nmainly focus on transferring global feature knowledge, neglecting the\ndecoupling of interdependent local regions within an individual global feature,\nwhich often results in suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we\npropose MSDCRD, a novel contrastive representation distillation approach that\nexplicitly performs multi-scale decoupling within the feature space. MSDCRD\nemploys a multi-scale sliding-window pooling approach within the feature space\nto capture representations at various granularities effectively. This, in\nconjunction with sample categorization, facilitates efficient multi-scale\nfeature decoupling. When integrated with a novel and effective contrastive loss\nfunction, this forms the core of MSDCRD. Feature representations differ\nsignificantly across network architectures, and this divergence becomes more\npronounced in heterogeneous models, rendering feature distillation particularly\nchallenging. Despite this, our method not only achieves superior performance in\nhomogeneous models but also enables efficient feature knowledge transfer across\na variety of heterogeneous teacher-student pairs, highlighting its strong\ngeneralizability. Moreover, its plug-and-play and parameter-free nature enables\nflexible integration with different visual tasks.

We also compared the SEDs\nfrom the emission line regions detected in J-PLUS images, reproducing the main\nspectral features present in the spectroscopic data. Finally, we compared the\nemission fluxes from the J-PLUS and IFU surveys accounting for scale\ndifferences, finding a difference of only 2% with a dispersion of 7% in the\nmeasurements.

    "abstract": "The problem of time in canonical quantum gravity remains one of the most\nsignificant challenges, primarily due to the ``frozen'' formalism emerging from\nthe Wheeler--DeWitt equation. Within the ADM formalism, we introduce a novel\napproach in which a scalar field is treated as a stochastic clock. By imposing\na divergence-free condition on the scalar momentum, we integrate out quantum\ngravitational fluctuations and derive an effective noise term via the\nHubbard--Stratonovich transformation. This noise drives dynamic adjustments in\nspacetime foliations, enabling a Schr\\\"{o}dinger-like evolution that preserves\ndiffeomorphism invariance and, upon noise averaging, maintains unitary\nevolution. Interestingly, by introducing stochastic variations in the\nfoliations, the quantum indeterminacy of the clock recasts time as a diffusive\nprocess emerging from quantum fluctuations -- where correlations between matter\nand geometry replace an absolute time parameter. This is considerably a\npotential pathway for understanding quantum time evolution while maintaining\nbackground independence in canonical quantum gravity.",

To this purpose, the model adopts a statistical perspective\nenvisaging a stochastic evolution of large-scale patches in the Universe with\ntypical sizes $10-50\\, h^{-1}$ Mpc, which is meant to describe the complex\ngravitational processes leading to the formation of the cosmic web. The\nstochasticity among different patches is technically rendered via the diverse\nrealizations of a multiplicative noise term (`a little ado') in the\ncosmological equations, and the overall background evolution of the Universe is\nthen operationally defined as an average over the patch ensemble. In this paper\nwe show that such an ensemble-averaged evolution in $\\eta$CDM can be described\nin terms of a spatially flat cosmology and of an `emergent' dark energy with a\ntime-dependent equation of state, able to originate the cosmic acceleration\nwith the right timing and to solve the coincidence problem. Then we test the\n$\\eta$CDM model against the most recent supernova type-I$a$, baryon acoustic\noscillations and structure growth rate datasets, finding an excellent\nagreement. Remarkably, we demonstrate that $\\eta$CDM is able to alleviate\nsimultaneously both the $H_0$ and the $f\\sigma_8$ tensions. Finally, we discuss\nthat the Linders' diagnostic test could be helpful to better distinguish\n$\\eta$CDM from the standard scenario in the near future via upcoming galaxy\nredshift surveys at intermediate redshifts such as those being conducted by the\nEuclid mission.",

Short video ads aligned with user search intents are\ndisplayed through relevance matching and bid ranking mechanisms. This paper\nfocuses on improving query-to-video relevance matching to enhance the\neffectiveness of ranking in ad systems. Recent vision-language pre-training\nmodels have demonstrated promise in various multimodal tasks. However, their\ncontribution to downstream query-video relevance tasks is limited, as the\nalignment between the pair of visual signals and text differs from the modeling\nof the triplet of the query, visual signals, and video text. In addition, our\nprevious relevance model provides limited ranking capabilities, largely due to\nthe discrepancy between the binary cross-entropy fine-tuning objective and the\nranking objective. To address these limitations, we design a high-consistency\nmultimodal relevance model (HCMRM). It utilizes a simple yet effective method\nto enhance the consistency between pre-training and relevance tasks.\nSpecifically, during the pre-training phase, along with aligning visual signals\nand video text, several keywords are extracted from the video text as\npseudo-queries to perform the triplet relevance modeling. For the fine-tuning\nphase, we introduce a hierarchical softmax loss, which enables the model to\nlearn the order within labels while maximizing the distinction between positive\nand negative samples. This promotes the fusion ranking of relevance and bidding\nin the subsequent ranking stage. The proposed method has been deployed in the\nKuaishou search advertising system for over a year, contributing to a 6.1%\nreduction in the proportion of irrelevant ads and a 1.4% increase in ad\nrevenue.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in quadrupedal robots have demonstrated impressive agility\nand the ability to traverse diverse terrains. However, hardware issues, such as\nmotor overheating or joint locking, may occur during long-distance walking or\ntraversing through rough terrains leading to locomotion failures. Although\nseveral studies have proposed fault-tolerant control methods for quadrupedal\nrobots, there are still challenges in traversing unstructured terrains. In this\npaper, we propose DreamFLEX, a robust fault-tolerant locomotion controller that\nenables a quadrupedal robot to traverse complex environments even under joint\nfailure conditions. DreamFLEX integrates an explicit failure estimation and\nmodulation network that jointly estimates the robot's joint fault vector and\nutilizes this information to adapt the locomotion pattern to faulty conditions\nin real-time, enabling quadrupedal robots to maintain stability and performance\nin rough terrains. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamFLEX outperforms\nexisting methods in both simulation and real-world scenarios, effectively\nmanaging hardware failures while maintaining robust locomotion performance.",

    "abstract": "Mixture of Experts (MoE), with its distinctive sparse structure, enables the\nscaling of language models up to trillions of parameters without significantly\nincreasing computational costs. However, the substantial parameter size\npresents a challenge for inference, as the expansion in GPU memory cannot keep\npace with the growth in parameters. Although offloading techniques utilise\nmemory from the CPU and disk and parallelise the I/O and computation for\nefficiency, the computation for each expert in MoE models is often less than\nthe I/O, resulting in numerous bubbles in the pipeline.\n  Therefore, we propose Klotski, an efficient MoE inference engine that\nsignificantly reduces pipeline bubbles through a novel expert-aware multi-batch\npipeline paradigm. The proposed paradigm uses batch processing to extend the\ncomputation time of the current layer to overlap with the loading time of the\nnext layer. Although this idea has been effectively applied to dense models,\nmore batches may activate more experts in the MoE, leading to longer loading\ntimes and more bubbles. Thus, unlike traditional approaches, we balance\ncomputation and I/O time and minimise bubbles by orchestrating their inference\norders based on their heterogeneous computation and I/O requirements and\nactivation patterns under different batch numbers. Moreover, to adapt to\ndifferent hardware environments and models, we design a constraint-sensitive\nI/O-compute planner and a correlation-aware expert prefetcher for a schedule\nthat minimises pipeline bubbles. Experimental results demonstrate that Klotski\nachieves a superior throughput-latency trade-off compared to state-of-the-art\ntechniques, with throughput improvements of up to 85.12x.",

    "abstract": "The Lambek calculus is a substructural logic known to be closely related to\nthe formal language theory: on the one hand, it is used for generating formal\nlanguages by means of categorial grammars and, on the other hand, it has formal\nlanguage semantics, with respect to which it is sound and complete. This paper\nstudies a similar relation between first-order intuitionistic linear logic ILL1\nalong with its multiplicative fragment MILL1 on the one hand and the hypergraph\ngrammar theory on the other. In the first part, we introduce a novel concept of\nhypergraph first-order logic categorial grammar, which is a generalisation of\nstring MILL1 grammars studied e.g. in Richard Moot's 2014 works. We prove that\nhypergraph ILL1 grammars generate all recursively enumerable hypergraph\nlanguages and that hypergraph MILL1 grammars are as powerful as linear-time\nhypergraph transformation systems. In addition, we show that the class of\nlanguages generated by string MILL1 grammars is closed under intersection and\nthat it includes a non-semilinear language as well as an NP-complete one. This\nshows how much more powerful string MILL1 grammars are as compared to Lambek\ncategorial grammars.\n  In the second part, we develop hypergraph language models for MILL1. In such\nmodels, formulae of the logic are interpreted as hypergraph languages and\nmultiplicative conjunction is interpreted using parallel composition, which is\none of the operations of HR-algebras introduced by Courcelle. We prove\ncompleteness of the universal-implicative fragment of MILL1 with respect to\nthese models and thus present a new kind of semantics for a fragment of\nfirst-order linear logic.",

However, the\n[\\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ sensitivity is too low to confirm this for individual\ntargets, except for a tentative (2.7$\\sigma$) CGM detection in Q0050+0051{}\nwith M$_{\\rm H_2}$\\,=\\, ($1.0 - 2.8$)$\\times 10^{10}$ $\\rm M_{\\sun}$. The\n3$\\sigma$ mass limits of molecular CGM for the remaining QSO fields are\n($0.2-1.4$)\\,$\\times$\\,10$^{10}$ $\\rm M_{\\sun}$. This translates into a baryon\nfraction of $<$0.4-3$\\% $ in the molecular CGM relative to the total baryonic\nhalo mass. Our sample also includes a radio-detected AGN, Q1416+2649{}, which\nshows [\\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ and CO(4$-$3) luminosities an order of magnitude\nfainter for its far-infrared luminosity than other QSOs in our sample, possibly\ndue to a lower molecular gas mass.",

    "abstract": "The advances in digital tools have led to the rampant spread of\nmisinformation. While fact-checking aims to combat this, manual fact-checking\nis cumbersome and not scalable. It is essential for automated fact-checking to\nbe efficient for aiding in combating misinformation in real-time and at the\nsource. Fact-checking pipelines primarily comprise a knowledge retrieval\ncomponent which extracts relevant knowledge to fact-check a claim from large\nknowledge sources like Wikipedia and a verification component. The existing\nworks primarily focus on the fact-verification part rather than evidence\nretrieval from large data collections, which often face scalability issues for\npractical applications such as live fact-checking. In this study, we address\nthis gap by exploring various methods for indexing a succinct set of factual\nstatements from large collections like Wikipedia to enhance the retrieval phase\nof the fact-checking pipeline. We also explore the impact of vector\nquantization to further improve the efficiency of pipelines that employ dense\nretrieval approaches for first-stage retrieval. We study the efficiency and\neffectiveness of the approaches on fact-checking datasets such as HoVer and\nWiCE, leveraging Wikipedia as the knowledge source. We also evaluate the\nreal-world utility of the efficient retrieval approaches by fact-checking 2024\npresidential debate and also open source the collection of claims with\ncorresponding labels identified in the debate. Through a combination of indexed\nfacts together with Dense retrieval and Index compression, we achieve up to a\n10.0x speedup on CPUs and more than a 20.0x speedup on GPUs compared to the\nclassical fact-checking pipelines over large collections.",

    "abstract": "In this letter, we propose an online scalar field estimation algorithm of\nunknown environments using a distributed Gaussian process (DGP) framework in\nwireless sensor networks (WSNs). While the kernel-based Gaussian process (GP)\nhas been widely employed for estimating unknown scalar fields, its centralized\nnature is not well-suited for handling a large amount of data from WSNs. To\novercome the limitations of the kernel-based GP, recent advancements in GP\nresearch focus on approximating kernel functions as products of E-dimensional\nnonlinear basis functions, which can handle large WSNs more efficiently in a\ndistributed manner. However, this approach requires a large number of basis\nfunctions for accurate approximation, leading to increased computational and\ncommunication complexities. To address these complexity issues, the paper\nproposes a distributed GP framework by incorporating a Kalman filter scheme\n(termed as K-DGP), which scales linearly with the number of nonlinear basis\nfunctions. Moreover, we propose a new consensus protocol designed to handle the\nunique data transmission requirement residing in the proposed K-DGP framework.\nThis protocol preserves the inherent elements in the form of a certain column\nin the nonlinear function matrix of the communicated message; it enables\nwireless sensors to cooperatively estimate the environment and reach the global\nconsensus through distributed learning with faster convergence than the\nwidely-used average consensus protocol. Simulation results demonstrate rapid\nconsensus convergence and outstanding estimation accuracy achieved by the\nproposed K-DGP algorithm. The scalability and efficiency of the proposed\napproach are further demonstrated by online dynamic environment estimation\nusing WSNs.",

To start, it is shown that the Hawking temperature and the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy are, respectively, the only possible thermodynamical\ntemperature and entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole. Moreover, it is\ninvestigated if the other known generalised entropies, which include R\\'enyi's\nentropy, the Tsallis one, and the four- and five-parameter generalised\nentropies, could correctly yield the Hawking temperature and the ADM mass. The\npossibility that generalised entropies could describe hairy black hole\nthermodynamics is also considered, both for the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m black\nhole and for Einstein's gravity coupled with two scalar fields. Two\npossibilities are investigated, namely, the case when the ADM mass does not\nyield the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and the case in which the effective mass\nexpressing the energy inside the horizon does not yield the Hawking\ntemperature. For the model with two scalar fields, the radii of the photon\nsphere and of the black hole shadow are calculated, which gives constraints on\nthe BH parameters. These constraints are seen to be consistent, provided the\nblack hole is of Schwarzschild type. Subsequently, the origin of the\ngeneralised entropies is investigated, by using their microscopic particle\ndescriptions in the frameworks of a microcanonical and of a canonical ensemble,\nrespectively. To finish, the McLaughlin expansion for the generalised entropies\nis used to derive, in each case, the microscopic interpretation of the\ngeneralised entropies, via the canonical and the grand canonical ensembles.",

Existing approaches also tend to unify\nheterogeneous modalities into a single representation, overlooking each\nmodality's unique characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose\nRAMer (Reconstruction-based Adversarial Model for Emotion Recognition), which\nrefines multi-modal representations by not only exploring modality commonality\nand specificity but crucially by leveraging reconstructed features, enhanced by\ncontrastive learning, to overcome data incompleteness and enrich feature\nquality. RAMer also introduces a personality auxiliary task to complement\nmissing modalities using modality-level attention, improving emotion reasoning.\nTo further strengthen the model's ability to capture label and modality\ninterdependency, we propose a stack shuffle strategy to enrich correlations\nbetween labels and modality-specific features. Experiments on three benchmarks,\ni.e., MEmoR, CMU-MOSEI, and $M^3ED$, demonstrate that RAMer achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in dyadic and multi-party MMER scenarios.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the Curse of Depth, a concept that highlights,\nexplains, and addresses the recent observation in modern Large Language Models\n(LLMs) where nearly half of the layers are less effective than expected. We\nfirst confirm the wide existence of this phenomenon across the most popular\nfamilies of LLMs such as Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Qwen. Our analysis,\ntheoretically and empirically, identifies that the underlying reason for the\nineffectiveness of deep layers in LLMs is the widespread usage of Pre-Layer\nNormalization (Pre-LN). While Pre-LN stabilizes the training of Transformer\nLLMs, its output variance exponentially grows with the model depth, which\nundesirably causes the derivative of the deep Transformer blocks to be an\nidentity matrix, and therefore barely contributes to the training. To resolve\nthis training pitfall, we propose LayerNorm Scaling (LNS), which scales the\nvariance of output of the layer normalization inversely by the square root of\nits depth. This simple modification mitigates the output variance explosion of\ndeeper Transformer layers, improving their contribution. Across a wide range of\nmodel sizes (130M to 7B), our experiments show that LNS consistently\noutperforms previous normalization and scaling techniques in enhancing LLM\npre-training performance. Moreover, this improvement seamlessly carries over to\nsupervised fine-tuning. All these gains can be attributed to the fact that\nLayerNorm Scaling enables deeper layers to contribute more effectively during\ntraining.

    "abstract": "Humans learn from observations and experiences to adjust their behaviours\ntowards better performance. Interacting with such dynamic humans is\nchallenging, as the robot needs to predict the humans accurately for safe and\nefficient operations. Long-term interactions with dynamic humans have not been\nextensively studied by prior works. We propose an adaptive human prediction\nmodel based on the Theory-of-Mind (ToM), a fundamental social-cognitive ability\nthat enables humans to infer others' behaviours and intentions. We formulate\nthe human internal belief about others using a game-theoretic model, which\npredicts the future motions of all agents in a navigation scenario. To estimate\nan evolving belief, we use an Unscented Kalman Filter to update the behavioural\nparameters in the human internal model. Our formulation provides unique\ninterpretability to dynamic human behaviours by inferring how the human\npredicts the robot. We demonstrate through long-term experiments in both\nsimulations and real-world settings that our prediction effectively promotes\nsafety and efficiency in downstream robot planning.

An effective lattice\nquantizer significantly enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of these\napproximations. In the context of high-dimensional lattice quantization,\nprevious work proposed utilizing low-dimensional optimal lattice quantizers and\naddressed the challenge of determining the optimal length ratio in orthogonal\nsplicing. Notably, it was demonstrated that fixed length ratios and\northogonality yield suboptimal results when combining low-dimensional lattices.\nBuilding on this foundation, another approach employed gradient descent to\nidentify optimal lattices, which inspired us to explore the use of neural\nnetworks to discover matrices that outperform those obtained from orthogonal\nsplicing methods. We propose two novel approaches to tackle this problem: the\nHousehold Algorithm and the Matrix Exp Algorithm. Our results indicate that\nboth the Household Algorithm and the Matrix Exp Algorithm achieve improvements\nin lattice quantizers across dimensions 13, 15, 17 to 19, 21, and 22.

AI developers and regulators are\ntherefore seeking ways to assure the safety of such systems, and one promising\nmethod under consideration is the use of safety cases. A safety case presents a\nstructured argument in support of a top-level claim about a safety property of\nthe system. Such top-level claims are often presented as a binary statement,\nfor example \"Deploying the AI system does not pose unacceptable risk\". However,\nin practice, it is often not possible to make such statements unequivocally.\nThis raises the question of what level of confidence should be associated with\na top-level claim. We adopt the Assurance 2.0 safety assurance methodology, and\nwe ground our work by specific application of this methodology to a frontier AI\ninability argument that addresses the harm of cyber misuse. We find that\nnumerical quantification of confidence is challenging, though the processes\nassociated with generating such estimates can lead to improvements in the\nsafety case. We introduce a method for better enabling reproducibility and\ntransparency in probabilistic assessment of confidence in argument leaf nodes\nthrough a purely LLM-implemented Delphi method.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of InnerSource adoption\nprocesses and their evolution within enterprises. First, a comparative analysis\nof Japanese and global enterprises highlights differences in the state of\nsoftware sharing, perceptions of its importance, and barriers to\nimplementation. Next, this study demonstrates that InnerSource adoption\ninvolves multi-layered, topological evolution beyond conventional staged models\nof program evolution. The research proposes three theoretical frameworks:\nInnerSource Topologies, which conceptualizes collaborative structures and\ncategorizes internal collaboration levels; the Multi-layered Incentive Model,\nwhich combines monetary and non-monetary rewards at individual and project\nlevels; and the InnerSource Circumplex Model, which helps organizations define\nInnerSource forms based on their specific needs. By mapping InnerSource\nevolution as a circumplex rather than simple staged progression, leaders can\nbetter adjust their focus during implementation. These frameworks help refine\nthe previously ambiguous concept of InnerSource from the perspectives of\nsharing scope and community growth. These findings reaffirm that successful\nInnerSource adoption requires the parallel pursuit of top-down program\nstructuring and bottom-up voluntary collaboration. They also contribute to\nfostering a sustainable innovation culture and enhancing software-sharing\npractices within enterprises. Furthermore, the newly proposed frameworks,\nparticularly the Circumplex Model, offer versatile guidelines for organizations\nof varying cultural backgrounds and scales, enabling them to flexibly redefine\nand introduce InnerSource.

    "abstract": "We explore bounce scenarios in the framework of homogeneous and isotropic\ncosmological models with arbitrary spatial curvature in the theory of gravity\nwith non-minimal derivative coupling. As expected, we find that there are no\nturning points and/or bounces in cosmological models with negative or zero\nspatial curvature. At the same time, both a turning point and a bounce can\nexist in the model with positive spatial curvature. In particular, the bounce\nis happened at $\\tau=\\tau_*$ when $a(\\tau_*)=a_{min} =(3\\zeta\\Omega_2)^{1/2}$,\nwhere $\\tau=H_0 t$ is a dimensionless cosmic time. It is important fact that\nthe value $a_{min}$ depends {\\em only} on $\\zeta$ and $\\Omega_2$, and does {\\em\nnot} depend on $\\Omega_0$, $\\Omega_3$ and $\\Omega_4$. We find that near the\nbounce $a(\\tau)\\approx a_{min}(1+\\Delta\\tau^2/18\\zeta)$ and $h(\\tau)\\approx\n\\Delta\\tau/9\\zeta$, where $\\Delta\\tau=\\tau-\\tau_*$. Thus, the scale factor\n$a(\\tau)$, the Hubble parameter $h(\\tau)$, and all corresponding geometrical\ninvariants have a regular behavior near the bounce. As well the values\ncharacterizing matter energy densities, such as $\\rho_m\\sim a^{-3}$ and\n$\\rho_r\\sim a^{-4}$, are regular near the bounce. Nevertheless, though the\nspacetime geometry and energy densities remain to be regular near the bounce,\nthe scalar field has a singular behavior there. Namely, $\\phi'\\propto\n1/\\Delta\\tau^2 \\to\\infty$ as $\\Delta\\tau\\to 0$. As a result, we conclude that\nthe complete dynamical system describing the cosmological evolution in theory\nof gravity with non-minimal derivative coupling is singular near the bounce. On\nour knowledge, such the scenario, when the spacetime geometry and matter energy\ndensities remain to be regular at approaching the universe evolution to the\nmoment of bounce, while the behavior of scalar field becomes singular, was\nunknown before. For this reason, we term this scenario as a {\\em `singular'\nbounce}.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive framework for testing and evaluating\nquality characteristics of Large Language Model (LLM) systems enhanced with\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in tourism applications. Through\nsystematic empirical evaluation of three different LLM variants across multiple\nparameter configurations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our testing\nmethodology in assessing both functional correctness and extra-functional\nproperties. Our framework implements 17 distinct metrics that encompass\nsyntactic analysis, semantic evaluation, and behavioral evaluation through LLM\njudges. The study reveals significant information about how different\narchitectural choices and parameter configurations affect system performance,\nparticularly highlighting the impact of temperature and top-p parameters on\nresponse quality. The tests were carried out on a tourism recommendation system\nfor the V\\\"armland region, utilizing standard and RAG-enhanced configurations.\nThe results indicate that the newer LLM versions show modest improvements in\nperformance metrics, though the differences are more pronounced in response\nlength and complexity rather than in semantic quality. The research contributes\npractical insights for implementing robust testing practices in LLM-RAG\nsystems, providing valuable guidance to organizations deploying these\narchitectures in production environments.",

    "abstract": "Despite graph neural networks' (GNNs) great success in modelling\ngraph-structured data, out-of-distribution (OOD) test instances still pose a\ngreat challenge for current GNNs. One of the most effective techniques to\ndetect OOD nodes is to expose the detector model with an additional OOD\nnode-set, yet the extra OOD instances are often difficult to obtain in\npractice. Recent methods for image data address this problem using OOD data\nsynthesis, typically relying on pre-trained generative models like Stable\nDiffusion. However, these approaches require vast amounts of additional data,\nas well as one-for-all pre-trained generative models, which are not available\nfor graph data. Therefore, we propose the GOLD framework for graph OOD\ndetection, an implicit adversarial learning pipeline with synthetic OOD\nexposure without pre-trained models. The implicit adversarial training process\nemploys a novel alternating optimisation framework by training: (1) a latent\ngenerative model to regularly imitate the in-distribution (ID) embeddings from\nan evolving GNN, and (2) a GNN encoder and an OOD detector to accurately\nclassify ID data while increasing the energy divergence between the ID\nembeddings and the generative model's synthetic embeddings. This novel approach\nimplicitly transforms the synthetic embeddings into pseudo-OOD instances\nrelative to the ID data, effectively simulating exposure to OOD scenarios\nwithout auxiliary data. Extensive OOD detection experiments are conducted on\nfive benchmark graph datasets, verifying the superior performance of GOLD\nwithout using real OOD data compared with the state-of-the-art OOD exposure and\nnon-exposure baselines.",

Existing efforts lack the extraction and capture\nof vehicle behavior interaction features at the platoon scale. More\nimportantly, maintaining high modeling accuracy without losing physical\nanalyzability remains to be solved. To this end, this paper proposes a novel\nphysics-encoded deep learning network, named PeMTFLN, to model the nonlinear\nvehicle platoon dynamics. Specifically, an analyzable parameters encoded\ncomputational graph (APeCG) is designed to guide the platoon to respond to the\ndriving behavior of the lead vehicle while ensuring local stability. Besides, a\nmulti-scale trajectory feature learning network (MTFLN) is constructed to\ncapture platoon following patterns and infer the physical parameters required\nfor APeCG from trajectory data. The human-driven vehicle trajectory datasets\n(HIGHSIM) were used to train the proposed PeMTFLN. The trajectories prediction\nexperiments show that PeMTFLN exhibits superior compared to the baseline models\nin terms of predictive accuracy in speed and gap. The stability analysis result\nshows that the physical parameters in APeCG is able to reproduce the platoon\nstability in real-world condition. In simulation experiments, PeMTFLN performs\nlow inference error in platoon trajectories generation. Moreover, PeMTFLN also\naccurately reproduces ground-truth safety statistics.

Then, a bi-level solution is provided to obtain optimal cyber\nand physical actions, including the reconfiguration of cyber topology (e.g.,\nactivation of communication links) in the cyber layer and the control of\nphysical resources (e.g., energy storage systems) in the physical layer.

Feedback-evolving\ngames have been a prevalent framework for studying such feedback in well-mixed\npopulations, yielding important insights into the coevolutionary dynamics.\nHowever, since real populations are usually structured, it is essential to\nexplore how population structure affects such coevolutionary dynamics. Our work\nproposes a coevolution model of strategies and environmental state in a\nstructured population depicted by a regular graph. We investigate the system\ndynamics, and theoretically demonstrate that there exist different evolutionary\noutcomes including oscillation, bistability, the coexistence of oscillation and\ndominance, as well as the coexistence of cooperation and defection. Our\ntheoretical predictions are validated through numerical calculations. By using\nMonte Carlo simulations we examine how the number of neighbors influences the\ncoevolutionary dynamics, particularly the size of the attractive domain of the\nreplete environmental state in the cases of bistability or\ncooperation-defection coexistence. Specifically, in the case of bistability, a\nlarger neighborhood size may be beneficial to save the environment when the\nenvironmental enhancement rate by cooperation / degradation rate by defection\nis high. Conversely, if this ratio is low, a smaller neighborhood size is more\nbeneficial. In the case of cooperator-defector coexistence, environmental\nmaintenance is basically influenced by individual payoffs. When the ratio of\ntemptation minus reward versus punishment minus sucker's payoff is high, a\nlarger neighborhood size is more favorable.

While these important issues have been considered in the\npast, significant developments, such as the IPv6 finally getting traction, the\nadoption of the ECS extension to DNS by major DNS resolution services, and the\nembracing of anycast by some CDNs warrant a reassessment under these new\nrealities. Among the resolution services we consider, We find Google DNS and\nOpenDNS to lag behind the Cloudflare resolver and, for some CDNs, Quad9 in\nterms of DNS latency, and trace the cause to drastically lower cache hit rates.\nAt the same time, we find that Google and OpenDNS have largely closed the gap\nwith ISP resolvers in the quality of CDNs'client-to-edge-server mappings as\nmeasured by latency, while the Cloudflare resolver still shows some penalty\nwith Akamai, and Quad9 exhibits a noticeable penalty with three of the four\nCDNs in the study, keeping up only for Cloudflare CDN that does not use DNS to\nmap clients to servers. Finally, in several locations, we observe IPv6 penalty\nin the latency of client-to-CDN-edge-server mappings produced by the resolvers.\nMoreover, this penalty does not rise above typical thresholds employed by the\nHappy Eyeballs algorithm for falling back to IPv4 communication.

To this end, we propose a new\nlarge-scale anomaly detection dataset called 3CAD, which is derived from real\n3C production lines. Specifically, the proposed 3CAD includes eight different\ntypes of manufactured parts, totaling 27,039 high-resolution images labeled\nwith pixel-level anomalies.

    "abstract": "The BESIII Collaboration has recently reported a new resonance structure in\nthe cross-section analyses of the $e^+e^- \\to \\rho\\pi$ and $e^+e^- \\to\n\\rho(1450)\\pi$ processes, displaying characteristics akin to an $\\omega$-meson.\nHowever, its measured mass, $M = 2119 \\pm 11 \\pm 15 \\, \\text{MeV}$,\nsignificantly deviates from the predictions of the unquenched relativized\npotential model for conventional $\\omega$ vector meson spectroscopy.

    "abstract": "We present a phase-based framework for reducing the pressure fluctuations\nwithin a spanwise-periodic supersonic turbulent cavity flow with an incoming\nfree-stream Mach number of 1.4 and a depth-based Reynolds number of 10,000.\nOpen cavity flows exhibit large fluctuations due to the feedback between the\nshear layer instabilities and the acoustic field. The dominant flow physics\nincludes the formation, convection, and impingement of large-scale\nspanwise-oriented vortical structures. We formulate a flow control strategy to\neffectively modify the vortex convection frequency, thereby disrupting the\nfeedback loop and suppressing pressure fluctuations within the cavity. We\nimplement a phase-reduction approach to identify the flow response about the\ntime-varying convective process by defining a phase variable using dynamic mode\ndecomposition. Three-dimensional impulse perturbations are introduced from the\ncavity leading edge to characterize phase response in terms of advancement or\ndelay of convection. We perform open-loop flow control through unsteady blowing\nusing actuation frequencies slightly different from the vortex convection\nfrequency to disrupt the feedback loop. After designing a\nphase-sensitivity-based actuation waveform optimized for quick flow\nmodification, we investigate the speed of fluctuation reduction and compare it\nto a sinusoidal waveform. At a spanwise actuation wavenumber of $\\beta=2\\pi$,\nboth perform similarly, achieving a 46% reduction of pressure fluctuations\nwithin five convective times. At $\\beta=\\pi$, the phase-sensitivity-based\nactuation performs better by achieving a 40% reduction compared to the 30% with\na sinusoidal waveform within six convective times. This study shows the\npotential of phase-based analysis for timing-based flow control of unsteady\nturbulent flows.",

In this paper, we propose a novel map representation that unifies\na continuous signed distance field and a Gaussian splatting radiance field\nwithin an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map.

    "abstract": "The selection of candidate high-redshift galaxies using the dropout technique\ntargeting the Lyman-break signature sometimes yields very bright objects that\nare too luminous to be easily explained if they are indeed at the expected\nredshifts. Here we present a systematic study of very bright dropouts selected\nthrough successive bands of the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST). Using the public NIRCam data in four blank fields over\n500~arcmin$^2$, 300 such objects were found. They have F356W magnitudes\n$<25.1$~mag or $<26.0$~mag depending on the dropout passband, and the majority\nof them ($>80\\%$) have very red F115W$-$F356W colors $> 2.0$~mag, qualifying\nthem as ``extremely red objects'' (EROs). We focus on 137 objects that also\nhave mid-IR observations from the JWST MIRI instrument. Their spectral energy\ndistribution analysis shows that these objects are dominated by low-redshift\n($z\\sim1$--4) galaxies ($\\gtrsim67\\%$). However, a non-negligible fraction\n($\\gtrsim7\\%$) could be at high redshifts. Seven of our objects have secure\nspectroscopic redshifts from JWST NIRSpec identifications, and the results\nconfirm this picture: while six are low-redshift galaxies ($z\\approx3$), one is\na known galaxy at $z=8.679$ {(with $M_{\\rm UV}=-22.4$~mag and stellar mass\n$M_*=10^{9.1}M_\\odot$)} recovered in our sample. In light of recent theoretical\nmodels on early galaxy formation, this confirmed high-redshift galaxy does not\npose a challenge. However, as our sample contains very luminous high-redshift\ncandidates in the regime still underexplored ($M_{\\rm UV}\\leq -23$~mag and\n$M_*>10^{10.5}M_\\odot$), spectroscopic identifications are necessary to ensure\nthey do not create tension with these new models.",

By incorporating a\ntunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between\ncontrol costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail\npreservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with\nexisting diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications.\nExtensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the\nsuperiority and adaptability of the proposed framework.

Given mixed LLMs with their own strengths and weaknesses, LLM routing\naims to identify the most suitable model for each query in the stream to\nmaximize response quality and minimize cost and latency. However, the\nchallenges involve: (1) dynamic trade-offs among quality, cost, and latency;\n(2) enabling continual learning in deployed systems; and (3) navigating a\nvarying (e.g., new LLM addition or old LLM removal) set of LLM candidates over\ntime. To bridge these gaps, we develop MixLLM, a dynamic\ncontextual-bandit-based routing system for query-LLM assignment. Specifically,\nwe first leverage query tags to enhance query embeddings for the routing task.\nNext, we design lightweight prediction models to estimate the response\nqualities and costs of queries over LLMs. We then devise a meta-decision maker\nto choose the query-LLM assignments to best tradeoff response quality, cost,\nand latency. Finally, the system benefits from continual training, allowing it\nto adapt to evolving queries and user feedback over time. Our extensive\nexperiments show that MixLLM achieves the best trade-offs in response quality,\ncost, and latency (97.25% of GPT-4's quality at 24.18% of the cost under the\ntime constraint).",

    "abstract": "There is a general concern that present developments in artificial\nintelligence (AI) research will lead to sentient AI systems, and these may pose\nan existential threat to humanity. But why cannot sentient AI systems benefit\nhumanity instead? This paper endeavours to put this question in a tractable\nmanner. I ask whether a putative AI system will develop an altruistic or a\nmalicious disposition towards our society, or what would be the nature of its\nagency? Given that AI systems are being developed into formidable problem\nsolvers, we can reasonably expect these systems to preferentially take on\nconscious aspects of human problem solving. I identify the relevant phenomenal\naspects of agency in human problem solving. The functional aspects of conscious\nagency can be monitored using tools provided by functionalist theories of\nconsciousness. A recent expert report (Butlin et al. 2023) has identified\nfunctionalist indicators of agency based on these theories. I show how to use\nthe Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness, to monitor the\nphenomenal nature of this agency. If we are able to monitor the agency of AI\nsystems as they develop, then we can dissuade them from becoming a menace to\nsociety while encouraging them to be an aid.",

However, due to\neach node's limited perspective of the SotW, individual nodes cannot reliably\ndetermine the most supported hypothesis independently. To overcome this\nlimitation, nodes must exchange information via an intermediate server.

In this paper, we propose LALIC, a linear attention\nmodeling for learned image compression.

The framework converges on a sweet spot that satisfies critical\nperformance thresholds, illustrating that integrating problem formulation\ndiscovery into the autonomous design loop can significantly streamline the\nexperimental process. Future work will incorporate human feedback to further\nenhance the adaptability of the system in real-world experimental settings.",

    "abstract": "Environmental experts have developed the DPSIR (Driver, Pressure, State,\nImpact, Response) framework to systematically study and communicate key\nrelationships between society and the environment. Using this framework\nrequires experts to construct a DPSIR taxonomy from a corpus, annotate the\ndocuments, and identify DPSIR variables and relationships, which is laborious\nand inflexible. Automating it with conventional text mining faces technical\nchallenges, primarily because the taxonomy often begins with abstract\ndefinitions, which experts progressively refine and contextualize as they\nannotate the corpus. In response, we develop GreenMine, a system that supports\ninteractive text mining with prompt engineering. The system implements a\nprompting pipeline consisting of three simple and evaluable subtasks. In each\nsubtask, the DPSIR taxonomy can be defined in natural language and iteratively\nrefined as experts analyze the corpus. To support users evaluate the taxonomy,\nwe introduce an uncertainty score based on response consistency. Then, we\ndesign a radial uncertainty chart that visualizes uncertainties and corpus\ntopics, which supports interleaved evaluation and exploration. Using the\nsystem, experts can progressively construct the DPSIR taxonomy and annotate the\ncorpus with LLMs. Using real-world interview transcripts, we present a case\nstudy to demonstrate the capability of the system in supporting interactive\nmining of DPSIR relationships, and an expert review in the form of\ncollaborative discussion to understand the potential and limitations of the\nsystem. We discuss the lessons learned from developing the system and future\nopportunities for supporting interactive text mining in knowledge-intensive\ntasks for other application scenarios.",

    "abstract": "LeCam's two-point testing method yields perhaps the simplest lower bound for\nestimating the mean of a distribution: roughly, if it is impossible to\nwell-distinguish a distribution centered at $\\mu$ from the same distribution\ncentered at $\\mu+\\Delta$, then it is impossible to estimate the mean by better\nthan $\\Delta/2$. It is setting-dependent whether or not a nearly matching upper\nbound is attainable. We study the conditions under which the two-point testing\nlower bound can be attained for univariate mean estimation; both in the setting\nof location estimation (where the distribution is known up to translation) and\nadaptive location estimation (unknown distribution). Roughly, we will say an\nestimate nearly attains the two-point testing lower bound if it incurs error\nthat is at most polylogarithmically larger than the Hellinger modulus of\ncontinuity for $\\tilde{\\Omega}(n)$ samples.\n  Adaptive location estimation is particularly interesting as some\ndistributions admit much better guarantees than sub-Gaussian rates (e.g.\n$\\operatorname{Unif}(\\mu-1,\\mu+1)$ permits error $\\Theta(\\frac{1}{n})$, while\nthe sub-Gaussian rate is $\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}})$), yet it is not obvious\nwhether these rates may be adaptively attained by one unified approach. Our\nmain result designs an algorithm that nearly attains the two-point testing rate\nfor mixtures of symmetric, log-concave distributions with a common mean.\nMoreover, this algorithm runs in near-linear time and is parameter-free. In\ncontrast, we show the two-point testing rate is not nearly attainable even for\nsymmetric, unimodal distributions.\n  We complement this with results for location estimation, showing the\ntwo-point testing rate is nearly attainable for unimodal distributions, but\nunattainable for symmetric distributions.",
