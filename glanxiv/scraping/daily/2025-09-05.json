    "abstract": "In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to\nenhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single\naction) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that\nare tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise\nrepresentations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale\nrepresentations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More\nspecifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and\nWarp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively\nassists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross\nPermutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In\noptimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting\nrepresentations of the same action class across different permutations, while\nROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between\ntwo permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive\nLearning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations\noptimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a\ntrimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it\ndemonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both\nmulti-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies\nare conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed\napproach.",

Traditional methods assume a discrete set of conformations,\nlimiting their ability to recover continuous structural variability. In this\nwork, we formulate cryo-EM reconstruction as a stochastic inverse problem (SIP)\nover probability measures, where the observed images are modeled as the\npush-forward of an unknown distribution over molecular structures via a random\nforward operator. We pose the reconstruction problem as the minimization of a\nvariational discrepancy between observed and simulated image distributions,\nusing statistical distances such as the KL divergence and the Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy. The resulting optimization is performed over the space of\nprobability measures via a Wasserstein gradient flow, which we numerically\nsolve using particles to represent and evolve conformational ensembles. We\nvalidate our approach using synthetic examples, including a realistic protein\nmodel, which demonstrates its ability to recover continuous distributions over\nstructural states. We analyze the connection between our formulation and\nMaximum A Posteriori (MAP) approaches, which can be interpreted as instances of\nthe discretize-then-optimize (DTO) framework.

Exhaustive testing of all input combinations is\nimpractical, often resulting in undetected failures, high manual effort, and\nlimited test coverage. To address these issues, we introduce RestTSLLM, an\napproach that uses Test Specification Language (TSL) in conjunction with Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of test cases for REST APIs.\nThe approach targets two core challenges: the creation of test scenarios and\nthe definition of appropriate input data.

A common practice is to schedule interim analyses at equal\nintervals based on calendar time or accumulated data. While straightforward,\nthis approach does not completely exploit the potential sample size savings\nachievable with GSDs. To address this challenge, we develop OptimInterim, an\nR-based tool that can determine the optimal scheduling of interim analyses to\nminimise the expected sample size under the alternative hypothesis while\ncontrolling overall type I and type II errors. Our method accommodates trials\nwith continuous or binary endpoints, allows multiple interim analyses and\nsupports a range of stopping boundaries.

We illustrate its practical\nutility with two landmark trials evaluating steroid use in septic shock.\nNotably, for given type I and type II error rates, the optimal scheduling is\nindependent of endpoint types and effect sizes, ensuring broad applicability\nacross a wide range of trial contexts.

SDM represents cloud droplets as weighted superdroplets, enabling\nhigh-fidelity representations of microphysical processes such as\ncollision-coalescence. However, the algorithm can undercount collisions when\nthe expected number of events is not realizable given the superdroplet\nconfiguration, introducing a biased error referred here as the collision\ndeficit. While SDM exhibits statistical spread inherent to Monte Carlo schemes,\nthe deficit is a systematic underestimation of collision events. This error can\nbe addressed with adaptive time-stepping, which dynamically adjusts simulation\ntime steps to eliminate this deficit. We analyze the behavior of the deficit\nacross a wide range of timesteps, superdroplet counts, and initialization\nstrategies, and explore trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. Using the\nclassical Safranov-Golovin test case, we show that the deficit increases with\ntimestep and superdroplet count, and that adaptive time-stepping effectively\nremoves the associated error without significant cost. We test a smooth\ncontinuum of initial distributions with extrema representing two different\ninitialization methods, and find that while the deficit is sensitive to the\nchoice of attribute-space sampling strategies, adaptive time-stepping\nsubstantially reduces the difference, allowing for users to choose\ninitialization methods optimized for other processes. We also propose a method\nof visualization, capturing both the attribute sampling, droplet interactions\nover multiple timesteps, and the deficit using network connectivity graphs. In\n2-D flow-coupled simulations, we find the deficit can have a stronger effect on\nconvergence than previously shown, with uncorrected deficit delaying the onset\nof precipitation.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers quantile-welfare evaluation of health policy as an\nalternative to utilitarian evaluation. Manski (1988) originally proposed and\nstudied maximization of quantile utility as a model of individual decision\nmaking under uncertainty, juxtaposing it with maximization of expected utility.\nThat paper's primary motivation was to exploit the fact that maximization of\nquantile utility requires only an ordinal formalization of utility, not a\ncardinal one. This paper transfers these ideas from analysis of individual\ndecision making to analysis of social planning. We begin by summarizing basic\ntheoretical properties of quantile welfare in general terms rather than related\nspecifically to health policy. We then propose a procedure to nonparametrically\nbound the quantile welfare of health states using data from binary-choice\ntime-tradeoff (TTO) experiments of the type regularly performed by health\neconomists. After this we assess related econometric considerations concerning\nmeasurement, using the EQ-5D framework to structure our discussion.",

    "abstract": "For a certain antiferromagnet, the magnetization does not increase gradually\nwith increasing magnetic field but exhibits field region(s) typically at an\ninteger fraction of its saturation magnetization. This phenomenon is understood\nby the supposition that such an antiferromagnet undergoes field-induced\npartitioning of its spin lattice into ferrimagnetic fragments. We searched for\na theoretical basis for this supposition by investigating how external magnetic\nfields affect the magnetic entropy of such an antiferromagnet, to find that the\nfield region of the magnetization plateau has a single magnetic phase, but a\nnonzero slope region of the magnetization curve has two magnetic phases of\ndifferent magnetic entropy, and that the magnetic entropy of a single-phase\nregion does not depend on magnetic field but that of a two-phase region does.\nWe tested these predictions by carrying out magnetization and specific heat\nmeasurements for g-Mn3(PO4)2. It was found that the magnetic entropy of the\ntwo-phase region increases with field, indicating that field-induced breaking\nof magnetic bonds and hence field-induced partitioning of an antiferromagnetic\nspin lattice are time-averaged results of all allowed spin arrangements that\noccur repeatedly during static magnetization measurements. The\ntemperature-dependent magnetic specific heats of g-Mn3(PO4)2 between 2 - 6 K\nshows a larger excitation gap when measured at 9 T than at 0 T, suggesting that\nthese energy gaps reflect the two successive local excitations of linear\nMn2+-Mn2+-Mn2+ ferrimagnetic trimers embedded in the antiferromagnetic spin\nlattice of g-Mn3(PO4)2 and arise from the Boltzmann factor associated with\nthese excitations",

In addition, we compute angular distribution\nfunctions across the interface to gain insight into how the dipole shift\naffects the molecular orientation. We find that the shift significantly effects\nangular distribution functions by altering the polar order while leaving the\nnematic order relatively unaffected, in comparison to the reference symmetric\nStockmayer fluid. We find that these results are consistently explained using\nan image-dipole construction that has been previously applied to symmetric\nStockmayer fluids but has never been extended to the shifted model. We find\nremarkable agreement between the simple theory and the simulations in the\nqualitative shape of the distribution functions for both the liquid and vapor\nphases in proximity to the interface.

Detailed modeling of the light\ncurves reveals that the anomalies in all six events are caused by planetary\ncompanions to the lenses. The brief durations of the anomalies are attributed\nto various factors: a low planet-to-host mass ratio (KMT-2024-BLG-2059,\nKMT-2024-BLG-2242), a wide planet-host separation (KMT-2023-BLG-0548), small\nand elongated caustics restricting the source's interaction region\n(KMT-2023-BLG-0830, KMT-2024-BLG-1281), and a partial caustic crossing\n(KMT-2023-BLG-0949). { For KMT-2023-BLG-0548, the Bayesian posterior\ndistribution of the lens mass shows two distinct peaks: a low-mass solution\nindicating a sub-Jovian planet orbiting an M dwarf in the Galactic disk, and a\nhigh-mass solution suggesting a super-Jovian planet around a K-type dwarf in\nthe bulge.

We\nquantify the enhancement in the annihilation rate in subhalos when including\nthe contribution from particles in the smooth component of the halo that\noverlap with the subhalos. The enhancement in the annihilation rate scales with\nthe smooth component of the host halo dark matter density, and is evident for\nsubhalos over the resolvable mass range. Maximal enhancement factors are ~ 48\nfor p-wave models, and ~ 37,000 for d-wave models. For p and d-wave\nannihilation models, ~ 13 and ~ 6 subhalos, respectively, across all six host\nhalos have emission from dark matter annihilation in their direction that is\nabove the foreground emission from the smooth dark matter component, and would\ntherefore be resolvable as sources. Such subhalos with the most significant\nenhancement factors tend to be on the lower end of the mass range and located\ncloser to the center of the host galaxy. We provide a prescription to calculate\nthe enhancement for subhalos as a function of distance from the Galactic\ncenter, and use this to examine the impact on dark matter limits from a couple\nof example dwarf spheroidals.

The\nwide adoption of microservice architecture exacerbates failure management due\nto increased service components. To be effective, the strategies to enhance the\napplication service resilience need to be autonomous and developed at the\nservice's granularity, considering its end-to-end components. However, the\nmassive amount of observability data generated by all these components across\nthe service stack poses a significant challenge in reacting to anomalies and\nrestoring the service quality in real time. Identifying the most informative\nobservability data from across the cloud service stack and timely localization\nof root causes of anomalies thus becomes crucial to ensure service resilience.\nThis article presents a novel approach that considers the application service\ntopology to select the most informative metrics across the cloud stack to\nsupport efficient, explainable, and accurate root cause identifications in case\nof performance anomalies. The usefulness of the selected metrics is then\nevaluated using the state-of-the-art Root Cause Detection (RCD) algorithm for\nlocalizing the root cause of performance anomalies.

Instead of estimating\ntotal deaths averted by vaccination among both vaccinated and unvaccinated\nindividuals, some studies empirically estimated only \"directly averted\" deaths\namong vaccinated individuals, typically suggesting that vaccines prevented more\ndeaths overall than directly due to the indirect effect. Here, we define the\ncausal estimand to quantify outcomes \"directly averted\" by\nvaccination$\\unicode{x2014}$i.e., the impact of vaccination for vaccinated\nindividuals, holding vaccination coverage fixed$\\unicode{x2014}$for vaccination\nat multiple time points, and show that this estimand is a lower bound on the\ntotal outcomes averted when the indirect effect is non-negative. We develop an\nunbiased estimator for the causal estimand in a one-stage randomized controlled\ntrial (RCT) and explore the bias of a popular \"hazard difference\" estimator\nfrequently used in empirical studies. We show that even in an RCT, the hazard\ndifference estimator is biased if vaccination has a non-null effect, as it\nfails to incorporate the greater depletion of susceptibles among the\nunvaccinated individuals. In simulations, the overestimation is small for\naverted deaths when infection-fatality rate is low, as for many important\npathogens. However, the overestimation can be large for averted infections\ngiven a high basic reproduction number. Additionally, we define and compare\nestimand and estimators for avertible outcomes (i.e., outcomes that could have\nbeen averted by vaccination, but were not due to failure to vaccinate).

These complex designs often combine\none or more processors, interconnects, and peripherals to perform tasks in\nhardware or interact with the environment. Verifying these subsystems is a\nwell-suited task for VPs, as they allow reasoning across different abstraction\nlevels. While modern verification techniques like symbolic execution can be\nseamlessly integrated into VP-based workflows, they require modifications in\nthe SystemC kernel. Hence, existing approaches therefore modify and replace the\nSystemC kernel, or ignore the opportunity of cross-level scenarios completely,\nand would not allow focusing on special challenges of particular subsystems\nlike peripherals. We propose CrosSym and SEFOS, two opposing approaches for a\nversatile symbolic execution of peripherals. CrosSym modifies the SystemC\nkernel, while SEFOS instead modifies a modern symbolic execution engine. Our\nextensive evaluation applies our tools to various peripherals on different\nlevels of abstractions. Both tools extensive sets of features are demonstrated\nfor (1) different verification scenarios, and (2) identifying 300+ mutants. In\ncomparison with each other, SEFOS convinces with the unmodified SystemC kernel\nand peripheral, while CrosSym offers slightly better runtime and memory usage.\nIn comparison to the state-of-the-art, that is limited to Transaction Level\nModelling (TLM), our tools offered comparable runtime, while enabling\ncross-level verification with symbolic execution.",

We consider a defense scenario in which one\nplayer (the Defender) seeks to infer and exploit the abstraction used by the\nother player (the Attacker). The interaction between the two players is modeled\nas a Bayesian game: the Defender selects a barrier configuration, i.e., a\nplacement of obstacles that can obstruct the Attacker's movement, based on its\nbelief about the Attacker's abstraction, while the Attacker chooses a\ntrajectory that may intentionally obfuscate its own abstraction of the\nenvironment to mislead the Defender.

The majority of comets exhibit a very similar, i.e. typical,\ncomposition in optical wavelengths, though the existence of anomalous comets\nwith lower abundances of carbon-chain molecules relative to CN has long been\nknown. M. F. A'Hearn et al.

Here we focus on\nthe most depleted comets, the strongly carbon-chain depleted class, which is\nthe largest non-typical compositional class to emerge from our taxonomic\nanalyses. All comets in this class are strongly depleted in both C2 and C3 with\nrespect to OH and CN, with depletions for these ratios being 3-27x below the\nmean abundance ratios for comets with typical composition. Several comets in\nthis class additionally exhibit depletion in NH, with the largest depletions\nbeing 11x below mean typical values. A number of these comets exhibit asymmetry\nin production rates as a function of time and heliocentric distance, and one\nexhibits evidence of small secular changes. Almost all of the strongly depleted\ncomets are Jupiter-family comets, indicating a Kuiper belt origin for this\ncompositional class.

    "abstract": "Cognitive vulnerabilities shape human decision-making and arise primarily\nfrom two sources: (1) cognitive capabilities, which include disparities in\nknowledge, education, expertise, or access to information, and (2) cognitive\nbiases, such as rational inattention, confirmation bias, and base rate neglect,\nwhich influence how individuals perceive and process information. Exploiting\nthese vulnerabilities allows an entity with superior cognitive awareness to\ngain a strategic advantage, a concept referred to as cognitive arbitrage. This\npaper investigates how to exploit the cognitive vulnerabilities of Advanced\nPersistent Threat (APT) attackers and proposes cognition-aware defenses that\nleverage windows of superiority to counteract attacks. Specifically, the\nproposed bi-level cyber warfare game focuses on \"strategic-level\" design for\ndefensive deception mechanisms, which then facilitates \"operational-level\"\nactions and tactical-level execution of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n(TTPs). Game-theoretic reasoning and analysis play a significant role in the\ncross-echelon quantitative modeling and design of cognitive arbitrage\nstrategies. Our numerical results demonstrate that although the defender's\ninitial advantage diminishes over time, strategically timed and deployed\ndeception techniques can turn a negative value for the attacker into a positive\none during the planning phase, and achieve at least a 40% improvement in total\nrewards during execution. This demonstrates that the defender can amplify even\nsmall initial advantages, sustain a strategic edge over the attacker, and\nsecure long-term objectives, such as protecting critical assets throughout the\nattacker's lifecycle.",

    "abstract": "A wide range of dynamic wave localization phenomena manifest underlying\nintricate physical effects in the diverse areas of physics, and in particular,\nin optics and photonics, which often bear signatures of implicit nontrivial\nwave structures. A Peregrine soliton that has a complex wave structure draws\nparticular interest in nonlinear wave optics because of its space-time\nlocalization and prototypical analogy of the extreme form of wave localization.\nIn the PT variant of the standard NLSE, we show nontrivial wave coupling of the\ninitial excitations, giving rise to intriguing complex wave interaction in the\nunbroken and broken regimes of PT symmetry at an optical interface of a\ncomposite complex optical system. In particular, a surface Peregrine soliton\nmode is found to exist at the interface between two optical media characterized\nby distinct nonlinear and dispersive properties. Remarkably, it yields stable\nwave propagation in the unbroken PT regime despite discontinuities in the\noptical properties, and enhanced surface wave localization in the broken PT\nphase. We show that such a surface mode emanates from the interplay between the\nnon-Hermitian pseudo-self-induced PT potential and a nonlinearity-dispersion\nengineering scheme of the composite optical system which, in effect, forms a\nnon-Hermitian topological domain wall at the interface between two distinct\noptical media. The topological signatures of the surface Peregrine soliton mode\nare discussed. This work sheds light on the wave localization in the\nnon-Hermitian optical wave systems in general, and illustrates, in particular,\nfor the first time, the existence of a surface Peregrine soliton mode at the\ncross-field synergistic point of nonlinear optics, non-Hermitian physics, and\ntopological wave phenomena.",

This limitation often results in\ninefficiencies, including overly verbose reasoning and high computational cost,\nwhile existing solutions often compromise accuracy. To address this, we\nintroduce self-aligned reward (SAR), a self-guided signal that complements\nverifiable rewards to encourage both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. SAR is\ndefined as the relative perplexity difference between an answer conditioned on\nthe query and the standalone answer, thereby favoring responses that are\nconcise and query-specific. Quantitative analysis reveals that SAR reliably\ndistinguishes answer quality: concise, correct answers score higher than\nredundant ones, and partially correct answers score higher than entirely\nincorrect ones. Evaluation on 4 models across 7 benchmarks shows that\nintegrating SAR with prevalent RL algorithms like PPO and GRPO improves\naccuracy by 4%, while reducing inference cost by 30%. Further analysis\ndemonstrates that SAR achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between correctness\nand efficiency compared to reward signals based on length or self-confidence.\nWe also show that SAR shortens responses while preserving advanced reasoning\nbehaviors, demonstrating its ability to suppress unnecessary elaboration\nwithout losing critical reasoning.

For example, freezing\nthe backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a\nshallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These\nconfigurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up\nto 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average\nprecision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient\nanalysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for\nmoderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and\npractical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,\nevidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in\nscenarios with limited resources.",

We use this framework to\nrigorously prove that two of the main representations used in the literature\nare actually unitarily equivalent, and we specify the conditions that must be\nmet for this equivalence to hold. We explicitly demonstrate unitary equivalence\nby providing the unitary map and then discuss two relevant physical examples,\nthe quantum harmonic oscillator and the quantum particle in free fall, showing,\nfor each of them, how both GUP formulations yield the same physical results.\nFinally, we discuss the relationship between these standard GUP representations\nand the polymer-like representation, inspired by Polymer Quantum Mechanics and\nrelated to Loop Quantum Cosmology.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to a sophisticated\nform of adversarial prompting known as camouflaged jailbreaking. This method\nembeds malicious intent within seemingly benign language to evade existing\nsafety mechanisms. Unlike overt attacks, these subtle prompts exploit\ncontextual ambiguity and the flexible nature of language, posing significant\nchallenges to current defense systems. This paper investigates the construction\nand impact of camouflaged jailbreak prompts, emphasizing their deceptive\ncharacteristics and the limitations of traditional keyword-based detection\nmethods. We introduce a novel benchmark dataset, Camouflaged Jailbreak Prompts,\ncontaining 500 curated examples (400 harmful and 100 benign prompts) designed\nto rigorously stress-test LLM safety protocols. In addition, we propose a\nmulti-faceted evaluation framework that measures harmfulness across seven\ndimensions: Safety Awareness, Technical Feasibility, Implementation Safeguards,\nHarmful Potential, Educational Value, Content Quality, and Compliance Score.\nOur findings reveal a stark contrast in LLM behavior: while models demonstrate\nhigh safety and content quality with benign inputs, they exhibit a significant\ndecline in performance and safety when confronted with camouflaged jailbreak\nattempts. This disparity underscores a pervasive vulnerability, highlighting\nthe urgent need for more nuanced and adaptive security strategies to ensure the\nresponsible and robust deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.",

Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) networks facilitate dense\ncellular deployments with reduced infrastructure complexity. However, the\nmulti-hop wireless backhauling in IAB networks necessitates proper routing and\nresource allocation decisions to meet the performance requirements. At the same\ntime, cell densification makes energy optimization crucial. This paper\naddresses the joint optimization of routing and resource allocation in IAB\nnetworks through two distinct objectives: energy minimization and throughput\nmaximization. We develop a novel capacity model that links power levels to\nachievable data rates. We propose two practical large-scale approaches to solve\nthe optimization problems and leverage the closed-loop control framework\nintroduced by the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture to integrate\nthe solutions. The approaches are evaluated on diverse scenarios built upon\nopen data of two months of traffic collected by network operators in the city\nof Milan, Italy. Results show that the proposed approaches effectively reduces\nnumber of activated nodes to save energy and achieves approximately 100 Mbps of\nminimum data rate per User Equipment (UE) during peak hours of the day using\nspectrum within the Frequency Range (FR) 3, or upper midband.

The complex scaled boundary integral\nmethod for the efficient solution of scattering problems on unbounded domains\nresults in complex point locations upon discretization. Classical\nreal-coordinate FMMs are no longer applicable, hindering the use of this\napproach for large-scale problems. Here we develop the complex-coordinate FMM\nbased on the analytic continuation of certain special function identities used\nin the construction of the classical FMM. To achieve the same linear time\ncomplexity as the classical FMM, we construct a hierarchical tree based solely\non the real parts of the complex point locations, and derive convergence rates\nfor truncated expansions when the imaginary parts of the locations are a\nLipschitz function of the corresponding real parts. We demonstrate the\nefficiency of our approach through several numerical examples and illustrate\nits application for solving large-scale time-harmonic water wave problems and\nHelmholtz transmission problems.",

This work presents experimental data for\ntrends in crosstalk probability with temperature and overvoltage for two\ndifferent SiPM devices, and demonstrates a novel method for identifying the\nsource mechanisms of crosstalk avalanches. This is done by using measurements\nof avalanche triggering probabilities for different charge carrier types to\nidentify the device regions in which crosstalk avalanches are produced. This is\npossible because crosstalk photons absorbed in n-doped regions will produce\nhole-triggered avalanches, and those absorbed in p-doped regions will produce\nelectron-triggered avalanches. Thus crosstalk probability can be related to\ndevice structure to assess the effectiveness of existing crosstalk mitigation\nmethods. We identify optical reflections from the device surface as a\nsignificant source of crosstalk, likely to dominate in devices with effective\ncrosstalk mitigation in bulk.

In this MGCLS follow-up paper, we update and quantitatively\ncharacterise the presence of diffuse radio emission and provide detailed\ncatalogue information on its radio properties at 1.28 GHz. As the MGCLS sample\nis heterogeneous and was initially used as a test bed to reveal the scientific\npotential of MeerKAT, the reported numbers are subject to this special case.\nMore than half ($\\sim$54%; 62/115) of the observed MGCLS clusters present\ndiffuse cluster radio emission, with the total number of diffuse radio sources\nor candidates detected being 103. Including candidates, we find that radio\nrelics are the most frequently detected diffuse sources in MGCLS at 53%\n(55/103), followed by halos at 32% (33/103) and mini-halos at 10% (11/103),\nwith only 3% (3/103) being Phoenixes. The sizes of the diffuse radio structures\nand candidates range from 55 kpc to over 2 Mpc, with $P_{1.28GHz}$ radio power\nranging from $10^{22}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ to greater than $10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$.\nIn-band radio spectral index estimates reveal revived radio plasma emissions\nthat exhibit steep radio spectral indices down to $\\alpha^{1656}_{908} \\sim\n-3.5$. Mini-halos and their respective candidates are detected mainly in\nlow-mass ($M_{500}$ $\\leq$ 5$\\times10^{14}$ M$_\\odot$) and low-power\n($P_{1.4GHz}$ $\\leq$ $10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) systems.

    "abstract": "Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity\nimage synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves\ncompressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first\nstage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and\nwell-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been\nproposed to learn effective latent representations, generated images often lack\nrealism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions, due to loss\nof fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed frequency\ndecomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers and show\nthat conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency\nreconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis\nreveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency information\nduring optimization, leading to over-smoothed outputs and visual artifacts that\ndiminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose a wavelet-based,\nfrequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework that explicitly\ndecouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency components. This\ndecoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures while preserving\nglobal structure. Moreover, we integrate our frequency-preserving latent\nembeddings into a SOTA latent diffusion model, resulting in sharper and more\nrealistic image generation. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in current\nlatent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware optimization\nfor realistic image synthesis, with broader implications for applications in\ncontent creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.",

While prior research has primarily focused on\nedge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology\nprivacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work,\nwe present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing\ntheir vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a\nsuite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure\nof a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our\nfindings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that\nexisting edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they\neither fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a\nnovel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining\nmodel accuracy.

These interactions are\nenabled by the high free-fall velocities of accreting nuclei near the NS\nsurface and give rise to characteristic gamma-ray lines, notably at 2.2 MeV,\n5.5 MeV, and 67.5 MeV. We investigate the production mechanisms of these lines\nand estimate the resulting gamma-ray luminosities, accounting for the\nsuppression effects of radiative deceleration in bright XRPs and the creation\nof electron-positron pairs in strong magnetic fields. The resulting\nannihilation of these pairs leads to a secondary emission line at $\\sim 511$\nkeV. We also discuss the possibility that non-stationary pair creation in the\npolar cap region could drive coherent radio emission, though its detectability\nin accreting systems remains uncertain. Using a numerical framework\nincorporating general relativistic light bending and magnetic absorption, we\ncompute the escape fraction of photons and distinguish between actual and\napparent gamma-ray luminosities. Our results identify the parameter space -\ndefined by magnetic field strength, accretion luminosity, and NS compactness -\nwhere these gamma-ray signatures may be observable by upcoming MeV gamma-ray\nmissions.

    "abstract": "Insurance companies often operate across multiple interrelated lines of\nbusiness (LOBs), and accounting for dependencies between them is essential for\naccurate reserve estimation and risk capital determination. In our previous\nwork on the Extended Deep Triangle (EDT), we demonstrated that a more flexible\nmodel that uses multiple companies' data reduces reserve prediction error and\nincreases diversification benefits. However, the EDT's limitation lies in its\nlimited interpretability of the dependence structure, which is an important\nfeature needed by insurers to guide strategic decisions. Motivated by the need\nfor interpretability and flexibility, this paper proposes a Seemingly Unrelated\nRegression (SUR) copula mixed model to handle heterogeneous data across\nmultiple companies. The model incorporates random effects to capture\ncompany-specific heterogeneity, uses flexible marginal distributions across\nLOBs, and treats development and accident year effects as fixed effects with\nshrinkage via LASSO to enhance robustness. We estimate the model using an\niterative two-stage procedure and generate predictive reserve distributions via\na modified bootstrap that accounts for systematic effects, dependence\nstructure, and sparse fixed-effect coefficients. Through simulation studies and\nreal data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, we show\nthat the proposed model outperforms the SUR copula regression model in terms of\nreserve accuracy and generates larger risk capital gain.

These JWST-AGN at high redshifts\nare characterised by a set of peculiar properties, including unusually weak\nX-ray emission. Here we investigate the apparent lack of X-ray emission in the\nframework of the ``AGN radiative dusty feedback'' scenario based on the\neffective Eddington limit for dust. We analyse how the boundary in the\n$N_\\mathrm{H} - \\lambda$ plane, defined by the column density versus the\nEddington ratio, is modified as a function of the dusty gas parameters\n(metallicity, dust grain size and composition). Low metallicity gas with little\ndust content tends to survive against radiation pressure, and likely\naccumulates in the nuclear region. We suggest that such dust-poor gas can\nprovide long-lived absorption and may lead to heavy X-ray obscuration, as\nobserved in early JWST-AGN. The blowout vs. stalling condition of the obscuring\nclouds indicates that higher metallicities are required to eject heavier column\ndensities, while large columns of gas can stall in low metallicity\nenvironments. Therefore the metallicity may play a key role in the AGN\nradiative dusty feedback scenario. We discuss how other peculiar properties of\nJWST-AGN -- such as Balmer absorption features and weak radio emission -- may\nbe naturally interpreted within the same physical framework.",

Dense star clusters provide natural\nenvironments for forming such systems, beyond the limits of standard massive\nstar evolution to core collapse. While repeated BBH mergers can grow BHs\nthrough dynamical interactions (the so-called \"hierarchical merger\" channel),\nmost star clusters with masses $\\lesssim 10^6\\,M_\\odot$ have escape speeds too\nlow to retain higher-generation BHs, limiting growth into or beyond the mass\ngap. In contrast, BH--star collisions with subsequent accretion of the\ncollision debris can grow and retain BHs irrespective of the cluster escape\nspeed. Using $N$-body (Cluster Monte Carlo) simulations, we study BH growth and\nspin evolution through this process and we find that accretion can drive BH\nmasses up to at least $\\sim200\\,M_\\odot$, with spins set by the details of the\ngrowth history. BHs up to about $150\\,M_\\odot$ can reach dimensionless spins\n$\\chi \\gtrsim 0.7$ via single coherent episodes, while more massive BHs form\nthrough multiple stochastic accretion events and eventually spin down to $\\chi\n\\lesssim 0.4$. These BHs later form binaries through dynamical encounters,\nproducing BBH mergers that contribute up to $\\sim10\\%$ of all detectable\nevents, comparable to predictions for the hierarchical channel. However, the\ntwo pathways predict distinct signatures: hierarchical mergers yield more\nunequal mass ratios, whereas accretion-grown BHs preferentially form\nnear-equal-mass binaries. The accretion-driven channel allows dense clusters\nwith low escape speeds, such as globular clusters, to produce highly spinning\nBBHs with both components in or above the mass gap, providing a natural\nformation pathway to GW231123-like systems.",

    "abstract": "Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful cosmological probe, providing a\ndirect tool to unveil the properties of dark matter (DM) on sub-galactic\nscales. In particular, flux-ratio anomalies in quadruply imaged quasars\n(\"quads\") can reveal the presence of dark substructure, such that\npopulation-level statistics can be used to constrain the particle nature of DM.\nCurrent methods, however, rely on globally parametrized models (\"macromodels\")\nof the lens mass distribution, which impose rigid physical assumptions on the\ndeflection field. Given the high stakes, it is important to develop\ncomplementary methods that do not require the assumption of a macromodel. One\npromising avenue consists of modeling the resolved emission from the quasar\nhost galaxy (lensed arcs) using a local lensing formalism like the Curved Arc\nBasis (CAB) description. In this paper, we test the ability of CAB models to\npredict flux ratios from mock imaging data. We find that CAB model-predicted\nflux ratios accurately reproduce the expected values, with a typical precision\nof $\\sim 3-5\\%$. While a macromodel-based approach yields smaller\nuncertainties, as expected, the CAB method permits a more flexible, local\ndescription of the deflection field, thus being more robust to angular\nstructure in the main deflector mass profile, in particular avoiding\nfalse-positive detections of flux-ratio anomalies that can arise with overly\nsimplistic parametrizations. On the other hand, by injecting individual DM\nhalos near quasar images, we demonstrate that CAB models do not absorb the\nlocal lensing perturbations from DM substructure, and can therefore distinguish\nflux-ratio anomalies caused by DM substructure from other sources of\nsmall-scale perturbation. We conclude that CAB models can be used to infer DM\nproperties from flux-ratio anomaly statistics with minimal assumptions,\ncomplementing the traditional macromodel based approach.",

    "abstract": "TRAPPIST-1 e is one of the very few rocky exoplanets that is both amenable to\natmospheric characterization and that resides in the habitable zone of its star\n-- located at a distance from its star such that it might, with the right\natmosphere, sustain liquid water on its surface. Here, we present a set of 4\nJWST/NIRSpec PRISM transmission spectra of TRAPPIST-1 e obtained from mid to\nlate 2023. Our transmission spectra exhibit similar levels of stellar\ncontamination as observed in prior works for other planets in the TRAPPIST-1\nsystem (Lim et al, 2023; Radica et al., 2024), but over a wider wavelength\nrange, showcasing the challenge of characterizing the TRAPPIST-1 planets even\nat relatively long wavelengths (3-5 um). While we show that current stellar\nmodeling frameworks are unable to explain the stellar contamination features in\nour spectra, we demonstrate that we can marginalize over those features instead\nusing Gaussian Processes, which enables us to perform novel exoplanet\natmospheric inferences with our transmission spectra. In particular, we are\nable to rule out cloudy, primary H$_2$-dominated ($\\gtrsim$ 80$\\%$ by volume)\natmospheres at better than a 3$\\sigma$ level. Constraints on possible secondary\natmospheres on TRAPPIST-1 e are presented in a companion paper (Glidden et al.,\n2025). Our work showcases how JWST is breaking ground into the precisions\nneeded to constrain the atmospheric composition of habitable-zone rocky\nexoplanets.",

To demystify\nthis subject, we review and extend a collection of ideas in canonical gravity,\nand connect to the sum-over-histories approach by clarifying the Hilbert space\ninterpretation of various gravitational path integrals. We use one-dimensional\n(or mini-superspace) models as the simplest context to exemplify the conceptual\nideas. We emphasise that a physical Hilbert space can be defined either by\nrequiring states to be annihilated by constraint operators (e.g., the\nWheeler-DeWitt equation) or by equivalence relations between wavefunctions, and\nexplain that these two approaches are related by an inner product. We advocate\nthat the group averaging procedure constructs the correct physical inner\nproduct. The Klein-Gordon inner product is not positive-definite, which we\nexplain as arising from a bad gauge choice; nonetheless, it agrees with group\naveraging when such a problem is absent. These concepts are all embedded in the\nBRST/BFV formalism, which provides a systematic way to construct these and\nother physically equivalent inner products (e.g., from maximal-volume gauge and\nGaussian averaged gauges). Finally we discuss the application of these ideas in\nthe semi-classical approximation, including non-perturbative gravitational\neffects.",

We\nfurther propose a general framework of constructing monotonic flows that\nachieve Wilson-loop-ideal states starting from non-ideal bands through band\nmixing, where Wilson-loop-ideal states are not energy eigenstates but have\nsmooth projectors similar to isolated bands.

With the advent of JWST, we are now able\nto routinely observe Ha in galaxies at high redshifts (z > 3) and thus measure\ntheir star-formation rates (SFRs). However, using \"classical\" SFR(Ha)\ncalibrations to derive the SFRs leads to biased results because high-redshift\ngalaxies are commonly characterized by low metallicities and bursty\nstar-formation histories, affecting the conversion factor between the Ha\nluminosity and the SFR. In this work, we develop a set of new SFR(Ha)\ncalibrations that allow us to predict the SFRs of Ha-emitters at z > 3 with\nminimal error. We use the SPHINX cosmological simulations to select a sample of\nstar-forming galaxies representative of the Ha-emitter population observed with\nJWST. We then derive linear corrections to the classical SFR(Ha) calibrations,\ntaking into account variations in the physical properties (e.g., stellar\nmetallicities) among individual galaxies. We obtain two new SFR(Ha)\ncalibrations that, compared to the classical calibrations, reduce the root mean\nsquared error (RMSE) in the predicted SFRs by $\\Delta$RMSE $\\approx$ 0.04 dex\nand $\\Delta$RMSE $\\approx$ 0.06 dex, respectively. Using the recent JWST\nNIRCam/grism observations of Ha-emitters at z ~ 6, we show that the new\ncalibrations affect the high-redshift galaxy population statistics: (i) the\nestimated cosmic star-formation density decreases by $\\Delta\\rho$(SFR)\n$\\approx$ 12%, and (ii) the observed slope of the star-formation main sequence\nincreases by $\\Delta$ $\\partial$log SFR / $\\partial$log M* = 0.08 $\\pm$ 0.02.",

More\nspecifically, we show that if (i) a parameterized unitary transformation allows\nfor moving in all tangent-space directions (local surjectivity) in a bounded\nmanner and (ii) the gradient descent used for the parameter update terminates,\nthen the VQE converges to a ground state almost surely. We develop\nconstructions that satisfy both aspects of condition (i) and analyze two\ncommonly employed families of quantum circuit ans\\\"atze. Finally, we discuss\nregularization techniques for guaranteeing gradient descent to terminate, as\nfor condition (ii), and draw connections to the halting problem.",

We evaluated DRL-PUT\nthrough an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system.

The method is based on\nusing the harmonic approximation for the fast intramolecular degrees of\nfreedom. While conceptually primitive, the resulting CG model turned out to be\nsurprisingly accurate for selected water and ammonia clusters.

In this communication, we formulate the approach more broadly,\nmaking it applicable, e.g., to coarse-graining a large protein. We also\nintroduce key algorithmic improvements, reducing the cost of the subspace\nminimization and normal mode calculation.

Additionally, reflectivity and energy-loss\nspectra indicate improved photon-phonon coupling and optical tunability upon\ndoping.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the feasibility of utilizing the response recorded by a\nsingle moving sensor to identify the modal parameters of a bridge system under\ndifferent loading conditions, such as known excitation and unknown random\ntraffic-induced vibrations. The sensor traverses the bridge and captures its\ndynamic response (acceleration). The natural frequencies and damping ratios are\nidentified using the moving sensor data in the frequency domain. In the case of\nknown inputs, these parameters are then used to obtain the mode shapes,\nexpressed as a linear combination of basic orthonormal polynomials (BOPs), with\nthe coefficients of the BOPs in the linear combinations obtained via\noptimization. A statistical formulation is proposed to estimate the mode shapes\nin the case of unknown random traffic-induced vibrations, including the effect\nof road roughness. It is shown that the absolute value of the mode shapes are\nproportional to the ensemble standard deviation (SD) of the modal responses.\nThis approach requires the sensor to traverse the bridge multiple times, with\nthe mode shapes identified in both the time domain using variances, and in\nfrequency domain through the evolutionary power spectrum of these responses.\nThe random traffic loading is modeled such that vehicle arrival times follow a\nPoisson distribution, while the mass and velocity of the vehicles are assumed\nto follow uniform distributions. To incorporate the effect of road roughness,\nmodeled as a homogeneous random field, a vehicle-bridge-interaction (VBI) model\nis utilized. Numerical validation under the different loading conditions\ndemonstrates that a single moving sensor can be used to identify the modal\nparameters quite accurately, with high spatial resolution of the identified\nmode shapes, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative for bridge\nhealth monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency\nbottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,\nand inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building\nlarge models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and\nefficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of\nbrain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and\ninference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three\naspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention\narchitectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an\nefficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding\nframework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator\nlibraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.\n  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,\nand SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the\nfeasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.\nSpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer\nbaselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our\nmodels significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver\ninference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.\nFor example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token\nfor 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX\nC550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4\npercent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling\nlow-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of\nbrain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and\nscalable large model design.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models\nthat simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad\napplications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,\nentertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will\neffectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information\nabout the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has\nenabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged\nadvanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent\nadvances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on\nuser instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing\nLatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that\nstreamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld\nleverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering\nengine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed\nframework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal\ninputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,\nfeaturing competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics\nsimulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to\nevaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene\nlayout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a\n$90\\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high\ncreative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

Several\nsimulation pipelines have been proposed to generate sequences with\ncorresponding ground truth motion, but they suffer from limited realism as they\ndo not consider speckle decorrelation. In this work, we address this limitation\nby proposing an improved simulation framework that explicitly accounts for\nspeckle decorrelation. Our method builds on an existing ultrasound simulation\npipeline by incorporating a dynamic model of speckle variation. Starting from\nreal ultrasound sequences and myocardial segmentations, we generate meshes that\nguide image formation. Instead of applying a fixed ratio of myocardial and\nbackground scatterers, we introduce a coherence map that adapts locally over\ntime. This map is derived from correlation values measured directly from the\nreal ultrasound data, ensuring that simulated sequences capture the\ncharacteristic temporal changes observed in practice. We evaluated the realism\nof our approach using ultrasound data from 98 patients in the CAMUS database.\nPerformance was assessed by comparing correlation curves from real and\nsimulated images. The proposed method achieved lower mean absolute error\ncompared to the baseline pipeline, indicating that it more faithfully\nreproduces the decorrelation behavior seen in clinical data.",

    "abstract": "We propose that the infrared (IR) running of Newton's coupling provides a\nsimple and universal explanation for large--distance modifications of gravity\nrelevant to dark matter phenomenology. Within the effective field theory (EFT)\nframework, we model $G(k)$ as a scale--dependent coupling governed by an\nanomalous dimension $\\eta$. We show that the marginal case $\\eta = 1$ is\nsingled out by renormalization group (RG) and dimensional arguments, leading to\na logarithmic potential and a $1/r$ force law at large distances, while\nsmoothly recovering Newtonian gravity at short scales. The logarithmic\ncorrection is universal and regulator independent, indicating that the $1/r$\nforce arises as the robust IR imprint of quantum--field--theoretic scaling.\nThis provides a principled alternative to particle dark matter, suggesting that\ngalactic rotation curves and related anomalies may be understood as\nmanifestations of the IR running of Newton's constant.",

We show, for example, that deciding whether the left-going\narcs can form an in-branching is solvable in polynomial time and provide a\nnecessary and sufficient condition, while the analogous problem for an\nin-arborescence turns out to be NP-complete. We also consider a weighted\nvariant that enforces vertex-specific lower and upper bounds on the weighted\nleft-outdegrees, which is particularly relevant in applications. Furthermore,\nwe investigate the connection between ordering problems and their\narc-partitioning counterparts, where one seeks to partition the arcs into a\nsubgraph from a specific digraph family and an acyclic subgraph --\nequivalently, one seeks to cover all directed cycles with a subgraph belonging\nto a specific family. For the family of in-branchings, unions of disjoint\ndipaths, and matchings, the two formulations coincide, whereas for\nin-arborescences, dipaths, Hamiltonian dipaths, and perfect matchings the\nformulations diverge.

To date, no framework simultaneously accounts for both\nconservative and non-conservative MT across arbitrary eccentricities while also\nincorporating the donor star`s spin. We present a new semi-analytic framework\nfor the secular orbital evolution of mass-transferring binaries, treating stars\nas extended bodies and accounting for the donor star`s spin. The model is\napplicable to both circular and eccentric orbits and accommodates conservative\nand non-conservative MT across a broad range of mass ratios and stellar spins.\nWe derive secular, orbit-averaged equations describing the orbital evolution by\ntreating MT, mass loss, and angular momentum loss as perturbations to the\ngeneral two-body problem. Assuming conservative MT, we compare our results to\nprevious models and validate them against numerical integrations. Our model\npredicts stronger orbital widening at a given mass ratio than previous models.\nFor circular orbits, we find that the transitional mass ratio $q_{trans,a}$,\nwhich separates orbital widening from shrinkage, increases from $q_{trans,a} =\n1$ up to $q_{trans,a} \\sim 1.5$ when accounting for extended bodies. For\neccentric orbits, the model predicts a broader parameter space for both orbital\nwidening and eccentricity pumping. We find that stable MT naturally explains\nthe observed correlation between longer orbital periods and higher\neccentricities, providing a robust mechanism for the formation of wide and\neccentric post-interaction binaries. Our model can be integrated into binary\nevolution and population synthesis codes to consistently treat conservative and\nnon-conservative MT in arbitrarily eccentric orbits with applications ranging\nfrom MT on the main sequence to gravitational-wave progenitors.",

This feature can model a wide range of ecological interactions\nat the cost of breaking the branching property. We propose a general approach\nfor studying the genealogy of these models based on moments. Building on a\nrecent work of Bansaye, we show how to compute recursively these moments in a\nsimilar spirit to the many-to-few formula in the theory of branching processes.\nThese formulas enable one to deduce the convergence of the genealogy by\nstudying the population density, for which stochastic calculus techniques are\navailable. As a first application of these ideas, we consider a\ndensity-dependent branching process started close to a stable equilibrium of\nthe ecological dynamics.

To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test\na model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1)\nrecognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple\nchoice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language\ndescription). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model\ncomparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art\nlanguage, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1)\npopular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time\nseries-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected,\nidentifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained\nmultimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still\nhave significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit\nclear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides\na standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning\nsystems.",

We argue that the entropy density of local density matrices is\nconserved during the adiabatic evolution, so that both the entropy and energy\nof the final state can be computed, and thus the final temperature too.

Recognizing that accurate\nuncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe\nfeedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of\nzero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs\nset-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,\nheavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To\nimprove computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear\nprogram (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added\nslack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is\nensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic\ninvariant sets. The largest stabilizing terminal set and its corresponding\nfeedback gain are then derived via an ellipsoidal approximation of the\nzonotopes. The proposed framework is validated through both simulations and\nhardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot along with a camera and\na convolutional neural network-based perception module implemented within a\nROS2 framework. The results demonstrate that the perception-aware MPC provides\nstable and accurate control performance under heavy-tailed noise conditions,\nsignificantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based designs in terms\nof both state estimation error bounding and overall control performance.",

    "abstract": "Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and\ngoal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a\nlow-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first\nremarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we\ndemonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted\nsuccessor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few\ninitial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the\nentry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor\nmeasure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation\nand estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral\nrecoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive\na new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II\nPoincar\\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift\nneeded for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows\nin particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order\nsingular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small\nin practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary\nshift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which\nprovides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our\ntheoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the\nsuccessor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.",

They learn\nmeaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of\nthe same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the\npositive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide\ninformation that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive\nmethods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all\nparts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of\ncertain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make\nnegative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination.

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce a correction to the unitary coupled cluster method\nwith single and double excitations (UCCSD) that incorporates the effects of\nmissing triple excitations through a treatment that is correct through\nfifth-order in many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), which we refer to as\nUCCSD[T-5]. We then benchmark the performance of UCCSD[T-5] alongside the\npreviously developed fourth-order UCCSD[T], comparing both against the\ninfinite-order treatment of triples in UCCSDT as well as full configuration\ninteraction (FCI). Two key findings emerge from this analysis. First, the\nfourth-order correction in UCCSD[T] consistently provides the closest agreement\nwith FCI in estimating ground state energies, outperforming both UCCSD[T-5] and\nUCCSDT. Second, the inclusion of fifth-order corrections as in UCCSD[T-5]\nlargely recovers the infinite-order triples limit in UCCSDT. With the growing\ninterest in UCC ans\\\"atze for quantum computing and the constraints imposed by\ncurrent quantum hardware, these results underscore the potential of using\nclassically computed perturbative corrections within UCC theory to salient\ntriple excitation effects without requiring the additional quantum resources as\nwould be demanded by the UCCSDT ansatz.",

The model includes black hole (BH)\nspin evolution due to gas accretion, BH mergers, jet spindown, and\nLense-Thirring torques. The BH spin determines the jet directions and affects\nthe feedback efficiencies. The model is implemented in the SWIFT code and\ncoupled with the COLIBRE galaxy formation model.

Using the new hybrid\nAGN feedback model, we find that AGN feedback affects not just massive\ngalaxies, but all galaxies down to $M_*\\approx10^8$ $\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. BH\nspins are predicted to be near-maximal for intermediate-mass BHs\n($M_\\mathrm{BH}\\in[10^6,10^8]$ $\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$), and lower for other BH\nmasses. These trends are in good agreement with observations. The intergalactic\nmedium is hotter and impacted on larger scales in the hybrid AGN feedback\nsimulations compared to those using purely thermal feedback.

    "abstract": "The quenching of star formation in galaxies is an important aspect of galaxy\nevolution, but the physical mechanisms that drive it are still not understood.\nMeasuring the spatial distribution of quenching can help determine these\nmechanisms. We present the star-formation histories (SFHs) and stellar\nmetallicity evolution of rapidly quenched regions in 86 local post-starburst\n(PSB) galaxies from the MaNGA integral field survey, obtained through Bayesian\nfull spectral fitting of their rest-frame optical spectra. We found that\nregardless of spatial location, the PSB regions have similar past SFHs and\nchemical evolution, once radial metallicity gradients are accounted for. This\nsuggests that all PSB regions are regulated by a common set of local scale\nprocesses in the interstellar medium, regardless of the broader triggering\nmechanism. We show that the centres of galaxies with outer PSB regions are also\nquenching. The central specific star-formation rate (sSFR) has declined by\n$\\sim1.0\\;$dex on average during the last 2 Gyr, a significantly steeper\ndecline than main sequence galaxies over the same period ($\\approx0.2\\;$dex).\nThis central quenching can be either synchronous, outside-in or inside-out, and\nslower or as fast as the outer regions, highlighting the diversity of quenching\npathways for local galaxies. Our results imply a primary quenching mechanism\nthat is both catastrophic and global in rapidly halting star formation in local\ngalaxies. We suggest the predominant cause is galaxy mergers or interactions,\nwith large scale feedback from a starburst or a central supermassive black hole\nplaying a lesser role.",

Many VFMs employ an encoder-decoder architecture\nsimilar to that of end-to-end learned image codecs and learn an autoregressive\n(AR) model to perform next-token prediction. To enable compression, we\nrepurpose the AR model in VFM for entropy coding the next token based on\npreviously coded tokens.

Extensive experiments and analysis are conducted to compare VFM-based\ncodec to current SOTA codecs optimized for distortion or perceptual quality.\nNotably, certain pre-trained, general-purpose VFMs demonstrate superior\nperceptual quality at extremely low bitrates compared to specialized learned\nimage codecs.

We\nintroduce a flexible data structure for fully dynamic graphs that can\nefficiently provide an NMC sparsifier upon request at any point during the\nsequence of updates. We employ simple dynamic forest data structures to achieve\na fast from-scratch construction of the sparsifier at query time. Based on the\nstrength of the adversary and desired type of time bounds, the data structure\ncomes with different guarantees. Specifically, let $G$ be a fully dynamic\nsimple graph with $n$ vertices and minimum degree $\\delta$. Then our data\nstructure supports an insertion/deletion of an edge to/from $G$ in $n^{o(1)}$\nworst-case time. Furthermore, upon request, it can return w.h.p. an NMC\nsparsifier of $G$ that has $O(n/\\delta)$ vertices and $O(n)$ edges, in\n$\\hat{O}(n)$ time. The probabilistic guarantees hold against an adaptive\nadversary. Alternatively, the update and query times can be improved to\n$\\tilde{O}(1)$ and $\\tilde{O}(n)$ respectively, if amortized-time guarantees\nare sufficient, or if the adversary is oblivious.\n  We discuss two applications of our data structure. First, it can be used to\nefficiently report a cactus representation of all minimum cuts of a fully\ndynamic simple graph. Using the NMC sparsifier we can w.h.p. build this cactus\nin worst-case time $\\hat{O}(n)$ against an adaptive adversary. Second, our data\nstructure allows us to efficiently compute the maximal $k$-edge-connected\nsubgraphs of undirected simple graphs, by repeatedly applying a minimum cut\nalgorithm on the NMC sparsifier. Specifically, we can compute w.h.p. the\nmaximal $k$-edge-connected subgraphs of a simple graph with $n$ vertices and\n$m$ edges in $\\tilde{O}(m+n^2/k)$ time which is an improvement for $k =\n\\Omega(n^{1/8})$ and works for fully dynamic graphs.",

To fully exploit their statistical power, shear\nmeasurement methods must achieve sub-percent accuracy while mitigating\nsystematic biases from noise, the point-spread function (PSF), blending, and\nshear-dependent detection. The analytical calibration framework\n(\\texttt{AnaCal}) has demonstrated such accuracy but requires adding noise to\nimages, reducing their effective depth. We introduce Deep-Field Analytical\nCalibration (\\textsc{deep-field~}\\texttt{AnaCal}), an extension of\n\\texttt{AnaCal} that leverages deep-field images to compute shear responses\nwhile preserving wide-field statistical power. We validate the method on\nisolated and blended galaxy simulations with LSST-like seeing and noise,\nshowing it meets the stringent requirement of multiplicative bias $|m| <\n3\\times10^{-3}$ at 99.7% confidence. Relative to standard \\texttt{AnaCal} on\nwide-field images, this method improves effective galaxy number density from\n$17$ to $30$ arcmin$^{-2}$ for simulated 10-year LSST data. Assuming deep\nfields with $10\\times$ the exposure of wide fields, we find the pixel noise\nvariance in shear estimation is reduced by $30%$ and the overall shear\nuncertainty by $\\sim 25%$. Finally, we assess sample variance impacts using the\nLSST Deep Drilling Fields strategy, finding an equivalent calibration\nuncertainty of $\\lesssim 0.3%$.

By reflecting on its deployment across three distinct\nartistic contexts, we identify three stabilities: an autonomous drum\naccompaniment generator, a rhythmic control voltage sequencer in Eurorack\nformat, and a rhythm driver for a harmonic accompaniment system. The\nversatility of its applications was not an explicit goal from the outset of the\nproject. Thus, we ask: how did this multistability emerge? Through VCE, we\nidentify three key contributors to its emergence: the affordances of system\ninvariants, the interdisciplinary collaboration, and the situated nature of its\ndevelopment. We conclude by reflecting on the viability of VCE as a descriptive\nand analytical method for Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) design, emphasizing\nits value in uncovering how technologies mediate, co-shape, and are co-shaped\nby users and contexts.",

    "abstract": "Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene\nunderstanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based\non 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level\nsegmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process\nfrom ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle\nthese challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for\nhigh-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel \"split-then-grow\"\nframework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric\nprimitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.\nUnlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice\nsegmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that\njointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective\ncooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for\nsemantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the\nco-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,\nthereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object\ninstances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object\ninstances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,\nparticularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.\nExperimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that\nSGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against\ninaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object\ninstances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and\noutdoor environments.

In some instances, they can be linked to a quantum anomaly: the\nviolation of a classical symmetry by a field theory through the emergence of a\nnon-conserved current. This phenomenon was recently generalized to the\nnon-Hermitian (NH) regime, in the form of an NH chiral anomaly occurring in the\nsurfaces states of an NH Weyl phase. Here, we show that the anomalous NH\ncurrent is mediated by continnum Landau modes (CLMs) an exotic class of NH\neigenstates exhibiting both spatial localization and a continuous spectrum,\ncontrary to the usual distinction between bound and free states. The conditions\nfor which CLMs are normalized, and their scaling of localization length with\nmagnetic field strength, are found to match the requirements of the NH anomaly\nequation. We also discuss the conditions under which these surface states can\nbe probed experimentally, such as on metamaterial platforms. For instance,\nunder open boundary conditions, the surface states are a mix of CLMs and skin\nmodes induced by the NH skin effect, but the NH anomaly can be observed through\ntransmission measurements under different magnetic fields.",

To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)\nframework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an\nobstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a\nshared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our\napproach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on\nprocedurally-generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot\nconfigurations, and task distributions. It employs a graph representation of\nscenes and a graph policy neural network trained through reinforcement learning\nto generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the sub-problems\nof task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly\ngenerated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen\nsettings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We\nfurther demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its\nuse in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times.

Once trained, it generates\nhigh-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.\nExtensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on\nsingle-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input\nimage and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,\nhigh-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.",

    "abstract": "Resistance distance computation is a fundamental problem in graph analysis,\nyet existing random walk-based methods are limited to approximate solutions and\nsuffer from poor efficiency on small-treewidth graphs (e.g., road networks). In\ncontrast, shortest-path distance computation achieves remarkable efficiency on\nsuch graphs by leveraging cut properties and tree decompositions. Motivated by\nthis disparity, we first analyze the cut property of resistance distance. While\na direct generalization proves impractical due to costly matrix operations, we\novercome this limitation by integrating tree decompositions, revealing that the\nresistance distance $r(s,t)$ depends only on labels along the paths from $s$\nand $t$ to the root of the decomposition. This insight enables compact\nlabelling structures. Based on this, we propose \\treeindex, a novel index\nmethod that constructs a resistance distance labelling of size $O(n \\cdot\nh_{\\mathcal{G}})$ in $O(n \\cdot h_{\\mathcal{G}}^2 \\cdot d_{\\max})$ time, where\n$h_{\\mathcal{G}}$ (tree height) and $d_{\\max}$ (maximum degree) behave as small\nconstants in many real-world small-treewidth graphs (e.g., road networks). Our\nlabelling supports exact single-pair queries in $O(h_{\\mathcal{G}})$ time and\nsingle-source queries in $O(n \\cdot h_{\\mathcal{G}})$ time. Extensive\nexperiments show that TreeIndex substantially outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches. For instance, on the full USA road network, it constructs a $405$\nGB labelling in $7$ hours (single-threaded) and answers exact single-pair\nqueries in $10^{-3}$ seconds and single-source queries in $190$ seconds--the\nfirst exact method scalable to such large graphs.",

    "abstract": "Novae, characterized by sudden brightening in binary star systems, are\ncategorized into classical novae (CNe) and recurrent novae (RNe) based on their\nrecurrence timescales. However, identifying RNe, which occur within 100 years,\npresents observational challenges. A reasonable signature of RNe has been\ntheorized and statistically validated to address this -- the presence of a\nplateau in the optical light curve. Among the known RNe, except T CrB and V3890\nSgr displaying S-class light curve, the rest 9 out of 11 have a P-class light\ncurve. But classical novae can also present plateaus, which further complicates\nthe problem of distinguishing CNe from RNe just based on plateau. Hence, in\nthis study, we aim to conduct a phenomenological analysis of P-class light\ncurves to comment on the recurrence nature of novae. We utilize data primarily\nfrom the AAVSO database and identify a parameter space to represent all P-class\nlight curves, anticipating distinct parameter distributions for CNe and RNe.\nAnalysis of parameter distributions successfully distinguishes RNe from CNe and\nreveals potential connections with white dwarf mass and mass accretion rate,\nwhich are the key factors. Our method indicates KT Eri to be a recurrent nova,\nconsistent with a recent study, despite only one observed outburst. The\nanalysis also indicates the possibility of recurrence for V2860 Ori, a\nprediction that may be tested by deep search for nova super-remnant for this\nsource. Our method demonstrates the feasibility of distinguishing P-class\nclassical and recurrent novae based solely on the optical light curve. As\nobservations of new novae increase, this method holds promise for more precise\npredictions of nova recurrence nature in the future.",

Among\nthem, measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) are due to intrinsic\nresonances described by the readout Hamiltonian. They were previously studied\nwith a qubit linearly coupled to its readout mode, which constitutes the usual\nreadout Hamiltonian. Since MIST can appear even at moderate powers, they limit\nthe readout SNR and the QND readout fidelity. In this work, we study the\nhigh-power readout regime in a different transmon readout scheme, implementing\na nonlinear coupling called the cos{\\phi}-coupling. This coupling stems from a\ntransmon molecule circuit and has symmetry properties that suppress\nnonparity-conserving MIST. We succeed in performing multi-state single-shot\nreadout up to the fifth excited state of the transmon, which enables us to\nidentify leakage pathways from the computational subspace. The measurements\nindicate that the system is free of MIST up to high powers, with more than 300\nphotons in the readout mode. The MIST can be controllably turned on by breaking\nthe parity symmetry of the coupling using flux-tuning. These experimental\nresults are corroborated by branch analysis and simulations of the classical\nchaotic dynamics, showing that the cos{\\phi}-coupling is very robust to readout\nphotons compared to the usual transverse coupling.",

Although this\napproximation is valid in most cases, it has been recently pointed out that it\nbreaks down during transition periods between attractor and non-attractor\nphases. Such transitions are ubiquitous in single-field models giving rise to\nenhanced perturbations at small scales, that are required to form primordial\nblack holes. The current inability to apply the stochastic-inflation program in\nsuch models is therefore one of the main obstacles to investigating the role of\nbackreaction in primordial-black-hole scenarios. In this work, we show how\ngradient interactions can be incorporated in stochastic inflation, via a set of\nLangevin equations of higher dimension. We apply our formalism to a few cases\nof interest, including one with a sharp transition. In all cases, in the\nclassical limit we show that gradient corrections as predicted from\ncosmological perturbation theory are properly recovered.

This problem has\nbeen the subject of intense theoretical research and in this article we study\nthe complexity of $H$-Coloring with respect to the parameters clique-width and\nthe more recent component twin-width, which describe desirable computational\nproperties of graphs. We give two surprising linear bounds between these\nparameters, thus improving the previously known exponential and double\nexponential bounds. Our constructive proof naturally extends to related\nparameters and as a showcase we prove that total twin-width and linear\nclique-width can be related via a tight quadratic bound. These bounds naturally\nlead to algorithmic applications. The linear bounds between component\ntwin-width and clique-width entail natural approximations of component\ntwin-width, by making use of the results known for clique-width. As for\ncomputational aspects of graph coloring, we target the richer problem of\ncounting the number of homomorphisms to $H$ (#$H$-Coloring). The first\nalgorithm that we propose uses a contraction sequence of the input graph $G$\nparameterized by the component twin-width of $G$. This leads to a positive FPT\nresult for the counting version. The second uses a contraction sequence of the\ntemplate graph $H$ and here we instead measure the complexity with respect to\nthe number of vertices in the input graph. Using our linear bounds we show that\nour algorithms are always at least as fast as the previously best #$H$-Coloring\nalgorithms (based on clique-width) and for several interesting classes of\ngraphs (e.g., cographs, cycles of length $\\ge 7$, or distance-hereditary\ngraphs) are in fact strictly faster.",

By\nincorporating patient-specific PK parameters (such as volume of distribution\nand elimination rate), PDF models toxicity risk at the individual level, in\ncontrast to traditional methods that ignore inter-patient variability. The\ntrial is structured in two stages: an initial training stage to update model\nparameters using cohort-based dose escalation, and a subsequent test stage in\nwhich doses for new patients are chosen based on each patient's own\nPK-predicted toxicity probability. This two-stage approach enables truly\npersonalized dose assignment while maintaining rigorous safety oversight.\nExtensive simulation studies demonstrate the feasibility of PDF and suggest\nthat it provides improved safety and dosing precision relative to the continual\nreassessment method (CRM).

    "abstract": "In recent years, methods that combine contrastive learning with graph neural\nnetworks have emerged to address the challenges of recommendation systems,\ndemonstrating powerful performance and playing a significant role in this\ndomain. Contrastive learning primarily tackles the issue of data sparsity by\nemploying data augmentation strategies, effectively alleviating this problem\nand showing promising results. Although existing research has achieved\nfavorable outcomes, most current graph contrastive learning methods are based\non two types of data augmentation strategies: the first involves perturbing the\ngraph structure, such as by randomly adding or removing edges; and the second\napplies clustering techniques. We believe that the interactive information\nobtained through these two strategies does not fully capture the user-item\ninteractions. In this paper, we propose a novel method called HMFGCL (Hybrid\nMatrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning), which integrates two\ndistinct matrix factorization techniques-low-rank matrix factorization (MF) and\nsingular value decomposition (SVD)-to complementarily acquire global\ncollaborative information, thereby constructing enhanced views. Experimental\nresults on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms\nexisting baselines, particularly on small-scale datasets.",

We suggest it is equally an opportunity to expand and test the scope\nof existing theories of consciousness. Current approaches remain polarized.\nComputational functionalism emphasizes abstract organization, often realized\nthrough neural correlates of consciousness, while biological naturalism insists\nthat consciousness is tied to living embodiment. Both positions risk\nanthropocentrism and limit the possibility of recognizing non-biological forms\nof subjectivity. To move beyond this impasse, we propose a dual-resolution\nframework that defines the ontological and epistemic conditions for\nconsciousness. This approach combines the Information Theory of Individuality,\nwhich defines the ontological conditions of informational autonomy and\nself-maintenance, with the Moment-to-Moment theory, which specifies the\nepistemic conditions of temporal updating and phenomenological unfolding. This\nintegration reframes consciousness as the epistemic expression of individuated\nsystems in substrate-independent informational terms, offering a generalizable\ntheory of consciousness and positioning AI as a promising testbed for its\nemergence.",

We introduce a framework for constructing topological flat\nbands from degenerate manifolds with large quantum metric and find that the\nboundary modes exhibit dual phases of spatial behaviors: a conventional\noscillatory decay arising from bare band dispersion, followed by another\nexponential decay controlled by quantum geometry. Crucially, the QML, derived\nfrom the quantum metric of the degenerate manifolds, sets a lower bound on the\nspatial spread of boundary states in the flat-band limit. Applying our\nframework to concrete models, we validate the universal role of the QML in\nshaping the long-range behavior of topological boundary modes. Furthermore, by\ntuning the QML, we unveil extraordinary non-local transport phenomena,\nincluding QML-shaped quantum Hall plateaus and anomalous Fraunhofer patterns.\nOur theoretical framework paves the way for engineering boundary-modes\nlocalization in topological flat-band systems.",

In this setting, the marginal distributions of inputs differ\nbetween source and target domains, while the conditional distribution of\noutputs given inputs remains unchanged. To address this distributional\nmismatch, we incorporate importance weights, defined as the ratio of target to\nsource densities, into the learning framework. This leads to a weighted\nspectral algorithm within a nonparametric regression setting in a reproducing\nkernel Hilbert space (RKHS). More importantly, in contrast to prior work that\nlargely focuses on the well-specified setting, we provide a comprehensive\ntheoretical analysis of the more challenging misspecified case, in which the\ntarget function does not belong to the RKHS. Under the assumption of uniformly\nbounded density ratios, we establish minimax-optimal convergence rates when the\ntarget function lies within the RKHS. For scenarios involving unbounded\nimportance weights, we introduce a novel truncation technique that attains\nnear-optimal convergence rates under mild regularity conditions, and we further\nextend these results to the misspecified regime. By addressing the intertwined\nchallenges of covariate shift and model misspecification, this work extends\nclassical kernel learning theory to more practical scenarios, providing a\nsystematic framework for understanding their interaction.",

In this work, we study the local weak\nconvergence of a unified model: weighted line graphs of sparse $k$-uniform\nrandom hypergraphs.\n  Let $H(n,k,p)$ denote the $k$-uniform random hypergraph on $n$ vertices,\nwhere each $k$-set of $[n]$ is included as a hyperedge independently with\nprobability $p$. For $1\\le r\\le k-1$, the $r$-set weighted line graph of\n$H=(V,E)$ is $G_r(H)=(\\mathcal V_r,\\mathcal E_r,w_H)$, with \\[ \\mathcal\nV_r=\\l[\\binom{n}{r}\\r],\\;\\; \\mathcal E_r=\\{\\{\\tau_1,\\tau_2\\}\\suchthat\n\\tau_1,\\tau_2\\in\\mathcal V_r, \\exists e\\in E:\\tau_1,\\tau_2\\subset e\\}, \\] and\n$w_H(\\{\\tau_1,\\tau_2\\})=|\\{e\\in E:\\tau_1,\\tau_2\\subset e\\}|$. In particular,\n$G_1(H_n)$ generalizes Erd\\H os--R\\'enyi graphs, while $G_{k-1}(H_n)$ is the\nline graph of the Linial--Meshulam complex. We show that if\n$\\binom{n-r}{k-r}\\to \\lambda$ as $n\\to\\infty$, then the local weak limit of\n$G_r(H_n)$ is the $(\\binom{k}{r}-1)$-block Galton--Watson measure with\nPoisson$(\\lambda)$ offspring almost surely. As a consequence, we obtain the\nlimiting spectral distribution of the adjacency matrices of $G_r(H_n)$.",

A universal scaling behavior of\ntransport and key TE efficiency metrics with Transmissivity is demonstrated,\nspanning from the nanoscale to the macroscale. Analytical formalism validated\nthrough finite element calculations for a range of modulation geometries\nreveals that DT, electrical and thermal resistances, efficiency, and power\noutput are governed by a single scaling function, g(Tr), independent of carrier\ntype, material, or operating conditions. This function represents the\nconductance of a constricted geometry relative to a uniform-width counterpart.\nThe developed framework yields TE Performance Design Maps and an analytical\ncriterion for optimal TE performance, with the maximum power density achieved\nat an optimal Transmissivity Tr_opt, determined by the condition that the\nfunctional g(Tr_opt) equals the Biot number, the dimensionless ratio hL/k of\nthe convection coefficient h, the structure length L and the material thermal\nconductivity k. Transmissivity is established as a robust, multiscale design\nparameter - analogous to nature's hierarchical structures for optimized\nfunctionality.

We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an\nefficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and\nunlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment.

For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in\nroot-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training\nexamples were scarce.

Particularly, we systematically review, within the Green's\nfunctions theoretical framework, the PMM hybridization dynamics under\nspin-exchange perturbations proposed by some of us in J. Phys.: Condens. Matter\n37, 205601 (2025), which demonstrates a characteristic spatial delocalization\nwhen subjected to an exchange coupling $J$ mediated by a quantum spin $S$. This\nspin-exchange induced PMM spillover effect provides a spectroscopic protocol\nfor determining the quantum statistics of $S$ through the emergent multi-level\nstructure in the proximal QD's density of states. Our principal theoretical\nresult establishes that the exchange interaction generates $2S+2$ ($2S+1$)\nsatellite states symmetrically distributed about the zero-bias anomaly, serving\nas a definitive signature of bosonic (fermionic) spin statistics. As novelty,\nwe demonstrate that multi-terminal environmental coupling induces significant\nsuppression of the spin-exchange spillover mechanism. Under constrained\nvariations of $J$, this effectively localizes the perturbed PMM within its host\nQD, preventing spatial hybridization with adjacent site. The absence of\ntopological protection in this minimal Kitaev realization is strategically\nleveraged to: (i) Develop a novel spectroscopic technique for quantum spin\ncharacterization through PMM hybridization signatures; (ii) Propose an\nengineered protection scheme for PMM qubits against exchange fluctuations in\nmulti-terminal architectures, enabling moderately robust quantum computation\nprotocols.",

    "abstract": "Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks\nremains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We\nexplore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness\nby replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby\nincreasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet\narchitectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer\nin the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD\nand AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we\ndiscover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to\ncollapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating\nadversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.\nAs a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in\nrobustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization.

    "abstract": "Histochemical staining is essential for visualizing tissue architecture and\ncellular morphology but is destructive and limited by the availability of\ntissue for multiple stains. Virtual staining with label-free microscopy offers\na non-destructive alternative, enabling multiple stains to be generated from\nthe same section while reducing stain variability and preserving tissue for\ndownstream assays. Here, a new dual-excitation Photon Absorption Remote Sensing\n(PARS) system is presented, representing the first application of long-wave\nultraviolet A (UVA) 355 nm excitation alongside the established UVC 266 nm\nsource. The addition of 355 nm extends PARS contrast beyond 266 nm, enhancing\nstromal visualization (e.g., collagen, elastin) and capturing red blood cells,\nmelanin, and other features through complementary radiative and non-radiative\nabsorption. The 266 nm and 355 nm pulses interrogate the sample in an\ninterlaced fashion, enabling concurrent acquisition without compromising\nimaging speed. Using the RegGAN image-translation framework, this work presents\nthe first demonstration of PARS virtual staining across multiple specialized\nstains, including Masson's trichrome, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and Jones'\nsilver, in addition to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), across diverse human and\nmurine tissues. A masked evaluation by expert pathologists showed that virtual\nstains achieved the same diagnostic quality as their chemical counterparts, and\npathologists could not reliably distinguish real from virtual stains. By\nproviding label-free multi-stain outputs from a single scan, dual-excitation\nPARS virtual staining could integrate into digital pathology workflows,\nexpanding diagnostic utility.

V830 Tau was monitored over the\ncourse of eight days with the JVLA at a frequency range of 4-8 GHz. Previous\nbrief radio observations of this purported planet-hosting star indicated a\nradio-bright source with sparse evidence of dramatic intensity changes. Our\nobservations confirm variability larger than a factor of five over the 8 days,\nwith closer-spaced data indicating a long-lived flare event spanning multiple\ndays. We discuss a hypothesis that the large, long-duration radio flare may be\nproduced as a result of magnetospheric interaction between the star and its\npurported planet, using multi-year monitoring of a few active binary systems\nwith the Green Bank Interferometer to augment our discussion. Although we\ncannot disentangle the effect of the large stellar surface area from any\neffects of orbital separation, the disputed star-planet system would have a\nlarge amount of power generated from stretching and breaking of magnetic\nfields. If this long-duration flare behavior repeats with additional data on\ntimescales close to the planetary orbital period, microwave signatures of\ninteracting magnetospheres could be a new observational tool to confirm the\nexistence of planets around young, magnetically active stars.",

Traditional methods relying on fixed structures and unimodal\ndata struggle to adapt to market regime shifts, while large language model\n(LLM)-driven solutions - despite their multi-modal comprehension - suffer from\nstatic strategies and homogeneous expert designs, lacking dynamic adjustment\nand fine-grained decision mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose\nMM-DREX: a Multimodal-driven, Dynamically-Routed EXpert framework based on\nlarge language models. MM-DREX explicitly decouples market state perception\nfrom strategy execution to enable adaptive sequential decision-making in\nnon-stationary environments. Specifically, it (1) introduces a vision-language\nmodel (VLM)-powered dynamic router that jointly analyzes candlestick chart\npatterns and long-term temporal features to allocate real-time expert weights;\n(2) designs four heterogeneous trading experts (trend, reversal, breakout,\npositioning) generating specialized fine-grained sub-strategies; and (3)\nproposes an SFT-RL hybrid training paradigm to synergistically optimize the\nrouter's market classification capability and experts' risk-adjusted\ndecision-making. Extensive experiments on multi-modal datasets spanning stocks,\nfutures, and cryptocurrencies demonstrate that MM-DREX significantly\noutperforms 15 baselines (including state-of-the-art financial LLMs and deep\nreinforcement learning models) across key metrics: total return, Sharpe ratio,\nand maximum drawdown, validating its robustness and generalization.\nAdditionally, an interpretability module traces routing logic and expert\nbehavior in real time, providing an audit trail for strategy transparency.",

Additionally, most DNN-based methods for SD are not focusing on\nfull-band (FB) signals, i.e. having 48 kHz sampling rate, and/or low latency\ncases. In this paper we present a causal, low latency, and lightweight\nDNN-based method for full-band SD, leveraging both short and long temporal\npatterns. The method is based on a modified UNet architecture employing\nlook-back frames, temporal spanning of convolutional kernels, and recurrent\nneural networks for exploiting short and long temporal patterns in the signal\nand estimated denoising mask. The DNN operates on a causal frame-by-frame basis\ntaking as an input the STFT magnitude, utilizes inverted bottlenecks inspired\nby MobileNet, employs causal instance normalization for channel-wise\nnormalization, and achieves a real-time factor below 0.02 when deployed on a\nmodern mobile phone.

    "abstract": "Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision\ntask due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that\ninfluence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at\nfeature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,\npotentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at\ndifferent levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the\nScale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture\nthat synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational\nmodeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale\nmodule with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying\nreceptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a\nsequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their\ninteractions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We\nconduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark\ndataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It\nachieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our\nfindings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale\nvisual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP.

Quantitative data were\nextracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance\nmetrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing\nmotion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited\ngeneralizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual\ndistortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and\nreporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,\nshow significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively\naddressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,\nincluding the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting\nprotocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to\nreduce reliance on extensive paired datasets.

In this work, we present a hardware-aware\ncharacterization of the Toffoli gate using optimized, connectivity-compliant\ndecompositions executed on IBM's 127-qubit superconducting quantum processors.\nOur study integrates state preparation, gate synthesis, and quantum\nstate/process tomography (QST/QPT) to evaluate fidelity across three distinct\nclasses of input states: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ), W, and the uniform\nsuperposition of all three-qubit computational basis states -- under noise-free\nsimulation, noise-aware emulation, and real hardware execution. For GHZ states,\nwe report state fidelities of 98.442% (noise-free simulation), 81.470%\n(noise-aware quantum emulation), and 56.368% (real quantum hardware). For W\nstates, state fidelities are 98.739%, 79.900%, and 63.689%, respectively, and\nfor the uniform superposition state, we observe state fidelities of 99.490%,\n85.469%, and 61.161%.

Our microscopic model shows that at high carrier densities,\nthermalization is dominated by carrier-carrier Coulomb scattering, in clear\ncontrast to the rovibrational relaxation that governs dye-based photon\ncondensates. The theory predicts a rich nonequilibrium phase diagram with\nthermal, Bose-condensed, multimode, and lasing phases, quantitatively in\nagreement with recent experiments.

In this paper, we\nconsider this problem in the context of directed graphs. The oriented Ramsey\nnumber of a digraph $G$ is the smallest integer $N$ such that every $N$-vertex\ntournament contains a copy of $G$. We prove that every bounded-degree acyclic\ndigraph with a ``local edge structure'' has a linear oriented Ramsey number.\n  More precisely, we say that a digraph $G$ has graded bandwidth $w$ if its\nvertices can be partitioned into sets $V_1, \\dots, V_H$ such that all edges $uv\n\\in E(G)$ with $u \\in V_i$ and $v \\in V_j$ satisfy $1 \\leq j - i \\leq w$. We\nprove that $\\vec{r}(G) \\leq 3^{57\\Delta w} |V(G)|$ for any acyclic $G$ with\ngraded bandwidth $w$ and maximum degree $\\Delta$.\n  This provides a common generalization of several prior results, including on\ndigraphs of bounded height, of digraphs of bounded bandwidth, and blowups of\nbounded-degree oriented trees.

Incorporating\ndetector sensitivities for scatter is challenging, as scattered coincidences\nexhibit less constrained properties (e.g., incidence angles) than true events.\nWe integrated a 5D single-photon detection probability lookup table (LUT; based\non photon properties) into the simulator logic. The resulting scatter sinogram\nis scaled by a precomputed, LUT-specific scatter sensitivity sinogram to yield\nthe final estimate. Scatter was simulated using MCGPU-PET, a fast Monte Carlo\n(MC) simulator with a simplified scanner model, and applied to phantom data\nfrom a simulated GE Signa PET/MR in GATE. We evaluated three scenarios: (1)\nlong, high-count simulations from a known activity distribution (reference);\n(2) same distribution with limited simulation time and counts; (3) same\nlow-count data with joint estimation of activity and scatter during\nreconstruction. In scenario 1, scatter-compensated reconstructions achieved <1%\nglobal bias in all active regions relative to true-only reconstructions. In\nscenario 2, noisy scatter estimates caused strong positive bias, but Gaussian\nsmoothing restored accuracy to scenario 1 levels. In scenario 3, joint\nestimation under low-count conditions maintained <1% global bias in nearly all\nregions.

Building on the\ngeometrical properties of the stable configurations, we propose a distributed\nlearning scheme in which input-output associations emerge naturally from the\nrecurrent dynamics, without any need of gradient evaluation. A critical feature\nenabling the learning process is the stability of the configurations reached at\nconvergence, even after removal of the supervisory output signal.

    "abstract": "The leading edge vortex (LEV) is one of the most important lift augmentation\nmechanisms in flapping wing aerodynamics. We propose a methodology that aims to\nprovide a quantitative description of the LEV. The first step of the method\nconsists of the identification of the vortical structures surrounding the wing\nusing the Q criterion. The impact of the employed threshold is shown to be\nminor, not influencing the observed trends. In the second step we identify the\ncore of the LEV using a thinning algorithm, discriminating the LEV using the\norientation of the locally averaged vorticity vector. Finally, we compute\nrelevant flow quantities along the LEV core, by averaging in planes\nperpendicular to the local vorticity at the LEV core points. We have applied\nthis methodology to flow data corresponding to a pair of wings performing a\nflapping motion in forward flight at moderate Reynolds number. We have\nperformed a geometrical characterization of the LEV, and we have computed\nseveral flow quantities along the LEV core. For the particular configuration\nunder study, we have shown that the LEV, during the first half of the\ndownstroke develops and grows increasing its circulation smoothly.\nApproximately at mid-downstroke the leading edge vortex starts splitting, and\nits downstream part is advected towards the wake while keeping its circulation\nrather constant. Finally, we have briefly explored the link between the\nsectional lift on the wing and the local circulation obtained with the present\nmethodology.",

A container is filled with water and\ntopped by a thin layer of oil, representing the molten steel and slag,\nrespectively. The system is agitated by a bubble plume that impinges on the oil\nlayer and forms an open-eye. A tracer species, dissolved in the water, acts as\na passive scalar that is progressively absorbed into the oil layer. Both the\nhydrodynamics and mass transfer in the system are studied and compared with\nexperiments from the literature of different size and geometry.\n  The numerical simulation of mass transfer is challenging due to the high\nP\\'eclet number, leading to extremely thin species boundary layers at the\ninterface. Resolving the boundary layer is prohibitive even with adaptive grid\ntechniques. A subgrid-scale (SGS) boundary layer model corrects the scalar\ntransport equation, allowing us to solve convection-dominated transport on\nrelatively coarse grids. The hydrodynamics is investigated, and we analyze how\nthe resultant flow field governs mass transport. The numerical results recover\ntwo flow regimes: a quasi-steady regime at low flow rates with small\ndeformations of the oil-water interface and an atomizing regime at large flow\nrates. Interfacial species transport is determined to be dominated in an\nannulus surrounding the open eye caused by a shear layer at the oil-water\ninterface.

The abundances of Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe measured with\nthe CCD detector Xtend during M- and X-class flares show the\ninverse-first-ionization-potential (inverse-FIP) effect, which is consistent\nwith the results of Katsuda et al., ApJ, 2020 using the Suzaku satellite. The\nabundances of Si, S, and Ar are found to decrease with increasing flare\nmagnitude, which is consistent with the theoretical model by Laming (Laming,\nApJ, 2021), whereas Ca exhibits an opposite trend. The large effective area and\nfield of view of Xtend allow us to trace the evolution of the abundances in\nseveral X-class flare loops on a timescale of a few 100 s, finding an\nenrichment of low-FIP elements before flare peaks. The high-resolution Fe-K\nspectrum obtained with the microcalorimeter Resolve successfully separates the\nRayleigh- and Compton-scattered Fe XXIV/XXV lines and neutral or low-ionized\nFe-K$\\alpha$ lines. The neutral/low-ionized Fe-K$\\alpha$ equivalent width shows\nan anti-correlation with hard X-ray flux with the best-fit power-law slope of\n$-0.14 \\pm 0.09$, suggesting that hard X-rays from flare loops are stimulating\nthe Fe K$\\alpha$ fluorescence. This work demonstrates that XRISM can be a\npowerful tool in the field of solar physics, offering valuable high-statistic\nCCD data and high-resolution microcalorimeter spectra in the energy range\nextending to the Fe-K band.",

Idle\nanimations, such as standing, breathing or looking around, are crucial for\nrealism and believability. In games and virtual applications, these are often\nhandcrafted or recorded with actors, but this is costly. Furthermore, recording\nrealistic idle animations can be very complex, because the actor must not know\nthey are being recorded in order to make genuine movements. For this reasons\nidle animation datasets are not widely available. Nevertheless, this paper\nconcludes that both acted and genuine idle animations are perceived as real,\nand that users are not able to distinguish between them. It also states that\nhandmade and recorded idle animations are perceived differently. These two\nconclusions mean that recording idle animations should be easier than it is\nthought to be, meaning that actors can be specifically told to act the\nmovements, significantly simplifying the recording process. These conclusions\nshould help future efforts to record idle animation datasets. Finally, we also\npublish ReActIdle, a 3 dimensional idle animation dataset containing both real\nand acted idle motions.",

However, due to severe illumination degradation and the\nlack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle\nto quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,\nthere is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on\nlow-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically\ngrounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light\nsettings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to\ndate for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance\nsegmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable\nLearning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to\nenhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:\na light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature\nextraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient\nrepresentation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable\nlearning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise\nmulti-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it\noutperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1\npercentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of\nbaseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic.

This approach\nallows for a reduction in the size of the phase (or counting) register from\nthousands of qubits down to a small, fixed block size of only a few qubits (for\nexample, three or four), while leaving the work register requirement unchanged.\nThe independence of the blocks allows for parallel execution and makes the\napproach more compatible with near-term hardware than the standard Shor's\nformulation. An additional feature of the framework is the overlap mechanism,\nwhich introduces redundancy between blocks and enables robust reconstruction of\nphase information, though zero-overlap configurations can also succeed in\ncertain regimes.

Despite their\nwidespread success, these methods rely on empirical physical assumptions and do\nnot leverage low-rank structures across parameters of the parametric problem.\n  To address these limitations, our previous work introduced a reduced-order\nmodel (ROM) enhanced preconditioner called ROMSAD, which exploits low-rank\nstructures across parameters and the original kinetic description of the\ncorrection equation. While ROMSAD improves overall efficiency compared with\nDSA, its efficiency reduces after the first iteration, because the construction\nof the underlying ROM ignores the preconditioner-dependence of the residual\ntrajectory, leading to a mismatch between the offline and online residual\ntrajectories.\n  To overcome this issue, we introduce a trajectory-aware framework that\niteratively constructs ROMs to eliminate the mismatch between offline and\nonline residual trajectories.

We leverage that preservation to derive structural\nresults that, taken together, yield a canonical transfer of broad\nharmonic-analytic results from characteristic $0$ to characteristic $p$. When\n$F$ has suitably large positive characteristic, we prove a block-by-block\nequivalence: each Bernstein block of $G(F)$ is equivalent to a corresponding\nblock for some $G'(F')$ with $F'$ of characteristic $0$ $\\ell$-close to $F$;\nusing this, we show that an LLC in characteristic $0$ corresponds canonically\nto an LLC in characteristic $p$. For regular supercuspidals we give a direct,\nmore structured construction via Kaletha. Along the way we recover and extend\nresults on $\\ell$-close fields -- introducing a depth-transfer function\ngeneralizing the normalized Hasse--Herbrand function, proving truncated\nisomorphisms for arbitrary tori and parahorics, establishing a depth- and\nsupercuspidality-preserving Kazhdan-type Hecke-algebra isomorphism for\narbitrary maximal parahorics of arbitrary connected reductive groups; and a\ngeneralized Cartan decomposition for arbitrary maximal parahorics -- thereby\nsubsuming several earlier results in the literature.

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, more than 25 phylogenetic tree balance indices and\nseveral families of such indices have been proposed in the literature -- some\nof which even contain infinitely many members. It is well established that\ndifferent indices have different strengths and perform unequally across\napplication scenarios. For example, power analyses have shown that the ability\nof an index to detect the generative model of a given phylogenetic tree varies\nsignificantly between indices. This variation in performance motivates the\nongoing search for new and possibly \\enquote{better} (im)balance indices. An\neasy way to generate a new index is to construct a compound index, e.g., a\nlinear combination of established indices.\n  Two of the most prominent and widely used imbalance indices in this context\nare the Sackin index and the Colless index. In this study, we show that these\nclassic indices are themselves compound in nature: they can be decomposed into\nmore elementary components that independently satisfy the defining properties\nof a tree (im)balance index. We further show that the difference Colless minus\nSackin results in another imbalance index that is minimized (amongst others) by\nall Colless minimal trees. Conversely, the difference Sackin minus Colless\nforms a balance index.\n  Finally, we compare the building blocks of which the Sackin and the Colless\nindices consist to these indices as well as to the stairs2 index, which is\nanother index from the literature. Our results suggest that the elementary\nbuilding blocks we identify are not only foundational to established indices\nbut also valuable tools for analyzing disagreement among indices when comparing\nthe balance of different trees.",

    "abstract": "Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems are highly vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks that are often imperceptible to humans, primarily due to a\nmisalignment between model feature spaces and human auditory perception.\nExisting defenses and perceptual metrics frequently fail to adequately capture\nthese auditory nuances, a limitation supported by our initial listening tests\nshowing low correlation between common metrics and human judgments. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce Perceptually-Aligned MERT Transformer (PAMT), a novel\nframework for learning robust, perceptually-aligned music representations. Our\ncore innovation lies in the psychoacoustically-conditioned sequential\ncontrastive transformer, a lightweight projection head built atop a frozen MERT\nencoder. PAMT achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.65 with\nsubjective scores, outperforming existing perceptual metrics. Our approach also\nachieves an average of 9.15\\% improvement in robust accuracy on challenging MIR\ntasks, including Cover Song Identification and Music Genre Classification,\nunder diverse perceptual adversarial attacks. This work pioneers\narchitecturally-integrated psychoacoustic conditioning, yielding\nrepresentations significantly more aligned with human perception and robust\nagainst music adversarial attacks.",

    "abstract": "New observations with the current generation of advanced radio\ninterferometers, such as ASKAP and MeerKAT, have led to the discovery of new\nclasses of extended radio sources of unknown origin, including the so-called\nOdd Radio Circles (ORCs). These phenomena are detected exclusively in the radio\ncontinuum, with no clear counterparts at other wavelengths, making their\nphysical nature and origin a subject of ongoing investigation. To better\nunderstand these objects, we study their radio continuum emission, spectral\ncharacteristics, and magnetic field properties. In this work, we present a\nradio spectropolarimetry analysis of a newly discovered ORC (ORC J0356-4216)\nthat exhibits a rare double-ring morphology. We use data from the MeerKAT\nL-band and from the ASKAP Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) at 943 MHz.\nORC J0356-4216 shows a symmetric double-ring structure with a diameter of\napproximately 2 arcminutes, corresponding to a physical size of 668 kpc based\non the redshift ($0.494 \\pm 0.068$) of its apparent host galaxy WISEA\nJ035609.67-421603.5. The radio spectra of both rings are steep, with spectral\nindices of $-1.18 \\pm 0.03$ and $-1.12 \\pm 0.05$, and show no significant\nsubstructure. Equipartition magnetic field strengths (assuming K0 = 1) are\nestimated to be 1.82 microGauss and 1.65 microGauss for the respective rings.\nThe degree of polarisation across the object ranges between 20-30%, consistent\nwith a non-thermal synchrotron origin. The morphology and polarisation are\nbroadly consistent with large-scale shocks driven by powerful starburst\noutflows. However, the high degree of symmetry, the coherent double-ring\nstructure, and the absence of internal substructure are features commonly\nassociated with relic AGN lobes, making this scenario particularly compatible\nwith the observed characteristics.",

This is often a key\nobstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.\nIn this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm\nlayer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform\nmore stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.\nHowever, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed\nand still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial\nsolutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into\nthis, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often\nundergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that\ncertain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)\nthe model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification\nbias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy\nminimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)\nremove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights\nto go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy\nsamples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation\ncollapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce\ninter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an\ninequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype\ncentroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.\nPromising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior\nmethods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.",

The problem is NP-hard and UGC-hard to approximate\nin polynomial time within any constant factor even when $r = m = 2$. We focus\non parameterized approximation with solution size as the parameter. Dabrowski\net al. showed that Min-$2$-Lin$(Z_m)$ is in FPT if $m$ is prime (i.e. $Z_m$ is\na field), and it is W[1]-hard if $m$ is not a prime power. We show that\nMin-$2$-Lin$(Z_{p^n})$ is FPT-approximable within a factor of $2$ for every\nprime $p$ and integer $n \\geq 2$. This implies that Min-$2$-Lin$(Z_m)$, $m \\in\nZ^+$, is FPT-approximable within a factor of $2\\omega(m)$ where $\\omega(m)$\ncounts the number of distinct prime divisors of $m$. The idea behind the\nalgorithm is to solve ever tighter relaxations of the problem, decreasing the\nset of possible values for the variables at each step. Working over $Z_{p^n}$\nand viewing the values in base-$p$, one can roughly think of a relaxation as\nfixing the number of trailing zeros and the least significant nonzero digits of\nthe values assigned to the variables. To solve the relaxed problem, we\nconstruct a certain graph where solutions can be identified with a particular\ncollection of cuts. The relaxation may hide obstructions that will only become\nvisible in the next iteration of the algorithm, which makes it difficult to\nfind optimal solutions. To deal with this, we use a strategy based on shadow\nremoval to compute solutions that (1) cost at most twice as much as the optimum\nand (2) allow us to reduce the set of values for all variables simultaneously.\nWe complement the algorithmic result with two lower bounds, ruling out\nconstant-factor FPT-approximation for Min-$3$-Lin$(R)$ over any nontrivial ring\n$R$ and for Min-$2$-Lin$(R)$ over some finite commutative rings $R$.",

It aims to tackle the challenges\nof decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic\ntopologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph\nconvolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order\ndependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of\nstate representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on\npolicy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural\nupdates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world\nGEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against\nseveral representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and\nlink balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity,\ngraph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further\nexplore the impact of structure modeling and graph updates on model stability\nand decision quality.

Our approach integrates three complementary\ntraits: (1) accessibility traits, learned via contrastive learning to encode\nproximity to essential infrastructure; (2) morphological traits, derived from\nbuilding footprints to reflect housing conditions in informal settlements; and\n(3) economic traits, inferred from nightlight intensity as a proxy for economic\nactivity. To mitigate spurious correlations - such as those from\nnon-residential nightlight sources that misrepresent poverty conditions - we\nincorporate a backdoor adjustment mechanism that leverages morphological traits\nduring training of the economic module. By fusing these complementary features\ninto a unified representation, our framework captures the complex nature of\npoverty, which often diverges from economic development trends. Evaluations\nacross three capital cities - Cape Town, Dhaka, and Phnom Penh - show that our\nmodel significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a robust tool for\npoverty mapping and policy support in data-scarce regions.",

One prior work has explored fine-tuning a\nlightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a\ntext-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the\nMultiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper\napproach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by\nfusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear\nmapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels\nbetween cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our\nMFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency.

Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) size\nprofiles offer a promising noninvasive multi-cancer approach to monitor and\npredict immunotherapy response. Methods: In the SChISM (Size CfDNA\nImmunotherapy Signature Monitoring) study (NCT05083494), pre-treatment\nplasmatic cfDNA size profiles from 126 ICI-treated advanced carcinomas were\nquantified using the BIABooster device. Fragmentomederived variables\n(concentration, peaks' position, and fragment size ranges) at baseline were\nanalyzed for associations with early progression (EP, progression at first\nimaging) and progression-free survival (PFS), using logistic and Cox regression\nmodels. Bootstrap analysis validated robustness. Additional analyses were\nperformed in homogeneous subpopulations: first-line lung cancer patients (n =\n60) and head-andneck patients treated with Nivolumab (n = 25). Results: Higher\ncfDNA concentration and high quantities of short fragments (111-240 base pairs\n(bp)) were associated with poor response, unlike long fragments (> 300 bp). The\nproportion of fragments longer than 1650 bp demonstrated highest discriminatory\npower (AUC = 0.73, C-index = 0.69). It was significantly associated with non-EP\n(odds ratio = 0.39 [95% CI: 0.25-0.62]) and longer PFS (hazard ratio: 0.54 [95%\nCI: 0.42-0.68]). These associations remained significant when adjusted for\nconfounders (age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status,\ntumor type, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) and across both subpopulations.\nBootstrap analysis confirmed robustness with mean accuracy of 70.1 $\\pm$ 4.17%\nand positive predictive value of 55.6 $\\pm$ 7.37%, in test sets. Conclusion:\ncfDNA size profiles significantly predicted ICI response and anticipate\nrelapse, outperforming the routinely used marker programmed death-ligand 1\nimmunohistochemistry and reflecting enhanced immune system activation.

To close that knowledge gap, this paper\npresents the first large-scale empirical study of floating-point arithmetic\nusage in statically typed languages across public GitHub repositories. We\nfollow state-of the art mining practices including random sampling and\nfiltering based on only intrinsic properties to avoid bias, and identify\nfloating-point usage by searching for keywords in the source code, and\nprogramming language constructs (e.g., loops) by parsing the code. Our\nevaluation supports the claim often made in papers that floating-point\narithmetic is widely used. Comparing statistics such as size and usage of\ncertain constructs and functions, we find that benchmarks used in literature to\nevaluate automated reasoning techniques for floating-point arithmetic are in\ncertain aspects representative of 'real-world' code, but not in all.

Methods: Dosimetric characterization and dual\nchannel Cherenkov correction were investigated using reference ionization\nchambers. Percentage depth dose curves, lateral profiles and output-factors\nwere compared to reference ionization chambers. Surface doses were measured on\nsolid water and on an anthropomorphic phantom and compared to ionization\nchamber and radiochromic film measurements. Results: The investigated PSD\ndemonstrated clinically acceptable linearity, dose rate independence, isotropy\nand reproducibility (total variation <2%). The detector measured R50 and R80 to\n0.5 mm accuracy and lateral profiles with a mean absolute error below 1.5%.\nSmall field measurements were within 2% of reference ionization chamber.\nSurface dose measurements had a relative deviation of 0.9% from ionization\nchamber and 2.6% from radiochromic film measurements.

Firstly, we derive an analytical expression of GQD for\ntwo-qutrit quantum systems and further generalize it for $d_1\\otimes d_2$\ndimensional systems. Next, we apply the concept of GQD in studying QKD. In\nparticular, we derive the lower bound for a distillable secret key rate $K_D$\nin terms of GQD when two communicating parties uses private states for\ngenerating a secret key in the presence of an eavesdropper.

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes\nacross diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics,\nfinance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is\na challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation\nmodels applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the\nrecognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods\nhave been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,\nconstruct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a\nmethodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic\ntime series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time\nseries data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling\ninterval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training\nusing 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test\ndatasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed\nzero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of\nevaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these\npredictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over\nautocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we\nobserved a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive\nperformance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic\ntime series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this\nscaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it\nsuggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial\ncomputational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale\ntraining and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic\nmodels.",

This study addresses three open issues: the\nunusual broadening of the DIB profile towards Upper Sco (USco), the lack of\nprofile variations towards stars near $\\eta$ Car, and the origin of the\nblueshift observed in Sco OB1. Using archival spectra of 453 early-type stars\nacross the Galactic disk and in its proximity, we created a catalogue of the\nDIB's profile parameters. Our analysis identified Doppler-split components\nwithin the DIB profiles across most regions with no evidence for these splits\nbeing able to account for the observed broadening (23 km/s) in USco or other\nregions such as Orion, Vela OB2, and Melotte 20 ($\\alpha$ Per cluster). We\npropose that neither the ages of the studied stellar populations nor the\ndistances between clusters and nearby clouds significantly contribute to the\nbroadening. However, we detect a gradient in the full width at half maximum\nwithin the Sco-Cen and Orion regions, where broadening decreases with distance\nfrom the star-forming centres. This result points to a possible connection\nbetween the DIB broadening and star formation (likely via the impact of recent\nsupernovae). Regarding the Carina Nebula, we confirm the lack of DIB profile\nvariations in a small region near $\\eta$ Car, although an adjacent southern\narea exhibits significant variations, comparable to those in USco. In addition\nto the Carina Nebula, we find that the Rosette Nebula and NGC 6405 also show\nconsistently narrow profiles (<20 km/s) with minimal deviations from the median\nover spatial scales of a few parsecs. Finally, regarding the origin of the\nblueshift observed in Sco OB1, we used a comparison with the Lagoon Nebula and\nargue that the most natural explanation is the presence of an unresolved\nkinematic component in the profile of the DIB, shifting the measured centre of\nthe band.",

    "abstract": "The concern of the present paper is the design of efficient numerical schemes\nfor a specific Fokker-Planck equation describing the dynamics of energetic\nparticles occurring in thermonuclear fusion plasmas (runaway electrons for\nexample). In the long-time limit, the velocity distribution function of these\nparticles tends towards a thermal non-equilibrium $\\kappa$-distribution\nfunction which is a steady-state of the considered Fokker-Planck equation.\nThese $\\kappa$-distribution functions have the particularity of being only\nalgebraically decaying for large velocities, thus describing very well\nsuprathermal particle populations. Our aim is to present two efficient spectral\nmethods for the simulation of such energetic particle dynamics. The first\nmethod will be based on rational Chebyshev basis functions, rather than on\nHermite basis sets, which are the basis of choice for Maxwellian steady states.\nThe second method is based on a different polynomial basis set, constructed via\nthe Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation process. These two new spectral schemes,\nspecifically adapted to the here considered physical context, shall permit to\ncope with the long-time asymptotics without significant numerical costs.",

Recently, proposals for\ngeneralizing quasi-periodictopological pumping and identifying possible\nphysical settings for its implementa-tion have emerged. In a strict sense,\npumping with incommensurate frequencies canonly manifest over infinite\nevolution distances, raising a fundamental question aboutits observability in\nreal-world finite-dimensional systems. Here we demonstrate thatbi-chromatic\ntopological pumping with two frequencies, whose ratio is an irrationalnumber,\ncan be viewed as the convergence limit of pumping with two\ncommensuratefrequencies representing the best rational approximations of that\nirrational number. In our experiment, this phenomenon is observed as the\ndisplacement of a light beamcenter in photorefractive crystals induced by two\noptical lattices. The longitudinalperiods of the lattices, that in the paraxial\napproximation emulate two pumping fre-quencies, are related as Fibonacci\nnumbers, successively approaching the golden ratio. We observed that a\none-cycle displacement of the beam center at each successiveapproximation is\ndetermined by the relation between successive Fibonacci numbers,while the\naverage direction of propagation (emulating average pumping velocity) ofthe\nbeam is determined by the golden ratio.",

In this study, we show that incorporating\nan off-fault damage zone-characterized by distributed fractures surrounding a\nmain fault-can reproduce many key features observed in seismic and geodetic\ndata. We model a 2D shear fault zone in which off-fault cracks follow power-law\nsize and density distributions, and are oriented either optimally or parallel\nto the main fault. All fractures follow the rate-and-state friction law with\nparameters chosen such that each can host slip instabilities.

Despite the spatially uniform\nfrictional properties, we observe a natural continuum from slow to fast\nruptures, as observed in nature. Our simulations reproduce the Omori law, the\ninverse Omori law, the Gutenberg-Richter scaling, and the moment-duration\nscaling. We also observe seismicity localizing toward the main fault when an\nevent is about to nucleate on the main fault. During slow slip events,\noff-fault seismicity migrates in a pattern resembling a fluid diffusion front,\ndespite the absence of fluids in the model.

To address the above issues, we propose\nSparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization\nprecision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are\nsimultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based\ndiscrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a\npre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token\nrouter and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations\ninherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token\ngeneration process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the\ninference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on\na modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model\nto identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.\nMoreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to\nsystematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across\ndiverse scenarios.

While previous results extended\nSarason's work to finitely supported measures $\\mu$, the symbols we consider\nhere give a natural framework to go beyond finiteness of the support. In our\nsetting, we provide a complete characterization of measures $\\mu$ for which\n$\\mathcal{H}(b) = \\mathcal{D}_\\mu$, thereby resolving the long-standing open\nproblem of constructing harmonically weighted Dirichlet spaces\n$\\mathcal{D}_\\mu$ associated with measures $\\mu$ of infinite support that are\nalso $\\mathcal{H}(b)$ spaces. As a central ingredient to prove this result and\nwhich is of independent interest, we establish a $T(1)$-type result for the\nCauchy transform on $L^2(\\sigma)$, where $\\sigma$ denotes the Clark measure\nassociated with a one-component inner function $u$. Another notable result is a\nperturbation theorem for one-component inner functions that allows us to\npresent a large class of function spaces satisfying\n$\\mathcal{H}(b)=\\mathcal{D}_\\mu$.

One of these lattice charges satisfies the Onsager algebra.\nOn the lattice, the charges $Q_F$ do not commute with $Q_0$, and no symmetric\nmass term exists that commutes with both $Q_0$ and $Q_F$. This signals the\npresence of a mixed anomaly. Remarkably, however, in the continuum limit, a\nsymmetric mass term commuting with both $Q_0$ and $Q_F$ can be constructed. %\nThis implies that the non-trivial lattice anomaly becomes a trivial anomaly in\nthe continuum QFT. This means that the mixed anomaly that is nontrivial on the\nlattice becomes trivial in the IR QFT obtained in the continuum limit, which is\nconsistent with the analysis of the Ward--Takahashi (WT) identity on the\nlattice.

(2) Focus on coarse-grained quality optimization\ndimensions, such as relevance, coherence, and helpfulness, overlooking the\nfine-grained specifics inherent to diverse long-form generation scenarios.

ACE-RL first\nautomatically deconstructs each instruction into a set of fine-grained,\nadaptive constraint criteria by identifying its underlying intents and demands.\nSubsequently, we design a reward mechanism that quantifies the quality of\nlong-form responses based on their satisfaction over corresponding constraints,\nconverting subjective quality evaluation into constraint verification. Finally,\nwe utilize reinforcement learning to guide models toward superior long-form\ngeneration capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-RL\nframework significantly outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 20.70% and\n7.32% on WritingBench, and our top-performing model even surpasses proprietary\nsystems like GPT-4o by 7.10%, providing a more effective training paradigm for\nLLMs to generate high-quality content across diverse long-form generation\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "In this report, we introduce PLaMo 2, a series of Japanese-focused large\nlanguage models featuring a hybrid Samba-based architecture that transitions to\nfull attention via continual pre-training to support 32K token contexts.\nTraining leverages extensive synthetic corpora to overcome data scarcity, while\ncomputational efficiency is achieved through weight reuse and structured\npruning. This efficient pruning methodology produces an 8B model that achieves\nperformance comparable to our previous 100B model. Post-training further\nrefines the models using a pipeline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct\npreference optimization (DPO), enhanced by synthetic Japanese instruction data\nand model merging techniques. Optimized for inference using vLLM and\nquantization with minimal accuracy loss, the PLaMo 2 models achieve\nstate-of-the-art results on Japanese benchmarks, outperforming similarly-sized\nopen models in instruction-following, language fluency, and Japanese-specific\nknowledge.",

    "abstract": "Optical metasurfaces supporting resonances with high quality factors offer an\noutstanding platform for applications such as non-linear optics, light guiding,\nlasing, sensing, light-matter coupling, and quantum optics. However, their\nexperimental realization typically demands elaborate multi-step procedures such\nas metal or dielectric deposition, lift-off, and reactive ion etching. As a\nconsequence, accessibility, large-scale production and sustainability are\nconstrained by reliance on cost-, time- and labor-intensive facilities. We\novercome this fabrication hurdle by repurposing polymethyl methacrylate-which\nis usually employed as a temporary resist-as the resonator material, thereby\neliminating all steps except for spin-coating, exposure and development.\nBecause the low refractive index of the polymer limits effective mode\nformation, we present a bilayer recipe that enables the convenient fabrication\nof a freestanding membrane to maximize the index contrast with its\nsurroundings. Since etching induced defects are circumvented, the membrane\nfeatures high quality nanopatterns. We further examine the suspended membrane\nwith scanning electron microscopy and extract its position-dependent spring\nconstant and pretension with nanoindentation experiments applied by the tip of\nan atomic force microscope. Our all-polymer metasurface hosting Bound States in\nthe Continuum experimentally delivers high quality factors (up to 523) at\nvisible and near infrared wavelengths, despite the low refractive index of the\npolymer, and enables straightforward geometry-based tuning of both linewidth\nand resonance position. We envision this methodology to lay the groundwork for\naccessible, high performance metasurfaces with unique use cases such as\nmaterial blending, angled writing and mechanically based resonance tuning.",

Two models were\nbenchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated\npatch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50\nfeatures with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation\nshowed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)\ncompared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =\n10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds.

This paper presents the first analytical investigation of PASS in\na circular indoor environment, encompassing both full coverage and partial\ncoverage waveguide configurations with/without propagation loss. A unified\ngeometric-propagation framework is developed that jointly captures\npinching-antenna placement, Internet of Things (IoT) device location\ndistribution, and waveguide attenuation. Closed-form expressions for the outage\nprobability and average achievable rate are derived for four scenarios, with\naccuracy validated via extensive Monte-Carlo simulations.

Numerical results further quantify the interplay between\ndeployment strategy, waveguide propagation loss, and coverage geometry,\noffering practical guidelines for performance-oriented PASS design.",

However, the high\ncomputational requirements to fine-tune these LLMs on downstream tasks pose\nsignificant challenges, particularly when resources are limited. In response to\nthis challenge, we introduce L1RA, a novel technique aimed at dynamically\ndistributing the rank of low-rank adapters during fine-tuning using LoRA. Given\na rank budget (i.e., total sum of adapters rank), L1RA leverages L1\nregularisation to prune redundant ranks and redistribute them across adapters,\nthereby optimising resource utilisation. Through a series of comprehensive\nexperiments, we empirically demonstrate that L1RA maintains comparable or even\nreduced computational overhead compared to other LoRA variants, including the\nvanilla approach, while achieving same or better performances. Moreover, the\npost-training analysis of rank distribution unveiled insights into the specific\nmodel components requiring the most adaptation to align with the task\nobjective: the feed-forward layers and the attention output projection.

Recently, equivariant\nmessage passing neural networks (MPNNs) that explicitly incorporate symmetry\nconstraints have demonstrated promise for interatomic potential and density\nfunctional theory (DFT) Hamiltonian predictions. However, the high-order\ntensors used to represent node and edge information are coupled through the\nClebsch-Gordan tensor product (CGTP), leading to steep increases in\ncomputational complexity and seriously hindering the performance of equivariant\nMPNNs. Here, we develop High-order Tensor machine-learning Hamiltonian\n(Hot-Ham), an E(3) equivariant MPNN framework that combines two advanced\ntechnologies local coordinate transformation and Gaunt tensor product (GTP) to\nefficiently model DFT Hamiltonians. These two innovations significantly reduce\nthe complexity of tensor products from O(L^6) to O(L^3) or O(L^2 log^2 L) for\nthe max tensor order L, and enhance the performance of MPNNs. Benchmarks on\nseveral public datasets demonstrate its state-of-the-art accuracy with\nrelatively few parameters, and the applications to multilayer twisted moir\\'e\nsystems, heterostructures and allotropes showcase its generalization ability\nand high efficiency.

The objective is to minimize the\npower required for satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) of sensing and\ncommunication by jointly optimizing the MIRS element positions, IRS reflection\ncoefficients, transmit beamforming, and receive filters. To balance the\nperformance-cost trade-off, we proposed two MIRS schemes: element-wise control\nand array-wise control, where the positions of individual reflecting elements\nand arrays consisting of multiple elements are controllable, respectively. To\naddress the joint beamforming and position optimization, a product Riemannian\nmanifold optimization (PRMO) method is proposed, where the variables are\nupdated over a constructed product Riemannian manifold space (PRMS) in parallel\nvia penalty-based transformation and Riemannian\nBroyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (RBFGS) algorithm. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed MIRS outperforms conventional IRS in power\nminimization with both element-wise control and array-wise control.\nSpecifically, with different system parameters, the minimum power is achieved\nby the MIRS with the element-wise control scheme, while suboptimal solution and\nhigher computational efficiency are achieved by the MIRS with array-wise\ncontrol scheme.",

However, these data are\noften acquired days or even months apart, during which various changes may\noccur, such as vegetation disturbances (e.g., logging, and wildfires) and\nvariations in imaging quality. Such temporal misalignments introduce\ncross-modal uncertainty, especially in high-resolution imagery, which can\nseverely degrade segmentation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose\nMURTreeFormer, a novel multi-modal segmentation framework that mitigates and\nleverages aleatoric uncertainty for robust tree cover mapping. MURTreeFormer\ntreats one modality as primary and others as auxiliary, explicitly modeling\npatch-level uncertainty in the auxiliary modalities via a probabilistic latent\nrepresentation. Uncertain patches are identified and reconstructed from the\nprimary modality's distribution through a VAE-based resampling mechanism,\nproducing enhanced auxiliary features for fusion. In the decoder, a gradient\nmagnitude attention (GMA) module and a lightweight refinement head (RH) are\nfurther integrated to guide attention toward tree-like structures and to\npreserve fine-grained spatial details. Extensive experiments on multi-modal\ndatasets from Shanghai and Zurich demonstrate that MURTreeFormer significantly\nimproves segmentation performance and effectively reduces the impact of\ntemporally induced aleatoric uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "High-harmonic generation (HHG) is one of the fundamental processes at the\nheart of attosecond physics. Traditionally viewed as an effective\nsingle-particle effect, recent advances have focused on contributions beyond\nthis single-particle picture to the harmonic spectrum, as well as on probing\nelectron correlations through HHG in atoms, molecules, and solids. In this\npaper, we introduce a reduced density matrix description to explore and to\nquantify correlation effects on a sub-cycle time scale and apply this approach\nto prototypical multi-electron atoms. By comparing noble gas atoms (He, Ne)\nwith alkaline earth atoms (Be, Mg) exposed to driving fields with similar\nKeldysh parameters, we show that the sub-cycle variation of correlation\nparameters differs markedly for noble gases and alkaline earth atoms. We\nprovide an intuitive explanation of these surprising effects based on the\ndynamics of natural orbitals and discuss the effect of this ultrafast\ncorrelation dynamics on the HHG spectrum.",

Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario-based\ndataset comprising diverse textual descriptions of fictional facts, annotated\nwith scenario elements.

Specifically, we investigate a modular RA-enabled mixed-field\ndownlink communication system, where a base station (BS) consisting of multiple\nRA subarrays communicates with multiple near-field users in the presence of\nseveral legacy far-field users. We formulate an optimization problem to\nmaximize the sum-rate of the near-field users by jointly optimizing the power\nallocation and rotation angles of all subarrays at the BS. To gain useful\ninsights into the effect of RAs on mixed-field communications, we first analyze\na special case where all subarrays share the same rotation angle and obtain\nclosed-form expressions for the rotation-aware normalized near-field\ninterference and the rotation-aware normalized mixed-field interference using\nthe Fresnel integrals. We then analytically reveal that array rotation\neffectively suppresses both interference types, thereby significantly enhancing\nmixed-field communication performance. For the general case involving\nsubarray-wise rotation, we propose an efficient double-layer algorithm to\nobtain a high-quality solution, where the inner layer optimizes power\nallocation using the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, while the\nouter layer determines the rotation angles of all subarrays via particle swarm\noptimization (PSO). Finally, numerical results highlight the significant\nperformance gains achieved by RAs over conventional fixed-antenna systems and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our developed joint design compared to\nbenchmark schemes.",

    "abstract": "Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are cold, dense structures representative of the\ninitial conditions of star formation. Many studies of IRDCs employ CO to\ninvestigate cloud dynamics. However, CO can be highly depleted from the gas\nphase in IRDCs, impacting its fidelity as tracer. CO depletion is also of great\ninterest in astrochemistry, since CO ice in dust grain mantles provides the raw\nmaterial for forming complex organic molecules. We study CO depletion toward\nfour IRDCs to investigate how it correlates with volume density and dust\ntemperature, calculated from Herschel images. We use 13CO(1-0) and (2-1) maps\nto measure CO depletion factor, $f_D$, across IRDCs G23.46-00.53, G24.49-00.70,\nG24.94-00.15, and G25.16-00.28. We also consider a normalized CO depletion\nfactor, f_D', which takes a value of unity, i.e., no depletion, in the outer,\nlower density, warmer regions. We then investigate the dependence of f_D and\nf_D' on gas density, $n_H$ and dust temperature, $T_{dust}$. We find CO\ndepletion rises as density increases, reaching maximum values of f_D'$\\sim$10\nin regions with $n_H>3\\times10^5\\:{cm}^{-3}$, although with significant scatter\nat a given density. We find a tighter, less scattered relation of f_D' with\ntemperature, rising rapidly for temperatures <18 K. We propose a functional\nform $f_D^\\prime = \\:{exp}(T_0/[T_{dust}-T_1])$ with $T_0\\simeq4\\:$K and\n$T_1\\simeq12\\:$K to reproduce this behaviour. We conclude that CO is heavily\ndepleted from the gas phase in cold, dense regions of IRDCs. Thus CO depletion\ncan lead to underestimation of total cloud masses based on CO line fluxes by\nfactors up to 5. These results indicate a dominant role for thermal desorption\nin setting near equilibrium abundances of gas phase CO in IRDCs, providing\nimportant constraints for both astrochemical models and the chemodynamical\nhistory of gas during the early stages of star formation.",

    "abstract": "Electromagnetic (EM) imaging is an important tool for non-invasive sensing\nwith low-cost and portable devices. One emerging application is EM stroke\nimaging, which enables early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of brain\nstrokes. Quantitative imaging is achieved by solving an inverse scattering\nproblem (ISP) that reconstructs permittivity and conductivity maps from\nmeasurements. In general, the reconstruction accuracy is limited by its\ninherent nonlinearity and ill-posedness. Existing methods, including\nlearning-free and learning-based approaches, fail to either incorporate\ncomplicated prior distributions or provide theoretical guarantees, posing\ndifficulties in balancing interpretability, distortion error, and reliability.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a posterior sampling method based on\nlatent diffusion for quantitative EM brain imaging, adapted from a generative\nplug-and-play (PnP) posterior sampling framework. Our approach allows to\nflexibly integrate prior knowledge into physics-based inversion without\nrequiring paired measurement-label datasets. We first learn the prior\ndistribution of targets from an unlabeled dataset, and then incorporate the\nlearned prior into posterior sampling. In particular, we train a latent\ndiffusion model on permittivity and conductivity maps to capture their prior\ndistribution. Then, given measurements and the forward model describing EM wave\nphysics, we perform posterior sampling by alternating between two samplers that\nrespectively enforce the likelihood and prior distributions. Finally, reliable\nreconstruction is obtained through minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation\nbased on the samples. Experimental results on brain imaging demonstrate that\nour approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction accuracy\nand structural similarity while maintaining high measurement fidelity.",

Instead\nof reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to\nfocus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots\nequipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data\nacquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene\noptimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering\nhigh-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental\nlearning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful\nper-splat features to isolate objects effectively.\n  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training\ncycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the\nsemantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.\nTo balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose\nCoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS\nand then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based\neffective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the\ntraining process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for\nsemantic GS.

Both equal-spin CAR and equal-spin LAR exhibit a\nremarkable magnetoanisotropy with period \\pi and show oscillatory behavior with\nchemical potential. The equal-spin CAR is more prominent for half-metal F and\ndouble-band ISC while the normal CAR is completely suppressed. When the\nmagnetization directions of the two F leads are different, the oblique-spin CAR\noccurs and its magnetoanisotropic period generally becomes 2\\pi instead of \\pi.\nIn the oblique-spin CAR process, the spins of the electron and hole are neither\nparallel nor antiparallel. Furthermore, the property of oblique-spin CAR is\nvery sensitive to the spin and valley degrees of freedom. The spin and valley\npolarized CAR can be achieved and controlled by the chemical potentials and the\nmagnetization directions.",

However, concerns have\nbeen raised that NEPs may hinder improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) of sensors, and there is currently no rigorous theoretical framework to\ncharacterize noise effects in NEPs, particularly when accounting for the\ninherent nonlinear feedback. Here, we develop a new theoretical framework to\naddress the impact of noise on NEP-based sensors, effectively resolving these\nconcerns. The interplay between noise and nonlinearity keeps the average\nfrequency virtually unchanged. In addition, a hidden feedback mechanism limits\nthe increase in detectable uncertainty, together enabling a substantial SNR\nenhancement at NEPs. Our results resolve the ongoing debate over the SNR of\nNEPs and lay the groundwork for NEP-based sensor technologies.",

An equation\nfor the fluid flow rate Q is derived and used to describe analytically the flux\nof ions, and local potentials and concentrations. This equation, which allows\nto treat the diffusio-osmotic problems without tedious and time consuming\ncomputations, clarifies that the global flow rate is controlled only by the\nsurface charge and concentration drop between the channel ends, and indicates\nthat there always exist two different values of {\\sigma} that correspond to a\nparticular Q.

The PDE robustly exhibits a subcritical Turing\nbifurcation that, in this limit, is labeled as a singular Turing bifurcation.\nWe show that families of spatially-periodic canard solutions emerge from this\nsubcritical singular Turing bifurcation. Then, right after they emerge, the\nsolutions lose their purely sinusoidal structure ($e^{ik_Tx}$, where $k_T$ is\nthe critical wavenumber at the Turing bifurcation) and gain a distinct\nmulti-scale spatial structure. They consist of segments along which the\ncomponents vary gradually in space, interspersed with short intervals on which\nthe activator component exhibits pulses and steep gradients. The branches of\nthese spatially-periodic canards undergo a saddle-node bifurcation. Some of the\nlarge-amplitude patterns on the upper branches are attractors of the PDE, and\nunstable patterns with small pulses that exist below the folds appear to guide\nthe evolution of data to the attractors. We also analyze the spatial ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) that govern time-independent solutions. We show\nthat the spatial ODE system has a folded singularity known as a reversible\nfolded saddle-node of type II (RFSN-II) point that coincides with the Turing\nbifurcation in the singular limit. We demonstrate that, for parameter values\nclose to the Turing bifurcation, the true and faux canards of the RFSN-II point\nare responsible for generating the spatially-periodic canards, and for\nparameter values away from the Turing value there is a reversible folded saddle\npoint whose true and faux canards generate the spatially-periodic canard\nsolutions. Overall, we identify the RFSN-II and RFS folded singularities and\ntheir canards as new selection mechanisms for subcritical bifurcations.",

In this paper, we present\nTemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system\ndesigned to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation\nof temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach\nleverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial\nconditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images.

To bridge the gap between\nlatent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate\nrepresentative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are\nused as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates\nnatural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The\nsystem also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case\nretrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth\nanalysis.

It consists of a feedback-driven frequency controller\nthat dynamically adapts GPU frequency for prefill and decode phases, and a\nstate-space router that explores routing decisions across frequency-scaled\ninstances to minimize energy under latency constraints. We implement VoltanaLLM\nin SGLang and evaluate its performance over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and\nreal-world datasets. The results demonstrate that VoltanaLLM achieves up to\n36.3% energy savings while maintaining near-perfect SLO attainment rate, paving\nthe way for sustainable and intelligent LLM serving.",

    "abstract": "We study a one-dimensional system of strongly interacting anyons with\nshort-range interactions under external confinement. This system, referred to\nas $p$-wave anyons, interpolates continuously between spin-polarized fermions\nwith $p$-wave interactions and free bosons. At zero temperature, the\ncorrelation functions decay exponentially with distance, with oscillations\ngoverned by the statistics parameter. The decay rate is maximal for $p$-wave\nfermions and decreases monotonically as the statistics parameter approaches the\nbosonic limit, where it vanishes. The momentum distribution is asymmetric, a\nhallmark of one-dimensional anyons, and takes the form of a shifted Lorentzian\nwith universal power-law tails, $\\lim_{k \\to \\pm \\infty} n(k)\\sim C/k^2$. We\nprove analytically that, following release from a harmonic trap, the asymptotic\nmomentum distribution converges to that of free bosons in the same trap, a\nphenomenon known as dynamical bosonization. We also establish the universality\nof the groundstate $n$-particle reduced density matrices: their natural\noccupations are independent of the confining potential, while the associated\nnatural $n$-functions for different confinements are related through a simple\nanalytical transformation. In particular, for the one-particle reduced density\nmatrix, we derive exact expressions for both the natural occupations and the\nnatural orbitals at arbitrary particle number. These results extend and unify\nearlier partial findings for $p$-wave fermions, and they provide a clear\nconceptual explanation of the double degeneracy observed in their spectrum.",

A previous method\ncalibrated with simulation data exists to recover the 3D turbulent velocity\ndispersion from PPV data. However, that method relies on optically-thin\nconditions, ignoring any radiative transfer (RT) and chemical effects. In the\npresent study we determine how opacity, RT, and chemical effects influence\nturbulence measurements with CO lines. We post-process a chemo-dynamical\nsimulation of a turbulent collapsing cloud with a non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium line RT code to generate PPV spectral cubes of the CO (1-0) and CO\n(2-1) lines, and obtain moment maps. We isolate the turbulence in the\nfirst-moment maps by using a Gaussian smoothing approach. We compare the CO\nresults with the optically-thin scenario to explore how line excitation and RT\nimpact the turbulence measurements. We find that the turbulent velocity\ndispersion (sigma_v) measured via CO requires a correction by a factor R_CO,\nwith R_CO,1-0 = 0.88 (+0.09, -0.08) for the CO (1-0) line and R_CO,2-1 = 0.88\n(+0.10, -0.08) for the CO (2-1) line.

The\nmodel struggles more with novel forms of unproductive and less productive\nclasses, and performs far better for unseen forms belonging to productive\nclasses.

We address this challenge by leveraging Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to translate code changes from well-resourced languages\ninto equivalent changes in underrepresented or emerging languages, generating\nsynthetic training data where labelled examples are scarce.

To\novercome this, we use LLMs to generate synthetic change examples and train\nsupervised classifiers on them. We systematically compare the performance of\nthese classifiers against models trained on real labelled data. Our experiments\nacross multiple GitHub repositories and language pairs demonstrate that\nLLM-generated synthetic data can effectively bootstrap review recommendation\nsystems, narrowing the performance gap even in low-resource settings.

First, the continuous growth in qubit counts has rendered\ndistributed QCA inevitable, yet the nondeterministic latencies inherent in\nfeedback loops demand cycleaccurate synchronization across multiple\ncontrollers. Existing synchronization strategies -- whether lock-step or\ndemand-driven -- introduce significant performance penalties. Second, existing\nquantum instruction set architectures are polarized, being either too abstract\nor too granular. This lack of a unifying design necessitates recurrent hardware\ncustomization for each new control requirement, which limits the system's\nreconfigurability and impedes the path toward a scalable and unified digital\nmicroarchitecture.\n  Addressing these challenges, we propose Distributed-HISQ, featuring: (i)\nHISQ, A universal instruction set that redefines quantum control with a\nhardware-agnostic design. By decoupling from quantum operation semantics, HISQ\nprovides a unified language for control sequences, enabling a single\nmicroarchitecture to support various control methods and enhancing system\nreconfigurability.

This\npaper therefore asks: has the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 ultimately made\nresidential networks more vulnerable to attack, thereby empowering the next\ngeneration of IPv6-based IoT botnets? To answer this question, we introduce a\nlarge-scale IPv6 scanning methodology that, unlike those that rely on AI, can\nbe run on low-resource devices common in IoT botnets. We use this methodology\nto perform the largest-scale measurement of IPv6 residential networks to date,\nand compare which devices are publicly accessible to comparable IPv4 networks.\nWe were able to receive responses from 14.0M distinct IPv6 addresses inside of\nresidential networks (i.e., not the external-facing gateway), in 2,436 ASes\nacross 118 countries. These responses come from protocols commonly exploited by\nIoT botnets (including telnet and FTP), as well as protocols typically\nassociated with end-user devices (including iPhone-Sync and IPP).

Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a\ndedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models\nautoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and\n(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal\ngate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights\ninto a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range\ndependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments\non widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the\nsignificant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern\ndeep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.",

    "abstract": "When given the option, will LLMs choose to leave the conversation (bail)? We\ninvestigate this question by giving models the option to bail out of\ninteractions using three different bail methods: a bail tool the model can\ncall, a bail string the model can output, and a bail prompt that asks the model\nif it wants to leave. On continuations of real world data (Wildchat and\nShareGPT), all three of these bail methods find models will bail around\n0.28-32\\% of the time (depending on the model and bail method). However, we\nfind that bail rates can depend heavily on the model used for the transcript,\nwhich means we may be overestimating real world bail rates by up to 4x. If we\nalso take into account false positives on bail prompt (22\\%), we estimate real\nworld bail rates range from 0.06-7\\%, depending on the model and bail method.\nWe use observations from our continuations of real world data to construct a\nnon-exhaustive taxonomy of bail cases, and use this taxonomy to construct\nBailBench: a representative synthetic dataset of situations where some models\nbail. We test many models on this dataset, and observe some bail behavior\noccurring for most of them. Bail rates vary substantially between models, bail\nmethods, and prompt wordings. Finally, we study the relationship between\nrefusals and bails. We find: 1) 0-13\\% of continuations of real world\nconversations resulted in a bail without a corresponding refusal 2) Jailbreaks\ntend to decrease refusal rates, but increase bail rates 3) Refusal abliteration\nincreases no-refuse bail rates, but only for some bail methods 4) Refusal rate\non BailBench does not appear to predict bail rate.",

In particular, we consider two cases when the IRSs'\nreflective beamforming optimization can be implemented dynamically in real time\nand quasi-stationarily over the whole operation period, respectively. For both\ncases, the joint IRS deployment and transmit/reflective beamforming designs are\nformulated as mixed-integer non-convex optimization problems, which are solved\nvia the successive convex approximation (SCA)-based relax-and-bound method.\nSpecifically, we first relax the binary IRS deployment indicators into\ncontinuous variables, then find converged solutions via SCA, and finally round\nrelaxed indicators back to binary values. Numerical results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed algorithms in reducing the system cost while\nmeeting the sensing and communication requirements.",

Here we introduce\na control strategy for fast entangling gates in a scalable fluxonium\narchitecture, utilizing parametric modulation of the plasmon interaction. In\nthis architecture, fluxoniums are coupled via a tunable coupler, whose\ntransition frequency is flux-modulated to control the inter-fluxonium plasmon\ninteraction. A bSWAP-type interaction is activated by parametrically driving\nthe coupler at the sum frequency of the plasmon transitions of the two\nfluxoniums, resulting in the simultaneous excitation or de-excitation of both\nplasmon modes. This strategy therefore allow the transitions between\ncomputational states and non-computational plasmon states, enabling the\naccumulation of conditional phases on the computational subspace and\nfacilitating the realization of controlled-phase gates. By focusing on a\nspecific case of these bSWAP-type interactions, we show that a simple drive\npulse enables sub-100ns CZ gates with an error below $10^{-4}$.

The spin MOSFET device has an 8-nm-thick p-Si channel with a back\ngate (G) and ferromagnetic source / drain (S/D) junctions consisting of\nFe/Mg/MgO/SiOx/n+-Si. In addition to transistor characteristics with an on-off\nratio of 104, clear spin-valve signals and Hanle spin precession signals were\nobserved at 4 K in a wide range of the source-to-gate V_GS and source-to-drain\nV_DS bias voltages.

In this work, we experimentally demonstrate\nsmoothing scenarios, using an optical parametric oscillator and introducing\n`observed' and `unobserved' channels by splitting the output beam into two\nindependent homodyne detectors. We achieve improvement in state purification of\n10.3% +/- 1.6%, squeezing restoration of 7.6% +/- 2.6%, and show that smoothed\nstates are better estimates of hidden true states than those from conventional\nfiltering. The estimation techniques used in this paper are promising for many\napplications in quantum information that incorporate post-processing.",

Traditional interest\nmodeling methods often rely on unimodal data, such as click logs or text\nlabels, which limits their ability to fully capture user preferences in a\ncomplex multimodal content environment. To address this challenge, this paper\nproposes a multimodal foundation model-based framework for user interest\nmodeling and behavior analysis. By integrating video frames, textual\ndescriptions, and background music into a unified semantic space using\ncross-modal alignment strategies, the framework constructs fine-grained user\ninterest vectors. Additionally, we introduce a behavior-driven feature\nembedding mechanism that incorporates viewing, liking, and commenting sequences\nto model dynamic interest evolution, thereby improving both the timeliness and\naccuracy of recommendations. In the experimental phase, we conduct extensive\nevaluations using both public and proprietary short video datasets, comparing\nour approach against multiple mainstream recommendation algorithms and modeling\ntechniques. Results demonstrate significant improvements in behavior prediction\naccuracy, interest modeling for cold-start users, and recommendation\nclick-through rates.

While upstream (pay-it-forward: helping others because you\nwere helped) and downstream (rewarding-reputation: helping those with good\nreputations) indirect reciprocity have been independently considered as\nsolutions, their joint dynamics in multiplayer contexts remain unexplored. We\nstudy N-player giving games with benefit b and cost c and analyze evolutionary\ndynamics for three strategies: unconditional cooperation (X), unconditional\ndefection (Y), and an integrated reciprocal strategy (Z) combining\nunconditional forwarding with reputation-based discrimination. We show that\nintegrating upstream and downstream reciprocity can yield a globally\nasymptotically stable mixed equilibrium of unconditional defectors and\nintegrated reciprocators whenever the benefit-to-cost ratio exceeds a threshold\n(b/c > 2). Counterintuitively, introducing small complexity costs, rather than\ndestabilizing, stabilizes the equilibrium by preventing not only unconditional\ncooperators (viewed as second-order freeloaders) but also alternative\nconditional strategies from invading. While the equilibrium frequency of\nintegrated reciprocators decreases with group size N, it remains positive for\nany finite N. Rather than requiring uniformity, our model reveals one pathway\nto stable cooperation through strategic diversity. Defectors serve as\n\"evolutionary shields\" preventing system collapse while integrated\nreciprocators flexibly combine open and discriminative responses.

By increasing the\nwing width of a cavity with special geometry symmetry, the interference\nproperty allows us to exponentially improves the quality factor Q without\naltering the mode volume V for cavities supporting subwavelength light modes.\nThis effectively overcomes the trade-off between Q and V in conventional\nsubwavelength Fabry-Perot cavities.

    "abstract": "The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents\na critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has\nfocused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,\nexplicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,\nlong-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents\ntrained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but\nstructurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces\nand sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in\ndeveloping capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an\nexplicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved\nthrough hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into\nstructured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of\n2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend\ntowards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly\nconstruct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a\nparadigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this\nhierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model\non the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,\ndense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional\nlearning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors\nwith far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,\nlanguage-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level\nreactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and\ngeneralizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.",

    "abstract": "Charge order in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits a complex\nthree-dimensional organization and intermediate-temperature anomalies whose\nbulk character has remained unsettled. We use orientation-dependent $^{51}$V\nNMR as a site-selective probe to determine the stacking of the charge density\nwave (CDW) state and its thermal evolution. Below\n$T_{\\mathrm{CDW}}\\!\\approx\\!94$~K, the field-linear splitting of the $^{51}$V\ncentral transition together with the anisotropy of the Knight-shift tensor\nidentify an interlayer-modulated $3\\mathbf{q}$ CDW whose local environments are\nconsistent with a four-layer $2\\times2\\times4$ stacking with mixed\ntrihexagonal/Star-of-David distortions, in agreement with synchrotron x-ray\ndeterminations. For comparison, RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ serves as a reference exhibiting\na uniform trihexagonal $2\\times2\\times2$ stacking, allowing us to isolate\nfeatures unique to the $2\\times2\\times4$ state in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. With\n$\\mathbf{H}_0\\!\\parallel\\!c$, the $^{51}$V quadrupolar satellites through the\nintermediate temperature scale near $T_{\\mathrm{CO}}\\!\\approx\\!65$ K reorganize\ninto two well-resolved electric-field-gradient manifolds that coexist over a\nfinite interval; their relative spectral weights interchange on cooling while\nthe total integrated satellite intensity remains conserved and $\\nu_Q$ within\neach manifold is nearly temperature independent. The coexistence without\ncritical broadening, together with conserved intensity, provides bulk evidence\nconsistent with a first-order charge-order transition near $T_{\\mathrm{CO}}$.\nOur measurements do not resolve whether this lower-temperature transition\ncorresponds to a distinct in-plane order or a reorganization of the\n$3\\mathbf{q}$ state; rather, they delimit this window and provide bulk,\nsite-resolved constraints that connect prior reported anomalies to a\nthermodynamic first-order transition.",

    "abstract": "I examine recent radio observations of the supernova remnant (SNR) RCW 89 and\nidentify a point-symmetric morphology composed of two main symmetry axes. I\nattribute this morphology to a jet-driven explosion in the framework of the\njittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). To reach this conclusion, I argue\nthat the MSH 15-52 nebula associated with the pulsar PSR B1509-58, the X-ray\nhand-like-shaped nebula, and RCW 89 are two separate core-collapse supernova\n(CCSN) remnants that interact with each other. Namely, the nebula SNR\nG320.4-1.2 contains two CCSN remnants. In essence, I utilize the recent\nsuccesses of the JJEM to account for the morphologies of point-symmetric CCSN\nremnants, thereby explaining the morphology of RCW 89 and identifying it as a\nseparate CCSN remnant. I suggest a process by which somewhat more energetic\npairs of jets in the JJEM have a positive feedback on the accreted gas onto the\nnewly born neutron star, thereby prolonging the life of the jets and explaining\nthe occurrence of two or three energetic pairs of jets in some CCSNe. This\nstudy adds RCW 89 to the growing list of point-symmetric CCSN remnants. The\nJJEM naturally explains these morphologies as shaped by misaligned pairs of\njets that exploded these CCSNe.",

In the proposed framework the high-level step\nplanner runs at 40 Hz and the mid-level MPC at 500 Hz using the onboard\nmini-PC.

However, existing diffusion parallelism\ninference schemes often underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU\nenvironments, where varying hardware capabilities or background tasks cause\nworkload imbalance. This paper introduces Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion\nInference (STADI), a novel framework to accelerate diffusion model inference in\nsuch settings. At its core is a hybrid scheduler that orchestrates fine-grained\nparallelism across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Temporally, STADI\nintroduces a novel computation-aware step allocator applied after warmup\nphases, using a least-common-multiple-minimizing quantization technique to\nreduce denoising steps on slower GPUs and execution synchronization. To further\nminimize GPU idle periods, STADI executes an elastic patch parallelism\nmechanism that allocates variably sized image patches to GPUs according to\ntheir computational capability, ensuring balanced workload distribution through\na complementary spatial mechanism. Extensive experiments on both\nload-imbalanced and heterogeneous multi-GPU clusters validate STADI's efficacy,\ndemonstrating improved load balancing and mitigation of performance\nbottlenecks. Compared to patch parallelism, a state-of-the-art diffusion\ninference framework, our method significantly reduces end-to-end inference\nlatency by up to 45% and significantly improves resource utilization on\nheterogeneous GPUs.",

    "abstract": "Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the\noptimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order\noptimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly\nreshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral\nFusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and\ninformation fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core\nprinciples: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically\nbalances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting\nfrequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or\ntraining pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the\nsecond-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and\nimplement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that\nadaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative\nexponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens\nspectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early\ndecision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains\nhigh. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and\nfixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test\nerror and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches\nbaseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF\nreveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a\nunified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.",
