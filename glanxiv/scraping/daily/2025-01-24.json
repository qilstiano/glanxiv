    "abstract": "Set function learning has emerged as a crucial area in machine learning,\naddressing the challenge of modeling functions that take sets as inputs. Unlike\ntraditional machine learning that involves fixed-size input vectors where the\norder of features matters, set function learning demands methods that are\ninvariant to permutations of the input set, presenting a unique and complex\nproblem. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current\ndevelopment in set function learning, covering foundational theories, key\nmethodologies, and diverse applications. We categorize and discuss existing\napproaches, focusing on deep learning approaches, such as DeepSets and Set\nTransformer based methods, as well as other notable alternative methods beyond\ndeep learning, offering a complete view of current models. We also introduce\nvarious applications and relevant datasets, such as point cloud processing and\nmulti-label classification, highlighting the significant progress achieved by\nset function learning methods in these domains. Finally, we conclude by\nsummarizing the current state of set function learning approaches and\nidentifying promising future research directions, aiming to guide and inspire\nfurther advancements in this promising field.",

This paper introduces an equivalent but\nmore explicit definition of the risk envelope that uses gauge sets (i.e., a\ntype of convex sets widely utilized in convex analysis and gauge optimization)\nto provide a generalized measure of distance between any reweighting function\nand the nominal one. Using the primal gauge set reweighting problem, we provide\na unified framework for various existing methods in optimization under\nuncertainty, including risk-neutral/risk-averse stochastic programming, robust\noptimization, and distributionally robust optimization with moment-based and\ndistance-based ambiguity sets. On the other hand, the associated dual problem\noffers an intuitive interpretation from the regularization perspective. This\napproach not only simplifies the derivation of classic results but also\nprovides a versatile framework for robustness design via manipulations of the\ngauge sets (e.g., intersection, union, summation, convex combination, and\nfunction basis enforcement). To demonstrate this flexibility, we present\napproaches for customizing robustness to specific managerial needs, including\nmethods for selecting flexible tail behaviors, addressing spatial\ndistributional ambiguities, combining multiple robustness metrics, and\nachieving heterogeneous distributional robustness. We also discuss general\nreformulation techniques and computational approaches for this unified\nframework.",

    "abstract": "The detection of a gravitational wave background in the nano-Hertz frequency\nrange from Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations offers new insights into\nevolution of the early universe. In this work we analyze gravitational wave\ndata from PPTA, EPTA, and NANOGrav, as arising from a supercooled first-order\nphase transition within a hidden sector, characterized by a broken $U(1)_X$\ngauge symmetry. Several previous works have discussed challenges in producing\nobservable {PTA signal} from supercooled phases transitions. We discuss these\nchallenges and show how they are overcome by inclusion in part of the proper\nthermal history of the hidden and the visible sectors. The analysis of this\nwork demonstrates that thermal histories of hidden and visible sectors\nprofoundly influence the gravitational wave power spectrum, an aspect not\npreviously explored in the literature. Further, the analysis of this work\nsuggests that supercooled phase transitions not only align with the Pulsar\nTiming Array observations but also show promise for gravitational wave\ndetection by future gravitational wave detectors. Our analysis shows that the\ndominant contribution to the gravitational wave power spectrum for PTA signals\ncomes from bubble collision while the sound wave and turbulence contributions\nare highly suppressed. It is also found that all the PTA events are of\ndetonation type while deflagration and hybrid events are absent. The analysis\npresented in this work provides a robust framework for further investigations\non the origin of gravitational wave power spectrum in the early universe and\nfor their experimental observation in the future.",

To help OSS identify vulnerability fix commits,\nseveral automated approaches are developed. However, existing approaches like\nVulFixMiner and CoLeFunDa, focus solely on code changes, neglecting essential\ncontext from development artifacts. Tools like Vulcurator, which integrates\nissue reports, fail to leverage semantic associations between different\ndevelopment artifacts (e.g., pull requests and history vulnerability fixes).\nMoreover, they miss vulnerability fixes in tangled commits and lack\nexplanations, limiting practical use. Hence to address those limitations, we\npropose LLM4VFD, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)\nenhanced with Chain-of-Thought reasoning and In-Context Learning to improve the\naccuracy of vulnerability fix detection. LLM4VFD comprises three components:\n(1) Code Change Intention, which analyzes commit summaries, purposes, and\nimplications using Chain-of-Thought reasoning; (2) Development Artifact, which\nincorporates context from related issue reports and pull requests; (3)\nHistorical Vulnerability, which retrieves similar past vulnerability fixes to\nenrich context. More importantly, on top of the prediction, LLM4VFD also\nprovides a detailed analysis and explanation to help security experts\nunderstand the rationale behind the decision. We evaluated LLM4VFD against\nstate-of-the-art techniques, including Pre-trained Language Model-based\napproaches and vanilla LLMs, using a newly collected dataset, BigVulFixes.\nExperimental results demonstrate that LLM4VFD significantly outperforms the\nbest-performed existing approach by 68.1%--145.4%.

These behaviors are known to be affected\nby, among others, the intensity of the incident light, the aspect ratios of\ncrystal geometries, and the volume changes accompanying phase transformation.\nWhile these factors, individually, explain the increase in internal energy of\nthe system and its subsequent minimization through macroscopic deformation,\nthey do not fully explain the diversity of deformations observed in molecular\ncrystals. Here, we propose a micromechanical model based on the Cauchy-Born\nrule and photoreaction theory to predict the macroscopic response in molecular\ncrystals. By accounting for lattice geometry changes and microstructural\npatterns that emerge during phase transformation, we predict a range of\ndeformations in a representative molecular crystal (salicylideneamine). Doing\nso, we find that the interplay between photoexcited states and the energy\nminimization pathways, across a multi-well energy landscape, is crucial to the\nbending and twisting deformations. We use our model to analyze the role of\nparticle geometries and the intensity of incident light on macroscopic\ndeformation, and identify geometric regimes for shearing and twisting\ndeformations in salicylideneamine crystals. Our micromechanical model is\ngeneral and can be adapted to predict photomechanical deformation in other\nmolecular crystals undergoing a solid-to-solid phase change and has potential\nas a computational design tool to engineer reversible and controllable\nactuation in molecular crystals.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the problem of automatic link selection in\nmulti-channel multiple access control using bandit feedback. In particular, a\ncontroller assigns multiple users to multiple channels in a time slotted\nsystem, where in each time slot at most one user can be assigned to a given\nchannel and at most one channel can be assigned to a given user. Given that\nuser $i$ is assigned to channel $j$, the transmission fails with a fixed\nprobability $f_{i,j}$. The failure probabilities are not known to the\ncontroller. The assignments are made dynamically using success/failure\nfeedback. The goal is to maximize the time average utility, where we consider\nan arbitrary (possibly nonsmooth) concave and entrywise nondecreasing utility\nfunction. The problem of merely maximizing the total throughput has a solution\nof always assigning the same user-channel pairs and can be unfair to certain\nusers, particularly when the number of channels is less than the number of\nusers. Instead, our scheme allows various types of fairness, such as\nproportional fairness, maximizing the minimum, or combinations of these by\ndefining the appropriate utility function. We propose two algorithms for this\ntask. The first algorithm is adaptive and gets within\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log(T)/T^{1/3})$ of optimality over any interval of $T$\nconsecutive slots over which the success probabilities do not change.

Recently, helium (He) ion irradiation was shown to be a\npromising method to enhance SNSPD performance. Here, we study how changes in\nthe underlying superconducting NbTiN film and the SiO2/Si substrate affect\ndevice performance. While irradiated and unirradiated NbTiN films show similar\ncrystallinity, we observe He bubble formation below the SiO2/Si interface and\nan amorphization of the Si substrate. Both reduce the thermal conductance\nbetween the superconducting thin film and the substrate from 210 W/m^2/K^4 to\n70 W/m^2/K^4 after irradiation with 2000 ions/nm^2. This effect, combined with\nthe lateral straggle of He ions in the substrate, allows the modification of\nthe superconductor-to-substrate thermal conductance of an SNSPD by selectively\nirradiating the regions around the nanowire. With this approach, we achieved an\nincreased plateau width of saturating intrinsic detection efficiency of 9.8 uA\ncompared to 3.7 uA after full irradiation. Moreover, the critical current\nremained similar to that of the unirradiated reference device (59 uA versus\n60.1 uA), while full irradiation reduced it to 22.4 uA. Our results suggest\nthat the irradiation-induced reduction of the thermal conductance significantly\nenhances SNSPD sensitivity, offering a novel approach to locally engineer\nsubstrate properties for improved detector performance.",

    "abstract": "Power distribution networks are evolving due to the integration of DERs and\nincreased customer participation. To maintain optimal operation, minimize\nlosses, and meet varying load demands, frequent network reconfiguration is\nnecessary. Traditionally, the reconfiguration task relies on optimization\nsoftware and expert operators, but as systems grow more complex, faster and\nmore adaptive solutions are required without expert intervention. Data-driven\nreconfiguration is gaining traction for its accuracy, speed, and robustness\nagainst incomplete network data. LLMs, with their ability to capture complex\npatterns, offer a promising approach for efficient and responsive network\nreconfiguration in evolving complex power networks.\n  In this work, we introduce LLM4DistReconfig, a deep learning-based approach\nutilizing a fine-tuned LLM to solve the distribution network reconfiguration\nproblem. By carefully crafting prompts and designing a custom loss function, we\ntrain the LLM with inputs representing network parameters such as buses,\navailable lines, open lines, node voltages, and system loss. The model then\npredicts optimal reconfigurations by outputting updated network configurations\nthat minimize system loss while meeting operational constraints. Our approach\nsignificantly reduces inference time compared to classical algorithms, allowing\nfor near real-time optimal reconfiguration after training. Experimental results\nshow that our method generates optimal configurations minimizing system loss\nfor five individual and a combined test dataset. It also produces minimal\ninvalid edges, no cycles, or subgraphs across all datasets, fulfilling\ndomain-specific needs. Additionally, the generated responses contain less than\n5% improper outputs on seen networks and satisfactory results on unseen\nnetworks, demonstrating its effectiveness and reliability for the\nreconfiguration task.",

We propose a novel\ncircuit partitioning method that leverages graph partitioning to optimize both\nqubit and gate teleportation, minimizing the required Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\n(EPR) pairs for executing general quantum circuits. Additionally, we formulate\nan integer linear program to further reduce entanglement requirements by\nmapping the logical resources of partitioned circuits to the physical\nconstraints of the quantum network. Finally, we analyze the entanglement cost\nof implementing the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) across multiple QPUs,\nexploiting the circuit's structure to minimize total entanglement consumption.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful tools for nonlinear classification in\nwhich latent GPs are combined with link functions. But GPs do not scale well to\nlarge training data. This is compounded for classification where the latent GPs\nrequire Markov chain Monte Carlo integration. Consequently, fully Bayesian,\nsampling-based approaches had been largely abandoned. Instead,\nmaximization-based alternatives, such as Laplace/variational inference (VI)\ncombined with low rank approximations, are preferred. Though feasible for large\ntraining data sets, such schemes sacrifice uncertainty quantification and\nmodeling fidelity, two aspects that are important to our work on surrogate\nmodeling of computer simulation experiments. Here we are motivated by a large\nscale simulation of binary black hole (BBH) formation. We propose an\nalternative GP classification framework which uses elliptical slice sampling\nfor Bayesian posterior integration and Vecchia approximation for computational\nthrift. We demonstrate superiority over VI-based alternatives for BBH\nsimulations and other benchmark classification problems. We then extend our\nsetup to warped inputs for \"deep\" nonstationary classification.",

    "abstract": "Establishing correspondences across images is a fundamental challenge in\ncomputer vision, underpinning tasks like Structure-from-Motion, image editing,\nand point tracking. Traditional methods are often specialized for specific\ncorrespondence types, geometric, semantic, or temporal, whereas humans\nnaturally identify alignments across these domains. Inspired by this\nflexibility, we propose MATCHA, a unified feature model designed to ``rule them\nall'', establishing robust correspondences across diverse matching tasks.\nBuilding on insights that diffusion model features can encode multiple\ncorrespondence types, MATCHA augments this capacity by dynamically fusing\nhigh-level semantic and low-level geometric features through an attention-based\nmodule, creating expressive, versatile, and robust features. Additionally,\nMATCHA integrates object-level features from DINOv2 to further boost\ngeneralization, enabling a single feature capable of matching anything.\nExtensive experiments validate that MATCHA consistently surpasses\nstate-of-the-art methods across geometric, semantic, and temporal matching\ntasks, setting a new foundation for a unified approach for the fundamental\ncorrespondence problem in computer vision. To the best of our knowledge, MATCHA\nis the first approach that is able to effectively tackle diverse matching tasks\nwith a single unified feature.",

    "abstract": "The Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension is one of the biggest challenges in\nmodern cosmology. This consists of the discrepancy, at around $5\\sigma$,\nbetween the local value of $H_0$ measured through Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia)\nconstrained with the Cepheids and the value inferred from the observations of\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by Planck data. According to the most\nappealing cosmological models, such as the flat $\\Lambda$CDM, the $H_0$ should\nnot vary according to the measurement method or the redshift $z$ of the probe\nused for estimating it. Thus, many ideas have been proposed in the literature\nto face this tension. In the current work, we summarize the results obtained\nwith the binned analysis of SNe Ia, showing a decreasing trend for $H_0$ with\n$z$ with an evolutionary coefficient $\\eta \\sim 0.01$, and we further discuss\nthe impact of high-$z$ probes such as Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) and quasars\n(QSOs) that allow reaching constraints on the cosmological parameters that will\nextend the Hubble diagram to high-$z$ values.",

To accomplish this, we first eliminate\ninter-replica communication. Instead, clients send transactions directly to all\nreplicas, which independently process transactions and append them to local\nlogs. Replicas assigns a timestamp and a sequence number to each transaction in\ntheir logs, allowing clients to extract valuable metadata about the\ntransactions and the system state. Later on, clients retrieve these logs and\nextract transactions (and associated metadata) from them. Necessarily, this\nconstruction achieves weaker properties than a total-order broadcast protocol,\ndue to existing lower bounds.

Effective\ngrid topology control requires advanced tools capable of handling\nmulti-objective trade-offs. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a\npromising framework for tackling such challenges, existing Multi-Objective\nReinforcement Learning (MORL) approaches fail to scale to the large state and\naction spaces inherent in real-world grid operations. Here we present a\ntwo-phase, efficient and scalable Multi-Objective Optimisation (MOO) method\ndesigned for grid topology control, combining an efficient RL learning phase\nwith a rapid planning phase to generate day-ahead plans for unseen scenarios.\nWe validate our approach using historical data from TenneT, a European\nTransmission System Operator (TSO), demonstrating minimal deployment time,\ngenerating day-ahead plans within 4-7 minutes with strong performance. These\nresults underline the potential of our scalable method to support real-world\npower grid management, offering a practical, computationally efficient, and\ntime-effective tool for operational planning. Based on current congestion costs\nand inefficiencies in grid operations, adopting our approach by TSOs could\npotentially save millions of euros annually, providing a compelling economic\nincentive for its integration in the control room.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac anatomy segmentation is useful for clinical assessment of cardiac\nmorphology to inform diagnosis and intervention. Deep learning (DL), especially\nwith motion information, has improved segmentation accuracy. However, existing\ntechniques for motion enhancement are not yet optimal, and they have high\ncomputational costs due to increased dimensionality or reduced robustness due\nto suboptimal approaches that use non-DL motion registration, non-attention\nmodels, or single-headed attention. They further have limited adaptability and\nare inconvenient for incorporation into existing networks where motion\nawareness is desired. Here, we propose a novel, computationally efficient\nTemporal Attention Module (TAM) that offers robust motion enhancement, modeled\nas a small, multi-headed, cross-temporal attention module. TAM's uniqueness is\nthat it is a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be inserted into a\nbroad range of segmentation networks (CNN-based, Transformer-based, or hybrid)\nfor motion enhancement without requiring substantial changes in the network's\nbackbone. This feature enables high adaptability and ease of integration for\nenhancing both existing and future networks. Extensive experiments on multiple\n2D and 3D cardiac ultrasound and MRI datasets confirm that TAM consistently\nimproves segmentation across a range of networks while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency and improving on currently reported performance.

These intensities provide valuable information about particle\nacceleration, the effects of bulk plasma dynamics on particle transport, and\nthe anisotropy of particle distributions. Since measured intensities are\ntypically reported in narrow energy bins, it is common to re-bin intensities\nover a wider energy range to improve counting statistics. We investigate two\nmethods for calculating intensities across multiple energy bins: a)\n\\textit{re-binned intensity} (\\(\\overline{j}_{\\rm linlin}\\)), which is\ncalculated by integrating the intensity over energy space and corresponds to\nthe intensity at an effective energy that depends on the time-varying spectral\nindex, and b) \\textit{spectral binned intensity} (\\(\\overline{j}_{\\rm\nloglog}\\)), calculated by integrating the log-intensity in log-energy space,\nyielding the intensity at the log-centered energy that is independent of the\nspectral index and remains constant over time. We compare these methods using\nParker Solar Probe (PSP) IS\\(\\odot\\)IS measurements of energetic protons, and\nwe prescribe criteria for selecting the appropriate method for different\nscenarios. Our results show that the re-binned intensity is consistently larger\n(up to a factor of 5) than the spectral binned intensity for two SEP events\nobserved by PSP, although the time series of the two methods are strongly\ncorrelated. Overall, both measures are important for SEP spectral analysis, and\nthe selection of the appropriate measure depends on whether a physical\n(spectral binned intensity) or a statistical (re-binned intensity)\nrepresentation is needed for a given analysis.",

To\novercome these barriers, researchers either assume that observations belong to\na finite-dimensional space spanned by basis functions or apply nonparametric\nsmoothing methods to the functions prior to clustering. Although extensive\nliterature describes clustering methods for functional data, few studies have\nexplored the clustering of measurement error--prone function-valued data. In\nthis work, we consider clustering methods for functional data prone to complex,\nheteroscedastic measurement errors. Two stage-based methods using mixed-effects\nmodels are first applied to adjust for measurement error bias, followed by\ncluster analysis of the measurement error--adjusted curves. Through\nsimulations, we investigate how varying sample size, the magnitude of\nmeasurement error, and the presence of complex heteroscedastic measurement\nerrors influence the cluster analysis of functional data. Our results indicate\nthat failing to account for measurement errors and the correlation structures\nassociated with frequently collected functional data reduces the accuracy of\nidentifying the true latent groups or clusters. The method consistently\nproduces better results regardless of the initial clustering values used.\nMoreover, it is flexible and can be applied to various clustering approaches,\nbased on the specific distribution of the data.

    "abstract": "Dynamic max-min fair allocation (DMMF) is a simple and popular mechanism for\nthe repeated allocation of a shared resource among competing agents: in each\nround, each agent can choose to request or not for the resource, which is then\nallocated to the requesting agent with the least number of allocations received\ntill then. Recent work has shown that under DMMF, a simple threshold-based\nrequest policy enjoys surprisingly strong robustness properties, wherein each\nagent can realize a significant fraction of her optimal utility irrespective of\nhow other agents' behave. While this goes some way in mitigating the\npossibility of a 'tragedy of the commons' outcome, the robust policies require\nthat an agent defend against arbitrary (possibly adversarial) behavior by other\nagents. This however may be far from optimal compared to real world settings,\nwhere other agents are selfish optimizers rather than adversaries. Therefore,\nrobust guarantees give no insight on how agents behave in an equilibrium, and\nwhether outcomes are improved under one.\n  Our work aims to bridge this gap by studying the existence and properties of\nequilibria under DMMF. To this end, we first show that despite the strong\nrobustness guarantees of the threshold based strategies, no Nash equilibrium\nexists when agents participate in DMMF, each using some fixed threshold-based\npolicy. On the positive side, however, we show that for the symmetric case, a\nsimple data-driven request policy guarantees that no agent benefits from\ndeviating to a different fixed threshold policy. In our proposed policy agents\naim to match the historical allocation rate with a vanishing drift towards the\nrate optimizing overall welfare for all users. Furthermore, the resulting\nequilibrium outcome can be significantly better compared to what follows from\nthe robustness guarantees.",

Realizations\nof such a framework are faced with several challenges that stem from the\nextreme scale of forward models and, in some cases, slow eigenvalue decay of\nthe parameter-to-observable map. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to\novercome these challenges by exploiting the autonomous structure of the forward\nmodel. As a result, we can move the PDE solutions, which dominate the cost for\nsolving the Bayesian inverse problem, to an offline computation and leverage\nthe high-performance dense linear algebra capabilities of GPUs to accelerate\nthe online prediction of quantities of interest. We seek to apply this\nframework to construct digital twins for the Cascadia subduction zone as a\nmeans of providing early warning for tsunamis generated by subduction zone\nmegathrust earthquakes. To that end, we demonstrate how our methodology can be\nused to employ seafloor pressure observations, along with the coupled\nacoustic-gravity wave equations, to infer the earthquake-induced seafloor\nmotion (discretized with $O(10^9)$ parameters) and forward predict the tsunami\npropagation.

    "abstract": "Time-dependent numerical studies of line-driven winds using the Sobolev\napproximation have a history spanning over three decades. In many of these\nstudies, the wind solutions display notorious oscillations. Two clues suggest\nthe oscillations originate at the wind base: (i) simulations reach a steady\nstate without oscillations when the base density is sufficiently low and (ii)\nthe oscillation dominant frequency is comparable to the Lamb cut-off frequency,\n{\\omega}c, of acoustic waves propagating in a stratified hydrostatic\natmosphere. Recently, Dannen et al. observed another clue: when the line force\nsignificantly weakens due to ionization, the winds become increasingly\nsensitive to the self-excited oscillations. Here, we present a set of\nsimulations and perturbation analyses that further elucidate the source and\ncharacteristics of oscillations. We found that the line force adds wave energy\nand amplifies perturbations with frequencies near {\\omega}c. This selective\namplification results from the coupling between the natural tendency of\nvelocity perturbations to grow in a stratified atmosphere and from the line\nforce dependence on the velocity gradient, per the Castor-Abbott-Klein\nline-driven wind theory. We also found that the variability stems from\nself-excitation that occurs in the exponential atmosphere due to the\nnon-linearity introduced by the absolute value of the velocity gradient in the\nline force prescription. We conclude that self-consistently calculating\nionization is insufficient for modeling the dynamics in the subsonic\natmosphere. Instead, future wind or unified models should relax the Sobolev\napproximation, or model the radiative transfer to properly capture the\nresulting radiation-induced instabilities and dynamics at the wind base.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, contrary to the early popular expectation that\nlarge-scale discourse in online communities would foster greater consensus, the\nlarge-scale structure of online discourse has been measured to be strongly\npolarized. Though it was posited that this effect was driven mainly by the\nalgorithmic curation of content by social platforms (the \"Filter Bubble\") it\nappears that polarization is mainly driven by the tendency of interactions\namong users to be homophilic; users strongly prefer to endorse content and\nother users that are similar to them. Users organize into homophilic clusters\nor \"echo chambers\" where interactions within clusters are more likely to be\npositive and interactions between clusters are more likely to be negative. This\nmotivates studying polarization in online discourse through modeling as an\nexample of self organized dynamics. Models of opinion formation on networks\nhave tended to only encode positive interactions (attraction) between users -\nas a consequence consensus or non-interacting clusters of users are ubiquitous\nbehaviors. In this research a model of network-based opinion formation is\nintroduced that includes a novel dynamic of negative interaction; instead of\nmodeling negative interaction as repulsion in the opinion space it is modeled\nas an attraction to a \"Doppelg\\\"anger\" user. It is demonstrated that this model\nexhibits rich behavior. Four distinct regimes of local interaction correspond\nto different population-wide dynamics - Neutral Consensus, Extreme Consensus,\nPolarization and Undecided. In the Polarization regime, local interactions are\nmodeled to be homophilic and the structure of discourse that emerges replicates\nwhat is seen in empirical data; clustered users where interactions within\nclusters is positive and interaction between clusters is negative.",

Previous works predominantly focused on either\nestimating poses(often at the instance level), or reconstructing shapes, but\nnot both. Glissando-Net is composed of two auto-encoders that are jointly\ntrained, one for RGB images and the other for point clouds. We embrace two key\ndesign choices in Glissando-Net to achieve a more accurate prediction of the 3D\nshape and pose of the object given a single RGB image as input. First, we\naugment the feature maps of the point cloud encoder and decoder with\ntransformed feature maps from the image decoder, enabling effective 2D-3D\ninteraction in both training and prediction. Second, we predict both the 3D\nshape and pose of the object in the decoder stage. This way, we better utilize\nthe information in the 3D point clouds presented only in the training stage to\ntrain the network for more accurate prediction. We jointly train the two\nencoder-decoders for RGB and point cloud data to learn how to pass latent\nfeatures to the point cloud decoder during inference. In testing, the encoder\nof the 3D point cloud is discarded. The design of Glissando-Net is inspired by\ncodeSLAM. Unlike codeSLAM, which targets 3D reconstruction of scenes, we focus\non pose estimation and shape reconstruction of objects, and directly predict\nthe object pose and a pose invariant 3D reconstruction without the need of the\ncode optimization step. Extensive experiments, involving both ablation studies\nand comparison with competing methods, demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed\nmethod, and compare favorably with the state-of-the-art.",

That may not always be possible. A stabilized explicit\nfinite difference scheme, marching backward in time, is developed and applied\nto nonlinear examples in non rectangular regions. Stabilization is achieved by\napplying a compensating smoothing operator at each time step, to quench the\ninstability. Analysis of convergence is restricted to the transparent case of\nlinear, autonomous, selfadjoint spatial differential operators. However, the\nactual computational scheme can be applied to more general problems. Data\nassimilation is illustrated using 512x512 pixel images.

However,\nexisting works suffer from three key limitations:1) overlooking differences\namong data samples leads to evaluation bias; 2) tailoring feature spaces to\nspecific machine learning models results in overfitting and poor\ngeneralization; 3) requiring the evaluator to be retrained from scratch during\neach optimization iteration significantly reduces the overall efficiency of the\noptimization process. To bridge these gaps, we propose a gEneralized Adaptive\nfeature Space Evaluator (EASE) to efficiently produce optimal and generalized\nfeature spaces. This framework consists of two key components: Feature-Sample\nSubspace Generator and Contextual Attention Evaluator. The first component aims\nto decouple the information distribution within the feature space to mitigate\nevaluation bias. To achieve this, we first identify features most relevant to\nprediction tasks and samples most challenging for evaluation based on feedback\nfrom the subsequent evaluator. This decoupling strategy makes the evaluator\nconsistently target the most challenging aspects of the feature space. The\nsecond component intends to incrementally capture evolving patterns of the\nfeature space for efficient evaluation. We propose a weighted-sharing\nmulti-head attention mechanism to encode key characteristics of the feature\nspace into an embedding vector for evaluation. Moreover, the evaluator is\nupdated incrementally, retaining prior evaluation knowledge while incorporating\nnew insights, as consecutive feature spaces during the optimization process\nshare partial information.

    "abstract": "Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent and potentially life-threatening\ndiseases worldwide, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis to improve\npatient outcomes. Conventional diagnostic methods, reliant on clinical\nexpertise and histopathological analysis, are often time-intensive, subjective,\nand prone to variability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\nhybrid deep learning framework that integrates convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks to achieve high classification\naccuracy and enhanced interpretability. The motivation for incorporating RBF\nNetworks lies in their intrinsic interpretability and localized response to\ninput features, which make them well-suited for tasks requiring transparency\nand fine-grained decision-making. Unlike traditional deep learning models that\nrely on global feature representations, RBF Networks allow for mapping segments\nof images to chosen prototypes, exploiting salient features within a single\nimage. This enables clinicians to trace predictions to specific, interpretable\npatterns. The framework incorporates segmentation-based feature extraction,\nactive learning for prototype selection, and K-Medoids clustering to focus on\nthese salient features. Evaluations on the ISIC 2016 and ISIC 2017 datasets\ndemonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving classification accuracies of\n83.02\\% and 72.15\\% using ResNet50, respectively, and outperforming VGG16-based\nconfigurations. By generating interpretable explanations for predictions, the\nframework aligns with clinical workflows, bridging the gap between predictive\nperformance and trustworthiness. This study highlights the potential of hybrid\nmodels to deliver actionable insights, advancing the development of reliable\nAI-assisted diagnostic tools for high-stakes medical applications.",

    "abstract": "Counterdiabatic driving, which enforces adiabatic evolution in arbitrary\ntimescales, can be realised by engineering a Floquet Hamiltonian which\noscillates between the Hamiltonian and its derivative requiring no additional\ncontrol terms. However, the coefficients of the Floquet Hamiltoinan require\nknowledge of the counterdiabatic terms, which can be difficult to derive\noutside of a limited set of examples. We introduce a new hybrid technique for\nthe control of quantum systems, Counterdiabatic-influenced Floquet-engineering\nor CAFFEINE for short. CAFFEINE parameterises the Floquet Hamiltonian for\ncounterdiabatic driving and utilises numerical quantum optimal control in order\nto obtain the desired target state. This removes the need to both obtain and\nimplement counterdiabatic terms, however, it does require the ability to\nquickly oscillate each term in the Hamiltonian. If this oscillation is\npossible, then CAFFEINE provides a framework to implement quantum annealing\nprotocols and general quantum state preparation. We illustrate this through\noptimisation of two numerical examples of preparing a Bell state with two\nqubits and performing annealing protocols for the one-dimensional Ising model.\nBeyond this, we also illustrate CAFFEINE's capabilities to learn the\ncounterdiabatic terms, which can potentially be used as a probe of quantum\nchaos and the geometry of quantum dynamics.",

To this end, we use string theory as a\nlaboratory and argue that such EFTs should exhibit a $\\textit{double EFT\nexpansion}$ involving higher-curvature operators. The\n$\\textit{field-theoretic}$ expansion is governed by the mass of the lightest\n(tower of) new degrees of freedom, as expected from standard field theory\nconsiderations. Conversely, the $\\textit{quantum-gravitational}$ expansion is\nsuppressed relative to the Einstein-Hilbert term by the quantum gravity cutoff,\n$\\Lambda_{\\rm QG}$, above which no local gravitational EFT description remains\nvalid. This structure becomes manifest in the so-called $\\textit{asymptotic\nregime}$, where a hierarchy between the Planck scale and $\\Lambda_{\\rm QG}$\nemerges, the latter identified herein as the species scale. Most notably, we\ndemonstrate the features of the double EFT expansion through an\namplitudes-based approach in (toroidal compactifications of) ten-dimensional\nType IIA string theory, and via a detailed analysis of the supersymmetric black\nhole entropy in 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravities derived from Type II\nCalabi-Yau compactifications. We provide further evidence for our proposal\nacross various string theory setups, including Calabi-Yau compactifications of\nM/F-theory and Type II string theory.

    "abstract": "Local-type primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), predicted by many non-minimal\nmodels of inflation, creates a scale-dependent contribution to the power\nspectrum of large-scale structure (LSS) tracers. Its amplitude is characterized\nby the product $b_\\phi f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$, where $b_\\phi$ is an\nastrophysical parameter dependent on the properties of the tracer. However,\n$b_\\phi$ exhibits significant secondary dependence on halo concentration and\nother astrophysical properties, which may bias and weaken the constraints on\n$f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporating\nknowledge of the relation between Lagrangian bias parameters and $b_\\phi$ can\nsignificantly enhance PNG constraints. We employ the Hybrid Effective Field\nTheory (HEFT) approach at the field-level and a linear regression model to seek\na connection between the bias parameters and $b_{\\phi}$ for halo and galaxy\nsamples, constructed using the \\textsc{AbacusSummit} simulation suite and\nmimicking the luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) of\nthe Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. For the fixed-mass halo\nsamples, our full bias model reduces the uncertainty by more than 70\\%, with\nmost of that improvement coming from $b_\\nabla$, which we find to be an\nexcellent proxy for concentration. For the galaxy samples, our model reduces\nthe uncertainty on $b_\\phi$ by 80\\% for all tracers. By adopting\nLagrangian-bias informed priors on the parameter $b_\\phi$, future analyses can\nthus constrain $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$ with less bias and smaller errors.",

We assume that the energy injected into nonthermal\nelectrons is proportional to the jet Poynting flux, and we account for\nsynchrotron cooling via a broken power-law energy distribution. We implement\nour emission model in both general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD)\nsimulations and axisymmetric force-free electrodynamic (GRFFE) jet models and\nproduce simulated jet images at multiple scales and frequencies using polarized\ngeneral relativistic radiative transfer. We find that the synchrotron emission\nis concentrated parallel to the local helical magnetic field and that this\nfeature produces limb-brightened jet images on scales ranging from tens of\nmicroarcseconds to hundreds of milliarcseconds in M87. We present theoretical\npredictions for horizon-scale M87 jet images at 230 and 345 GHz that can be\ntested with next generation instruments. Due to the scale-invariance of the\nGRMHD and GRFFE models, our emission prescription can be applied to other\ntargets and serve as a foundation for a unified description of limb-brightened\nsynchrotron images of extragalactic jets.",

Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that\nthese strategies can effectively enhance the robustness of existing\nout-of-context detectors amidst polluted evidence.",

    "abstract": "We propose Relightable Full-Body Gaussian Codec Avatars, a new approach for\nmodeling relightable full-body avatars with fine-grained details including face\nand hands. The unique challenge for relighting full-body avatars lies in the\nlarge deformations caused by body articulation and the resulting impact on\nappearance caused by light transport. Changes in body pose can dramatically\nchange the orientation of body surfaces with respect to lights, resulting in\nboth local appearance changes due to changes in local light transport\nfunctions, as well as non-local changes due to occlusion between body parts. To\naddress this, we decompose the light transport into local and non-local\neffects. Local appearance changes are modeled using learnable zonal harmonics\nfor diffuse radiance transfer. Unlike spherical harmonics, zonal harmonics are\nhighly efficient to rotate under articulation. This allows us to learn diffuse\nradiance transfer in a local coordinate frame, which disentangles the local\nradiance transfer from the articulation of the body. To account for non-local\nappearance changes, we introduce a shadow network that predicts shadows given\nprecomputed incoming irradiance on a base mesh. This facilitates the learning\nof non-local shadowing between the body parts. Finally, we use a deferred\nshading approach to model specular radiance transfer and better capture\nreflections and highlights such as eye glints. We demonstrate that our approach\nsuccessfully models both the local and non-local light transport required for\nrelightable full-body avatars, with a superior generalization ability under\nnovel illumination conditions and unseen poses.",

    "abstract": "In the field of computational logic, two classes of finite automata are\nconsidered fundamental: deterministic and nondeterministic automata (DFAs and\nNFAs). In a more fine-grained approach three natural intermediate classes were\nintroduced, defined by restricting the number of accepting runs of the input\nNFA. The classes are called: unambiguous, finitely ambiguous, and polynomially\nambiguous finite automata. It was observed that central problems, like\nequivalence, become tractable when the input NFA is restricted to some of these\nclasses. This naturally brought interest into problems determining whether an\ninput NFA belongs to the intermediate classes.\n  Our first result is a nearly complete characterization of the fine-grained\ncomplexity of these problems. We show that the respective quadratic and cubic\nrunning times of Allauzen et al. are optimal under the Orthogonal Vectors\nhypothesis or the k-Cycle hypothesis, for alphabets with at least two symbols.\nIn contrast, for unary alphabets we show that all aforementioned variants of\nambiguity can be decided in almost linear time.\n  Finally, we study determinisability of unambiguous weighted automata. We\npositively resolve a conjecture of Allauzen and Mohri, proving that their\nquadratic-time algorithm for verifying determinisability of unambiguous\nweighted automata is optimal, assuming the Orthogonal Vectors hypothesis or the\nk-Cycle hypothesis. We additionally show that for unary alphabets, this can be\ndecided in linear time.",

Here, we\nexplore this problem in the context of solving real-world GitHub issues from\nthe SWE-bench dataset. Our system, named CodeMonkeys, allows models to\niteratively edit a codebase by jointly generating and running a testing script\nalongside their draft edit. We sample many of these multi-turn trajectories for\nevery issue to generate a collection of candidate edits. This approach lets us\nscale \"serial\" test-time compute by increasing the number of iterations per\ntrajectory and \"parallel\" test-time compute by increasing the number of\ntrajectories per problem. With parallel scaling, we can amortize up-front costs\nacross multiple downstream samples, allowing us to identify relevant codebase\ncontext using the simple method of letting an LLM read every file. In order to\nselect between candidate edits, we combine voting using model-generated tests\nwith a final multi-turn trajectory dedicated to selection. Overall, CodeMonkeys\nresolves 57.4% of issues from SWE-bench Verified using a budget of\napproximately 2300 USD. Our selection method can also be used to combine\ncandidates from different sources.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel methodology of fine-tuning for large language\nmodels-dynamic LoRA. Building from the standard Low-Rank Adaptation framework,\nthis methodology further adds dynamic adaptation mechanisms to improve\nefficiency and performance. The key contribution of dynamic LoRA lies within\nits adaptive weight allocation mechanism coupled with an input feature-based\nadaptive strategy. These enhancements allow for a more precise fine-tuning\nprocess that is more tailored to specific tasks. Traditional LoRA methods use\nstatic adapter settings, not considering the different importance of model\nlayers. In contrast, dynamic LoRA introduces a mechanism that dynamically\nevaluates the layer's importance during fine-tuning. This evaluation enables\nthe reallocation of adapter parameters to fit the unique demands of each\nindividual task, which leads to better optimization results. Another gain in\nflexibility arises from the consideration of the input feature distribution,\nwhich helps the model generalize better when faced with complicated and diverse\ndatasets. The joint approach boosts not only the performance over each single\ntask but also the generalization ability of the model. The efficiency of the\ndynamic LoRA was validated in experiments on benchmark datasets, such as GLUE,\nwith surprising results. More specifically, this method achieved 88.1% accuracy\nwith an F1-score of 87.3%. Noticeably, these improvements were made at a slight\nincrease in computational costs: only 0.1% more resources than standard LoRA.\nThis balance between performance and efficiency positions dynamic LoRA as a\npractical, scalable solution for fine-tuning LLMs, especially in\nresource-constrained scenarios. To take it a step further, its adaptability\nmakes it a promising foundation for much more advanced applications, including\nmultimodal tasks.",

Our MCRT simulations\nwere performed for global PPD models, each composed of a local 3D\nhigh-resolution RHD model embedded in an axisymmetric global disk simulation.\nWe report the level of agreement between the two approaches and point out\nseveral caveats that prevent a perfect match between the temperature\ndistributions with our respective methods of choice. Overall, the level of\nagreement is high, with a typical discrepancy between the RHD and MCRT\ntemperatures of the high-resolution region of only about 10 percent. The\nlargest differences were found close to the disk photosphere, at the transition\nlayer between optically dense and thin regions, as well as in the far-out\nregions of the PPD, occasionally exceeding values of 40 percent. We identify\nseveral reasons for these discrepancies, which are mostly related to general\nfeatures of typical radiative transfer solvers used in hydrodynamical\nsimulations (angle- and frequency-averaging and ignored scattering) and MCRT\nmethods (ignored internal energy advection and compression and expansion work).\nThis provides a clear pathway to reduce systematic temperature inaccuracies in\nfuture works.

Recent work identifies the bias\nwithin the observed data as a possible root cause and shows that fairness and\npredictive performance are in fact in accord when predictive performance is\nmeasured on unbiased data. We offer a causal explanation for these findings\nusing the framework of the FiND (fictitious and normatively desired) world, a\n\"fair\" world, where protected attributes have no causal effects on the target\nvariable. We show theoretically that (i) classical fairness metrics deemed to\nbe incompatible are naturally satisfied in the FiND world, while (ii) fairness\naligns with high predictive performance. We extend our analysis by suggesting\nhow one can benefit from these theoretical insights in practice, using causal\npre-processing methods that approximate the FiND world. Additionally, we\npropose a method for evaluating the approximation of the FiND world via\npre-processing in practical use cases where we do not have access to the FiND\nworld.

We argue that DFL can be\nleveraged to learn the parameters of system dynamics, expressed as constraint\nof the convex optimization control policy, while the system control signal is\nbeing optimized, thus creating an end-to-end learning framework. This is\nparticularly relevant for systems in which behavior changes once the control\npolicy is applied, hence rendering historical data less applicable. The\nproposed approach can perform system identification - i.e., determine\nappropriate parameters for the system analytical model - and control\nsimultaneously to ensure that the model's accuracy is focused on areas most\nrelevant to control. Furthermore, because black-box systems are\nnon-differentiable, we design a loss function that requires solely to measure\nthe system response. We propose pre-training on historical data and constraint\nrelaxation to stabilize the DFL and deal with potential infeasibilities in\nlearning.

In\nthis paper, we establish new techniques for deriving quantitative estimates for\nthe order of approximation for multivariate linear operators of the\npointwise-type, with respect to the $L^p$-norm and to the so-called\ndissimilarity index defined through the continuous SSIM. In particular, we\nconsider a family of approximation operators known as neural network (NN)\noperators, that have been widely studied in the last years in view of their\nconnection with the theory of artificial neural networks. For these operators,\nwe first establish sharp estimates in case of $C^1$ and piecewise (everywhere\ndefined) $C^1$-functions. Then, the case of functions modeling digital images\nis considered, and specific quantitative estimates are achieved, including\nthose with respect to the mentioned dissimilarity index. Moreover, the above\nanalysis has also been extended to $L^p$-spaces, using a new constructive\ntechnique, in which the multivariate averaged modulus of smoothness has been\nemployed. Finally, numerical experiments of image resizing have been given to\nsupport the theoretical results. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm has\nbeen evaluated through similarity indexes such as SSIM, likelihood index\n(S-index) and PSNR, and compared with other rescaling methods, including\nbilinear, bicubic, and upscaling-de la Vall\\'ee-Poussin interpolation (u-VPI).\nNumerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method for image\nprocessing tasks, particularly in terms of the aforementioned SSIM, and are\nconsistent with the provided theoretical analysis.",

We build upon a recent development which\nsuggested the use of special noise-robust Virtual Hybrid Edge Detection (VHED)\nfunctions as network inputs, although that work used only highly simplified and\nmathematically ideal models. In this work we strengthen the case for the use of\nEIT, and VHED functions especially, for stroke classification. We design models\nwith high detail and mathematical realism to test the use of VHED functions as\ninputs. Virtual patients are created using a physically detailed 2D head model\nwhich includes features known to create challenges in real-world imaging\nscenarios. Conductivity values are drawn from statistically realistic\ndistributions, and phantoms are afflicted with either hemorrhagic or ischemic\nstrokes of various shapes and sizes. Simulated noisy EIT electrode data,\ngenerated using the realistic Complete Electrode Model (CEM) as opposed to the\nmathematically ideal continuum model, is processed to obtain VHED functions. We\ncompare the use of VHED functions as inputs against the alternative paradigm of\nusing raw EIT voltages. Our results show that (i) stroke classification can be\nperformed with high accuracy using 2D EIT data from physically detailed and\nmathematically realistic models, and (ii) in the presence of noise, VHED\nfunctions outperform raw data as network inputs.",

Subsequently, hot rolling\nexperiments were performed at varying linear speeds (26- and 130-mm s-1) and\ninterpass annealing times (2.5 and 10 minutes). Results demonstrated that\nhigher rolling speeds led to finer microstructure, while longer interpass\nannealing times resulted in reduced twin fraction and more inhomogeneous\nmicrostructure. The processed material was then subjected to cold drawing with\napproximately 12% true strain per pass. Different annealing conditions\n(275{\\deg}C and 375{\\deg}C for 2.5-10 minutes) between drawing passes were\nevaluated.

To address\nthis gap, we propose a fully unsupervised Natural Language Processing (NLP)\npipeline capable of extracting and evaluating referral reasons without relying\non labelled datasets.\n  Methods: Our pipeline leverages Transformer-based embeddings pre-trained on\nItalian medical texts to cluster referral reasons and assess their alignment\nwith appropriateness guidelines. It operates in an unsupervised setting and is\ndesigned to generalize across different examination types. We analyzed two\ncomplete regional datasets from the Lombardy Region (Italy), covering all\nreferrals between 2019 and 2021 for venous echocolordoppler of the lower limbs\n(ECD;n=496,971; development) and flexible endoscope colonoscopy (FEC;\nn=407,949; testing only).

Due\nto the mismatch between the (inapplicable) exact predictor state and the\npredictor state constructed in the presence of state quantization, a global\nstabilization result is possible under a global Lipschitzness assumption on the\nvector field, as well as under the assumption of existence of a globally\nLipschitz, nominal feedback law that achieves global exponential stability of\nthe delay and quantization-free system. To address the constraints imposed by\nquantization, a dynamic switching strategy is constructed, adjusting the\nquantizer's tunable parameter in a piecewise constant manner-initially\nincreasing the quantization range, to capture potentially large system states\nand subsequently refining the precision to reduce quantization error. The\nglobal asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is established through\nsolutions estimates derived using backstepping transformations, combined with\nsmall-gain and input-to-state stability arguments.

The reasons for their\nremarkable ability to generalize are not well understood yet. It has also been\nknown that deep networks possess the ability to memorize training data, as\nevidenced by perfect or high training accuracies on models trained with\ncorrupted data that have class labels shuffled to varying degrees.\nConcomitantly, such models are known to generalize poorly, i.e. they suffer\nfrom poor test accuracies, due to which it is thought that the act of\nmemorizing substantially degrades the ability to generalize. It has, however,\nbeen unclear why the poor generalization that accompanies such memorization,\ncomes about. One possibility is that in the process of training with corrupted\ndata, the layers of the network irretrievably reorganize their representations\nin a manner that makes generalization difficult. The other possibility is that\nthe network retains significant ability to generalize, but the trained network\nsomehow chooses to readout in a manner that is detrimental to generalization.\nHere, we provide evidence for the latter possibility by demonstrating,\nempirically, that such models possess information in their representations for\nsubstantially improved generalization, even in the face of memorization.\nFurthermore, such generalization abilities can be easily decoded from the\ninternals of the trained model, and we build a technique to do so from the\noutputs of specific layers of the network.

Second, we examine the effectiveness of two families of\nlarge language models (LLMs) -- BERT and GPT -- in automatically classifying\nlegal provisions based on requirements-related food-safety concepts.

    "abstract": "Over-the-air (OTA) computation has emerged as a promising technique for\nefficiently aggregating data from massive numbers of wireless devices. OTA\ncomputations can be performed by analog or digital communications. Analog OTA\nsystems are often constrained by limited function adaptability and their\nreliance on analog amplitude modulation. On the other hand, digital OTA systems\nmay face limitations such as high computational complexity and limited\nadaptability to varying network configurations. To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes a novel digital OTA computation system with a channel-aware\nconstellation design for demodulation mappers. The proposed system dynamically\nadjusts the constellation based on the channel conditions of participating\nnodes, enabling reliable computation of various functions. By incorporating\nchannel randomness into the constellation design, the system prevent overlap of\nconstellation points, reduces computational complexity, and mitigates excessive\ntransmit power consumption under poor channel conditions. Numerical results\ndemonstrate that the system achieves reliable NMSE performance across a range\nof scenarios, offering valuable insights into the choice of signal processing\nmethods and weighting strategies under varying computation point\nconfigurations, node counts, and quantization levels.

We utilize the correspondence between such singular\ncurves and embedded curves in its normal crossing resolution recently\nhighlighted by McDuff-Siegel, and also a criterion for the existence of\nembedded curves in the relative settings by McDuff-Opshtein. Another main\ntechnical input is Zhang's curve cone theorem for tamed almost complex\n$4$-manifolds, which is crucial in reducing the complexity of divisors.

In this work, we explore the\nelectronic structures and instabilities of strained thin films on substrates to\nidentify the key factors for achieving superconductivity, using\nfirst-principles and functional renormalization group (FRG) calculations. Our\nfindings suggest that the compressed NiO$_2$ bilayer at the interface is\nunlikely to exhibit superconductivity due to the elongation of outer apical\nNi-O bond length and electron-doping effect.

To\ntackle these limitations, we present a unified framework for SL optimization,\nadaptable to diverse lighting conditions, object types, and different types of\nSL. Our framework quickly determines the optimal projection pattern using only\na single projected image. Key contributions include a novel global matching\nmethod for projectors, enabling precise projector-camera alignment with just\none projected image, and a new projection compensation model with a photometric\nadjustment module to reduce artifacts from out-of-gamut clipping.

However, a standardized dataset to benchmark the agent capabilities of\nLLMs in medical applications is currently lacking, making the evaluation of\nLLMs on complex tasks in interactive healthcare environments challenging. To\naddress this gap, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad evaluation suite designed\nto assess the agent capabilities of large language models within medical\nrecords contexts. MedAgentBench encompasses 300 patient-specific\nclinically-derived tasks from 10 categories written by human physicians,\nrealistic profiles of 100 patients with over 700,000 data elements, a\nFHIR-compliant interactive environment, and an accompanying codebase.

The best model\n(Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2) achieves a success rate of 69.67%. However, there is\nstill substantial space for improvement which gives the community a next\ndirection to optimize.

We employ Gaussian process regression to achieve the inverse mapping\nand extract the characteristic parameters of polymers from the structure factor\nwith low relative error.",

    "abstract": "Generating talking avatar driven by audio remains a significant challenge.\nExisting methods typically require high computational costs and often lack\nsufficient facial detail and realism, making them unsuitable for applications\nthat demand high real-time performance and visual quality. Additionally, while\nsome methods can synchronize lip movement, they still face issues with\nconsistency between facial expressions and upper body movement, particularly\nduring silent periods. In this paper, we introduce SyncAnimation, the first\nNeRF-based method that achieves audio-driven, stable, and real-time generation\nof speaking avatar by combining generalized audio-to-pose matching and\naudio-to-expression synchronization. By integrating AudioPose Syncer and\nAudioEmotion Syncer, SyncAnimation achieves high-precision poses and expression\ngeneration, progressively producing audio-synchronized upper body, head, and\nlip shapes. Furthermore, the High-Synchronization Human Renderer ensures\nseamless integration of the head and upper body, and achieves audio-sync lip.\nThe project page can be found at https://syncanimation.github.io",

Although each agent retains its\ndataset locally, sharing local models can still expose private information\nabout the local training datasets to adversaries. To mitigate privacy attacks,\na common strategy is to inject random artificial noise at each agent before\nexchanging local models between neighbors.

The resulting accretion disks are subject to\nLense-Thirring precession, and hence torque. Analytical calculations and\nsimulations show that Lense-Thirring precession will warp, and, for large\nmisalignments, fracture the disk. In GRMHD simulations, the warping or breaking\noccurs at $\\lesssim10r_s$, where $r_s$ is the Schwarzschild radius. Considering\nthat accretion disk spectra in the soft state of stellar-mass black holes are\ngenerally well modeled as multicolor blackbodies, the question arises as to how\nconsistent warped and broken disks are with observations. Here, we analytically\ncalculate thermal spectra of warped and broken disks with a warp or break\nradius at $10r_s$ for various disk inclinations. Due to self-irradiation and\nthe projected area of the inclined disk regions, the spectra of inclined disks\nsignificantly deviate from multicolor blackbodies and do not follow the\nmulticolor blackbody relation $\\nu L_\\nu\\propto\\nu^{\\gamma}=\\nu^{4/3}$ at low\nfrequencies $\\nu$. The power-law indices at low frequencies of the inclined\ndisks vary with viewing angle; when viewed face-on, they vary between\n$\\gamma\\approx0.91-1.26$ for the warped disks and $\\gamma\\approx1.37-1.54$ for\nthe broken disks depending on the inclination angle. The differences decrease\nwhen moving the location of the disk warp and break to larger radii; for\ninclined disks to emit as multicolor blackbodies, they must warp or break at\nradii $\\geq50r_s$.

To\nmaintain the orthogonal among different OAM modes, perfect alignments between\ntransmitters and receivers are strictly required. However, in multi-user OAM\ncommunications, the perfect alignments between the transmitter and all the\nreceivers are impossible. The phase turbulence, caused by misaligned\ntransmitters and receivers, leads to serious inter-mode interference, which\ngreatly degrades the capacity of OAM transmissions. To eliminate the negative\neffects of phase turbulence and further enhance the transmission capacity, we\nintroduce RIS into the system, and propose a joint precoder and reflector\ndesign for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multi-user OAM\ncommunication systems. Specifically, we propose a three-layer design at the\ntransmitter side, which includes inter-user OAM mode interference cancellation,\ninter-mode self-interference elimination and the power allocation among\ndifferent users. By analyzing the characteristics of the overall channels, we\nare able to give the specific expressions of the precoder designs, which\nsignificantly reduce the optimization complexity. We further leverage RIS to\nguarantee the line-ofsight (LoS) transmissions between the transmitter and\nusers for better sum rate performance.

We train a policy to\npredict (1) action sequences and (2) abstract observation sequences. The first\nobjective uses action chunking to improve action prediction and reduce\ncompounding errors. The second objective extends this idea of chunking by\npredicting abstract observation sequences.

    "abstract": "The need to explore and/or optimize expensive simulators with many\nqualitative factors arises in broad scientific and engineering problems. Our\nmotivating application lies in path planning - the exploration of feasible\npaths for navigation, which plays an important role in robotics, surgical\nplanning and assembly planning. Here, the feasibility of a path is evaluated\nvia expensive virtual experiments, and its parameter space is typically\ndiscrete and high-dimensional. A carefully selected experimental design is thus\nessential for timely decision-making. We propose here a novel framework, called\nQuIP, for experimental design of Qualitative factors via Integer Programming\nunder a Gaussian process surrogate model with an exchangeable covariance\nfunction. For initial design, we show that its asymptotic D-optimal design can\nbe formulated as a variant of the well-known assignment problem in operations\nresearch, which can be efficiently solved to global optimality using\nstate-of-the-art integer programming solvers. For sequential design\n(specifically, for active learning or black-box optimization), we show that its\ndesign criterion can similarly be formulated as an assignment problem, thus\nenabling efficient and reliable optimization with existing solvers. We then\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of QuIP over existing methods in a suite of path\nplanning experiments and an application to rover trajectory optimization.",

This\ntechnique has broad applications in neuroscience, neuroengineering, and\nmedicine, enabling researchers to explore the relationship between neuron\nlocation and activity. Recent advancements in deep generative models (DGMs)\nhave facilitated the modeling of neuronal population dynamics, uncovering\nlatent representations that provide insights into behavior prediction and\nneuronal variance. However, these models often rely on spike inference\nalgorithms and primarily focus on population-level dynamics, limiting their\napplicability for single-neuron analyses. To address this gap, we propose a\nnovel framework for single-neuron representation learning using autoregressive\nvariational autoencoders (AVAEs). Our approach embeds individual neurons'\nspatiotemporal signals into a reduced-dimensional space without the need for\nspike inference algorithms. The AVAE excels over traditional linear methods by\ngenerating more informative and discriminative latent representations,\nimproving tasks such as visualization, clustering, and the understanding of\nneuronal activity. Additionally, the reconstruction performance of the AVAE\noutperforms the state of the art, demonstrating its ability to accurately\nrecover the original fluorescence signal from the learned representation. Using\nrealistic simulations, we show that our model captures underlying physical\nproperties and connectivity patterns, enabling it to distinguish between\ndifferent firing and connectivity types.

To address this, we\nquantify the impact of real-world acoustic scenes on speech separation and\nexplore how spatial cues can enhance separation quality efficiently. We analyze\nperformance based on implicit spatial cues (inherent in the acoustic input and\nlearned by the model) and explicit spatial cues (manually calculated spatial\nfeatures added as auxiliary inputs).

Explicit spatial cues are\nparticularly beneficial when implicit spatial cues are weak. For instance,\nsingle CI microphone recordings provide weaker implicit spatial cues than\nbilateral CIs, but even single CIs benefit from explicit cues. These results\nemphasize the importance of training models on real-world data to improve\ngeneralizability in everyday listening scenarios.

We establish\nthe existence of fair divisions and develop approximation algorithms to compute\nthem.\n  We address two complementary valuation classes, subadditive and nonnegative,\nwhich go beyond monotone functions. Considering both the division of cake\n(divisible resources) and allocation of indivisible items, we obtain fairness\nguarantees in terms of (approximate) envy-freeness (EF) and equability (EQ)\n  In the context of envy-freeness, we prove that an EF division of a cake\nalways exists under cake valuations that are subadditive and globally\nnonnegative. This result complements the nonexistence of EF allocations for\nburnt cakes known for more general valuations. In the indivisible-items\nsetting, we establish the existence of EF3 allocations for subadditive and\nglobally nonnegative valuations. In addition, we obtain universal existence of\nEF3 allocations under nonnegative valuations.\n  We study equitability under nonnegative valuations. Here, we prove that EQ3\nallocations always exist when the agents' valuations are nonnegative. Also, in\nthe indivisible-items setting, we develop an approximation algorithm that, for\ngiven nonnegative valuations, finds allocations that are equitable within\nadditive margins.\n  Our results have combinatorial implications.

Unexpectedly, the\nformer value is nearly triple of the Hvcal = 2.66 GPa predicted by density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations and the latter value is about one or two\norders of magnitude smaller than that of ordinary titanium alloy materials\n(KICexp = 30-120 MPa m0.5).These specifications place Ti2Co far from the phase\nspace of the known alloy materials, but close to medium hardness materials such\nas MgO or TiO2. Upon incorporation of oxygen into structural void positions,\nboth values were simultaneously improved for Ti4Co2O to = 9.7 GPa and 2.19 MPa\nm0.5, respectively. Further DFT calculations on the electron localization\nfunction of Ti4Co2X (X = B, C, N, O) vs. the interstitial elements indicate\nthat these simultaneous improvements originate from the coexistence of Ti-Co\nmetallic bonds, the emergence of newly oriented Ti-X covalent bonds, and the\nincrease of electron concentration. Moreover, the large difference between\nHvexp and Hvcal of Ti2Co suggests underlying mechanism concerning the absence\nof the O(16d) or Ti2-O bonds in the O-(Ti2)6 octahedron.Our discovery expands\nthe phase space of alloy materials and illuminates the path of exploring\nsuperconducting materials with excellent mechanical performances.",

Training neural operators typically requires a large amount of\ntraining data to ensure accuracy and generalization. In this paper, we propose\na novel data augmentation method specifically designed for training neural\noperators on evolution equations. Our approach utilizes insights from inverse\nprocesses of these equations to efficiently generate data from random\ninitialization that are combined with original data. To further enhance the\naccuracy of the augmented data, we introduce high-order inverse evolution\nschemes. These schemes consist of only a few explicit computation steps, yet\nthe resulting data pairs can be proven to satisfy the corresponding implicit\nnumerical schemes. In contrast to traditional PDE solvers that require small\ntime steps or implicit schemes to guarantee accuracy, our data augmentation\nmethod employs explicit schemes with relatively large time steps, thereby\nsignificantly reducing computational costs. Accuracy and efficacy experiments\nconfirm the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we validate our\napproach through experiments with the Fourier Neural Operator and UNet on three\ncommon evolution equations that are Burgers' equation, the Allen-Cahn equation\nand the Navier-Stokes equation. The results demonstrate a significant\nimprovement in the performance and robustness of the Fourier Neural Operator\nwhen coupled with our inverse evolution data augmentation method.",

This structural diversity\ncomplicates the analysis of homophily, as traditional homophily metrics fail to\naccount for distinct label spaces across node types.

In the first\npart of this dissertation, we demonstrate that it is possible to design\nlanguages for forward error analysis with NumFuzz, a functional programming\nlanguage whose type system expresses quantitative bounds on rounding error.\nThis type system combines a sensitivity analysis, enforced through a linear\ntyping discipline, with a novel graded monad to track the accumulation of\nrounding errors. We establish the soundness of the type system by relating the\ndenotational semantics of the language to both an exact and floating-point\noperational semantics. To demonstrate the practical utility of NumFuzz as a\ntool for automated error analysis, we have developed a prototype implementation\ncapable of automatically inferring error bounds. Our implementation produces\nbounds competitive with existing tools, while often achieving significantly\nfaster analysis times. In the second part of this dissertation, we explore a\ntype-based approach to backward error analysis with Bean, a first-order\nprogramming language with a linear type system that can express quantitative\nbounds on backward error. Bean's type system combines a graded coeffect system\nwith strict linearity to soundly track the flow of backward error through\nprograms. To illustrate Bean's potential as a practical tool for automated\nbackward error analysis, we implement a variety of standard algorithms from\nnumerical linear algebra in Bean, establishing fine-grained backward error\nbounds via typing in a compositional style. We also develop a prototype\nimplementation of Bean that infers backward error bounds automatically.

    "abstract": "We revisit the elementary problem of moving a particle in a harmonic trap in\nfinite time with minimal work cost, and extend it to the case of an active\nparticle. By comparing the Gaussian case of an Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nparticle and the non-Gaussian run-and-tumble particle, we establish general\nprinciples for thermodynamically optimal control of active matter beyond\nspecific models. We show that the open-loop optimal protocols, which do not\nincorporate system-state information, are identical to those of passive\nparticles but result in larger work fluctuations due to activity. In contrast,\nclosed-loop (or feedback) control with a single (initial) measurement changes\nthe optimal protocol and reduces the average work relative to the open-loop\ncontrol for small enough measurement errors. Minimum work is achieved by\nparticles with finite persistence time. As an application, we propose an active\ninformation engine which extracts work from self-propulsion. This periodic\nengine achieves higher information efficiency with run-and-tumble particles\nthan with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles. Complementing a companion paper\nthat gives only the main results [arXiv:2407.18542], here we provide a full\naccount of our theoretical calculations and simulation results.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel FSL loss based on \\emph{geometric mean} to embed\ndiscriminative metric into deep features. In contrast to the other losses such\nas utilizing arithmetic mean in softmax-based formulation, the proposed method\nleverages geometric mean to aggregate pair-wise relationships among samples for\nenhancing discriminative metric across class categories.

Federated learning\n(FL) provides an effective approach to collaborative training models while\npreserving privacy. However, as model parameters and training data grow, there\nare not only real differences in data resources between different data owners,\nbut also mismatches between data and computing resources. These challenges lead\nto inadequate collaboration among data owners, compute centers, and model\nowners, reducing the global utility of the three parties and the effectiveness\nof data assetization. In this work, we first propose a framework for\nresource-decoupled FL involving three parties.

Next, we propose the\nQuality-aware Dynamic Resources-decoupled FL algorithm (QD-RDFL), in which we\nderive and solve the optimal strategies of all parties to achieve SNE using\nbackward induction. We also design a dynamic optimization mechanism to improve\nthe optimal strategy profile by evaluating the contribution of data quality\nfrom data owners to the global model during real training.

Yet at its core is the use of\nself-attention, whose memory and computational cost grow quadratically with the\nsequence length $N$, rendering it prohibitively expensive for long sequences. A\npromising approach is top-$k$ attention, which selects only the $k$ most\nrelevant tokens and achieves performance comparable to vanilla self-attention\nwhile significantly reducing space and computational demands. However, causal\nmasks require the current query token to only attend to past tokens, preventing\nthe existing top-$k$ attention method from efficiently searching for the most\nrelevant tokens in parallel, thereby limiting training efficiency. In this\nwork, we propose ZETA, leveraging \\textbf{Z}-Order Curves for\n\\textbf{E}fficient \\textbf{T}op-$k$ \\textbf{A}ttention, to enable parallel\nquerying of past tokens for entire sequences. % in both space and time\ncomplexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$. We first theoretically show that the\nchoice of key and query dimensions involves a trade-off between the curse of\ndimensionality and the preservation of relative distances after projection. In\nlight of this insight, we propose reducing the dimensionality of keys and\nqueries in contrast to values and further leverage $Z$-order curves to map\nlow-dimensional keys and queries into \\emph{one}-dimensional space, which\npermits parallel sorting, thereby largely improving the efficiency for top-$k$\ntoken selection.

This configuration, termed the $N$-in-1 AWE\nsystem, packs $N$ stacks into a modular system, reducing land requirements, the\ncomplexity of plant topology, and overall capital costs. However, the coupling\nof these stacks through the shared BoP introduces challenges in dynamic\noperation under varying energy inputs, making their performance unclear\ncompared to traditional 1-in-1 systems. To address this, we develop a\nstate-space model of the $N$-in-1 AWE system, capturing the dynamic behaviors\nof lye circulation, temperature, and HTO impurity, and their impact on energy\nconversion efficiency. We then propose a nonlinear model predictive controller\n(NMPC) to coordinately optimize inter-stack electrolytic current distribution,\nlye flow, and cooling, enabling the system to dynamically track varying load\ncommands while maximizing efficiency, stabilizing temperature, and limiting HTO\nimpurity accumulation. Simulation studies on a 4,000 Nm$^3$/h-rated 4-in-1\nsystem verify the proposed controller under dynamic operation. Comparison with\n4 independent 1-in-1 systems reveals that, with proper control, the $N$-in-1\nconfiguration offers comparable flexibility in accommodating real-world wind\npower inputs. The average differences in the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs)\nfor load-tracking and stack temperature stabilization, and specific energy\nconsumption are below 0.014 MW, 2.356 K, and 0.003 kWh/Nm$^3$.",

The two out of three velocity components show morphological\ncorrespondence with the infrared cold dust emission and connect with the bridge\nfeature on a position-velocity diagram.

In this work, we present the first optimal hybrid\nquantum-classical MAPF algorithms which are based on branch-andcut-and-price.\nQC is integrated by iteratively solving QUBO problems, based on conflict\ngraphs. Experiments on actual quantum hardware and results on benchmark data\nsuggest that our approach dominates previous QUBO formulationsand\nstate-of-the-art MAPF solvers.",

    "abstract": "Modern software-defined networks, such as Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN)\nsystems, rely on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered applications running on\ncontrollers interfaced with the radio access network. To ensure that these AI\napplications operate reliably at runtime, they must be properly calibrated\nbefore deployment. A promising and theoretically grounded approach to\ncalibration is conformal prediction (CP), which enhances any AI model by\ntransforming it into a provably reliable set predictor that provides error bars\nfor estimates and decisions. CP requires calibration data that matches the\ndistribution of the environment encountered during runtime. However, in\npractical scenarios, network controllers often have access only to data\ncollected under different contexts -- such as varying traffic patterns and\nnetwork conditions -- leading to a mismatch between the calibration and runtime\ndistributions. This paper introduces a novel methodology to address this\ncalibration-test distribution shift. The approach leverages meta-learning to\ndevelop a zero-shot estimator of distribution shifts, relying solely on\ncontextual information. The proposed method, called meta-learned\ncontext-dependent weighted conformal prediction (ML-WCP), enables effective\ncalibration of AI applications without requiring data from the current context.\nAdditionally, it can incorporate data from multiple contexts to further enhance\ncalibration reliability.",

    "abstract": "Chiral superconductors are topological as characterized by a finite Chern\nnumber and chiral edge modes. Direct fingerprints of chiral superconductivity\nare thus often taken to be spontaneous edge currents with associated magnetic\nsignatures. However, a number of recent theoretical studies have shown that the\ntotal edge current along semi-infinite edges is greatly reduced or even\nvanishes in many scenarios for all pairing symmetries except chiral $p$-wave,\nthus impeding experimental detection. We demonstrate how mesoscopic\nfinite-sized samples can be designed to give rise to a shape- and\nsize-dependent strong enhancement of the chiral edge currents and their\ngenerated orbital magnetic moment and magnetic fields. In particular, we find\nthat low rotational symmetry systems, such as pentagons and hexagons, give rise\nto the largest currents, while circular disks also generate large currents but\nin the opposite direction. We estimate the resulting magnetic fields to be as\nlarge as $0.01-0.5$ mT, with a magnetic moment approaching $\\mu_B/2$ per Cooper\npair (Bohr magneton $\\mu_B$). The current and magnetic signatures diverge with\nshrinking system sizes, eventually cut off by finite-size suppression of chiral\nsuperconductivity. We extract the full phase diagram as a function of\ntemperature and system size for different geometries, including competing\nsuperconducting orders. In geometries strongly suppressing only one of the\n$d$-wave components, we find an additional heat capacity jump, as large as\n$10\\%$ of the bulk normal-superconducting transition, marking the transition\nbetween a chiral and a nodal $d$-wave state. This further acts as an indirect\nsignature of chiral superconductivity. Our results are relevant for system\nsizes on the order of tens to hundreds of coherence lengths, and highlight\nmesoscopic patterning as a viable route to experimentally identify chiral\n$d$-wave superconductivity.",

We exploit the possibility to create local\npotential perturbation by the scanning gate tip which allows controllable\nmodification of the spatial distribution of the Majorana modes, which is\ntranslated into changes in their energy structure. When the tip scans across\nthe system, it effectively divides the wire into two parts with controllable\nlengths, in which two pairs of Majorana states are created when the system is\nin the topological regime. For strong values of the tip potential the pairs are\ndecoupled, and the presence of Majorana states can be detected via local\ntunneling spectroscopy that resolves the energy splittings resulting from the\nMajorana states wave functions overlap. Importantly, as the system is probed\nspatially via the tip, this technique can distinguish Majorana bound states\nfrom quasi-Majorana states localized on smooth potential barriers. We\ndemonstrate that for weaker tip potentials the two neighboring Majorana states\nhybridize opening pronounced anticrossings in the energy spectra which are\nreflected in local conductance maps and which result in non-zero non-local\nconductance features. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of the disorder on the\nscanning gate microscopy spectroscopy maps.",

FU Orionis-type objects form a\nYSO subclass, distinguished by rapid, multi-magnitude increases in brightness\nat optical and near-infrared wavelengths. These outbursts may significantly\nimpact the chemistry and molecular composition around eruptive stars. However,\nno comprehensive millimeter-wavelength line survey exists for more evolved\n(Class II) sources, unlike optical and near-infrared coverage. We conducted the\nfirst wideband millimeter spectral line survey of V1057 Cyg, a low-mass\neruptive FUor with the highest observed peak accretion rate in its class. Using\nthe IRAM 30-m telescope, we surveyed the 72-263 GHz range and complemented this\nwith targeted spectra at 219, 227, 291, and 344 GHz with the APEX 12-m\ntelescope. We conducted radiative transfer and population diagram analyses to\nget first estimates of the excitation temperatures and column densities.\nSeveral molecular species trace large-scale structures, and the\nposition-velocity diagram of $^{12}$CO suggest episodic outburst activity, with\noutflow dynamical timescales on the order of tens of thousands of years. We\nidentified simple molecules (C-, N-, O-, and S-bearing), deuterated species,\nmolecular ions, and complex organic molecules. With over 30 molecular species\n(including isotopologues) detected, V1057 Cyg demonstrates rich chemistry for\nits evolutionary state, compared to other younger (Class 0/I) FUors. V1057 Cyg\nis a good candidate for future interferometric studies to resolve emission\nstructures, to possibly constrain molecular freeze-out, and detect water and\ncomplex organic molecules. Our results highlight the importance of millimeter\nline surveys in complementing optical/near-infrared studies, improving\nstatistics on molecular inventories in eruptive stars and their environments.",

When it comes to algorithmic fairness, heterogeneous ensembles,\ncomposed of multiple model types, have been employed to mitigate biases in\nterms of demographic attributes such as sex, age or ethnicity. Moreover, recent\nwork has shown how in multi-class problems even simple homogeneous ensembles\nmay favor performance of the worst-performing target classes. While homogeneous\nensembles are simpler to implement in practice, it is not yet clear whether\ntheir benefits translate to groups defined not in terms of their target class,\nbut in terms of demographic or protected attributes, hence improving fairness.\nIn this work we show how this simple and straightforward method is indeed able\nto mitigate disparities, particularly benefiting under-performing subgroups.\nInterestingly, this can be achieved without sacrificing overall performance,\nwhich is a common trade-off observed in bias mitigation strategies. Moreover,\nwe analyzed the interplay between two factors which may result in biases:\nsub-group under-representation and the inherent difficulty of the task for each\ngroup. These results revealed that, contrary to popular assumptions, having\nbalanced datasets may be suboptimal if the task difficulty varies between\nsubgroups.

However, a versatile AI model requires large-scale data and\ncomprehensive annotations, which are often impractical in medical settings.\nRecent studies leverage radiology reports as a naturally high-quality\nsupervision for medical images, using contrastive language-image pre-training\n(CLIP) to develop language-informed models for radiological image\ninterpretation. Nonetheless, these approaches typically contrast entire images\nwith reports, neglecting the local associations between imaging regions and\nreport sentences, which may undermine model performance and interoperability.\nIn this paper, we propose a fine-grained vision-language model (fVLM) for\nanatomy-level CT image interpretation. Specifically, we explicitly match\nanatomical regions of CT images with corresponding descriptions in radiology\nreports and perform contrastive pre-training for each anatomy individually.\nFine-grained alignment, however, faces considerable false-negative challenges,\nmainly from the abundance of anatomy-level healthy samples and similarly\ndiseased abnormalities. To tackle this issue, we propose identifying false\nnegatives of both normal and abnormal samples and calibrating contrastive\nlearning from patient-level to disease-aware pairing. We curated the largest CT\ndataset to date, comprising imaging and report data from 69,086 patients, and\nconducted a comprehensive evaluation of 54 major and important disease\ndiagnosis tasks across 15 main anatomies. Experimental results demonstrate the\nsubstantial potential of fVLM in versatile medical image interpretation.

    "abstract": "A central feature of biological intelligence is the ability to learn to\nlearn, enabling rapid adaptation to novel tasks and environments. Yet its\nneural basis remains elusive, particularly regarding intrinsic properties, as\nconventional models rely on simplified point-neuron approximations that neglect\ntheir dynamics. Inspired by astrocyte-mediated neuromodulation, we propose a\nhierarchically modulated recurrent spiking neural network (HM-RSNN) that models\nlearning-to-learn with regulation of intrinsic neuronal properties at two\nspatiotemporal scales. Global modulation captures task-dependent gating of\nplasticity driven by wide-field calcium waves, whereas local adaptation\nsimulates microdomain calcium-mediated fine-tuning of intrinsic properties\nwithin task-relevant subspaces. We evaluate HM-RSNN on four cognitive tasks,\ndemonstrating its computational advantages over standard RSNNs and artificial\nneural networks, and revealing task-dependent adaptations across multiple\nscales, including intrinsic properties, neuronal specialization, membrane\npotential dynamics, and network modularity. Converging evidence and biological\nconsistency position HM-RSNN as a biologically grounded framework, providing\ntestable insights into how astrocyte-mediated hierarchical modulation of\nintrinsic properties shapes multi-scale neural dynamics that support\nlearning-to-learn.",

We employ\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to study the plasma instabilities of\nrelativistic pair beams propagating in a denser background plasma, using the\nparameters designed to replicate astrophysical jets under laboratory\nconditions. In an astrophysical scenario with a broad, dilute beam,\nelectromagnetic instability is suppressed because the beam exhibits momentum\nanisotropy with a large longitudinal momentum spread compared to its transverse\nmomentum. We find the range of density contrast at which electrostatic modes\nare dominating over electromagnetic modes with an anisotropic beam in\nlaboratory scales, consistent with the physically relevant conditions for\nBlazar-induced beams. We have used a broad Cauchy distribution for the beam\nparticles, which is more realistic in representing the non-Maxwellian nature of\npair beams, improving upon previous studies.

Although each\nnotation offers distinct advantages in representational clarity and cognitive\neffectiveness, they are seldom integrated, leading to compatibility challenges.\nIn this paper, we set aside the imperative-declarative dichotomy to focus on\norchestrating services that execute the underlying tasks. We propose an\nexecution semantics based on the Continuous Query Language (CQL), where CQL\nstatements respond dynamically to streams of events. As events unfold, these\nCQL statements update the execution state (tables) and can generate new events,\neffectively triggering (web) services that implement specific process tasks.

Each ballot cast by a voter is a\n(potentially partial) ranking over a set of candidates. The margin of victory,\nor simply 'margin', is the smallest number of ballots that need to be\nmanipulated to alter the set of winners. Knowledge of the margin of an election\ngives greater insight into both how much time and money should be spent on\nauditing the election, and whether uncovered mistakes throw the election result\ninto doubt -- requiring a costly repeat election -- or can be safely ignored\nwithout compromising the integrity of the result. Lower bounds on the margin\ncan also be used for this purpose, in cases where exact margins are difficult\nto compute. There is one existing approach to computing lower bounds on the\nmargin of STV elections, while there are multiple approaches to finding upper\nbounds. In this paper, we present improvements to this existing lower bound\ncomputation method for STV margins.

    "abstract": "Any applied mathematical model contains parameters. The paper proposes to use\nkernel learning for the parametric analysis of the model. The approach consists\nin setting a distribution on the parameter space, obtaining a finite training\nsample from this distribution, solving the problem for each parameter value\nfrom this sample, and constructing a kernel approximation of the parametric\ndependence on the entire set of parameter values. The kernel approximation is\nobtained by minimizing the approximation error on the training sample and\nadjusting kernel parameters (width) on the same or another independent sample\nof parameters. This approach to learning complex dependencies is called kernel\nlearning (or kernel SVM). Traditionally, kernel learning is considered in the\nso-called Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) with a fixed kernel. The\nnovelty of our approach is that we consider the kernel learning in a broad\nsubspace of square-integrable functions with a corresponding L_2-norm\nregularization. This subspace contains linear combinations of kernel functions\nwith kernels of different shapes at different data points. The approach\nessentially uses a derived analytical representation of the L2-norm for kernel\nfunctions. Thus the approach substantially extends the flexibility of the\ntraditional kernel SVM for account of the number of adjusted parameters and\nminimization of the training error not only over weights of kernels but also\nover their shapes. The important issue of selecting the optimal regularization\nparameter is resolved by minimizing the test error over this parameter.\nNumerical illustrations are provided.",

Methods: We propose a decomposition of\nFisher's information matrix to examine and calculate the sample size required\nfor developing a model that aims for precise and fair risk estimates. We\npropose a six-step process which can be used before data collection or when an\nexisting dataset is available. Steps (1) to (5) require researchers to specify\nthe overall risk in the target population at a key time-point of interest; an\nassumed pragmatic 'core model' in the form of an exponential regression model;\nthe (anticipated) joint distribution of core predictors included in that model;\nand the distribution of any censoring. Results: We derive closed-form solutions\nthat decompose the variance of an individual's estimated event rate into\nFisher's unit information matrix, predictor values and total sample size; this\nallows researchers to calculate and examine uncertainty distributions around\nindividual risk estimates and misclassification probabilities for specified\nsample sizes. We provide an illustrative example in breast cancer and emphasise\nthe importance of clinical context, including risk thresholds for decision\nmaking, and examine fairness concerns for pre- and post-menopausal women.\nLastly, in two empirical evaluations, we provide reassurance that uncertainty\ninterval widths based on our approach are close to using more flexible models.\nConclusions: Our approach allows users to identify the (target) sample size\nrequired to develop a prediction model for time-to-event outcomes, via the\npmstabilityss module.

To this end, we mounted the warm optics,\nconsisting of a modified Dragonian dual reflector system, on a motor controlled\nhexapod. Crucial in the alignment procedure is our sky chopper, which allows\nfast beam switching. It has a small entrance and exit aperture coupling to\n(cold) sky, which creates a measurable signal with respect to the warm cabin\nenvironment. By scanning the instrument beam across the entrance aperture of\nthe sky chopper using the hexapod, we found the hexapod configuration that\nproduced the lowest signal on our detectors, implying the beam is coupled fully\nto cold sky and not the warm cabin. We first characterized the alignment\nprocedure in the laboratory, where we used a vat containing liquid nitrogen as\nthe cold source behind the sky chopper. Then, we applied the alignment\nprocedure to DESHIMA 2.0 at ASTE.

In this work, we focus on settings\nwhere the agent's type is drawn from an unknown distribution, and formalize an\noffline learning framework for learning near-optimal contracts from sample\nagent types. A central tool in our analysis is the notion of pseudo-dimension\nfrom statistical learning theory. Beyond its role in establishing upper bounds\non the sample complexity, pseudo-dimension measures the intrinsic complexity of\na class of contracts, offering a new perspective on the tradeoffs between\nsimplicity and optimality in contract design. Our main results provide\nessentially optimal tradeoffs between pseudo-dimension and representation error\n(defined as the loss in principal's utility) with respect to linear and bounded\ncontracts. Using these tradeoffs, we derive sample- and time-efficient learning\nalgorithms, and demonstrate their near-optimality by providing almost matching\nlower bounds on the sample complexity. Conversely, for unbounded contracts, we\nprove an impossibility result showing that no learning algorithm exists.\n  Finally, we extend our techniques in three important ways. First, we provide\nrefined pseudo-dimension and sample complexity guarantees for the combinatorial\nactions model, revealing a novel connection between the number of critical\nvalues and sample complexity. Second, we extend our results to menus of\ncontracts, showing that their pseudo-dimension scales linearly with the menu\nsize. Third, we adapt our algorithms to the online learning setting, where we\nshow that, a polynomial number of type samples suffice to learn near-optimal\nbounded contracts.

First, the method based on a model of star\nformation in Hi-GAL-defined dense clumps, adjusted for an increase in the\ngas-to-dust ratio with Galactocentric radius, predicts $1.65\\pm0.61$ M$_\\odot$\nyr$^{-1}$. Second, the method using the 70 $\\mu$m emission, commonly used in\nother galaxies, with a technique to assign distances to the extended emission,\npredicts $1.42^{+0.63}_{-0.44}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Finally, a method based on\ntheoretical predictions of star formation efficiency as a function of virial\nparameter, with masses corrected for metallicity dependence, applied to a\ncatalog of molecular clouds also predicts a value in agreement at $1.47$\nM$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The three methods predict the radial variation of the star\nformation rate, with remarkably good agreement from the CMZ out to about 20\nkpc. More differences were seen in face-on maps with a resolution of 0.5 kpc\nmade with the three approaches and in comparisons to the local (within 3 kpc)\nstar formation rate, indicating limitations of the methods when applied to\nsmaller scales. The 70 $\\mu$m star formation rate follows very closely the\nsurface density of molecular gas, corrected for a metallicity-dependent CO\nconversion factor.

The MINCE (Measuring at Intermediate Metallicity Neutron-Capture\nElements) project aims to provide high quality neutron-capture abundances\nmeasurements in several hundred stars at intermediate metallicity,-2.5 < [Fe/H]\n< -1.5. This project will shed light on the origin of the neutron-capture\nelements and the chemical enrichment of the Milky Way. Aims. The goal of this\nwork is to chemically characterize the second sample of the MINCE project and\ncompare the abundances with the galactic chemical evolution model at our\ndisposal. Methods. We performed a standard abundance analysis based on 1D LTE\nmodel atmospheres on high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise-ratio UVES\nspectra. Results. We provide the kinematic classification (i.e., thin disk,\nthick disk, thin-to-thick disk, halo, Gaia Sausage Enceladus, Sequoia) of 99\nstars and the atmospheric parameters for almost all stars. We derive the\nabundances for light elements (from Na to Zn) and neutron-capture elements (Rb,\nSr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu) in a subsample of 32 stars in the\nmetallicity range -2.5 < Fe/H] < -1.00. In the subsample of 32 stars, we\nidentify 8 active stars exhibiting (inverse) P-Cygni profile and one Li-rich\nstar, CD 28-11039. We find a general agreement between the chemical abundances\nand the stochastic model computed for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way\nhalo for the elements Mg, Ca, Si, Ti, Sc, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba,\nLa, and Eu . Conclusions. The MINCE project has already significantly increased\nthe number of neutron-capture elements measurements in the intermediate\nmetallicity range. The results from this sample are in perfect agreement with\nthe previous MINCE sample. The good agreement between the chemical abundances\nand the chemical evolution model of the Galaxy supports the nucleosynthetic\nprocesses adopted to describe the origin of the n-capture elements.",

Traditional methods for boundary value\ntest input generation can be time-consuming and may struggle to address all\npotential error cases effectively, especially in systems with intricate or\nhighly variable boundaries. This paper presents a framework for assessing the\neffectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in generating boundary value test\ninputs for white-box software testing by examining their potential through\nprompt engineering. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-based\ntest input generation by analyzing fault detection rates and test coverage,\ncomparing these LLM-generated test sets with those produced using traditional\nboundary value analysis methods. Our analysis shows the strengths and\nlimitations of LLMs in boundary value generation, particularly in detecting\ncommon boundary-related issues. However, they still face challenges in certain\nareas, especially when handling complex or less common test inputs. This\nresearch provides insights into the role of LLMs in boundary value testing,\nunderscoring both their potential and areas for improvement in automated\ntesting methods.",

We\nfirst study the case that the giant atom is coupled to the waveguide via two\ncoupling points, and obtain Bethe ansatz eigenstates and eigenvalues in the\nHilbert space of two-excitation. Then we derive bound states by subtracting the\nstates corresponding to Bethe ansatz solutions from the entire two-excitation\nHilbert space, and construct the two-photon scattering matrix (S-matrix) by\nusing Bethe ansatz eigenstates and bound states. We further study the\nproperties of output states, which include both the scattering and bound\nstates, for arbitrarily incident two-photon states by using a concrete example.\nWe find that the oscillation period of the scattering states and decay rates of\nthe bound states strongly depend on the distance between two coupling points.\nMoreover, we find that the two-photon correlation in the bound states can be\nenhanced by changing such distance when the total energy of two incident\nphotons equals to two times of single photon resonance energy. We also\ngeneralize our study to the case that the giant atom is coupled to the\nwaveguide via $N$ coupling points. We obtain all the eigenstates and\neigenvalues of the scattering matrix and construct the S-matrix. Comparing with\nthe case of the two coupling points, we find the photon correlation can be\nfurther enhanced by increasing the number of the coupling points for the same\nincident states when the distance of any two nearest neighbor coupling points\nis half of the wavelength.",

Our goal is to look for wide common\nproper motion companions to metal-poor stars and study the binarity frequency\nat low metallicity with astrometry from large-scale catalogues (Gaia, VHS, and\nWISE). We used the stellar parameter determination from the latest release of\nGaia to identify metal-poor stars over the entire sky.

We also considered other\npublic catalogues of metal-poor stars to look for co-moving companions. We\nobtained our own high-resolution images of a subsample with the lucky imaging\ntechnique. We found a few bona fide co-moving systems among a sample of 610\nmetal-poor stars with metallicities below -1.5 dex in the full sky. We inferred\na multiplicity rate below 3%, with 3sigma completeness for projected\nseparations larger than 8 au, after taking into account incompleteness and any\nother limiting factors of our search. At closer separations, we found a minimum\nbinary fraction of 20% that appears to be relatively independent of\nmetallicity. We conclude that the multiplicity fraction of solar-type stars is\nrelatively independent of metallicity for close-in companions with projected\nseparations below ~8 au. Between 8 and 10000 au, the binary fraction of\nmetal-poor stars drops significantly to a few percent and is significantly\nlower than the multiplicity derived for the solar-metallicity case.

Multi-agent reinforcement learning\n(MARL) has a strong ability in cooperative tasks. On the other hand, it faces\nits own challenges, particularly with convergence. This paper introduces\nMARL-OT, a scalable framework that leverages MARL to detect safety violations\nof ADS resulting from surrounding vehicles' cooperation. MARL-OT employs MARL\nfor high-level guidance, triggering various dangerous scenarios for the\nrule-based online fuzzer to explore potential safety violations of ADS, thereby\ngenerating dynamic, realistic safety violation scenarios. Our approach improves\nthe detected safety violation rate by up to 136.2% compared to the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) testing technique.",

By relaxing the constraint of\nHermiticity while preserving $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry of the nonlocal\ninteractions, it is herein built a framework where the dispersion transitions\nfrom positive to negative group velocity, passing through an intermediate\nregime characterized by a perfectly flat band across all momenta.

Fortunately, devices like robots can\nbe trained with synthetic experience thanks to virtual environments. With this\napproach, the sample efficiency problems of artificial agents are mitigated,\nbut another issue arises: the need for efficiently transferring the synthetic\nexperience into the real world (sim-to-real).\n  This paper analyzes the robustness of a state-of-the-art sim-to-real\ntechnique known as progressive neural networks (PNNs) and studies how adding\ndiversity to the synthetic experience can complement it.

Thus far, no model can reason about\nexecutable implementations of databases or local transaction libraries\nproviding weak isolation levels. Weak isolation levels are characterized by\nbeing highly concurrent and, unlike their stronger counterpart serializability,\nthey are not equivalent to the consistency guarantees provided by a transaction\nlibrary implemented using a global lock. Industrial-strength databases almost\nexclusively implement weak isolation levels as their default level. This calls\nfor formalism as numerous bugs violating isolation have been detected in these\ndatabases. In this paper, we formalize three weak isolation levels in\nseparation logic, namely read uncommitted, read committed, and snapshot\nisolation. We define modular separation logic specifications that are\nindependent of the underlying transaction library implementation. Historically,\nisolation levels have been specified using examples of executions between\nconcurrent transactions that are not allowed to occur, and we demonstrate that\nour specifications correctly prohibit such examples. To show that our\nspecifications are realizable, we formally verify that an executable\nimplementation of a key-value database running the multi-version concurrency\ncontrol algorithm from the original snapshot isolation paper satisfies our\nspecification of snapshot isolation. Moreover, we prove implications between\nthe specifications -- snapshot isolation implies read committed and read\ncommitted implies read uncommitted -- and thus the verification effort of the\ndatabase serves as proof that all of our specifications are realizable.

We find that structures with atoms in\nsymmetric chemical bonding environments exhibit greater resilience to\nstructural perturbations induced by QNEs, while those with atoms in asymmetric\nbonding environments are more susceptible to structural alterations, resulting\nin enhanced superconducting critical temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Payment channel networks (PCNs) offer a promising solution to address the\nlimited transaction throughput of deployed blockchains. However, several\nattacks have recently been proposed that stress the vulnerability of PCNs to\ntimelock and censoring attacks. To address such attacks, we introduce\nThunderdome, the first timelock-free PCN. Instead, Thunderdome leverages the\ndesign rationale of virtual channels to extend a timelock-free payment channel\nprimitive, thereby enabling multi-hop transactions without timelocks. Previous\nworks either utilize timelocks or do not accommodate transactions between\nparties that do not share a channel.\n  At its core, Thunderdome relies on a committee of non-trusted watchtowers,\nknown as wardens, who ensure that no honest party loses funds, even when\noffline, during the channel closure process. We introduce tailored incentive\nmechanisms to ensure that all participants follow the protocol's correct\nexecution. Besides a traditional security proof that assumes an honest majority\nof the committee, we conduct a formal game-theoretic analysis to demonstrate\nthe security of Thunderdome when all participants, including wardens, act\nrationally. We implement a proof of concept of Thunderdome on Ethereum to\nvalidate its feasibility and evaluate its costs. Our evaluation shows that\ndeploying Thunderdome, including opening the underlying payment channel, costs\napproximately \\$15 (0.0089 ETH), while the worst-case cost for closing a\nchannel is about \\$7 (0.004 ETH).",

Transforming the Euclid\nimaging for large samples of galaxies into maps of physical parameters in an\nefficient and reliable manner is an outstanding challenge. We investigate the\npower and reliability of machine learning techniques to extract the\ndistribution of physical parameters within well-resolved galaxies. We focus on\nestimating stellar mass surface density, mass-averaged stellar metallicity and\nage. We generate noise-free, synthetic high-resolution imaging data in the\nEuclid photometric bands for a set of 1154 galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological\nsimulation. The images are generated with the SKIRT radiative transfer code,\ntaking into account the complex 3D distribution of stellar populations and\ninterstellar dust attenuation. We use a machine learning framework to map the\nidealised mock observational data to the physical parameters on a\npixel-by-pixel basis. We find that stellar mass surface density can be\naccurately recovered with a $\\leq 0.130 {\\rm \\,dex}$ scatter. Conversely,\nstellar metallicity and age estimates are, as expected, less robust, but still\ncontain significant information which originates from underlying correlations\nat a sub-kpc scale between stellar mass surface density and stellar population\nproperties.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated their superiority and\nversatility in modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), effectively adapting\nto various downstream tasks through further fine-tuning. Federated\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) has emerged as a promising solution\nto address privacy and efficiency challenges in distributed training for PLMs\non resource-constrained local devices. However, our measurements reveal two key\nlimitations of FedPEFT: heterogeneous data across devices exacerbates\nperformance degradation of low-rank adaptation, and a fixed parameter\nconfiguration results in communication inefficiency. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose FedARA, a novel Adaptive Rank Allocation framework for\nfederated parameter-efficient fine-tuning of language models. Specifically,\nFedARA employs truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) adaptation to\nenhance similar feature representation across clients, significantly mitigating\nthe adverse effects of data heterogeneity. Subsequently, it utilizes dynamic\nrank allocation to progressively identify critical ranks, effectively improving\ncommunication efficiency. Lastly, it leverages rank-based module pruning to\nautomatically remove inactive modules, steadily reducing local computational\ncost and memory usage in each federated learning round. Extensive experiments\nshow that FedARA consistently outperforms baselines by an average of 6.95% to\n8.49% across various datasets and models under heterogeneous data while\nsignificantly improving communication efficiency by 2.40$ \\times$. Moreover,\nexperiments on various edge devices demonstrate substantial decreases in total\ntraining time and energy consumption by up to 48.90% and 46.95%, respectively.",

To address this, we\npropose the Kolmogorov Arnold Neural Interpolator (KANI), a novel framework\nthat redefines meteorological field representation as continuous neural\nfunctions derived from discretized grids. Grounded in the Kolmogorov Arnold\ntheorem, KANI captures the inherent continuity of atmospheric states and\nleverages sparse in-situ observations to correct these biases systematically.\nFurthermore, KANI introduces an innovative zero-shot downscaling capability,\nguided by high-resolution topographic textures without requiring\nhigh-resolution meteorological fields for supervision. Experimental results\nacross three sub-regions of the continental United States indicate that KANI\nachieves an accuracy improvement of 40.28% for temperature and 67.41% for wind\nspeed, highlighting its significant improvement over traditional interpolation\nmethods.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying\nthese huge caloric effects remain inadequately understood, and general\nprinciples for enhancing the performance of caloric plastic crystals are\nlacking. Previous studies have predominantly focused on molecular rotations,\noverlooking other potentially critical factors, such as lattice vibrations and\nmolecular conformations. In this study, we employ classical molecular dynamics\n(MD) simulations to both replicate and elucidate the microscopic origins of the\nexperimentally observed colossal barocaloric (BC) effects -- those driven by\nhydrostatic pressure -- in the archetypal plastic crystal neopentyl glycol\n(NPG). Our MD simulations demonstrate that in NPG, the combined BC response and\nphase-transition entropy changes arising from lattice vibrations and molecular\nconformations are nearly equal to those from molecular reorientations,\ncontributing 45% and 55%, respectively. These findings suggest that, alongside\nhydrogen bonding -- which directly impacts molecular rotational dynamics --\nlattice vibrational and molecular structural features, often overlooked, must\nbe integrated into the rational design and modeling of advanced caloric plastic\ncrystals.

    "abstract": "Context: Microservice-based systems have established themselves in the\nsoftware industry. However, sustainability-related legislation and the growing\ncosts of energy-hungry software increase the importance of energy efficiency\nfor these systems. While some proposals for architectural tactics and patterns\nexist, their effectiveness as well as potential trade-offs on other quality\nattributes (QAs) remain unclear.\n  Goal: We therefore aim to study the effectiveness of microservices tactics\nand patterns to reduce energy consumption, as well as potential trade-offs with\nperformance and maintainability.\n  Method: Using the open-source Online Boutique system, we conducted a\ncontrolled experiment with three tactics and three patterns, and analyzed the\nimpact of each technique compared to a baseline. We also tested with three\nlevels of simulated request loads (low, medium, high).\n  Results: Request load moderated the effectiveness of reducing energy\nconsumption. All techniques (tactics and patterns) reduced the energy\nconsumption for at least one load level, up to 5.6%. For performance, the\ntechniques could negatively impact response time by increasing it by up to\n25.9%, while some also decreased it by up to 72.5%. Two techniques increased\nthe throughput, by 1.9% and 34.0%. For maintainability, three techniques had a\nnegative, one a positive, and two no impact.\n  Conclusion: Some techniques reduced energy consumption while also improving\nperformance. However, these techniques usually involved a trade-off in\nmaintainability, e.g., via more code duplication and module coupling. Overall,\nall techniques significantly reduced energy consumption at higher loads, but\nmost of them sacrificed one of the other QAs. This highlights that the real\nchallenge is not simply reducing energy consumption of microservices, but to\nachieve energy efficiency.",

For long-horizon tasks like hanging a\ntowel on a rack where previous methods fail completely, SKIL achieves a mean\nsuccess rate of 70\\% with as few as 30 demonstrations. Furthermore, SKIL\nnaturally supports cross-embodiment learning due to its semantic keypoints\nabstraction. Our experiments demonstrate that even human videos bring\nconsiderable improvement to the learning performance.

To characterize the fine\nstructure of this seismic gap and its seismic-aseismic interplay, we\ninstrumented the region with almost 200 seismic and geodetic stations.

We infer a detailed slab geometry, showing that the flat slab\nis dipping towards the south with a narrower extent along dip. The slab\ngeometry controls the intraslab seismicity, with cross-cutting activity in the\nregion of highest bending and a downdip limit around 105 km slab depth.

However, most of the existing works on resource\nallocation and service placement in MEC systems overlook the unique\ncharacteristics of new IoT use cases. For instance, many IoT applications\nrequire the periodic execution of computing tasks on real-time data streams\nthat originate from devices dispersed over a wide area. Thus, users requesting\nIoT services are typically distant from the data producers. To fill this gap,\nthe contribution of this work is two-fold. Firstly, we propose a MEC-compliant\narchitectural solution to support the operation of multiple IoT service\nproviders over a common MEC platform deployment, which enables the steering and\nshaping of IoT data transport within the platform. Secondly, we model the\nproblem of service placement and data management in the proposed MEC-based\nsolution taking into account the dependencies at the data level between IoT\nservices and sensing resources. Our model also considers that caches can be\ndeployed on MEC hosts, to allow the sharing of the same data between different\nIoT services with overlapping geographical scope, and provides support for IoT\nservices with heterogeneous QoS requirements, such as different frequencies of\nperiodic task execution. Due to the complexity of the optimisation problem, a\nheuristic algorithm is proposed using linear relaxation and rounding\ntechniques. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the\nproposed approach, especially when traffic demands generated by the service\nrequests are not uniform.",

In this study, we illustrate the\ndiversity of electronic and optical characteristics as well as the nonlinear\nmixing effects on electronic structures within mixed VODPs. For mixed systems\nwith limited local environment options, the information regarding atomic-site\noccupation in-principle determines both structural configurations and all\nessential properties. Building upon this concept, we have developed a model\nthat integrates a data-augmentation scheme with a transformer-inspired graph\nneural network (GNN), which encodes atomic-site information from mixed systems.\nThis approach enables us to accurately predict band gaps and formation energies\nfor test samples, achieving Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) of 21 meV and 3.9\nmeV/atom, respectively. Trained with datasets that include (up to) ternary\nmixed systems and supercells with less than 72 atoms, our model can be\ngeneralized to medium- and high-entropy mixed VODPs (with 4 to 6 principal\nmixing elements) and large supercells containing more than 200 atoms.\nFurthermore, our model successfully reproduces experimentally observed bandgap\nbowing in Sn-based mixed VODPs and reveals an unconventional mixing effect that\ncan result in smaller band gaps compared to those found in pristine systems.",

Computational TIL\nassessment (CTA) has the potential to assist pathologists in this\nlabour-intensive task, but current CTA models rely heavily on many detailed\nannotations. We propose and validate a fundamentally simpler deep learning\nbased CTA that can be trained in only ten minutes on hundredfold fewer\npathologist annotations. We collected whole slide images (WSIs) with TILs\nscores and clinical data of 2,340 patients with BC from six cohorts including\nthree randomised clinical trials. Morphological features were extracted from\nwhole slide images (WSIs) using a pathology foundation model. Our\nlabel-efficient Computational stromal TIL assessment model (ECTIL) directly\nregresses the TILs score from these features. ECTIL trained on only a few\nhundred samples (ECTIL-TCGA) showed concordance with the pathologist over five\nheterogeneous external cohorts (r=0.54-0.74, AUROC=0.80-0.94). Training on all\nslides of five cohorts (ECTIL-combined) improved results on a held-out test set\n(r=0.69, AUROC=0.85). Multivariable Cox regression analyses indicated that\nevery 10% increase of ECTIL scores was associated with improved overall\nsurvival independent of clinicopathological variables (HR 0.86, p<0.01),\nsimilar to the pathologist score (HR 0.87, p<0.001). We demonstrate that ECTIL\nis highly concordant with an expert pathologist and obtains a similar hazard\nratio. ECTIL has a fundamentally simpler design than existing methods and can\nbe trained on orders of magnitude fewer annotations. Such a CTA may be used to\npre-screen patients for, e.g., immunotherapy clinical trial inclusion, or as a\ntool to assist clinicians in the diagnostic work-up of patients with BC.

In this work, we\nanalyze the long-range magnetic phase diagram incorporating such octahedral\nrotations and demonstrate the possibility of an altermagnetic phase in\nSr$_2$RuO$_4$. Using ab-initio calculations, we first study single layer\nSr$_2$RuO$_4$ with octahedral rotations, obtaining an orbital-selective\n$g$-wave altermagnetic phase. We further provide an effective $t_{2g}$\ntight-binding model, demonstrating that the $g$-wave altermagnetism is\nprimarily a product of second and third nearest neighbor interorbital\nhybridizations between the ${\\gamma}z$ ($\\gamma=x,y$) orbitals, but only a much\nlonger range intraorbital hybridization in the $xy$ orbitals, establishing a\nstrong orbital-selectiveness for the altermagnetism. Notably, by replacing the\n$xy$ orbital with the $x^2-y^2$ orbital, a similar tight-biding model may be\nused to investigate the hole-doped cuprate superconductors. We then study bulk\nSr$_2$RuO$_4$, where we find the altermagnetic phase as the magnetic ground\nstate for a range of finite octahedral rotations. In the bulk, interlayer\nhopping breaks some of the symmetries of the $g$-wave altermagnet, resulting in\na $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnet, still with orbital selectiveness. We also include\nrelativistic effects through spin-orbit coupling and obtain that an effective\nstaggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction generates weak ferromagnetism.\nFinally, we discuss the implications of the altermagnetic order on the\nintrinsic superconductivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Assuming in-plane and\nintraorbital pairing, the altermagnetism favors spin-singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave\nor $g$-wave pairing, or (nematic or chiral) combinations thereof.",

Expert human\npilots are able to agilely fly a drone through a race track by mapping the\nreal-time feed from a single onboard camera directly to control commands.\nRecent works in autonomous drone racing attempting direct pixel-to-commands\ncontrol policies (without explicit state estimation) have relied on either\nintermediate representations that simplify the observation space or performed\nextensive bootstrapping using Imitation Learning (IL). This paper introduces an\napproach that learns policies from scratch, allowing a quadrotor to\nautonomously navigate a race track by directly mapping raw onboard camera\npixels to control commands, just as human pilots do. By leveraging model-based\nreinforcement learning~(RL) - specifically DreamerV3 - we train visuomotor\npolicies capable of agile flight through a race track using only raw pixel\nobservations. While model-free RL methods such as PPO struggle to learn under\nthese conditions, DreamerV3 efficiently acquires complex visuomotor behaviors.\nMoreover, because our policies learn directly from pixel inputs, the\nperception-aware reward term employed in previous RL approaches to guide the\ntraining process is no longer needed. Our experiments demonstrate in both\nsimulation and real-world flight how the proposed approach can be deployed on\nagile quadrotors. This approach advances the frontier of vision-based\nautonomous flight and shows that model-based RL is a promising direction for\nreal-world robotics.",

In order to improve future tipping\nrisk assessments, understanding interactions between tipping elements is\ncrucial. The AMOC is known to influence the Intertropical Convergence Zone,\npotentially altering precipitation patterns over the AR and affecting its\nstability.

Specifically, we report a 4.8% increase of mean dry season\nprecipitation in the Southern AR for every 1 Sv of AMOC weakening. This finding\nis consistent across multiple data sources and AMOC strength indices. We show\nthat this stabilising interaction has offset 17% of dry season precipitation\ndecrease in the Southern AR since 1982.

By applying adaptive editing strengths, we dynamically\nadjust the steering vectors in the style subspace to maintain both stylistic\nfidelity and semantic integrity.

When the cluster's\ncore count increases, a flat all-to-all interconnect between cores and L1\nmemory banks becomes a physical implementation bottleneck, and hierarchical\nnetwork topologies are required. However, hierarchical, multi-level\nintra-cluster networks are subject to internal contention which may lead to\nsignificant performance degradation, especially for SIMD or vector cores, as\ntheir memory access is bursty.

In this paper, we innovatively propose\nthe Low-rank Prompt Interaction (LPI) to address this general problem of\nmulti-modal understanding, which considers both cross-modal and cross-task\ninteractions. Specifically, as for the former, we employ multi-modal\ncorrelation modules for corresponding Transformer layers. Considering that the\ntraining parameters scale to the number of layers and tasks, we propose\nlow-rank interaction-augmented decomposition to avoid memory explosion while\nenhancing the cross-modal association through sharing and separating\ncommon-specific low-rank factors. In addition, due to the multi-modal semantic\ndifferences carried by the low-rank initialization, we adopt hierarchical\nlow-rank contrastive learning to ensure training robustness. As for the latter,\nwe initially employ a visual analysis and identify that different tasks have\nclear distinctions in proximity. Therefore, we introduce explicit task\ncontrastive constraints in the prompt learning process based on task semantic\ndistances. Experiments on two retrieval tasks show performance improvements\nwith the introduction of a minimal number of parameters, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of our method.

However, frequent sensing and data\ntransmission can lead to significant resource consumption. To mitigate this\nissue, edge caching has been proposed as a solution for storing recently\ncollected data. Nonetheless, this approach may compromise data freshness. In\nthis paper, we investigate the trade-off between re-using cached task results\nand re-sensing tasks in cache-enabled MCS networks, aiming to minimize system\nlatency while maintaining information freshness. To this end, we formulate a\nweighted delay and age of information (AoI) minimization problem, jointly\noptimizing sensing decisions, user selection, channel selection, task\nallocation, and caching strategies. The problem is a mixed-integer non-convex\nprogramming problem which is intractable. Therefore, we decompose the long-term\nproblem into sequential one-shot sub-problems and design a framework that\noptimizes system latency, task sensing decision, and caching strategy\nsubproblems. When one task is re-sensing, the one-shot problem simplifies to\nthe system latency minimization problem, which can be solved optimally. The\ntask sensing decision is then made by comparing the system latency and AoI.\nAdditionally, a Bayesian update strategy is developed to manage the cached task\nresults. Building upon this framework, we propose a lightweight and\ntime-efficient algorithm that makes real-time decisions for the long-term\noptimization problem.

    "abstract": "In this letter we argue that the CPL parameterisation for the dark energy\nequation of state is biased towards preferring such model over the constant $w$\nwhile the latter bounds are still compatible with LCDM. For that we compare\nconstraints on the EoS parameters $w_0$ and early time type $w_a$ (CPL) against\nthose with a late time parameterisation on $w_a$ (LZ) and the constant $w$\nmodel, using CMB, Supernovae and BAO from DESI datasets. We found, the same as\nwas the case with CPL model, preference for dynamical dark energy within the LZ\nmodel, but for values almost symmetrically distributed with respect to their\nLCDM limits. This is due to the fact that the presence of $w_0$ allows to\nrecast each parametrisation into making it compensate the preference for $w\\sim\n-1$ in the opposite direction. To further test our hypothesis, we fixed $w_0$\nto -1 and followed a minimal approach by considering models that deviates by\none free parameter, or we extend to more general models that either group both\nlate and early effects, or allow the presence of two dark energy fluid alike\nand constant alike component. We found that all the variants, except the\noriginal CPL are still compatible with LCDM, with likelihoods peaking close to\n$w_0 = -1$, $w_a = 0$, or 0.68 for $\\Omega_{\\rm CC}$, with the constant $w$ and\nthe late time $w_a$ having the smallest constraints. Although we found that the\nevidence from CPL is stronger than those for the more minimal cases, however\nthe preference increases further for the more generalized parameterizations,\nwhile still staying compatible with LCDM in terms of the significance levels.\nWe conclude that considering CPL model is not sufficient to test deviation from\nthe standard model and that it is necessary to conduct further minimal or more\ngeneral approaches to better understand the outcomes from model testing and\ninference methods.(abridged)",

In this study, we focus on measuring the lower bound of entropy\nproduction at short time scales for generalized stochastic systems by\ncalculating the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the probability\ndensity functions of forward and backward trajectories. By analysing the\nentropy production across sliding time scales, we uncover patterns that reveal\ndistinctions between local, small-scale dynamics and the global, macroscopic\nbehavior, offering deeper insights into the system's departure from\nequilibrium. We also analysed the effects of switching to different types of\nnoise or fluctuations and found that the observations at larger time scales\nprovide no distinction between the different forms of noise while at short time\nscales, the distinction is significant.",

Previous studies focus on spatio-temporal modeling\nthrough the enhancement of architecture design and optimization strategies.\nHowever, they overlook the causal relationships in the joints, leading to\nmodels that may be overly tailored and thus estimate poorly to challenging\nscenes. Therefore, adequate causal reasoning capability, coupled with good\ninterpretability of model, are both indispensable and prerequisite for\nachieving reliable results. In this paper, we pioneer a causal perspective on\npose estimation and introduce a causal-inspired multitask learning framework,\nconsisting of two stages. \\textit{In the first stage}, we try to endow the\nmodel with causal spatio-temporal modeling ability by introducing two\nself-supervision auxiliary tasks. Specifically, these auxiliary tasks enable\nthe network to infer challenging keypoints based on observed keypoint\ninformation, thereby imbuing causal reasoning capabilities into the model and\nmaking it robust to challenging scenes. \\textit{In the second stage}, we argue\nthat not all feature tokens contribute equally to pose estimation. Prioritizing\ncausal (keypoint-relevant) tokens is crucial to achieve reliable results, which\ncould improve the interpretability of the model. To this end, we propose a\nToken Causal Importance Selection module to identify the causal tokens and\nnon-causal tokens (\\textit{e.g.}, background and objects).

    "abstract": "NCORES was a large observing program on the ESO HARPS spectrograph, dedicated\nto measuring the masses of Neptune-like and smaller transiting planets\ndiscovered by the TESS satellite using the radial velocity technique. This\npaper presents an overview of the programme, its scientific goals and published\nresults, covering 35 planets in 18 planetary systems. We present spectrally\nderived stellar characterisation and mass constraints for five additional TOIs\nwhere radial velocity observations found only marginally significant signals\n(TOI-510.01, $M_p=1.08^{+0.58}_{-0.55}M_\\oplus$), or found no signal (TOIs\n271.01, 641.01, 697.01 and 745.01). A newly detected non-transiting radial\nvelocity candidate is presented orbiting TOI-510 on a 10.0d orbit, with a\nminimum mass of $4.82^{+1.29}_{-1.26}M_\\oplus$, although uncertainties on the\nsystem architecture and true orbital period remain. Combining the NCORES sample\nwith archival known planets we investigate the distribution of planet masses\nand compositions around and below the radius gap, finding that the population\nof planets below the gap is consistent with a rocky composition and ranges up\nto a sharp cut-off at $10M_\\oplus$. We compare the observed distribution to\nmodels of pebble- and planetesimal-driven formation and evolution, finding good\nbroad agreement with both models while highlighting interesting areas of\npotential discrepancy. Increased numbers of precisely measured planet masses in\nthis parameter space are required to distinguish between pebble and\nplanetesimal accretion.",

The learner sequentially makes\npredictions of the agent's true linear objective function, and their quality is\nmeasured by the regret, the cumulative gap between optimal objective values and\nthose achieved by following the learner's predictions. A seminal work by\nB\\\"armann et al. (2017) obtained a regret bound of $O(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is\nthe time horizon. Subsequently, the regret bound has been improved to $O(n^4\n\\ln T)$ by Besbes et al.

In this paper, we\npresent the first logarithmic-regret method whose per-round complexity is\nindependent of $T$; indeed, it achieves the best-known bound of $O(n \\ln T)$.\nOur method is strikingly simple: it applies the online Newton step (ONS) to\nappropriate exp-concave loss functions. Moreover, for the case where the\nagent's actions are possibly suboptimal, we establish a regret bound of $O(n\\ln\nT + \\sqrt{\\Delta_T n\\ln T})$, where $\\Delta_T$ is the cumulative suboptimality\nof the agent's actions. This bound is achieved by using MetaGrad, which runs\nONS with $\\Theta(\\ln T)$ different learning rates in parallel. We also present\na lower bound of $\\Omega(n)$, showing that the $O(n\\ln T)$ bound is tight up to\nan $O(\\ln T)$ factor.",

To this end, we show how the accummulation of DNA inside\nthe nanochannel leads to crowding effects, and in some cases reversible\nblocking of DNA entry, and provide a detailed analysis based on a range of\ndifferent DNA samples and experimental conditions. Moreover, using\nbiotin-functionalised DNA and streptavidin-modified gold nanoparticles as\ntarget, we demonstrate in a proof-of-concept study how the crowding effect, and\nthe resulting increased residence time in nanochannel, can be exploited in a\nnew analytical paradigm, involving DNA injection into the nanochannel,\nincubation with the nanoparticle target and analysis of the complex by reverse\ntranslocation.

    "abstract": "Detecting biases in the outputs produced by generative models is essential to\nreduce the potential risks associated with their application in critical\nsettings. However, the majority of existing methodologies for identifying\nbiases in generated text consider the models in isolation and neglect their\ncontextual applications. Specifically, the biases that may arise in multi-agent\nsystems involving generative models remain under-researched. To address this\ngap, we present a framework designed to quantify biases within multi-agent\nsystems of conversational Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach involves\nsimulating small echo chambers, where pairs of LLMs, initialized with aligned\nperspectives on a polarizing topic, engage in discussions. Contrary to\nexpectations, we observe significant shifts in the stance expressed in the\ngenerated messages, particularly within echo chambers where all agents\ninitially express conservative viewpoints, in line with the well-documented\npolitical bias of many LLMs toward liberal positions. Crucially, the bias\nobserved in the echo-chamber experiment remains undetected by current\nstate-of-the-art bias detection methods that rely on questionnaires. This\nhighlights a critical need for the development of a more sophisticated toolkit\nfor bias detection and mitigation for AI multi-agent systems.

    "abstract": "Photosynthesis is vital for the survival of entire ecosystems on Earth. While\nlight is fundamental to this process, excessive exposure can be detrimental to\nplant cells. Chloroplasts, the photosynthetic organelles, actively move in\nresponse to light and self-organize within the cell to tune light absorption.\nThese disk-shaped motile organelles must balance dense packing for enhanced\nlight absorption under dim conditions with spatial rearrangements to avoid\ndamage from excessive light exposure. Here, we reveal that the packing\ncharacteristics of chloroplasts within plant cells show signatures of\noptimality. Combining measurements of chloroplast densities and\nthree-dimensional cell shape in the water plant Elodea densa, we construct an\nargument for optimal cell shape versus chloroplast size to achieve two targets:\ndense packing into a two-dimensional monolayer for optimal absorption under dim\nlight conditions and packing at the sidewalls for optimal light avoidance. We\nformalize these constraints using a model for random close packing matched with\npacking simulations of polydisperse hard disks confined within rectangular\nboxes. The optimal cell shape resulting from these models corresponds closely\nto that measured in the box-like plant cells, highlighting the importance of\nparticle packing in the light adaptation of plants. Understanding the interplay\nbetween structure and function sheds light on how plants achieve efficient\nphoto adaptation. It also highlights a broader principle: how cell shape\nrelates to the optimization of packing finite and relatively small numbers of\norganelles under confinement. This universal challenge in biological systems\nshares fundamental features with the mechanics of confined granular media and\nthe jamming transitions in dense active and passive systems across various\nscales and contexts.",

Here we report the discovery of two eclipsing white dwarf\nplus brown dwarf binaries containing very low mass brown dwarfs. ZTF J1828+2308\nconsists of a hot ($15900\\pm75$ K) $0.610\\pm0.004$ M$_{\\odot}$ white dwarf in a\n2.7 hour binary with a $0.0186\\pm0.0008$ M$_{\\odot}$ ($19.5\\pm0.8$\nM$_\\mathrm{Jup}$) brown dwarf.

While\nthe brown dwarf in ZTF J1828+2308 has a radius consistent with its mass and\nage, ZTF J1230$-$2655 contains a roughly 20 per cent overinflated brown dwarf\nfor its age. We are only able to reconstruct the common envelope phase for\neither system if it occurred after the first thermal pulse, when the white\ndwarf progenitor had already lost a significant fraction of its original mass.\nThis is true even for very high common envelope ejection efficiencies\n($\\alpha_\\mathrm{CE}\\sim 1$), unless both systems have extremely low\nmetallicities.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel stochastic method for modeling the transport of\nDelayed Neutron Precursors (DNPs) in liquid nuclear fuel. The method\nincorporates advection and diffusion effects into the Monte Carlo solution of\nthe neutron balance equation by leveraging the Green's function of the\nadvection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation. For a 1D system, we demonstrate\nthat the Green's function can be interpreted as the Probability Density\nFunction (PDF) of the position increment of a Brownian motion with drift. Using\nthis interpretation, the position of DNPs is sampled via a time-of-flight\nprocess combined with a drift and diffusion model. The method is validated on a\nmodified 1D rod problem, where results from the Monte Carlo implementation are\ncompared against those obtained using a deterministic approach. The comparison\nconfirms that the method accurately captures the impact of fuel velocity and\ndiffusion on neutron flux. As expected, the fuel velocity shifts the neutron\nflux. Reactivity decreases as a function of speed while diffusion can\ncounteract this decrease under certain conditions. While the current study is\nlimited to 1D systems, the approach could be extended to higher dimensions and\nmore complex geometries by replacing the Green's function with the Stochastic\nDifferential Equation (SDE) associated with the ADR equation.",

In this paper, we investigate CR transport in a time-dependent landscape\nof shocks in the Galactic halo. These shocks could result from local outbursts,\ne.g. starforming regions and superbubbles. CRs re-accelerated at such shocks\ncan reach energies above the knee. Since the shocks are closer to the Galaxy\nthan a termination shock and CRs escape downstream, they can propagate back\nmore easily. With such outbursts happening frequently, shocks will interact.\nThis interaction could adjust the CR spectrum, particularly for the particles\nthat are able to be accelerated at two shocks simultaneously. The transport and\nacceleration of CRs at the shock is modeled by Stochastic Differential\nEquations (SDEs) within the public CR propagation framework CRPropa. We\ndeveloped extensions for time-dependent wind profiles and for the first time\nconnected the code to hydrodynamic simulations, which were run with the public\nAthena++ code. We find that, depending on the concrete realization of the\ndiffusion tensor, a significant fraction of CRs can make it back to the Galaxy.\nThese could contribute to the observed spectrum around and above the CR knee\n($E \\gtrsim 10\\,\\mathrm{PeV}$). In contrast to simplified models, a simple\npower-law does not describe the energy spectra well. Instead, for single\nshocks, we find a flat spectrum ($E^{-2}$) at low energies, which steepens\ngradually until it reaches an exponential decline. When shocks collide, the\nenergy spectra transiently become harder than $E^{-2}$ at high energies.",

The primary\nmotivation for using password managers is the convenience of auto-filling.\nHowever, some participants avoid using password managers due to a lack of trust\nin these tools. Notably, dedicated third-party applications show low adoption\nfor both password manager and 2FA.\n  Despite acknowledging the importance of secure password practices, many\nparticipants still reuse passwords across multiple accounts, prefer shorter\npasswords, and use commonly predictable password patterns.

Next, we prove the existence of invariant measures when the\nproblem is autonomous by means of the fact that $H^\\gamma(\\mathcal{O})$ is\ncompactly embedded in $L^2(\\mathcal{O})$ with $\\gamma\\in (0,1)$. Moreover, the\nuniqueness of this invariant measure is presented which ensures the ergodicity\nof the problem. Finally, a large deviation principle result for solutions of\nSPDEs perturbed by small L\\'evy noise and Brownian motion is obtained by a\nvariational formula for positive functionals of a Poisson random measure and\nBrownian motion. Additionally, the results are illustrated by the fractional\nstochastic Chafee-Infante equations",

    "abstract": "To address the issue of powerful row hammer (RH) attacks, our study involved\nan extensive analysis of the prevalent attack patterns in the field. We\ndiscovered a strong correlation between the timing and density of the\nactive-to-active command period, ${tRC}$, and the likelihood of RH attacks. In\nthis paper, we introduce MARC, an innovative ARFM-driven RH mitigation IP that\nsignificantly reinforces existing RH mitigation IPs. MARC dynamically adjusts\nthe frequency of RFM in response to the severity of the RH attack environment,\noffering a tailored security solution that not only detects the threats but\nalso adapts to varying threat levels. MARC's detection mechanism has\ndemonstrated remarkable efficiency, identifying over 99\\% of attack patterns.\nMoreover, MARC is designed as a compact hardware module, facilitating tight\nintegration either on the memory controller-side or DRAM-side within the memory\nsystem. It only occupies a negligible hardware area of 3363~\\textit{$\\mu m^2$}.\nBy activating ARFM based on MARC's detection, the additional energy overhead is\nalso negligible in normal workloads. We conduct experiments to compare the\nhighest row count throughout the patterns, defined as max exposure, between the\nvanilla RH mitigation IPs and the MARC-enhanced versions of the same IPs,\nfocusing on both DRAM-side and memory controller-side. On the DRAM-side, MARC +\nprobabilistic scheme and MARC + counter-based tracking scheme achieve\n8.1$\\times$ and 1.5$\\times$ improvement in max exposure ratio compared to the\nvanilla IPs, respectively. On the memory controller-side, the MARC + PARA and\nMARC + Graphene achieve 50$\\times$ and 5.7$\\times$ improvement in max exposure\nratio compared to the vanilla IPs, respectively. MARC ensures optimal security\nwithout sacrificing system performance, making MARC a pioneering solution in\nthe realm of RH attack mitigation.",

Given that relaxed memory models, such as Total Store\nOrder (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO), are widely implemented and adapted\nin modern systems, supported even by commodity architectures like ARM and x86,\nour evaluation focuses not only on sequentially consistent memory models but\nalso on these relaxed memory models. Specifically, we assess two main aspects:\nthe models' capacity to detect concurrency problems under a sequentially\nconsistent memory model and their ability to verify the correctness conditions\nof concurrent programs across both sequentially consistent and relaxed memory\nmodels. To do this, we leverage SV-COMP's pthread tests and 25 ARM Litmus tests\ndesigned to evaluate Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO)\nmemory models. The experimental results reveal that GPT-4, GPT-4o, and\nMistral-AI's Large2 demonstrate a robust understanding of concurrency issues,\neffectively identifying data races and deadlocks when assessed under a\nsequentially consistent memory model.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the optimal infrastructure planning and order\nassignment problem of an on-demand food-delivery platform with a mixed fleet of\ndrones and human couriers. The platform has two delivery modes: (a) ground\ndelivery and (b) drone-assisted delivery (i.e., air delivery). In ground\ndelivery, couriers directly collect and transport orders from restaurants to\ndestinations. For air delivery, the delivery process involves three legs:\ninitially, a human courier picks up the order from the restaurant and\ntransports it to a nearby launchpad, where personnel load the orders onto\ndrones and replace batteries as needed. The loaded drone then transports the\norder from the launchpad to a kiosk, where another courier retrieves the order\nfrom the kiosk for final delivery. The platform must determine the optimal\nlocations for launchpads and kiosks within a transportation network, and devise\nan order assignment strategy that allocates food-delivery orders between ground\nand air delivery considering the bundling probabilities of ground deliveries\nand the waiting times at launchpads and kiosks. We formulate the platform's\nproblem as a mixed-integer nonlinear program and develop a novel neural\nnetwork-assisted optimization method to obtain high-quality solutions. A case\nstudy in Hong Kong validates our model and algorithm, revealing that drone\ndelivery reduces operational costs, minimizes courier fleet size, and increases\norder bundling opportunities. We also find that the expansion of air delivery\nservices may entail larger delivery times due to the trade-off between the\ntravel time savings induced by the faster air delivery and the associated\ndetours incurred by intermodal transfer and extra waiting times at launchpads\nand kiosks, which crucially depends on the distance of the orders and the\nsequence of activating long-distance air delivery routes versus short-distance\nones.",

Thanks to the Imaging X-ray\nPolarimetry Explorer (IXPE) the geometries of several XRPs have been\ndetermined, providing new insights into their emission mechanisms and magnetic\nfield structures. Previously, Vela X-1 has proven to be exceptional in\ndemonstrating a clear energy dependence of its polarimetric properties, showing\na 90$^{\\circ}$ swing in the polarization angle (PA) between low and high\nenergies. Due to the complex energy-dependent nature of the polarization\nproperties, it was not possible to determine the pulsar geometry. In this work,\nwe present the results of a detailed analysis of the pulse phase-resolved\npolarization properties of at different energies. By separating the\npolarimetric analysis into low and high energy ranges, we are able to\ndisentangle the contributions of the soft and hard spectral components to the\npolarization, revealing the pulse phase dependence of polarization degree (PD)\nand PA in each energy band. The PA pulse phase dependence at high energies\n(5$-$8 keV) allows us, for the first time, to determine the pulsar geometry in\nVela X-1. The fit with the rotating vector model gives an estimate for the\npulsar spin position angle at around 127$^{\\circ}$ and for the magnetic\nobliquity of 13$^{\\circ}$. In order to explain the 90$^{\\circ}$ swing in PA\nbetween high and low energies, we discuss two possible scenarios: a\ntwo-component spectral model and the vacuum resonance.",

Here, we systematically investigate\na quantum $(2+1)$-D Potts model with $Q=3$ using a fuzzy sphere regularization\nscheme.

Importantly, the\nenergy spectrum at the phase transition point exhibits an approximately\nconformal symmetry, implying that an underlying conformal field theory may\ngovern this transition. Moreover, when tuning along the phase transition line\nin the mapped phase diagram, we find that the dimension of the subleading $S_3$\nsinglet operator flows and drifts around the critical value $\\sim 3$, which is\nbelieved to be crucial for understanding this phase transition, although\ndetermining its precise value remains challenging due to the limitations of our\nfinite-size calculations.

However, current automatic mesh generation methods\ntypically rely on intermediate representations that lack the continuous surface\nquality inherent to meshes. Converting these representations into meshes\nproduces dense, suboptimal outputs. Although recent autoregressive approaches\ndemonstrate promise in directly modeling mesh vertices and faces, they are\nconstrained by the limitation in face count, scalability, and structural\nfidelity. To address these challenges, we propose Nautilus, a locality-aware\nautoencoder for artist-like mesh generation that leverages the local properties\nof manifold meshes to achieve structural fidelity and efficient representation.\nOur approach introduces a novel tokenization algorithm that preserves face\nproximity relationships and compresses sequence length through locally shared\nvertices and edges, enabling the generation of meshes with an unprecedented\nscale of up to 5,000 faces. Furthermore, we develop a Dual-stream Point\nConditioner that provides multi-scale geometric guidance, ensuring global\nconsistency and local structural fidelity by capturing fine-grained geometric\nfeatures.

Can we automatically generate such images using basic product\ninformation like a product foreground image, taglines, and a target size?\nExisting methods mainly focus on parts of the problem and lack a comprehensive\nsolution. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel product-centric framework for\nadvertising image design called T-Stars-Poster. It consists of four sequential\nstages to highlight product foregrounds and taglines while achieving overall\nimage aesthetics: prompt generation, layout generation, background image\ngeneration, and graphics rendering. Different expert models are designed and\ntrained for the first three stages: First, a visual language model (VLM)\ngenerates background prompts that match the products. Next, a VLM-based layout\ngeneration model arranges the placement of product foregrounds, graphic\nelements (taglines and decorative underlays), and various nongraphic elements\n(objects from the background prompt). Following this, an SDXL-based model can\nsimultaneously accept prompts, layouts, and foreground controls to generate\nimages. To support T-Stars-Poster, we create two corresponding datasets with\nover 50,000 labeled images. Extensive experiments and online A/B tests\ndemonstrate that T-Stars-Poster can produce more visually appealing advertising\nimages.",

While recent work has explored using\nLLM-generated data for fine-tuning, its impact on cross-domain generalization\nremains poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing\nthat fine-tuning with LLM-generated data not only improves target task\nperformance but also reduces non-target task degradation compared to\nfine-tuning with ground truth data. Through analyzing the data sequence in\ntasks of various domains, we demonstrate that this enhancement of non-target\ntask robustness stems from the reduction of high perplexity tokens found in\nLLM-generated sequences. Following our findings, we showed that masking high\nperplexity tokens in ground truth training data achieves similar non-target\ntask performance preservation, comparable to using LLM-generated data.\nExtensive experiments across different model families and scales, including\nGemma 2 IT 2B, Llama 3 8B Instruct, and 3 additional models, agree with our\nfindings.

One potential\napplication of these models in the educational field would be to provide\nfeedback to students in university introductory programming courses, so that a\nstudent struggling to solve a basic implementation problem could seek help from\nan LLM available 24/7. This article focuses on studying three aspects related\nto such an application. First, the performance of two well-known models,\nGPT-3.5T and GPT-4T, in providing feedback to students is evaluated. The\nempirical results showed that GPT-4T performs much better than GPT-3.5T,\nhowever, it is not yet ready for use in a real-world scenario. This is due to\nthe possibility of generating incorrect information that potential users may\nnot always be able to detect. Second, the article proposes a carefully designed\nprompt using in-context learning techniques that allows automating important\nparts of the evaluation process, as well as providing a lower bound for the\nfraction of feedbacks containing incorrect information, saving time and effort.\nThis was possible because the resulting feedback has a programmatically\nanalyzable structure that incorporates diagnostic information about the LLM's\nperformance in solving the requested task. Third, the article also suggests a\npossible strategy for implementing a practical learning tool based on LLMs,\nwhich is rooted on the proposed prompting techniques.

However, the domain of road damage detection remains relatively\nunder explored, despite its critical significance for applications such as\ninfrastructure maintenance and road safety. This paper addresses this gap by\nintroducing a novel top down benchmark that offers a complementary perspective\nto existing datasets, specifically tailored for road damage detection. Our\nproposed Top Down Road Damage Detection Dataset (TDRD) includes three primary\ncategories of road damage cracks, potholes, and patches captured from a top\ndown viewpoint. The dataset consists of 7,088 high resolution images,\nencompassing 12,882 annotated instances of road damage. Additionally, we\npresent a novel real time object detection framework, TDYOLOV10, designed to\nhandle the unique challenges posed by the TDRD dataset. Comparative studies\nwith state of the art models demonstrate competitive baseline results. By\nreleasing TDRD, we aim to accelerate research in this crucial area. A sample of\nthe dataset will be made publicly available upon the paper's acceptance.",

In this paper,\nwe propose the Fast Think-on-Graph (FastToG), an innovative paradigm for\nenabling LLMs to think ``community by community\" within KGs.

In the classical theory of computation,\ne.g. in the Turing Machine model, computational processes employ only local\nspace and time resources, and their resource usage can be accurately measured\nby us as users. General relativity and quantum theory, however, introduce the\npossibility of computational processes that employ nonlocal spatial or temporal\nresources. While the space and time complexity of classical computing can be\ngiven a clear operational meaning, this is no longer the case in any setting\ninvolving nonlocal resources. In such settings, theoretical analyses of\nresource usage cease to be reliable indicators of practical computational\ncapability. We prove that the verifier (C) in a multiple interactive provers\nwith shared entanglement (MIP*) protocol cannot operationally demonstrate that\nthe \"multiple\" provers are independent, i.e. cannot operationally distinguish a\nMIP* machine from a monolithic quantum computer. Thus C cannot operationally\ndistinguish a MIP* machine from a quantum TM, and hence cannot operationally\ndemonstrate the solution to arbitrary problems in RE. Any claim that a MIP*\nmachine has solved a TM-undecidable problem is, therefore, circular, as the\nproblem of deciding whether a physical system is a MIP* machine is itself\nTM-undecidable. Consequently, despite the space and time complexity of\nclassical computing having a clear operational meaning, this is no longer the\ncase in any setting involving nonlocal resources.

    "abstract": "In autumn 2023, a series of closely timed eruptive events were observed\nremotely and measured in situ. We studied analogous solar events, where several\nCMEs were launched partly from the same (active) regions near a CH. These\nevents occurred in two episodes, separated by a full solar rotation, covering\nOctober 31-November 3 and November 27-28, 2023. Both episodes are linked to\nstrong geomagnetic storms on November 4-5 and December 1-2, 2023. We aim to\nunderstand the complexity of these events and how the global magnetic field,\nsolar wind conditions, and structural interactions relate to the observed\ngeomagnetic effects. Using the GCS 3D reconstruction method, we derived each\nCME's motion direction and speed. These results were input into the DBM with\nenhanced latitudinal information (3D DBM), aiding in connecting in-situ\nmeasurements with solar surface structures for integrated interpretation. The\nfirst episode caused SAR arcs, with a three-step Dst index drop to -163 nT on\nNovember 5, 2023. Two CME-related shocks arrived close in time, separated by a\nSBC, followed by a short-duration flux rope-like structure. The second episode\nsaw auroral lights and a two-step Dst index drop to -108 nT on December 1,\n2023. A shock from one CME interacted with the magnetic structure of a\npreceding CME, again combined with an SBC. A clear flux rope structure from the\nshock-producing CME was detected. Both events showed distinct magnetic field\n'ripples' and fluctuations in density and temperature following the SBC. This\nstudy compares two episodes of multiple eruptive events in November and\nDecember 2023. Interacting CME structures and SBC-related magnetic modulations\ncontributed to the stronger geomagnetic impacts, particularly in the November\n4-5, 2023 event. The highly tilted heliospheric current sheet may have further\ninfluenced the CMEs' impact at Earth.",

However,\nthe extent and conditions under which LLMs deviate from empirical positions are\ninsufficiently examined. To address this gap, we analyze the factors that\ncontribute to LLMs' deviations from empirical positions on political issues,\naiming to quantify these deviations and identify the conditions that cause\nthem.\n  Drawing on findings from cognitive science about representativeness\nheuristics, i.e., situations where humans lean on representative attributes of\na target group in a way that leads to exaggerated beliefs, we scrutinize LLM\nresponses through this heuristics' lens. We conduct experiments to determine\nhow LLMs inflate predictions about political parties, which results in\nstereotyping. We find that while LLMs can mimic certain political parties'\npositions, they often exaggerate these positions more than human survey\nrespondents do. Also, LLMs tend to overemphasize representativeness more than\nhumans. This study highlights the susceptibility of LLMs to representativeness\nheuristics, suggesting a potential vulnerability of LLMs that facilitates\npolitical stereotyping.

This metric is typically\nquantified for wireless networks by averaging the QoS success indicator over\nspatial and temporal random variables. Recently, the meta distribution (MD) has\nemerged as a two-level performance analysis tool for wireless networks,\noffering a detailed examination of the outer level (i.e., system-level)\nreliability versus the inner level (i.e., link-level) reliability thresholds.\nMost existing studies focus on first-order spatiotemporal MD reliability\nanalyses, and the benefits of leveraging MD reliability for applications beyond\nthis structure remain unexplored, a gap addressed in this paper. We propose a\nframework for the analysis of higher-order MD reliability of wireless networks\nconsidering different levels of temporal dynamicity of random elements in the\nnetwork where the MD at each layer is leveraged to be used in calculating the\nMD of the higher layer. We then provide two applications for this framework and\nprovide a detailed analytical and numerical study of the higher-order MD\nreliability for both examples. The results demonstrate the value of the\nhierarchical representation of MD reliability across three domains and the\nimpact of the inner-layers target reliabilities on the overall MD reliability\nmeasure.",

Using open-source LLMs, we develop a\nmethod to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in\nAoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their\nreasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic\npipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with\ntimestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a\ncontamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we\nobserve a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their\nsuccess on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true\nreasoning ability. Our work presents a scalable approach to creating and\nmaintaining large-scale, high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning,\noffering valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in\nthis domain.

    "abstract": "Recently, emotional speech generation and speaker cloning have garnered\nsignificant interest in text-to-speech (TTS). With the open-sourcing of codec\nlanguage TTS models trained on massive datasets with large-scale parameters,\nadapting these general pre-trained TTS models to generate speech with specific\nemotional expressions and target speaker characteristics has become a topic of\ngreat attention. Common approaches, such as full and adapter-based fine-tuning,\noften overlook the specific contributions of model parameters to emotion and\nspeaker control. Treating all parameters uniformly during fine-tuning,\nespecially when the target data has limited content diversity compared to the\npre-training corpus, results in slow training speed and an increased risk of\ncatastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose a\ncharacteristic-specific partial fine-tuning strategy, short as CSP-FT. First,\nwe use a weighted-sum approach to analyze the contributions of different\nTransformer layers in a pre-trained codec language TTS model for emotion and\nspeaker control in the generated speech. We then selectively fine-tune the\nlayers with the highest and lowest characteristic-specific contributions to\ngenerate speech with target emotional expression and speaker identity.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance\ncomparable to, or even surpassing, full fine-tuning in generating speech with\nspecific emotional expressions and speaker identities. Additionally, CSP-FT\ndelivers approximately 2x faster training speeds, fine-tunes only around 8% of\nparameters, and significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we\nshow that codec language TTS models perform competitively with self-supervised\nmodels in speaker identification and emotion classification tasks, offering\nvaluable insights for developing universal speech processing models.",

Additionally, we found that the source of the seed\nphotons has big influence in the significance of the NS radiation, especially\nfor the soft spectral state. This result may help explain why the NS radiation\nin MAXI J1816-195 is weak in the previous work. More importantly, for the first\ntime, we explored the properties of the corona in the NS systems with the\ncompactness ($l-\\theta$) diagram. We found that the corona in the NS systems\nall lie in the left side of the pair-production forbidden region, away from the\npredicted pair-production lines.

However, most of them overlook the\ninterference caused by redundant interest-irrelevant information contained in\nrich multi-modal data. Additionally, they primarily rely on implicit temporal\ninformation based solely on chronological ordering, neglecting explicit\ntemporal signals that could more effectively represent dynamic user interest\nover time. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical time-aware\nMixture of experts for multi-modal Sequential Recommendation (HM4SR) with a\ntwo-level Mixture of Experts (MoE) and a multi-task learning strategy.\nSpecifically, the first MoE, named Interactive MoE, extracts essential user\ninterest-related information from the multi-modal data of each item. Then, the\nsecond MoE, termed Temporal MoE, captures user dynamic interests by introducing\nexplicit temporal embeddings from timestamps in modality encoding. To further\naddress data sparsity, we propose three auxiliary supervision tasks:\nsequence-level category prediction (CP) for item feature understanding,\ncontrastive learning on ID (IDCL) to align sequence context with user\ninterests, and placeholder contrastive learning (PCL) to integrate temporal\ninformation with modalities for dynamic interest modeling.

Our framework\nutilizes a causal encoder to extract semantically meaningful embeddings of the\nobserved trajectory, as well as a normalizing flow to decode these embeddings\nand determine the most likely future location of an agent at some time point in\nthe future. Our formulation differs from existing approaches because we model\nthe marginal distribution of spatial locations instead of the joint\ndistribution of unobserved trajectories. The advantages of a marginal\nformulation are numerous. First, we demonstrate that the marginal formulation\nproduces higher accuracy on challenging trajectory forecasting benchmarks.\nSecond, the marginal formulation allows for fully continuous sampling of future\nlocations. Finally, marginal densities are better suited for downstream tasks\nas they allow for the computation of per-agent motion trajectories and\noccupancy grids, the two most commonly used representations for motion\nforecasting.

    "abstract": "To explain the similarity between e-cigarette aerosol and e-liquid\ncomposition despite differing component boiling points, a non-selective\nevaporation mechanism for binary aerosol generating agents was investigated\nusing phase diagrams and capillary evaporation theory. Experiments including\nevaporation temperature measurement, airflow heating, and capillary evaporation\nobservation validated the non-selective evaporation process. Key findings: 1)\nNon-selective evaporation occurs due to liquid convection obstruction in\ncapillaries, forming an evaporation layer with a composition distinct from the\nmain liquid phase. Stable non-selective evaporation arises when the gas-phase\ncomposition matches the liquid-phase components transferred to the evaporation\nlayer. 2) Evaporation temperature (T) deviated significantly from the bubble\npoint temperature (Tb) and aligned closely with the dew point temperature (Tc),\nindicating a stable evaporation layer with a unique composition. 3) Surface\nheating and porous material experiments demonstrated significant deviations\nfrom ideal selective evaporation in water/methanol, water/propylene glycol, and\npropylene glycol/glycerol systems, highlighting the roles of \"surface heating\"\nand \"mass transfer resistance\" in non-selective evaporation. 4) A two-stage\ncapillary evaporation experiment revealed a transition in evaporation rate,\nconfirming a shift in the evaporation layer's composition during stable\nnon-selective evaporation. 5) Particle tracing confirmed unidirectional liquid\nflow in capillaries, with micro-convection near the meniscus, further\nsupporting the \"evaporation layer\" concept. These findings provide a\nmechanistic understanding of non-selective evaporation in e-cigarette aerosols.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in converting C code to\nRust, to benefit from the memory and thread safety guarantees of Rust. C2Rust\nis a rule-based system that can automatically convert C code to functionally\nidentical Rust, but the Rust code that it produces is non-idiomatic, i.e.,\nmakes extensive use of unsafe Rust, a subset of the language that doesn't have\nmemory or thread safety guarantees. At the other end of the spectrum are LLMs,\nwhich produce idiomatic Rust code, but these have the potential to make\nmistakes and are constrained in the length of code they can process. In this\npaper, we present C2SaferRust, a novel approach to translate C to Rust that\ncombines the strengths of C2Rust and LLMs. We first use C2Rust to convert C\ncode to non-idiomatic, unsafe Rust. We then decompose the unsafe Rust code into\nslices that can be individually translated to safer Rust by an LLM. After\nprocessing each slice, we run end-to-end test cases to verify that the code\nstill functions as expected. We also contribute a benchmark of 7 real-world\nprograms, translated from C to unsafe Rust using C2Rust. Each of these programs\nalso comes with end-to-end test cases. On this benchmark, we are able to reduce\nthe number of raw pointers by up to 38%, and reduce the amount of unsafe code\nby up to 28%, indicating an increase in safety. The resulting programs still\npass all test cases. C2SaferRust also shows convincing gains in performance\nagainst two previous techniques for making Rust code safer.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental component of Intelligent Tutoring\nSystems (ITS), enabling the modeling of students' knowledge states to predict\nfuture performance. The introduction of Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), the first\ndeep learning-based KT (DLKT) model, has brought significant advantages in\nterms of applicability and comprehensiveness. However, recent DLKT models, such\nas Attentive Knowledge Tracing (AKT), have often prioritized predictive\nperformance at the expense of these benefits. While deep sequential models like\nDKT have shown potential, they face challenges related to parallel computing,\nstorage decision modification, and limited storage capacity. To address these\nlimitations, we propose DKT2, a novel KT model that leverages the recently\ndeveloped xLSTM architecture. DKT2 enhances applicable input representation\nusing the Rasch model and incorporates Item Response Theory (IRT) for output\ninterpretability, allowing for the decomposition of learned knowledge into\nfamiliar and unfamiliar knowledge. By integrating this knowledge with predicted\nquestions, DKT2 generates comprehensive knowledge states. Extensive experiments\nconducted across three large-scale datasets demonstrate that DKT2 consistently\noutperforms 18 baseline models in various prediction tasks, underscoring its\npotential for real-world educational applications.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in real-world applications,\nraising concerns about their safety and trustworthiness. While red-teaming with\njailbreak prompts exposes the vulnerabilities of LLMs, current efforts focus\nprimarily on single-turn attacks, overlooking the multi-turn strategies used by\nreal-world adversaries. Existing multi-turn methods rely on static patterns or\npredefined logical chains, failing to account for the dynamic strategies during\nattacks. We propose Siren, a learning-based multi-turn attack framework\ndesigned to simulate real-world human jailbreak behaviors. Siren consists of\nthree stages: (1) training set construction utilizing Turn-Level LLM feedback\n(Turn-MF), (2) post-training attackers with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\ndirect preference optimization (DPO), and (3) interactions between the\nattacking and target LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that Siren achieves an\nattack success rate (ASR) of 90% with LLaMA-3-8B as the attacker against\nGemini-1.5-Pro as the target model, and 70% with Mistral-7B against GPT-4o,\nsignificantly outperforming single-turn baselines. Moreover, Siren with a\n7B-scale model achieves performance comparable to a multi-turn baseline that\nleverages GPT-4o as the attacker, while requiring fewer turns and employing\ndecomposition strategies that are better semantically aligned with attack\ngoals. We hope Siren inspires the development of stronger defenses against\nadvanced multi-turn jailbreak attacks under realistic scenarios. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/YiyiyiZhao/siren.

In\nresponse, we introduce Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at\nthe frontier of human knowledge, designed to be the final closed-ended academic\nbenchmark of its kind with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 2,500\nquestions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities, and the\nnatural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and\nconsists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated\ngrading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily\nverifiable, but cannot be quickly answered via internet retrieval.\nState-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE,\nhighlighting a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert\nhuman frontier on closed-ended academic questions.

    "abstract": "Normalization is a critical step in quantitative analyses of biological\nprocesses. Recent works show that cross-platform integration and normalization\nenable machine learning (ML) training on RNA microarray and RNA-seq data, but\nno independent datasets were used in their studies. Therefore, it is unclear\nhow to improve ML modelling performance on independent RNA array and RNA-seq\nbased datasets. Inspired by the house-keeping genes that are commonly used in\nexperimental biology, this study tests the hypothesis that non-differentially\nexpressed genes (NDEG) may improve normalization of transcriptomic data and\nsubsequently cross-platform modelling performance of ML models. Microarray and\nRNA-seq datasets of the TCGA breast cancer were used as independent training\nand test datasets, respectively, to classify the molecular subtypes of breast\ncancer. NDEG (p>0.85) and differentially expressed genes (DEG, p<0.05) were\nselected based on the p values of ANOVA analysis and used for subsequent data\nnormalization and classification, respectively. Models trained based on data\nfrom one platform were used for testing on the other platform. Our data show\nthat NDEG and DEG gene selection could effectively improve the model\nclassification performance. Normalization methods based on parametric\nstatistical analysis were inferior to those based on nonparametric statistics.\nIn this study, the LOG_QN and LOG_QNZ normalization methods combined with the\nneural network classification model seem to achieve better performance.\nTherefore, NDEG-based normalization appears useful for cross-platform testing\non completely independent datasets. However, more studies are required to\nexamine whether NDEG-based normalization can improve ML classification\nperformance in other datasets and other omic data types.",

Among a\nsub-population that emit repeated radio bursts, a handful were associated with\na persistent radio source (PRS) whose origin is unknown. Here we report the\ndiscovery of a compact flaring radio source (FRS) associated with a\nnewly-active repeating FRB within one month after the first radio burst was\ndetected. Its temporal and spectral characteristics differ from those of the\nPRSs but are similar to those of engine-powered supernovae and low-luminosity\nactive galactic nuclei. We detected a spectral peak around $1.6\\pm0.2$ GHz that\nis consistent with synchrotron self-absorption. Assuming equipartition, the\nmagnetic field strength in the FRS is larger than the line-of-sight component\nconstrained from the FRB Faraday rotation, suggesting a highly magnetized\nengine. The radius of the FRS is constrained to be $\\sim0.03$ pc and the\nminimum total energy is $\\sim~6.2\\times{10}^{47}~{\\rm ergs~}$. This FRS reveals\nthe birth of a highly magnetized FRB engine, and hints that PRSs associated\nwith other active FRBs may be in the later stage of evolution.",

To\nfully leverage these neural patterns, we propose an Adaptive Progressive\nAttention Graph Neural Network (APAGNN), which dynamically captures the spatial\nrelationships among brain regions during emotional processing. The APAGNN\nemploys three specialized experts that progressively analyze brain topology.\nThe first expert captures global brain patterns, the second focuses on\nregion-specific features, and the third examines emotion-related channels. This\nhierarchical approach enables increasingly refined analysis of neural activity.\nAdditionally, a weight generator integrates the outputs of all three experts,\nbalancing their contributions to produce the final predictive label. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on SEED, SEED-IV and MPED datasets indicate that our\nmethod enhances EEG emotion recognition performance, achieving superior results\ncompared to baseline methods.",

We performed numerical integration of the exact equations of motion\nfor a dense ensemble of Atlas clone satellites. Through spectral analysis and\ninterpretation of these orbits on dynamical maps, we identified the domain of\nthe 54:53 Prometheus-Atlas and 70:67 Pandora-Atlas mean-motion resonances,\nshowing that Atlas lies on the boundary of the separatrices of each of these\nresonances. We also identified the domains for the multiplets $\\Psi_{1}$,\n$\\Psi_{2}$, $\\Psi_{3}$ and $\\Psi_{4}$ associated with 70:67 resonance.\nAdditionally, we explored the variation in Prometheus's eccentricity,\ndemonstrating that as eccentricity increases (or decreases) in the 54:53\nresonance domain correspondingly decreases (or increases). This combined\nanalysis, between the above mappings, revealed qualitatively the overlap\nbetween the 54:53 and 70:67 resonances, which are responsible for the chaotic\nbehavior of Atlas's orbit. We quantified chaotic motion in frequency space and\nfound that the vicinity of Atlas is characterized by weak to moderate chaos,\nrather than strong chaos. Finally, we investigated Atlas's recent past,\nconsidering Prometheus's migration under the influence of Saturn's tidal\nforces. This analysis reveals several resonances crossed in the past,\nparticularly focusing on the Atlas-Prometheus pair, which exhibited a\nco-orbital configuration.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 highlight key\nfeatures of multiscale physics that can be captured using the two-fluid model.\nIn this paper, we demonstrated that classical and quantum hydrodynamic\ntwo-fluid models are connected via scale transformations: large eddy simulation\n(LES) filtering links microscopic to macroscopic scales, while inverse scale\ntransformation through SPH connects macro back to microscales. We showed that\nthe spin angular momentum conservation term, introduced as a quantum-like\ncorrection, formally corresponds to a subgrid-scale (SGS) model derived from\nthis transformation. Moreover, solving the classical hydrodynamic two-fluid\nmodel with SPH appears to reproduce microscopic-scale fluctuations at\nmacroscopic scales. The amplitude of these fluctuations depends on the kernel\nradius. This effect may arise from truncation errors from kernel smoothing,\nwhich can qualitatively resemble such fluctuations. However, this resemblance\nlacks first-principle justification and should be viewed as a speculative\nanalogy rather than a physically grounded effect. Our theoretical analysis\nfurther suggests that the Condiff viscosity model can act as an SGS model,\nincorporating quantum vortex interactions under point-vortex approximation into\nthe two-fluid framework. These findings provide new insight into the\nmicroscopic structure of cryogenic helium-4 within a multiscale context.\nNotably, the normal fluid can be understood as a mixture of inviscid and\nviscous fluid particles. While molecular viscosity renders the normal fluid at\nmicroscopic scales, its small magnitude contributes little to the large-scale\neffective viscosity, which includes both molecular and eddy viscosities;\ntherefore, in laminar regimes where eddy viscosity is negligible, the normal\nfluid may be effectively treated as inviscid at large scales if molecular\nviscosity is sufficiently small.",

However, conventional reflection-only RISs can only\nachieve half-space reflection, which limits the LoS path diversity. In\ncontrast, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RISs (STAR-RISs) can\nachieve full-space reflection and transmission, thereby creating more LoS\npaths. Hence, in this paper, we study a new multi-STAR-RIS-aided communication\nsystem, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits to multiple\nsingle-antenna users by exploiting the signal beam routing over a set of\ncascaded LoS paths each formed by multiple STAR-RISs. To reveal essential\ninsights, we first consider a simplified single-user case, aiming to maximize\nits received signal power by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the\nBS, the BS's power allocation over different paths, the number of selected\nbeam-routing paths, the selected STAR-RISs for each path, as well as their\namplitude and phase shifts for transmission/reflection. However, this problem\nis difficult to be optimally solved as different paths may be intricately\ncoupled at their shared STAR-RISs. To tackle this difficulty, we first derive\nthe optimal solution to this problem in closed-form for a given set of paths.\nThe clique-based approach in graph theory is then applied to solve the\nremaining multi-path selection problem efficiently. Next, we extend the\nproposed clique-based method to the multi-user case to maximize the minimum\nreceived signal power among all users, subject to additional constraints on the\ndisjointness of the selected paths for different users. Simulation results show\nthat our proposed STAR-RIS-enabled beam routing outperforms the conventional\nbeam routing with reflection-only RISs in both single- and multi-user cases.",

    "abstract": "For the quantum error correction (QEC) and noisy intermediate-scale quantum\n(NISQ) algorithms to function with high efficiency, the raw fidelity of quantum\nlogic gates on physical qubits needs to satisfy strict requirement. The neutral\natom quantum computing equipped with Rydberg blockade gates has made impressive\nprogress recently, which makes it worthwhile to explore its potential in the\ntwo-qubit entangling gates, including Controlled-PHASE gate and in particular\nthe CZ gate. Provided the quantum coherence is well preserved, improving the\nfidelity of Rydberg blockade gates calls for special mechanisms to deal with\nadverse effects caused by realistic experimental conditions. Here the heralded\nvery-high-fidelity Rydberg blockade Controlled-PHASE gate is designed to\naddress these issues, which contains self-correction and projection as the key\nsteps. This trailblazing method can be built on the basis of the previously\nestablished buffer-atom-mediated gate, and a special form of symmetry under PT\ntransformation plays a crucial role in the process. We further analyze the\nperformance with respect to a few typical sources of imperfections. This\nprocedure can also be regarded as quantum hardware error correction or\nmitigation. While this paper by itself does not cover every single subtle issue\nand still contains many over-simplifications, we find it reasonable to\nanticipate very-high-fidelity two-qubit quantum logic gate operated in the\nsense of heralded but probabilistic, whose gate error can reduce to the level\nof $10^{-4}$--$10^{-6}$ or even lower with reasonably high possibilities.",

    "abstract": "A common characteristic in integer linear programs (ILPs) is symmetry,\nallowing variables to be permuted without altering the underlying problem\nstructure. Recently, GNNs have emerged as a promising approach for solving\nILPs. However, a significant challenge arises when applying GNNs to ILPs with\nsymmetry: classic GNN architectures struggle to differentiate between symmetric\nvariables, which limits their predictive accuracy. In this work, we investigate\nthe properties of permutation equivariance and invariance in GNNs, particularly\nin relation to the inherent symmetry of ILP formulations. We reveal that the\ninteraction between these two factors contributes to the difficulty of\ndistinguishing between symmetric variables. To address this challenge, we\nexplore the potential of feature augmentation and propose several guiding\nprinciples for constructing augmented features. Building on these principles,\nwe develop an orbit-based augmentation scheme that first groups symmetric\nvariables and then samples augmented features for each group from a discrete\nuniform distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed approach\nsignificantly enhances both training efficiency and predictive performance.",

PuzzleGPT consists of\na perceiver to identify visual clues, a reasoner to deduce prediction\ncandidates, a combiner to combinatorially combine information from different\nclues, a web retriever to get external knowledge if the task can't be solved\nlocally, and a noise filter for robustness. This results in a zero-shot,\ninterpretable, and robust approach that records state-of-the-art performance on\ntwo datasets -- TARA and WikiTilo. PuzzleGPT outperforms large VLMs such as\nBLIP-2, InstructBLIP, LLaVA, and even GPT-4V, as well as automatically\ngenerated reasoning pipelines like VisProg, by at least 32% and 38%,\nrespectively.

As presented here, most theorems are special cases of known,\nmore general results about dynamical systems whose orbits or trajectories\nfollow this logarithmic law, in one way or another. These results span a wide\nvariety of systems: autonomous and non-autonomous; discrete- and\ncontinuous-time; one- and multi-dimensional; deterministic and stochastic.\nIllustrative examples include familiar systems such as the tent map, Newton's\nroot-finding algorithm, and geometric Brownian motion.

    "abstract": "Bimanual robotic manipulation is a long-standing challenge of embodied\nintelligence due to its characteristics of dual-arm spatial-temporal\ncoordination and high-dimensional action spaces. Previous studies rely on\npre-defined action taxonomies or direct teleoperation to alleviate or\ncircumvent these issues, often making them lack simplicity, versatility and\nscalability. Differently, we believe that the most effective and efficient way\nfor teaching bimanual manipulation is learning from human demonstrated videos,\nwhere rich features such as spatial-temporal positions, dynamic postures,\ninteraction states and dexterous transitions are available almost for free. In\nthis work, we propose the YOTO (You Only Teach Once), which can extract and\nthen inject patterns of bimanual actions from as few as a single binocular\nobservation of hand movements, and teach dual robot arms various complex tasks.\nFurthermore, based on keyframes-based motion trajectories, we devise a subtle\nsolution for rapidly generating training demonstrations with diverse variations\nof manipulated objects and their locations. These data can then be used to\nlearn a customized bimanual diffusion policy (BiDP) across diverse scenes. In\nexperiments, YOTO achieves impressive performance in mimicking 5 intricate\nlong-horizon bimanual tasks, possesses strong generalization under different\nvisual and spatial conditions, and outperforms existing visuomotor imitation\nlearning methods in accuracy and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform zero-shot learning on unseen tasks\nand few-shot learning on complex reasoning tasks. However, resource-limited\nmobile edge networks struggle to support long-context LLM serving for LLM\nagents during multi-round interactions with users. Unlike stateless computation\noffloading and static service offloading in edge computing, optimizing LLM\nserving at edge servers is challenging because LLMs continuously learn from\ncontext which raises accuracy, latency, and resource consumption dynamics. In\nthis paper, we propose a joint model caching and inference offloading framework\nthat utilizes test-time deep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) to optimize\ndeployment and execution strategies for long-context LLM serving. In this\nframework, we analyze the performance convergence and design an optimization\nproblem considering the utilization of context windows in LLMs. Furthermore,\nthe T2DRL algorithm can learn in both the training phase and the testing phase\nto proactively manage cached models and service requests and adapt to context\nchanges and usage patterns during execution. To further enhance resource\nallocation efficiency, we propose a double Dutch auction (DDA) mechanism, which\ndynamically matches supply and demand while maximizing social welfare. Finally,\nexperimental results demonstrate that the T2DRL algorithm can reduce system\ncosts by at least 30% compared to baselines while guaranteeing the performance\nof LLM agents in real-world perception and reasoning tasks.",

Existing methods like FASTV\nand VTW have achieved notable results in reducing redundant visual tokens, but\nthese approaches focus on pruning tokens in a single forward pass without\nsystematically analyzing the redundancy of visual tokens throughout the entire\ngeneration process. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic pruning strategy\ntailored for VLMs, namedDynamic Rate (DyRate), which progressively adjusts the\ncompression rate during generation. Our analysis of the distribution of\nattention reveals that the importance of visual tokens decreases throughout the\ngeneration process, inspiring us to adopt a more aggressive compression rate.\nBy integrating a lightweight predictor based on attention distribution, our\napproach enables flexible adjustment of pruning rates based on the attention\ndistribution. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method not only\nreduces computational demands but also maintains the quality of responses.",

The survey covers the sky area of -89<Dec<0 and the frequency range\nof 1.3-1.8 GHz split into 1-MHz channels. STAPS was observed commensally with\nthe S-band Polarization All-Sky Survey (S-PASS). The survey is composed of long\nazimuth scans, which allows us to absolutely calibrate Stokes Q and U with the\ndata processing procedure developed for S-PASS. We obtain I, Q, and U maps in\nboth flux density scale (Jy/beam) and main beam brightness temperature scale\n(K), for the 301 frequency channels with sufficiently good data. The\ntemperature scale is tied to the Global Magneto-ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS)\nhigh-band north sky survey conducted with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical\nObservatory 26-m telescope. All the STAPS maps are smoothed to a common\nresolution of 20 arcmin. The rms noise per channel ranges from about 16 mK to 8\nmK for I, and from about 8 mK to 5 mK for Q and U at frequencies from 1.3 to\n1.8 GHz. The rms noise in Q and U varies with declination and reaches minimum\nat declination of -89 degree. We also run rotation measure (RM) synthesis and\nRM clean to obtain peak polarized intensity and Faraday depth maps. The whole\nSTAPS data processing is validated by comparing flux densities of compact\nsources, pixel flux density versus pixel flux density for Cen A, pixel\ntemperature versus pixel temperature for the entire survey area, and RMs of\nextragalactic sources between STAPS and other measurements. The uncertainty of\nthe flux density scale is less than 10%. STAPS delivers an L-band (20 cm)\nmulti-frequency polarization view of the Galaxy, and will help advance our\nunderstanding of the Galactic magnetic field and magnetized interstellar\nmedium.",

This tetragonal structure is widely believed to be crucial for the\npressure-induced superconductivity. Whether the pressure-stabilized tetragonal\nstructure is a prerequisite for achieving nickelate superconductivity at\nambient pressure is under hot debate. Here, by post-annealing of the\northorhombic La3Ni2O7-x as grown microcrystals with noticeable oxygen defects\nin high oxygen pressure environment, tetragonal La3Ni2O6.96 single crystals are\nsuccessfully obtained at ambient pressure. In contrast to the orthorhombic\nLa3Ni2O7-x, the tetragonal La3Ni2O7-x exhibits metallic behavior without a SDW\ntransition at ambient pressure. Moreover, no superconductivity is observed at\nhigh pressure up to ~ 70 GPa. On the other hand, by utilizing Helium as the\npressure medium, we have revisited the superconducting structure in pressurized\northorhombic La3Ni2O6.93. Our results indicate that the orthorhombic structure\nis quite robust against pressure, and no structural transition from\northorhombic to tetragonal happens, and the superconductivity under high\npressure is achieved in orthorhombic structure rather than tetragonal structure\nclaimed previously. All these results suggest that tetragonal structure is not\nprerequisite for achieving superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-x.",

    "abstract": "Spin-orbit torque (SOT) has been extensively studied as a key mechanism in\nspintronics applications. However, conventional SOT materials limit the spin\npolarization direction to the in-plane orientation, which is suboptimal for\nefficient magnetization switching. Recently, spin currents with spin\npolarization along multiple directions have been observed in low-symmetry\nmaterials, offering a promising energy-efficient strategy for the field-free\nswitching of magnetic materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.\nHowever, the efficiency of this mechanism is highly dependent on the\ncrystallographic texture of the SOT materials, a critical factor that, to date,\nhas not been quantitatively investigated. In this study, we present a\ncomprehensive numerical investigation into the impact of both in-plane and\nout-of-plane crystallographic textures of SOT materials on the unconventional\nSOT generated by Dresselhaus-like and out-of-plane spin polarizations. By\nemploying a theoretical orientation distribution function, we calculate the\neffective unconventional SOT values for SOT materials with tunable\ncrystallographic texture. This analysis provides a framework for the synthesis\nand optimization of future low-symmetry SOT materials, which can enhance\noperational efficiency for spintronics applications in magnetoresistive\nrandom-access memory and spin logic devices.",

During the offline training phase, we develop a Conservative Double\nDeep Q Network (CDDQN) as the action executor and a supervised learning-based\nreward estimator, termed the Guider Network, to extract valuable insights into\naction-reward relationships from data batches. In the online fine-tuning phase,\nthe Guider Network serves as an exploration guide, aiding CDDQN in effectively\nand conservatively exploring unknown state-action pairs. The efficacy of our\nalgorithm is demonstrated through a realistic case study using real-world data\nfrom Manhattan. We show that integrating ride-pooling with public transit\noutperforms two benchmark cases solo rides coordinated with transit and\nride-pooling without transit coordination by 17% and 22% in the achieved system\nrewards, respectively. Furthermore, our innovative offline training and online\nfine-tuning framework offers a remarkable 81.3% improvement in data efficiency\ncompared to traditional online RL methods with adequate exploration budgets,\nwith a 4.3% increase in total rewards and a 5.6% reduction in overestimation\nerrors. Experimental results further demonstrate that RG-CQL effectively\naddresses the challenges of transitioning from offline to online RL in\nlarge-scale ride-pooling systems integrated with transit.",

Most previous studies are\nmodel-driven, focusing on enhancing the detection effect by improving the model\nstructure.

Therefore, we\nintroduce graph curriculum learning as a simple and effective plug-and-play\nmodule to optimize GAD methods. The existing graph curriculum learning mainly\nfocuses on the homogeneity of graphs and treats nodes with high homogeneity as\neasy nodes. In fact, GAD models can handle not only graph homogeneity but also\nheterogeneity, which leads to the unsuitability of these existing methods. To\naddress this problem, we propose an innovative Bi-directional Curriculum\nLearning strategy (BCL), which considers nodes with higher and lower similarity\nto neighbor nodes as simple nodes in the direction of focusing on homogeneity\nand focusing on heterogeneity, respectively, and prioritizes their training.\nExtensive experiments show that BCL can be quickly integrated into existing\ndetection processes and significantly improves the performance of ten GAD\nanomaly detection models on seven commonly used datasets.",

Drawing inspiration from physics, the framework provides both a\ntheoretical and pragmatic perspective, offering a pictorial and quantitative\nrepresentation of how on-demand platforms create value. It seeks to demystify\ntheir nuanced operations by providing practical, tangible, and highly\napplicable metrics, platform design templates, and real-time optimization tools\nfor strategic what-if scenario planning. Its model demonstrates strong\npredictive power and is deeply rooted in raw data. The framework offers a\ndeterministic insight into the workings of diverse platforms like Uber, Airbnb,\nand food delivery services. Furthermore, it generalizes to model all on-demand\nservice platforms with cyclical operations. It works synergistically with\nmachine learning, game theory, and agent-based models by providing a solid\nquantitative core rooted in raw data, based on physical truths, and is capable\nof delivering tangible predictions for real-time operational adjustments. The\nframework's mathematical model was rigorously validated using highly detailed\nhistorical data retrieved with near 100% certainty. Applying data-driven\ninduction, distinct qualities were identified in big data sets via an iterative\nprocess. Through analogical thinking, a clear and highly intuitive mapping\nbetween the elements, operational principles, and dynamic behaviors of a\nwell-known physical system was established to create a physics-inspired lens\nfor Uber.

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has advanced significantly,\nparticularly with the development of video generation models such as\ntext-to-video (T2V) models and image-to-video (I2V) models. However, like other\nAIGC types, video generation requires robust content control. A common approach\nis to embed watermarks, but most research has focused on images, with limited\nattention given to videos. Traditional methods, which embed watermarks\nframe-by-frame in a post-processing manner, often degrade video quality. In\nthis paper, we propose VideoShield, a novel watermarking framework specifically\ndesigned for popular diffusion-based video generation models. Unlike\npost-processing methods, VideoShield embeds watermarks directly during video\ngeneration, eliminating the need for additional training. To ensure video\nintegrity, we introduce a tamper localization feature that can detect changes\nboth temporally (across frames) and spatially (within individual frames). Our\nmethod maps watermark bits to template bits, which are then used to generate\nwatermarked noise during the denoising process. Using DDIM Inversion, we can\nreverse the video to its original watermarked noise, enabling straightforward\nwatermark extraction. Additionally, template bits allow precise detection for\npotential temporal and spatial modification. Extensive experiments across\nvarious video models (both T2V and I2V models) demonstrate that our method\neffectively extracts watermarks and detects tamper without compromising video\nquality. Furthermore, we show that this approach is applicable to image\ngeneration models, enabling tamper detection in generated images as well.

What\ncharacterizes stochastic models of non-equilibrium processes is the breaking of\nthe fluctuation-dissipation relations as well as the existence of non-static\nstable states, or phases. A prototypical example is a dynamical phase\ncharacterized by a limit cycle - the order parameter of finite magnitude\nrotating or oscillating at a fixed frequency. Consequently, birhythmicity,\nwhere two stable limit cycles coexist, is a natural extension of the simpler\nsingle limit cycle phase. Both the abundance of real systems exhibiting such\nstates as well as their relevance for building our understanding of\nnon-equilibrium phases and phase transitions are strong motivations to build\nand study models of such behavior. Field theoretic tools can be used to provide\ninsights into either phase and the transition between them. In this work we\nexplore a simple linear model of the single limit cycle phase with\nphase-amplitude coupling. We demonstrate how such non-equilibrium coupling\naffects the fluctuation spectrum of the theory. We then extend this model to\ninclude a continuous transition to a two-cycle phase.

Previously, for the extensively studied Couette flow or the\nTaylor-Couette flow in bounded annular domains, methods based on resolvent\nestimates could derive exponential decay asymptotic for the solutions of the\nlinearized system. However, unlike the Couette flow or the Taylor-Couette flow\nin bounded annular domains, the Taylor-Couette flow in exterior regions\nexhibits degeneration of derivatives of any order at infinity. In this paper,\nwe present in Theorem 1.1 that the linearized system of the 2D Taylor-Couette\nflow in the exterior region exhibits space-time coupled polynomial decay\nasymptotics. We also prove that the solution to this system, when it contains\ninhomogeneous terms, cannot be expected to exhibit space-time coupled\nexponential decay, as detailed in Theorem 1.2. The result of Theorem 1.2\nindicates that, even if we can obtain sharp resolvent estimates in different\nweighted spaces, the Gearhart-Pr\\\"uss type lemma no longer applies. This\nsuggests that resolvent estimates may not be very effective for handling\ndegenerate shear flows. Furthermore, Theorem 1.2 also implies that, for the\ntransition threshold problem of the 2D Taylor-Couette flow in exterior regions,\nwe can at most expect the solution to exhibit long-time behavior with\nspace-time coupled polynomial decay. Finally, we present a generalization of\nTheorem 1.2, as detailed in Theorem 1.3.",

To address this\nissue, we propose VarDrop, a simple yet efficient strategy that reduces the\ntoken usage by omitting redundant variate tokens during training. VarDrop\nadaptively excludes redundant tokens within a given batch, thereby reducing the\nnumber of tokens used for dot-product attention while preserving essential\ninformation. Specifically, we introduce k-dominant frequency hashing (k-DFH),\nwhich utilizes the ranked dominant frequencies in the frequency domain as a\nhash value to efficiently group variate tokens exhibiting similar periodic\nbehaviors. Then, only representative tokens in each group are sampled through\nstratified sampling. By performing sparse attention with these selected tokens,\nthe computational cost of scaled dot-product attention is significantly\nalleviated.

It is also often overlooked that spuriousness is a subjective\nnotion.

These models were\nimplemented to evaluate the best performing variant that achieves superior\ncomputational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy in malaria blood cell\nclassification. The models were trained and evaluated using the NIH Malaria\ndataset. We assessed each model's performance based on metrics including\naccuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The\nresults show that the SqueezeNet1.1 model achieves the highest performance\nacross all metrics, with a classification accuracy of 97.12%. Variant 3 (four\nfire modules) offers a competitive alternative, delivering almost identical\nresults (accuracy 96.55%) with a 6x reduction in computational overhead\ncompared to SqueezeNet1.1. Variant 2 and Variant 1 perform slightly lower than\nVariant 3, with Variant 2 (two fire modules) reducing computational overhead by\n28x, and Variant 1 (one fire module) achieving a 54x reduction in trainable\nparameters compared to SqueezeNet1.1. These findings demonstrate that our\nSqueezeNet1.1 architecture variants provide a flexible approach to malaria\ndetection, enabling the selection of a variant that balances resource\nconstraints and performance.",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal brain MRI provides essential complementary information for\nclinical diagnosis. However, acquiring all modalities in practice is often\nconstrained by time and cost. To address this, various methods have been\nproposed to generate missing modalities from available ones. Traditional\napproaches can be broadly categorized into two main types: paired and unpaired\nmethods. While paired methods for synthesizing missing modalities achieve high\naccuracy, obtaining large-scale paired datasets is typically impractical. In\ncontrast, unpaired methods, though scalable, often fail to preserve critical\nanatomical features, such as lesions. In this paper, we propose Fully Guided\nSchr\\\"odinger Bridge (FGSB), a novel framework designed to overcome these\nlimitations by enabling high-fidelity generation with extremely limited paired\ndata. Furthermore, when provided with lesion-specific information such as\nexpert annotations, segmentation tools, or simple intensity thresholds for\ncritical regions, FGSB can generate missing modalities while preserving these\nsignificant lesion with reduced data requirements. Our model comprises two\nstages: 1) Generation Phase: Iteratively refines synthetic images using paired\ntarget image and Gaussian noise. Training Phase: Learns optimal transformation\npathways from source to target modality by mapping all intermediate states,\nensuring consistent and high-fidelity synthesis. Experimental results across\nmultiple datasets demonstrate that FGSB achieved performance comparable to\nlarge-data-trained models, while using only two subjects. Incorporating\nlesion-specific priors further improves the preservation of clinical features.",

Obtaining a radar signal to match\na specified AF magnitude is a bi-variate variant of the well-known phase\nretrieval problem. Prior approaches to this problem were either limited to a\nfew classes of waveforms or lacked a computable procedure to estimate the\nsignal. Our recent work provided a framework for solving this problem for both\nband- and time-limited signals using non-convex optimization. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel approach WaveMax that formulates waveform recovery as a\nconvex optimization problem by relying on the fractional Fourier transform\n(FrFT)-based AF. We exploit the fact that AF of the FrFT of the original signal\nis equivalent to a rotation of the original AF. In particular, we reconstruct\nthe radar signal by solving a low-rank minimization problem, which approximates\nthe waveform using the leading eigenvector of a matrix derived from the AF. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that unique waveform reconstruction is achievable\nwith a sample size no more than three times the signal frequencies or time\nsamples.

We study the role of\nsignaling mechanisms in reducing the number of interviews in centralized random\nmatching markets with post-interview shocks. For the market to clear we focus\non interim stability, which extends the notion of stability to ensure that\nagents do not regret not interviewing with each other. A matching is almost\ninterim stable if it is interim stable after removing a vanishingly small\nfraction of agents.\n  We first study signaling mechanisms in random matching markets when agents on\nthe short side, long side, or both sides signal their top~$d$ preferred\npartners. Interviews graphs are formed by including all pairs where at least\none party has signaled the other. We show that when $d = \\omega(1)$, short-side\nsignaling leads to almost interim stable matchings. Long-side signaling is only\neffective when the market is almost balanced. Conversely, when the interview\nshocks are negligible and $d = o(\\log n)$, both-side signaling fails to achieve\nalmost interim stability. For larger $d \\ge \\Omega(\\log^2 n)$, short-side\nsignaling achieves perfect interim stability, while long-side signaling fails\nin imbalanced markets. We build on our findings to propose a signaling\nmechanism for multi-tiered random markets. Our analysis identifies conditions\nunder which signaling mechanisms are incentive compatible.

Traditional approaches associate the emergence\nof classicality with the decoherence process induced by large reservoirs on the\nsystem's state. In this work, we present an effective mechanism by which\nclassicality emerges through the establishment of elements of reality. This\ninvolves the process of successive monitoring of noncommuting observables. To\nassess physical reality, we employ the realism criterion introduced by Bilobran\nand Angelo [EPL, 112 (2015) 40005], as well as their quantifier for the\nviolations of this criterion. With these tools, we formally demonstrate, for\ngeneric systems, that a quasi-classical regime can always be reached with a\nsufficiently large number of incompatible measurements. Thus, instead of\ndiagnosing the emergence of the classical regime in terms of the resulting\nalgebraic characteristics for the density operator under the action of large\nreservoirs, our results reveal that classicality can emerge, at the level of\nphysical elements of reality, from the coupling of the system with environments\nof a few degrees of freedom.",

SelfPrompt addresses these challenges by introducing a\ncluster-guided pseudo-labelling method that improves pseudo-label accuracy, and\na confidence-aware semi-supervised learning module that maximizes the\nutilization of unlabelled data by combining supervised learning and\nweakly-supervised learning.

The previous result in the literature, which has been called\noptimal, corresponds to $C^{1,1}$ regularity with respect to the Kolmogorov\ndistance. This is the expected regularity for solutions to obstacle problems.\nOur unexpected improvement of regularity in the $x$ variable is obtained using\nBernstein's technique and an approach drawing on ideas from Evans-Krylov\ntheory.\n  We then use this improvement in regularity of the solution to prove the first\nknown free boundary regularity result.
