    "abstract": "Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material\nvariability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of\nclassical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a\nlanguage-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in\nmanufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized\ninto three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using\na conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language\nmodeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process\nand applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack\ndatasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge\ncontinuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the\nrefinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including\nGoogle's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided\nworkflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1\nconsistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and\nperceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided\ngenerative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the\nlimitations of classical pipelines.",

    "abstract": "The next generation of large telescopes for direct imaging of exoplanets will\nrequire segmented primary mirrors. Over both long and short timescales, these\ntelescopes experience segment misalignments which degrade the final science\nimage. Adaptive optics (AO) systems can be used to correct these aberrations in\nreal time. AO systems require wavefront sensors (WFSs) that measure the phase\nof the incoming light in order to reconstruct optical aberrations. However,\nmost WFSs used for sensing atmospheric turbulence cannot correctly detect\naberrations induced by misalignments in segmented telescopes, as they show poor\nsensitivity to phase discontinuities. We investigate the potential of photonic\nlanterns (PLs), which are waveguides that allow for the low-loss transmission\nfrom multi-mode to multiple single-mode optical signals, for sensing segment\nmisalignments at the focal plane. We assess the ability of PLs to measure\npiston offsets in segmented mirrors through both simulations and laboratory\nexperiments. We simulate the photonic lantern and demonstrate linear\nreconstruction on segment pistons. Further, we train a neural network to\nreconstruct aberrations outside of the linear regime. We experimentally\nvalidate reconstruction of segment piston offsets on the Miniature Infrared\nSEAL (muirSEAL) testbed, which includes a segmented deformable mirror, a PSF\nimaging branch, and a PL.

We formulate the overall problem by coupling a semi-discrete\noptimal transport (SDOT) problem, capturing the space partitioning component,\nwith a minimum-cost flow problem on a discrete network. This formulation\njointly optimizes the assignment of a continuous demand distribution to certain\nendpoint network nodes and the routing of flows over the network to serve the\ndemand, under capacity constraints. As for SDOT problems, we show that the\nformulation of our problem admits a tight relaxation taking the form of an\ninfinite-dimensional linear program, derive a finite-dimensional dual problem,\nand show that strong duality holds. We leverage these results to design a\ndistributed dual gradient ascent algorithm to solve the problem, where nodes in\nthe graph perform computations based solely on locally available information.\nSimulation results illustrate the algorithm performance and its applicability\nto an electric power distribution network reconfiguration problem.

Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate\nthat employing a verifier significantly improves expected action quality.\nEmpirical evaluations and analysis across multiple simulated and real-world\nenvironments including articulated objects, multi-modal doors, and uneven\nobject pick-up confirm the effectiveness of our method and improvements over\nbaselines.

    "abstract": "We propose a general two-period model where electrical vehicles (EVs) can\nreserve charging sessions in the day-ahead market and swap them in the\nreal-time market. Under the model, we explore several candidate mechanisms for\nrunning the two markets, compared using several normative properties such as\nincentive compatibility, efficiency, reservation awareness, and budget balance.\nSpecifically, reservation awareness is the only property coupling the two\nmarkets and dictates that an EV will not get a lower utility by joining the\nreal-time market. Focusing on the real-time market, we show that two variants\nof the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism do not satisfy all the\nproposed properties; specifically, one is not reservation-aware, while the\nother is not budget-balanced. Moreover, we show that no mechanism satisfies\nsome combinations of the properties. Then, we propose to use a posted-price\nmechanism to resolve the issue, which turns out to be the dynamic pricing\nmechanism adopted in many real-world systems. The proposed mechanism has no\nefficiency guarantee but satisfies all the other properties. To improve\nefficiency, we propose to use a VCG auction in the day-ahead market that guides\nthe reserve prices in the real-time market. When EVs' valuations in the two\nmarkets are highly correlated, the proposed approach results in highly\nefficient outcomes.",

Coupled with geometry-aware regularization\nguidance, a spectral modulation strategy in the Fourier domain and a refinement\nstep for 3D enhancement, our method outperforms previous 3D editing methods\nenabling high-fidelity, precise, and robust edits across a wide range of shapes\nand semantic manipulations.",

    "abstract": "Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in\nscience. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors\nshould exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world\nseismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature\nor simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive\nfrequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent\nfrequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and\nnormal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic\nrecords from seven major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku\nand 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory\nsignatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging\nhours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic\nsettings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental\nstrike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate\nthat hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a\npathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake\nforecasting.",

The core of this methodology is the construction of directed\nattack graphs, which systematically map all potential paths an adversary could\ntake from an entry point to a critical asset. By visualizing these attack paths\nalongside defense mechanisms, the framework provides a clear, comprehensive\noverview of the system's vulnerabilities and security gaps.

To address such challenges, we propose\nthe Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM), a hybrid\nquantum-optimized approach that integrates state space dynamics with a\nvariational quantum gate. Instead of relying on expensive attention mechanisms,\nQ-SSM employs a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz) whose\nexpectation values regulate memory updates adaptively. This quantum gating\nmechanism improves convergence stability, enhances the modeling of long-term\ndependencies, and provides a lightweight alternative to attention.

    "abstract": "We develop a probabilistic method for assessing the tail behavior and\ngeometric stability of one-dimensional n i.i.d. samples by tracking how their\nspan contracts when the most extreme points are trimmed. Central to our\napproach is the diameter-shrinkage ratio, that quantifies the relative\nreduction in data range as extreme points are successively removed. We derive\nanalytical expressions, including finite-sample corrections, for the expected\nshrinkage under both the uniform and Gaussian hypotheses, and establish that\nthese curves remain distinct even for moderate number of removal. We construct\nan elementary decision rule that assigns a sample to whichever theoretical\nshrinkage profile it most closely follows. This test achieves higher\nclassification accuracy than the classical likelihood-ratio test in\nsmall-sample or noisy regimes, while preserving asymptotic consistency for\nlarge n. We further integrate our criterion into a clustering pipeline (e.g.\nDBSCAN), demonstrating its ability to validate one-dimensional clusters without\nany density estimation or parameter tuning. This work thus provides both\ntheoretical insight and practical tools for robust distributional inference and\ncluster stability analysis.",

    "abstract": "Dynamical tides of neutron stars in the late stages of binary inspirals\nprovide a viable probe into dense matter through gravitational waves, and\npotentially trigger electromagnetic precursors. We model the tidal response as\na set of driven harmonic oscillators, where the natural frequencies are given\nby the quasinormal modes of a nonrotating neutron star. These modes are\ncalculated in general relativity by applying linear perturbation theory to\nstellar models that include a solid crust and compositional stratification. For\nthe mode spectrum, we find that the canonical interface mode associated with\nthe crust-core boundary vanishes in stratified neutron stars and is replaced by\ncompositional gravity modes with mixed gravity-interfacial character, driven\nprimarily by strong buoyancy in the outer core. We also find that fluid modes\nsuch as the core gravity mode and the fundamental mode can penetrate the crust,\nand we establish a criterion for such penetration. Regarding the tidal\ninteraction, we find that transfer of binding energy to oscillations is\ndominated by the fundamental mode despite its frequency being too high to\nresonate with the tidal forcing. In general, we find that lower-frequency modes\ninduce gravitational-wave phase shifts smaller than $\\sim 10^{-3},\\rm rad$ for\nthe equation of state we consider. We discover that nonresonant fundamental and\ncrustal shear modes can trigger crust breaking already near the first\ngravity-mode resonance, while gravity-mode resonance concentrates strain at the\nbase of the crust and may marginally crack it. These results suggest that both\nresonant and nonresonant excitations can overstress the crust and may channel\nenergy into the magnetosphere prior to merger, potentially powering\nelectromagnetic precursors. Our work represents an important step toward\nrealistic modeling of dynamical tides of neutron stars in multimessenger\nobservations.",

Very long\ndistance between the external occulter and the telescope (around 144 m)\nrepresents an increase of two orders of magnitude compared to classical\nexternally occulted solar coronagraphs. This allows us to observe the inner\ncorona in eclipse-like conditions, i.e. close to the solar limb (down to 1.099\nRs) and with very low straylight.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after\npre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and\nengineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is\nbrittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks\ncatastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS):\ncurated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters\nupdated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection\nEngine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and\nfailures, and proposes typed deltas $\\Delta K=(\\Delta S,\\Delta U,\\Delta T)$\nover instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled,\nevaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first\nfailure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a\nthreshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills\nmatured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space\nimprovements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the\nlow-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves\ngovernance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased\nthroughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen\nbaseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept \"L0 Support\", it achieved\n4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous\ninstruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the\ninstruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic\ndomains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool\ncreation, and low-latency deployment.",

This\npoint-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities,\nenabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach.\nThe Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning\nagents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task.\nTo showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game\nmode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive\nfeedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom\ndocuments to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported.

This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which\nmodels, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated\nas signs.

We develop and implement\na systematic, replicable framework to quantify coverage bias in aggregated\nmobile phone application data without requiring individual-level demographic\nattributes.

Coverage bias is strongly associated\nwith demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic features, often in complex\nnonlinear ways.

    "abstract": "Large Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) provides a general framework for\ncomputing the multi-dimensional partonic structure of the proton from first\nprinciples using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this effective field\ntheory approach, LaMET predicts parton distributions through a power expansion\nand perturbative matching of a class of Euclidean observables --\nquasi-distributions -- evaluated at large proton momenta. Recent advances in\nlattice renormalization, such as the hybrid scheme with leading-renormalon\nresummation, together with improved matching kernel that incorporates\nhigher-loop corrections and resummations, have enhanced both the perturbative\nand power accuracy of LaMET, enabling a reliable quantification of theoretical\nuncertainties. Moreover, the Coulomb-gauge correlator approach further\nsimplifies lattice analyses and improves the precision of\ntransverse-momentum-dependent structures, particularly in the non-perturbative\nregion. State-of-the-art LaMET calculations have already yielded certain parton\nobservables with significant phenomenological impact. In addition, the recently\nproposed kinematically enhanced lattice interpolation operators promise access\nto unprecedented proton momenta with greatly improved signal-to-noise ratios,\nwhich will extend the range of LaMET prediction and further suppress the power\ncorrections. The remaining challenges, such as controlling excited-state\ncontamination in lattice matrix elements and extracting gluonic distributions,\nare expected to benefit from emerging lattice techniques for ground-state\nisolation and noise reduction. Thus, lattice QCD studies of parton physics have\nentered an exciting stage of precision control and systematic improvement,\nwhich will have a broader impact for nuclear and particle experiments.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The pathway to clinical medical physics involves 3 distinct stages\nof accredited positions, including (i) graduate education, (ii) residency\ntraining & (iii) employment. While CAMPEP accredits programs & people, the type\nof positions and numbers available are each more influenced by local\ninstitutional free market forces driving their choices. Methods: Understanding\nthe overall status and trajectories of the full range of residency positions\nwas the rationale for this survey, using publicly available data reported 2017\nto 2023 timeframe. Results: Current data shows 108 therapy residency programs\nwith 163 positions, and 38 diagnostic imaging residency programs with 39\npositions. The total numbers show growth in positions by +6.5/year in therapy,\nand +2.1/year in imaging. There are 18 therapy and 10 imaging residencies\nlonger than 2 years, all at university hospitals, and nearly all requiring a\nPhD. The number of programs that accept graduates with either MS or PhD, versus\nPhD only, has grown, from 69 to 105 from 2017 to 2023. There was a trend in\nlarge health networks increasing their residency numbers from 9 to 23 in this\ntimeframe. The total 7-year growth trend was compared to numbers of graduating\nstudents, showing reasonable agreement between positions with expected\ninter-year variation. Conclusions: There has been growth in numbers of\naccredited residencies, with accompanying shifts in program types & student\neducation expected. Most are 2-years, while there is smaller growth in longer\nprograms with research added in, primarily at university hospitals. Major\ngrowth has occurred in residencies accepting both MS and PhD graduates, while\nthose accepting only PhD graduates tends to be more imaging focused and at\nuniversity centers. Overall, the number positions has been keeping pace with\nthe known growth in graduates from accredited medical physics graduate\nprograms.",

    "abstract": "Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each\ncandidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving\nor summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a\nmodel's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of\ndocuments. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that\nchallenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and\nsurface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less\nthan 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as\ncandidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning,\nnot retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we\npresent DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable\nparameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using\nDiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining\nacross ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance\ngap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however,\nsubstantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We\nalso find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as\ndistinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs'\nabilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.",

Standards and guidance have not kept pace with the\ntechnology; evaluation datasets are nascent; and statistical approaches to\nuncertainty analysis are not yet practical to apply to scaled systems. We\npresent a set of criteria to validate AI-assisted systems that calculate\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for products and materials. We implement a\nthree-step approach: (1) Identification of needs and constraints, (2) Draft\ncriteria development and (3) Refinements through pilots. The process identifies\nthree use cases of AI applications: Case 1 focuses on AI-assisted mapping to\nexisting datasets for corporate GHG accounting and product hotspotting,\nautomating repetitive manual tasks while maintaining mapping quality. Case 2\naddresses AI systems that generate complete product models for corporate\ndecision-making, which require comprehensive validation of both component tasks\nand end-to-end performance. We discuss the outlook for Case 3 applications,\nsystems that generate standards-compliant models. We find that credible AI\nsystems can be built and that they should be validated using system-level\nevaluations rather than line-item review, with metrics such as benchmark\nperformance, indications of data quality and uncertainty, and transparent\ndocumentation. This approach may be used as a foundation for practitioners,\nauditors, and standards bodies to evaluate AI-assisted environmental assessment\ntools.

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has transformed cancer treatment, yet its delayed therapeutic\neffects often lead to non-proportional hazards, rendering many conventional\nphase II designs underpowered and prone to type I error inflation. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel Bayesian Optimal Phase II design (DTE-BOP2) that\nexplicitly models the uncertainty in the separation timing of treatment effect.\nThe treatment separation timepoint (denoted by S) is endowed with a\ntruncated-Gamma prior, whose parameters can be elicited from experts or\ninferred from historical data, with default settings available when prior\nknowledge is scarce. Built upon the BOP2 framework (Zhou et al. 2017, 2020),\nour design retains operational simplicity while incorporating type I error\ncontrol and maintaining the power. Extensive simulations demonstrate that\nDTE-BOP2 uniformly controls type I error at the nominal level across a wide\nrange of treatment effect separation timepoint S. We further observe that the\npower decreases monotonically as S increases. Importantly, we find that the\npower is primarily driven by the relative magnitude of treatment benefit before\nand after the separation time, i.e., the ratio of medians, rather than their\nabsolute values. Compared to the original BOP2, the piecewise weighted\nlog-rank, and the conventional log-rank tests, DTE-BOP2 achieves higher power\nwith smaller sample sizes while preserving type I error robustness across\nplausible delay scenarios. An open-source R package, DTEBOP2 (CRAN), with\ndetailed vignettes, enables investigators to implement the design and analyse\nphase-II trials exhibiting delayed treatment effects.",

A prominent component of mixed layer dynamics is the appearance of\na spanwise ordered array of streamwise oriented roll/streak structures (RSS),\nreferred to as Langmuir circulations, that form in the presence of surface wind\nstress. The coherence and long-range order of the Langmuir circulations are\nstrongly suggestive of an underlying modal instability, and surface wind stress\nproduces the necessary Eulerian shear to provide the required kinetic energy.\nUnfortunately, there is no instability with RSS form supported solely by\nEulerian surface stress-driven shear. However, in the presence of velocity\nfluctuations in the water column, either in the form of a surface gravity wave\nvelocity field and/or a background field of turbulence, there are two\ninstabilities of the required form. These are the Craik-Leibovich CL2\ninstability arising from interaction of the Eulerian shear vorticity with the\nStokes drift of a surface gravity wave velocity field and the Reynolds stress\n(RS) torque instability arising from the organization of turbulent Reynolds\nstresses by a perturbing RSS. The CL2 instability is familiar as an explanation\nfor the RSS of the Langmuir circulation, while the RS torque instability is\nfamiliar as an explanation for the RSS in wall-bounded shear flows.

Groups are especially interesting\nbecause they represent the link between galactic haloes and massive clusters.\nHowever, the low surface brightness of this diffuse light makes it extremely\nchallenging to detect individually.

In this work, we present a special-purpose\npipeline to reprocess individual $r-$band Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) exposures\nto optimise the IGL detection. Using an initial sample of 2385 groups with at\nleast five spectroscopically-confirmed member galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass\nAssembly (GAMA) survey and reprocessed deep images from the KiDS, we present\nthe first robust measurement of IGL from a large group sample (~ 750) down to\n31-32 mag/arcsec$^2$ (varying in different stacked bins). We also compare our\nstacked IGL measurements to predictions from matched mock observations from the\nHydrangea cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Systematics in the imaging\ndata can affect IGL measurements, even with our special-purpose pipeline.\nHowever, with a large sample and optimised analysis, we can place\nwell-constrained upper and lower limits on the IGL fraction (3 - 21 per cent)\nfor our group ensemble across $0.09\\leq z\\leq 0.27$ and $12.5\\leq\n\\log_{10}[M_{200}/\\mathrm{M}_\\odot] \\leq 14.0$.

Two key aspects of\nthe algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and\naccuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous\nlines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms\nwith optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for\npower-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$\nextend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that\nworsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded\nerror but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$\nalgorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our\ndevelopment of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes\nbeyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the\n$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an\nimage of shape $w \\times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal\ncomputational complexity $\\mathcal{O}(wh \\ln^3 w)$, while keeping the\napproximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and\ncontrollable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental\nanalyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.",

Within dynamical mean-field\ntheory (DMFT), the paradigmatic single-band Hubbard model (SBHM) displays such\ncriticality only above a finite-temperature endpoint. In contrast, the modified\nperiodic Anderson model (MPAM) is a rare example known to host a surface of\ngenuinely continuous Mott quantum critical points (QCPs) at zero temperature.\nUsing DMFT with the numerical renormalization group as an impurity solver, we\ninvestigate the finite-temperature, real-frequency properties of the MPAM. Our\ncentral finding is the emergence of quantum critical scaling in the electrical\nresistivity, with critical exponents $z_{\\text{met}} = 0.76$ and\n$z_{\\text{ins}} = 0.66$ on the metallic and insulating sides, respectively.\nThese values fall within the range reported for the SBHM, suggesting that both\ntransitions are governed by a common universality class.

Finally,\nwe identify novel transport signatures in the optical conductivity, where the\ndistinct evolution of two isosbestic points serves as a unique fingerprint of\nthe QCP.

    "abstract": "The accurate segmentation of lesions in whole-body PET/CT imaging is\nes-sential for tumor characterization, treatment planning, and response\nassess-ment, yet current manual workflows are labor-intensive and prone to\ninter-observer variability. Automated deep learning methods have shown promise\nbut often remain limited by modality specificity, isolated time points, or\nin-sufficient integration of expert knowledge. To address these challenges, we\npresent a two-stage lesion segmentation framework developed for the fourth\nAutoPET Challenge. In the first stage, a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is em-ployed\nfor self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled PET/CT and longitudinal CT scans,\nenabling the extraction of robust modality-specific representations without\nmanual annotations. In the second stage, the pretrained encoder is fine-tuned\nwith a bidirectional XLSTM architecture augmented with ResNet blocks and a\nconvolutional decoder. By jointly leveraging anatomical (CT) and functional\n(PET) information as complementary input channels, the model achieves improved\ntemporal and spatial feature integration. Evalua-tion on the AutoPET Task 1\ndataset demonstrates that self-supervised pre-training significantly enhances\nsegmentation accuracy, achieving a Dice score of 0.582 compared to 0.543\nwithout pretraining. These findings high-light the potential of combining\nself-supervised learning with multimodal fu-sion for robust and generalizable\nPET/CT lesion segmentation.

Here we utilize network science to investigate the\nentanglement networks of C-shaped granular particles under vibration through\nexperiments and simulations. By analyzing key network properties, we\ndemonstrate that these networks undergo a percolation transition as the number\nof links increases logarithmically over time; the entangled particles form a\ngiant cluster when the number of links exceeds a critical threshold. We propose\na continuum percolation model of rings that effectively describes the observed\ntransition.

While\nearly gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared\nto derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical\ndue to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can\napproximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver\nefficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts,\nwhich can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples\ntrajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled\nusing a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a\nlearned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables\nefficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator\ngradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation\nrollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and\nspeed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality\nof standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other\nfirst-order MBRL methods.

This\npaper presents the Javalambre Variability Survey (J-VAR) which leverages the\nnarrow band filters available at the Javalambre Auxiliary Survey Telescope\n(JAST80) at the Observatorio Astrof\\'isico de Javalambre (OAJ).\n  Methods. The JAST80 equipped with T80Cam, providing a field of view of\n2\\,square degrees and a pixel scale of 0.55\\,arcsec/pixel has been designed for\nwide-field studies. The main characteristic is the availability of a variety of\nnarrow band filters strategically located on stellar spectral features (the\n$J0395$ in correspondence of the Ca H+K doublet, the $J0515$ of the Mg $b$\ntriplet, the $J0660$ of the H$\\alpha$ line, and the $J0861$ of the Ca~triplet).\nThis project combines, for the first time, the wide-field with a variety of\nnarrow band filters for a unique variability survey, observing each field\n11~times with a standardised observing sequence. The median limiting magnitude\nfor individual exposures are 19.1 mag in $J0395$ and $J0515$, $19.6$ mag in\n$J0660$ and $J0861$, $19.8$ mag in $i$, and $20.2$ in $g$ and $r$. The typical\nFWHM of the $r$-band images is $1.5$ arcsec.\n  Results. This article introduces the first data release of J-VAR including\nmore than 6000 individual asteroids, 10\\,detected optical transients\n(4\\,discovered supernovae), and 1.3 million light curves of point-sources. On\naverage, J-VAR delivers an unprecedented $\\sim$5000 light curves per square\ndegree of 11\\,epochs in 7\\,bands, opening research opportunities for\ntheoretical studies and new discoveries alike.",

However, both weather\nand climate modeling communities share a need for motivating major observing\nsystem investments.

It requires accounting for an immense number of energy levels\nand lines across various excitation and ionization states. Whether in local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) or non-LTE plasmas, statistical methods provide\nsignificant assistance. Many computational codes are based on the Detailed\nConfiguration Accounting approximation, which involves averaged rates between\nconfigurations. In that approach, only the mean energies of the configurations\nare considered, and the effects of the energy distributions of the levels\nwithin the initial and final configurations are typically neglected. A long\ntime ago, Klapisch proposed a method to correct the rates. The corresponding\nformalism includes the energy shift and variance of the Unresolved Transition\nArray, as well as the average energies of the configurations. We extend this\nformalism and investigate its impact on opacity calculations in two specific\ncases: first, the iron experiment conducted at Sandia National Laboratories\nunder conditions similar to those at the base of the Sun's convective zone,\ndominated by L-shell 2p-$n$d transitions, and second, laser experiments--still\nfor iron--at much lower temperature.

    "abstract": "The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often\nhindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled\ndatasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like\nActive Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying\ninformative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight\nof human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an\nemployed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)\napproaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine\nlearning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),\neffective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.\nThis thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and\ninvestigating \"VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection\".\nVILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,\ntogether with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to\nexplore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse\nsample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An\nempirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,\nthrough its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of\ndistinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset\ncharacteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different\nvisually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive\nOD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL\nbaseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into\nmaking the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and\npotentially more effective.",

A central challenge in using PDEs for real-world\napplications is to accurately infer the parameters, particularly when the\nparameters exhibit non-linear and spatiotemporal variations. Existing parameter\nestimation methods, such as sparse identification and physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs), struggle in such cases, especially with nonlinear dynamics,\nmultiphysics interactions, or limited observations of the system response. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce Neptune, a general-purpose method\ncapable of inferring parameter fields from sparse measurements of system\nresponses. Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to\ncontinuously represent each parameter field in physical space or in state\nvariables. Across various physical and biomedical problems, where direct\nparameter measurements are prohibitively expensive or unattainable, Neptune\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods, achieving robust parameter\nestimation from as few as 50 observations, reducing parameter estimation errors\nby two orders of magnitude and dynamic response prediction errors by a factor\nof ten compared to PINNs. Furthermore, Neptune exhibits superior extrapolation\ncapabilities, enabling accurate predictions in regimes beyond training data\nwhere PINN fail. By facilitating reliable and data-efficient parameter\ninference, Neptune promises broad transformative impacts in engineering,\nhealthcare, and beyond.",

    "abstract": "A conventional LLM Unlearning setting consists of two subsets -\"forget\" and\n\"retain\", with the objectives of removing the undesired knowledge from the\nforget set while preserving the remaining knowledge from the retain. In\nprivacy-focused unlearning research, a retain set is often further divided into\nneighbor sets, containing either directly or indirectly connected to the forget\ntargets; and augmented by a general-knowledge set. A common practice in\nexisting benchmarks is to employ only a single neighbor set, with general\nknowledge which fails to reflect the real-world data complexities and\nrelationships. LLM Unlearning typically involves 1:1 sampling or cyclic\niteration sampling. However, the efficacy and stability of these de facto\nstandards have not been critically examined. In this study, we systematically\nevaluate these common practices. Our findings reveal that relying on a single\nneighbor set is suboptimal and that a standard sampling approach can obscure\nperformance trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we propose and validate an\ninitial set of best practices: (1) Incorporation of diverse neighbor sets to\nbalance forget efficacy and model utility, (2) Standard 1:1 sampling methods\nare inefficient and yield poor results, (3) Our proposed Modular Entity-Level\nUnlearning (MELU) strategy as an alternative to cyclic sampling.

To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the\nTConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer.\nTConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a\ntruly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this\nmechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time\ncomputations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single\nlinear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step.\nTheoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer\nexhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed,\nmemory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks.

    "abstract": "What is the role of algebra in classical mathematics education? How does it\nrelate to the four quadrivial arts? These questions have troubled the\nmathematical community since the introduction of algebra into the Renaissance\nacademy by men like Fran\\c{c}ois Vi\\`ete, Guillame Gosselin, and Ren\\'e\nDescartes. Their challenge is perhaps most starkly articulated at the\nconclusion of Vi\\`ete's Introduction to the Analytic Art, where he claims that\nhis algebra \"appropriates to itself by right the proud problem of problems,\nwhich is: [sic] TO LEAVE NO PROBLEM UNSOLVED\".\n  Some contemporary educators respond by eschewing these methods to avoid the\nexcessive formalization often accompanying algebra, and to give a central place\nto the geometrical tradition of Euclid's Elements. Others embrace the rise of\nalgebra in the curriculum, focusing on contemporary techniques and priorities.\n  This paper seeks to reconcile these perspectives by clarifying the way in\nwhich algebra participates in the quadrivial arts. Based on testimony from both\nthe origins of algebra and its contemporary practitioners, I argue that algebra\nis not so much an eighth liberal art as an arithmetical language of form; an\nactualized potential in arithmetic.

However, a\nvariety of biases can distort the results of the experiment and mislead\ndecision-making. An underexplored but critical bias is algorithm adaptation\neffect. This bias arises from the flywheel dynamics among production models,\nuser data, and training pipelines: new models are evaluated on user data whose\ndistributions are shaped by the incumbent system or tested only in a small\ntreatment group. As a result, the measured effect of a new product change in\nmodeling and user experience in this constrained experimental setting can\ndiverge substantially from its true impact in full deployment. In practice, the\nexperiment results often favor the production variant with large traffic while\nunderestimating the performance of the test variant with small traffic, which\nleads to missing opportunities to launch a true winning arm or underestimating\nthe impact. This paper aims to raise awareness of algorithm adaptation bias,\nsituate it within the broader landscape of RecSys evaluation biases, and\nmotivate discussion of solutions that span experiment design, measurement, and\nadjustment.

    "abstract": "In practice, there often exist unobserved variables, also termed hidden\nvariables, associated with both the response and covariates. Existing works in\nthe literature mostly focus on linear regression with hidden variables.\nHowever, when the regression model is non-linear, the presence of hidden\nvariables leads to new challenges in parameter identification, estimation, and\nstatistical inference. This paper studies multivariate response generalized\nlinear models (GLMs) with hidden variables. We propose a unified framework for\nparameter estimation and statistical inference called G-HIVE, short for\n'G'eneralized - 'HI'dden 'V'ariable adjusted 'E'stimation. Specifically, based\non factor model assumptions, we propose a modified quasi-likelihood approach to\nestimate an intermediate parameter, defined through a set of reweighted\nestimating equations. The key of our approach is to construct the proper\nweight, so that the first-order asymptotic bias of the estimator can be removed\nby orthogonal projection. Moreover, we propose an approximate inference\nframework for uncertainty quantification. Theoretically, we establish the\nfirst-order and second-order asymptotic bias and the convergence rate of our\nestimator. In addition, we characterize the accuracy of the Gaussian\napproximation of our estimator via the Berry-Esseen bound, which justifies the\nvalidity of the proposed approximate inference approach. Extensive simulations\nand real data analysis results show that G-HIVE is feasibly implementable and\ncan outperform the baseline method that ignores hidden variables.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, organizing group meetups for entertainment or other\nnecessities has gained significant importance, especially given the busy nature\nof daily schedules. People often combine multiple activities, such as dropping\nkids off at school, commuting to work, and grocery shopping, while seeking\nopportunities to meet others. To address this need, we propose a novel query\ntype, the Trip-based Group Nearest Neighbor (T-GNN) query, which identifies the\noptimal meetup Point of Interest (POI) that aligns with users' existing trips.\nAn individual trip consists of a sequence of locations, allowing users the\nflexibility to detour to the meetup POI at any location within the sequence,\nknown as a detour location. Given a set of trips for the users, the query\nidentifies the optimal meetup POI (e.g., restaurants or movie theaters) and\ndetour locations from each user's trip that minimize the total trip overhead\ndistance. The trip overhead distance refers to the additional distance a user\nmust travel to visit the meetup POI before returning to the next location in\ntheir trip. The sum of these overhead distances for all users constitutes the\ntotal trip overhead distance. The computation time for processing T-GNN queries\nincreases with the number of POIs. To address this, we introduce three\ntechniques to prune the POIs that cannot contribute to the optimal solution,\nand thus refine the search space. We also develop an efficient approach for\nprocessing T-GNN queries in real-time. Extensive experiments validate the\nperformance of the proposed algorithm.",

In this work,\nwe introduce a generative framework that combines a 3D convolutional\nautoencoder with a latent diffusion model (LDM) to learn electron density\ntrajectories from ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Our method\nencodes electron densities into a compact latent space and predicts their\nfuture states by sampling from the learned conditional distribution, enabling\nstable long-horizon rollouts without drift or collapse. To preserve statistical\nfidelity, we incorporate a scaled Jensen-Shannon divergence regularization that\naligns generated and reference density distributions. On AIMD trajectories of\nliquid lithium at 800 K, our model accurately captures both the spatial\ncorrelations and the log-normal-like statistical structure of the density.

This article examines the potential of muon imaging to\ninvestigate the contents of wrecked ships in the Baltic Sea and other marine\nenvironments. By analyzing the principles of muon tomography, its applications\nin underwater archaeology, and its advantages over traditional methods, we\nhighlight its potential to reveal hidden details within shipwrecks while\naddressing challenges posed by the marine environment. These wrecks pose\nsignificant environmental risks due to their hazardous contents, such as\nexplosives and crude oil products, making their detection and monitoring a\nmatter of environmental and safety concern. Accurate modeling and imaging of\nsuch wrecks are therefore crucial for assessing potential dangers and\nmitigating environmental impacts. In this work, we adopted an approach similar\nto that used in underground muon experiments. Muon propagation through 50\nmeters of seawater was simulated using GEANT4, with muons transported to a\ndepth of 35 meters and recorded in a virtual detector. The saved distributions\nof particle type, kinetic energy, interaction position, and angular directions\nwere then used as tabulated input to the PrimaryGeneratorAction module. This\napproach enabled the generation of a realistic underwater muon flux over a 20 m\nx 20 m surface at 35 meters depth, which was subsequently employed to simulate\ndifferent shipwreck filling scenarios. Assuming an exposure time of one week\nfor a wreck located at a depth of 50 meters, our simulations demonstrate that\nmuon imaging can resolve density contrasts sufficiently to distinguish between\nwater, oil, and high-density materials, underscoring its feasibility as a\npractical tool for underwater hazard assessment.",

As a by-product, we\nintroduce a new metric, the LHS degree, which quantifies the deviation of a\ngiven design from an LHS distribution. Our public implementation is distributed\nvia the Python package expandLHS.",

Its origin is actively debated.\nProposed scenarios include dynamical formation involving a sequence of mergers,\nPopulation III stars, accretion in an AGN disk and also more exotic\nexplanations including primordial black holes and cosmic strings, each facing\ndifferent challenges. Recent work showed that the incoming black holes of\nGW231123 can be formed out of massive rapidly rotating collapsing helium stars.\nHere, we address the question how such very massive rapidly rotating helium\nstars can be formed in very close binary systems. For this we explore\nchemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) involving progenitors with masses above\nthe pair-instability mass gap. We compute a grid of detailed massive binary\nmodels with the stellar evolution code MESA to follow the early evolution of\nbinary progenitors and show that: (i) very massive ($M_i > 140\\, M_\\odot$) CHE\nbinaries at low metallicity ($Z=10^{-5}$) naturally produce rapidly rotating\nprogenitors with high masses and high spins matching the properties of the\nblack holes in GW231123 and (ii) the maximum spin of the progenitors is bound\nby their critical rotation rate leading to a tight correlation between the\ndimensionless spin and mass, $a \\propto M^{-0.9}$, in models that have no\nhydrogen left. We conclude that the CHE channel appears to be a viable and\nnatural scenario to produce progenitors.

Rather than fitting directly to\nproperties such as the low-redshift stellar mass function (SMF) - which\nrequires evolving thousands of halos per likelihood evaluation - we construct a\nfast likelihood from the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR; mean and scatter)\nevaluated at a small set of target halo masses, reducing each evaluation to\nsimulating only tens of galaxies. We sample the posterior over Galacticus\nparameters with Markov Chain Monte Carlo and show that the resulting\ncalibration reproduces the low-redshift SMF. We then extend the method to\nadditional datasets, using a higher-redshift SHMR and the low-redshift stellar\nmass-size relation as examples, and assess performance for large scale\nstructure survey-relevant properties: stellar masses, sizes, and emission-line\nstrengths. The SMF matches data well at low redshift, but toward higher\nredshift the model yields too few massive galaxies and too many low-mass\ngalaxies. Size evolution with redshift is approximately correct, but the\nmass-size relation is too flat, producing massive galaxies that are too small.\nThe H$\\alpha$ luminosity function is well reproduced at z~2, but by z~0.4 the\nmodel overproduces highly star-forming, H$\\alpha$-bright systems. These\ndiscrepancies suggest the model lacks sufficient flexibility (e.g. in gas\ncooling/recycling or feedback) to reconcile all datasets simultaneously. Our\nstrategy complements emulator-based methods for calibrating semi-analytic\nmodels by enabling rapid, low-cost scans of model choices and parameterisations\n- a capability we envision leveraging to supply calibrated starting points for\nmore detailed follow-up inference.",

We accordingly examine\n$n-\\overline{n}$ oscillations within a unified framework that accounts for\ncharged fermion masses and generates viable neutrino masses via the seesaw\nmechanism. More specifically, we show that $n-\\overline{n}$ oscillations can\narise from two specific topologies within two distinct $SU(5)$ scenarios. One\ntopology requires a presence of two color-sextet scalars in the Type II seesaw\nframework, whereas the other involves a scalar sextet and a color-octet fermion\nin the Type III seesaw framework. While the former topology can be realized in\nthe $SO(10)$/Pati-Salam frameworks, the latter finds a natural embedding in\n$SU(5)$, which constitutes one of the key novelties of our work. Remarkably\nenough, the same dynamics responsible for fermion masses also induces baryon\nnumber violation, thus linking $n-\\overline{n}$ oscillations to the flavor\nstructure of the theory. We show that upcoming searches of such $\\Delta B = 2$\nprocesses can probe new colored states with masses up to $10^{11}$ GeV that is\nwell beyond the reach of colliders.

Our construction is based on\nconcatenating a small-distance 2D or 3D fermion-to-qubit code with a\nhigh-distance fermionic color code. Together, these features provide a robust\nand scalable pathway to quantum simulation of fermionic systems.",

    "abstract": "Observational and theoretical studies have long held that rapid gas\nconsumption in starbursts is responsible for the formation of quiescent\ngalaxies. However, studies of recently quenched ``post-starburst\" galaxies have\ndiscovered that a number of them are surprisingly luminous in CO, challenging\nthis assumption. We present deep ALMA CO(2-1) observations of 50 massive\n($\\log(M_\\star/M_\\odot)\\sim11.2$) post-starburst galaxies from the\nSQuIGG$\\vec{L}$E sample at $z\\sim0.7$. We detect a large fraction (27/50) of\nthe galaxies in CO(2-1). Furthermore, we find that the CO luminosity correlates\nwith the age of the recent starburst, suggesting a gas-removal timescale of\n$\\lesssim140$ Myr, an order of magnitude shorter than is implied by their rest\noptical star formation rates. We perform new spectral energy distribution fits\nincorporating mid- and far-IR photometry to test whether dust-obscured star\nformation can explain this trend. We find that while allowing for buried star\nformation can raise star formation rates by $\\sim0.5$ dex, for almost all\ngalaxies it is neither required to fit the observed IR SED, nor is it\nsufficient to explain the observed depletion trend. Even the combination of\nsignificant buried star formation and ULIRG-like $\\alpha_{CO}$ is not enough to\nexplain this decay in CO luminosity. Furthermore, there is no strong evidence\nto support either of those modifications to the depletion time. Therefore, it\nremains a distinct possibility that the age-CO luminosity trend should not be\ninterpreted as an evolutionary sequence, and that gas-rich SQuIGG$\\vec{L}$E\ngalaxies will soon rejuvenate.",

Principal\ncomponent analysis reveals that 81\\% of spectral variations can be described by\ntwo components, implying that variability within a single rotational phase is\ninduced by at least three distinct spectral regions. By comparing our data to a\ngrid of Sonora Diamondback atmospheric models, we confirm that the\ntime-averaged spectrum cannot be explained by a single model but require a\nlinear combination of at least three regions. Projecting these models onto the\nprincipal component plane shows that the overall variability is highly\ncorrelated with changes in temperature, cloud coverage, and possibly effective\nmetallicity. We also extract brightness maps from the lightcurve and establish\nNorth-South asymmetry in the atmosphere. A combined multidimensional analysis\nof spectro-photometric variability links the three spectral regions to three\natmospheric layers. Forsterite cloud and water abundance at each level form\nunique harmonics of atmospheric variability observed in different spectral\nbands. Atmospheric retrievals on the time-averaged spectrum are consistent with\nan optically thick iron cloud deck beneath a patchy forsterite cloud layer and\nwith the overall adiabatic curve. We also demonstrate two new analysis methods:\na regionally-resolved spectra retrieval that relies on multi-wavelength\nspherical harmonics maps, and a method to constrain brightness maps using\nDoppler information present in the spectra. Future observations of variable\nbrown dwarfs of higher spectral resolution or spanning multiple rotations\nshould help break mapping degeneracy.",

In this study, a survey was given to undergraduates in two\nintroductory physics classes (one class intended for majors, another for\nnon-majors) who had recently received their grade for the first exam of the\nsemester. The survey measured whether the exam had matched the students'\nexpectations of the exam, both in form and in content. From these responses,\nstudents were assigned an \"AM score,\" a numerical value in which higher numbers\nindicate a greater deviation between the actual exam and the students'\nexpectations. Students' exam scores were compared with their AM scores; both\nclasses displayed an inverse linear correlation between exam scores and AM\nscores. The class for majors displayed R-squared = 0.291 (n=14), corresponding\nto a p-value of 0.031. The class for non-majors displayed an R-squared = 0.457\n(n=30), corresponding to a p-value of 0.000035. The survey also inquired about\nseveral other phenomena, such as Impostor Syndrome and the growth-versus-fixed\nmindset paradigm; 20 graphs were plotted in total. The Bonferroni correction\ntherefore requires a p-value of 0.0025 for statistical significance. We reject\nthe null hypothesis concerning exam scores and feelings of AM for the physics\nclass for non-majors. In contrast, we fail to reject the null hypothesis\nconcerning exam scores and feelings of AM for the physics class for majors.

Specifically, given an input image, the model\nmust first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify\nthe participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),\nand finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).\nExisting methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we\nshow through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address\nthe inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories\nmay reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key\ncontributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb\nclassification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous\nsemantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of\nfully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to\nreformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning\n(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a\ncomprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully\ndesigned to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To\naddress the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb\nMultilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to\ncapture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision\nboundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach\nachieves more than 3\\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on\ntraditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.",

To address both privacy\nand fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent\nIntervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational\nautoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular\ndata. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a\ntask-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus\noffering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\\'enyi\ndifferential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness\nin the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for\ngroup-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent\nspace, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across\nprotected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure\nextending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment\nencourages statistical independence between latent representations and the\nprotected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides\nsignificant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse\ndownstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.",

Awareness of the issue\nand its potential solutions is lacking in the literature, which motivate this\nwork. Here, we formalize the issue of informative timing, problems associated\nwith ignoring it, and show how g-methods can be used to analyze sequential\ntreatments that are informatively timed. As we describe, in such settings, the\nwaiting times between successive treatment decisions may be properly viewed as\na time-varying confounders. Using synthetic examples, we illustrate how\ng-methods that do not adjust for these waiting times may be biased and how\nadjustment can be done in scenarios where patients may die or be censored in\nbetween treatments. We draw connections between adjustment and identification\nwith discrete-time versus continuous-time models. Finally, we provide\nimplementation guidance and examples using publicly available software. Our\nconcluding message is that 1) considering timing is important for valid\ninference and 2) correcting for informative timing can be done with g-methods\nthat adjust for waiting times between treatments as time-varying confounders.",

    "abstract": "Accurate real-time forecasting of cryogenic tank behavior is essential for\nthe safe and efficient operation of propulsion and storage systems in future\ndeep-space missions. While cryogenic fluid management (CFM) systems\nincreasingly require autonomous capabilities, conventional simulation methods\nremain hindered by high computational cost, model imperfections, and\nsensitivity to unanticipated boundary condition changes. To address these\nlimitations, this study proposes an Adaptive Real-Time Forecasting Framework\nfor Cryogenic Propellant Management in Space Systems, featuring a lightweight,\nnon-intrusive method named ARCTIC (Adaptive Real-time Cryogenic Tank Inference\nand Correction). ARCTIC integrates real-time sensor data with precomputed nodal\nsimulations through a data-driven correction layer that dynamically refines\nforecast accuracy without modifying the underlying model. Two updating\nmechanisms, auto-calibration and observation and correction, enable continuous\nadaptation to evolving system states and transient disturbances. The method is\nfirst assessed through synthetic scenarios representing self-pressurization,\nsloshing, and periodic operations, then validated using experimental data from\nNASA's Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed and K-Site facilities. Results\ndemonstrate that ARCTIC significantly improves forecast accuracy under model\nimperfections, data noise, and boundary fluctuations, offering a robust\nreal-time forecasting capability to support autonomous CFM operations. The\nframework's compatibility with existing simulation tools and its low\ncomputational overhead make it especially suited for onboard implementation in\nspace systems requiring predictive autonomy.",

    "abstract": "Modeling user interest based on lifelong user behavior sequences is crucial\nfor enhancing Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. However, long post-click\nbehavior sequences themselves pose severe performance issues: the sheer volume\nof data leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies in model training\nand inference. Traditional methods address this by introducing two-stage\napproaches, but this compromises model effectiveness due to incomplete\nutilization of the full sequence context. More importantly, integrating\nmultimodal embeddings into existing large recommendation models (LRM) presents\nsignificant challenges: These embeddings often exacerbate computational burdens\nand mismatch with LRM architectures. To address these issues and enhance the\nmodel's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest\nNetwork (DMGIN). Given the observation that user post-click behavior sequences\ncontain a large number of repeated items with varying behaviors and timestamps,\nDMGIN employs Multimodal LLMs(MLLM) for grouping to reorganize complete\nlifelong post-click behavior sequences more effectively, with almost no\nadditional computational overhead, as opposed to directly introducing\nmultimodal embeddings. To mitigate the potential information loss from\ngrouping, we have implemented two key strategies. First, we analyze behaviors\nwithin each group using both interest statistics and intra-group transformers\nto capture group traits. Second, apply inter-group transformers to temporally\nordered groups to capture the evolution of user group interests. Our extensive\nexperiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness\nand efficiency of DMGIN. The A/B test in our LBS advertising system shows that\nDMGIN improves CTR by 4.7% and Revenue per Mile by 2.3%.",

    "abstract": "Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach\nfor solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient\nguidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward\nlandscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios\ninvolving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and\nmulti-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches\nrequire task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time\nflexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion\nPlanner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances\nexploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame\ntest-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:\n(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle\nguidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined\nthrough fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the\nlimitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and\nharnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only\npretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three\ndiverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze\nmulti-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches on all tasks.

On a Siemens Sinumerik 828D\ncontroller digital twin, DynaMark achieves a reduction in watermark energy by\n70% while preserving the nominal trajectory, compared to constant variance\nbaselines.

However, this is often unattainable for complex\nsystems, such as those modeled by nonlinear partial differential equations. One\nstrategy for mitigating this issue is to construct a reduced-order model (ROM)\nthat enables more rapid optimization. In particular, the use of nonintrusive\nROMs -- those that do not require access to the full-order model at evaluation\ntime -- is popular because they facilitate optimization solutions can be\ncomputed within the wall-clock-time requirements. However, the optimization\nsolution will be unreliable if the iterates move outside the ROM training data.\nThis article proposes the use of hyper-differential sensitivity analysis with\nrespect to model discrepancy (HDSA-MD) as a computationally efficient tool to\naugment ROM-constrained optimization and improve its reliability. The proposed\napproach consists of two phases: (i) an offline phase where several full-order\nmodel evaluations are computed to train the ROM, and (ii) an online phase where\na ROM-constrained optimization problem is solved, $N=\\mathcal{O}(1)$ full-order\nmodel evaluations are computed, and HDSA-MD is used to enhance the optimization\nsolution using the full-order model data. Numerical results are demonstrated\nfor two examples, atmospheric contaminant control and wildfire ignition\nlocation estimation, in which a ROM is trained offline using inaccurate\natmospheric data.

    "abstract": "Extracting cosmological information from microwave sky observations requires\naccurate estimation of the underlying Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by\nremoving foreground contamination, instrumental noise, and the effects of beam\nconvolution. In this work, we develop a machine learning-based approach\n  for CMB reconstruction using a generative adversarial network (GAN)\narchitecture, where the generator is modeled as a U-Net-based convolutional\nneural network. To train the network, we generate realistic microwave sky maps\nby simulating Planck-like observations: scanning HEALPix-simulated skies with\nreal Planck beam profile, actual scan patterns, and anisotropic noise\nconsistent with Planck data. Our method achieves high-fidelity reconstruction,\nwith the difference between the input and recovered maps being less than\n$2\\mu\\mathrm{K}$ (approximately $1\\%$) outside the Galactic region. Even within\nthe Galactic plane, the reconstruction error remains below $2-3\\%$ in most\nareas, except for a few isolated pixels. Most importantly, we demonstrate for\nthe first time that a GAN-based method can effectively correct for both\nforeground contamination and the systematic effects of non-circular beams and\nthe asymmetric Planck scan pattern. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our method for robust and accurate recovery of the CMB signal, even in the\npresence of strong astrophysical foregrounds and instrumental systematics.",

Existing methods either discard device-specific\ninformation, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their\nreal-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns\nlatent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream\npredictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.\nSpecifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source\nheterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user\nheterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term\nphysiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a\ndiscriminative representation space.

McGinnis and Zerbib had 6 families instead of\n5, so I also improve their result in this respect. Moreover, the result can\nalso be extended to unbounded families, if we allow the piercing lines to be\nparallel.",

    "abstract": "We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where\nneither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of\ntasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the\nunder-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos\nrepresent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in\nmany applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in\nunsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised\ncontinual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,\nwhile having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we\nstudy the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more\nchallenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of\nprocessing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark\nexperimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured\nvideo data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density\nEstimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised\nvideo transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of\nthe data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task\ndata, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture\nnew knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of\ntransfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge\ntransfer to the current learning task.

Whereas most existing\nstudies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,\nopen-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are\ninterested in asking: What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in the\nlearning process? To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting of\nvarious types of unusual atypical data (e.g., sci-fi, animation, etc.). To\nstudy how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into\nthe model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key\ntasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel\ncategory discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found\nthat even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently\nimprove performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that\nincreasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD\ndetection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more\nsemantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance\ncompared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the\nsemantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to\nunseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental\nevaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation\nlearning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,\nencouraging further studies in this direction.

To better\nassess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP\nencounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating\non 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after\nfine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'\nsome domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance\ndeteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present\nCLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware\nrepresentations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while\nstandard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,\nthis can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of\ndomain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead\nhypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective\ndomain-invariant classification in foundation models.

Despite\nrecent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most\napproaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic\ncorrespondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the\npresence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to\npositive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single\nvisible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key\ncontributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates\nsilence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being\nmore robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,\nSSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other\nself-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.\nSecond, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment\nand separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative\naudio-visual pairs.

    "abstract": "Recent observations have confirmed that a significant fraction of the coronal\nAlfvenic wave spectrum originates in the photosphere. These waves travel from\nthe photosphere to the corona, overcoming the barriers of reflection and\ndissipation posed by the chromosphere. Previous studies have theoretically\ncalculated the chromospheric reflection, transmission, and absorption\ncoefficients for pure Alfven waves under the assumption of stationary\npropagation. Here, we relax that assumption and investigate the time-dependent\npropagation of Alfven waves driven at the photosphere. Using an idealized\nchromospheric background model, we compare the coefficients obtained from\ntime-dependent simulations with those derived under the stationary\napproximation. Additionally, we examine the impact of the spatial resolution in\nthe numerical simulations. Considering a spatial resolution of 250 m, we find\nthat the time-dependent transmission coefficient converges to the stationary\nvalue across the entire frequency range after only a few chromospheric Alfven\ncrossing times, while the reflectivity displays a good convergence for\nfrequencies lower than 30 mHz. The absorption coefficient also converges for\nwave frequencies above 1 mHz, for which chromospheric dissipation is\nsignificant. In contrast, at lower frequencies, wave energy dissipation is weak\nand the time-dependent simulations typically overestimate the absorption.\nInadequate spatial resolution artificially enhances the chromospheric\nreflectivity, reduces wave transmission to the corona, and poorly describes the\nwave energy absorption. Overall, the differences between the stationary and\ntime-dependent approaches are only minor and gradually decrease as spatial\nresolution and simulation time increase, which reinforces the validity of the\nstationary approximation.",

Using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics\nsimulations, we explore thermal transport and coupled effects in supercooled\nNaCl and LiCl solutions (1-4 m, 200-300 K). At 1 m, thermal conductivity\nexhibits a pronounced minimum near 220 K, coinciding with maxima in isothermal\ncompressibility and minima in the speed of sound, both of which are signatures\nof critical fluctuations. The anomalies progressively diminish with increasing\nsalt concentration and vanish at 4 m, suggesting suppression of the LLPT. The\nSoret coefficient exhibits a striking behavior. Initially thermophobic at high\ntemperatures (> 280 K), becoming thermophilic upon cooling, then reverting to\nthermophobic below 220 K.

    "abstract": "Recent discoveries of faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the redshift\nfrontier have revealed a plethora of broad \\Halpha emitters with optically red\ncontinua, named Little Red Dots (LRDs), which comprise 15-30\\% of the high\nredshift broad line AGN population. Due to their peculiar spectral properties\nand X-ray weakness, modeling LRDs with standard AGN templates has proven\nchallenging. In particular, the validity of single-epoch virial mass estimates\nin determining the black hole (BH) masses of LRDs has been called into\nquestion, with some models claiming that masses might be overestimated by up to\n2 orders of magnitude, and other models claiming that LRDs may be entirely\nstellar in nature. We report the direct, dynamical BH mass measurement in a\nstrongly lensed LRD at $z = 7.04$. The combination of lensing with deep\nspectroscopic data reveals a rotation curve that is inconsistent with a nuclear\nstar cluster, yet can be well explained by Keplerian rotation around a point\nmass of 50 million Solar masses, consistent with virial BH mass estimates from\nthe Balmer lines. The Keplerian rotation leaves little room for any stellar\ncomponent in a host galaxy, as we conservatively infer $M_{\\rm BH}/M_{*}>2$.\nSuch a ''naked'' black hole, together with its near-pristine environment,\nindicates that this LRD is a massive black hole seed caught in its earliest\naccretion phase.",

    "abstract": "Studying young, high-mass stellar objects is challenging for testing models\nof massive star formation due to their great distances, often kiloparsecs away.\nThis requires extremely high-angular resolution to resolve features like\naccretion discs around massive protostars. Consequently, while powerful,\ncollimated outflows are evident in massive protostars, the compact accretion\ndiscs anticipated at their centres are still proving difficult to pinpoint.\nThis study presents ALMA continuum and molecular line observations at 1.3 mm of\nthe massive protostar W75N(B)-VLA3. The observations achieve an angular\nresolution of $\\sim$0.12$^{\\prime\\prime}$ ($\\sim$156 au). Dense gas tracers\nreveal a circumstellar disc of $\\sim$450 au in radius surrounding VLA3, with an\norientation perpendicular to its associated thermal radio jet. From the\nmillimetre continuum, a total mass of $\\approx$0.43-1.74 $M_\\odot$ is estimated\nfor the disc. The disc's velocity profile is consistent with Keplerian rotation\naround a protostar of $\\approx$16 $M_\\odot$. This adds VLA3 to the small number\nof massive disc-protostar-jet systems documented in the literature with a\ncentrifugally supported disc with a radius less than 500 au. Additionally, we\ndetected H30$\\alpha$ recombination line emission towards the radio jet powered\nby VLA3. Despite limitations in the spatial and spectral resolution, our data\nreveal a very broad line, indicative of high-velocity motions, as well as a\ntentative velocity gradient in the jet's direction, thus favouring the\nH30$\\alpha$ emission to originate from the radio jet. Should this\ninterpretation be confirmed with new observations, W75N(B)-VLA3 could represent\nthe first protostellar radio jet for which a thermal radio recombination line\nhas been detected.",

Pure theoretical analysis\nindicates that the leading order effect of the gravitational constant variation\ncorrects the amplitude of gravitational waves, and the second order effect\ncorrects the phase of gravitational waves. As the matched filtering technique\nis used by gravitational wave data analysis, the phase is more important than\nthe amplitude. In the current paper we use LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA data to constrain\nthe gravitational constant variation. Our findings indicate that we need to\nwait until the distance of the detected gravitational wave events and/or the\nsignal-to-noise ratio increases by $2n$ orders compared to the current\ndetection state, and then we can use phase correction to get constraint\n$|\\frac{G'}{G}|<10^{-n}$/yr for gravitational wave events without\nelectromagnetic counterparts.

In this\npaper, we present our study on the impact of enhanced EUV flux on the stability\nand escape of the upper atmosphere of an Earth-like exoplanet using the Global\nIonosphere and Thermosphere Model (GITM). We also investigate the differences\nbetween one- and three-dimensional solutions. We use a baseline case of EUV\nflux experienced at the Earth, and multiplying this flux by a constant factor\ngoing up to 50. Our results show a clear evidence of an inflated and elevated\nionosphere due to enhanced EUV flux, and they provide a detailed picture of how\ndifferent heating and cooling rates, as well as the conductivity are changing\nat each EUV flux level. Our results also demonstrate that one-dimensional\nsolutions are limited in their ability to capture a global atmosphere that are\nnot uniform. We find that a threshold EUV flux level for a stable atmosphere\noccurs around a factor of 10 times the baseline level, where EUV fluxes above\nthis level indicate a rapidly escaping atmosphere. This threshold EUV flux\ntranslates to about 0.3AU for a planet orbiting the Sun.

A lightweight, pipelined SFT\ntraining phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing\ncore regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Current measurement approaches\nface significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to\nscale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for\nrural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework\nwas proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a\ntop-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146\ncounties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image\ncomparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation\nto determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations.\nBuilding on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for\nnationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both\nliving quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced\nthe rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this\nstudy characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China\nand thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The\nrural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern,\nradiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients;\n(2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as\nthe core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit\nenhancement in livability.

This study investigates the interactions between ionized glyphosate and\nsingle-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) using computational simulations through\nsemi-empirical tight-binding methods (GFN2-xTB) implemented in the xTB\nsoftware. The analysis focused on different glyphosate ionization states\ncorresponding to various pH levels: G1 (pH < 2), G2 (pH ~ 2-3), G3 (pH ~ 4-6),\nG4 (pH ~ 7-10), and G5 (pH > 10.6). Results revealed that glyphosate in G1, G3,\nG4, and G5 forms exhibited stronger interactions with CNT, demonstrating higher\nadsorption energies and greater electronic coupling. The neutral state (G2)\nshowed lower affinity, indicating that molecular protonation significantly\ninfluences adsorption. Topological analysis and molecular dynamics confirmed\nthe presence of covalent, non-covalent, and partially covalent interactions,\nwhile the CNT+G5 system demonstrated moderate interactions suitable for\nmaterial recycling.

By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and\nhigh-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled\nsynthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present\nDMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images\ndesigned to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.\nBenchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein\nSimilarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with\nCAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL\nshowcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks.

However,\ngenerally it has not been well established how to optimize these two properties\nsimultaneously, because these two properties are usually not independent from\neach other. Therefore, the scheme for high fidelity operation by simultaneous\ntuning Rabi frequency and coherence time, which does not rely on the\nmaterial-dependent strong spin-orbit interaction and the local magnetic field\ngradient limiting their scalability, are strongly demanded. Here, we\ndemonstrate an approach to achieve high-fidelity spin control by tuning\ninter-dot spin-orbit coupling in a GaAs triple quantum dot (TQD), where the\nthird dot provides precise control over orbital energy levels. In an\nelectrically stable charge state with optimized tunnel coupling, we achieve\nRabi frequencies exceeding 100 MHz while maintaining coherence through proper\ntuning of the inter-dot orbital levels of the TQD. By implementing a machine\nlearning-based feedback control that efficiently estimates qubit frequency\nusing past measurement data, we characterize and mitigate the impact of low\nfrequency noise on qubit coherence with minimal measurement overhead. Finally,\nwe demonstrate a $\\pi$/2 gate fidelity of 99.7\\% with a gate time of 4 ns\nthrough randomized benchmarking, even in a GaAs quantum dot device where\nelectron spin coherence is typically limited by strong hyperfine interaction\nwith nuclear spins. Our approach provides a scalable strategy for high-fidelity\nspin control in semiconductor quantum dot arrays by utilizing device-specific\nparameters rather than relying on material properties or external field\ngradients.",

    "abstract": "Amid global interest in resilient energy systems, green hydrogen is\nconsidered vital to the net-zero transition, yet its deployment remains limited\nby high production cost. The cost is determined by the its production pathway,\nsystem configuration, asset location, and interplay with electricity markets\nand regulatory frameworks. To compare different deployment strategies in the\nUK, we develop a comprehensive techno-economic framework based on the Levelised\nCost of Hydrogen (LCOH) assessment. We apply this framework to 5 configurations\nof wind-electrolyser systems, identify the most cost-effective business cases,\nand conduct a sensitivity analysis of key economic parameters. Our results\nreveal that electricity cost is the dominant contributor to LCOH, followed by\nthe electrolyser cost. Our work highlights the crucial role that location,\nmarket arrangements and control strategies among RES and hydrogen investors\nplay in the economic feasibility of deploying green hydrogen systems. Policies\nthat subsidise low-cost electricity access and optimise deployment can lower\nLCOH, enhancing the economic competitiveness of green hydrogen.",

While forecasting mental health scores alone offers\nlimited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,\nquasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity\nDesign (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are\nmore likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the\nsize of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for\nanxiety) due to a time-specific event.

    "abstract": "Quantum circuits are typically represented by a (ordered) sequence of gates\nover a set of virtual qubits. During compilation, the virtual qubits of the\ngates are assigned to the physical qubits of the underlying quantum hardware, a\nstep often referred to as the qubit assignment problem. To ensure that the\nresulting circuit respects hardware connectivity constraints, additional SWAP\ngates are inserted as needed, which is known as the qubit routing problem.\nTogether, they are called the Qubit Mapping Problem (QMP), which is known to be\nNP-hard. A very common way to deal with the complexity of the QMP is to\npartition the sequence of gates into a sequence of gate groups (or layers).\nHowever, this imposes a couple of important restrictions: (1) SWAP gates can\nonly be added between pairs of consecutive groups, and (2) all the gates\nbelonging to a certain group have to be executed (in parallel) in the same time\nslot. The first one prevents gates to be re-arranged optimally, while the\nsecond one imposes a time discretization that practically ignores gate\nexecution time. While this clearly reduces the size of the feasible space,\nlittle is still known about how much is actually lost by imposing a fixed\nlayering when looking at the minimization of either the number of SWAPs or the\nmakespan of the compiled circuit. In this paper, we present a flexible branch\nand bound algorithm for a generalized version of the QMP that either considers\nor ignores the gate layering and the gate execution time. The algorithm can\nfind find proven optimal solutions for all variations of the QMP, but also\noffers a great platform for different heuristic algorithms. We present results\non several benchmark sets of small quantum circuits, and we show how ignoring\nthe layering can significantly improve some key performance indicators of the\ncompiled circuit.",

We compare the properties of strong UV line\nemitters, as traced by intense CIV emission, with those of more \"typical\"\nsources with weak or undetected CIV. The more typical (or \"CIV-weak\") sources\nreveal significant scatter in their CIII] line strengths, UV continuum slopes,\nand physical sizes, spanning CIII] equivalent widths of ~1-51 \\r{A}, UV slopes\nof $\\beta$~-1.6 to -2.6, and half-light radii of ~50-1000 pc. In contrast,\nCIV-strong sources generally occupy the tail of these distributions, with CIII]\nEWs of 16-51 \\r{A}, UV slopes $\\beta$<-2.5, compact morphologies ($r_{50}$<100\npc), and elevated star formation surface densities ($\\Sigma_{SFR}$>100\n$M_{\\odot}yr^{-1}kpc^{-2}$). Collectively these properties are consistent with\nconcentrated starbursts that temporarily outshine the extended structure of the\ngalaxy. Comparing average properties from composite spectra, we find the\ndiversity of the sample is primarily driven by bursts and lulls of star\nformation on very short timescales (<3 Myr), where strong CIV emitters are\nobserved at the apex of these phases and sources devoid of emission lines\nrepresent periods of relative inactivity. An apparent association between\nstrong CIV and enhanced nitrogen abundance suggests both features may be\nmodulated by the same duty cycle and reflect a generic mode of star formation.\nWe show that AGN are unlikely to be a significant contributor to this duty\ncycle based on a comparison of UV line diagnostics to photoionisation models,\nalthough some non-thermal activity cannot be fully ruled out. Our results\nsupport a unified evolutionary picture whereby transient bursts and lulls can\nexplain the spectral diversity and early growth of bright galaxies in the first\n500 Myr.",

We hypothesise that an uneven distribution\nof retrievability scores across the entire collection may not accurately\nreflect exposure bias but rather indicate variations in topical relevance. As a\nsolution, we propose a topic-focused localised retrievability measure, which we\ncall \\textit{T-Retrievability} (topic-retrievability), which first computes\nretrievability scores over multiple groups of topically-related documents, and\nthen aggregates these localised values to obtain the collection-level\nstatistics.

The\nmodels predict the basic wind parameters, namely, the wind mass-loss rates and\nterminal velocities just from the stellar parameters. In general, the wind\nmass-loss rates decrease with decreasing metallicity and this relationship\nsteepens for very low metallicities, $Z\\lesssim0.1\\,Z_\\odot$. Down to\nmetallicities corresponding to the Magellanic Clouds and even lower, the\npredicted mass-loss rates reasonably agree with observational estimates.\nHowever, the theoretical and observational mass-loss rates for very low\nmetallicities exhibit significant scatter. We show that the scatter of\nobservational values can be caused by inefficient shock cooling in the stellar\nwind, which leaves a considerable fraction of the wind at too high temperatures\nwith waning observational signatures.

    "abstract": "To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,\nout-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to\nthe training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).\nIn this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular\nvalue decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to\ndecompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,\nwhich contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier\noutput. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively\ndistinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large\ndistribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective\nleaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that\nare ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of\nsmaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods\nprofit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant\ncomponent can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two\nfindings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art\nresults in various standard OOD benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Architected materials of significant geometric complexity offer exceptional\nmechanical properties that often surpass those of their constituent materials.\nHowever, their fabrication through extrusion-based 3D printing remains hindered\nby suboptimal printing trajectories, which is inherent to commercial slicing\nsoftware. They produce multiple non-continuous paths that compromise\nfabrication time, shape fidelity, and structural integrity, particularly for\nthin-walled lattice structures. To address this issue, we introduce GIPPO\n(Graph-based, Iterative, Printing-Path Optimization), an open-source slicing\nplatform that transforms complex lattice designs into optimized printing\ntrajectories. Lattices are converted to graph networks to derive the optimal\nprinting trajectories through a modified version of Prim's algorithm. The\nresulting paths are translated back to Euclidean coordinates and exported as a\nready-to-use G-code. We validated GIPPO's performance against conventional\nslicing software across six architected lattice geometries fabricated from\nthermoplastic polyurethane using fused deposition modeling. GIPPO-optimized\nconstructs demonstrated superior shape fidelity with reduced local thickness\ndeviations, no missing struts, and minimized excess material deposition\ncompared to conventionally printed controls. Mechanical testing revealed that\nprinting path optimization directly influences both uniaxial and out-of-plane\nmechanical responses, with different optimization strategies yielding distinct\nperformance characteristics suited to specific loading conditions. Moreover,\nthe platform accommodates both planar and non-planar printing geometries and\nenables fabrication of objects with varying infill patterns per layer.

    "abstract": "Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each\ncharacter and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character\nsegmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in\nsequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first\ndetecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly\noutput full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of\nlanguage models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe\nthat the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word\nsegmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical\nprogression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to\nbypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for\nbetter utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not\nonly improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough\nliterature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark\nsuch shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a\nmeticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level\nannotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy\nimprovement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning\ntowards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4\ntimes improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines.

There is extensive evidence supporting\nthis conjecture for many families, including the family of holomorphic cusp\nnewforms.

    "abstract": "Pedestrians approaching each other on a sidewalk sometimes end up in an\nawkward interaction known as the \"sidewalk salsa\": they both (repeatedly)\ndeviate to the same side to avoid a collision. This provides an interesting use\ncase to study interactions between pedestrians and mobile robots because, in\nthe vast majority of cases, this phenomenon is avoided through a negotiation\nbased on implicit communication. Understanding how it goes wrong and how\npedestrians end up in the sidewalk salsa will therefore provide insight into\nthe implicit communication. This understanding can be used to design safe and\nacceptable robotic behaviour. In a previous attempt to gain this understanding,\na model of pedestrian behaviour based on the Communication-Enabled Interaction\n(CEI) framework was developed that can replicate the sidewalk salsa. However,\nit is unclear how to leverage this model in robotic planning and\ndecision-making since it violates the assumptions of game theory, a much-used\nframework in planning and decision-making. Here, we present a proof-of-concept\nfor an approach where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent leverages the model\nto learn how to interact with pedestrians. The results show that a basic RL\nagent successfully learned to interact with the CEI model. Furthermore, a\nrisk-averse RL agent that had access to the perceived risk of the CEI model\nlearned how to effectively communicate its intention through its motion and\nthereby substantially lowered the perceived risk, and displayed effort by the\nmodelled pedestrian.

    "abstract": "Geometric frustration is recognized to generate complex morphologies in\nself-assembling particulate and molecular systems. In bulk states, frustrated\ndrives structured arrays of topological defects. In the dilute limit, these\nsystems have been shown to form a novel state of self-limiting assembly, in\nwhich the equilibrium size of multi-particle domains are finite and\nwell-defined. In this article, we employ Monte Carlo simulations of a recently\ndeveloped 2D lattice model of geometrically frustrated\nassembly~\\cite{HackneyPhysRevX.13.041010} to study the phase transitions\nbetween the self-limiting and defect bulk phase driven by two distinct\nmechanisms: (i) increasing concentration and (ii) decreasing temperature or\nfrustration. The first transition is mediated by a concentration-driven\npercolation transition of self-limiting, worm-like domains into an intermediate\nheterogeneous network mesophase, which gradually fills in at high concentration\nto form a quasi-uniform defect bulk state. We find that the percolation\nthreshold is weakly dependent on frustration and shifts to higher concentration\nas frustration is increased, but depends strongly on the ratio of cohesion to\nelastic stiffness in the model. The second transition takes place between\nself-limiting assembly at high-temperature/frustration and phase separation\ninto a condensed bulk state at low temperature/frustration. We consider the\ncompeting influences that translational and conformational entropy have on the\ncritical temperature/frustration and show that the self-limiting phase is\nstabilized at higher frustrations and temperatures than previously expected.\nTaken together, this understanding of the transition pathways from\nself-limiting to bulk defect phases of frustrated assembly allows us to map the\nphase behavior of this 2D minimal model over the full range of concentration.",

By measuring the tangential shear around\nspectroscopic lens galaxies from GAMA, SDSS, and DESI, divided into fifteen\nnarrow redshift bins, we compute shear ratios that are sensitive to the mean\nredshift of source galaxies. Using a blinded analysis, we derive constraints on\nthe photo-$z$ bias parameters in source bins 2, 3 and 4, achieving\nsignal-to-noise ratios of 59, 75, and 62, respectively. Our constraints for\n$\\Delta z_2$, $\\Delta z_3$ and $\\Delta z_4$ are consistent with those from\nHSC-Y3 cosmic shear modeling. We observe a mild shift in the $\\Delta\nz_3$-$\\Delta z_4$ plane due to the heterogeneous depth of the lens sample,\nwhich disappears when using only DESI-DR1 lenses. Combining shear-ratio\nmeasurements with cosmic shear data, we obtain joint constraints on\ncosmological parameters: $\\Omega_{\\rm m} = 0.286_{-0.074}^{+0.038}$ and $S_8 =\n0.760_{-0.145}^{+0.044}$, consistent with cosmic shear-only results.

While fully automated\nmethods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches\nthat keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The\nautoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive\nsegmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present\nour submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,\nwe extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided\nforeground and background clicks as additional input channels.

Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user\ninteractions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under\nrealistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with\nand without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,\nreducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.\nThese results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,\nuser-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT.

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes foundational to enterprise\ninfrastructure, organizations face growing challenges in accurately assessing\nthe full economic implications of AI deployment. Existing metrics such as API\ntoken costs, GPU-hour billing, or Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) fail to capture\nthe complete lifecycle costs of AI systems and provide limited comparability\nacross deployment models. This paper introduces the Levelized Cost of\nArtificial Intelligence (LCOAI), a standardized economic metric designed to\nquantify the total capital (CAPEX) and operational (OPEX) expenditures per unit\nof productive AI output, normalized by valid inference volume. Analogous to\nestablished metrics like LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) and LCOH\n(levelized cost of hydrogen) in the energy sector, LCOAI offers a rigorous,\ntransparent framework to evaluate and compare the cost-efficiency of vendor API\ndeployments versus self-hosted, fine-tuned models. We define the LCOAI\nmethodology in detail and apply it to three representative scenarios, OpenAI\nGPT-4.1 API, Anthropic Claude Haiku API, and a self-hosted LLaMA-2-13B\ndeployment demonstrating how LCOAI captures critical trade-offs in scalability,\ninvestment planning, and cost optimization. Extensive sensitivity analyses\nfurther explore the impact of inference volume, CAPEX, and OPEX variability on\nlifecycle economics. The results illustrate the practical utility of LCOAI in\nprocurement, infrastructure planning, and automation strategy, and establish it\nas a foundational benchmark for AI economic analysis. Policy implications and\nareas for future refinement, including environmental and performance-adjusted\ncost metrics, are also discussed.",

We validate ExSEnt on canonical nonlinear dynamical systems (Logistic\nmap, Rossler system, Rulkov map), demonstrating its ability to track complexity\nchanges across control parameter sweeps and detect transitions between periodic\nand chaotic regimes. Then, we illustrate the empirical utility of ExSEnt\nmetrics to isolate feature-specific sources of complexity in real data\n(electromyography and ankle acceleration in Parkinsons disease).

They represent a rare population of galaxies hosting\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs) accreting near the Eddington limit at\nredshifts z \\sim 1--4. In this study, we compare their multi-wavelength SEDs to\ninvestigate whether LRDs, or a subset of them, could be high-redshift analogs\nof BHDs. Our analysis reveals that despite their similar \"V-shape\" SEDs, LRDs\nappear to be a different population than BHDs. The \"V-shape\" of BHDs appear at\nlonger wavelengths compared to LRDs due to different selection strategies,\nsuggesting LRDs have much less dust attenuation than typical BHDs. The bluer\ncolors in the rest-frame infrared (continuum) emission of LRDs suggest the\nabsence of hot dust heated by AGN accretion activities. We also argue that the\nblue excess in LRDs is unlikely from AGN scattered light. The compact\nmorphologies and lower X-ray detection frequencies of LRDs suggest a distinct\nformation pathway from BHDs -- which are thought to be powered by\nsuper-Eddington accretion onto central SMBHs following major galaxy mergers.",

Based on this, one expects that generating pairs\n$(A, B)$ of $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ for which $\\mathrm{tr}([A, B]) = k$\ndetermine a single orbit of $\\mathrm{M}_k(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, and the remaining\nexceptional orbits come from non-generating pairs of\n$\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$.\n  In this article, we describe the set of exceptional orbits of\n$\\mathrm{M}_k(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, showing that they agree with the finite orbits of\nthe equation $\\mathrm{M}_k$ over $\\mathbb{C}$ found by Dubrovin and Mazzocco.\nFurthermore, we prove that the conjecture of McCullough and Wanderley is\nequivalent to strong approximation when $p \\equiv 3 \\mod{4}$. Lastly, we\npresent the recent developments of Chen on the problem and use our\nclassification of exceptional orbits to make a divisibility conjecture about\nthe size of the largest orbit of $\\mathrm{M}_k(\\mathbb{F}_p)$.",

Despite their\nremarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has\nassessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies,\na critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and\ninterfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19\nstate-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously\nestablished density functional theory (DFT) database of 36,718 slab structures\nspanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds.

In\ncontrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets\nshow five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data\nfail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation.

Our simulations show\nthat confinement markedly amplifies the otherwise elusive splay-bend order,\nprimarily by suppressing the intrinsic three-dimensional heliconical structure\ncharacteristic of bulk $\\mathrm{N_{TB}}$.\n  Remarkably, when the $\\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ phase is confined between parallel\nwalls imposing planar anchoring, and the bulk wave vector is oriented parallel\nto the walls, a smectic splay-bend ($\\mathrm{S_{SB}}$) phase spontaneously\nemerges near the confining surfaces. This intermediate structure subsequently\ntransforms into the bulk $\\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ phase either directly via a smectic\nsplay-bend-twist ($\\mathrm{S_{SBT}}$) phase or through a sequence involving\nboth the $\\mathrm{S_{SBT}}$ and the nematic splay-bend-twist\n($\\mathrm{N_{SBT}}$) phases. Notably, the $\\mathrm{N_{SBT}}$ phase becomes\nparticularly pronounced as the molecular bend angle approaches its maximum\nattainable value in bulk $\\mathrm{N_{TB}}$; this regime occurs in close\nproximity to the $\\mathrm{N}\\text{--}\\mathrm{S_{A}}\\text{--}\\mathrm{S_{SB}}$\ntriple point on the bulk phase diagram.\n  Our findings reveal a compelling and intricate interplay among chirality,\nconfinement, and molecular ordering, further evidenced by the calculated\nelementary director distortions. Crucially, this study opens promising avenues\nfor experimental exploration: confined thin-film geometries serve as powerful\nmodel systems for revealing and characterizing novel nematic and smectic\nliquid-crystal phases that remain elusive in, or currently inaccessible to,\nbulk experiments.",

We aim to model the\nbroadband gamma-ray data, discriminating plausible scenarios amongst all\ncandidate accelerators. We consider in particular relic hadronic emission from\na supernova remnant expanding in a low-density environment and inverse Compton\nemission from stellar-wind termination shocks in the Cygnus OB2 stellar\nassociation. We first estimate the maximum particle energy from a 3D\nhydrodynamical simulation of the supernova remnant scenario. The transport\nequation is then solved numerically to determine the radial distribution of\nnon-thermal protons and electrons. In order to compute synthetic gamma-ray\nspectra and emission maps, we develop a 3D model of the gas distribution. This\nincludes, firstly, a HI component with a low-density superbubble around Cygnus\nOB2 and, secondly, molecular clouds lying at the edge of the superbubble and in\nthe foreground. We find that a powerful, ~50 kyr-old supernova remnant can\naccount for both the morphology and spectrum from 10 TeV-PeV. At PeV energies,\nthe microquasar Cygnus X-3 and diffuse Galactic cosmic rays might also\ncontribute to the flux. Below about 10 TeV, hadronic models are incompatible\nwith the expected existence of a superbubble centred on Cygnus OB2. Instead,\nthe spectrum is well fitted with inverse Compton emission from electrons\naccelerated at stellar-wind termination shocks in Cygnus OB2 in line with\nexisting multi-wavelength limits.",

    "abstract": "The growing integration of renewable energy sources into power systems\nrequires planning models to account for not only demand variability but also\nfluctuations in renewable availability during operational periods. Capturing\nthis temporal detail over long planning horizons can be computationally\ndemanding or even intractable. A common approach to address this challenge is\nto approximate the problem using a reduced set of selected time periods, known\nas representative periods (RPs). However, using too few RPs can significantly\ndegrade solution quality. In this paper, we propose a novel method -- hull\nclustering with blended RPs -- that enhances traditional clustering-based RP\napproaches in two key ways. First, instead of selecting typical cluster centers\n(e.g., centroids or medoids) as RPs, our method is based on extreme points,\nwhich are more likely to be constraint-binding. Second, it represents base\nperiods as weighted combinations of RPs (e.g., convex or conic blends),\nenabling a more accurate approximation of the full time horizon with fewer RPs.\nThrough two case studies based on data from the European network operators, we\ndemonstrate that hull clustering with blended RPs outperforms traditional RP\ntechniques in both regret and computational efficiency.",

The focus is on environments where energy demand is concentrated in\nspecific areas, referred to as 'hotspots', spatial zones with higher user\ndensity or consistent energy requirements. We formulate a joint clustering and\nradio stripe deployment problem that aims to maximize the minimum received\npower across all hotspots. To address the complexity, we decouple the problem\ninto two stages: i) clustering for assigning radio stripes to hotspots based on\ntheir spatial positions and near-field propagation characteristics, and ii)\nantenna element placement optimization. In particular, we propose four radio\nstripe deployment algorithms. Two are based on general successive convex\napproximation (SCA) and signomial programming (SGP) methods. The other two are\nshape-constrained solutions where antenna elements are arranged along either\nstraight lines or regular polygons, enabling simpler deployment. Numerical\nresults show that the proposed clustering method converges effectively, with\nChebyshev initialization significantly outperforming random initialization. The\noptimized deployments consistently outperform baseline benchmarks across a wide\nrange of frequencies and radio stripe lengths, while the polygon-shaped\ndeployment achieves better performance compared to other approaches. Meanwhile,\nthe line-shaped deployment demonstrates an advantage under high boresight gain\nsettings, benefiting from increased spatial diversity and broader angular\ncoverage.",

Bounded suboptimal search\nusing several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in\nMulti-Heuristic A* (MHA*).

We study the application of spinor and twistor methods to three\ndimensional conformal field theories in these notes. They are divided into\nthree parts dealing with spinor helicity, twistors and super-twistors\nrespectively. In the first part, we introduce the off-shell spinor helicity\nformalism and apply it in several contexts including double copy relations,\nconnection to four dimensional scattering amplitudes, correlators in\nChern-Simons matter theories and the holography of chiral higher spin theory.\nThe second part of the notes introduces the twistor space formalism. After\ndiscussing the geometry of twistor space, we derive the Penrose transform for\nconserved currents, scalars with arbitrary scaling dimension as well as generic\nnon-conserved operators. We also explicitly show how the spinor and twistor\napproaches are related. We discuss how correlators of these operators and\nconserved currents in particular drastically simplify in twistor space\nunveiling their hidden simplicity. We also extend our construction to\nsuper-conformal field theories and develop a manifest super-twistor space\nformalism and derive the supersymmetric Penrose transform. We find that the\nsupersymmetric correlators are simple and natural generalizations of their\nnon-supersymmetric counterparts.

In this work we aim to understand how the\nsuper-Earth population is affected by both the stellar mass, the size of the\nprotoplanetary disc, and viscous heating. We utilise a standard protoplanetary\ndisc model with both irradiated and viscous heating together with a pebble\naccretion model to simulate the formation and migration of planets. We find\nthat if the disc is heated purely through stellar irradiation, inwards\nmigration of super-Earths is very efficient, resulting in the close-in\nsuper-Earth fraction increasing with increasing stellar mass. In contrast, when\nviscous heating is included, planets can undergo outwards migration, delaying\nmigration to the inner edge of the protoplanetary disc, which causes a fraction\nof super-Earth planets to grow to become giant planets instead. This results in\na significant reduction of inner super-Earths around high-mass stars and an\nincrease in the number of giant planets, both of which mirror observed features\nof the planet population around high-mass stars. This effect is most pronounced\nwhen the protoplanetary disc is large, since such discs evolve over a longer\ntime-scale. We also test a model when we inject protoplanets at a fixed time\nearly on in the disc lifetime. In this case, the fraction of close-in\nsuper-Earths decreases with increasing stellar mass in both the irradiated case\nand viscous case, since longer disc lifetimes around high-mass stars allows for\nplanets to grow into giants instead of super-Earths for most injection\nlocations.",

    "abstract": "The ability to control topological properties of laser emission represents a\nfundamental advancement in photonic technology. Achieving topological laser in\na single compact photonic structure is crucial for device integration and\nminiaturization but faces significant challenges for designing both the\nhigh-quality (high-Q) mode and radiative topological configurations. Recently,\nbound states in the continuum (BICs), as extraordinary states possessing both\nultrahigh Q factors and polarization topological charges, have been\ndemonstrated as a promising platform for compact topological lasers. However,\nas the cornerstone of BIC lasing's non-trivial properties, topological charges\nof BICs are protected by real-space structural symmetries, which simultaneously\nimpose fundamental limitations that hinder their designability of lasing\ntopological charges. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a compound\ncavity design method based on the M\\\"{o}bius-like correspondence in quasi-BICs\n(q-BICs), by which compact vectorial microlasers with designable topological\ncharges can be realized. We reveal the hidden connection between real-space\nsymmetry breaking and eigen-polarizations of q-BICs from the triangular\nphotonic crystal (PhC) slab, manifesting as a M\\\"{o}bius-like correspondence.\nBy splicing PhC slab sectors utilizing this M\\\"{o}bius-like correspondence, we\nestablish a one-to-one correspondence between compound cavities and their\nlasing topological charges. Vectorial lasing with designable topological\ncharges from $-5$ to $+5$ were experimentally realized. Our work establishes a\nnovel BIC-based platform that enables designable topological lasing, providing\na promising route toward compact topological sources.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzes the 2018 Chinese Household Income Project survey data to\nevaluate the income gaps between an \"outsider\" ethnic minority group, the\nMongols, an \"insider\" ethnic minority group, the Manchus, and the majority Han\ngroup in urban and rural areas of Liaoning province and Inner Mongolia in\nChina. Three statistical methods, a simple first-order OLS linear regression,\nlinear regressions with interaction terms, and the Blinder-Oaxaca\nDecomposition, are used to investigate the income disparity amongst the three\ngroups. The results indicate that Mongols suffer a significant ethnic wage\npenalty attributable to possible discrimination in the rural areas of these two\nprovinces, while the urban income gaps between the three groups can mostly be\nexplained by participation in public sector occupations or affiliation with the\nChinese Communist Party. In rural settings, Mongols also have higher returns to\npublic sector jobs and CCP membership compared to the other two ethnic groups.\nThe findings suggest that Chinese affirmative actions regarding ethnic policy\nare effective in accelerating the integration of ethnic minorities with Han in\nthe outcomes of the labor market.

The singular behaviour of thermodynamic quantities at the\ntransition, in particular, is determined by critical exponents of the\nuniversality class of the transition. However, critical properties are also\ncharacterised by the probability distribution of order parameter across the\ntransition, where non-Gaussian statistics are expected, but remain largely\nunexplored. Here, making use of single-atom-resolved detection in momentum\nspace, we measure the full probability distribution of the amplitude of the\norder parameter across a continuous phase transition in an interacting lattice\nBose gas. We find that fluctuations are captured by an effective potential --\nreconstructed from the measured probability distribution by analogy with Landau\ntheory -- displaying a non-trivial minimum in the superfluid (ordered) phase,\nwhich vanishes at the transition point. Additionally, we observe non-Gaussian\nstatistics of the order parameter near the transition, distinguished by\nnon-zero and oscillating high-order cumulants. We provide direct experimental\nevidence that these oscillations are universal, and show numerically that they\nexhibit critical scaling.

Measures such as the Economic Complexity Index\n(ECI) and the Product Space have proven their worth as robust estimators of an\neconomy's subsequent growth; less obvious, however, is how they have come to be\nso. Despite ECI drawing its micro-foundations from a combinatorial model of\ncapabilities, where a set of homogeneous capabilities combine to form products\nand the economies which can produce them, such a model is consistent with\nneither the fact that distinct product classes draw on distinct capabilities,\nnor the interrelations between different products in the Product Space which so\nmuch of economic complexity is based upon.\n  In this paper, we extend the combinatorial model of economic complexity\nthrough two innovations: an underlying network which governs the relatedness\nbetween capabilities, and a production function which trades the original\nbinary specialization function for a fine-grained, product-level output\nfunction. Using country-product trade data across 216 countries, 5000 products\nand two decades, we show that this model is able to accurately replicate both\nthe characteristic topology of the Product Space and the complexity\ndistribution of countries' export baskets. In particular, the model bridges the\ngap between the ECI and capabilities by transforming measures of economic\ncomplexity into direct measures of the capabilities held by an economy - a\ntransformation shown to both improve the informativeness of the Economic\nComplexity Index in predicting economic growth and enable an interpretation of\neconomic complexity as a proxy for productive structure in the form of\ncapability substitutability.",

This challenge becomes even more\ncomplex when the dynamics of the building change, for example, after a retrofit\nor a change in occupancy. In Machine Learning literature, Continual Learning\n(CL) methods are used to update models of changing systems. TL approaches can\nalso address this challenge by reusing the pretrained model at each update step\nand fine-tuning it with new measurement data.

This task is\nfurther complicated by domain shifts, including variations in organ, tissue\ntype, and scanner, as well as limited annotations and severe class imbalance.\nTo address these challenges in Track 2 of the MIDOG 2025 Challenge, we propose\na solution based on the lightweight ConvNeXt architecture, trained on all\navailable datasets (AMi-Br, AtNorM-Br, AtNorM-MD, and OMG-Octo) to maximize\ndomain coverage. Robustness is enhanced through a histopathology-specific\naugmentation pipeline, including elastic and stain-specific transformations,\nand balanced sampling to mitigate class imbalance. A grouped 5-fold\ncross-validation strategy ensures reliable evaluation. On the preliminary\nleaderboard, our model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8961, ranking among\nthe top entries.

    "abstract": "Accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation is critical for ensuring the\nsafety, reliability, and efficiency of lithium-ion batteries in electric\nvehicles and energy storage systems. Electrochemical models provide high\nfidelity for SOC estimation but introduce challenges due to parameter\nvariations, nonlinearities, and computational complexity. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes an adaptive dead-zone dual sliding mode\nobserver(SMO) based on an improved electrochemical single-particle model. The\nalgorithm integrates a state observer for SOC estimation and a parameter\nobserver for online parameter adaptation. A Lyapunov-derived adaptive dead-zone\nis introduced to ensure stability, activating parameter updates only when the\nterminal voltage error lies within a rigorously defined bound. The proposed\nmethod was validated under constant-current and UDDS dynamic conditions.\nResults demonstrate that the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO achieves superior\naccuracy compared with conventional dual SMO and equivalent circuit model-based\nEKF methods, maintaining SOC estimation errors within 0.2% under correct\ninitialization and below 1% under a 30% initial SOC error, with rapid\nconvergence. Computational efficiency analysis further shows that the adaptive\ndead-zone dual sliding mode observer reduces execution time compared with the\nconventional dual SMO by limiting unnecessary parameter updates, highlighting\nits suitability for real-time battery management applications. Moreover,\nrobustness under battery aging was confirmed using a cycle-aging model, where\nthe adaptive dead-zone dual SMO maintained stable SOC estimation despite\nparameter drift. These findings indicate that the proposed method offers a\nreliable, accurate, and computationally efficient solution for SOC estimation.",

An evaluation method combining\nexternal weak-field measurements with attenuation factor analysis is proposed\nto assess external magnetic flux errors in magnet-moving measurement schemes.\nThe findings demonstrate that selecting an optimal weighing position can reduce\nthe far-end flux effect to the order of $10^{-9}$.

However, it faces several\nlimitations, such as incompatibility with single-shot experiments, challenges\nin rotating complex sample environments that restrict the achievable rotation\nspeed or range, and the introduction of centrifugal forces that can affect the\nsample's dynamics. These limitations can hinder and even preclude the study of\ncertain dynamics. Here, we present an implementation of an alternative\napproach, X-ray Multi-Projection Imaging (XMPI), which eliminates the need for\nsample rotation. Instead, the direct incident X-ray beam is split into beamlets\nusing beam splitting X-ray optics. These beamlets intersect at the sample\nposition from different angular viewpoints, allowing multiple projections to be\nacquired simultaneously. We commissioned this setup at the ForMAX beamline at\nMAX IV. We present projections acquired from two different sample systems -\nfibers under mechanical load and particle suspension in multi-phase flow - with\ndistinct spatial and temporal resolution requirements. We demonstrate the\ncapabilities of the ForMAX XMPI setup using the detector's full dynamical range\nfor the relevant sample-driven spatiotemporal resolutions: i) at least 12.5 kHz\nframerates with 4 micrometer pixel sizes (fibers) and ii) 40 Hz acquisitions\nwith 1.3 micrometer pixel sizes (multi-phase flows), setting the basis for a\npermanent XMPI endstation at ForMAX.",

In the general setting of composite hypotheses, the\ngoal of QHT is to determine whether an unknown quantum state belongs to one or\nanother of two classes of states based on the measurement of a number of copies\nof the state. Prior art on QHT with composite hypotheses focused on a\nfixed-copy two-step protocol, with state estimation followed by an optimized\njoint measurement. However, this fixed-copy approach may be inefficient, using\nthe same number of copies irrespective of the inherent difficulty of the\ntesting task. To address these limitations, we introduce the quantum sequential\nuniversal test (QSUT), a novel framework for sequential QHT in the general case\nof composite hypotheses. QSUT builds on universal inference, and it alternates\nbetween adaptive local measurements aimed at exploring the hypothesis space and\njoint measurements optimized for maximal discrimination. QSUT is proven to\nrigorously control the type I error under minimal assumptions about the\nhypothesis structure.

We\nselected a sample of 13 powerful radio-quiet (RQ) ALQs, where the UV outflow\nkinetic power is measurable, and detected nine of them with the Very Large\nArray at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz. The radio emission is mostly unresolved,\nindicating no emission beyond a spatial scale of ~ 1-3 kpc. In the nine\ndetected objects, the radio spectral slope at 5.5-9.0 GHz is steep (< -0.5) in\nfive objects and is flat or inverted (> -0.5) in four objects. We discuss how\nthe steep-slope emission can be associated with the UV outflows, and how the\nflat-slope emission can be intrinsically steep but flattened by free-free\nabsorption from the UV outflowing gas. However, we find no correlation between\nthe radio luminosity and the estimated outflow kinetic power, which suggests\nthat the outflows are not a major source of the observed radio emission. In\naddition, the radio loudness of these RQ ALQs is comparable to that of typical\nRQ quasars, implying that the UV outflows do not lead to excess radio emission.\nFollow-up radio observations can test the free-free absorption interpretation\nand can be used as a new probe for outflows in AGN.",

In this work, we present the results of the first Bayesian search\nfor continuous pHz gravitational waves using the drift of two sensitive pulsar\ntiming parameters -- time derivative of pulsar binary orbital period\n$\\dot{P}_b$ and second order time derivative of pulsar spin period $\\ddot{P}$.\nWe apply our new technique to a dataset with more than double the number of\npulsars as previous searches in this frequency band, achieving an\norder-of-magnitude sensitivity improvement. No continuous wave signal is\ndetected in current data; however, we show that future observations by the\nSquare Kilometre Array will provide significantly improved sensitivity and the\nopportunity to observe continuous pHz signals, including the early stages of\nsupermassive black hole mergers. We explore the detection prospects for this\nsignal by extending existing population models into the pHz regime, finding\nthat future observations will probe phenomenologically-interesting parameter\nspace.

Any molecule can be considered a bipartite system in\nterms of electronic and nuclear halfspaces. Accordingly, the Schmidt\ndecomposition theorem can be applied to each molecular ansatz to find a much\nshorter representation in terms of Schmidt basis and to estimate the\nentanglement content through the calculation of von Neumann entropies. Although\nhere we justify that the ground BO vibronic state of any molecule may be\nregarded as an almost separable and non-entangled state, this property worsens\nwith the vibrational excitation, which increases the entanglement\nmonotonically. The interlace between electronic and nuclear wave functions for\neach vibronic state becomes even more critical for those electronic excited\nstates whose electronic wave functions change drastically with the molecular\ngeometry. We find that the entanglement may be quantified by the variation of\nthe electronic wave function along the different nuclear geometries, and that\nthe nuclear wave function indeed plays the role of a tester. In addition, the\npresence of avoided crossings among the potential energy curves brings about a\nstrong enhancement of entanglement in the Born-Oppenheimer adiabatic picture,\nwhich instead is much reduced in a diabatic picture. Finally, the Born-Huang\nexpansion uncovers some synergistic vibronic states whose entanglement content\nis larger than that of any Born-Oppenheimer component in the superposition.",

In practical implementations, geometric\nasymmetry is typically employed.

In addition to exhibiting\na competitive transmittance sensitivity of ~5300%/RIU under single-wavelength\nconditions, the {\\epsilon}-qBIC design provides a substantially improved linear\nresponse. Specifically, the linear window area of its sensing data\ndistribution, calculated as the integrated wavelength region where the\nlinearity parameter remains above the preset threshold, is 104 times larger\nthan that of the geometry-asymmetric qBIC (g-qBIC), enabling more robust and\nreliable single-wavelength signal readout.

While the\nchemical space of SF chromophores is ever-expanding, the mechanistic details of\nelectronic-nuclear motions that dictate the photophysics are unclear. Rigid SF\ndimers with well-defined orientations are necessary to decipher such details.\nHere, using polarization-controlled white-light two-dimensional and pump-probe\nspectroscopies, we investigate a new class of contorted naphthalenediimide\ndimers, recently reported to have a favorable intramolecular SF (iSF) pathway.\n2D cross-peaks directly identify the two Davydov components of the dimer along\nwith strongly wavelength-dependent TT1 formation kinetics depending on which\nDavydov component is excited, implicating a coherently coupled intermediate\nthat mediates iSF. Enhanced quantum beats in the TT1 photoproduct suggest that\ninter-chromophore twisting and ruffling motions drive the ~200 fs evolution\ntowards an excimer-like intermediate and its subsequent ~2 ps relaxation to the\nTT1 photoproduct. Polarization anisotropy directly tracks electronic motion\nduring these steps and reveals surprisingly minimal electronic reorientation\nwith significant singlet-triplet mixing throughout the nuclear evolution away\nfrom the Franck-Condon geometry towards relaxed TT1. The combination of\nwhite-light 2DES and polarization anisotropy experiments presented here lends\npowerful insights for refinement of the existing theoretical models for iSF,\nand lays the foundation for a broader mechanistic investigation of iSF across\nvarious molecular platforms.",

The dendrites in biological neurons\nhave efficient information processing ability and computational power; however,\nthe neurons of SNNs rarely match the complex structure of the dendrites.\nInspired by the nonlinear structure and highly sparse properties of neuronal\ndendrites, in this study, we propose an efficient, lightweight SNN method with\nnonlinear pruning and dendritic integration (NSPDI-SNN). In this method, we\nintroduce nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) to improve the representation\nof the spatiotemporal information of neurons. We implement heterogeneous state\ntransition ratios of dendritic spines and construct a new and flexible\nnonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) method to achieve the high sparsity of SNN. We\nconducted systematic experiments on three benchmark datasets (DVS128 Gesture,\nCIFAR10-DVS, and CIFAR10) and extended the evaluation to two complex tasks\n(speech recognition and reinforcement learning-based maze navigation task).\nAcross all tasks, NSPDI-SNN consistently achieved high sparsity with minimal\nperformance degradation. In particular, our method achieved the best\nexperimental results on all three event stream datasets. Further analysis\nshowed that NSPDI significantly improved the efficiency of synaptic information\ntransfer as sparsity increased.

However, validating the reliability and performance of\nthe agent policies' behavior for deployment remains challenging. Most\nreinforcement learning policy testing methods produce test suites tailored to\nthe agent policy being tested, and their relevance to other policies is\nunclear. This work presents Multi-Policy Test Case Selection (MPTCS), a novel\nautomated test suite selection method for RL environments, designed to extract\ntest cases generated by any policy testing framework based on their\nsolvability, diversity, and general difficulty. MPTCS uses a set of policies to\nselect a diverse collection of reusable policy-agnostic test cases that reveal\ntypical flaws in the agents' behavior. The set of policies selects test cases\nfrom a candidate pool, which can be generated by any policy testing method,\nbased on a difficulty score. We assess the effectiveness of the difficulty\nscore and how the method's effectiveness and cost depend on the number of\npolicies in the set. Additionally, a method for promoting diversity in the test\nsuite, a discretized general test case descriptor surface inspired by\nquality-diversity algorithms, is examined to determine how it covers the state\nspace and which policies it triggers to produce faulty behaviors.",

Popular informed approaches include graph-based\nsearches, such as A*, and sampling-based methods, such as Informed RRT*, which\nutilize informed set and anytime strategies to expedite path optimization\nincrementally. Informed sampling-based planners define informed sets as subsets\nof the problem domain based on the current best solution cost.

It stems from the interaction\nbetween the superfluid and normal components, mediated by the dynamics of\nquantized vortices that induce the exchange of momentum and energy. Despite the\ncomplexity of these interactions, their essential features can be effectively\ndescribed by the dissipative point vortex model, an extension of classical\nvortex dynamics that incorporates finite-temperature dissipation. Mutual\nfriction is parametrized by the longitudinal (dissipative) coefficient $\\alpha$\nand the transverse (reactive) coefficient $\\alpha'$. Accurate measurement of\nthese parameters provides critical insights into the microscopic mechanisms\ngoverning vortex motion and dissipation in quantum fluids, serving as a key\nbenchmark for theoretical models. In this work, we employ the dissipative point\nvortex model to study how fluctuations in the initial conditions influence the\ninference of $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha'$ from the time evolution of the vortex\ntrajectories. Using experimentally realistic parameters, we show that\nfluctuations can introduce significant biases in the extracted values of the\nmutual friction coefficients.

Conventional methods use a\nregression-based formulation to predict a single \"mode\" for occluded and\nout-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to\ncapture multiple possible explanations.

However,\nensuring that the extracted knowledge (ideally in a semi-automatic way)\nencapsulates sufficient semantic depth for system-level diagnostics is a\nchallenging task. In this paper, we propose a minimal format for knowledge\ngraphs that is semantically rich enough to facilitate the synthesis of\nmeaningful fault trees. Fault trees offer an intuitive and efficient means for\nsystematic failure analysis, enabling engineers to assess all potential failure\nmodes in a structured, hierarchical manner. The methodology is applied to the\nLycoming O-320 engine, showing that meaningful fault trees can be synthesized\nfrom only structural and functional knowledge of the system, defined by the\nproposed conceptual model.",

    "abstract": "Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such\nas target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex\ncompositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language\nunderstanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global\nalignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical\nmethods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting\neffectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the\nHierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)\nframework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive\nLearning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures\nhierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with\nglobal text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),\nwhich dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic\nconsistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional\nreasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,\ndestabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation\n(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM\nachieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text\nretrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot\ngeneralization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned\nbaselines.",

We investigate\nwhat features of the data generating process lead to this performance, and\nassess the relative importance of the three components of the proposed\nestimator. We have two recommendations.

    "abstract": "Extensive research demonstrates that many households eligible for\nmeans-tested benefits do not claim them, a phenomenon known as non-take-up.\nEmpirical studies frequently conceptualise non-take-up as a rational decision,\noccurring when the perceived net utility of claiming is negative.\nTheoretically, long-term factors can substantially impact this decision.\nDespite the potential relevance of longitudinal aspects, evidence on their\ninfluence remains limited.\n  This study addresses this gap by incorporating long-term factors in the\nanalysis of non-take-up behaviour relating to Unemployment Benefit II (UB II),\nGermany's basic means-tested welfare programme. Using data from the German\nPanel Study Labour Market and Social Security (PASS) from 2008 to 2020, linked\nwith administrative data from Germany's Federal Employment Agency (PASS-ADIAB),\nthis study reconstructs households' benefit receipt and income histories, even\nduring non-survey periods. This allows modelling benefit non-take-up for\neligible households using the duration and frequency of past benefit receipt.\nIn addition, the use of administrative data mitigates bias from self-reported\nbenefit receipt. Household eligibility for UB II is simulated using GETTSIM, an\nopen-source microsimulation model, applied to the PASS dataset for the first\ntime.\n  Findings indicate that long-term factors significantly influence the\nprobability of claiming UB II. Specifically, a longer history of benefit\nreceipt increases this probability, whereas higher income potential and\npositive income shocks reduce it. Including long-term factors substantially\naffects the estimated impact of traditionally used determinants of non-take-up,\nindicating a potential misspecification in existing models that neglect them.",

We collected a series of follow-up observations\nincluding high-spectral resolution observations with HARPS-N over a period of\nfive years. Our modelling shows that the K0V star hosts two transiting\nsub-Neptunes with Rb = 3.04 +/- 0.19 RE, Rc = 2.75 +/- 0.14 RE, Mb = 9.4 +/-\n1.8 ME, and Mc = 10.6 +/- 2.1 ME. The orbital periods of planets b and c are\n5.1 and 9.4 days, respectively, corresponding to instellations of 145 +/- 10\nand 65 +/- 4 FE. The bulk densities are 1.8 +/- 0.5 and 2.9 +/- 0.7 g cm-3,\nrespectively, suggesting a volatile-rich interior composition. We computed a\nset of planet interior structure models. Planet b presents a high-metallicity\nenvelope that can accommodate up to 2.5 % in H/He in mass, while planet c\ncannot have more than 0.2 % as H/He in mass. For any composition of the core\nconsidered (Fe-rock or ice-rock), both planets would require a volatile-rich\nenvelope. In addition to the two planets, the radial velocity (RV) data clearly\nreveal a third signal, likely coming from a non-transiting planet, with an\norbital period of 7.6 +1.6 -2.4 years and a radial velocity semi-amplitude of\n35+3-5 m s-1. Our best fit model finds a minimum mass of 2.1 +/- 0.3 MJ and an\neccentricity of 0.25+0.08-0.11. However, several RV activity indicators also\nshow strong signals at similar periods, suggesting this signal might (partly)\noriginate from stellar activity. More data over a longer period of time are\nneeded to conclusively determine the nature of this signal. If it is confirmed\nas a triple-planet system, TOI-1438 would be one of the few detected systems to\ndate characterised by an architecture with two small, short-period planets and\none massive, long-period planet, where the inner and outer systems are\nseparated by an orbital period ratio of the order of a few hundred.",

Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the role of\nreconnection in the two-dimensional MRTI dynamics, using high-resolution\nsimulations. We establish that reconnection, through facilitating plume merger,\nrelieving magnetic tension, and enabling continued instability growth, forms an\nessential component for the long-term instability evolution. To quantify the\nrole of reconnection in energy dynamics, we develop a robust automated\nreconnection detection algorithm and perform a statistical analysis across a\nrange of magnetic field strengths. We find that reconnection accounts for up to\n$80\\%$ of the magnetic-to-kinetic energy transfer in the weak magnetic field\nregime, while contributing minimally ($\\approx 3\\%$) to magnetic energy\ndissipation.

Superiority of AGMMNs over GMMNs, as well as\ntypical parametric copula models, is demonstrated in terms of three\napplications.

On an example RVE problem, the MOR scheme accelerates computations\nby more than two orders of magnitude with little training data and negligible\nloss of accuracy. Additionally, the algorithm Pareto-dominates alternative\napproaches in the trade-off between accuracy and runtime on the considered\nexample.",

Using density functional theory, we\ndemonstrate the extent to which the mechanical and electronic properties of a\nhybrid system can be altered by the chemical modification of a given\nchromophore. The three systems exhibit distinct differences due to their\nchemical composition and van der Waals contact enabled by their geometry. All\nsystems are structurally stable. The binding energies follow the order\nPD$>$P$>$PO due to the large $\\pi$-system (PD) and strong structural distortion\n(PO). Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio exhibit pronounced anisotropy in all\ncases. PO exhibits the greatest anisotropy due to steric effects and a\npermanent dipole, which introduce directionality to the molecule-surface\ninteraction. Physisorption is accompanied by net charge transfer in the same\norder as the binding energies. The associated interfacial polarization results\nin a change in the work function compared to pristine MoS$_2$ in the order\nP$>$PO$>$PD. Finally, the presence of organic molecules introduces states into\nthe MoS$_2$ energy gap, with the band alignment being either type II (P, PO) or\ntype I (PD).",

The constant angular velocity problem was\noriginally studied by Moffatt (1977) and Pukhnachev (1977). Surface tension is\nneglected. The evolution equation for the film thickness is solved numerically\nfor a range of oscillation amplitudes and frequency. A blow-up map charted in\namplitude-frequency space reveals highly intricate fractal-like structures\nexhibiting self-similarity. For a general initial condition the film surface\nreaches a slope singularity at a finite time and tends to overturn. The\nhigh-frequency and low-frequency limits are examined asymptotically using a\nmultiple-scales approach. At high frequency the analysis suggests that an\nappropriate choice of initial profile can substantially delay the overturning\ntime, and even yield a time-periodic solution. In the low-frequency limit it is\npossible to construct a quasi-periodic solution that does not overturn if the\noscillation amplitude lies below a threshold value. Above this value the\nsolution tends inexorably toward blow-up. It is shown how solutions exhibiting\neither a single-shock or a double-shock may be constructed in common with the\nsteadily rotating cylinder problem.",

Log analysis, a core element of AIOps, provides\ncritical insights into complex behaviors and failures. This dissertation\nintroduces a three-layered architecture to support DevOps in failure\nresolution. The first layer, Log Investigation, performs autonomous log\nlabeling and anomaly classification. We propose a method that labels log data\nwithout manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of\nanomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies\ninto three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,\nAnomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a\nflexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,\nand supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show\nF1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third\nlayer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,\ntheir origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying\nkey services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of\nroot cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable\ninsights for mitigation. Our research addresses how log analysis methods can be\ndesigned and optimized to help DevOps resolve failures efficiently.

While such explanations may\nhelp diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail\nto capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on\ncounterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an\n\\ltlf formula $\\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual\nscenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that\ncomply with $\\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of\ncounterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that\nmust satisfy $\\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of\ngenerating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are\nallowed on $P$.

However, their performance degrades sharply on harder\ninstances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental\narchitectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation\nthrough the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local\nconnectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random\nk-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature\ndecreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based\nSAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range\ndependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.\nWe validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm\nthat curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used\nto predict performance.

This ensures that at least two complete cycles of emission can be\nobserved within the 10-year mission of LSST. To construct mock optical light\ncurves, we first calculate the MBHB average magnitudes in each LSST filter by\nconstructing a self-consistent SED that accounts for the binary accretion\nhistory and the emission from a circumbinary disc and mini-discs. We then add\nvariability modulations by using six 3D hydrodynamic simulations of accreting\nMBHBs with different eccentricities and mass ratios as templates. To make the\nlight curves realistic, we mimic the LSST observation patterns and cadence, and\nwe include stochastic variability and LSST photometric errors. Our results show\nfrom $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-1}$ MBHBs per square degree, with light curves that are\npotentially detectable by LSST. These systems are mainly low-redshift\n($z\\lesssim1.5$), massive ($\\gtrsim10^{7}\\, M_{\\odot}$), equal-mass (${\\sim}\n0.8$), relatively eccentric (${\\sim}0.6$), and with modulation periods of\naround $3.5$ years. Using periodogram analysis, we find that LSST variability\nstudies have a higher success rate ($>$50%) for systems with high\neccentricities ($e>$0.6). Additionally, at fixed eccentricity, detections tend\nto favour systems with more unequal mass ratios. The false alarm probability\nshows similar trends. Circular binaries systematically feature high values\n($\\gtrsim 10^{-1}$). Eccentric systems have low-FAP tails, down to\n$\\sim10^{-8}$.",

The validity of these associations is strongly\nsupported by our multi-wavelength flux model, which confirms that 15 of the 17\ncandidates are statistically consistent with the known blazar population,\nfalling within the $2\\sigma$ confidence interval.

    "abstract": "Imitation learning enables intelligent systems to acquire complex behaviors\nwith minimal supervision. However, existing methods often focus on\nshort-horizon skills, require large datasets, and struggle to solve\nlong-horizon tasks or generalize across task variations and distribution\nshifts. We propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework that jointly learns\ncontinuous control policies and symbolic domain abstractions from a few skill\ndemonstrations. Our method abstracts high-level task structures into a graph,\ndiscovers symbolic rules via an Answer Set Programming solver, and trains\nlow-level controllers using diffusion policy imitation learning. A high-level\noracle filters task-relevant information to focus each controller on a minimal\nobservation and action space. Our graph-based neuro-symbolic framework enables\ncapturing complex state transitions, including non-spatial and temporal\nrelations, that data-driven learning or clustering techniques often fail to\ndiscover in limited demonstration datasets. We validate our approach in six\ndomains that involve four robotic arms, Stacking, Kitchen, Assembly, and Towers\nof Hanoi environments, and a distinct Automated Forklift domain with two\nenvironments. The results demonstrate high data efficiency with as few as five\nskill demonstrations, strong zero- and few-shot generalizations, and\ninterpretable decision making.",

However, they remain vulnerable to\nhallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.\nPrevious video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They\nattribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing\nframes, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these\ncauses indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still\noversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect\noutputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of\nhallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during\nthe process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic\ngroups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to\nincreased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to\nseparate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.\nTo address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark\ndedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of\nSAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases\nwith semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to\nSAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to\nmitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to\nalleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability\nto distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a\ndataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both\nELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.",

    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve\nexploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been\npopularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far\nthe focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,\ninstead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions\nunderlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold\nposterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,\nperformance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To\nidentify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on\nthe likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically\nstudy prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common\nGaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing\nmore suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian\nreinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions\nfor better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian\nalgorithms.",

The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics,\nrooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest\nin applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges.\nHere, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from\nbiological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We\nevaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological\nchallenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior\nknowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved\nvariable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification.\nUpon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic\nregression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight\nthe emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable\ninnovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency\nof such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all\nchallenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from\nhybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based\nmechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative\nand knowledge integration capacities of deep learning.

Traditional onboarding methods\noften rely on centralized Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) models and\nmanufacturer-controlled keys, which introduce security risks and limit the\nuser's digital sovereignty. These limitations hinder the widespread deployment\nof scalable IoT solutions. This paper presents a novel onboarding framework\nthat builds upon existing network-layer onboarding techniques and extends them\nto the application layer to address these challenges. By integrating consortium\nblockchain technology, we propose a decentralized onboarding mechanism that\nenhances transparency, security, and monitoring for smart home architectures.\nThe architecture supports device registration, key revocation, access control\nmanagement, and risk detection through event-driven alerts across dedicated\nblockchain channels and smart contracts. To evaluate the framework, we formally\nmodel the protocol using the Tamarin Prover under the Dolev-Yao adversary\nmodel. The analysis focuses on authentication, token integrity, key\nconfidentiality, and resilience over public channels. A prototype\nimplementation demonstrates the system's viability in smart home settings, with\nverification completing in 0.34 seconds, highlighting its scalability and\nsuitability for constrained devices and diverse stakeholders.

Their binding energies are calculated to be about\n$0.1-33$ MeV, and this range depends on the free parameter of the theory. Our\nresearch contributes to the spectroscopic studies of hadronic molecular\npentaquark states.",

This paper explores MEV on the Polygon blockchain, with a particular\nfocus on Atomic Arbitrage (AA) transactions. We establish criteria for\nidentifying AA transactions and analyze key factors such as searcher behavior,\nbidding dynamics, and token usage. Utilizing a dataset spanning 22 months and\ncovering 23 million blocks, we examine MEV dynamics with a focus on Spam-based\nand Auction-based backrunning strategies. Our findings reveal that while\nSpam-based transactions are more prevalent, Auction-based transactions\ndemonstrate greater profitability. Through detailed examples and analysis, we\ninvestigate the interactions between network architecture, transaction\nsequencing, and MEV extraction, offering comprehensive insights into the\nevolution and challenges of MEV in decentralized ecosystems. These results\nemphasize the need for robust transaction ordering mechanisms and highlight the\nimplications of emerging MEV strategies for blockchain networks.",

    "abstract": "Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily\nrely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).\nHowever, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to\nmisclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can\nimprove the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive\naugmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce\nunnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection\nmodel. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but\nrather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper\nproposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the\ntarget regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing\nbackground interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more\ndirectly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby\nimproving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016\ndataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success\nrate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.",

However, most approaches either focus on a single\nfamily of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD\ndataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.\nMotivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate\nthat state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be\neffectively combined.

In\nearly-type galaxies, bulges and disks have similarly red and nearly uniform\ncolors. Disks become significantly bluer with increasing lateness of their\ntypes and bulges get slightly redder because of patchy dust. Disks have\nincreasingly blue colors with increasing radius, whereas dust extinction and\nscattering leads to smaller effective radii of the bulges and lower steepness\nof the best-fit S\\'ersic profiles in $g$ versus $i$. The impact is not uniform\nwith Hubble type and the bulges of intermediate-type spirals (Sb-Sc) have the\nreddest mean colors, the largest scatter in their colors, and show the largest\nmean and scatter in their color gradients. Disks of the intermediate-type\ngalaxies show the strongest color gradients. We interpret these properties of\nthe bulges and disks of intermediate-type spirals as being due to dust\nextinction and scattering which we hypothesize to be an indicator of the gas\ncontent and inflow of gas. if early-type galaxies do evolve from massive spiral\ngalaxies, typically intermediate-type spirals, these color gradients are signs\nof in-situ stellar growth within their bulges, likely driven by morphological\nstructure in their disk.

This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal\nFeature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,\nand the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC\nModule extract synergistic, common, and special information among different\nmodalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,\nimproving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among\ndifferent features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the\nFDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To\nvalidate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive\nexperiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results\ndemonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least\n1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing\nmulti-modal recommendation systems.

To alleviate them, we develop a novel\ncaptioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality\nthrough improved visual grounding.

Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the\nstates are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the\natoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not\nfull STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the\nactions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different\nversions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the\ntraces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all\nobservable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as\nthe atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,\nand the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not\nthe ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the\nlearning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,\nwhere certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions\nwhich can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The\nlearning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+\nstate-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,\nconstructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or\n``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground\nthe implicit action arguments in STRIPS+.

Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple\nprompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent\nunderlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of \"ideological depth\"\nin LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political\nrepresentations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the\n\"steerability\" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting\nand activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch\nbetween liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an\nincreased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.\nSecond, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse\nAutoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower\nsteerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our\nevaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than\nanother model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core\npolitical feature in an ideologically \"deep\" model, leading to consistent,\nlogical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same\nintervention in a \"shallow\" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.\nOur findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs\nand that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political\narchitecture.",

    "abstract": "Brain networks continually adjust the weights of their connections, resulting\nin heavy-tailed distributions of their connection weights, a few strong\nconnections among many weaker ones. At the same time, these connections undergo\nstructural plasticity, forming a complex network topology. Although mechanisms\nproducing either heavy-tailed distributions or complex topologies have been\nproposed, it has remained unclear whether a single mechanism can produce both.\nWe consider homeostasis as the driving principle and propose a Hebbian inspired\nmodel that adaptively adjusts weights and rewires directed connections based on\nhomeostatic dynamics. Without adaptive rewiring, weight adjustment alone still\ngenerates heavy-tailed weight distributions, as long as activity does not\nspread beyond locally neighboring units. However, when combined with adaptive\nrewiring, the homeostatic dynamics create a synergy that produces heavy-tailed\nweight distributions also for more extended activity flow. Furthermore, the\nmodel generates complex network structures that encompass convergent-divergent\ncircuits similar to those that facilitate signal transmission throughout the\nnervous system. By combining adaptive weight adjustment and rewiring based on\nthe same homeostatic dynamics, our model provides a parsimonious and robust\nmechanism that simultaneously produces heavy-tailed weight distributions and\nconvergent-divergent units under a wide range of dynamical regimes.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected\ncumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an\nagent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the\nperformance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying\nthe agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the\nperformance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing\nthe long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.\nIn this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard\nensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term\nperformance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator\nfor the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative\nreward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.\nTo address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified\ngeometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an\nestimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a\nregularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the\npolicy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We\nevaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms\nconventional RL methods.",

Forgetting has many\nfacets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a\nconditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing\nforgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable\nelimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to\nfocus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic\nprogramming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief\nrevision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical\ndeduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we\ntake an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic\nstates with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional\nlogic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic\nbackground means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to\nthe epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and\ninstantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking\nfunctions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic\nprogramming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating\nforgetting operations.

This deanonymization attack incurs zero transaction fee.\nWe mathematically model and analyze the attack method, perform large-scale\nmeasurements of blockchain ledgers, and conduct real-world attacks to validate\nthe attack.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the distributed minimax optimization problem over\nnetworks. To enhance convergence performance, we propose a distributed\noptimistic gradient tracking method, termed DOGT, which solves a surrogate\nfunction that captures the similarity between local objective functions to\napproximate a centralized optimistic approach locally. Leveraging a\nLyapunov-based analysis, we prove that DOGT achieves linear convergence to the\noptimal solution for strongly convex-strongly concave objective functions while\nremaining robust to the heterogeneity among them. Moreover, by integrating an\naccelerated consensus protocol, the accelerated DOGT (ADOGT) algorithm achieves\nan optimal convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O} \\left( \\kappa \\log \\left( \\epsilon\n^{-1} \\right) \\right)$ and communication complexity of $\\mathcal{O} \\left(\n\\kappa \\log \\left( \\epsilon ^{-1} \\right) /\\sqrt{1-\\sqrt{\\rho _W}} \\right)$ for\na suboptimality level of $\\epsilon>0$, where $\\kappa$ is the condition number\nof the objective function and $\\rho_W$ is the spectrum gap of the network.\nNumerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only\nindicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular\nguidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient\nlearning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient\nsolutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To\naddress this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task\ndifficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided\nExploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to\ndynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task\ndifficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal\nto modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is\nstruggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for\neasier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.\nExperiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show\nthat DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models\nnot only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance\nwhen scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters\neffective exploration without sacrificing precision.",

Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a\nmodel to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.\nHowever, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset\nis fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an\nunsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels\n(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling\nincremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels\ninto various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate\nperformance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our\napproach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)\nmethods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to\nfine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure\nits computational complexity to validate its suitability for\nresource-constrained environments.

Despite their widespread success, LLMs heavily\nrely on external code dependencies from package management systems, creating a\ncomplex and interconnected LLM dependency supply chain. Vulnerabilities in\ndependencies can expose LLMs to security risks. While existing research\npredominantly focuses on model-level security threats, vulnerabilities within\nthe LLM dependency supply chain have been overlooked. To fill this gap, we\nconducted an empirical analysis of 52 open-source LLMs, examining their\nthird-party dependencies and associated vulnerabilities. We then explored\nactivities within the LLM repositories to understand how maintainers manage\nthird-party vulnerabilities in practice. Finally, we compared third-party\ndependency vulnerabilities in the LLM ecosystem to those in the Python\necosystem. Our results show that half of the vulnerabilities in the LLM\necosystem remain undisclosed for more than 56.2 months, significantly longer\nthan those in the Python ecosystem. Additionally, 75.8% of LLMs include\nvulnerable dependencies in their configuration files. This study advances the\nunderstanding of LLM supply chain risks, provides insights for practitioners,\nand highlights potential directions for improving the security of the LLM\nsupply chain.",

We use X-ray data from $Chandra$ to extract the hot gas emission from\n78 of the most luminous infrared-selected galaxies in the local Universe. In\nthe extreme star-forming environments, the intrinsic thermal X-ray luminosity\nof hot gas ($L_{\\rm 0.5 - 2\\,keV}^{\\rm gas}$) shows a significant excess over\nthe predictions of the standard linear $L_{\\rm X}$$-$SFR relation for most\nobjects with very high star formation rates (SFRs). The contribution of active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) appears to have little impact on the global hot gas\nluminosity. For galaxies with SFR $\\gt$ 50 ${M_{\\rm \\odot}}\\,\\,{\\rm yr^{-1}}$,\nthe Bayesian analysis gives a super-linear relation of ${\\rm log}(L_{\\rm\n0.5-2\\,keV}^{\\rm gas} /{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}})=1.34\\,{\\rm log}({\\rm SFR}/{M_{\\rm\n\\odot}}\\,{\\rm yr^{-1}})+39.82$, similar to that found in the central regions of\nnormal spiral galaxies. These results suggest a scenario in which the merger of\ngalaxies delivers substantial amounts of gas, triggering intense star formation\nin both the nuclear region and the galactic disk, and ultimately enhancing the\nglobal thermal X-ray emission. The ratio of the apparent thermal luminosity in\nthe 0.5$-$2 keV band ($L_{\\rm 0.5 - 2\\,keV}^{\\rm appar}$) to $L_{\\rm 0.5 -\n2\\,keV}^{\\rm gas}$ shows statistically significant negative correlations with\nthe intrinsic column density ($N_{\\rm H}$) and SFR. Moreover, in contrast to\nthe luminosity ratio, SFR shows a moderate positive correlation with intrinsic\n$N_{\\rm H}$. This suggests that the correlation between $L_{\\rm 0.5 -\n2\\,keV}^{\\rm appar}$/$L_{\\rm 0.5 - 2\\,keV}^{\\rm gas}$ and SFR may be driven by\nthe underlying $L_{\\rm 0.5 - 2\\,keV}^{\\rm appar}$/$L_{\\rm 0.5 - 2\\,keV}^{\\rm\ngas}$$-$$N_{\\rm H}$ and SFR$-$$N_{\\rm H}$ relations.",

Risks are also inherently related to compliance with the new\nlegislation. Objective: The paper investigates how risks are framed in the EU's\nfive core cyber security legislative acts, whether the framings indicate\nconvergence or divergence between the acts and their risk concepts, and what\nqualifying words and terms are used when describing the legal notions of risks.\nMethod : The paper's methodology is based on qualitative legal interpretation\nand taxonomy-building. Results: The five acts have an encompassing coverage of\ndifferent cyber security risks, including but not limited to risks related to\ntechnical, organizational, and human security as well as those not originating\nfrom man-made actions. Both technical aspects and assets are used to frame the\nlegal risk notions in many of the legislative acts. A threat-centric viewpoint\nis also present in one of the acts. Notable gaps are related to acceptable\nrisks, non-probabilistic risks, and residual risks. Conclusion: The EU's new\ncyber security legislation has significantly extended the risk-based approach\nto regulations. At the same time, complexity and compliance burden have\nincreased. With this point in mind, the paper concludes with a few practical\ntakeaways about means to deal with compliance and research it.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of\nnormality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can\ncontribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether\nthe human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which\nlargely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.",

Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable\npolicy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse\nrequirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user\ninstructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to\ndrive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy\ncode generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to\nunveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled\nrobotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation\ntask and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive\nexperiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in\ntwo prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable\nbehaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed\ncharacterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight\nfor practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a\nrefinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the\nreliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic\nmanipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.",

With coded communications,\ninterestingly, all waveforms offer nearly the same BER when the VSSD receiver\nis employed. Hence, we conclude that when the receiver complexity is\nconstrained, waveform choice matters, especially under harsh channel\nconditions, whereas with more sophisticated receiver algorithms, these\ndifferences disappear.",

However, the high cost and\ntime-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of\nlarge-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of\nadvanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address\nthis critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework\nfor generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D\nfingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D\nstyle transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale\nimages mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D\nStructure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D\nanatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that\nrenders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other\nimaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale\nsynthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the\nhigh quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition\nperformance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and\nfine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable\nreduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD\nbenchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data\nscarcity.",

Our analysis spans five\nsurvey rounds covering two cohorts of children tracked from early childhood to\nyoung adulthood. Results indicate strong persistence in household economic\nstatus, highlighting limited intergenerational mobility. Education, proxied by\nItem Response Theory-based mathematics scores, consistently emerges as the most\nrobust predictor of future economic well-being, particularly in the younger\ncohort. In contrast, self-reported childhood health shows limited direct impact\non either education or later wealth, though it is influenced by household\neconomic conditions. These findings underscore the foundational role of wealth\nand the growing importance of cognitive achievement in shaping life\ntrajectories.

    "abstract": "The overwhelming majority of CVs have orbital periods shorter than 10 hr.\nHowever, a few have much longer periods, and their formation and existence pose\nchallenges for the CV evolution models. These extremely long-period CVs must\nhost nuclearly evolved donor stars, as otherwise, the companion of the white\ndwarf would be too small to fill its Roche lobe. This makes them natural\nlaboratories for testing binary evolution models and accretion processes with\nsubgiant donors. To shed light on the formation and evolution of accreting\ncompact objects with subgiant companions, we investigated two extremely\nlong-period CVs in detail, namely V479 And and V1082 Sgr. We searched for\nreasonable formation pathways to explain their refined stellar and binary\nparameters. We used a broad set of new observations, including ultraviolet and\ninfrared spectroscopy, results of circular polarimetry, and improved Gaia\ndistance estimates to determine fundamental parameters to be confronted with\nnumerical simulations. Furthermore, we utilized the MESA code to conduct\nnumerical simulations, employing state-of-the-art prescriptions, such as the\nCARB model for strong magnetic braking. Both systems have unusual chemical\ncompositions and very low masses for their assigned spectral classes. This most\nlikely indicates that they underwent thermal timescale mass transfer. We found\nmodels for both that can reasonably reproduce their properties. We conclude\nthat the donor stars in both V479 And and V1082 Sgr are filling their Roche\nlobes. Our findings suggest that orbital angular momentum loss is stronger due\nto magnetic braking in CVs with subgiant donors compared to those with\nunevolved donors. In addition, our findings suggest that extremely long-period\nCVs could significantly contribute to the population of double white dwarf\nbinaries in close orbits.",

    "abstract": "In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms\noften struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One\nkey insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that\nwide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)\npromote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in\ninput data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more\nsensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the\ninherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient\ndescent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in\nwhich curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy\nTailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects\nheavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to\nenhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as\nsharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss\nlandscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide\nbasins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise\ninto an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD\nconsistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like\nMNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It\nultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves\ngeneralization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning\nrate choices.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation is fundamental to human societies. While several basic\ntheoretical mechanisms underlying its evolution have been established, research\naddressing more realistic settings remains underdeveloped. Drawing on the\nhypothesis that intensified environmental fluctuations drove early behavioral\nevolution in humans during the Middle Stone Age in Africa, we examine the\neffects of environmental variability and human mobility on the evolution of\ncooperation. In our model, the variability is represented by randomly moving\nresource-rich spots across a two-dimensional space, and the mobility is\nrepresented by resource-seeking migration of agents. These agents interact\ncooperatively or competitively for resources while adopting behavioral\nstrategies from more successful neighbors. Through extensive simulations of\nthis model, we reveal three key findings: (i) with sufficient agent mobility,\neven modest environmental variability promotes cooperation, but further\nvariability does not enhance cooperation; (ii) with any level of environmental\nvariability, agent mobility promotes cooperation; and (iii) these effects occur\nbecause the joint effect of environmental variability and agent mobility\ndisrupts defector groups in resource-rich areas, forming cooperator groups on\nthose sites. Although previous studies examine environmental variability and\nmobility separately, to our knowledge this is the first study to analyze their\njoint effects on the evolution of cooperation. These findings suggest that\nenvironmental variability can promote cooperative group formation without\nenhanced cognitive abilities, providing new insights into the evolution of\nhuman cooperation and, by extension, sociality.",

Unlike prior works on spatially reconfigurable FAS, which\nadjust element positions, ER-FAS provides direct control over each element's EM\ncharacteristics to realize on-demand beam-pattern shaping. While existing\nstudies have exploited ER-FAS to boost spectral efficiency, this paper explores\nits application for downlink localization. We consider a multiple-input\nsingle-output (MISO) system in which a multi-antenna ER-FAS at the base station\nserves a single-antenna user equipment (UE). We consider two reconfigurability\nparadigms: (i) a synthesis model where each antenna generates desired\nbeampatterns from a finite set of EM basis functions, and (ii) a finite-state\nselection model in which each antenna selects a pattern from a predefined set\nof patterns. For both paradigms, we formulate the joint baseband (BB) and EM\nprecoder design to minimize the UE position error bound. In the synthesis case\nwe derive low-dimensional closed-form expressions for both the BB and EM\nprecoders. For the finite-state model we obtain closed-form BB structures and\npropose a low-complexity block-coordinate-descent algorithm for EM pattern\nselection.

This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary\nregularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of\nindividual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first\nstrategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent\nstudies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages\nextreme anisotropy-specifically, \"needle-like\" shapes-by favoring more\nbalanced, \"disk-like\" forms that are better suited for stable surface\nreconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance\nFunction (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an\nEikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous\nglobal surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the\nunderlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity\nof individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior.

Unlike single-threshold approaches that apply one cutoff across all\ngroups, our group-aware method optimizes the Pareto frontier between balanced\naccuracy and worst-group balanced accuracy, enabling fine-grained control over\ngroup-level performance. Critically, we find that applying group thresholds to\nsynthetically augmented data yields minimal additional benefit, suggesting\nthese approaches are fundamentally redundant.

    "abstract": "Atom interferometry is a natural laboratory for precision tests of general\nrelativity, but there is no simple relationship between atom interferometer\nphase and geometric properties of spacetime.

    "abstract": "Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series\ngeneration. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over\nextended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task\nof generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series\nexhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also\nundergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term\ndependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the\nother hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships\nbetween different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing\nboth intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important\nchallenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative\nmodel for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through\nstage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model\npreserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data\ndistribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence\ndecomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different\ntime scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel\nfusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent\nmodeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,\neffectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of\nlong-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets\nvalidate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation\ntasks.",

Our results offer a trade-off between the approximation ratio\nand running time, which can take advantage of additional structure in the\npolynomial, such as non-negativity or sparsity of the coefficients.\n  - We study the problem of approximating the $p \\to q$-norm of a matrix $A$,\nand prove the first NP-hardness result for approximating norms in the\nhypercontractive case $1< p < q < \\infty$.

At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$\nglobally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward\nstandard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch.

    "abstract": "According to classical Miedema theory, reducing crystals to the order of\nnanometer sizes might greatly modulate the mixing enthalpy of elements, thus\nenabling the invention of a lot of new bulk-immiscible alloys. Although\nnumerous alloys with higher mixing enthalpies remain unexplored, this strategy\nis approaching its limit, as reflected by the critical diameter of recent\nalloys of 1.8 nm, which corresponds to ~150 atoms and hardly provides a\ncrystalline order. Future development requires not only even smaller\natomic-scale control but also a new surface energy-saving mechanism. Here, we\nreport the formation of W-Cu nanoalloys with a very large miscibility gap in\nthe bulk via the use of an atomically size-selected cluster beam source as an\nexample. The face-centered cubic (FCC) structure was demonstrated through\nelectron diffraction, which indicated a lattice constant of 3.88{\\AA} for\nW0.85Cu0.15 nanoalloys (~2280 atoms). In this comprehensive study that covers a\nlarge parameter space of W/Cu compositions and numbers of atoms, an asymmetric\nmiscibility nanophase diagram in which W-rich compositions favor mixing and the\ncritical size is approximately 6000 atoms, which far exceeds the approximately\ntens of atoms predicted via classical theory, was obtained for the first time.\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a mutual strain-induced\nmechanism that simultaneously lowers the surface energies while reducing the\nsize to the atomic scale. This approach paves the way for the development of\nnew high-performance nonequilibrium phase alloys.",

Recent research has predominantly focused on\neither developing cloud-based personalized LLMs or exploring the on-device\ndeployment of general-purpose LLMs. However, few studies have addressed both\nlimitations simultaneously by investigating personalized on-device language\nmodels. To bridge this gap, we propose CDCDA-PLM, a framework for deploying\npersonalized on-device language models on user devices with support from a\npowerful cloud-based LLM. Specifically, CDCDA-PLM leverages the server-side\nLLM's strong generalization capabilities to augment users' limited personal\ndata, mitigating the issue of data scarcity. Using both real and synthetic\ndata, A personalized on-device language models (LMs) is fine-tuned via\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules and deployed on users' local\ndevices, enabling them to process queries without depending on cloud-based\nLLMs. This approach eliminates reliance on network stability and ensures high\nresponse speeds.

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and\nefficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and\ndistillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the\nprefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we\nintroduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in\nthe prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token\nsequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with\nminimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\nconsistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD\nunified settings without disaggregation. Under the default settings, our method\nachieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data\ntransmission bandwidth consumption.",

In this system,\nexcess valence electrons from Y deconfine from the cation framework to form an\ninterstitial anionic electron lattice that constitutes the dice lattice. Our\nARPES measurements unambiguously identify two sets of dice-lattice bands in\nYCl, including a nearly dispersionless band at the Fermi level. The flat bands\nand other dispersive bands observed in ARPES find excellent agreement with\nfirst-principles calculations, and theoretical analysis reveals that the\nnear-$E_F$ electronic structure is well captured by a simple dice-lattice\nmodel. Our findings thus end the long quest of a real dice flat band material\nand establish vdW electride YCl as a prototype of dice metals.

The hypothesis that seamounts are\nthe ``stirring rods'' of the ocean has motivated considerable recent interest\nin turbulent flow features near 3D topography.

Complex interactions occur between the\ntopography, the near wake, and previously shed vortices, especially during the\ntidal phases when the flow direction is reversed. The topographic wake is shown\nto be a hotspot for mixing, featuring large dissipation rates in the attached\nshear layers, hydraulic jet, recirculation region in the near wake, and\nperipheries of shed vortices. The majority of the observed dissipation is due\nto the vertical shear. Over a tidal cycle, the volume-integrated local\ndissipation within the wake is at least four times greater than the internal\nwave flux that may be dissipated elsewhere. Furthermore, normalized dissipation\nrates are maximized for the purely tidal setting.

    "abstract": "Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target\nprogram states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes,\nconfirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential\nvulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are\noften deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by\nnumerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches\nrely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search;\nhowever, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize\nprogress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified\nconstraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to\ngeneralize to diverse target states and programs.\n  We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed\nfuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing\nprogress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones\ntowards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under\nfuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while\nproviding additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to\ndiverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis\ntools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while\nensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false\nrejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus\nsubstantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in\ndiscovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x.\nSo far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already\nacknowledged with a draft patch.",

To do this, the existing communities on this\nsubject on Twitter and TikTok have been analyzed with Social Network Analysis\ntechniques, in addition to the presence of young people in them. The results\nindicate that the debates between both networks are not very cohesive, with a\nhighly modularized structure that suggests isolation of each community. For\nthis reason, it may be considered that the debate on sexual identity has\nresulted in a strong polarization of feminist activism in social media.\nLikewise, the positions of transinclusive feminism are very much in the\nmajority among young people; this reinforces the idea of an ideological debate\nthat can also be understood from a generational perspective. Finally,\ndifferential use between both social networks has been identified, where TikTok\nis a less partisan and more dialogue-based network than Twitter, which leads to\ndiscussions and participation in a more neutral tone.",

    "abstract": "LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face\nchallenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive\ninformation. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the\nmodel after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs\nprohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine\nunlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove\nsensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.\nRecently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by\nintegrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information\nto identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA\nadapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires\naccess to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental\nassumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in\nimportance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel\nunlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in\nFILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget\nset. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling\nparameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method\nachieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed\ncompared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks\nincluding TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE.

    "abstract": "Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring\nnew knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what\nhas been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from\nprevious tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to\nprotect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data\nprivacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are\ndissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding\nGenerative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired\nby the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the \"wake\" phase, the system rapidly\nlearns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,\nG-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the \"sleep\" phase, the system\nenters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data\n(\"dreams\") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor\nvia knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw\ndata, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant\nadvantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer\nvision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)\nbenchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results\ndemonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and\nmaintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's\neffectiveness and domain-generality.",

Electronic\ncorrelation renormalizes the bands around the Fermi level and modifies the\nenergy and location of Weyl points, and the resulting FAs. In particular, on\nthe Co-terminated surface, the FAs are formed by connecting Weyl points located\nin adjacent Brillouin zones in DFT+DMFT calculations and experiments, in strong\ncontrast to the FAs connecting Weyl points within the same Brillouin zone in\nDFT calculations.

Firm heterogeneity leads to a sorting pattern, whereby more\nproductive firms are more likely to invest abroad.

This NP-complete problem is central to\ndomains such as biological network analysis, social network mining, and quantum\ncircuit optimization. Traditional approaches rely on backtracking algorithms\nlike VF2, which suffer from sequential bottlenecks that limit their ability to\nexploit modern parallel hardware. In this work, we introduce $\\Delta$-Motif, a\nGPU-accelerated subgraph isomorphism algorithm that reformulates the task\nthrough the lens of database operations.

By leveraging mature,\noptimized libraries from the NVIDIA RAPIDS ecosystem and Pandas framework, our\nsolution achieves massive parallelism while remaining portable across systems\nsupporting standard relational primitives.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a communication-efficient distributed machine\nlearning method that allows multiple devices to collaboratively train models\nwithout sharing raw data. FL can be categorized into centralized and\ndecentralized paradigms. The centralized paradigm relies on a central server to\naggregate local models, potentially resulting in single points of failure,\ncommunication bottlenecks, and exposure of model parameters. In contrast, the\ndecentralized paradigm, which does not require a central server, provides\nimproved robustness and privacy. The essence of federated learning lies in\nleveraging multiple local updates for efficient communication. However, this\napproach may result in slower convergence or even convergence to suboptimal\nmodels in the presence of heterogeneous and imbalanced data. To address this\nchallenge, we study decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW),\nwhich replaces multiple local update steps on a single device with random walk\nupdates. Traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and its decentralized\nversions commonly ignore stragglers, which reduces the amount of training data\nand introduces sampling bias. Therefore, we allow DFedRW to aggregate partial\nrandom walk updates, ensuring that each computation contributes to the model\nupdate. To further improve communication efficiency, we also propose a\nquantized version of DFedRW. We demonstrate that (quantized) DFedRW achieves\nconvergence upper bound of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{k^{1-q}})$ under convex\nconditions. Furthermore, we propose a sufficient condition that reveals when\nquantization balances communication and convergence. Numerical analysis\nindicates that our proposed algorithms outperform (decentralized) FedAvg in\nboth convergence rate and accuracy, achieving a 38.3\\% and 37.5\\% increase in\ntest accuracy under high levels of heterogeneities.",

In particular, phonological dyslexia causes\nproblems in connecting the sounds of words with their written forms.\nConsequently, affected individuals may encounter issues such as slow reading\nspeed, inaccurate reading, and difficulty decoding unfamiliar words. To address\nthese complexities, the use of compensatory tools and strategies is essential\nto ensure equitable opportunities for dyslexic students. However, the general\nunderestimation of the issue and lack of awareness regarding the significance\nof support methodologies pose significant obstacles. One of the ways to enhance\nconsciousness towards a certain issue is by stimulating empathy with whom is\naffected by it. In light of this, this study introduces a serious game in\nvirtual reality, targeted at educators, students, and, in general, at the\nnon-dyslexic community. The game seeks to enhance understanding of the\nchallenges that individuals with dyslexia experience daily, highlighting the\nrelevance of supportive measures. This approach encourages players to empathize\nwith the struggles of dyslexic individuals and to learn firsthand the\nimportance of supportive methodologies. The final version of the experience was\ntested by 101 participants and evaluated through a specific collection of\nquestionnaires validated in the literature.

    "abstract": "We present a fast and accurate formulation for computing the nonlinear matter\npower spectrum at one-loop order based on Unified Lagrangian Perturbation\nTheory (ULPT). ULPT decomposes the density field into the Jacobian deviation,\ncapturing intrinsic nonlinear growth, and the displacement-mapping factor,\naccounting for large-scale distortions due to bulk flows. This structural\nseparation leads to a natural division of the power spectrum into a source term\nand a displacement-mapping factor, ensuring infrared (IR) safety by\nconstruction. We implement an efficient numerical algorithm using FFTLog and\nFAST-PT, achieving approximately 2-second evaluations on a standard laptop. The\nresults are validated against simulation-based emulators, including the Dark\nEmulator and Euclid Emulator 2. Across 100 sampled cosmologies, ULPT agrees\nwith emulator predictions at the 2--3\\% level up to \\( k \\simeq\n0.4\\,h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} \\) for \\( z \\geq 0.5 \\), without any nuisance\nparameters. Similar agreement is found in configuration space, where the\ntwo-point correlation function remains accurate down to \\( r \\simeq\n10\\,h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc} \\). Compared to standard perturbation theory, which\nfails at small scales due to series expansion of the displacement factor, ULPT\nmaintains convergence by preserving its full exponential form. We also clarify\nthe mechanism of BAO damping: exponential suppression by displacement and peak\nsharpening by nonlinear growth. The combination accurately reproduces BAO\nfeatures seen in simulations. ULPT thus offers a robust, IR-safe, and\ncomputationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale structure in\ngalaxy surveys.

CALM is built\non the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm\nfoundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection.

Second, it introduces an\nLLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,\ncontext-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training\ndataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful\npattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark.

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the\nautomotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,\nefficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for\nsophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable\nand trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,\nprolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini\nAutonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of\nautonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and\ncost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of\nmachine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring\nonline training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology\nbased on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks\n(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the\nproposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures\ntrained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental\nfeatures. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time\nmetrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural\nmodifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization\ncapability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated\npromising results when compared with RNNs.",

    "abstract": "Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,\noverlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while\nlearning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by\nmeasuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while\nsequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects\nan instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates\nparameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The\nresulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and\nbias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.\n  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\\times$ Online/Batch) to\ndisentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize\nthe protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a\nheuristic \"oracle reference band\" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.\nBaseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods\n(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and\npretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in\nearly-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,\nwhile pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models\nremain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.\n  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements\nconventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing\nlearners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the\nfirst examples.",

    "abstract": "Community detection plays a central role in uncovering meso scale structures\nin networks. However, existing methods often suffer from disconnected or weakly\nconnected clusters, undermining interpretability and robustness. Well-Connected\nClusters (WCC) and Connectivity Modifier (CM) algorithms are post-processing\ntechniques that improve the accuracy of many clustering methods. However, they\nare computationally prohibitive on massive graphs. In this work, we present\noptimized parallel implementations of WCC and CM using the HPE Chapel\nprogramming language. First, we design fast and efficient parallel algorithms\nthat leverage Chapel's parallel constructs to achieve substantial performance\nimprovements and scalability on modern multicore architectures. Second, we\nintegrate this software into Arkouda/Arachne, an open-source, high-performance\nframework for large-scale graph analytics. Our implementations uniquely enable\nwell-connected community detection on massive graphs with more than 2 billion\nedges, providing a practical solution for connectivity-preserving clustering at\nweb scale. For example, our implementations of WCC and CM enable community\ndetection of the over 2-billion edge Open-Alex dataset in minutes using 128\ncores, a result infeasible to compute previously.",
