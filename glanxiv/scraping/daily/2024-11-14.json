    "abstract": "Foundational deep learning (DL) models are general models, trained on large,\ndiverse, and unlabelled datasets, typically using self-supervised learning\ntechniques have led to significant advancements especially in natural language\nprocessing. These pretrained models can be fine-tuned for related downstream\ntasks, offering faster development and reduced training costs, while often\nachieving improved performance. In this work, we introduce Masked Spectrogram\nModeling, a novel self-supervised learning approach for pretraining\nfoundational DL models on radio signals. Adopting a Convolutional LSTM\narchitecture for efficient spatio-temporal processing, we pretrain the model\nwith an unlabelled radio dataset collected from over-the-air measurements.\nSubsequently, the pretrained model is fine-tuned for two downstream tasks:\nspectrum forecasting and segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour methodology achieves competitive performance in both forecasting accuracy\nand segmentation, validating its effectiveness for developing foundational\nradio models.",

    "abstract": "Mutation testing was proposed to identify weaknesses in test suites by\nrepeatedly generating artificially faulty versions of the software (mutants)\nand determining if the test suite is sufficient to detect them (kill them).\nWhen the tests are insufficient, each surviving mutant provides an opportunity\nto improve the test suite. We conducted a study and found that many such\nsurviving mutants (up to 84% for the subjects of our study) are detectable by\nsimply augmenting existing tests with additional assertions, or assertion\namplification. Moreover, we find that many of these mutants are detectable by\nmultiple existing tests, giving developers options for how to detect them. To\nhelp with these challenges, we created a technique that performs memory-state\nanalysis to identify candidate assertions that developers can use to detect the\nsurviving mutants. Additionally, we build upon prior research that identifies\n``crossfiring'' opportunities -- tests that coincidentally kill multiple\nmutants. To this end, we developed a theoretical model that describes the\nvarying granularities that crossfiring can occur in the existing test suite,\nwhich provide opportunities and options for how to kill surviving mutants. We\noperationalize this model to an accompanying technique that optimizes the\nassertion amplification of the existing tests to crossfire multiple mutants\nwith fewer added assertions, optionally concentrated within fewer tests. Our\nexperiments show that we can kill all surviving mutants that are detectable\nwith existing test data with only 1.1% of the identified assertion candidates,\nand increasing by a factor of 6x, on average, the number of killed mutants from\namplified tests, over tests that do not crossfire.",

Historical\nweather and normalised difference vegetation index datasets of Australia for\n2005 - 2021 were utilised. Two main unsupervised approaches were analysed. The\nfirst used a deep autoencoder to obtain latent features, which were then fed\ninto clustering models, isolation forest, local outlier factor and one-class\nSVM for anomaly detection. The second approach used a deep autoencoder to\nreconstruct the input data and use reconstruction errors to identify anomalies.\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoders and fully connected (FC)\nautoencoders were employed in this part, both in an unsupervised way learning\nonly from nominal data. The FC autoencoder outperformed its counterparts,\nachieving an accuracy of 0.71, an F1-score of 0.74, and an MCC of 0.42.

During local training,\nfederation nodes periodically send their models back (i.e., rewind) to the\nnodes they received them from for a limited number of iterations. This strategy\nreduces the distribution shift between nodes' data, leading to enhanced\nlearning and generalization performance. We evaluate our method on multiple\nbenchmarks, demonstrating its superiority over standard decentralized federated\nlearning methods and those enforcing specific routing schemes within the\nfederation.

To simplify our discussion the binary choice problem is\nparticularly discussed where each agent only takes an alternative of two\nchoices.

A lack of an optimal control framework for the WTPS\n(i.e., no access to actual optimal control trajectories) reduces optimal\ncontrol design potential and prevents competing control methods of WTPSs to\nhave a reference control solution for comparison. In fact, the WTPS control\nliterature often relies on reduced and linearized models of WTPSs, and avoids\nthe nonsmoothness present in the system during transitions between different\nconditions of operation. In this paper, we introduce a novel optimal control\nframework for the WTPS control problem. We use in our formulation a recent\naccurate, nonlinear differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model of WTPSs, which\nwe then generalize over all wind speed ranges using non-smooth functions. We\nalso use developments in nonsmooth optimal control theory to take into account\nnonsmoothness present in the system. We implement this new WTPS optimal control\napproach to solve the problem numerically, including (i) different wind speed\nprofiles for testing the system response; (ii) real-world wind data; and (iii)\na comparison with smoothing and naive approaches.

Using $N$-body simulations with $\\texttt{TTVFast}$ and focusing on the\ndominant periodic signal in the TTVs, we chart out the landscape of these modes\nand provide analytic predictions for their locations and widths, providing the\ncommunity with a map for the first time.

We show how one can define appropriate orbital\nperiod priors for the perturbing planet in order to sufficiently sample the\ncomplete parameter space. We demonstrate, analytically, how one can explain the\nnumerical simulations using first-order near mean-motion resonance\nsuper-periods, the synodic period, and their aliases -- the expected dominant\nTTV periods in the low-eccentricity regime.

Previous research\nhas proposed frameworks for risk mitigation, but has left gaps in our\nunderstanding of the perceived effectiveness of measures for mitigating\nsystemic risks. Our study addresses this gap by evaluating how experts perceive\ndifferent mitigations that aim to reduce the systemic risks of general-purpose\nAI models. We surveyed 76 experts whose expertise spans AI safety; critical\ninfrastructure; democratic processes; chemical, biological, radiological, and\nnuclear risks (CBRN); and discrimination and bias. Among 27 mitigations\nidentified through a literature review, we find that a broad range of risk\nmitigation measures are perceived as effective in reducing various systemic\nrisks and technically feasible by domain experts. In particular, three\nmitigation measures stand out: safety incident reports and security information\nsharing, third-party pre-deployment model audits, and pre-deployment risk\nassessments. These measures show both the highest expert agreement ratings\n(>60\\%) across all four risk areas and are most frequently selected in experts'\npreferred combinations of measures (>40\\%). The surveyed experts highlighted\nthat external scrutiny, proactive evaluation and transparency are key\nprinciples for effective mitigation of systemic risks. We provide policy\nrecommendations for implementing the most promising measures, incorporating the\nqualitative contributions from experts.

This dissertation delves into the role of\ninductive biases -- particularly, continuous modeling and symmetry preservation\n-- as strategies to enhance the efficiency of Deep Learning. It is structured\nin two main parts.\n  The first part investigates continuous modeling as a tool to improve the\nefficiency of Deep Learning algorithms. Continuous modeling involves the idea\nof parameterizing neural operations in a continuous space. The research\npresented here demonstrates substantial benefits for the (i) computational\nefficiency -- in time and memory, (ii) the parameter efficiency, and (iii)\ndesign efficiency -- the complexity of designing neural architectures for new\ndatasets and tasks.\n  The second focuses on the role of symmetry preservation on Deep Learning\nefficiency. Symmetry preservation involves designing neural operations that\nalign with the inherent symmetries of data. The research presented in this part\nhighlights significant gains both in data and parameter efficiency through the\nuse of symmetry preservation. However, it also acknowledges a resulting\ntrade-off of increased computational costs.\n  The dissertation concludes with a critical evaluation of these findings,\nopenly discussing their limitations and proposing strategies to address them,\ninformed by literature and the author insights.

The jobs considered include a range of\noccupations, from those with a significant male presence to those with a\nnotable female concentration, as well as jobs with a relatively equal gender\ndistribution. Three different sentence processing methods were used to assess\npotential gender bias: masked tokens, unmasked sentences, and sentence\ncompletion. In addition, the LLMs suggested names of individuals in specific\noccupations, which were then examined for gender distribution. The results show\na positive correlation between the models' pronoun choices and the gender\ndistribution present in U.S. labor force data. Female pronouns were more often\nassociated with female-dominated occupations, while male pronouns were more\noften associated with male-dominated occupations. Sentence completion showed\nthe strongest correlation with actual gender distribution, while name\ngeneration resulted in a more balanced 'politically correct' gender\ndistribution, albeit with notable variations in predominantly male or female\noccupations.

    "abstract": "Predicting stroke risk is a complex challenge that can be enhanced by\nintegrating diverse clinically available data modalities. This study introduces\na self-supervised multimodal framework that combines 3D brain imaging, clinical\ndata, and image-derived features to improve stroke risk prediction prior to\nonset. By leveraging large unannotated clinical datasets, the framework\ncaptures complementary and synergistic information across image and tabular\ndata modalities. Our approach is based on a contrastive learning framework that\ncouples contrastive language-image pretraining with an image-tabular matching\nmodule, to better align multimodal data representations in a shared latent\nspace. The model is trained on the UK Biobank, which includes structural brain\nMRI and clinical data. We benchmark its performance against state-of-the-art\nunimodal and multimodal methods using tabular, image, and image-tabular\ncombinations under diverse frozen and trainable model settings. The proposed\nmodel outperformed self-supervised tabular (image) methods by 2.6% (2.6%) in\nROC-AUC and by 3.3% (5.6%) in balanced accuracy. Additionally, it showed a 7.6%\nincrease in balanced accuracy compared to the best multimodal supervised model.\nThrough interpretable tools, our approach demonstrated better integration of\ntabular and image data, providing richer and more aligned embeddings.\nGradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping heatmaps further revealed activated\nbrain regions commonly associated in the literature with brain aging, stroke\nrisk, and clinical outcomes. This robust self-supervised multimodal framework\nsurpasses state-of-the-art methods for stroke risk prediction and offers a\nstrong foundation for future studies integrating diverse data modalities to\nadvance clinical predictive modelling.",

Our hierarchical curation pipelines, designed by\ndrug discovery experts, go beyond the primary high-throughput screen by\nleveraging additional confirmatory and counter screens along with rigorous\ndomain-driven preprocessing, such as Pan-Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS)\nfiltering, to ensure the high-quality data in the datasets; WelQrate Evaluation\nFramework - we propose a standardized model evaluation framework considering\nhigh-quality datasets, featurization, 3D conformation generation, evaluation\nmetrics, and data splits, which provides a reliable benchmarking for drug\ndiscovery experts conducting real-world virtual screening; Benchmarking - we\nevaluate model performance through various research questions using the\nWelQrate dataset collection, exploring the effects of different models, dataset\nquality, featurization methods, and data splitting strategies on the results.\nIn summary, we recommend adopting our proposed WelQrate as the gold standard in\nsmall molecule drug discovery benchmarking.

    "abstract": "This study presents a new higher-order super-compact (HOSC) finite difference\nscheme for analyzing enhanced heat transfer of three-dimensional (3D) nanofluid\nnatural convection in a cubic cavity. The unique contribution of the present\nwork lies in the extension of the higher-order super-compact finite difference\nscheme to examine the natural convection of nanofluid in the 3D cavity. This\nnumerical approach achieves fourth-order spatial accuracy and second-order\ntemporal accuracy. `Super-compact' term signifies its efficiency, utilizing 19\ngrid points at the current time level $(n^{th}$ time level$)$ and just seven\ngrid points at the subsequent time level $((n + 1)^{th}$ time level$)$ around\nwhich the finite difference discretization is made. The nanoparticle volume\nfraction is maintained up to 0.04 (4\\%) to ensure the mixture exhibits\nNewtonian behavior. The newly developed numerical scheme is validated by\nqualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing benchmark results. The\nscheme is then applied to investigate fluid flow and heat transfer phenomena in\na Cu-water nanofluid-filled cavity over a range of Rayleigh numbers ($10^2 \\leq\nRa \\leq 10^5$). In addition to introducing the new HOSC scheme for the\nconvection of nanofluids, we examine two cases: the natural convection of\nnanofluid in a simple 3D cavity, and a configuration incorporating two aluminum\nconducting fins on the heated wall to further enhance the heat transfer rate.\nResults are presented through isotherms, streamlines, local Nusselt numbers,\nand average Nusselt numbers for both the considered cases and compared their\nresults. It is found that the addition of nanoparticles or conducting fins does\nnot always lead to enhanced heat transfer rates. Instead, the effectiveness of\nthese enhancements is highly dependent on a range of parameters, which are\nthoroughly examined and discussed in this work.",

First, when\nrelatively small amounts of noise are introduced to the point cloud, persistent\nhomology is unable to recover the true shape of $\\mathcal{S}$. Secondly, the\ncomputational complexity of persistent homology scales poorly with the size of\na point cloud.

    "abstract": "The Arecibo Message was a brief binary-encoded communication transmitted into\nspace from the Arecibo Observatory on November 16, 1974, intended to\ndemonstrate human technological prowess. In late 2018, to commemorate the 45th\nanniversary of this message, the Arecibo Observatory initiated the New Arecibo\nMessage competition. Following a series of challenges, our Boriken Voyagers\nteam was recognized as the winner of the competition in August 2020. Although\nthe primary objective of the competition was to conceptualize rather than\ntransmit a message, the collapse of the Arecibo Telescope in December 2020\nprecluded any subsequent transmission efforts. Therefore, to commemorate the\n50th anniversary of the Arecibo Message, this paper presents the Last Arecibo\nMessage, as originally developed for the Arecibo Telescope. If the original\nmessage says \"we are a form of life reaching out to connect\", our message says\n\"we are ready to explore the universe together.\" The prospect of transmitting\nthis or a similar message remains an open question.",

    "abstract": "Molecular communication (MC) in microfluidic channels faces significant\nchallenges in signal detection due to the stochastic nature of molecule\npropagation and dynamic, noisy environments. Conventional detection methods\noften struggle under varying channel conditions, leading to high bit error\nrates (BER) and reduced communication efficiency. This paper introduces ART-Rx,\na novel Adaptive Real-Time Threshold Receiver for MC that addresses these\nchallenges. Implemented within a conceptual system-on-chip (SoC), ART-Rx\nemploys a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to dynamically\nadjust the detection threshold based on observed errors in real time.\nComprehensive simulations using MATLAB and Smoldyn compare ART-Rx's performance\nagainst a statistically optimal detection threshold across various scenarios,\nincluding different levels of interference, concentration shift keying (CSK)\nlevels, flow velocities, transmitter-receiver distances, diffusion\ncoefficients, and binding rates. The results demonstrate that ART-Rx\nsignificantly outperforms conventional methods, maintaining consistently low\nBER and bit error probabilities (BEP) even in high-noise conditions and extreme\nchannel environments. The system exhibits exceptional robustness to\ninterference and shows the potential to enable higher data rates in CSK\nmodulation. Furthermore, because ART-Rx is effectively adaptable to varying\nenvironmental conditions in microfluidic channels, it offers a computationally\nefficient and straightforward approach to enhance signal detection in nanoscale\ncommunication systems. This approach presents a promising control theory-based\nsolution to improve the reliability of data transmission in practical MC\nsystems, with potential applications in healthcare, brain-machine interfaces\n(BMI), and the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT).",

Conventional physics\nmechanisms such as $s(\\bar{s})$ spin polarization fail to accommodate this\n$\\rho_{00}$ signal, motivating further investigation into its origin. Recent\nstudies from a general framework utilizing the gauge/gravity duality predict\nthat there could be non-zero helicity-frame spin alignment generated by the\nrelative motion of $s\\bar{s}$ pairs to the thermal background in heavy-ion\ncollisions, leading to significant global $\\rho_{00}$. In this work, we derive\nthe expected relationships between $\\phi$-meson helicity and global-frame spin\ndensity matrix elements and confirm these analytical results using Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The effects on these relationships from finite elliptic flow and\nvarious kinematic selections are also examined. Additionally, we extract\n$\\rho_{00}$ simultaneously with the off-diagonal elements from the\n2-dimensional $\\theta^{*}$ and $\\beta$ angular dimensions, as opposed to the\nstandard 1-dimensional extraction of $\\rho_{00}$. These angles describe the\ndirection of a daughter kaon's momentum in the $\\phi$-meson's rest frame, where\n$\\theta^{*}$ is the polar angle with respect to the chosen spin-quantization\naxis, and $\\beta$ is the azimuthal angle in the perpendicular plane. This\n2-dimensional method allows us to consider possible effects from finite\ngeometric acceptance and detector efficiencies, which could couple to the spin\ndensity matrix elements and influence the extraction of these elements within\nthe same frame.

We applied the Comptonization model\nto describe an evolution of NGC~1566 X-ray spectra during outbursts and\ncompared these results with a typical behavior for other AGNs to identify some\ndifferences and common properties that can ultimately help us to better\nunderstand the physics of the CL phenomenon. We found that changes in the X-ray\nproperties of NGC1566 are characterized by a different combination of Sy1\n(using 1H0707-495 as a representative) and Sy2 properties (using NGC7679 and\nMrk3 as their representatives). At high X-ray luminosities NGC1566 exhibits the\nbehavior typical for Sy1, and at low luminosities we see a transition of\nNGC1566 from the Sy1 behavior to the Sy2 pattern. We revealed the saturation of\nthe spectral indices, \\=a for these four AGNs during outbursts (\\=a_1566~1.1,\n\\=a _0707~2, \\=a _7679~0.9 and \\=a_mrk3~0.9) and determined the masses of the\nblack holes (BHs) in the centers of these AGNs namely, M_0707~6.8x10^7 M_sol,\nM_7679~8.4x10^6 M_sol, M_mrk3~2.2x10^8 M_sol and M_1566~2x10^5 M_sol, applying\nthe scaling method. Our spectral analysis shows that the changing-look of\nNGC1566 from Sy1.2 to Sy1.9 in 2019 was accompanied by the transition of\nNGC1566 to an accretion regime which is typical for the intermediate and highly\nsoft spectral states of other BHs. We also find that when going from Sy2 to\nSy1, the spectrum of NGC1566 shows an increase in the soft excess accompanied\nby a decrease in the Comptonized fraction (0.1<f<0.5), which is consistent with\nthe typical behavior of BH sources during X-ray outburst decay.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents the results of a theoretical study of the noise shielding\neffect of a subsonic turbulent jet located near a rigid screen. The developed\ntheoretical model, based on the methods of the Geometrical Theory of\nDiffraction (GTD), takes into account the effects of scattering of the\nhydrodynamic fluctuations of the jet near field at the edges of the screen and\ndiffraction of acoustic perturbations generated by small-scale turbulence.\nSmall-scale turbulent noise radiating pulsations are described within the\nframework of the correlation theory of jet noise in the form of compact\nquadrupole sources distributed along the jet axis. Hydrodynamic near-field\nfluctuations are approximated as a superposition of Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability wave packets of different azimuthal numbers. Typical parameters of\nboth types of fluctuations are adjusted using experimental data on the near and\nfar fields of a free jet issuing from a profiled nozzle with a diameter of 0.04\nm at a velocity of 181 m/s. The result of the jet noise shielding efficiency\ncalculation, using the developed model, is in good agreement with the\nexperimental data obtained for the jet-plate configuration, including correct\nreproduction of the low-frequency noise amplification (jet-plate installation\nnoise) and the effect of high-frequency noise decrease (shielding itself).",

    "abstract": "The exclusivity principle (E-principle) states that the sum of probabilities\nof pairwise exclusive events cannot exceed 1. Unlike other principles proposed\nto characterize quantum correlations, its intrinsically non-bipartite\nformulation enables its application in more general contextuality scenarios.\nAlthough equivalent to the no-signalling condition for any bipartite Bell\nscenario, this equivalence breaks down for two independent copies of the same\nscenario. Such violation of the E-principle due to multiple copies, known as\nits activation effect, was studied in [Nat Commun 4, 2263 (2013)] for the\nnonlocal extremal boxes of $(2,m,2)$, $(2,2,d)$, and $(3,2,2)$ Bell scenarios.\nThe authors mapped the problem of exhibiting activation effects to finding\ncertain cliques inside joint exclusivity graphs. In this work, we refine the\njoint exclusivity structure to be an edge-colored exclusivity multigraph. This\nallows us to draw a novel connection to Ramsey theory, which guarantees the\nexistence of certain monochromatic subgraphs in sufficiently large edge-colored\ncliques, providing a powerful tool for ruling out E-principle violations. We\nthen exploit this connection, drawing on Ramsey-theoretic results to study\nviolations of the E-principle by multiple copies of the contextual extremal\nboxes of $n$-cycle scenarios, called $n$-cycle PR boxes. For the usual ($n=4$)\nPR box we show that the known E-principle violation of $5/4$ is the maximal\nachievable using two copies, and that this same upper bound applies to two\ncopies of the KCBS ($n = 5$) PR box. We then prove that $n \\geq 6$-cycle PR\nboxes, unlike the extremal boxes of the aforementioned Bell scenarios, do not\nexhibit activation effects with two or three copies. Finally, for any number of\nindependent copies $k$, we establish a lower bound on $n$ above which $n$-cycle\nPR boxes do not exhibit activation effects with $k$ copies.",

Also, in the specific case where an exceptional bifurcation point is\nmet, a numerical strategy enforcing the presence of Jordan blocks in the\nJacobian matrix during the procedure, is devised.

The numerical results show the ability of the ROMs to\ncorrectly predict the amplitude of the limit cycles up to a certain range, and\nit is shown that computing the ROM after the Hopf bifurcation gives the most\nsatisfactory results.

Acute fetal inflammatory\nresponse (FIR) is characterized by infiltration of the umbilical cord by fetal\nneutrophils, and can be associated with neonatal sepsis or fetal inflammatory\nresponse syndrome. Recent advances in deep learning in digital pathology have\ndemonstrated favorable performance across a wide range of clinical tasks, such\nas diagnosis and prognosis. In this study we classified FIR from whole slide\nimages (WSI). We digitized 4100 histological slides of umbilical cord stained\nwith hematoxylin and eosin(H&E) and extracted placental diagnoses from the\nelectronic health record. We build models using attention-based whole slide\nlearning models. We compared strategies between features extracted by a model\n(ConvNeXtXLarge) pretrained on non-medical images (ImageNet), and one\npretrained using histopathology images (UNI). We trained multiple iterations of\neach model and combined them into an ensemble. The predictions from the\nensemble of models trained using UNI achieved an overall balanced accuracy of\n0.836 on the test dataset. In comparison, the ensembled predictions using\nConvNeXtXLarge had a lower balanced accuracy of 0.7209. Heatmaps generated from\ntop accuracy model appropriately highlighted arteritis in cases of FIR 2. In\nFIR 1, the highest performing model assigned high attention to areas of\nactivated-appearing stroma in Wharton's Jelly. However, other high-performing\nmodels assigned attention to umbilical vessels. We developed models for\ndiagnosis of FIR from placental histology images, helping reduce interobserver\nvariability among pathologists.

Digital whole slide images (WSIs) capture detailed tissue information,\nbut their giga-pixel size necessitates computational methods based on multiple\ninstance learning, which typically analyze small, isolated image tiles without\nthe spatial context of the TME. To address this limitation and incorporate TME\nspatial histology interactions in predicting NAC response for TNBC patients, we\ndeveloped a histology context-aware transformer graph convolution network\n(NACNet). Our deep learning method identifies the histopathological labels on\nindividual image tiles from WSIs, constructs a spatial TME graph, and\nrepresents each node with features derived from tissue texture and social\nnetwork analysis. It predicts NAC response using a transformer graph\nconvolution network model enhanced with graph isomorphism network layers. We\nevaluate our method with WSIs of a cohort of TNBC patient (N=105) and compared\nits performance with multiple state-of-the-art machine learning and deep\nlearning models, including both graph and non-graph approaches. Our NACNet\nachieves 90.0% accuracy, 96.0% sensitivity, 88.0% specificity, and an AUC of\n0.82, through eight-fold cross-validation, outperforming baseline models. These\ncomprehensive experimental results suggest that NACNet holds strong potential\nfor stratifying TNBC patients by NAC response, thereby helping to prevent\novertreatment, improve patient quality of life, reduce treatment cost, and\nenhance clinical outcomes, marking an important advancement toward personalized\nbreast cancer treatment.",

These\nare relevant for the relativistic regime of the sterile Majorana fermions and\nthe dynamics of the Standard Model particles acting as spectator processes. In\norder to probe the regime of large $({\\cal O}(10^2))$ washout parameters, we\nadd $\\Delta L = 2$ washout processes, which we derive in the CTP-formalism. To\ndemonstrate their significance, we apply state-of-the-art computational\ntechniques to a simple yet well-motivated phenomenological scenario: unflavored\nleptogenesis in a hierarchical type-I seesaw model. We then perform a parameter\nscan of the final baryon asymmetry and find a constraint $m_\\text{lightest}\n\\lesssim 0.15 \\, \\text{eV}$ on the absolute neutrino mass scale, which is\nslightly less stringent than previously reported bounds obtained without the\naforementioned improvements. The relaxation of the bounds is mainly due to\npartially equilibrated spectator fields, which protect part of the asymmetry\nfrom washout and lead to larger final asymmetries. While this might seem like a\nminor correction, the actual dynamics of the fields is substantially altered by\nthese effects. Even though we focused on a particularly simple scenario for\nleptogenesis, the methods employed here can and should be extended to other\nmodels, thus giving us a more accurate picture of the different leptogenesis\nscenarios.",

Our approach integrates contributions across multiple\nlevels: application, algorithm, circuit, device, and instruction sets. We\nleverage a robust hyperdimensional computing (HD) algorithm with a novel\ndimension-packing method and develop specialized hardware for the end-to-end MS\npipeline to overcome the non-ideal behavior of PCM devices. We further optimize\nmulti-level PCM devices for different tasks by using different materials. We\nalso perform a comprehensive design exploration to improve energy and delay\nefficiency while maintaining accuracy, exploring various combinations of\nhardware and software parameters controlled by the instruction set architecture\n(ISA). SpecPCM, with up to three bits per cell, achieves speedups of up to 82x\nand 143x for MS clustering and DB search tasks, respectively, along with a\nfour-orders-of-magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared with\nstate-of-the-art CPU/GPU tools.",

    "abstract": "We present contemporaneous high-angular-resolution millimeter imaging and\nvisible polarimetric imaging of the nearby asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star W\nHya to better understand the dynamics and dust formation within a few stellar\nradii. The star W Hya was observed in two vibrationally excited H2O lines at\n268 and 251 GHz with ALMA at a spatial resolution of 16 x 20 mas and at 748 and\n820 nm at a resolution of 26 x 27 mas with the VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL. ALMA's high\nspatial resolution allowed us to image strong emission of the vibrationally\nexcited H2O line at 268 GHz (v2 = 2, J_K_a,K_c = 6_5,2 - 7_4,3) over the\nstellar surface instead of absorption against the continuum, which is expected\nfor thermal excitation. Strong, spotty emission was also detected along and\njust outside the stellar disk limb at an angular distance of ~40 mas (~1.9\nstellar radii), extending to ~60 mas (~2.9 stellar radii). Another H2O line (v2\n= 2, J_K_a,K_c = 9_2,8 - 8_3,5) at 251 GHz with a similar upper-level energy\nwas tentatively identified, which shows absorption over the stellar surface.\nThis suggests that the emission over the surface seen in the 268 GHzH2O line is\nsuprathermal or even maser emission. The estimated gas temperature and H2O\ndensity are consistent with the radiatively pumped masers. The 268 GHz H2O line\nreveals global infall at up to ~15 km/s within 2--3 stellar radii, but outflows\nat up to ~8 km/s are also present. The polarized intensity maps obtained in the\nvisible reveal clumpy dust clouds forming within ~40 mas (~1.9 stellar radii)\nwith a particularly prominent cloud in the SW quadrant and a weaker cloud in\nthe east. The 268 GHz H2O emission overlaps very well with the visible\npolarized intensity maps, which suggests that both the nonthermal and likely\nmaser H2O emission and the dust originate from dense, cool pockets in the\ninhomogeneous atmosphere within ~2--3 stellar radii.",

Furthermore, we compared the results obtained\nusing different datasets: Gaia Focused Product Release and the previous Gaia\nData Release 3. We detected a robust Yarkovsky effect in 43 NEAs. As expected,\nwe found an improvement in the orbital elements uncertainty and in the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the Yarkovsky effect detections when using the current\nGaia FPR with double the observing arc compared to the DR3 catalog. We also\nfound nine additional reliable detections of the Yarkovsky effect when using\nthe new Gaia FPR catalog.

    "abstract": "Early dark energy solutions to the Hubble tension introduce an additional\nscalar field which is frozen at early times but becomes dynamical around\nmatter-radiation equality. In order to alleviate the tension, the scalar's\nshare of the total energy density must rapidly shrink from $\\sim 10\\%$ at the\nonset of matter domination to $\\ll 1\\%$ by recombination. This typically\nrequires a steep potential that is imposed $\\textit{ad hoc}$ rather than\nemerging from a concrete particle physics model. Here, we point out an\nalternative possibility: a homogeneous scalar field coupled quadratically to a\ncosmological background of light thermal relics (such as the Standard Model\nneutrino) will acquire an effective potential which can reproduce the dynamics\nnecessary to alleviate the tension. We identify the relevant parameter space\nfor this \"thermo-coupled\" scenario and study its unique phenomenology at the\nbackground level, including the back-reaction on the neutrino mass. Follow-up\nnumerical work is necessary to determine the constraints placed on the model by\nearly-time measurements.",

Although it is expected to be\nhold in a wide class of highly chaotic theories, there are only a few analytic\nexamples demonstrating the strong ETH in special cases, often through methods\nrelated to integrability. In this paper, we explore sufficient conditions for\nthe strong ETH that may apply to a broad range of chaotic theories.

We compute the mode frequencies and geometries of\ntidally distorted stars using perturbation theory, accounting for the effects\nof the Coriolis force and the coupling between different azimuthal orders $m$\nof a multiplet induced by the tidal distortion. For tidally coupled dipole\npressure modes, the tidal coupling dominates over the Coriolis force and the\nresulting pulsations are ``triaxial\", with each of the three modes in a\nmultiplet ``tidally tilted\" to be aligned with the one of the three principal\naxes of the star.

Quadrupole modes have similar but slightly more complex\nbehavior. This amplitude modulation allows for mode identification which can\npotentially enable detailed asteroseismic analyses of tidally tilted pulsators.\nPressure modes should exhibit this behavior in stellar binaries close enough to\nbe tidally synchronized, while gravity modes should remain aligned with the\nstar's spin axis.

A key aspect\nof quantum error correction is the initialization of physical qubits\nrepresenting a logical qubit in a highly entangled state.

In this paper, we employ and compare two mass\nproxies for galaxy clusters: thermodynamics of the intracluster medium and\nkinematics of member galaxies. We select 22 galaxy clusters from the cluster\ncatalog in the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) that have sufficient\noptical and near-infrared observations. We generate multi-band images in the\nenergy range of (0.3, 7) keV for each cluster, and derive their temperature\nprofiles, gas mass profiles and hydrostatic mass profiles using a parametric\napproach that does not assume dark matter halo models. With spectroscopically\nconfirmed member galaxies collected from multiple surveys, we numerically solve\nthe spherical Jeans equation for their dynamical mass profiles. Our results\nquantify the correlation between dynamical mass and line-of-sight velocity\ndispersion with an rms scatter of 0.14 dex. We find the two mass proxies lead\nto roughly the same total mass, with no observed systematic bias. As such, the\n$\\sigma_8$ tension is not specific to hydrostatic mass or weak lensing shears,\nbut also appears with galaxy kinematics. We also compare our hydrostatic masses\nwith the latest weak lensing masses inferred with scaling relations. The\ncomparison shows the weak lensing mass is significantly higher than our\nhydrostatic mass by $\\sim$110%. This might explain the significantly larger\nvalue of $\\sigma_8$ from the latest measurement using eRASS1 clusters than\nalmost all previous estimates in the literature.

    "abstract": "Bootstrapping and rollout are two fundamental principles for value function\nestimation in reinforcement learning (RL). We introduce a novel class of\nBellman operators, called subgraph Bellman operators, that interpolate between\nbootstrapping and rollout methods. Our estimator, derived by solving the fixed\npoint of the empirical subgraph Bellman operator, combines the strengths of the\nbootstrapping-based temporal difference (TD) estimator and the rollout-based\nMonte Carlo (MC) methods. Specifically, the error upper bound of our estimator\napproaches the optimal variance achieved by TD, with an additional term\ndepending on the exit probability of a selected subset of the state space. At\nthe same time, the estimator exhibits the finite-sample adaptivity of MC, with\nsample complexity depending only on the occupancy measure of this subset. We\ncomplement the upper bound with an information-theoretic lower bound, showing\nthat the additional term is unavoidable given a reasonable sample size.\nTogether, these results establish subgraph Bellman estimators as an optimal and\nadaptive framework for reconciling TD and MC methods in policy evaluation.",

We\nshow this by introducing a simple method called attention transfer, where only\nthe attention patterns from a pre-trained teacher ViT are transferred to a\nstudent, either by copying or distilling the attention maps. Since attention\ntransfer lets the student learn its own features, ensembling it with a\nfine-tuned teacher also further improves accuracy on ImageNet.

A UV detection of a CCSN at late times\nthus indicates an additional physical process such as interaction between the\nSN ejecta and the circumstellar material, or viewing down to the central engine\nof the explosion. Both these models have been proposed to explain the peculiar\ntransient AT2018cow, a luminous fast blue optical transient that has been\ndetected in the UV 2-4 years after the event with only marginal fading over\nthis time period. To identify if the late-time UV detection of AT2018cow could\nindicate that it is a CCSN, we investigate if CCSNe are detected in the UV\nbetween 2-5 years after the explosion. We use a sample of 51 nearby (z<0.065)\nCCSNe observed with the Hubble Space Telescope within 2-5 years of discovery.\nWe measure their brightness, or determine an upper limit on the emission\nthrough an artificial star experiment if there is no detection. For two CCSNe\nwe detect a point source within the uncertainty region of the SN position. Both\nhave a low chance alignment probability with bright objects within their host\ngalaxies and are thus likely related to the SNe. Comparing the absolute UV\nmagnitude of AT2018cow to the absolute UV magnitudes of the two potential SN\ndetections, there is no evidence that a late-time UV detection of AT2018cow is\natypical for interacting SNe. However, when limiting to CCSNe closer than\nAT2018cow, we see that it is brighter than the upper limits on most\nnon-detections. Combined with a very small late time photospheric radius of\nAT2018cow, this leads us to conclude that AT2018cow's late-time UV detection\nwas not driven by interaction. It suggests instead that we are possibly viewing\nthe inner region of the explosion. Such properties are naturally expected in\ntidal disruption models and are less straightforward in supernova scenarios.",

To address such limitations, we introduce\nhallucination probing, a new task that classifies LLM-generated text into three\ncategories: aligned, misaligned, and fabricated. Driven by our novel discovery\nthat perturbing key entities in prompts affects LLM's generation of these three\ntypes of text differently, we propose SHINE, a novel hallucination probing\nmethod that does not require external knowledge, supervised training, or LLM\nfine-tuning. SHINE is effective in hallucination probing across three modern\nLLMs, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in hallucination detection,\noutperforming seven competing methods across four datasets and four LLMs,\nunderscoring the importance of probing for accurate detection.",

However, for many of\nthese applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different\nuser inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations\nin order to process user inputs quickly, as they are received.

Aims: Our main objective is to use\ntime-lag measurements of luminous AGN and fit them with sophisticated X-ray\nreverberation time-lags models. In this way we can investigate whether X-ray\nreverberation can indeed explain the observed continuum time lags, and whether\ntime-lag measurements can be used to measure physical parameters such as the\nX-ray corona height and the spin of the black hole (BH) in these systems.\nMethods: We use archival time-lag measurements for quasars from different\nsurveys, and we compute their rest frame, mean time-lags spectrum. We fit the\ndata with analytical X-ray reverberation models, using $\\chi^2$ statistics, and\nfitting for both maximal and non spinning BHs, for various colour correction\nvalues and X-ray corona heights. Results: We found that X-ray reverberation can\nexplain very well the observed time lags, assuming the measured BH mass,\naccretion rate and X-ray luminosity of the quasars in the sample. The model\nagrees well with the data both for non-rotating and maximally rotating BHs, as\nlong as the corona height is larger than $\\sim 40$ gravitational radii. This is\nin agreement with previous results which showed that X-ray reverberation can\nalso explain the disc radius in micro-lensed quasars, for the same corona\nheights. The corona height we measure depends on the model assumption of a\nperfectly flat disc. More realistic disc models may result in lower heights for\nthe X-ray corona.",

Consequently, DEM has become a widely accepted\napproach for tackling engineering problems connected to granular flows and\npowder mechanics. Additionally, DEM can be integrated with grid-based\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, enabling the simulation of chemical\nprocesses taking place, e.g., in fluidized beds. However, DEM is\ncomputationally intensive because of the intrinsic multiscale nature of\nparticulate systems, restricting simulation duration or number of particles.\nTowards this end, NeuralDEM presents an end-to-end approach to replace slow\nnumerical DEM routines with fast, adaptable deep learning surrogates. NeuralDEM\nis capable of picturing long-term transport processes across different regimes\nusing macroscopic observables without any reference to microscopic model\nparameters. First, NeuralDEM treats the Lagrangian discretization of DEM as an\nunderlying continuous field, while simultaneously modeling macroscopic behavior\ndirectly as additional auxiliary fields. Second, NeuralDEM introduces\nmulti-branch neural operators scalable to real-time modeling of\nindustrially-sized scenarios - from slow and pseudo-steady to fast and\ntransient. Such scenarios have previously posed insurmountable challenges for\ndeep learning models.

Our aim is to\nascertain the sensitivity to mass hierarchy and octant of $\\theta_{23}$ in\nthese two experiments in the presence of a decaying neutrino state. We compare\nand contrast the results of the two experimental setups. We find that, in\ngeneral, hierarchy sensitivity decreases in the presence of decay. However, if\nwe consider decay only in the opposite hierarchy (test scenario), in the 2588\nkm setup, the hierarchy sensitivity with the true hierarchy as IH is larger\nthan the no decay case. We also study the dependence of hierarchy sensitivity\nwith true $\\theta_{23}$. We find that the dominant muon background in P2O plays\nan important role in how the hierarchy sensitivity depends on $\\theta_{23}$.\nThe octant sensitivity for both setups increases in the presence of decay\nexcept for the LArTPC setup in case true $\\theta_{23}=49^\\circ$. To understand\nthe octant sensitivity results in the two setups, we check the synergy in\nsensitivity between electron and muon channels as a function of test\n$\\theta_{23}$. We also study the degeneracies in the test\n$\\theta_{23}-\\delta_{CP}$ plane and find that combined analysis of the two\nsetups removes all the degeneracies in the test $\\theta_{23}-\\delta_{CP}$ plane\nat $5\\sigma$ significance.",

    "abstract": "Modern science is formally structured around scholarly publication, where\nscientific knowledge is canonized through citation. Precisely how citations are\ngiven and accrued can provide information about the value of discovery, the\nhistory of scientific ideas, the structure of fields, and the space or scope of\ninquiry. Yet parsing this information has been challenging because citations\nare not simply present or absent; rather, they differ in purpose, function, and\nsentiment. In this paper, we investigate how critical and favorable sentiments\nare distributed across citations, and demonstrate that citation sentiment\ntracks sociocultural norms across scales of collaboration, discipline, and\ncountry. At the smallest scale of individuals, we find that researchers cite\nscholars they have collaborated with more favorably (and less critically) than\nscholars they have not collaborated with. Outside collaborative relationships,\nhigher h-index scholars cite lower h-index scholars more critically. At the\nmesoscale of disciplines, we find that wetlab disciplines tend to be less\ncritical than drylab disciplines, and disciplines that engage in more synthesis\nthrough publishing more review articles tend to be less critical. At the\nlargest scale of countries, we find that greater individualism (and lesser\nacceptance of the unequal distribution of power) is associated with more\ncritical sentiment. Collectively, our results demonstrate how sociocultural\nfactors can explain variations in sentiment in scientific communication. As\nsuch, our study contributes to a broader understanding of how human factors\ninfluence the practice of science, and underscores the importance of\nconsidering the larger sociocultural contexts in which science progresses.",

In this work we propose an application specific integrated circuit\n(ASIC), called Fast ANalog SiPM Integrated Circuit (FANSIC), for the readout of\nlarge SiPMs addressing these limitations. The ASIC has an active summation\nstage, which allows to divide a large detection surface into smaller ones\noffering faster response both in single ended and differential outputs. The\nhigh input bandwidth allows to reach full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) signals or\nthe order of 3--5 ns which limits the impact of internal and external\nuncorrelated noise.

This is accompanied by other challenges such as low cross-sections,\nsignificant photon momentum transfer, and non-negligible phonon scattering.\nOverall, XPD is not only an advantageous approach but also exhibits unexpected\neffects. To disentangle these diffraction influences, we present a PED\nimplementation for the SPRKKR package that utilizes multiple scattering theory\nand a one-step model in the photoemission process. Unlike real-space\nimplementations of the multiple scattering XPD formalism, we propose a k-space\nimplementation based on the layer KKR method.

This model suggests a magnetic moment of\n$2\\mu_B$ which is remarkably close to the experimental value of $1.8 \\mu_B$ [K.\nS. Pedersen et al., Nat. Chem. 10, 1056-1061 (2018)]. From Weiss mean-field\ntheory we predict a weak ferromagnetic Cr-Cr coupling of $\\approx 0.9$ meV.\nThis is consolidated by second order perturbation theory of the RKKY\ninteraction yielding a Cr-Cr coupling of $\\approx 5$ meV. Understanding the\ninteractions in these types of compounds can facilitate designs of\nmetal-organic compounds with tailored magnetic properties.",

Our approach extends existing\nreinforcement learning methods by learning the tail risk measures of the final\nhedging P&L and the optimal hedging strategy at the same time. We carry out\ncomprehensive empirical study to show that, in the out-of-sample tests, the\nproposed reinforcement learning hedging strategy can obtain statistically\nsignificantly lower tail risk and higher mean of the final P&L than delta\nhedging methods.",

The current generation of land models use Plant Functional\nTypes (PFTs) to discretize vegetation functional diversity, but these coarse\ncategorizations often overlook fine-scale variations shaped by local climate,\nsoil, and forest age factors. The lack of governing equations for plant\nadaptation demands a paradigm shift in how we integrate diverse Earth\nobservations to uncover ecological functional dependence on changing\nenvironments. To address this challenge, we developed DifferLand, a\ndifferentiable, hybrid physics and machine learning model that infers the\nspatial distributions of ecological parameters and their relationships with\nenvironmental factors constrained by satellite and in-situ observations. Our\nmodel unifies top-down and bottom-up observational constraints with\nprocess-based knowledge to generate a global analysis of ecological functions\nand their adaptation to environmental gradients. We found PFTs account for less\nthan half of the explainable spatial parameter variations controlling carbon\nfluxes and vegetation states. The remaining parameter variability is largely\ndriven by local climate and forest demography factors, and the learned\nenvironment-parameter relationships lead to enhanced spatial generalization at\nunseen locations. DifferLand identified growing season length, leaf economics,\nand agricultural intensity as the three orthogonal spatial gradients underlying\nparameter variations. Our novel framework can lead to new insights on global\ncarbon cycling by learning directly from data and expanding our understanding\nof local responses of ecosystems to environmental drivers.",

    "abstract": "Specifying all desirable properties of a language model is challenging, but\ncertain requirements seem essential. Given samples from an unknown language,\nthe trained model should produce valid strings not seen in training and be\nexpressive enough to capture the language's full richness. Otherwise,\noutputting invalid strings constitutes \"hallucination,\" and failing to capture\nthe full range leads to \"mode collapse.\" We ask if a language model can meet\nboth requirements.\n  We investigate this within a statistical language generation setting building\non Gold and Angluin. Here, the model receives random samples from a\ndistribution over an unknown language K, which belongs to a possibly infinite\ncollection of languages. The goal is to generate unseen strings from K. We say\nthe model generates from K with consistency and breadth if, as training size\nincreases, its output converges to all unseen strings in K.\n  Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] asked if consistency and breadth in\nlanguage generation are possible. We answer this negatively: for a large class\nof language models, including next-token prediction models, this is impossible\nfor most collections of candidate languages. This contrasts with [KM24]'s\nresult, showing consistent generation without breadth is possible for any\ncountable collection of languages. Our finding highlights that generation with\nbreadth fundamentally differs from generation without breadth.\n  As a byproduct, we establish near-tight bounds on the number of samples\nneeded for generation with or without breadth.\n  Finally, our results offer hope: consistent generation with breadth is\nachievable for any countable collection of languages when negative examples\n(strings outside K) are available alongside positive ones. This suggests that\npost-training feedback, which encodes negative examples, can be crucial in\nreducing hallucinations while limiting mode collapse.",

However, existing causal concept\neffect explanation methods assume complete observation of all concepts involved\nwithin the dataset, which can fail in practice due to incomplete annotations or\nmissing concept data.

    "abstract": "Water's unique hydrogen-bonding network and anomalous properties pose\nsignificant challenges for accurately modeling its structural, thermodynamic,\nand transport behavior across varied conditions. Although machine-learned\npotentials have advanced the prediction of individual properties, a unified\ncomputational framework capable of simultaneously capturing water's complex and\nsubtle properties with high accuracy has remained elusive. Here, we address\nthis challenge by introducing NEP-MB-pol, a highly accurate and efficient\nneuroevolution potential (NEP) trained on extensive many-body polarization\n(MB-pol) reference data approaching coupled-cluster-level accuracy, combined\nwith path-integral molecular dynamics and quantum-correction techniques to\nincorporate nuclear quantum effects. This NEP-MB-pol framework reproduces\nexperimentally measured structural, thermodynamic, and transport properties of\nwater across a broad temperature range, achieving simultaneous, fast, and\naccurate prediction of self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and thermal\nconductivity. Our approach provides a unified and robust tool for exploring\nthermodynamic and transport properties of water under diverse conditions, with\nsignificant potential for broader applications across research fields.",

Under\na $L\\log(L)^{1+\\varepsilon}$-integrabilty assumption on the offspring\ndistribution, we prove that the almost sure limit $W$ of the martingale $(W_n)$\nis not degenerate.

In the case of\nneutrino decay, P2SO can achieve slightly better bounds compared to ESSnuSB and\nMOMENT, although its bounds remain weaker than those provided by DUNE and T2HK.\nRegarding sensitivities to unresolved oscillation parameters, the existence of\nLED has a minimal impact on the determination of CP violation, mass ordering\nand octant.

    "abstract": "Disaggregated evaluation -- estimation of performance of a machine learning\nmodel on different subpopulations -- is a core task when assessing performance\nand group-fairness of AI systems. A key challenge is that evaluation data is\nscarce, and subpopulations arising from intersections of attributes (e.g.,\nrace, sex, age) are often tiny. Today, it is common for multiple clients to\nprocure the same AI model from a model developer, and the task of disaggregated\nevaluation is faced by each customer individually. This gives rise to what we\ncall the multi-task disaggregated evaluation problem, wherein multiple clients\nseek to conduct a disaggregated evaluation of a given model in their own data\nsetting (task). In this work we develop a disaggregated evaluation method\ncalled SureMap that has high estimation accuracy for both multi-task and\nsingle-task disaggregated evaluations of blackbox models. SureMap's efficiency\ngains come from (1) transforming the problem into structured simultaneous\nGaussian mean estimation and (2) incorporating external data, e.g., from the AI\nsystem creator or from their other clients. Our method combines maximum a\nposteriori (MAP) estimation using a well-chosen prior together with\ncross-validation-free tuning via Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE). We\nevaluate SureMap on disaggregated evaluation tasks in multiple domains,\nobserving significant accuracy improvements over several strong competitors.",

This feature vector, analogous to the reservoir\nstate in a conventional RC, is used to perform inference by applying a decision\nlayer trained by linear regression. Photonic NGRC provides a flexible platform\nfor real-time inference by forgoing the need for explicit feedback loops\ninherent to a physical reservoir.

These conditions correspond to Rayleigh numbers in the range\n$10^5 \\lesssim \\mathrm{Ra} \\lesssim 10^9$. The relative density and thus the\nfloating behaviour was varied by employing ice made of H$_2$O-D$_2$O mixtures.\nIn addition, we explored a two-layer stable stratification. We studied the\nmorphological evolution of the cross-section of the cylinders and interpreted\nour observations in the context of their interaction with the convective flow.\nThe cylinders only capsize in fresh water but not when the ambient is saline.\nThis behaviour can be explained by the balance between the torques exerted by\nbuoyancy and drag, which change as the cylinder melts and rotates. We modelled\nthe oscillatory motion of the cylinders after a capsize as a damped non-linear\noscillator. The downward plume of the ice cylinders follows the expected\nscalings for a line-source plume. The plume's Reynolds number scales with\nRayleigh number in two regimes, namely $\\mathrm{Re} \\propto \\mathrm{Ra}^{1/2}$\nfor $\\mathrm{Ra} < O(10^7)$ and $\\mathrm{Re} \\propto \\mathrm{Ra}^{1/3}$ for\n$\\mathrm{Ra} > O(10^7)$, and the heat transfer (nondimensional as Nusselt\nnumber) scales as $\\mathrm{Nu} \\propto \\mathrm{Ra}^{1/3}$. Although the\naddition of salt substantially alters the solutal, thermal and momentum\nboundary layers, these scaling relations hold irrespectively of the initial\nsize or the water salinity.

    "abstract": "We employ techniques from group theory to show that, in many cases, counting\nproblems on graphs are almost as hard to solve in a small number of instances\nas they are in all instances. Specifically, we show the following results.\n  1. Goldreich (2020) asks if, for every constant $\\delta < 1 / 2$, there is an\n$\\tilde{O} \\left( n^2 \\right)$-time randomized reduction from computing the\nnumber of $k$-cliques modulo $2$ with a success probability of greater than $2\n/ 3$ to computing the number of $k$-cliques modulo $2$ with an error\nprobability of at most $\\delta$.\n  In this work, we show that for almost all choices of the $\\delta 2^{n \\choose\n2}$ corrupt answers within the average-case solver, we have a reduction taking\n$\\tilde{O} \\left( n^2 \\right)$-time and tolerating an error probability of\n$\\delta$ in the average-case solver for any constant $\\delta < 1 / 2$. By\n\"almost all\", we mean that if we choose, with equal probability, any subset $S\n\\subset \\{0,1\\}^{n \\choose 2}$ with $|S| = \\delta2^{n \\choose 2}$, then with a\nprobability of $1-2^{-\\Omega \\left( n^2 \\right)}$, we can use an average-case\nsolver corrupt on $S$ to obtain a probabilistic algorithm.\n  2. Inspired by the work of Goldreich and Rothblum in FOCS 2018 to take the\nweighted versions of the graph counting problems, we prove that if the RETH is\ntrue, then for a prime $p = \\Theta \\left( 2^n \\right)$, the problem of counting\nthe number of unique Hamiltonian cycles modulo $p$ on $n$-vertex directed\nmultigraphs and the problem of counting the number of unique half-cliques\nmodulo $p$ on $n$-vertex undirected multigraphs, both require exponential time\nto compute correctly on even a $1 / 2^{n/\\log n}$-fraction of instances.\nMeanwhile, simply printing $0$ on all inputs is correct on at least a $\\Omega\n\\left( 1 / 2^n \\right)$-fraction of instances.",

    "abstract": "White matter alterations are increasingly implicated in neurological diseases\nand their progression. International-scale studies use diffusion-weighted\nmagnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) to qualitatively identify changes in white\nmatter microstructure and connectivity. Yet, quantitative analysis of DW-MRI\ndata is hindered by inconsistencies stemming from varying acquisition\nprotocols. There is a pressing need to harmonize the preprocessing of DW-MRI\ndatasets to ensure the derivation of robust quantitative diffusion metrics\nacross acquisitions. In the MICCAI-CDMRI 2023 QuantConn challenge, participants\nwere provided raw data from the same individuals collected on the same scanner\nbut with two different acquisitions and tasked with preprocessing the DW-MRI to\nminimize acquisition differences while retaining biological variation.\nSubmissions are evaluated on the reproducibility and comparability of\ncross-acquisition bundle-wise microstructure measures, bundle shape features,\nand connectomics. The key innovations of the QuantConn challenge are that (1)\nwe assess bundles and tractography in the context of harmonization for the\nfirst time, (2) we assess connectomics in the context of harmonization for the\nfirst time, and (3) we have 10x additional subjects over prior harmonization\nchallenge, MUSHAC and 100x over SuperMUDI. We find that bundle surface area,\nfractional anisotropy, connectome assortativity, betweenness centrality, edge\ncount, modularity, nodal strength, and participation coefficient measures are\nmost biased by acquisition and that machine learning voxel-wise correction,\nRISH mapping, and NeSH methods effectively reduce these biases. In addition,\nmicrostructure measures AD, MD, RD, bundle length, connectome density,\nefficiency, and path length are least biased by these acquisition differences.",

Here we show that in overdamped active systems, noise is required to\ngenerate persistent elastic waves.

    "abstract": "By augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools, their\ncapacity to solve complex problems has been significantly enhanced. However,\ndespite ongoing advancements in the parsing capabilities of LLMs, incorporating\nall available tools simultaneously in the prompt remains impractical due to the\nvast number of external tools. Consequently, it is essential to provide LLMs\nwith a precise set of tools tailored to the specific task, considering both\nquantity and quality. Current tool retrieval methods primarily focus on\nrefining the ranking list of tools and directly packaging a fixed number of\ntop-ranked tools as the tool set. However, these approaches often fail to equip\nLLMs with the optimal set of tools prior to execution, since the optimal number\nof tools for different tasks could be different, resulting in inefficiencies\nsuch as redundant or unsuitable tools, which impede immediate access to the\nmost relevant tools. This paper addresses the challenge of recommending precise\ntoolsets for LLMs. We introduce the problem of tool recommendation, define its\nscope, and propose a novel Precision-driven Tool Recommendation (PTR) approach.\nPTR captures an initial, concise set of tools by leveraging historical tool\nbundle usage and dynamically adjusts the tool set by performing tool matching,\nculminating in a multi-view-based tool addition. Additionally, we present a new\ndataset, RecTools, and a metric, TRACC, designed to evaluate the effectiveness\nof tool recommendation for LLMs. We further validate our design choices through\ncomprehensive experiments, demonstrating promising accuracy across two open\nbenchmarks and our RecTools dataset.",

A discovery of nonlinearity would hint at a novel understanding of\nthe interplay between gravity and quantum field theory, for example.

Here we outline such an experiment, consisting of a\nstream of random bits (which were generated using Rigetti's Aspen-M-3 chip) as\ninput to an RF signal generator coupled to a cryogenic detector. Projective\nmeasurements of the qubit state, which is originally prepared in an equal\nsuperposition, serve as the random binary output of a signal generator.\nThereafter, spectral analysis of the RF detector would yield a detectable\nexcess signal predicted to arise from such a nonlinear effect. A comparison\nbetween the projective measurements of the quantum bits vs the classical\nbaseline showed no power excess. This sets a new limit on the electromagnetic\nnonlinearity parameter $|\\epsilon| \\lessapprox 1.15 \\times 10^{-12}$, at a\n90.0% confidence level.

Two distinct\ndistributions, long-soft and short-hard bursts, are observed in this plane,\nforming the basis for the long and short classification scheme. Traditionally,\nthis scheme was mapped to two different GRB progenitor classes. However,\nseveral recent bursts have challenged this mapping. This work investigates how\nan observer's viewing angle relative to the jet axis influences the\nduration-hardness plane. We simulate single-pulse GRBs using an optically and\ngeometrically thin homogeneous top-hat jet model. Bursts are simulated with an\nisotropic viewing angle distribution, and we calculate the pulse duration and\nspectral hardness corresponding to \\textit{FERMI} Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)\nenergy bands. The viewing angle significantly impacts spectral hardness for our\nassumed broken power-law spectra, while its effect on duration is less\npronounced. Our analysis indicates that soft and low-luminous bursts are likely\noff-axis events.

The\ncentral hypothesis we explore in this work is that the nugget evaluation\nmethodology, originally developed for the TREC Question Answering Track in\n2003, provides a solid foundation for evaluating RAG systems. As such, our\nefforts have focused on \"refactoring\" this methodology, specifically applying\nlarge language models to both automatically create nuggets and to automatically\nassign nuggets to system answers. We call this the AutoNuggetizer framework.\nWithin the TREC setup, we are able to calibrate our fully automatic process\nagainst a manual process whereby nuggets are created by human assessors\nsemi-manually and then assigned manually to system answers. Based on initial\nresults across 21 topics from 45 runs, we observe a strong correlation between\nscores derived from a fully automatic nugget evaluation and a (mostly) manual\nnugget evaluation by human assessors. This suggests that our fully automatic\nevaluation process can be used to guide future iterations of RAG systems.",

    "abstract": "We present an explicit temporal discretization of particle-in-cell schemes\nfor the Vlasov equation that results in exact energy conservation when combined\nwith an appropriate spatial discretization. The scheme is inspired by a simple,\nsecond-order explicit scheme that conserves energy exactly in the Eulerian\ncontext. We show that direct translation to particle-in-cell does not result in\nstrict conservation, but derive a simple correction based on an analytically\nsolvable optimization problem that recovers conservation. While this\noptimization problem is not guaranteed to have a real solution for every\nparticle, we provide a correction that makes imaginary values extremely rare\nand still admits $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-12})$ fractional errors in energy for\npractical simulation parameters. We present the scheme in both electrostatic --\nwhere we use the Amp\\`{e}re formulation -- and electromagnetic contexts. With\nan electromagnetic field solve, the field update is most naturally linearly\nimplicit, but the more computationally intensive particle update remains fully\nexplicit. We also show how the scheme can be extended to use the fully explicit\nleapfrog and pseudospectral analytic time-domain (PSATD) field solvers. The\nscheme is tested on standard kinetic plasma problems, confirming its\nconservation properties.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, attention mechanisms have significantly enhanced the\nperformance of object detection by focusing on key feature information.\nHowever, prevalent methods still encounter difficulties in effectively\nbalancing local and global features. This imbalance hampers their ability to\ncapture both fine-grained details and broader contextual information-two\ncritical elements for achieving accurate object detection.To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed Local-Global\nAttention, which is designed to better integrate both local and global\ncontextual features. Specifically, our approach combines multi-scale\nconvolutions with positional encoding, enabling the model to focus on local\ndetails while concurrently considering the broader global context.\nAdditionally, we introduce a learnable parameters, which allow the model to\ndynamically adjust the relative importance of local and global attention,\ndepending on the specific requirements of the task, thereby optimizing feature\nrepresentations across multiple scales.We have thoroughly evaluated the\nLocal-Global Attention mechanism on several widely used object detection and\nclassification datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that this\napproach significantly enhances the detection of objects at various scales,\nwith particularly strong performance on multi-class and small object detection\ntasks. In comparison to existing attention mechanisms, Local-Global Attention\nconsistently outperforms them across several key metrics, all while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.",

To address these limitations, this paper\nproposes a novel framework for optimizing the beam scheduling and resource\nallocation in multi-beam LEO systems. To satisfy the uneven terrestrial traffic\ndemand, a hybrid beam pattern is employed to enhance the downlink quality of\nservice and minimize the transmission latency from LEO satellites to ground\nuser terminals.

Starting from\nany NP-complete language, for each $\\alpha > 0$, we construct a function that\ncannot be computed correctly even on a $1/n^\\alpha$-fraction of instances for\npolynomial-sized circuit families if NP $\\not \\subset$ P/POLY and by\npolynomial-time algorithms if NP $\\not \\subset$ BPP - functions that are\nrare-case hard against polynomial-sized circuits and polynomial-time randomized\nalgorithms. The constructed function is a number-theoretic polynomial evaluated\nover specific finite fields. For NP-complete languages that admit parsimonious\nreductions from all of NP (for example, SAT), the constructed functions are\nhard to compute even on a $1/n^\\alpha$-fraction of instances by polynomial-time\nrandomized algorithms and polynomial-sized circuit families simply if P# $\\not\n\\subset$ BPP and P# $\\not \\subset$ P/POLY, respectively. We also show that if\nthe Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis (RETH) is true, none of these\nconstructed functions can be computed even on a $1/n^\\alpha$-fraction of\ninstances in subexponential time.

    "abstract": "Numerical modeling errors are unavoidable in finite element analysis. The\npresence of model errors inherently reflects both model accuracy and\nuncertainty. To date there have been few methods for explicitly quantifying\nerrors at points of interest (e.g. at finite element nodes). The lack of\nexplicit model error approximators has been addressed recently with the\nemergence of machine learning (ML), which closes the loop between numerical\nmodel features/solutions and explicit model error approximations. In this\npaper, we propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for simultaneous\nnumerical model error approximation and superresolution. To test our approach,\nnumerical data was generated using finite element simulations on a\ntwo-dimensional elastic plate with a central opening. Four- and eight-node\nquadrilateral elements were used in the discretization to represent the\nreduced-order and higher-order models, respectively. It was found that the\ndeveloped PINNs effectively predict model errors in both x and y displacement\nfields with small differences between predictions and ground truth. Our\nfindings demonstrate that the integration of physics-informed loss functions\nenables neural networks (NNs) to surpass a purely data-driven approach for\napproximating model errors.",

    "abstract": "The behavior of systems far from equilibrium is often complex and\nunpredictable, challenging and sometimes overturning the physical intuition\nderived from equilibrium scenarios. One striking example of this is the Mpemba\neffect, which implies that non-equilibrium states can sometimes relax more\nrapidly when they are further from equilibrium. Despite a rich historical\nbackground, the precise conditions and mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain\nunclear. Recently, there has been growing interest in investigating accelerated\nrelaxation and Mpemba-like effects within quantum systems. In this work, we\nexplore a quantum manifestation of the Mpemba effect in a simple and\nparadigmatic model of open quantum systems: the damped quantum harmonic\noscillator, which describes the relaxation of a bosonic mode in contact with a\nthermal bath at finite temperature $T$. By means of an exact analytical\nanalysis of the relaxation dynamics based on the method of moments in both\npopulation and coherence subspaces, we demonstrate that any initial\ndistribution of populations with the first $r$ moments exactly matching those\nof the equilibrium distribution shows a super-accelerated relaxation to\nequilibrium at a rate linearly increasing with $r$, leading to a pronounced\nMpemba effect. In particular, one can find a broad class of\nfar-from-equilibrium distributions that relax to equilibrium faster than any\nother initial thermal state with a temperature $T'$ arbitrarily close to $T$.\nThe super-accelerated relaxation effect is shown to persist even for a broad\nclass of initial states with non-vanishing coherences, and a general criterion\nfor the observation of super-accelerated thermalization is presented.",

To address this limitation,\nwe introduce Spider, a novel efficient Any-to-Many Modalities Generation (AMMG)\nframework, which can generate an arbitrary combination of modalities 'Text +\nXs', such as Text + {Image and Audio and Video}. To achieve efficient AMMG, our\nSpider integrates three core components: a Base Model for basic X-to-X (i.e.,\nAny-to-Any) modality processing, an Any-to-Many Instruction Template designed\nfor producing Xs signal prompts, and a novel Efficient Decoders-Controller for\ncontrolling multimodal Decoders to generate Xs (many-modal) contents. To train\nSpider, we constructed a novel Text-formatted Many-Modal (TMM) dataset, which\nfacilitates learning the X-to-Xs (i.e., Any-to-Many) capability necessary for\nAMMG. Ultimately, the well-trained Spider generates a pseudo X-to-Xs dataset,\nthe first-ever X-to-Xs many-modal dataset, enhancing the potential for AMMG\ntasks in future research.

PSM crafts matched datasets, mimicking some\nattributes of randomized designs, from observational data. In a valid PSM\ndesign where all baseline confounders are measured and matched, the confounders\nwould be balanced, allowing the treatment status to be considered as if it were\nrandomly assigned. Nevertheless, recent research has unveiled a different facet\nof PSM, termed \"the PSM paradox.\" As PSM approaches exact matching by\nprogressively pruning matched sets in order of decreasing propensity score\ndistance, it can paradoxically lead to greater covariate imbalance, heightened\nmodel dependence, and increased bias, contrary to its intended purpose.\nMethods: We used analytic formula, simulation, and literature to demonstrate\nthat this paradox stems from the misuse of metrics for assessing chance\nimbalance and bias. Results: Firstly, matched pairs typically exhibit different\ncovariate values despite having identical propensity scores. However, this\ndisparity represents a \"chance\" difference and will average to zero over a\nlarge number of matched pairs. Common distance metrics cannot capture this\n``chance\" nature in covariate imbalance, instead reflecting increasing\nvariability in chance imbalance as units are pruned and the sample size\ndiminishes. Secondly, the largest estimate among numerous fitted models,\nbecause of uncertainty among researchers over the correct model, was used to\ndetermine statistical bias. This cherry-picking procedure ignores the most\nsignificant benefit of matching design-reducing model dependence based on its\nrobustness against model misspecification bias.

This\ntransition -- which occurs around the well-known period gap (around 2-3 hours)\n-- is expected, as DNe with larger orbital periods typically harbour more\nmassive donors, which contribute to the visible flux. However, this transition\nis not abrupt. Within the same range of periods, we observe systems dominated\nby ellipsoidal variations, where the companion star is clearly visible, as well\nas others dominated by the disc and hot spot.

Moon offers a unique environment for such detectors due to\nconstrained noise sources, since unlike Earth it does not have ocean and\natmosphere. In this paper, we further explore the idea of using Moon as a giant\nresonator of GWs, a proposal that was first introduced by Weber in 1969. This\nidea is relaying on the theory how GWs interact with free masses and finally\nelastic solids, such as is a planet to some approximation. We start by\ncarefully setting up General Relativity (physics) and elastic theory\n(geophysics) background to be able to derive analytically the coupling between\nGWs and elastic solids through associated equations of motion. Once the\nanalytical solution is derived, we explore the parameter space this interaction\ndepends on. This eventually provides us with the transfer function, which\ndefines the frequency band of the interest. We show how this interaction\nrobustly depends on the regolith structure by altering the initial lunar model\nand exploring different regolith models. Our results show that detection might\nbe troublesome in the high frequency regime between 0.1 and 1 Hz, without\nbeforehand constraining the regolith structure with geophysical methods.\nFinally, we discuss what are the implications of detecting these signals with\nthe future GW detectors build on the Moon.",

Our approach incorporates a constrained\noptimization problem within the deviation learning framework to update instance\nweights, resolving this problem for each mini-batch.

This predicted emission is strongly dependent on a modelled\nprescription of the ion-to-electron temperature ratio. The most promising\nmodels are magnetically arrested disk (MAD) states. However, nearly all MAD\nmodels exhibit larger temporal fluctuations in radiative 230 GHz emission\ncompared to observations. This limitation possibly stems from the fact that the\nactual temperature ratio depends on microphysical dissipation, radiative\nprocesses and other effects not captured in ideal fluid simulations. Therefore,\nwe investigate the effects of two-temperature (2T) thermodynamics in MAD GRMHD\nsimulations of Sgr A*, where the temperatures of both species are evolved. We\nfind that the 230 GHz synchrotron flux variability more closely matches\nhistorical observations when we include the 2T treatment compared to 1T\nsimulations. For the low accretion rates of Sgr A*, a common assumption is to\nneglect radiative cooling. However, we find that the radiative cooling of\nelectrons-via synchrotron, inverse Compton, and bremsstrahlung\nprocesses-reduces the electron temperature in the inner disk, where the EHT\nobserves, by about 10%, which, in turn, decreases both the (sub)millimetre\nsynchrotron flux and its temporal fluctuations compared to uncooled\nsimulations.",

First, acquiring complete pixel-level segmentation\nlabels for medical images is time-consuming and requires domain expertise.\nSecond, typical segmentation pipelines cannot detect out-of-distribution (OOD)\npixels, leaving them prone to spurious outputs during deployment. In this work,\nwe propose a novel segmentation approach which broadly falls within the\npositive-unlabelled (PU) learning paradigm and exploits tools from OOD\ndetection techniques. Our framework learns only from sparsely annotated pixels\nfrom multiple positive-only classes and does not use any annotation for the\nbackground class. These multi-class positive annotations naturally fall within\nthe in-distribution (ID) set. Unlabelled pixels may contain positive classes\nbut also negative ones, including what is typically referred to as\n\\emph{background} in standard segmentation formulations. Here, we forgo the\nneed for background annotation and consider these together with any other\nunseen classes as part of the OOD set. Our framework can integrate, at a\npixel-level, any OOD detection approaches designed for classification tasks. To\naddress the lack of existing OOD datasets and established evaluation metric for\nmedical image segmentation, we propose a cross-validation strategy that treats\nheld-out labelled classes as OOD.

    "abstract": "Existing claim verification datasets often do not require systems to perform\ncomplex reasoning or effectively interpret multimodal evidence. To address\nthis, we introduce a new task: multi-hop multimodal claim verification. This\ntask challenges models to reason over multiple pieces of evidence from diverse\nsources, including text, images, and tables, and determine whether the combined\nmultimodal evidence supports or refutes a given claim. To study this task, we\nconstruct MMCV, a large-scale dataset comprising 15k multi-hop claims paired\nwith multimodal evidence, generated and refined using large language models,\nwith additional input from human feedback. We show that MMCV is challenging\neven for the latest state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,\nespecially as the number of reasoning hops increases. Additionally, we\nestablish a human performance benchmark on a subset of MMCV. We hope this\ndataset and its evaluation task will encourage future research in multimodal\nmulti-hop claim verification.",

The evolving compute-in-memory (CiM) paradigm tackles this issue\nby facilitating simultaneous processing and storage within static random-access\nmemory (SRAM) elements. Numerous design decisions taken at different levels of\nhierarchy affect the figure of merits (FoMs) of SRAM, such as power,\nperformance, area, and yield. The absence of a rapid assessment mechanism for\nthe impact of changes at different hierarchy levels on global FoMs poses a\nchallenge to accurately evaluating innovative SRAM designs. This paper presents\nan automation tool designed to optimize the energy and latency of SRAM designs\nincorporating diverse implementation strategies for executing logic operations\nwithin the SRAM. The tool structure allows easy comparison across different\narray topologies and various design strategies to result in energy-efficient\nimplementations. Our study involves a comprehensive comparison of over 6900+\ndistinct design implementation strategies for EPFL combinational benchmark\ncircuits on the energy-recycling resonant compute-in-memory (rCiM) architecture\ndesigned using TSMC 28 nm technology. When provided with a combinational\ncircuit, the tool aims to generate an energy-efficient implementation strategy\ntailored to the specified input memory and latency constraints.

    "abstract": "Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an indispensable method of fluid\nmodelling in engineering applications, reducing the need for physical\nprototypes and testing for tasks such as design optimisation and performance\nanalysis. Depending on the complexity of the system under consideration, models\nranging from low to high fidelity can be used for prediction, allowing\nsignificant speed-up. However, the choice of model requires information about\nthe actual dynamics of the flow regime. Correctly identifying the\nregions/clusters of flow that share the same dynamics has been a challenging\nresearch topic to date. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid approach to\nflow clustering. It consists of characterising each sample point of the system\nwith equation-based features, i.e. features are budgets that represent the\ncontribution of each term from the original governing equation to the local\ndynamics at each sample point. This was achieved by applying the Sparse\nIdentification of Nonlinear Dynamical systems (SINDy) method pointwise to time\nevolution data. The method proceeds with equation-based clustering using the\nGirvan-Newman algorithm. This allows the detection of communities that share\nthe same physical dynamics. The algorithm is implemented in both Eulerian and\nLagrangian frameworks. In the Lagrangian, i.e. dynamic approach, the clustering\nis performed on the trajectory of each point, allowing the change of clusters\nto be represented also in time. The performance of the algorithm is first\ntested on a flow around a cylinder. The construction of the dynamic clusters in\nthis test case clearly shows the evolution of the wake from the steady state\nsolution through the transient to the oscillatory solution. Dynamic clustering\nwas then successfully tested on turbulent flow data. Two distinct and\nwell-defined clusters were identified and their temporal evolution was\nreconstructed.",

At this stage the geometry of the ship is already\nfinalized and the designer choose the thickness of the primary structural\nelements, such as decks, bulkheads, and the shell. Reduced order modeling and\nblack-box optimization techniques reduce the use of expensive finite element\nanalysis to only validate the most promising configurations, thanks to the\nefficient exploration of the domain of decision variables. However, the quality\nof the final results heavily relies on the problem formulation, and on how the\nstructural elements are assigned to the decision variables. With the increased\nrequest for alternative fuels and engine technologies, the designers are often\nfaced with novel configurations and risk producing ill-suited\nparameterizations. To address this issue, we enhanced a structural optimization\npipeline for cruise ships developed in collaboration with Fincantieri S.p.A.\nwith a novel data-driven hierarchical reparameterization procedure, based on\nthe optimization of a series of sub-problems. Moreover, we implemented a\nmulti-objective optimization module to provide the designers with insights into\nthe efficient trade-offs between competing quantities of interest and enhanced\nthe single-objective Bayesian optimization module. The new pipeline is tested\non a simplified midship section and a full ship hull, comparing the automated\nreparameterization to a baseline model provided by the designers.

    "abstract": "We study a setting where agents use no-regret learning algorithms to\nparticipate in repeated auctions. \\citet{kolumbus2022auctions} showed, rather\nsurprisingly, that when bidders participate in second-price auctions using\nno-regret bidding algorithms, no matter how large the number of interactions\n$T$ is, the runner-up bidder may not converge to bidding truthfully. Our first\nresult shows that this holds for \\emph{general deterministic} truthful\nauctions. We also show that the ratio of the learning rates of the bidders can\n\\emph{qualitatively} affect the convergence of the bidders. Next, we consider\nthe problem of revenue maximization in this environment. In the setting with\nfully rational bidders, \\citet{myerson1981optimal} showed that revenue can be\nmaximized by using a second-price auction with reserves.We show that, in stark\ncontrast, in our setting with learning bidders, \\emph{randomized} auctions can\nhave strictly better revenue guarantees than second-price auctions with\nreserves, when $T$ is large enough. Finally, we study revenue maximization in\nthe non-asymptotic regime. We define a notion of {\\em auctioneer regret}\ncomparing the revenue generated to the revenue of a second price auction with\ntruthful bids. When the auctioneer has to use the same auction throughout the\ninteraction, we show an (almost) tight regret bound of $\\smash{\\widetilde\n\\Theta(T^{3/4})}.$ If the auctioneer can change auctions during the\ninteraction, but in a way that is oblivious to the bids, we show an (almost)\ntight bound of $\\smash{\\widetilde \\Theta(\\sqrt{T})}.$",

Both require a proposal\ndistribution that globally approximates the target distribution. The\nRadon-Nikodym derivative of the target distribution relative to the proposal is\ncalled the weight function. Under the assumption that the weight is unbounded\nbut has finite moments under the proposal distribution, we study the\napproximation error of importance sampling and of the particle independent\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm (PIMH), which includes IMH as a special case. For\nthe chains generated by such algorithms, we show that the common random numbers\ncoupling is maximal. Using that coupling we derive bounds on the total\nvariation distance of a PIMH chain to its target distribution. Our results\nallow a formal comparison of the finite-time biases of importance sampling and\nIMH, and we find the latter to be have a smaller bias. We further consider bias\nremoval techniques using couplings, and provide conditions under which the\nresulting unbiased estimators have finite moments. These unbiased estimators\nprovide an alternative to self-normalized importance sampling, implementable in\nthe same settings.

To learn\ngolden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in\nthis paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \\textit{noise prompt},\nwhich aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a\nsmall desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the\nconcept, we first formulate the \\textit{noise prompt learning} framework that\nsystematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt\nfor diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline\nand collect a large-scale \\textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains\n100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts.\nWith the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \\textit{noise\nprompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise\ninto a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as\na kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored\nto the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the\nimpressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality\nof synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL,\nDreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT. Moreover, NPNet is a small and\nefficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited\nadditional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden\nnoise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.",

    "abstract": "Path homology plays a central role in digraph topology and GLMY theory more\ngeneral. Unfortunately, the computation of the path homology of a digraph $G$\nis a two-step process, and until now no complete description of even the\nunderlying chain complex has appeared in the literature.\n  In this paper we introduce an inductive method of constructing elements of\nthe path homology chain modules $\\Omega_n(G;R)$ from elements in the proceeding\ntwo dimensions. This proceeds via the formation of what we call upper and lower\n\\emph{extensions}, that are parametrised by certain labeled multihypergraphs\nwhich we introduce and call \\emph{face multihypergraphs}.\n  When the coefficient ring $R$ is a finite field the inductive elements we\nconstruct generate $\\Omega_*(G;R)$. With integral or rational coefficients, the\ninductive elements generate at least $\\Omega_i(G;R)$ for $i=0,1,2,3$. Since in\nlow dimensions the inductive elements extended over labeled multigraphs\ncoincide with naturally occurring generating sets up to sign, they are\nexcellent candidates to reduce to a basis.\n  Inductive elements provide a new concrete structure on the path chain complex\nthat can be directly applied to understand path homology, under no restriction\non the digraph $G$. We employ inductive elements to construct a sequence of\ndigraphs whose path Euler characteristic can differ arbitrarily depending on\nthe choice of field coefficients.

This is\na Fuzzball-inspired geometric model, at least in an effective sense. We\ndemonstrate explicitly that in the limit when the Dirichlet wall approaches the\nevent horizon, the normal modes condense fast to yield an effective branch cut\nalong the real line in the complex frequency plane. In turn, in this\napproximation, quasi-normal modes associated to the BTZ black hole emerge and\nthe corresponding two-point function is described by a thermal correlator,\nassociated with the Hawking temperature in the general case and with the\nright-moving temperature in the extremal limit. We further show, analytically,\nthat the presence of a non-vanishing angular momentum non-perturbatively\nenhances this condensation. The consequences are manifold: {\\it e.g.}~there is\nan emergent {\\it strong thermalization} due to these modes, adding further\nsupport to a quantum chaotic nature associated to the spectral form factor. We\nexplicitly demonstrate, by considering a classical collapsing geometry, that\nthe one-loop scalar determinant naturally inherits a Dirichlet boundary\ncondition, as the shell approaches the scale of the event horizon. This\nprovides a plausible dynamical mechanism in the dual CFT through a global\nquench, that can create an emergent Dirichlet boundary close to the\nhorizon-scale. We offer comments on how this simple model can describe salient\nfeatures of Fuzzball-geometries, as well as of extremely compact objects. This\nalso provides an explicit realization of how an effective thermal physics\nemerges from a non-thermal microscopic description, within a semi-classical\naccount of gravity, augmented with an appropriate boundary condition.",

As the fine meshes show an unexpected trend for the TKE, a detailed\ninvestigation is done, mainly to exclude method-related drawbacks from using a\nhybrid URANS/ LES model. It is found that a shift in vortex-core positions\ndistorts the results whereby the experimental center positions which are\nreferenced are questionable. Using a fixed position for all cases improves\ncomparability and gives a different picture. Thereupon the medium meshes were\nenhanced in such a way that one of the refinement boxes was extended further\nforward, now showing much better agreement with the fine meshes.

Therefore, we adopted a systematic review approach to examine the\nlinguistic and readability metrics currently employed for legal and regulatory\ntexts.

Our primary objective was to identify which current\nmetrics were applied for evaluating readability within the legal field.

The majority of studies (73.5%) were found in\nthe domain of \"informed consent forms\".

    "abstract": "Understanding complex collaboration processes is essential for the success of\nconstruction projects. However, there is still a lack of efficient methods for\ntimely collection and analysis of collaborative networks. Therefore, an\nintegrated framework consisting three parts, namely, system updating for data\ncollection, data preprocessing, and social network analysis, is proposed for\nthe twinning and mining collaborative network of a construction project. First,\na system updating strategy for automatic data collection is introduced.\nCentrality measures are then utilized to identify key players, including hubs\nand brokers. Meanwhile, information sharing frequency (ISF) and association\nrule mining are introduced to discover collaborative patterns, that is,\nfrequently collaborating users (FCUs) and associations between information\nflows and task levels. Finally, the proposed framework is validated and\ndemonstrated in a large-scale project. The results show that key players, FCUs,\nand associations between information flows and task levels were successfully\ndiscovered, providing a deep understanding of collaboration and communication\nfor decision-making processes. This research contributes to the body of\nknowledge by: 1) introducing ISF and Apriori-based association mining algorithm\nto identify FCUs and information flow patterns in collaboration; 2)\nestablishing a new data-driven framework to map and analyze fine-grained\ncollaborative networks automatically. It is also shown that people tend to form\nsmall groups to handle certain levels or types of tasks more efficiently. Other\nresearchers and industrial practitioners may use this work as a foundation to\nfurther improve the efficiency of collaboration and communication.",

As\nwe see it, skill provides a counterpoint to the version of intelligence that\nappears to be easily blackboxed in systems like Slack, and that ultimately\nreduces much of what people do to work well together. To put it slightly\ndifferently, skill - as we will argue below - gives us a way into thinking\nabout work as a much more entangled endeavour, unfolding through multiple and\ninterweaving sets of practices, places, tools and collaborations. In this vein,\ndesigning for the future of work seems to be about much more than where work is\ndone or how we might bolt on discrete containers of intelligence.

Assuming that motion flow\nwithin the scene can be approximated by local homography transformations,\nmatches are aggregated into overlapping clusters corresponding to virtual\nplanes using an iterative RANSAC-based approach, with non-conforming\ncorrespondences discarded. Moreover, the underlying planar structural design\nprovides an explicit map between local patches associated with the matches,\nenabling optional refinement of keypoint positions through cross-correlation\ntemplate matching after patch reprojection. Finally, to enhance robustness and\nfault-tolerance against violations of the piece-wise planar approximation\nassumption, a further strategy is designed for minimizing relative patch\ndistortion in the plane reprojection by introducing an intermediate homography\nthat projects both patches into a common plane. The proposed method is\nextensively evaluated on standard datasets and image matching pipelines, and\ncompared with state-of-the-art approaches. Unlike other current comparisons,\nthe proposed benchmark also takes into account the more general, real, and\npractical cases where camera intrinsics are unavailable. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed non-deep learning, geometry-based approach\nachieves performances that are either superior to or on par with recent\nstate-of-the-art deep learning methods.

We\nconsider the reconstruction of mean flow past bluff bodies at low Reynolds\nnumbers as a test case, addressing tasks such as sparse data recovery,\ndenoising, and inpainting of missing flow data. The key strengths of the\napproach lie in its integration of physical constraints into the GNN training\nprocess, leading to accurate predictions with limited data, making it\nparticularly valuable when data are scarce or corrupted.

One possible explanation for\nhow residual connections aid deeper network training is by promoting feature\nreuse. However, we identify and analyze the limitations of feature reuse with\nvanilla residual connections. To address these limitations, we propose\nmodifications in training methods. Specifically, we provide an additional\nopportunity for the model to learn feature reuse with residual connections\nthrough two types of iterations during training. The first type of iteration\ninvolves using droppath, which enforces feature reuse by randomly dropping a\nsubset of layers. The second type of iteration focuses on training the dropped\nparts of the model while freezing the undropped parts. As a result, the dropped\nparts learn in a way that encourages feature reuse, as the model relies on the\nundropped parts with feature reuse in mind.

    "abstract": "The design and capability of a novel time-of-flight secondary ion mass\nspectrometry electrospray propulsion diagnostic is presented to investigate\nsecondary species emission from surface impingement of high-velocity, energetic\nmolecular ion plumes. Designed on the basis of traditional Secondary Ion Mass\nSpectrometry (SIMS) principles, this diagnostic provides information on the\nrelative intensity and chemical composition of secondary species given\nelectrospray operational parameters like incident angle, primary ion energy,\nand target surface composition. The system consists of an externally-wetted\ntungsten ion source operating with room temperature ionic liquid propellant, a\ntarget with a secondary species extraction mesh, and a time-of-flight mass\nspectrometer featuring an electrostatic deflection gate and a multichannel\nplate detector. Results show that energetic primary plume impacts with metallic\nsurfaces induce molecular secondary ion emission in both positive and negative\npolarities. Likely sources of these secondary ions are considered - including\nhydrocarbon contamination of the target surface and charged fragments of the\nmolecular primary ionic liquid ions. For electrospray propulsion, these\nsecondary species contribute not only to lifetime limiting processes intrinsic\nto thruster operation like impingement and thus degradation of electrodes and\nemitters, but also contribute to facility effects corrupting ground-based\ntesting and thruster flight qualification.",

The model\ncomprises a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and convolutional\nlayers that extract interpretable and representative features of colposcopic\nimages to distinguish high-risk and low-risk cervical precancer. In addition,\nthe proposed Cervix-AID-Net model integrates four explainable techniques,\nnamely gradient class activation maps, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic\nExplanations, CartoonX, and pixel rate distortion explanation based on output\nfeature maps and input features. The evaluation using holdout and ten-fold\ncross-validation techniques yielded a classification accuracy of 99.33\\% and\n99.81\\%. The analysis revealed that CartoonX provides meticulous explanations\nfor the decision of the Cervix-AID-Net model due to its ability to provide the\nrelevant piece-wise smooth part of the image. The effect of Gaussian noise and\nblur on the input shows that the performance remains unchanged up to Gaussian\nnoise of 3\\% and blur of 10\\%, while the performance reduces thereafter. A\ncomparison study of the proposed model's performance compared to other deep\nlearning approaches highlights the Cervix-AID-Net model's potential as a\nsupplemental tool for increasing the effectiveness of cervical precancer risk\nassessment.

    "abstract": "In this work we propose a general nonmonotone line-search method for\nnonconvex multi\\-objective optimization problems with convex constraints. At\nthe $k$th iteration, the degree of nonmonotonicity is controlled by a vector\n$\\nu_{k}$ with nonnegative components. Different choices for $\\nu_{k}$ lead to\ndifferent nonmonotone step-size rules. Assuming that the sequence\n$\\left\\{\\nu_{k}\\right\\}_{k\\geq 0}$ is summable, and that the $i$th objective\nfunction has H\\\"older continuous gradient with smoothness parameter $\\theta_i\n\\in(0,1]$, we show that the proposed method takes no more than\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\epsilon^{-\\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\theta_{\\min}}\\right)}\\right)$\niterations to find a $\\epsilon$-approximate Pareto critical point for a problem\nwith $m$ objectives and $\\theta_{\\min}= \\min_{i=1,\\dots, m} \\{\\theta_i\\}$.

    "abstract": "We examine a simple dark sector extension where the observed dark matter (DM)\nabundance arises from a freeze-in process through the decay of heavy\nvector-like quarks into a scalar dark matter candidate. The detection prospects\nof such DM are challenging due to the feeble nature of the interactions, but\nthese vector-like quarks can be produced copiously at the LHC, where they decay\nto Standard Model quarks along with DM. Depending on the decay rate, this\nscenario is typically probed through long-lived particle or displaced vertex\nsignatures, assuming a radiation-dominated background. An alternative\nhypothesis suggests that the Universe may have experienced a rapid expansion\nphase instead of the standard radiation-dominated one during freeze-in. This\nwould significantly alter the dark matter phenomenology, requiring a\nsubstantial increase in the interaction rate to match the observed relic\ndensity, resulting in the rapid decay of the parent particle. As a result, much\nof the parameter space for this scenario is beyond the reach of traditional\nlong-lived particle and displaced vertex searches. Due to this non-standard\ncosmic evolution, existing constraints do not cover the expanded dark matter\nparameter space. We propose a complementary search strategy to explore this\nscenario, offering additional limits alongside searches for long-lived\nparticles and displaced vertices. In our search, we investigate the FIMP dark\nmatter model at the LHC using boosted fatjets and significant missing\ntransverse momentum. To improve precision, we include one-loop QCD corrections\nfor LHC production processes and employ a boosted decision tree multivariate\nanalysis, leveraging jet substructure variables to explore a vast parameter\nspace for this minimally extended FIMP dark matter model at the 14 TeV LHC.",

Commonly used pre-training methods, which typically\nrely on randomized approaches like uniform or Gaussian distributions to\ninitialize model parameters, often fall short when confronted with long-tailed\ndistributions, especially in detection tasks. This is largely due to extreme\ndata imbalance and the issue of simplicity bias. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel pre-training framework for object detection, called Dynamic Rebalancing\nContrastive Learning with Dual Reconstruction (2DRCL). Our method builds on a\nHolistic-Local Contrastive Learning mechanism, which aligns pre-training with\nobject detection by capturing both global contextual semantics and detailed\nlocal patterns. To tackle the imbalance inherent in long-tailed data, we design\na dynamic rebalancing strategy that adjusts the sampling of underrepresented\ninstances throughout the pre-training process, ensuring better representation\nof tail classes. Moreover, Dual Reconstruction addresses simplicity bias by\nenforcing a reconstruction task aligned with the self-consistency principle,\nspecifically benefiting underrepresented tail classes.

    "abstract": "Splitting methods are widely used for solving initial value problems (IVPs)\ndue to their ability to simplify complicated evolutions into more manageable\nsubproblems which can be solved efficiently and accurately. Traditionally,\nthese methods are derived using analytic and algebraic techniques from\nnumerical analysis, including truncated Taylor series and their Lie algebraic\nanalogue, the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff formula. These tools enable the\ndevelopment of high-order numerical methods that provide exceptional accuracy\nfor small timesteps. Moreover, these methods often (nearly) conserve important\nphysical invariants, such as mass, unitarity, and energy. However, in many\npractical applications the computational resources are limited. Thus, it is\ncrucial to identify methods that achieve the best accuracy within a fixed\ncomputational budget, which might require taking relatively large timesteps. In\nthis regime, high-order methods derived with traditional methods often exhibit\nlarge errors since they are only designed to be asymptotically optimal. Machine\nLearning techniques offer a potential solution since they can be trained to\nefficiently solve a given IVP with less computational resources. However, they\nare often purely data-driven, come with limited convergence guarantees in the\nsmall-timestep regime and do not necessarily conserve physical invariants. In\nthis work, we propose a framework for finding machine learned splitting methods\nthat are computationally efficient for large timesteps and have provable\nconvergence and conservation guarantees in the small-timestep limit. We\ndemonstrate numerically that the learned methods, which by construction\nconverge quadratically in the timestep size, can be significantly more\nefficient than established methods for the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation if the\ncomputational budget is limited.",

    "abstract": "We present and discuss two catalogues of UV-selected (NUV $< 22.8$ mag)\ngalaxies that lie within a 200 deg$^2$ area of sky covered by the ASKAP FLASH\nsurvey and have an impact parameter of less than 20 arcsec to a FLASH radio\ncontinuum source. These catalogues are designed to enable a future search for\n21 cm HI absorption in and around star-forming galaxies at redshift $0.4<z<1$.\nWe outline the production of this UV-bright dataset, which has optical\nspectroscopy from the WiggleZ and SDSS surveys and a median redshift of\n$\\sim0.6$. Analysis of the optical spectra, using multiple diagnostic diagrams,\nshows that galaxies with an impact parameter of less than 5 arcsec are likely\nto be physically associated with the radio source and are five times more\nlikely to be an AGN than objects without a radio match. Conversely, objects\nwith impact factors between 5 and 20 arcsec are largely (>80 percent)\nstar-forming and resemble the overall WiggleZ population. The ($g - i$) colour\nevolution with redshift is consistent with a history of active star-formation,\nbut the radio-associated objects are typically redder and have colours similar\nto high-excitation radio galaxies. The redshift distribution of the two\ncatalogues matches the overall distribution for WiggleZ galaxies, despite their\notherwise rare radio properties. These catalogues can be expanded in future as\nnew radio data become available, and a forthcoming paper will present the HI\nabsorption results.",

These define an execution by the robot\nwith so-called satisfaction functions representing vague execution time\nrequirements. Such functions express a user's satisfaction over potential\nstarting times for skill execution. When the robot handles multiple fuzzy\nskills, the satisfaction function provides a temporal tolerance window for\nexecution, thus, enabling optimal scheduling based on satisfaction. We\ngeneralized such functions based on individual user expectations with a user\nstudy. The participants rated their satisfaction with an instruction's\nexecution at various times.

As we will show, and this seems to be\nquite atypical behavior when compared to some other geometric properties, to\nlift the Kadets--Klee properties from the components to whole direct sum it is\nnot enough to assume that all involved spaces have the appropriate Kadets--Klee\nproperty. Actually, to complete the picture one must add a dichotomy in the\nform of the Schur type properties for $X_{\\gamma}$'s supplemented by the\nvariant of strict monotonicity for $\\mathcal{E}$. Back down to earth, this\ngeneral machinery naturally provides a blue print for other topologies like,\nfor example, the weak topology or the topology of local convergence in measure,\nthat are perhaps more commonly associated with this type of considerations.\nFurthermore, by limiting ourselves to direct sums in which the family\n$\\mathcal{X}$ is constant, that is, $X_{\\gamma} = X$ for all $\\gamma \\in\n\\Gamma$ and some Banach space $X$, we return to the well-explored ground of\nK{\\\"o}the--Bochner sequence spaces $\\mathcal{E}(X)$.

Classical ISAC system considering\nmonostatic and/or bistatic settings will inevitably degrade both communication\nand sensing performance due to the limited service coverage and easily blocked\ntransmission paths. Besides, existing ISAC studies usually focus on downlink\n(DL) or uplink (UL) communication demands and unable to achieve the systematic\nDL and UL communication tasks. These challenges can be overcome by networked FD\nISAC framework. Moreover, ISAC generally considers the trade-off between\ncommunication and sensing, unavoidably leading to a loss in communication\nperformance.

In this paper, we utilize the MA to promote communication\ncapability with guaranteed sensing performance via jointly designing\nbeamforming, power allocation, receiving filters and MA configuration towards\nmaximizing sum rate. The optimization problem is highly difficult due to the\nunique channel model deriving from the MA.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces OpenLS-DGF, an adaptive logic synthesis dataset\ngeneration framework, to enhance machine learning~(ML) applications within the\nlogic synthesis process. Previous dataset generation flows were tailored for\nspecific tasks or lacked integrated machine learning capabilities. While\nOpenLS-DGF supports various machine learning tasks by encapsulating the three\nfundamental steps of logic synthesis: Boolean representation, logic\noptimization, and technology mapping. It preserves the original information in\nboth Verilog and machine-learning-friendly GraphML formats. The verilog files\noffer semi-customizable capabilities, enabling researchers to insert additional\nsteps and incrementally refine the generated dataset. Furthermore, OpenLS-DGF\nincludes an adaptive circuit engine that facilitates the final dataset\nmanagement and downstream tasks. The generated OpenLS-D-v1 dataset comprises 46\ncombinational designs from established benchmarks, totaling over 966,000\nBoolean circuits. OpenLS-D-v1 supports integrating new data features, making it\nmore versatile for new challenges. This paper demonstrates the versatility of\nOpenLS-D-v1 through four distinct downstream tasks: circuit classification,\ncircuit ranking, quality of results (QoR) prediction, and probability\nprediction. Each task is chosen to represent essential steps of logic\nsynthesis, and the experimental results show the generated dataset from\nOpenLS-DGF achieves prominent diversity and applicability.

However, a key challenge for ViTs is efficiently incorporating\nmulti-scale feature representations, which is inherent in convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) through their hierarchical structure. Graph transformers have\nmade strides in addressing this by leveraging graph-based modeling, but they\noften lose or insufficiently represent spatial hierarchies, especially since\nredundant or less relevant areas dilute the image's contextual representation.\nTo bridge this gap, we propose SAG-ViT, a Scale-Aware Graph Attention ViT that\nintegrates multi-scale feature capabilities of CNNs, representational power of\nViTs, graph-attended patching to enable richer contextual representation. Using\nEfficientNetV2 as a backbone, the model extracts multi-scale feature maps,\ndividing them into patches to preserve richer semantic information compared to\ndirectly patching the input images. The patches are structured into a graph\nusing spatial and feature similarities, where a Graph Attention Network (GAT)\nrefines the node embeddings. This refined graph representation is then\nprocessed by a Transformer encoder, capturing long-range dependencies and\ncomplex interactions. We evaluate SAG-ViT on benchmark datasets across various\ndomains, validating its effectiveness in advancing image classification tasks.\nOur code and weights are available at https://github.com/shravan-18/SAG-ViT.",

    "abstract": "We study potential contribution of the heavy right-handed neutrino exchange\nin the process $e^{+}e^{-} \\rightarrow W^{+}W^{-}$. This process is sensitive\nto heavy neutrinos with masses larger than $\\sqrt{s}$. The Monte Carlo\nsimulation of the studied process is performed assuming the Seesaw type-I\nmodel, where heavy right-handed neutrinos (heavy neutral leptons, HNL) are\nintroduced in the leptonic sector. Within the Standard Model (SM), the process\nhas a large cross section described by diagrams with $s$-channel $Z / \\gamma$\nexchange and $t$-channel active neutrino exchange. Respectively, the\n$t$-channel right-handed neutrino exchange amplitude will interfere with these\nSM amplitudes. However, the angular distributions of the $W$ boson production\nand decay are different for the right-handed neutrino and SM amplitudes. That\ncan be used to evaluate potential HNL contribution using the extended\nlikelihood method. The simulation of the $e^{+}e^{-} \\rightarrow W^{+}W^{-}$\nprocess is performed at the 1 TeV center-of-mass energy and polarisation\n$P_{e^+e^-}$ of (20 %, -80 %), which is a standard option for the future linear\n$e^+e^-$ collider ILC. Both $W$ bosons are reconstructed from two hadronic\njets. Simulation of the SM background processes is also done. The beam-induced\nbackgrounds and the initial state radiation (ISR) effects are taken into\naccount. The majority of background processes are effectively suppressed by the\ncuts on the invariant masses of two and four jets.

We monitored BD+00 444 with the HARPS-N spectrograph for 1.5 years to\nsearch for planet-induced radial-velocity (RV) variations, and then analyzed\nthe RV measurements jointly with TESS and ground-based photometry. We\ndetermined that the host is a quiet K5 V, and we revealed that the sub-Neptune\nBD+00 444 b has a radius of $R_b=2.36\\pm0.05 R_{\\oplus}$, a mass of\n$M_b=4.8\\pm1.1 M_{\\oplus}$ and, consequently, a rather low-density value of\n$\\rho_b=2.00+0.49-0.45$ g cm-3, which makes it compatible with both an\nEarth-like rocky interior with a thin H-He atmosphere and a half-rocky,\nhalf-water composition with a small amount of H-He.

    "abstract": "Strongly lensed type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide a unique cosmological\nprobe to address the Hubble tension problem in cosmology. In addition to the\nsensitivity of the time delays to the value of the Hubble constant, the\ntransient and standard candle nature of SNe Ia also enable valuable joint\nconstraints on the model of the lens and the cosmological parameters. The\nupcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with the Vera C. Rubin\nObservatory is expected to increase the number of observed SNe Ia by an order\nof magnitude in ten years of its lifetime. However, finding such systems in the\nLSST data is a challenge. In this work, we revisit the color-magnitude (CM)\ndiagram used previously as a means to identify lensed SNe Ia and extend the\nwork further as follows. We simulate LSST-like photometric data ($rizy$-bands)\nof lensed SNe Ia and analyze it in the CM parameter space. We find that a\nsubset of lensed SNe Ia are redder compared to unlensed SNe Ia at a given\nmagnitude, both in the rising and falling phases of their light curves and for\nSNe up to $z=3$. We propose a modified selection criterion based on these new\nresults. We show that the contamination coming from unlensed core-collapse (CC)\nSNe is negligible, whereas a small fraction of lensed CC SNe types Ib and Ic\nmay get selected by this criterion as potential lensed SNe. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that our criterion works well on a wide sample of observed unlensed\nSNe Ia, a handful of known multiply-imaged lensed SNe systems, and a\nrepresentative sample of observed CC SNe as well as super-luminous supernovae.",

    "abstract": "Estimating building height from satellite imagery poses significant\nchallenges, especially when monocular images are employed, resulting in a loss\nof essential 3D information during imaging. This loss of spatial depth further\ncomplicates the height estimation process. We addressed this issue by using\nshadow length as an additional cue to compensate for the loss of building\nheight estimation using single-view imagery. We proposed a novel method that\nfirst localized a building and its shadow in the given satellite image. After\nlocalization, the shadow length is estimated using a regression model. To\nestimate the final height of each building, we utilize the principles of\nphotogrammetry, specifically considering the relationship between the solar\nelevation angle, the vertical edge length of the building, and the length of\nthe building's shadow. For the localization of buildings in our model, we\nutilized a modified YOLOv7 detector, and to regress the shadow length for each\nbuilding we utilized the ResNet18 as backbone architecture. Finally, we\nestimated the associated building height using solar elevation with shadow\nlength through analytical formulation. We evaluated our method on 42 different\ncities and the results showed that the proposed framework surpasses the\nstate-of-the-art methods with a suitable margin.",

    "abstract": "Black holes, as characterized by the Hawking effect and Bekenstein-Hawking\nentropy, can be treated as a compact object carrying nontrivial quantum\ninformation obscured behind the event horizon. Thus, the black hole may convey\nand retract its quantum information to the nearby quantum probes via the\nsurrounding mediator fields. In this paper, we investigate the effects of a\nquantum black hole on the reduced states of a pair of static qubit-type\nUnruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors acting as a probe, using three complementary\nquantum information measures: concurrence characterizing entanglement\nharvesting, quantum discord, and Bell's nonlocality bound. This sheds light on\nthe nature of the quantum state of the black holes. By treating the black hole\nas a tidally deformable thermal body under the quantum fluctuation of the\nmediator fields as observed in \\cite{Goldberger:2019sya, goldberger2020virtual,\nbiggs2024comparing}, we employ a post-Newtonian effective field theory (PN-EFT)\nto derive the reduced states of the UDW probes analytically. Based on this, we\ncan easily obtain all three quantum information measures without encountering\nthe complicated Matsubara sum of infinite thermal poles, as in the conventional\napproach based on quantum fields in curved spacetime. By tuning the relative\nstrengths in the action of PN-EFT, we can extract the effects of the black hole\non the entanglement, quantum correlation, and nonlocality bound of the UDW\nprobe systems.

To reveal charge and spin redistribution during\nthese reactions the CAS(4,4) wave functions were analyzed using the orthogonal\nvalence bond method (OVB). The potential energy curves, different internal\ncoordinates, and the results of the OVB analysis show, that frequently the\naddition and elimination reactions follow different minimum energy paths,\nbecause they are indeed diabatic reactions. In these cases, there are no energy\nbarriers corresponding to saddle points on the potential energy surfaces but\nthe energy increases during one diabatic reaction until, at a certain point,\nthe system jumps to the other diabatic state and, in the following, the energy\ndecreases. This happens for reactions in $C_{2v}$ symmetry; as soon as the\nsystem can change to the lower symmetry, the diabatic states combine to an\nadiabatic one and the reaction follows a single minimum energy path.",

We propose a Lorentz-violating Yang-Mills\ntheory supplemented by a gauge-invariant mass term which generalizes the model\nin the Landau gauge.

Finally, we present a BRST-invariant\nformulation of the so-called Refined Gribov-Zwanziger action in the presence of\nLorentz-violating terms in linear covariant gauges and the underlying\ntree-level gauge-field propagator which is enriched by the non-perturbative\ninformation carried by the elimination of Gribov copies.",

However, in many scenarios, the focus of interest is on specific regions\nwithin the CV space. This paper introduces a novel \"sinking\" approach that\nenables enhanced sampling of arbitrary areas within the CV space. We begin by\nproposing a gridded convolutional approximation that productively replicates\nthe effects of metadynamics, a powerful CV-based enhanced sampling technique.\nBuilding on this, we present the SinkMeta method, which \"sinks\" the interior\nbias potential to create restraining potential \"cliffs\" at the grid edges.

Our experimental results demonstrate that SinkMeta requires minimal\nsampling steps to estimate the free energy landscape for CV subspaces of\nvarious shapes and dimensions, including irregular two-dimensional regions and\none-dimensional pathways between metastable states.

The proposed hidden feature learning method can\nsignificantly reduce the dimensionality and nonlinearity of the surrogate\nmodel, thereby improving modeling accuracy and generalization capability. To\ndemonstrate the efficiency of our proposed ideas, We conducted numerical\nexperiments on three popular surrogate models. The modeling results of typical\nhigh-dimensional mathematical cases and aerodynamic performance cases of ONERA\nM6 wings show that goal-oriented feature extraction significantly improves the\nmodeling accuracy. Goal-oriented feature extraction can effectively reduce the\nerror distribution of predicting cases and reduce the convergence and\nrobustness differences caused by various data-driven surrogate models.",

Built upon the existing direct numerical simulation\n(DNS) solver CaNS, CaLES relies on low-storage, third-order Runge-Kutta schemes\nfor temporal discretization, with the option to treat viscous terms via an\nimplicit Crank-Nicolson scheme in one or three directions. A fast direct\nsolver, based on eigenfunction expansions, is used to solve the discretized\nPoisson/Helmholtz equations. For turbulence modeling, the classical Smagorinsky\nmodel with van Driest near-wall damping and the dynamic Smagorinsky model are\nimplemented, along with a logarithmic law wall model. GPU acceleration is\nachieved through OpenACC directives, following CaNS-2.3.0. Performance\nassessments were conducted on the Leonardo cluster at CINECA, Italy. Each node\nis equipped with one Intel Xeon Platinum 8358 CPU (2.60 GHz, 32 cores) and four\nNVIDIA A100 GPUs (64 GB HBM2e), interconnected via NVLink 3.0 (200 GB/s). The\ninter-node communication bandwidth is 25 GB/s, supported by a DragonFly+\nnetwork architecture with NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand HDR. Results indicate that\nthe computational speed on a single GPU is equivalent to approximately 15 CPU\nnodes, depending on the treatment of viscous terms and the subgrid-scale model,\nand that the solver efficiently scales across multiple GPUs. The predictive\ncapability of CaLES has been tested using multiple flow cases, including\ndecaying isotropic turbulence, turbulent channel flow, and turbulent duct flow.\nThe high computational efficiency of the solver enables grid convergence\nstudies on extremely fine grids, pinpointing non-monotonic grid convergence for\nwall-modeled LES.",

To formulate the inverse problems we define a new type of\ndata, non-linear scattering functionals, which are defined also in the cases\nwhere the classically defined scattering operators are not well-defined. This\nmakes it possible to solve inverse problems also in cases where some of the\nincoming waves lead to a blow-up of the scattered solution. We use non-linear\ninteraction of waves as a beneficial tool that helps to solve the inverse\nproblem. The corresponding inverse problem for the linear wave equation still\nremains unsolved.",

    "abstract": "An aspect of interest in surveillance of diseases is whether the survival\ntime distribution changes over time. By following data in health registries\nover time, this can be monitored, either in real time or retrospectively. With\nrelevant risk factors registered, these can be taken into account in the\nmonitoring as well. A challenge in monitoring survival times based on registry\ndata is that the information related to cause of death might either be missing\nor uncertain. To quantify the burden of disease in such cases, relative\nsurvival methods can be used, where the total hazard is modelled as the\npopulation hazard plus the excess hazard due to the disease.\n  We propose a CUSUM procedure for monitoring for changes in the survival time\ndistribution in cases where use of excess hazard models is relevant. The CUSUM\nchart is based on a survival log-likelihood ratio and extends previously\nsuggested methods for monitoring of time to event data to the excess hazard\nsetting. The procedure takes into account changes in the population risk over\ntime, as well as changes in the excess hazard which is explained by observed\ncovariates. Properties, challenges and an application to cancer registry data\nwill be presented.",

This work proposes a discontinuous Galerkin method (DGM) whose\nperformance enhances with increasing data, for rapid simulation of transonic\nflow around airfoils under various flow conditions. A lightweight and\ncontinuously updated data-driven model is built offline to predict the roughly\ncorrect flow-field, and the DGM is then utilized to refine the detailed flow\nstructures and provide the corrected data. During the construction of the\ndata-driven model, a zonal proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is\ndesigned to reduce the dimensionality of flow-field while preserving more\nnear-wall flow features, and a weighted-distance radial basis function (RBF) is\nconstructed to enhance the generalization capability of flow-field prediction.\nNumerical results demonstrate that the lightweight data-driven model can\npredict the flow-field around a wide range of airfoils at Mach numbers ranging\nfrom 0.7 to 0.95 and angles of attack from -5 to 5 degrees by learning from\nsparse data, and maintains high accuracy of the location and essential features\nof flow structures (such as shock waves). In addition, the machine learning\n(ML) enhanced DGM is able to significantly improve the computational efficiency\nand simulation robustness as compared to normal DGMs in simulating transonic\ninviscid/viscous airfoil flow-fields on arbitrary grids, and further enables\nrapid aerodynamic evaluation of numerous sample points during the\nsurrogate-based aerodynamic optimization.",

    "abstract": "Starting with an $n$-dimensional oriented Riemannian manifold with a Spin-c\nstructure, we describe an elliptic system of equations which recover the\nSeiberg-Witten equations when $n=3,4$. The equations are for a U(1)-connection\n$A$ and spinor $\\phi$, as usual, and also an odd degree form $\\beta$ (generally\nof inhomogeneous degree). From $A$ and $\\beta$ we define a Dirac operator\n$D_{A,\\beta}$ using the action of $\\beta$ and $*\\beta$ on spinors (with\ncarefully chosen coefficients) to modify $D_A$. The first equation in our\nsystem is $D_{A,\\beta}(\\phi)=0$. The left-hand side of the second equation is\nthe principal part of the Weitzenb\\\"ock remainder for\n$D^*_{A,\\beta}D_{A,\\beta}$. The equation sets this equal to $q(\\phi)$, the\ntrace-free part of projection against $\\phi$, as is familiar from the cases\n$n=3,4$. In dimensions $n=4m$ and $n=2m+1$, this gives an elliptic system\nmodulo gauge. To obtain a system which is elliptic modulo gauge in dimensions\n$n=4m+2$, we use two spinors and two connections, and so have two Dirac and two\ncurvature equations, that are then coupled via the form $\\beta$. We also prove\na collection of a priori estimates for solutions to these equations.\nUnfortunately they are not sufficient to prove compactness modulo gauge,\ninstead leaving the possibility that bubbling may occur.",

    "abstract": "The alignment of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for generating\nhelpful and harmless content. Existing approaches leverage preference-based\nhuman feedback data to learn the reward function and align the LLM with the\nfeedback data. However, these approaches focus on modeling the reward\ndifference between the chosen and rejected demonstrations, rather than directly\nmodeling the true reward from each demonstration. Moreover, these approaches\nassume that the reward is only obtained at the end of the sentence, which\noverlooks the modeling of intermediate rewards. These issues lead to\ninsufficient use of training signals in the feedback data, limiting the\nrepresentation and generalization ability of the reward and potentially\nresulting in reward hacking. In this paper, we formulate LLM alignment as a\nBayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning (BIRL) problem and propose a novel\ntraining objective, Approximated Variational Alignment (AVA), to perform LLM\nalignment through Approximated Variational Reward Imitation Learning (AVRIL).\nThe BIRL formulation facilitates intermediate reward modeling and direct reward\nmodeling on each single demonstration, which enhances the utilization of\ntraining signals in the feedback data. Experiments show that AVA outperforms\nexisting LLM alignment approaches in reward modeling, RL fine-tuning, and\ndirect optimization.",

It is known that the weak-type $(1,1)$ constant of $\\Lambda_0$ is\nequal to $1/\\ln(2)\\approx 1.44$. We construct examples showing that the\nweak-type $(1,1)$ constant of $\\Lambda_1$ is larger than $1.38$ and that the\nweak-type $(1,1)$ constant of $\\Lambda_m$ does not tend to $1$ when\n$m\\to\\infty$. This disproves a conjecture of Gill [Mich. Math. J. 59 (2010),\nNo. 2, 353-363].

    "abstract": "With the increasing implementation of machine learning models on edge or\nInternet-of-Things (IoT) devices, deploying advanced models on\nresource-constrained IoT devices remains challenging. Transformer models, a\ncurrently dominant neural architecture, have achieved great success in broad\ndomains but their complexity hinders its deployment on IoT devices with limited\ncomputation capability and storage size. Although many model compression\napproaches have been explored, they often suffer from notorious performance\ndegradation. To address this issue, we introduce a new method, namely\nTransformer Re-parameterization, to boost the performance of lightweight\nTransformer models. It consists of two processes: the High-Rank Factorization\n(HRF) process in the training stage and the deHigh-Rank Factorization (deHRF)\nprocess in the inference stage. In the former process, we insert an additional\nlinear layer before the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the lightweight\nTransformer. It is supposed that the inserted HRF layers can enhance the model\nlearning capability. In the later process, the auxiliary HRF layer will be\nmerged together with the following FFN layer into one linear layer and thus\nrecover the original structure of the lightweight model. To examine the\neffectiveness of the proposed method, we evaluate it on three widely used\nTransformer variants, i.e., ConvTransformer, Conformer, and SpeechFormer\nnetworks, in the application of speech emotion recognition on the IEMOCAP, M3ED\nand DAIC-WOZ datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method\nconsistently improves the performance of lightweight Transformers, even making\nthem comparable to large models. The proposed re-parameterization approach\nenables advanced Transformer models to be deployed on resource-constrained IoT\ndevices.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Chromodynamics predicts a phase transition from ordinary hadronic\nmatter to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at high temperatures and energy\ndensities, where quarks and gluons (partons) are not confined within hadrons.\nThe QGP is generated in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Anisotropic\nflow coefficients, quantifying the anisotropic azimuthal expansion of the\nproduced matter, provide a unique tool to unravel QGP properties. Flow\nmeasurements in high-energy heavy-ion collisions show a distinctive grouping of\nanisotropic flow for baryons and mesons at intermediate transverse momentum, a\nfeature associated with flow being imparted at the quark level, confirming the\nexistence of the QGP. The observation of QGP-like features in relativistic\nproton-proton and proton-ion collisions has sparked debate about possible QGP\nformation in smaller collision systems, which remains unresolved. In this\narticle, we demonstrate for the first time the distinctive grouping of\nanisotropic flow for baryons and mesons in high-multiplicity proton-lead and\nproton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These results are\ndescribed by a model that includes hydrodynamic flow followed by hadron\nformation via quark coalescence, replicating features observed in heavy-ion\ncollisions. This observation is consistent with the formation of a partonic\nflowing system in proton-proton and proton-lead collisions at the LHC.",

According to counterfactual\nthinking, how would user preferences and query match change for items if we\nremoved their query-related features in search, we leverage search queries to\nconstruct counterfactual signals to disentangle item representations, isolating\nonly query-independent general features.

Iterative methods compared\nto the standard Feldkamp algorithm have shown improvements in image quality of\nreconstruction of low-dose acquired data despite their long computing time. An\ninteresting aspect of iterative methods is their ability to include prior\ninformation such as sparsity-constraint. While a large panel of optimization\nalgorithms along with their adaptation to tomographic problems are available,\nthey are mainly studied on 2D parallel or fan-beam data. The issues raised by\n3D CBCT and moreover by truncated projections are still poorly understood.\nApproach. We compare different carefully designed optimization schemes in the\ncontext of realistic 3D dental imaging. Besides some known algorithms, SIRT-TV\nand MLEM, we investigate the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) approach and a\nnewly proposed MLEM-TV optimizer. The last one is alternating EM steps and\nTV-denoising, combination not yet investigated for CBCT. Experiments are\nperformed on both simulated data from a 3D jaw phantom and data acquired with a\ndental clinical scanner. Main results. With some adaptations to the\nspecificities of CBCT operators, PDHG and MLEM-TV algorithms provide the best\nreconstruction quality. These results were obtained by comparing the full-dose\nimage with a low-dose image and an ultra low-dose image. Significance. The\nconvergence speed of the original iterative methods is hampered by the conical\ngeometry and significantly reduced compared to parallel geometries. We promote\nthe pre-conditioned version of PDHG and we propose a pre-conditioned version of\nthe MLEM-TV algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time\nPDHG and convergent MLEM-TV algorithms are evaluated on experimental dental\nCBCT data, where constraints such as projection truncation and presence of\nmetal have to be jointly overcome.",

In this paper, we present an alternative method by directly\nusing the time-domain GW signal detected by space GW detectors to constrain the\nanisotropic structure of the Galaxy. The information of anisotropic\ndistribution of DWDs is naturally encoded in the time-domain GW signal because\nof the variation of the detectors' directions and consequently the pattern\nfunctions due to their annual motion around the sun.

To study and quantify the sharpness of different local\nminima, this paper presents two analysis methods: gradient ascent and reduced\nHessian eigenvalue analysis. The results show that white-box adversarial\nattacks significantly improve generalization performance, albeit with increased\ncomputational complexity.",

Consequently, these methods\nstruggle to produce a unified and meaningful representation from the input\nface. We suppose that introducing the language-vision pluralistic\nrepresentation into unexplored potential embedding space could enhance FSR by\nencoding and exploiting the complementarity across language-vision prior. This\nmotivates us to propose a new framework called LLV-FSR, which marries the power\nof large vision-language model and higher-order visual prior with the\nchallenging task of FSR. Specifically, besides directly absorbing knowledge\nfrom original input, we introduce the pre-trained vision-language model to\ngenerate pluralistic priors, involving the image caption, descriptions, face\nsemantic mask and depths. These priors are then employed to guide the more\ncritical feature representation, facilitating realistic and high-quality face\nsuper-resolution. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework\nsignificantly improves both the reconstruction quality and perceptual quality,\nsurpassing the SOTA by 0.43dB in terms of PSNR on the MMCelebA-HQ dataset.",

Comparative simulations performed with the model reveal\nsignificant differences in flexibility and cost-effectiveness, driven by\nfactors such as production capacity, downstream process demand, storage\ncapacity, and operational constraints. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis\nfurther clarifies the impact of various parameters on production optimization\nand flexibility savings.

    "abstract": "When a binary of early-type stars from the young stellar populations in the\nGalactic center (GC) region is scattered to the vicinity of the supermassive\nblack hole (SMBH) Sgr~$\\rm{A}^{*}$, one of the components would be tidally\nejected as an early-type hypervelocity star (HVS) and the counterpart would be\ncaptured on a tight orbit around Sgr~$\\rm{A}^{*}$. Dozens of B-type HVSs moving\nfaster than the Galactic escape speed have been discovered in the Galactic halo\nand are produced most likely by the SMBH Sgr~$\\rm{A}^{*}$. However, the\nvelocity distribution and in particular the deficit of the HVSs above $700\\,\n\\rm{km\\, s^{-1}}$ is seriously inconsistent with the expectations of the\npresent models. Here we show that the high-velocity deficit is due to the\ndeficiency in close interactions of stars with the SMBH Sgr~$\\rm{A}^{*}$,\nbecause an orbiting intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) of about 15,000 Solar\nmass kicked away slowly approaching stars 50--250 million years ago. The\nSMBH-IMBH binary formed probably after the merger of the Milky Way with the\nGaia-Sausage-Enceladus dwarf galaxy, and coalesced about 10 million years ago,\nleading to a gravitational recoil of Sgr~$\\rm{A}^{*}$ at a velocity of\n0.3--0.5$\\, \\rm{km\\, s^{-1}}$ and to a change of the HVS ejection scenarios.\nThe SMBH-IMBH binary scenario predicts the formation of the S-star cluster at\nthe GC with the distribution of the orbital size and stellar ages that are well\nconsistent with the observations.",

We propose the Pkd-tree\n(Parallel $k$d-tree), a parallel $k$d-tree that is efficient both in theory and\nin practice. The Pkd-tree supports parallel tree construction, batch update\n(insertion and deletion), and various queries including k-nearest neighbor\nsearch, range query, and range count. We proved that our algorithms have strong\ntheoretical bounds in work (sequential time complexity), span (parallelism),\nand cache complexity. Our key techniques include 1) an efficient construction\nalgorithm that optimizes work, span, and cache complexity simultaneously, and\n2) reconstruction-based update algorithms that guarantee the tree to be\nweight-balanced. With the new algorithmic insights and careful engineering\neffort, we achieved a highly optimized implementation of the Pkd-tree.\n  We tested Pkd-tree with various synthetic and real-world datasets, including\nboth uniform and highly skewed data.

After the removal of gas from the disk, the\nembryos experience mutual giant impacts which, together with the accretion of\nadditional planetesimals, lead to the formation of the terrestrial planets on a\ntimescale of tens of millions of years. In the alternative, pebble accretion\nscenario, the terrestrial planets grow by accreting sunward-drifting mm-cm\nsized particles from the outer disk. The planets all form within the lifetime\nof the disk, with the sole exception of Earth, which undergoes a single\npost-disk giant impact with Theia (a fifth protoplanet formed by pebble\naccretion itself) to form the Moon. To distinguish between these two scenarios,\nwe revisit all available constraints: compositional (in terms of\nnucleosynthetic isotope anomalies and chemical composition), dynamical and\nchronological.

However, the interpretability of why and how this\ntechnique works remains unclear. In this work, we reinterpret weight-averaged\nmodel merging through the lens of interpretability and provide empirical\ninsights into the underlying mechanisms that govern its behavior. We approach\nthe problem from three perspectives: (1) we analyze the learned weight\nstructures and demonstrate that model weights encode structured representations\nthat help explain the compatibility of weight averaging; (2) we compare\naveraging in weight space and feature space across diverse model architectures\n(CNNs and ViTs) and datasets, aiming to expose under which circumstances what\ncombination paradigm will work more effectively; (3) we study the effect of\nparameter scaling on prediction stability, highlighting how weight averaging\nacts as a form of regularization that contributes to robustness.

In our experiments, we developed a\nCALM to enhance the financial performance of an LLM with strong response\ncapabilities by leveraging a financial-specialized LLM. Notably, the CALM was\ntrained using a financial dataset different from the one used to train the\nfinancial-specialized LLM, confirming CALM's ability to adapt to various\ndatasets. The models were evaluated through quantitative Japanese financial\nbenchmarks and qualitative response comparisons, demonstrating that CALM\nenables superior responses with higher scores than the original models and\nbaselines. Additionally, comparative experiments on connection points revealed\nthat connecting the middle layers of the models is most effective in\nfacilitating adaptation to the financial domain. These findings confirm that\nCALM is a practical approach for adapting LLMs to the financial domain.",

    "abstract": "We reanalyze the spectral lag data for GRB 160625B using frequentist\ninference in order to constrain the energy scale ($E_{QG}$) of Lorentz\nInvariance Violation (LIV). For this purpose, we use profile likelihood to deal\nwith the astrophysical nuisance parameters. This is in contrast to Bayesian\ninference implemented in previous works, where marginalization was carried out\nover the nuisance parameters. We show that with profile likelihood, we do not\nfind a global minimum for $\\chi^2$ as a function of $E_{QG}$ below the Planck\nscale for both linear and quadratic models of LIV, whereas bounded credible\nintervals were previously obtained using Bayesian inference. Therefore, we can\nset one-sided lower limits in a straightforward manner. We find that $E_{QG}\n\\geq 2.55 \\times 10^{16}$ GeV and $E_{QG} \\geq 1.85 \\times 10^7$ GeV at 95\\%\nc.l., for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively.

    "abstract": "Solving multiscale diffusion problems is often computationally expensive due\nto the spatial and temporal discretization challenges arising from\nhigh-contrast coefficients. To address this issue, a partially explicit\ntemporal splitting scheme is proposed. By appropriately constructing multiscale\nspaces, the spatial multiscale property is effectively managed, and it has been\ndemonstrated that the temporal step size is independent of the contrast. To\nenhance simulation speed, we propose a parallel algorithm for the multiscale\nflow problem that leverages the partially explicit temporal splitting scheme.\nThe idea is first to evolve the partially explicit system using a coarse time\nstep size, then correct the solution on each coarse time interval with a fine\npropagator, for which we consider both the sequential solver and all-at-once\nsolver. This procedure is then performed iteratively till convergence. We\nanalyze the stability and convergence of the proposed algorithm. The numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves high numerical\naccuracy for high-contrast problems and converges in a relatively small number\nof iterations. The number of iterations stays stable as the number of coarse\nintervals increases, thus significantly improving computational efficiency\nthrough parallel processing.",

It was found that\nextreme rainfall events were more frequent during the winter and pre-monsoon\nseasons in the even cycles, whereas in the odd cycles, they were more prevalent\nduring the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. These findings are presented for\nthe first time and may offer new perspectives on how different phases affect\nrainfall. This study suggests a physical link between solar activity and\nextreme precipitation in Kerala, which could increase predictability.",

Building upon the original grid\nvelocity-space discretization, we derive and implement a new spectral\nformulation and verify the numerical implementation using the method of\nmanufactured solution. We conduct a series of spectral turbulence simulations\nfocusing on the TCV-X21 reference case [Oliveira D. S. et al., Nucl. Fusion 62,\n096001 (2022)] and compare these results with previously validated grid\nsimulations [Ulbl P. et al., Phys. Plasmas 30, 107986 (2023)]. The spectral\napproach reproduces the outboard midplane (OMP) profiles (density, temperature,\nand radial electric field), dominated by trapped electron mode (TEM)\nturbulence, with excellent agreement and significantly lower velocity-space\nresolution. Thus, the spectral approach reduces the computational cost by at\nleast an order of magnitude, achieving a speed-up of approximately 50 for the\nTCV-X21 case. This enables high-fidelity GK simulations to be performed within\na few days on modern CPU-based supercomputers for medium-sized devices and\nestablishes GENE-X as a powerful tool for studying edge and SOL turbulence,\nmoving towards reactor-relevant devices like ITER.",

Although many\nauthentication and key agreement schemes exist, they often face limitations,\nsuch as being tailored to overly specific scenarios where devices authenticate\nsolely with either the edge or the cloud, or being unsuitable for\nresource-constrained devices. To address these challenges, we propose an\nadaptive and efficient authentication and key agreement scheme (AEAKA) for\nCloud-Edge-Device IoT environments. This scheme is highly adaptive and\nscalable, capable of automatically and dynamically initiating different\nauthentication methods based on device requirements. Additionally, it employs\nan edge-assisted authentication approach to reduce the load on third-party\ntrust authorities. Furthermore, we introduce a hash-based algorithm for the\nauthentication protocol, ensuring a lightweight method suitable for a wide\nrange of resource-constrained devices while maintaining security. AEAKA ensures\nthat entities use associated authentication credentials, enhancing the privacy\nof the authentication process. Security proofs and performance analyses\ndemonstrate that AEAKA outperforms other methods in terms of security and\nauthentication efficiency.",

    "abstract": "While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has advanced\nopen-vocabulary predictions, its performance on semantic segmentation remains\nsuboptimal. This shortfall primarily stems from its spatial-invariant semantic\nfeatures and constrained resolution. While previous adaptations addressed\nspatial invariance semantic by modifying the self-attention in CLIP's image\nencoder, the issue of limited resolution remains unexplored. Different from\nprevious segment-then-splice methods that segment sub-images via a sliding\nwindow and splice the results, we introduce a splice-then-segment paradigm that\nincorporates Segment-Anything Model (SAM) to tackle the resolution issue since\nSAM excels at extracting fine-grained semantic correlations from\nhigh-resolution images. Specifically, we introduce Trident, a training-free\nframework that first splices features extracted by CLIP and DINO from\nsub-images, then leverages SAM's encoder to create a correlation matrix for\nglobal aggregation, enabling a broadened receptive field for effective\nsegmentation. Besides, we propose a refinement strategy for CLIP's coarse\nsegmentation outputs by transforming them into prompts for SAM, further\nenhancing the segmentation performance. Trident achieves a significant\nimprovement in the mIoU across eight benchmarks compared with the current SOTA,\nincreasing from 44.4 to 48.6.Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/YuHengsss/Trident.",

Recent research has identified new classes of \"machine\nun-auditable\" bugs that arise from both transactional contexts and source code.\nExisting detection methods require human understanding of underlying\ntransaction logic and manual reasoning across different sources of context\n(i.e. modalities), such as code, dynamic transaction executions, and natural\nlanguage specifying the expected transaction behavior.\n  To automate the detection of ``machine un-auditable'' bugs, we present\nSmartInv, an accurate and fast smart contract invariant inference framework.\nOur key insight is that the expected behavior of smart contracts, as specified\nby invariants, relies on understanding and reasoning across multimodal\ninformation, such as source code and natural language. We propose a new\nprompting strategy to foundation models, Tier of Thought (ToT), to reason\nacross multiple modalities of smart contracts and ultimately to generate\ninvariants.

In this paper, we propose JoyVASA, a diffusion-based method for\ngenerating facial dynamics and head motion in audio-driven facial animation.\nSpecifically, in the first stage, we introduce a decoupled facial\nrepresentation framework that separates dynamic facial expressions from static\n3D facial representations. This decoupling allows the system to generate longer\nvideos by combining any static 3D facial representation with dynamic motion\nsequences. Then, in the second stage, a diffusion transformer is trained to\ngenerate motion sequences directly from audio cues, independent of character\nidentity. Finally, a generator trained in the first stage uses the 3D facial\nrepresentation and the generated motion sequences as inputs to render\nhigh-quality animations. With the decoupled facial representation and the\nidentity-independent motion generation process, JoyVASA extends beyond human\nportraits to animate animal faces seamlessly. The model is trained on a hybrid\ndataset of private Chinese and public English data, enabling multilingual\nsupport.

Traditional single-sensor approaches are\ninadequate for capturing multi-point vibrations. Existing contact-based\nsolutions, while addressing this need, can cause discomfort and skin allergies,\nwhereas noncontact optical and acoustic methods are highly susceptible to light\ninterference and environmental noise. In this paper, we aim to develop a\nnon-contact, multi-point vital sign monitoring technique using MIMO radar,\nfocused on physically differentiating and precisely measuring chest-wall\nsurface vibrations at multiple points induced by cardiopulmonary mechanical\nactivity. The primary challenges in developing such a technique involve\ndeveloping algorithms to extract and separate entangled signals, as well as\nestablishing a reliable method for validating detection accuracy. To address\nthese limitations, we introduce MultiVital, a wireless system that leverages\nmmWave Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) radar for synchronous multi-point\nvital sign monitoring. It integrates two reference modalities: five-channel\nseismocardiography (SCG) sensors and a one-channel electrocardiogram (ECG)\nelectrode, enabling comprehensive radar-based research and performance\nvalidation across multiple physiological metrics. Additionally, we have\ndeveloped a multi-modal signal processing framework, consisting of a radar\nsignal processing module, an SCG calibration module, and a spatial alignment\nscheme. To evaluate the radar signal processing module, we conducted\nmathematical derivation and simulation.

A major challenge in underwater 3D imaging is the high cost\nof the planar arrays and the computational complexity of the image\nreconstruction algorithms. In this work, we introduce two novel aspects, an L\nshaped array and a quadrant based time domain receive beamforming with a focus\non achieving relatively low computational complexity for real-time 3D imaging\nin underwater environments. An orthogonal combination of two linear arrays to\nform an L shape is used to perform two independent and parallel 2D delay and\nsum beamforming and the 3D image of the target is reconstructed using the\nproduct of the resulting beams. In the proposed quadrant-based beamforming,\neach quadrant in the imaging slice is reconstructed in parallel using the\northogonal L-shaped linear arrays which reside at the edges of the planar array\nfor the quadrant to be reconstructed. The proposed L-array solves the\nmultiple-target ambiguity issue of the cross-array and an L-array placed at the\ncenter of the uniform planar array. The proposed method has reduced the main\nlobe width by 1 degree with 11.8 dB increase in the peak side lobe level when\ncompared to the conventional delay and sum beamforming using a uniform planar\narray. Although there is an increase in the side lobe level, the asymmetric\nbeam pattern of the proposed L array and the quadrant-based beamforming\nrestrict the side lobes within a quadrant. The proposed method achieves a\nreduction in computation time by a factor of 97 for 3D imaging compared to the\nconventional method, while maintaining acceptable image quality.

The OBS model is the sum of terms that have direct counterparts\nin the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian, each of which is parameterized by a\ncoupling constant. Exact diagonalization reveals that the energy spectrum and\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of the OBS model are essentially the same as that of\nthe dice lattice for some values of the coupling constants.

Due to the noisy and biased nature of implicit real-world\nuser-item interactions, identifying and rectifying noisy interactions are vital\nto enhance model performance and robustness. Previous works on purifying\nuser-item interactions in collaborative filtering mainly focus on mining the\ncorrelation between user/item embeddings and noisy interactions, neglecting the\nbenefit of temporal patterns in determining noisy interactions. Time\ninformation, while enhancing the model utility, also bears its natural\nadvantage in helping to determine noisy edges, e.g., if someone usually watches\nhorror movies at night and talk shows in the morning, a record of watching a\nhorror movie in the morning is more likely to be noisy interaction. Armed with\nthis observation, we introduce a simple yet effective mechanism for generating\ntime-aware user/item embeddings and propose two strategies for denoising\nbipartite temporal graph in recommender systems (DeBaTeR): the first is through\nreweighting the adjacency matrix (DeBaTeR-A), where a reliability score is\ndefined to reweight the edges through both soft assignment and hard assignment;\nthe second is through reweighting the loss function (DeBaTeR-L), where weights\nare generated to reweight user-item samples in the losses.

While in transport, high-$Z$\nsolar energetic particles (SEPs) with energies of $\\sim$1 MeV/nuc leave damage\ntracks as they pass through IDPs. SEP track densities can be used as a measure\nof a grain's space exposure and in turn, help to constrain their lifetimes and\norigins. Stratospherically collected IDPs with relatively high track densities\n($>10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$) have been interpreted as originating from the\nEdgeworth-Kuiper Belt. To further test this hypothesis, we use a dynamical dust\ngrain tracing model to explore the accumulation of SEP tracks within EKB dust\ngrains. We demonstrate that, neglecting collisions, dust grains with radii up\nto 500 $\\mu$m are capable of transiting from the EKB to 1 au despite\ngravitational perturbations from the outer planets, albeit with decreasing\nprobability as a function of size. Despite this, we find that EKB grains cannot\naccumulate sufficient tracks to match those reported in the terrestrial\nstratospheric IDP collection when applying SEP track accumulation rates\nestablished from lunar samples at 1 au and assuming the SEP flux scales with\nheliocentric distance as $r^{-1.7}$. By exploring the radial scaling of the SEP\nflux, we find that a shallower SEP radial distribution of $r^{-1.0}$ does allow\nfor the accumulation of $>$$10^{10}$ tracks cm$^{-2}$ in EKB dust grains that\nreach 1 au. We urge further research into the propagation and distribution of\nhigh-$Z$ SEPs throughout the heliosphere in order to better constrain track\naccumulation in IDPs.",

The numerical results indicate\nthat our neural networks generally achieve better performance than traditional\nneural networks while using fewer parameters.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in image generation, particularly via diffusion models, have\nled to impressive improvements in image synthesis quality. Despite this,\ndiffusion models are still challenged by model-induced artifacts and limited\nstability in image fidelity. In this work, we hypothesize that the primary\ncause of this issue is the improper resampling operation that introduces\naliasing in the diffusion model and a careful alias-free resampling dictated by\nimage processing theory can improve the model's performance in image synthesis.\nWe propose the integration of alias-free resampling layers into the UNet\narchitecture of diffusion models without adding extra trainable parameters,\nthereby maintaining computational efficiency. We then assess whether these\ntheory-driven modifications enhance image quality and rotational equivariance.\nOur experimental results on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, MNIST, and\nMNIST-M, reveal consistent gains in image quality, particularly in terms of FID\nand KID scores. Furthermore, we propose a modified diffusion process that\nenables user-controlled rotation of generated images without requiring\nadditional training. Our findings highlight the potential of theory-driven\nenhancements such as alias-free resampling in generative models to improve\nimage quality while maintaining model efficiency and pioneer future research\ndirections to incorporate them into video-generating diffusion models, enabling\ndeeper exploration of the applications of alias-free resampling in generative\nmodeling.",

Psychological factors have so\nfar played a minor role in collective-intelligence studies because the\nprinciples are often general and applicable to agents without sophisticated\npsychologies. We emphasise, with examples from other complex adaptive systems,\nthe broad applicability of collective-intelligence principles, while noting\nthat mechanisms and time scales differ markedly between cases. We review\nevidence that flexible collective intelligence in human social settings is\nimproved by a particular cognitive tool: our Theory of Mind.

To make this case, we step\nback from the algorithmic basis of AI psychology and consider the large-scale\nimpact AI can have as agential actors in a 'social ecology' rather than as mere\ntechnological tools. We identify several key characteristics of psychologically\nmediated collective intelligence and show that the development of a Theory of\nMind is crucial in distinguishing human social collective intelligence from\nmore general forms. Finally, we illustrate how individuals, human or otherwise,\nintegrate within a collective not by being genetically or algorithmically\nprogrammed, but by growing and adapting into the socio-cognitive niche they\noccupy.

Previous works often rely on distinguishing\nsynthesizer artifacts to identify deepfake speech. However, excessive reliance\non these specific synthesizer artifacts may result in unsatisfactory\nperformance when addressing speech signals created by unseen synthesizers. In\nthis paper, we propose a robust deepfake speech detection method that employs\nfeature decomposition to learn synthesizer-independent content features as\ncomplementary for detection. Specifically, we propose a dual-stream feature\ndecomposition learning strategy that decomposes the learned speech\nrepresentation using a synthesizer stream and a content stream. The synthesizer\nstream specializes in learning synthesizer features through supervised training\nwith synthesizer labels. Meanwhile, the content stream focuses on learning\nsynthesizer-independent content features, enabled by a pseudo-labeling-based\nsupervised learning method. This method randomly transforms speech to generate\nspeed and compression labels for training. Additionally, we employ an\nadversarial learning technique to reduce the synthesizer-related components in\nthe content stream. The final classification is determined by concatenating the\nsynthesizer and content features. To enhance the model's robustness to\ndifferent synthesizer characteristics, we further propose a synthesizer feature\naugmentation strategy that randomly blends the characteristic styles within\nreal and fake audio features and randomly shuffles the synthesizer features\nwith the content features.

To combat these inefficiencies, we develop a novel\nasymptotic-preserving scheme that is uniformly consistent and stable for all\nMach regimes. The proposed method for a single pipeline follows the flux\nsplitting suggested in [Haack et al., Commun. Comput. Phys., 12 (2012), pp.\n955--980], in which the flux is separated into stiff and non-stiff portions\nthen discretized in time using an implicit-explicit approach. The non-stiff\npart is advanced in time by an explicit hyperbolic solver; we opt for the\nsecond-order central-upwind finite volume scheme. The stiff portion is advanced\nin time implicitly using an approach based on Rosenbrock-type Runge-Kutta\nmethods, which ultimately reduces this implicit stage to a discretization of a\nlinear elliptic equation.\n  To extend to full pipe networks, the scheme on a single pipeline is paired\nwith coupling conditions defined at pipe-to-pipe intersections to ensure a\nmathematically well-posed problem. We show that the coupling conditions remain\nwell-posed in the low Mach/high friction limit -- which, when used to define\nthe ghost cells of each pipeline, results in a method that is accurate across\nthese intersections in all regimes.

    "abstract": "The observation of a Hall effect, a finite transverse voltage induced by a\nlongitudinal current, usually requires the breaking of time-reversal symmetry,\nfor example through the application of an external magnetic field or the\npresence of long range magnetic order in a sample. Recently it was suggested\nthat under certain symmetry conditions, the presence of finite Berry curvatures\nin the band structure of a system with time-reversal symmetry but without\ninversion symmetry can give rise to a nonlinear Hall effect in the presence of\na probe current. In order to observe the nonlinear Hall effect, one requires a\nfinite component of a so-called Berry dipole along the direction of the probe\ncurrent. We report here measurements of the nonlinear Hall effect in\ntwo-dimensional electron gases fabricated on the surface of KTaO$_3$ with\ndifferent surface crystal orientations as a function of the probe current, a\ntransverse electric field and back gate voltage. For all three crystal\norientations, the transverse electric field modifies the nonlinear Hall effect.\nWe discuss our results in the context of the current understanding of the\nnonlinear Hall effect as well as potential experimental artifacts that may give\nrise to the same effects.",

Traditional reinforcement\nlearning (RL) is learning from interaction based on the feedback rewards of the\nenvironment. However, in real scenarios, the rewards are generated by agents'\ninnate value systems, which differ vastly from individuals based on their needs\nand requirements. In other words, considering the AI agent as a self-organizing\nsystem, developing its awareness through balancing internal and external\nutilities based on its needs in different tasks is a crucial problem for\nindividuals learning to support others and integrate community with safety and\nharmony in the long term. To address this gap, we propose a new RL model termed\ninnate-values-driven RL (IVRL) based on combined motivations' models and\nexpected utility theory to mimic its complex behaviors in the evolution through\ndecision-making and learning.

The scale of DNN\nmodels, the diversity of PIM accelerators, and the complexity of deployment are\nfar beyond the human deployment capability.

In this work, we propose PIMCOMP, an end-to-end\nDNN compiler tailored for PIM accelerators, achieving efficient deployment of\nDNN models on PIM hardware. PIMCOMP can adapt to various PIM architectures by\nusing an abstract configurable PIM accelerator template with a set of\npseudo-instructions, which is a high-level abstraction of the hardware's\nfundamental functionalities. Through a generic multi-level optimization\nframework, PIMCOMP realizes an end-to-end conversion from a high-level DNN\ndescription to pseudo-instructions, which can be further converted to specific\nhardware intrinsics/primitives. The compilation addresses two critical issues\nin PIM-accelerated inference from a system perspective: resource utilization\nand dataflow scheduling. PIMCOMP adopts a flexible unfolding format to reshape\nand partition convolutional layers, adopts a weight-layout guided\ncomputation-storage-mapping approach to enhance resource utilization, and\nbalances the system's computation, memory access, and communication\ncharacteristics. For dataflow scheduling, we design two scheduling algorithms\nwith different inter-layer pipeline granularities to support varying\napplication scenarios while ensuring high computational parallelism.\nExperiments demonstrate that PIMCOMP improves throughput, latency, and energy\nefficiency across various architectures.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which lead to\nhigh-quality novel view synthesis and accelerated rendering, have remarkably\nimproved the quality of radiance field reconstruction. However, the extraction\nof mesh from a massive number of minute 3D Gaussian points remains great\nchallenge due to the large volume of Gaussians and difficulty of representation\nof sharp signals caused by their inherent low-pass characteristics. To address\nthis issue, we propose DyGASR, which utilizes generalized exponential function\ninstead of traditional 3D Gaussian to decrease the number of particles and\ndynamically optimize the representation of the captured signal. In addition, it\nis observed that reconstructing mesh with Generalized Exponential\nSplatting(GES) without modifications frequently leads to failures since the\ngeneralized exponential distribution centroids may not precisely align with the\nscene surface. To overcome this, we adopt Sugar's approach and introduce\nGeneralized Surface Regularization (GSR), which reduces the smallest scaling\nvector of each point cloud to zero and ensures normal alignment perpendicular\nto the surface, facilitating subsequent Poisson surface mesh reconstruction.\nAdditionally, we propose a dynamic resolution adjustment strategy that utilizes\na cosine schedule to gradually increase image resolution from low to high\nduring the training stage, thus avoiding constant full resolution, which\nsignificantly boosts the reconstruction speed.

Nonetheless, the intrinsic\ninformation content (estimated by, e.g., the number of parameters or the\ncomplexity of ontic embedding) indicates that defining an $n$-qubit system\noften requires information of the order $O(2^n)$. In this paper, we aim to\nclarify the upper bound of intrinsic information in quantum systems, as well as\nexplain and resolve the aforementioned paradox. Starting with an analysis of\nthe dependence between the Bloch parameters, we take the structural constraints\nof the quantum state space as a prior and derive the posterior information\ncontent of a quantum state through the process of Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)\nestimation.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) visible light communication (VLC) networks\nutilizing the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme. {In these\nnetworks,} an eavesdropper (Eve) attempts to eavesdrop on communications\nintended for legitimate users (LUs). To enhance information security and energy\nefficiency simultaneously, we formulate a secrecy energy efficiency (SEE)\nmaximization problem. In the formulated problem, beamforming vectors, RSMA\ncommon rates, direct current (DC) bias, and IRS alignment matrices are jointly\noptimized subject to constraints on total power budget, quality of service\n(QoS) requirements, linear operating region of light emitting diodes (LEDs),\nand common information rate allocation. Due to the non-convex and NP-hard\nnature of the formulated problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL)-based dual-sampling proximal policy optimization (DS-PPO) approach. {The\napproach leverages} dual sample strategies and generalized advantage estimation\n(GAE). In addition, to further simplify the design, we adopt the maximum ratio\ntransmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) as beamforming vectors in the action\nspace. Simulation results show that the proposed DS-PPO approach outperforms\ntraditional baseline approaches in terms of achievable SEE and significantly\nimproves convergence speed compared to the original PPO approach. Moreover,\nimplementing the RSMA scheme and IRS contributes to overall system performance,\n{achieving approximately $19.67\\%$ improvement over traditional multiple access\nschemes and $25.74\\%$ improvement over networks without IRS deployment.",

To address the scarcity of\nannotations, we propose a semi supervised segmentation framework designed to\nadvance ROP studies without the need for extensive manual vessel annotation.\nUnlike previous methods that rely solely on limited labeled data, our approach\nleverages teacher student learning by integrating two powerful components: an\nuncertainty weighted vessel unveiling module and domain adversarial learning.\nThe vessel unveiling module helps the model effectively reveal obscured and\nhard to detect vessel structures, while adversarial training aligns feature\nrepresentations across different domains, ensuring robust and generalizable\nvessel segmentations. We validate our approach on public datasets (CHASEDB,\nSTARE) and an in-house ROP dataset, demonstrating its superior performance\nacross multiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, we extend the model's utility\nto a downstream task of ROP multi-stage classification, where vessel masks\nextracted by our segmentation model improve diagnostic accuracy.

We also find an arc of 12CO gas spatially coincident with the\nnorthwestern radio shell of Kes 69. As for the HCO+ line emission, SNRs 3C 391\nand W51C exhibit significant line profile broadening indicative of shock\nperturbation, and CTB109 exhibits a possible blue-shifted line wing brought by\nshock interaction. We do not find significant variation of the I(HCO+)/I(HCN)\nline ratio between broad-line and narrow-line regions, among different SNRs,\nand between MCs associated with SNRs and typical Galactic MCs.

However, the specific detail of the\ntransport terms, such as diffusion and advection terms, that ought to be\nincorporated into PDE models to accurately reflect the memory effect remains\nunclear. To bridge this gap, we propose a straightforward lattice-based model\nwhere the movement of individuals depends on both crowding effects and the\nhistoric distribution within the simulation. The advantage of working with the\nindividual-based model is that it is straightforward to propose and implement\nmemory effects within the simulation in a way that is more biologically\nintuitive than simply proposing heuristic extensions of classical PDE models.\nThrough deriving the continuum limit description of our stochastic model, we\nobtain a novel nonlinear diffusion equation which encompasses memory-based\ndiffusion terms. For the first time we reveal the relationship between\nmemory-based diffusion and the individual-based movement mechanisms that depend\nupon memory effects.

    "abstract": "Recent lattice quantum chromodynamics (lQCD) computations of bottomonium\ncorrelation functions with extended sources provide new insights into\nheavy-quark dynamics at distance scales which are of the order of the inverse\ntemperature. We analyze these results employing the thermodynamic T-matrix\napproach, in a continued effort to interpret lQCD data for quarkonium\ncorrelation functions in a non-perturbative framework suitable for strongly\ncoupled systems. Its key inputs are the in-medium driving kernel (potential) of\nthe scattering equation and an interference function which implements 3-body\neffects in the quarkonium coupling to the thermal medium. A simultaneous\ndescription of lQCD results for the bottomonium correlators with extended\noperators and the previously analyzed Wilson line correlators only requires\nminor refinements of the potential but calls for stronger interference effects\nat larger separation of the bottom quark and antiquark. We then analyze the\npoles of the self-consistent T-matrices on the real axis to assess the survival\nof the various bound states. We estimate the pertinent temperatures where the\npoles disappear for the various bottomonium states and discuss the relation to\nthe corresponding peaks in the bottomonium spectral functions.

To exploit the benefit of STAR-RIS in the\nMIMO-NOMA systems, in this paper, we investigate the analysis and optimization\nof the downlink dual-user MIMO-NOMA systems assisted by multiple STAR-RISs\nunder the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) precoding scheme, in\nwhich the channel is assumed to be Rician faded with the Weichselberger's\ncorrelation structure. To analyze the asymptotic information rate of the users,\nwe apply the operator-valued free probability theory to obtain the Cauchy\ntransform of the generalized singular values (GSVs) of the MIMO-NOMA channel\nmatrices, which can be used to obtain the information rate by Riemann integral.\nThen, considering the special case when the channels between the BS and the\nSTAR-RISs are deterministic, we obtain the closed-form expression for the\nasymptotic information rates of the users. Furthermore, a projected gradient\nascent method (PGAM) is proposed with the derived closed-form expression to\ndesign the STAR-RISs thereby maximizing the sum rate based on the statistical\nchannel state information.

In this study, we performed laboratory\nexperiments and computational analyses on the surface reactions of solid SO2\nwith hydrogen atoms on amorphous solid water (ASW) at low temperatures. After\n40 min of exposure of SO2 deposited on ASW to H atoms, approximately 80% of the\nsolid SO2 was lost from the substrate at 10-40 K, and approximately 50% even at\n60 K, without any definite detection of reaction products. Quantum chemical\ncalculations suggest that H atoms preferentially add to the S atom of solid\nSO2, forming the HSO2 radical. Further reactions of the HSO2 radical with H\natoms result in the formation of several S-bearing species, including HS(O)OH,\nthe S(O)OH radical, HO-S-OH, HS-OH, and H2S. In codeposition experiments\ninvolving H and SO2, we confirmed the formation of H2S, HS(O)OH, and/or\nHO-S-OH.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel algorithm for combined unit and layer pruning of deep\nneural networks that functions during training and without requiring a\npre-trained network to apply. Our algorithm optimally trades-off learning\naccuracy and pruning levels while balancing layer vs. unit pruning and\ncomputational vs. parameter complexity using only three user-defined\nparameters, which are easy to interpret and tune. We formulate a stochastic\noptimization problem over the network weights and the parameters of variational\nBernoulli distributions for binary Random Variables taking values either 0 or 1\nand scaling the units and layers of the network. Optimal network structures are\nfound as the solution to this optimization problem. Pruning occurs when a\nvariational parameter converges to 0 rendering the corresponding structure\npermanently inactive, thus saving computations both during training and\nprediction. A key contribution of our approach is to define a cost function\nthat combines the objectives of prediction accuracy and network pruning in a\ncomputational/parameter complexity-aware manner and the automatic selection of\nthe many regularization parameters. We show that the proposed algorithm\nconverges to solutions of the optimization problem corresponding to\ndeterministic networks. We analyze the ODE system that underlies our stochastic\noptimization algorithm and establish domains of attraction for the dynamics of\nthe network parameters. These theoretical results lead to practical pruning\nconditions avoiding the premature pruning of units and layers during training.\nWe evaluate our method on the CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets using ResNet\narchitectures and demonstrate that it gives improved results with respect to\npruning ratios and test accuracy over layer-only or unit-only pruning and\nfavorably competes with combined unit and layer pruning algorithms requiring\npre-trained networks.",

Existing methods often\nrely on static coreset selection algorithms to pre-identify important data for\ntraining. However, this static nature renders them unable to dynamically track\nthe data usefulness throughout pre-training, leading to subpar pre-trained\nmodels. To address this challenge, our paper introduces a novel dynamic\nbootstrapping dataset pruning method. It involves pruning data preparation\nfollowed by dataset mutation operations, both of which undergo iterative and\ndynamic updates. We apply this method to two prevalent contrastive pre-training\nframeworks: \\textbf{CLIP} and \\textbf{MoCo}, representing vision-language and\nvision-centric domains, respectively. In particular, we individually pre-train\nseven CLIP models on two large-scale image-text pair datasets, and two MoCo\nmodels on the ImageNet dataset, resulting in a total of 16 pre-trained models.\nWith a data pruning rate of 30-35\\% across all 16 models, our method exhibits\nonly marginal performance degradation (less than \\textbf{1\\%} on average)\ncompared to corresponding models trained on the full dataset counterparts\nacross various downstream datasets, and also surpasses several baselines with a\nlarge performance margin. Additionally, the byproduct from our method, \\ie\ncoresets derived from the original datasets after pre-training, also\ndemonstrates significant superiority in terms of downstream performance over\nother static coreset selection approaches.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of sampling a multimodal distribution with a Markov\nchain given a small number of samples from the stationary measure. Although\nmixing can be arbitrarily slow, we show that if the Markov chain has a $k$th\norder spectral gap, initialization from a set of $\\tilde O(k/\\varepsilon^2)$\nsamples from the stationary distribution will, with high probability over the\nsamples, efficiently generate a sample whose conditional law is\n$\\varepsilon$-close in TV distance to the stationary measure. In particular,\nthis applies to mixtures of $k$ distributions satisfying a Poincar\\'e\ninequality, with faster convergence when they satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality.\nOur bounds are stable to perturbations to the Markov chain, and in particular\nwork for Langevin diffusion over $\\mathbb R^d$ with score estimation error, as\nwell as Glauber dynamics combined with approximation error from\npseudolikelihood estimation. This justifies the success of data-based\ninitialization for score matching methods despite slow mixing for the data\ndistribution, and improves and generalizes the results of Koehler and Vuong\n(2023) to have linear, rather than exponential, dependence on $k$ and apply to\narbitrary semigroups. As a consequence of our results, we show for the first\ntime that a natural class of low-complexity Ising measures can be efficiently\nlearned from samples.",

We develop a simple analytic theory describing\nthe evolution of orbital angles and compare it with direct numerical\nsimulations. We find that the tidal torque prevails near 'critical curves' in\nparameter space where the time-averaged apsidal precession rate is close to\nzero. In the limit of small spin, these curves exist only for systems that have\nat least one component with retrograde rotation.

Given some\napproximated control and estimation policies for fully autonomous spacecraft\noperations, we first construct an ellipsoid around its terminal position, where\nthe ISO would be located with a finite probability. The large state uncertainty\nof the ISO is formally handled here through the hierarchical property in\nstochastically contracting nonlinear systems. We then propose a method to find\nthe terminal positions of the multiple spacecraft optimally distributed around\nthe ellipsoid, which locally maximizes the information we can get from all the\npoints of interest (POIs). This utilizes a probabilistic information cost\nfunction that accounts for spacecraft positions, camera specifications, and ISO\nposition uncertainty, where the information is defined as visual data collected\nby cameras. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of this approach\nusing synthetic ISO candidates generated from quasi-realistic empirical\npopulations.

We select 23 GRBs\nco-detected by Fermi/GBM and polarization detectors (i.e., GAP, POLAR and\nAstroSat). In our multi-window fitting, the light curve, $E_p$ curve, PD curve\nand PA curve are interpreted simultaneously under the synchrotron radiation\nmodel in ordered magnetic fields (i.e., the aligned-fields case and the\ntoroidal-fields case). For the bursts with abrupt PA rotations, the predicted\ntime-integrated PD of the aligned-fields case roughly matches the corresponding\nobserved best fit value, while it is higher for the toroidal-fields case. For\nthe bursts without abrupt PA rotation(s), the predicted PDs of the\naligned-fields case and the toroidal-fields case are comparable and could\ninterpret the observational data equally well. For GRB 170206A, its observed\ntime-resolved and time-integrated PDs are comparable and both smaller than our\npredicted upper limits in ordered magnetic fields. So mixed magnetic fields,\ni.e., the magnetic fields with both ordered and random components, should be\nreside in the radiation regions of this burst.

    "abstract": "The demands for accurate and representative generative AI systems means there\nis an increased demand on participatory evaluation structures. While these\nparticipatory structures are paramount to to ensure non-dominant values,\nknowledge and material culture are also reflected in AI models and the media\nthey generate, we argue that dominant structures of community participation in\nAI development and evaluation are not explicit enough about the benefits and\nharms that members of socially marginalized groups may experience as a result\nof their participation. Without explicit interrogation of these benefits by AI\ndevelopers, as a community we may remain blind to the immensity of systemic\nchange that is needed as well. To support this provocation, we present a\nspeculative case study, developed from our own collective experiences as AI\nresearchers. We use this speculative context to itemize the barriers that need\nto be overcome in order for the proposed benefits to marginalized communities\nto be realized, and harms mitigated.",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViT) have recently brought a new wave of research in the\nfield of computer vision. These models have performed particularly well in\nimage classification and segmentation. Research on semantic and instance\nsegmentation has accelerated with the introduction of the new architecture,\nwith over 80% of the top 20 benchmarks for the iSAID dataset based on either\nthe ViT architecture or the attention mechanism behind its success. This paper\nfocuses on the heuristic comparison of three key factors of using (or not\nusing) ViT for semantic segmentation of remote sensing aerial images on the\niSAID dataset. The experimental results observed during this research were\nanalyzed based on three objectives. First, we studied the use of a weighted\nfused loss function to maximize the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score\nand Dice score while minimizing entropy or class representation loss. Second,\nwe compared transfer learning on Meta's MaskFormer, a ViT-based semantic\nsegmentation model, against a generic UNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nbased on mIoU, Dice scores, training efficiency, and inference time. Third, we\nexamined the trade-offs between the two models in comparison to current\nstate-of-the-art segmentation models. We show that the novel combined weighted\nloss function significantly boosts the CNN model's performance compared to\ntransfer learning with ViT.

    "abstract": "A number of models have been developed for information spread through\nnetworks, often for solving the Influence Maximization (IM) problem. IM is the\ntask of choosing a fixed number of nodes to \"seed\" with information in order to\nmaximize the spread of this information through the network, with applications\nin areas such as marketing and public health. Most methods for this problem\nrely heavily on the assumption of known strength of connections between network\nmembers (edge weights), which is often unrealistic. In this paper, we develop a\nlikelihood-based approach to estimate edge weights from the fully and partially\nobserved information diffusion paths. We also introduce a broad class of\ninformation diffusion models, the general linear threshold (GLT) model, which\ngeneralizes the well-known linear threshold (LT) model by allowing arbitrary\ndistributions of node activation thresholds. We then show our weight estimator\nis consistent under the GLT and some mild assumptions. For the special case of\nthe standard LT model, we also present a much faster expectation-maximization\napproach for weight estimation. Finally, we prove that for the GLT models, the\nIM problem can be solved by a natural greedy algorithm with standard optimality\nguarantees if all node threshold distributions have concave cumulative\ndistribution functions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world\nnetworks demonstrate that the flexibility in the choice of threshold\ndistribution combined with the estimation of edge weights significantly\nimproves the quality of IM solutions, spread prediction, and the estimates of\nthe node activation probabilities.",

One way to investigate this is to compare\nparsec-scale jets formed by SMBHs with the projected shape of their\nkiloparsec-scale host galaxies. We analyse Very Long Baseline Interferometry\n(VLBI) images of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and optical images of their host\ngalaxies. We compare the inner-jet position angle in VLBI-detected radio\nsources with the optical shapes of galaxies as measured by several large\noptical surveys. In total 6273 galaxy-AGN pairs were found. We carefully\naccount for the systematics of the cross-matched sources and find that Dark\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys data (DESI LS) is\nsignificantly less affected by them. Using DESI LS, with which 5853 galaxy-AGN\npairs were cross-matched, we find a weak but significant alignment signal (with\na p-value $\\leqslant$ 0.01) between the parsec-scale AGN jet and the kpc\nprojected minor axis of the optical host galaxy in sources with measured\nspectroscopic redshifts. Our results show that the observed source properties\nare connected over 3 orders of magnitude in scale. This points towards an\nintimate connection between the SMBH, their host galaxies and their subsequent\nevolution.",

    "abstract": "Stability selection is a widely adopted resampling-based framework for\nhigh-dimensional variable selection. This paper seeks to broaden the use of an\nestablished stability estimator to evaluate the overall stability of the\nstability selection results, moving beyond single-variable analysis. We suggest\nthat the stability estimator offers two advantages: it can serve as a reference\nto reflect the robustness of the results obtained, and it can help identify a\nPareto optimal regularization value to improve stability. By determining the\nregularization value, we calibrate key stability selection parameters, namely,\nthe decision-making threshold and the expected number of falsely selected\nvariables, within established theoretical bounds. In addition, the convergence\nof stability values over successive sub-samples sheds light on the required\nnumber of sub-samples addressing a notable gap in prior studies.

The aim of this\nproject is to identify lensing events with complex anomaly features that are\ndifficult to explain using standard binary-lens or binary-source models. Our\ninvestigation reveals that the light curves of microlensing events\nKMT-2021-BLG-0284, KMT-2022-BLG-2480, and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 display highly\ncomplex patterns with three or more anomaly features. These features cannot be\nadequately explained by a binary-lens (2L1S) model alone. However, the 2L1S\nmodel can effectively describe certain segments of the light curve. By\nincorporating an additional source into the modeling, we identified a\ncomprehensive model that accounts for all the observed anomaly features.\nBayesian analysis, based on constraints provided by lensing observables,\nindicates that the lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are binary\nsystems composed of M dwarfs. For KMT-2022-BLG-2480, the primary lens is an\nearly K-type main-sequence star with an M dwarf companion. The lenses of\nKMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are likely located in the bulge,\nwhereas the lens of KMT-2022-BLG-2480 is more likely situated in the disk. In\nall events, the binary stars of the sources have similar magnitudes due to a\ndetection bias favoring binary source events with a relatively bright secondary\nsource star, which increases detection efficiency.",
