To address\nthis, our approach maximizes correlation between nearby geometries by\nsynchronizing random number streams, aligning orbitals, using deterministic\nintegral decompositions, and employing a consistent set of classical shadow\nmeasurements defined at a single reference geometry. Crucially, reusing this\nsingle, reference-defined shadow ensemble eliminates the need for additional\nquantum measurements at displaced geometries. Together, these methodological\nchoices substantially reduce statistical variance in computed forces. We\nvalidate the method across hydrogen chains, confirming accuracy throughout\nvarying correlation regimes, and demonstrate significant improvements over\nsingle-reference methods in force evaluations for N$_2$ and stretched linear\nH$_4$, particularly in strongly correlated regions where conventional coupled\ncluster approaches qualitatively fail. Orbital-optimized trial wave functions\nfurther boost accuracy for demanding cases such as stretched CO$_2$, without\nincreasing quantum resource requirements.

To measure the protection of minorities, we\nintroduce the $\\ell$-mutual minority criterion, which requires that if a\nsufficiently large (parametrized by $\\ell$) coalition $T$ of voters ranks all\ncandidates in $S$ lower than all other candidates, then none of the candidates\nin $S$ should win. The highest $\\ell$ for which the criterion is satisfied\nprovides a well-defined measure of mutual minority protection (ranging from 1\nto $m$).\n  Our main contribution is the analysis of a recently proposed class of voting\nrules called $k$-Approval Veto, offering a comprehensive range of trade-offs\nbetween the two principles. This class spans between Plurality Veto (for $k=1$)\n- a simple voting rule achieving optimal metric distortion - and Vote By Veto\n(for $k=m$) which picks a candidate from the proportional veto core. We show\nthat $k$-Approval Veto has minority protection at least $k$, and thus, it\naccommodates any desired level of minority protection. However, this comes at\nthe price of lower social welfare. For the utilitarian objective, the metric\ndistortion increases linearly in $k$. For the $\\alpha$-percentile objective,\nthe metric distortion is the optimal value of 5 for $\\alpha \\ge k/(k+1)$ and\nunbounded for $\\alpha < k/(k+1)$. For the egalitarian objective, the metric\ndistortion is the optimal value of 3 for all values of $k$.",

Notably, a model trained on one or a few snapshots enables efficient\non-the-fly computation of crystallinity. Lastly, we demonstrate how the optimal\nC-index fit evolves during various stages of crystallization, supporting the\nhypothesis that entropy dominates early nucleation, while symmetry gains\nrelevance later. This workflow provides a data-driven strategy for OP selection\nand a metric to monitor structural transformations in large-scale polymer\nsimulations.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a\nsignificant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially\nthose focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise\nfrom complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose\nSIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular\nLearning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)\nemploys twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with\nassistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted\ndecision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.\nUnlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for\nLLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe\nsummary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel\ndataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of\n0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and\nstatistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.\nFurthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,\nSIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with\ninjected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from\n0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,\nprivacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.",

    "abstract": "In a Conversational Image Recommendation task, users can provide natural\nlanguage feedback on a recommended image item, which leads to an improved\nrecommendation in the next turn. While typical instantiations of this task\nassume that the user's target item will (eventually) be returned, this might\noften not be true, for example, the item the user seeks is not within the item\ncatalogue. Failing to return a user's desired item can lead to user\nfrustration, as the user needs to interact with the system for an increased\nnumber of turns. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we introduce the task\nof Supervised Conversational Performance Prediction, inspired by Query\nPerformance Prediction (QPP) for predicting effectiveness in response to a\nsearch engine query. In this regard, we propose predictors for conversational\nperformance that detect conversation failures using multi-turn semantic\ninformation contained in the embedded representations of retrieved image items.\nSpecifically, our AutoEncoder-based predictor learns a compressed\nrepresentation of top-retrieved items of the train turns and uses the\nclassification labels to predict the evaluation turn. Our evaluation scenario\naddressed two recommendation scenarios, by differentiating between system\nfailure, where the system is unable to find the target, and catalogue failure,\nwhere the target does not exist in the item catalogue. In our experiments using\nthe Shoes and FashionIQ Dresses datasets, we measure the accuracy of predictors\nfor both system and catalogue failures. Our results demonstrate the promise of\nour proposed predictors for predicting system failures (existing evaluation\nscenario), while we detect a considerable decrease in predictive performance in\nthe case of catalogue failure prediction (when inducing a missing item\nscenario) compared to system failures.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of variable selection in Bayesian multivariate linear\nregression models, involving multiple response and predictor variables, under\nmultivariate normal errors. In the absence of a known covariance structure,\nspecifying a model with a non-diagonal covariance matrix is appealing. Modeling\ndependency in the random errors through a non-diagonal covariance matrix is\ngenerally expected to lead to improved estimation of the regression\ncoefficients. In this article, we highlight an interesting exception: modeling\nthe dependency in errors can significantly worsen both estimation and\nprediction. We demonstrate that Bayesian multi-outcome regression models using\nseveral popular variable selection priors can suffer from poor estimation\nproperties in low-information settings--such as scenarios with weak signals,\nhigh correlation among predictors and responses, and small sample sizes. In\nsuch cases, the simultaneous estimation of all unknown parameters in the model\nbecomes difficult when using a non-diagonal covariance matrix. Through\nsimulation studies and a dataset with measurements from NIR spectroscopy, we\nillustrate that a two-step procedure--estimating the mean and the covariance\nmatrix separately--can provide more accurate estimates in such cases. Thus, a\npotential solution to avoid the problem altogether is to routinely perform an\nadditional analysis with a diagonal covariance matrix, even if the errors are\nexpected to be correlated.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose time and frequency synchronization techniques for\nuplink multiuser OTFS (MU-OTFS) systems in high-mobility scenarios. This work\nfocuses on accurately estimating and correcting timing offsets (TOs) and\ncarrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Specifically, TO estimation is essential for\nlocating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances\nchannel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an\nexisting multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot\n(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix\n(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs\ndifferent Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via\ncorrelation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a\ncorrelation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot\nstructure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is\nproposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the\ndelay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO\nestimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'\nsignals and accurately estimate their TOs. Then, we derive a mathematical\nthreshold range to enhance TO estimation accuracy by finding the first major\npeak in the correlation function rather than relying solely on the highest\npeak. After locating the received users' pilot signals using one of the\nproposed TO estimation techniques, our proposed CFO estimation technique\nreduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into\nmultiple one-dimensional search problems. In this technique, we apply the\nChebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to\neffectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO\nestimates for all the users.",

It was collected from eleven older adults participating\nin weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac\nrehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset\nof its kind.

Annotations include binary engagement\nstates, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as\nwhether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers\nversions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples.

    "abstract": "To reduce channel acquisition overhead, spatial, time, and frequency-domain\nchannel extrapolation techniques have been widely studied. In this paper, we\npropose a novel deep learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation\nframework (named PCEnet) for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) systems. The user's position, which contains significant channel\ncharacteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel\nacquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments\nbetween different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective\nchannels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique\nacross all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages\nthe position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the\ncharacteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to\nassist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach\nfirst utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the\nobtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central\nprocessing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and\nconcatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to\nreconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition\nperformance. Additionally, we propose a simplified strategy where only the\nestimated position is used in the reconstruction process without modifying the\npilot design, thereby reducing latency. Furthermore, we introduce a position\nlabel-free approach that infers the relative user position instead of the\nabsolute position, eliminating the need for ground truth position labels during\nthe localization NN training. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nPCEnet framework reduces pilot and feedback overheads by up to 50%.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written\nmaterials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving\nthe creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.\nAdversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit\ndetectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have\nmainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying\naccuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature\nabout DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we\ninvestigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text\nClassifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can\nconsistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed\nto the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a\ndetector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)\nfor classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored\nquestion-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses\nusing DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied\nadversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more\nsamples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy\nimpact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on\noriginal and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text\nClassifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack\nwas humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and\n52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best\nfive-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human\nrecall 100%).",

For example, measuring the response time (of a human\ndriver or ADS) to a conflict requires the determination of a stimulus onset and\na response onset. In existing studies, response onset relies on manual\nannotation or vehicle control signals such as accelerator and brake pedal\nmovements. These methods are not applicable when analyzing large scale data\nwhere vehicle control signals are not available. This holds in particular for\nthe rapidly expanding sets of ADS log data where the behavior of surrounding\nroad users is observed via onboard sensors. To advance evaluation techniques\nfor ADS and enable measuring response timing when vehicle control signals are\nnot available, we developed a simple and efficient algorithm, based on a\npiecewise linear acceleration model, to automatically estimate brake onset that\ncan be applied to any type of driving data that includes vehicle longitudinal\ntime series data. We also proposed a manual annotation method to identify brake\nonset and used it as ground truth for validation. R^2 was used as a confidence\nmetric to measure the accuracy of the algorithm, and its classification\nperformance was analyzed using naturalistic collision avoidance data of both\nADS and humans, where our method was validated against human manual annotation.\nAlthough our algorithm is subject to certain limitations, it is efficient,\ngeneralizable, applicable to any road user and scenario types, and is highly\nconfigurable.",

In this work, we introduce Adversarial\nPhoneTic Prompting (APT), an attack that replaces iconic phrases with\nhomophonic alternatives--e.g., \"mom's spaghetti\" becomes \"Bob's\nconfetti\"--preserving the acoustic form while largely changing semantic\ncontent. We demonstrate that models can be prompted to regurgitate memorized\nsongs using phonetically similar but semantically unrelated lyrics. Despite the\nsemantic drift, black-box models like SUNO and open-source models like YuE\ngenerate outputs that are strikingly similar to the original\nsongs--melodically, rhythmically, and vocally--achieving high scores on\nAudioJudge, CLAP, and CoverID. These effects persist across genres and\nlanguages. More surprisingly, we find that phonetic prompts alone can trigger\nvisual memorization in text-to-video models: when given altered lyrics from\nLose Yourself, Veo 3 generates scenes that mirror the original music\nvideo--complete with a hooded rapper and dim urban settings--despite no\nexplicit visual cues in the prompt. This cross-modality leakage represents an\nunprecedented threat: models memorize deep, structural patterns that transcend\ntheir training modality, making traditional safety measures like copyright\nfilters ineffective. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in\ntranscript-conditioned generative models and raise urgent concerns around\ncopyright, provenance, and secure deployment of multimodal generation systems.",

In the long term, a constant cycle of about 4 years\nis most strongly present in the entire data. Besides, we also found a\nmodulation of about 11 years, and a slowly decreasing cycle of about 5.7-5.2\nyears. From the seasonal datasets we found that the most dominant\nrotation-related periods are scattered around the orbital period. From this we\ninfer a solar-type surface differential rotation, although the surface shear is\nsignificantly smaller than that of the Sun.\n  The 4-year cycle indicates flip-flop-like behavior: during this time, the 2-3\nactive longitudes usually present on the stellar surface are rearranged. The\nmagnitude-range changes in the long term cannot be interpreted solely as\nchanges in the number and size of spots; the unspotted brightness of XX Tri has\nalso increased over the decades.

Arrhenotoky is a form of asexual reproduction in which\nunfertilized eggs become males while fertilized eggs develop into females,\nleading to unusual patterns of genetic relatedness between family members. This\nmode of reproduction occurs in insects such as the Hymenoptera, including bees.\nIn the hive environment, bees often display altruistic behavior, or actions\ntaken by an organism that reduce its own fitness to increase the fitness of\nothers. Eusociality, an elaborate form of social organization characterized by\ncomplex and altruistic social behaviors, is also observed in the Hymenoptera.\nTo explore the interplay between altruism and the reproductive patterns of\narrhenotoky, we employ a population dynamics model to simulate beehive\npopulations over a range of parameters, controlling for altruism in workers and\nthe queen. Our results show that altruistic behaviors are essential for beehive\nsuccess, with optimal worker altruism corresponding to the division of labor\nobserved in eusocial species. Furthermore, we find that modest altruism from\nthe queen is also vital for hive survival, emphasizing the delicate balance\nthat can exist in these complex social systems. Overall, our findings shed\nlight on the co-evolution of altruism, arrhenotoky, and eusociality in the\nnatural world.",

Current techniques for\ngenerating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically\ngenerated.

    "abstract": "Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlated\nsets of features between two datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel\nextension of CCA to the online, streaming data setting: Sliding Window\nInformative Canonical Correlation Analysis (SWICCA). Our method uses a\nstreaming principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm as a backend and uses\nthese outputs combined with a small sliding window of samples to estimate the\nCCA components in real time. We motivate and describe our algorithm, provide\nnumerical simulations to characterize its performance, and provide a\ntheoretical performance guarantee. The SWICCA method is applicable and scalable\nto extremely high dimensions, and we provide a real-data example that\ndemonstrates this capability.",

In this\npaper we investigate the correlation between the positions of IceCat-1 neutrino\nevents and a large, optically selected QSO catalog extracted from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey. Within this sample, we distinguish radio-quiet QSOs from\nflat-spectrum radio QSOs (FSRQs)based on radio emission data from the Cosmic\nLens All Sky Survey (CLASS) catalog. While the associations between neutrino\nevents and radio-quiet QSOs are consistent with being all random matches, FSRQs\nexhibit a moderately significant correlation (2.7 sigma) with neutrino\npositions. Additionally we observe that the distribution of minimum distances\nbetween neutrino events and FSRQs differs significantly for events at\ndeclinations above and below 20 deg. In particular, using the KS test, we find\nthat the high-declination event distribution shows a strong deviation (4 sigma)\nfrom a random distribution. We interpret all these results as an indication\nthat a large fraction (> 60%) of the neutrino events observed by IceCube could\nbe produced by the FSRQ and that the emission mechanism is likely related to\nthe relativistic jets rather than the \"radio-quiet\" (RQ) component of these\nsources, such as the accretion disk or corona.",

In this paper, we achieve massive scalability in SNOW by\nenabling the BS to decode concurrent data from numerous asynchronous sensors on\nthe same subcarrier while parallelly decoding from other subcarriers as well.\nAdditionally, we enable numerous asynchronous sensors to receive distinct data\nfrom the BS on the same subcarrier while other sensors also receive data\nparallelly on other subcarriers. To do this, we develop a set of Gold\ncode-based pseudorandom noise or PN sequences that are mutually non-interfering\nwithin and across the subcarriers. Each sensor uses its PN sequence from the\nset for encoding or decoding data on its subcarriers, enabling massive\nconcurrency. Our evaluation results demonstrate that we can achieve\napproximately 9x more scalability in SNOW while being timely in data collection\nat the BS and energy efficient at the sensors. This may enable emerging IoT and\nCPS applications requiring tens of thousands of sensors with longer battery\nlife and making data-driven, time-sensitive decisions.",

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of large-scale AI models has led to computational and\npower demands that can exceed the capacity of a single data center. This is due\nto the limited power supplied by regional grids that leads to limited regional\ncomputational power. Consequently, distributing training workloads across\ngeographically distributed sites has become essential. However, this approach\nintroduces a significant challenge in the form of communication overhead,\ncreating a fundamental trade-off between the performance gains from accessing\ngreater aggregate power and the performance losses from increased network\nlatency. Although prior work has focused on reducing communication volume or\nusing heuristics for distribution, these methods assume constant homogeneous\npower supplies and ignore the challenge of heterogeneous power availability\nbetween sites.\n  To address the challenge of training large models in power-constrained,\ngeo-distributed environments, we introduce PowerTrip, a system that dynamically\nselects a subset of sites during runtime to optimize the power-communication\ntrade-off. Specifically, PowerTrip selects sites based on a power-to-cost\nheuristic, prioritizing those with high power availability and low network\nlatency. PowerTrip employs a dynamic greedy approach and uses the marginal gain\nin training efficiency, i.e., accuracy improvement per unit of time, to\noptimize for the number of sites where the performance penalty from network\noverhead negates the benefit of adding more computational power. Our\nevaluation, which uses real-world Google power traces to model realistic power\ncapacity constraints, demonstrates that PowerTrip can reduce time-to-accuracy\nby up to 50% compared to existing baseline policies.",

This work investigates the behavior of\nQuantum Fisher Information (QFI) as a diagnostic tool for entanglement and\nparameter estimation in a three-qubit entangled Dirac system subjected to\ndissipative noisy channels in the curved spacetime of a Schwarzschild black\nhole. In particular, we examine the influence of the squeezed generalized\namplitude damping (SGAD) channel, along with its subchannels -- generalized\namplitude damping (GAD) and amplitude damping (AD) -- on the QFI with respect\nto entanglement weight ($\\theta$) and phase ($\\phi$) parameters. Our results\nshow that under strong squeezing ($r = 1$), the QFI with respect to $\\theta$\nbecomes completely resistant to variations in the Hawking temperature ($T_H$),\nwhile still exhibiting degradation with increasing channel temperature ($T_C$).\nThe QFI decay is significantly slower at $r = 1$ compared to $r = 0$,\nsuggesting that squeezing can function as an error mitigation strategy. For QFI\nwith respect to $\\phi$, a transient spike is observed at $T_C = 2$, potentially\ndue to thermal resonance or non-monotonic decoherence, and this behavior is\nunaffected by $T_H$. Similar patterns are noted in the GAD and AD channels,\nwhere $T_C$ consistently dominates as the principal source of decoherence.\nOverall, the results highlight the intricate interplay between environmental\nnoise, relativistic effects, and quantum error resilience in curved spacetime.",

    "abstract": "Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range\ndependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.\nHowever, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to\nhigh-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research\nfocus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which\ncomputes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While\neffective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for\nhigh-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated\nNeighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its\nsuccess in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local\nprecision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,\neffectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,\nour preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local\ndesign to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,\nprimarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local\nattention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that\ncomplements local attention, effectively integrating global context without\nsacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based\narchitecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive\nresults across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for\ndiverse low-level computer vision problems.",

However, prior studies have predominantly employed\nFe--Co alloy catalysts with fixed atomic ratios as well as unchanged chemical\nvapor deposition (CVD) conditions, leaving the influence of variable Fe--Co\ncompositions and CVD growth parameters on SWCNT synthesis poorly understood.\nThis study focuses on the role of Fe--Co catalyst ratios, with the aim of\nelucidating the distinct contributions of Fe and Co atoms in the growth of\nSWCNTs. By systematically exploring a wide range of Fe--Co ratios and growth\nconditions, we identified Fe$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.25}$ as a highly efficient binary\ncatalyst at 850~$^\\circ$C, primarily forming catalyst clusters with diameters\nof 2.5--6~nm and yielding SWCNTs with diameters ranging from 0.9--1.1~nm.

Several approaches\nhave been proposed in the literature for detecting vulnerable codes and\nidentifying the classes of vulnerabilities. However, there is still room to\nwork in explaining the root causes of detected vulnerabilities through locating\nvulnerable statements and the discovery of paths leading to the activation of\nthe vulnerability. While frameworks like SliceLocator offer explanations by\nidentifying vulnerable paths, they rely on rule-based sink identification that\nlimits their generalization. In this paper, we introduce VulPathFinder, an\nexplainable vulnerability path discovery framework that enhances SliceLocator's\nmethodology by utilizing a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for detecting\nsink statements, rather than relying on predefined rules. The proposed GNN\ncaptures semantic and syntactic dependencies to find potential sink points\n(PSPs), which are candidate statements where vulnerable paths end. After\ndetecting PSPs, program slicing can be used to extract potentially vulnerable\npaths, which are then ranked by feeding them back into the target graph-based\ndetector. Ultimately, the most probable path is returned, explaining the root\ncause of the detected vulnerability. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach by performing evaluations on a benchmark of the buffer\noverflow CWEs from the SARD dataset, providing explanations for the\ncorresponding detected vulnerabilities. The results show that VulPathFinder\noutperforms both original SliceLocator and GNNExplainer (as a general GNN\nexplainability tool) in discovery of vulnerability paths to identified PSPs.",

The search uses a data sample corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the CMS experiment in\nproton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The reinterpretation considers\nthe production of new heavy four-jet resonances, with widths ranging from 1.5\nto 10% of their mass, which decay to a pair of dijet resonances. This analysis\nprobes resonant production in the four-jet and dijet mass distributions.

Peripheral chromatin organization can be further modulated by the\nnuclear lamina, which is itself a deformable structure. While a number of\nbiophysical mechanisms for compartmentalization within rigid nuclei have been\nexplored, we study a chromatin model consisting of an active, crosslinked\npolymer tethered to a deformable, polymeric lamina shell. Contractile motors,\nthe deformability of the shell, and the spatial distribution of crosslinks all\nplay pivotal roles in this compartmentalization. We find that a radial\ncrosslink density distribution, even with a small linear differential of higher\ncrosslinking density at the edge of the nucleus, combined with contractile\nmotor activity, drives genomic segregation, in agreement with experimental\nobservations. This arises from contractile motors preferentially drawing\ncrosslinks into their vicinity at the nuclear periphery, forming high-density\ndomains that promote heterochromatin formation. We also find an increased\nstiffness of nuclear wrinkles given the preferential heterochromatin compaction\nbelow the lamina shell, which is consistent with instantaneous nuclear\nstiffening under applied nanoindentation.

Our results reveal that the interplay of\nboth network topology and decoherence model influences coherence preservation.\nIntrinsic decoherence results in the slowest decay of coherence, followed by\nHaken-Strobl noise, while QSW causes the most rapid loss of coherence. The\nstability ranking among network topologies varies depending on the decoherence\nmodel and quantifier used. For example, under Haken-Strobl and intrinsic\ndecoherence, the quantum-classical distance ranks the cycle network more stable\nthan scale-free networks, although other metrics consistently favour scale-free\ntopologies. In general, heterogeneous networks, such as star and scale-free\nnetworks, exhibit the highest stability, whereas homogeneous topologies, such\nas cycle and Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi networks, are more vulnerable to decoherence.\nThe complete graph, despite its homogeneity, remains highly stable due to its\ndense connectivity.

In this work, we explore an all-optical pathway to\nextend exciton lifetimes by placing MoSe$_2$ in a deep-subwavelength\nFabry-Perot silver cavity. The cavity structure is designed to suppress\nradiative recombination from in-plane optical dipoles, such as bright excitons\nand trions. We observe a consistent decrease in photoluminescence (PL)\nlinewidths of excitons and trions (~1 nm), along with a corresponding lifetime\nincrease (~10 ps). We confirm the experimental observations arise purely from\nexciton-cavity interactions-etching back the top silver layer returns the PL\nlinewidth and lifetimes return to their original values. Our study offers a\npathway to engineer excited state lifetimes in 2D materials which can be\nutilized for studies of optically dark excitons and have potential applications\nfor novel optoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": "We derive a factorization formula for boosted double resonant top-antitop\npair production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation with a semileptonic top quark decay in\nthe phase space region where the $b$-jet invariant mass is small. The decaying\ntop quark state is defined through invariant mass measurements on the final\nstates in the top and antitop hemispheres, and the $b$-jet is defined from\nclustering all hadrons in the top hemisphere. The factorization does not rely\non the narrow width limit and accounts for the QCD off-shell and interference\neffects. The approach employs Soft-Collinear-Effective Theory and boosted\nHeavy-Quark-Effective-Theory and relies on a combination of factorization\ntheorems known from $e^+e^-$ dijet production and inclusive semileptonic heavy\nmeson endpoint decays. The result provides a first principles treatment of the\ndominant hadronization effects, which can be determined from $e^+e^-$ event\nshapes. In the factorization a new distribution function arises, called the\nultra-collinear-soft (ucs) function, which encodes the Fermi motion of the\ndecaying top quark within the state defined from the invariant mass\nmeasurement. The ucs function is a differential generalization of the inclusive\nbHQET jet function and shares properties of the shape function in semileptonic\nheavy meson decays. In frames where the top quark is very slow, it describes\nthe coherent soft radiation arising from top production, propagation and decay,\nand encodes all effects that are non-factorizable from the perspective of the\nNW limit. Its form and renormalization depend on two light-cone momenta related\nto the top-jet and and $b$-jet directions and their relative angle. Due to the\nlarge top quark width, the ucs function can be computed perturbatively, and we\ndetermine the QCD corrections at ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s)$.

The selected spectral\nbands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models,\nGradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The\ncomparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets\nshowed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection\nmethods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level\ndatasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm,\nand 900-950nm.

Using this, we assembled the largest sample to date: 441\nFSRQs and 464 SSRQs with suitable optical spectra to study both strong\nabsorbers and weak (0.3 A < W_r(2796) < 1.0 A) Mg II absorbers. We conducted a\ndetailed comparison of absorbers' incidence rate and offset velocity\ndistributions. Our main findings are: (i) For both weak and strong absorbers,\nwe found no significant excess in dN/dz towards FSRQ compared to SSRQ\nsightlines.

We derive the stochastic\nSchr\\\"odinger equations (SSE) and related quantum master equations (QME) for\nthe average density matrix for different stochastic potentials. We compare the\ncase of memory and memoryless processes, which reflect different short-time\nbehaviors and, in some cases, can lead to different stationary distributions of\nthe average system state. Focusing on the use of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck coloured\nnoise driving the dynamics, in the same fashion as the white noise is the\nformal derivative of a Wiener process, we shed light on how different\ndissipative terms of a generic QME arise depending on the nature of the\nstochastic potential involved, and their effect on the short and long time\nevolution of the system. We rationalize the emergence of the different terms in\nterms of the time- and frequency-dependent coefficients Redfield QME. Within\nthis framework, we explicitly derive a closure model for the open terms in the\nQME derived from the SSE approach, and clarify how colored noise impacts the\ncoherence relaxation time scales",

The results\nhighlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,\nas well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of\ndifferent architectures.

To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B\nparameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion\ndifference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device\ndeployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction\nmechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from\nsports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through\nmask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action\ndescription generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,\nSV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation\nmetrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger\nclosed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly\nlower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability\nin generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,\nachieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,\nwith substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and\nmeasurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.\nModel Available at https://huggingface.co/sportsvision/SV3.3B.",

Approximating (single-source) shortest paths\non undirected graphs is a longstanding open question in this model. In this\nwork, we make progress on this question from both upper and lower bound fronts:\n  We present a simple randomized algorithm that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, with\nhigh probability computes $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate shortest paths from a\ngiven source vertex in \\[\n  O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\cdot n \\log^3 n \\right)~\\text{space} \\quad\n\\text{and} \\quad O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log\nn} \\right) ^2\\right) ~\\text{passes}.\n  \\] The algorithm can also be derandomized and made to work on dynamic streams\nat a cost of some extra $\\text{poly}(\\log n, 1/\\epsilon)$ factors only in the\nspace.

Inelastic electron scattering\n(EELS), performed in either transmission (T-EELS) or reflection (R-EELS)\ngeometries, is a powerful probe of $\\chi(q,\\omega)$. For the prototypical\nstrange metal Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$, T-EELS, R-EELS, and infrared (IR)\nspectroscopy agree at $q \\sim 0$, all revealing a highly damped plasmon near 1\neV. At larger $q$, however, EELS results show unresolved discrepancies. Since\nIR data are highly reproducible, it is advantageous to use IR data to calculate\nwhat the expected EELS response should be at modest $q$. Building on prior\nR-EELS work [J. Chen \\textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. B. \\textbf{109}, 045108\n(2024)], we extend this approach to T-EELS for finite stacks of metallic\nlayers, comparing a \"textbook\" Lindhard metal to a strange metal. In the\nLindhard case, the low-$q$ response is dominated by long-lived, standing wave\nplasmon modes arising from interlayer Coulomb coupling, with in-plane\ndispersions that resemble the well-known Fetter modes of layered metals. This\nbehavior depends only on the geometry and the long-ranged nature of the Coulomb\ninteraction, and is largely insensitive to layer details. At larger $q$, the\nresponse reflects the microscopic properties of individual layers. For the\nstrange metal, calculations based on IR data predict a highly damped plasmon\nwith weak dispersion and no distinct surface mode. While our results match IR\nand R-EELS at low $q$, they do not reproduce any published EELS spectra at\nlarge $q$, highlighting unresolved discrepancies that demand further\nexperimental investigation.",

By promoting unitarity double-cuts to $d=4-2\\epsilon$ dimensions,\nthe constructible integrands incorporate both branch-cut components and\nrational terms. The unconstructible parts, such as tadpoles and kinematically\nindependent bubbles, are proved to be unnecessary for EFT matching. In this\nframework, all requisite loop amplitudes are constructed by sewing a pair of\non-shell tree-level amplitudes. Consequently, the method eliminates\ncomplications from gauge fixing and ghost fields inherent in traditional loop\ncalculations, while also avoiding supplementary efforts to construct rational\nterms and implement generalized unitarity cuts for master integral coefficient\nextraction required in conventional on-shell approaches. This yields a more\nefficient and systematic methodology. Furthermore, UV amplitudes are\nsystematically matched to a complete set of on-shell amplitude bases via large\nmass expansion, bypassing concerns about operator redundancies or gauge\ninvariance issues inherent in traditional matching methods. Therefore, this\nframework can be more easily implemented in programs.",

Detailed\nanalysis of the multi-wavelength afterglow light curves of recent GRBs indeed\nshows evidence for an extended angular structure beyond the jet's narrow core.\nThe afterglow emission is determined by the jet angular structure, our viewing\nangle, and the magnetic field structure behind the shock, often leading to\ndegeneracies when considering the light curves and broad-band spectrum alone.\nSuch degeneracies can be lifted with joint modeling of the afterglow light\ncurves and polarization. In this work we study the evolution of the afterglow\nlinear polarization and flux density from steep, core-dominated GRB jets, where\nmost of their energy resides within a narrow core. We explore the dependence of\nthe light and polarization curves on the viewing angle, jet angular energy\nstructure and magnetic field configuration, and provide an analytical\napproximation for the peak polarization level, which occurs at a time close to\nthat of a break in the light curve.

The CMB is one of the few windows into the ionization\nstate of the IGM during reionization's first half, providing an important probe\nof the ionizing photon sources at those times. Meanwhile, measurements of the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest in the spectra of high-$z$ quasars have improved to the\nlevel of tightly constraining the timing of reionization's end. In this paper,\nwe use radiative transfer simulations to explore how measurements of the patchy\nkinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (pkSZ) effect, when combined with Lyman-$\\alpha$\nforest measurements, can be used to constrain the early stages of reionization\nand the nature of its sources. For a given source model, we find that the\namplitude of the pkSZ power spectra strongly correlates with the start time of\nreionization, and constrains the number of ionizing photons produced by the\nhigh-$z$ source population. Allowing for variations in the source model, this\ncorrelation is weakened by a degeneracy between the reionization history and\nthe effects of source clustering. However, we demonstrate two potential ways of\nbreaking this degeneracy using: (1) measurements of large-scale fluctuations in\nthe Ly$\\alpha$ forest opacity at $z=5-6$, and/or; (2) the shape of the pkSZ\npower spectrum measured in future CMB surveys. Models with highly clustered\nsources yield steeper slopes in the pkSZ power around $\\ell = 3,000$, so\nmeasurements at additional angular scales can be used to break the\nhistory-clustering degeneracy. Our results highlight how future pkSZ\nmeasurements will complement JWST observations to improve our understanding of\nthe ionizing sources near cosmic dawn.",

    "abstract": "Simulating black hole (BH) accretion and feedback from the horizon to\ngalactic scales is extremely challenging, as it involves a vast range of\nscales. Recently, our multizone method has successfully achieved global\ndynamical steady-states of hot accretion flows in three-dimensional general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations by tracking the\nbidirectional interaction between a non-spinning BH and its host galaxy. In\nthis paper, we present technical improvements to the method and apply it to\nspin $a_*=0.9$ BHs, which power relativistic jets. We first test the new\nmultizone set-up with a smaller Bondi radius, $R_B\\approx400\\,r_g$, where $r_g$\nis the gravitational radius. The strongly magnetized accretion launches a\nrelativistic jet with an intermediate feedback efficiency $\\eta\\sim30\\,\\%$, in\nbetween that of a prograde ($\\eta\\sim100\\,\\%$) and retrograde ($\\eta\\sim\n10\\,\\%$) torus. Interestingly, both prograde and retrograde simulations also\neventually converge to the same intermediate efficiency when evolved long\nenough, as accumulated magnetic fields remove gas rotation. We then extend\nstrongly magnetized simulations to larger Bondi radii, $R_B\\approx\n2\\times10^3,~2\\times 10^4,~2\\times 10^5\\,r_g$. We find that the BH accretion\nrate $\\dot{M}$ is suppressed with respect to the Bondi rate $\\dot{M}_B$ as\n$\\dot{M}/\\dot{M}_B\\propto R_B^{-1/2}$. However, despite some variability, the\ntime-averaged feedback efficiency is $\\eta\\sim30\\,\\%$, independent of $R_B$.\nThis suggests that BH feedback efficiency in hot accretion flows is mainly\ngoverned by the BH spin ($a_*$) rather than by the galactic properties ($R_B$).\nFrom these first-principles simulations, we provide a feedback subgrid\nprescription for cosmological simulations: $\\dot{E}_{\\rm\nfb}=2\\times10^{-3}[R_B/(2\\times10^5\\,r_g)]^{-1/2}\\dot{M}_Bc^2$ for BH spin\n$a_*=0.9$.",

The first activity epoch was discovered during the\nperihelion in 2016 (Garcia-Migani & Gil-Hutton 2018), so we were motivated to\nobserve it for recurrent cometary activity near its next perihelion passage (UT\n2024 July 20). We obtained observations with the Lowell Discovery Telescope\n(LDT), the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) telescope, and the Vatican\nAdvanced Technology Telescope (VATT) and identified a second activity epoch\nwhen 362P had a true anomaly (v) as early as 318.1 deg. We conducted archival\nsearches of numerous repositories and identified images obtained with\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) MegaCam, Dark Energy Camera (DECam),\nPan-STARRS 1, SkyMapper, Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and Las Cumbres\nObservatory Global Telescope (LCOGT) network data. Using these data, we\nidentified activity from a previously unreported timespan, and we did not\ndetect activity when 362P was away from perihelion, specifically 83 deg < v <\n318 deg. Detection of activity near perihelion and absence of activity away\nfrom perihelion suggest thermally-driven activity and volatile sublimation. Our\ndynamical simulations suggest 362P is a QHC and it will remain in a combined\nJupiter-family comet (JFC) and quasi-Hilda orbit over the next 1 kyr, though it\nwill become increasingly chaotic nearing the end of this timeframe. Our\nbackward simulations suggest 362P may have migrated from the orbit of a Long\nPeriod Comet (~53%) or Centaur (~32%), otherwise it remained a JFC (~15%) over\nthe previous 100 kyr. We recommend additional telescope observations from the\ncommunity as 362P continues outbound from its perihelion on UT 2024 July 20, as\nwell as continued observations for a third activity epoch.",

    "abstract": "Line intensity mapping (LIM) promises to probe previously inaccessible\ncorners of the faint and high-redshift universe. However, confusion with bright\nforegrounds is a major challenge for current-era pathfinder LIM experiments.\nCross-correlation with cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing is a promising\navenue to enable the first LIM detections at high redshifts, a pristine probe\nof fundamental physics but sparsely populated by faint galaxies, and to further\nprobe the connection between matter and spectral line emission, expanding our\nunderstanding of galaxies and the IGM. Previous works have suggested that this\ndirect correlation between LIM and CMB lensing is effectively impossible\nbecause smoothly varying modes in the intensity map are lost to bright\nforegrounds. In this work, we analytically revisit the direct correlation of\nforeground-filtered line intensity mapping with CMB lensing, highlighting\nlightcone evolution's previously neglected yet unavoidable and crucial effects.\nIndeed, the growth of structure and evolution of line emission along the\nlightcone breaks statistical translational invariance and thus induces mode\ncoupling, even in linear theory, which enables the recovery of the smoothly\nvarying modes lost to bright foregrounds. We compute the effects of these\nlightcone evolution-induced mode couplings on the LIMxCMB lensing\ncross-spectrum detectability, predicting that future wider-sky versions of\nCOMAP, CCAT, and HETDEX will be able to precisely measure this\ncross-correlation. Although we focus on the direct correlation of LIM with CMB\nlensing in this paper, our arguments generalize to the direct correlation of\nLIM with any projected field.",

    "abstract": "We study current fluctuations in the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion\nProcess (TASEP) on a ring with $N$ sites and $p$ particles. By introducing a\ndeformation parameter $\\gamma$, we analyze the tilted operator that governs the\nstatistics of the time-integrated current. Employing the coordinate Bethe\nansatz, we derive implicit expressions for the scaled cumulant generating\nfunction (SCGF), i.e. the largest eigenvalue, and the spectral gap, both in\nterms of Bethe roots. Their asymptotic behaviour is characterized by using the\ngeometric structure of Cassini oval.\n  In the thermodynamic limit at fixed particle density, we identify a dynamical\nphase transition separating fluctuation regimes. For $\\gamma>0$, the SCGF\nexhibits ballistic growth with system size, $\\lambda_1 \\sim N$. In contrast,\nfor $\\gamma<0$, the SCGF converges to $-1$ as $N\\to\\infty$. This transition is\nreflected in the spectral gap, which controls the system's relaxation\ntimescale.

We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that\ntransforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates--where\none model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and\ndefends an alternative answer--adjudicated by a judge model blind to the\ncorrect solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach\nsubstantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet\nreuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions:\n(1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based\nassessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's\neffectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized\nprotocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of\nthe method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model\nfine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%)\nbut performed worse in debates. Results also show that even weaker judges can\nreliably differentiate stronger debaters, highlighting how debate-based\nevaluation can scale to future, more capable systems while maintaining a\nfraction of the cost of creating new benchmarks.

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a novel and\ndirect probe of baryons, tracing the integrated ionised electron density along\nthe line-of-sight, quantified by the dispersion measure (DM). The scatter of\nthe DM as a function of redshift provides insight into the lumpiness of the\nelectron distribution and, consequently, baryonic feedback processes. Using a\nmodel calibrated to the \\texttt{BAHAMAS} hydrodynamical simulation suite, we\nforward-model the statistical properties of the DM with redshift.

    "abstract": "Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, red sources discovered by JWST at high\nredshift ($z \\gtrsim 4$), marked by distinctive \"V-shaped\" spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) and often interpreted as rapidly accreting AGNs. Their\nevolution remains unclear, as identifying counterparts at lower redshifts is\nchallenging. We present WISEA J123635.56+621424.2 (here dubbed {\\it the\nSaguaro}), a $z=2.0145$ galaxy in GOODS-North, as a possible analog of\nhigh-redshift LRDs and a potential missing link in their evolutionary path\ntoward lower-redshift systems. It features a compact LRD-like nucleus\nsurrounded by a face-on spiral host. Its connection to LRDs includes that: (1)\nits nuclear spectrum shows a clear \"V-shaped\" SED; and (2) when redshifted to\n$z=7$, surface brightness dimming makes the host undetectable, thus mimicking\nan LRD. This suggests that high-redshift LRDs may be embedded in extended\nhosts. To test this, we stack rest-frame UV images of 99 photometrically\nselected LRDs, revealing faint, diffuse emission. Stacking in redshift bins\nreveals mild radial growth, consistent with the expected galaxy size evolution.\nA simple analytic model confirms that surface brightness dimming alone can\nexplain their compact appearance. Lastly, we show that {\\it the Saguaro} is not\nunique by describing similar objects from the literature at $z\\lesssim3.5$.\nTaken together, our results support a scenario in which LRDs may not be a\ndistinct population, but could be the visible nuclei of galaxies undergoing a\nshort-lived, AGN-dominated evolutionary phase, with their compact, red\nappearance driven largely by observational biases.",

While these models have demonstrated successful performance, they\nrequire large amounts of training data to ensure reliability in real-world\nfield deployment. However, data collection is costly, demanding significant\nhuman resources for in-field sampling and annotation. To address this\nchallenge, various data augmentation techniques are commonly employed during\nmodel training, such as color jittering, Gaussian blur, and horizontal flip, to\ndiversify training data and enhance model robustness. In this paper, we\nhypothesize that utilizing only these augmentation techniques may lead to\nsuboptimal performance, particularly in complex under-canopy environments with\nfrequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform spacing of crops. Instead, we\npropose a novel augmentation method, so-called Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut)\nwhich masks random regions out in input images that are spatially distributed\naround crop rows on the sides to encourage trained models to capture high-level\ncontextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed. Our\nextensive experiments with a public cornfield dataset demonstrate that\nmasking-based augmentations are effective for simulating occlusions and\nsignificantly improving robustness in semantic keypoint predictions for visual\nnavigation. In particular, we show that biasing the mask distribution toward\ncrop rows in CA-Cut is critical for enhancing both prediction accuracy and\ngeneralizability across diverse environments achieving up to a 36.9% reduction\nin prediction error.

In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how\ndifferent forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral\ncompressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of\ncompression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the\nrepresentation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective\nperturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound,\nrevealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\\infty$ and $L_2$\nrobustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the\nvulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved -\nwhether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics.\nThrough empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm\nour theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities\npersist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the\nemergence of universal adversarial perturbations.

A quantum monadic\nalgebra is an orthomodular lattice equipped with a closure operator, known as a\nquantifier, whose closed elements form an orthomodular sub-lattice. It is shown\nthat every quantum monadic algebra can be converted into a monadic\nquasi-implication algebra with the underlying magma structure being determined\nby the operation of Sasaki implication on the underlying orthomodular lattice.\nIt is then conversely demonstrated that every monadic quasi-implication algebra\ncan be converted into a quantum monadic algebra. These constructions are shown\nto induce an isomorphism between the category of quantum monadic algebras and\nthe category of monadic quasi-implication algebras.\n  Finally, by generalizing the constructions given by Harding as well as\nHarding, McDonald, and Peinado in the setting of monadic ortholattices, we\nconstruct various monadic orthoframes from monadic quasi-implication algebras.",

    "abstract": "Eliminating warpage in injection molded polymeric parts is one of the most\nimportant problems in the injection molding industry today. This situation is\ncritical in geometries that are particularly susceptible to warping due to\ntheir geometric features, and this occurs with topologies of great length and\nslenderness with high changes in thickness. These features are, in these\nspecial geometries, impossible to manufacture with traditional technologies to\nmeet the dimensional and sustainable requirements of the industry. This paper\npresents an innovative green conformal cooling system that is specifically\ndesigned for parts with slender geometric shapes that are highly susceptible to\nwarping. Additionally, the work presented by the authors investigates the\nimportance of using highly conductive inserts made of steel alloys in\ncombination with the use of additively manufactured conformal channels for\nreducing influential parameters, such as warpage, cooling time, and residual\nstresses in the complex manufacturing of long and slender parts. The results of\nthis real industrial case study indicated that the use of conformal cooling\nlayouts decreased the cycle time by 175.1 s 66% below the current cooling time;\nthe temperature gradient by 78.5% specifically, 18.16 C; the residual stress by\n39.78 MPa or 81.88%; and the warpage by 6.9 mm or 90.5%. In this way, it was\npossible to achieve a final warping in the complex geometry studied of 0.72 mm,\nwhich was under the maximum value required at the industrial level of 1 mm. The\nresulting values obtained by the researchers present a turning point from which\nthe manufacturing and sustainability in the injection molding of said plastic\ngeometries is possible, and they take into account that the geometric\nmanufacturing features analyzed will present a great demand in the coming years\nin the auto parts manufacturing industry.",

This opportunity is one of the rarest natural experiments that\nwe can use to better characterize a small body through telescopic observations\nand space missions. Earlier geological investigations consistently suggested\nthat major geological processes might not occur on Apophis during this closest\nencounter, including surface processing and interior deformation. However,\nminor resurfacing may occur, depending on local geological conditions. A\ncritical finding is that the rotational evolution occurs due to the tidal\neffect from the Earth. The present study offers an additional perspective on\nthe rotational evolution, which may vary due to variations in interior\nproperties. Namely, possible deformation processes may change the spin state\nvariation from the rigid body state, even if deformation is not measurable. The\neffort in this work is to explore this issue using a simplified model,\nmotivated by earlier studies by Hirabayashi (2023) and Taylor et al. (2023).\nThe results show that the deformation-driven spin state change may be possible,\ndepending on Young's modulus. If this asteroid's Young's modulus is ~1 MPa or\nhigher, the spin state only deviates a few degrees from the rigid body state\nover one year. However, if it is ~10 kPa or less, the spin state deviation may\nreach a few degrees, even a few days after the closest encounter.

    "abstract": "Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transient events that are\ntypically observed at radio wavelengths and cosmological distances but their\norigin remains unclear. Furthermore, most FRB origin models are related to the\nprocesses at stellar scales, involving neutron stars, blackholes, supernovae,\netc. In this paper, our purpose is to determine whether multi-structural\none-off FRBs and repeaters share similarities. To achieve this, we focus on\nanalyzing the relationship between the FRB event rate and the star formation\nrate, complemented by statistical testing methods. Based on the CHIME/FRB\nCatalog 1, we calculate the energy functions for four subsamples, including\napparent non-repeating FRBs (one-offs), repeaters, multi-structural one-offs,\nand the joint repeaters and multi-structural events, respectively. We then\nderive the FRB event rates at different redshifts for all four subsamples, all\nof which were found to share a similar cosmological evolution trend. However,\nwe find that the multi-structural one-offs and repeaters are distinguishable\nfrom the KS and MWW tests.",

Our experiments show that HydraOpt significantly reduces storage\nsize (48% reduction) compared to storing all adapters, while achieving\ncompetitive performance (0.2-1.8% drop).

We find the separation distribution\nconsistent with being flat, and we estimate a power-law fit to the mass ratio\ndistribution with index -0.13$^{+0.92}_{-0.95}$ and a companion frequency of\n0.25$^{+0.17}_{-0.11}$ over mass ratios 0.1-1.0 and projected separations\n0.01-27.54au.

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture for scaling Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) efficiently by decoupling total parameters from\ncomputational cost. However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge:\npredicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert\nactivation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address\nthis gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the\ncomputational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a\nlarge-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to\nsystematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural\nconfigurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the\nexpert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following\npredictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator\nwith a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified\nscaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its\nconfiguration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained\nLing-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active\nparameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an\nidentical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance\nof the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources,\nthereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws. This work provides a\nprincipled and empirically-grounded foundation for the scaling of efficient MoE\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human\nmobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban\ngovernance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to\npredict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory\non a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,\nthe vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason\nover maps \\textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent\ndevelopment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong\ncapabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a\nnew possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an\nimage and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to\nperform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we\nfirst propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which\nevaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based\nreasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights\nfrom the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,\nwhich is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and\ntrajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual\ninputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual\nMap Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction\nability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on\ndatasets from four different cities show that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city\ngeneralization compared to other LLM-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "Learning with noisy labels is a crucial task for training accurate deep\nneural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various\nrobust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric\nlosses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict\nconstraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly\noptimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting\nability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding\nadvanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging\ntheoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust\nloss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses.\nHowever, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced\noptimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and\napplicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric\nlosses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario\nand propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We\nrigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE\nsatisfies the asymmetric condition. By substituting the traditional symmetric\npassive loss in APL with our proposed AMSE, we introduce a novel robust loss\nframework termed Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL).

    "abstract": "Graph class-incremental learning (GCIL) allows graph neural networks (GNNs)\nto adapt to evolving graph analytical tasks by incrementally learning new class\nknowledge while retaining knowledge of old classes. Existing GCIL methods\nprimarily focus on a closed-set assumption, where all test samples are presumed\nto belong to previously known classes. Such an assumption restricts their\napplicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge\nduring inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a\nmore challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two\nintertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs\nthe detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which\ndestabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems,\na novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding\ngeneration to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust\ndetection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional\nvariational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old\nclasses, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data. To handle\nunknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate\nout-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node\nembeddings. A novel prototypical hypersphere classification loss is further\nproposed, which anchors in-distribution embeddings to their respective class\nprototypes, while repelling OOD embeddings away. Instead of assigning all\nunknown samples into one cluster, our proposed objective function explicitly\nmodels them as outliers through prototype-aware rejection regions, ensuring a\nrobust open-set recognition.

To enable\nalternative, simulation-based exploration of different stakeholder\nperspectives, we develop the HoPeS (Human-Oriented Perspective Shifting)\nmodelling framework. HoPeS employs agents powered by large language models\n(LLMs) to represent various stakeholders; users can step into the agent roles\nto experience perspectival differences. A simulation protocol serves as a\n\"scaffold\" to streamline multiple perspective-taking simulations, supporting\nusers in reflecting on, transitioning between, and integrating across\nperspectives. A prototype system is developed to demonstrate HoPeS in the\ncontext of institutional dynamics and land use change, enabling both\nnarrative-driven and numerical experiments. In an illustrative experiment, a\nuser successively adopts the perspectives of a system observer and a researcher\n- a role that analyses data from the embedded land use model to inform\nevidence-based decision-making for other LLM agents representing various\ninstitutions. Despite the user's effort to recommend technically sound\npolicies, discrepancies persist between the policy recommendation and\nimplementation due to stakeholders' competing advocacies, mirroring real-world\nmisalignment between researcher and policymaker perspectives. The user's\nreflection highlights the subjective feelings of frustration and disappointment\nas a researcher, especially due to the challenge of maintaining political\nneutrality while attempting to gain political influence. Despite this, the user\nexhibits high motivation to experiment with alternative narrative framing\nstrategies, suggesting the system's potential in exploring different\nperspectives.

    "abstract": "Myocardial motion tracking is important for assessing cardiac function and\ndiagnosing cardiovascular diseases, for which cine cardiac magnetic resonance\n(CMR) has been established as the gold standard imaging modality. Many existing\nmethods learn motion from single image pairs consisting of a reference frame\nand a randomly selected target frame from the cardiac cycle. However, these\nmethods overlook the continuous nature of cardiac motion and often yield\ninconsistent and non-smooth motion estimations. In this work, we propose a\nnovel Mamba-based cardiac motion tracking network (MCM) that explicitly\nincorporates target image sequence from the cardiac cycle to achieve smooth and\ntemporally consistent motion tracking. By developing a bi-directional Mamba\nblock equipped with a bi-directional scanning mechanism, our method facilitates\nthe estimation of plausible deformation fields. With our proposed motion\ndecoder that integrates motion information from frames adjacent to the target\nframe, our method further enhances temporal coherence. Moreover, by taking\nadvantage of Mamba's structured state-space formulation, the proposed method\nlearns the continuous dynamics of the myocardium from sequential images without\nincreasing computational complexity. We evaluate the proposed method on two\npublic datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method\nquantitatively and qualitatively outperforms both conventional and\nstate-of-the-art learning-based cardiac motion tracking methods.

In this work, we employ density\nfunctional theory with a hybrid functional to study the energetics of possible\npoint defects in Ge. Our findings indicate that n-type group-V impurities, such\nas phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), and antimony (Sb), form more readily in Ge\ncompared to nitrogen (N), Ge vacancies, and Ge interstitials. Unlike N dopants,\nwhich yield deep trap states, P, As, and Sb create shallow traps close to the\nconduction band edge of Ge. Furthermore, we predict that n-type defects can\ncondense into defect complexes with Ge vacancies. These vacancy-impurity\ncomplexes form deep traps in Ge, similar to Ge vacancies, suggesting that both\nvacancies and vacancy-impurity complexes contribute to charge trapping in these\ndetectors, thereby diminishing their performance.",

    "abstract": "The process of meta-learning algorithms from data, instead of relying on\nmanual design, is growing in popularity as a paradigm for improving the\nperformance of machine learning systems. Meta-learning shows particular promise\nfor reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are often adapted from\nsupervised or unsupervised learning despite their suboptimality for RL.\nHowever, until now there has been a severe lack of comparison between different\nmeta-learning algorithms, such as using evolution to optimise over black-box\nfunctions or LLMs to propose code. In this paper, we carry out this empirical\ncomparison of the different approaches when applied to a range of meta-learned\nalgorithms which target different parts of the RL pipeline. In addition to\nmeta-train and meta-test performance, we also investigate factors including the\ninterpretability, sample cost and train time for each meta-learning algorithm.\nBased on these findings, we propose several guidelines for meta-learning new RL\nalgorithms which will help ensure that future learned algorithms are as\nperformant as possible.",

We contribute two large-scale datasets with dense\nper-annotator labels: STREET (4,300 labels/annotator) and AMER (average 3,118\nlabels/annotator), the first multimodal multi-annotator dataset. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of our QuMAB in modeling individual\nannotators' behavior patterns, their utility for consensus prediction, and\napplicability under sparse annotations.",

In this work,\nwe introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD\nrobustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative\nnuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual\nnuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion\nmodels. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that\noutperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with\ngenerative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study\nto evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance\nshifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model\nrankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be\ncaptured when applying common binary shifts. Additionally, we show that\nevaluating the model performance on a continuous scale allows the\nidentification of model failure points, providing a more nuanced understanding\nof model robustness.

Kinematically, the natural knee is complex, with\ntranslation and rotation components that have a substantial impact on gait\ncharacteristics. When simplified to a pin joint, some of this behaviour is\nlost. This study investigates the role of cruciate ligament stretch in event\ndetection. A bicondylar knee design was used, constrained by analogues of the\nanterior and posterior cruciate ligaments. This offers the ability to\ncharacterize knee kinematics by the stretch of the ligaments. The ligament\nstretch was recorded using LVDTs parallel to the ligaments of the Russell knee\non a bent knee crutch. Which was used to capture data on a treadmill at 3\nspeeds. This study finds speed dependence within the stretch of the cruciate\nligaments, prominently around 5\\% and 80\\% of the gait cycle for the posterior\nand anterior. The cycle profile remains consistent with speed; therefore, other\nstatic events such as the turning point feature at around 90\\% and 95\\% of the\ncycle, for the posterior and anterior, respectively, could be used as a\npredictive precursor for initial contact. Likewise at 90\\% and 95\\%, another\npair of turning points that in this case could be used to predict foot flat.\nThis concludes that the use of a bicondylar knee design could improve the\ndetection of events during the gait cycle, and therefore could increase the\naccuracy of subsequent controllers for powered prosthetics.",

To scale beyond\nbillions of high-dimensional vectors, the index must be distributed. The\ndisaggregated memory architecture physically separates compute and memory into\ntwo distinct hardware units and has become popular in modern data centers. Both\nunits are connected via RDMA networks that allow compute nodes to directly\naccess remote memory and perform all the computations, posing unique challenges\nfor disaggregated indexes.\n  In this work, we propose a scalable HNSW index for ANN search in\ndisaggregated memory. In contrast to existing distributed approaches, which\npartition the graph at the cost of accuracy, our method builds a\ngraph-preserving index that reaches the same accuracy as a single-machine HNSW.\nContinuously fetching high-dimensional vector data from remote memory leads to\nsevere network bandwidth limitations, which we overcome by employing an\nefficient caching mechanism. Since answering a single query involves processing\nnumerous unique graph nodes, caching alone is not sufficient to achieve high\nscalability.

By representing 3D coordinates as quaternions, the method\nconstructs a rank-1 Gram edge kernel (GEK) matrix that integrates both relative\ndistance and angular information between nodes, which enhances the noise\nreduction effect achieved through low-rank truncation employing singular value\ndecomposition (SVD), thereby improving robustness against information loss. To\nfurther reduce computational complexity, we also propose a variant of QD-SMDS\nthat eliminates the need for the computationally expensive SVD by leveraging\nthe inherent structure of the quaternion-domain GEK matrix. This alternative\ndirectly estimates node coordinates using only matrix multiplications within\nthe quaternion domain.

    "abstract": "While ferromagnet and topological material bilayers are widely studied to\nobtain efficient spin charge conversion via topological surface states (TSS),\nthe influence of the magnetic proximity effect (MPE) on the TSS evolution and\nconversion efficiency remains poorly understood. In this study, we\nexperimentally probe and reveal the behavior of spin momentum locked TSS\nthrough spin pumping measurements in heterostructures composed of ferromagnetic\nFe and the topological Dirac semimetal alpha Sn. As the alpha Sn thickness\n(tSn) increases from 9 to 35 nm, the Gilbert damping constant of the Fe layer\nexhibits a pronounced peak at tSn = 25 nm, followed by a decrease at greater\nthicknesses. Our rigorous theoretical analysis, combining analytical modeling\nand first principles calculations, attributes this behavior to the TSS\ndisappearance at the Fe and alpha Sn interface and exchange gap opening on the\nopposite surface, both induced by the long range MPE and its influence on the\nspin charge conversion efficiency. At tSn = 25 nm, we demonstrate highly\nefficient spin charge conversion with an inverse Edelstein length of 3.14 nm,\nthe highest value reported at room temperature for ferromagnet and topological\nmaterial bilayers. These findings underscore the critical role of tuning TSS\nproperties under MPE for advancing topological materials in spintronic\napplications.",

This setting is\nparticularly relevant when there are limited observations (e.g., short\ntrajectories) from individual data sources, making direct estimation\nchallenging. In such cases, incorporating data from multiple related sources\ncan improve learning. We propose an estimation algorithm that leverages\ndifferent data requirements for the tasks of clustering and system\nidentification. First, short impulse responses are estimated from individual\ntrajectories and clustered. Then, refined models for each cluster are jointly\nestimated using multiple trajectories.

Using benchmark datasets\nin ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with\nnative-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine\nlearning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the\nlargest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18\nmillion tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017\nand 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing\nparties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme\nand populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in\nsignificantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our\nunderstanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication\nin multiparty systems.

This study introduces a data-driven methodology for quantifying the\nreturn on investment (ROI) of CTI, thereby reframing it as a measurable\ncontributor to risk mitigation. The proposed framework extends established\nmodels in security economics, including the Gordon-Loeb and FAIR models, to\naccount for CTI's complex influence on both the probability of security\nbreaches and the severity of associated losses. The framework is\noperationalized through empirically grounded performance indicators, such as\nreductions in mean time to detect (MTTD), mean time to respond (MTTR), and\nadversary dwell time, supported by three sector-specific case studies in\nfinance, healthcare, and retail. To address limitations in conventional linear\nassessment methodologies, the Threat Intelligence Effectiveness Index (TIEI) is\nintroduced as a composite metric based on a weighted geometric mean. TIEI\npenalizes underperformance across critical dimensions: quality, enrichment,\nintegration, and operational impact; thereby capturing bottleneck effect where\nthe least effective component limits overall performance. By integrating\nfinancial quantification, adversarial coverage, and qualitative assessments of\nbusiness enablement, the proposed hybrid model converts negative evidence into\na justifiable ROI explanation.

    "abstract": "Wi-Fi sensing offers a promising technique for contactless human respiration\nmonitoring. A key challenge, however, is the blind spot problem caused by\nrandom phase offsets that corrupt the complementarity of respiratory signals.\nTo address the challenge, we propose a single-antenna-Wi-Fi-sensing\n(SA-WiSense) framework to improve accuracy of human respiration monitoring,\nrobust against random phase offsets. The proposed SA-WiSense framework is\ncost-efficient, as only a single antenna is used rather than multiple antennas\nas in the previous works. Therefore, the proposed framework is applicable to\nInternet of Thing (IoT), where most of sensors are equipped with a single\nantenna. On one hand, we propose a cross-subcarrier channel state information\n(CSI) ratio (CSCR) based blind spot mitigation approach for IoT, where the\nratios of two values of CSI between subcarriers are leveraged to mitigate\nrandom phase offsets. We prove that the random phase offsets can be cancelled\nby the proposed CSCR approach, thereby restoring the inherent complementarity\nof signals for blind-spot-free sensing. On the other hand, we propose a genetic\nalgorithm (GA) based subcarrier selection (GASS) approach by formulating an\noptimization problem in terms of the sensing-signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) of\nCSCR between subcarriers. GA is utilized to solve the formulated optimization\nproblem. We use commodity ESP32 microcontrollers to build an experiment test.\nThe proposed works are validated to achieve an detection rate of 91.2% for\nrespiration monitoring at distances up to 8.0 meters, substantially more\naccurate than the state-of-the-art methods with a single antenna.",

However, despite\nthe detection of energy-dependent morphologies in many TeV sources, we lack a\nproper quantification of such measurements. We introduce an estimation tool\nwithin the Gammapy landscape, an open-source Python package for the analysis of\ngamma-ray data, for quantifying the energy-dependent morphology of a gamma-ray\nsource. The proposed method fits the spatial morphology in a global fit across\nall energy slices (null hypothesis) and compares this to separate fits for each\nenergy slice (alternative hypothesis). These are modelled using forward-folding\nmethods, and the significance of the variability is quantified by comparing the\ntest statistics of the two hypotheses. We present a general tool for probing\nchanges in the spatial morphology with energy, employing a full forward-folding\napproach with a 3D likelihood. We present its usage on a real dataset from\nH.E.S.S. and on a simulated dataset to quantify the significance of the energy\ndependence for sources of different sizes. In the first example, which utilises\na subset of data from HESSJ1825-137, we observe extended emission at lower\nenergies that becomes more compact at higher energies. The tool indicates a\nvery significant variability (9.8{\\sigma}) in the case of the largely extended\nemission. In the second example, a source with a smaller extent (~0.1{\\deg}),\nsimulated using the CTAO response, shows the tool can still provide a\nstatistically significant variation (9.7{\\sigma}) on small scales.",

Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have\ndemonstrated remarkable capabilities in computer vision tasks, yet their\nalignment with human visual attention patterns remains underexplored,\nparticularly in aesthetic contexts. This study investigates the correlation\nbetween human visual attention and ViT attention mechanisms when evaluating\nhandcrafted objects. We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30\nparticipants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal\nobjects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs\neye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing\nhuman visual attention. Simultaneously, we analyzed the same objects using a\npre-trained ViT model with DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO Labels), extracting\nattention maps from each of the 12 attention heads. We compared human and ViT\nattention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying\nGaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal\ncorrelation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest\nalignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found\nbetween attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest\ndivergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate\nthat while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal\nattention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior,\nparticularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items.

We used the gas-grain chemical model\n\\texttt{Nautilus} to reproduce the observed abundance profiles adjusting\nparameters such as initial sulfur abundances and binding energies. H$_{2}$S,\nN$_{2}$H$^{+}$ and C$^{18}$O gas-phase abundances vary up to one order of\nmagnitude towards the extinction peak. CH$_{3}$OH abundance remains quite\nuniform. These abundances can only be reproduced assuming a decreasing sulfur\nbudget, which lowers H$_{2}$S and enhances CH$_{3}$OH abundances. Decreasing\nbinding energies, which are expected in CO-rich apolar ices, are also required.\nThe sulfur depletion required by H$_2$S is generally higher than that required\nby CH$_3$OH, suggesting unknown sulfur sinks. These findings highlight the\nintricate relationship between sulfur chemistry and COM formation, driven by\nthe competition between sulfur and CO for hydrogen atoms. Our study emphasizes\nthat the growth of CO ice and the progressive sequestration of hydrogen atoms\nby sulfur are critical in determining whether chemical complexity can develop,\nproviding key insights into the early stages of star and planet formation.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of the neural implicit representation has notably propelled\nthe advancement of online dense reconstruction techniques. Compared to\ntraditional explicit representations, such as TSDF, it improves the mapping\ncompleteness and memory efficiency. However, the lack of reconstruction details\nand the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread\napplication of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We\nintroduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene\nreconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and\nlarge-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a\nresidual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and\nan implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained\ndetails to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for\ndetail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting\nwith the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus\npaving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the\nresidual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via\nbundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize\nposes directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel\ntechnique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better\noptimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local\nmoving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a\ndivide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our\nresidual-based framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nsurpasses all state-of-the-art ones, including those based either on explicit\nor implicit representations, in terms of the accuracy of both mapping and\ntracking on large-scale scenes.",

To address these issues, we propose the encrypted-state quantum\ncompilation scheme based on quantum circuit obfuscation (ECQCO), the first\nsecure compilation framework tailored for the co-location of compilers and\nquantum hardware. It applies quantum homomorphic encryption to conceal output\nstates and instantiates a structure obfuscation mechanism based on quantum\nindistinguishability obfuscation, effectively protecting both functionality and\ntopology of the circuit. Additionally, an adaptive decoupling obfuscation\nalgorithm is designed to suppress potential idle errors while inserting pulse\noperations. The proposed scheme achieves information-theoretic security and\nguarantees computational indistinguishability under the quantum random oracle\nmodel. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that ECQCO achieves a\nTVD of up to 0.7 and a normalized GED of 0.88, enhancing compilation-stage\nsecurity.

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has significantly\nincreased demand on both transportation and power systems, posing challenges to\ntheir stable operation. To support the growing need for EV charging, both fixed\ncharging stations (FCSs) and mobile charging stations (MCSs) have been\nintroduced, serving as key interfaces between the power grid and traffic\nnetwork. Recognizing the importance of collaborative planning across these\nsectors, this paper presents a two-stage joint planning model for FCSs and\nMCSs, utilizing an improved alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)\nalgorithm. The primary goal of the proposed model is to transform the potential\nnegative impacts of large-scale EV integration into positive outcomes, thereby\nenhancing social welfare through collaboration among multiple stakeholders. In\nthe first stage, we develop a framework for evaluating FCS locations,\nincorporating assessments of EV hosting capacity and voltage stability. The\nsecond stage introduces a joint planning model for FCSs and MCSs, aiming to\nminimize the overall social costs of the EV charging system while maintaining a\nreliable power supply. To solve the planning problem, we employ a combination\nof mixed-integer linear programming, queueing theory, and sequential quadratic\nprogramming. The improved ADMM algorithm couples the siting and sizing\ndecisions consistently by introducing coupling constraints, and supports a\ndistributed optimization framework that coordinates the interests of EV users,\nMCS operators, and distribution system operators. Additionally, a flexible\ncapacity planning strategy that accounts for the multi-period development\npotential of EVCS is proposed to reduce both the complexity and the investment\nrequired for FCS construction. Finally, a case study with comparative\nexperiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed models and solution\nmethods.",

In this work, we consider two- and\nthree-site Kitaev chains and investigate the dynamics of bipartite and\nmultipartite entanglement by means of concurrence and geometric measure of\nentanglement. In two-site Kitaev chains, we find that maximally entangled\nstates can robustly emerge, with their stability and periodicity highly\ncontrollable by the interplay between the superconducting pair potential and\nthe onsite energies. At the finely tuned sweet spot, where Majorana\nquasiparticles appear, the system exhibits oscillations between separable and\nentangled states, whereas detuning introduces tunable valleys in the\nentanglement dynamics. Extending to the three-site Kitaev chain, we uncover\nrich bipartite and multipartite entanglement by generalizing the concepts of\nconcurrence and geometric measure of entanglement. At the sweet spot, the\nMajorana quasiparticles emerging at the edges suppress concurrence between the\nedges, while a finite detuning is able to restore it. Depending on the initial\nstate, the three-site Kitaev chain can dynamically generate either a maximally\nentangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state or an imperfect W-type state\nexhibiting multipartite entanglement, although a (maximally entangled) pure W\nstate cannot be realised due to parity constraints.

Importantly, we demonstrate that the redundant doubled\nconfiguration space admits a gauge freedom at the level of the canonical\nmomenta that leaves the physical dynamics unchanged. From a Legendre transform,\nwe construct the corresponding family of gauge-related nonconservative\nHamiltonians; we show that virtually any classical initial-value problem can be\nembedded on our enlarged symplectic manifold, supplying the associated\nHamiltonian and Lagrangian functions explicitly. As a further contribution, we\nderive a completely equivalent linear ``Lie'' formulation of the\ndouble-variable action and Hamiltonian which streamlines computations and\nrenders transparent many structural properties of the formalism.",

The central open question in this area is to understand the soundness\nof this compiler against quantum strategies, and apart from results for\nspecific games, all that is known is the recent \"qualitative\" result of Kulpe\net al. (STOC '25) showing that the success probability of a quantum prover in\nthe compiled game is bounded by the game's quantum commuting-operator value in\nthe limit as the cryptographic security parameter goes to infinity. In this\nwork, we make progress towards a quantitative understanding of quantum\nsoundness for general games, by giving a concrete framework to bound the\nquantum value of compiled nonlocal games. Building on the result of Kulpe et\nal. together with the notion of \"nice\" sum-of-squares certificates, introduced\nby Natarajan and Zhang (FOCS '23) to bound the value of the compiled CHSH game,\nwe extend the niceness framework and construct a hierarchy of semidefinite\nprograms that searches exclusively over nice certificates. We show that this\nhierarchy converges to the optimal quantum value of the game.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has become increasingly popular across different\nsectors, offering a way for clients to work together to train a global model\nwithout sharing sensitive data. It involves multiple rounds of communication\nbetween the global model and participating clients, which introduces several\nchallenges like high communication costs, heterogeneous client data, prolonged\nprocessing times, and increased vulnerability to privacy threats. In recent\nyears, the convergence of federated learning and parameterized quantum circuits\nhas sparked significant research interest, with promising implications for\nfields such as healthcare and finance. By enabling decentralized training of\nquantum models, it allows clients or institutions to collaboratively enhance\nmodel performance and outcomes while preserving data privacy. Recognizing that\nFisher information can quantify the amount of information that a quantum state\ncarries under parameter changes, thereby providing insight into its geometric\nand statistical properties. We intend to leverage this property to address the\naforementioned challenges. In this work, we propose a Quantum Federated\nLearning (QFL) algorithm that makes use of the Fisher information computed on\nlocal client models, with data distributed across heterogeneous partitions.\nThis approach identifies the critical parameters that significantly influence\nthe quantum model's performance, ensuring they are preserved during the\naggregation process. Our research assessed the effectiveness and feasibility of\nQFL by comparing its performance against other variants, and exploring the\nbenefits of incorporating Fisher information in QFL settings.

One effective approach is to search for the optimal ray direction\nfrom the benign image that minimizes the $\\ell_p$-norm distance to the\nadversarial region. The unique advantage of this approach is that it transforms\nthe hard-label attack into a continuous optimization problem. The objective\nfunction value is the ray's radius, which can be obtained via binary search at\na high query cost. Existing methods use a \"sign trick\" in gradient estimation\nto reduce the number of queries. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the\nquality of this gradient estimation and propose a novel prior-guided approach\nto improve ray search efficiency both theoretically and empirically.\nSpecifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and\nour gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the\nprojection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and\nrandom directions, in a query-efficient manner. We theoretically derive the\nexpected cosine similarities between the obtained gradient estimators and the\ntrue gradient, and demonstrate the improvement achieved by incorporating\npriors.

    "abstract": "Numerical simulations of turbulent flows at realistic Reynolds numbers\ngenerally rely on filtering out small scales from the Navier Stokes equations\nand modeling their impact through the Reynolds stress tensor ${\\tau}_{ij}$.\nTraditional models approximate ${\\tau}_{ij}$ solely as a function of the\nfiltered velocity gradient, leading to deterministic subgrid scale closures.\nHowever, small scale fluctuations can locally exhibit instantaneous values\nwhose deviation from the mean can have a significant influence on flow\ndynamics. In this work, we investigate these effects by employing direct\nnumerical simulations combined with Gaussian filtering to quantify subgrid\nscale effects and evaluating the local energy flux in both space and time. The\nmean performance of the canonical Clark model is assessed by conditioning the\nenergy flux distributions on the invariants of the filtered velocity gradient\ntensor, $Q$ and $R$. The Clark model captures to a good degree the mean energy\nflux. However, the fluctuations around these mean values for given ($Q,R$) are\nof the order of the mean displaying fat tailed distributions. To become more\nprecise, we examine the joint distributions of true energy flux and the\npredictions from both the Clark and the Smagorinsky models. This approach\nmirrors the strategy adopted in early stochastic subgrid scale models. Clear\nnon Gaussian characteristics emerge from the obtained distributions,\nparticularly through the appearance of heavy tails. The mean, the variance, the\nskewness and flatness of these distributions are quantified. Our results\nemphasize that fluctuations are an integral component of the small scale\nfeedback onto large scale dynamics and should be incorporated into subgrid\nscale modeling through an appropriate stochastic framework.",

    "abstract": "The Periodic Event Scheduling Problem (PESP) is a fundamental model in\nperiodic timetabling for public transport systems, assuming a common period\nacross all events. However, real-world networks often feature heterogeneous\nservice frequencies. This paper studies the Multiperiodic Event Scheduling\nProblem (MPESP), a generalization of PESP that allows each event to recur at\nits own individual period. While more expressive, MPESP presents new modeling\nchallenges due to the loss of a global period. We present a cycle-based\nformulation for MPESP that extends the strongest known formulation for PESP\nand, in contrast to existing approaches, is valid for any MPESP instance.\nCrucially, the formulation requires a cycle basis derived from a spanning tree\nsatisfying specific structural properties, which we formalize and\nalgorithmically construct, extending the concept of sharp spanning trees to\nrooted instances. We further prove a multiperiodic analogue of the cycle\nperiodicity property. Our new formulation solves nearly all tested instances,\nincluding several large-scale real-world public transport networks, to\noptimality or with small optimality gaps, dramatically outperforming existing\narc-based models. The results demonstrate the practical potential of MPESP in\ncapturing heterogeneous frequencies without resorting to artificial event\nduplication.",

Our global well-posedness result bridges the gap\nand matches the threshold in the local theory. The main novelty of our approach\nis to introduce a pair of distinct $I$-operators, tailored to the resonant\nstructure of the Majda-Biello system with $\\alpha=4$. This dual-operator\nframework allows for pointwise control of the multipliers in the modified\nenergies constructed via the multilinear correction technique. These modified\nenergies are almost conserved and provide effective control over the Sobolev\nnorm of the solution globally in time.

Although in-plane components of the total\npolarization in the bulk vanish due to global symmetry constraints, each\nCrI$_2$ single layer exhibits local electric polarization along the $x$\ndirection, arising from the generalized spin-current mechanism, which couples\nspin chirality to the electric polarization.

Heat pump and thermal energy\nstorage (HPTES) systems, being energy efficient solutions, are becoming popular\nin modern buildings and are promising to contribute to demand-side management\n(DSM) due to their significant share in household electricity consumption. For\ntypical HPTES systems, this paper presents a systematic design framework\ncovering a control-oriented modeling process and energy-flexible model\npredictive control (MPC) design. The proposed MPC-based DSM strategy offers an\ninnovative solution for efficient DSM by following a two-step DSM framework. In\nthe first step, flexibility assessment is performed to quantitatively evaluate\nthe flexibility potential of the HPTES system by solving a mixed-integer\neconomic MPC problem. In the second step, flexibility exploitation is achieved\nthrough reacting to feasible demand response (DR) requests while respecting\nsystem constraints. Both numerical simulations and real-world experiments are\nperformed based on a real HPTES installation to showcase the viability and\neffectiveness of the proposed design.",

Such extreme properties challenge conventional\nstellar evolution models predicting a black hole mass gap due to\npair-instability supernovae. We analyze GW231123 using population-informed\npriors on BH mass and spin distributions to test possible formation scenarios:\nfirst-generation stellar collapse, hierarchical (multi-generation) mergers, and\nprimordial origin. Our analysis strongly prefers scenarios where at least one\ncomponent is a higher-generation BH. Both components are favored to have high\nspins, which rules out scenarios in which they are both first-generation (low\nspin) or primordial (nearly non-spin). We conclude that GW231123 is a\nhierarchical merger, with components plausibly originate from the successive\nmergers of $\\sim 6$ and $\\sim 4$ first-generation BHs, respectively. This\nsuggests that repeated mergers can be frequent and even more massive\nintermediate-mass black holes may be produced.

    "abstract": "Code reasoning is a fundamental capability for large language models (LLMs)\nin the code domain. It involves understanding and predicting a program's\nexecution behavior, such as determining the output for a given input or whether\na specific statement will be executed. This capability is essential for\ndownstream tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair. Prior\napproaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code\nreasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize\nacross diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low\nquality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which\nstruggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we\npropose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a\ntwo-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets\nthat focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply\ninstruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a\npowerful teacher model. We then enhance reasoning and generalization through\nGRPO reinforcement learning on top of the fine-tuned model. Experiments on\nthree widely-used code reasoning benchmarks show that CodeReasoner improves\nperformance by 27.1% to 40.2% over prior methods using a 7B model. Notably, the\n7B model matches GPT-4o on key tasks like input/output and coverage prediction.\nWhen scaled to 14B, CodeReasoner outperforms GPT-4o across all benchmarks.\nAblation studies confirm the effectiveness of each training stage and highlight\nthe importance of reasoning chains.",

It is shown that flow in the wake\nregion is greatly influenced by the Stefan flow, as higher evaporation rates\nlead to earlier flow separation and a larger recirculation zone behind the\ndroplet. Under strong convection, the models fail to capture the evaporation\nrate, especially in the wake region, which leads to significant discrepancies\ncompared to interface-resolved simulations. Droplet deformation greatly\ninfluences the flow field around the droplet and generally enhances\nevaporation, but the evaporation rate remains well correlated with the surface\narea.

However, existing\nmulti-modal pre-training frameworks primarily rely on a single pre-training\ntask to gather multi-modal data in 3D applications. This limitation prevents\nthe models from obtaining the abundant information provided by other relevant\ntasks, which can hinder their performance in downstream tasks, particularly in\ncomplex and diverse domains. In order to tackle this issue, we propose MMPT, a\nMulti-modal Multi-task Pre-training framework designed to enhance point cloud\nunderstanding. Specifically, three pre-training tasks are devised: (i)\nToken-level reconstruction (TLR) aims to recover masked point tokens, endowing\nthe model with representative learning abilities. (ii) Point-level\nreconstruction (PLR) is integrated to predict the masked point positions\ndirectly, and the reconstructed point cloud can be considered as a transformed\npoint cloud used in the subsequent task. (iii) Multi-modal contrastive learning\n(MCL) combines feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus\nassembling a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image\nmodalities in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, this framework operates\nwithout requiring any 3D annotations, making it scalable for use with large\ndatasets. The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various\ndownstream tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluated its\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods in various discriminant and\ngenerative applications under widely-used benchmarks.",

In this work, we propose a coincidence double-tip\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) that enables direct probing of spatially\nresolved dynamical two-body correlations of sample electrons. Unlike\nconventional single-tip scanning tunneling microscopy, the double-tip STS\nemploys a double-tip scanning tunneling microscope (STM) equipped with two\nindependently controlled tips, each biased at distinct voltages ($V_1$ and\n$V_2$). By simultaneously measuring the quantum tunneling currents $I_1(t)$ and\n$I_2(t)$ at locations $j_1$ and $j_2$, we obtain a coincidence tunneling\ncurrent correlation $\\overline{\\langle I_1(t) I_2(t)\\rangle}$. Differentiating\nthis coincidence tunneling current correlation with respect to the two bias\nvoltages yields a coincidence dynamical conductance. Through the development of\na nonequilibrium theory, we demonstrate that this coincidence dynamical\nconductance is proportional to a contour-ordered second-order current\ncorrelation function. For the sample electrons in a nearly free Fermi liquid\nstate, the coincidence dynamical conductance captures two correlated dynamical\nelectron propagation processes: (i) from $j_1$ to $j_2$ (or vice versa) driven\nby $V_1$, and (ii) from $j_2$ to $j_1$ (or vice versa) driven by $V_2$. For the\nsample electrons in a superconducting state, additional propagation channels\nemerge from the superconducting condensate, coexisting with the above normal\nelectron propagation processes. Thus, the coincidence double-tip STS provides\ndirect access to spatially resolved dynamical two-body correlations, offering a\npowerful tool for investigating strongly correlated electron systems.",

To date, the hydrogen Balmer lines remain the most consistent way to\nclassify galaxies, but at 'intermediate' redshifts ($1.5 < z < 2.5$), galaxies\nare hard to parse in the BPT diagram (and its siblings) because the crucial\nH$\\alpha$ emission line is out of range of ground-based optical spectographs.\nIn this work, we re-explore a known diagram, which we call the OB-I diagram,\nthat compares the equivalent width of H$\\beta$ with the emission line ratio of\n[OIII]$\\lambda$5007/H$\\beta$, and breathe new life into it, as it has the\npotential to 'illuminate the fog' that permeates galaxy classification in the\nrestframe optical spectra. Using data from SDSS, LEGA-C, VANDELS, JADES, 3D-HST\nand MOSDEF, we explore galaxy classification in the OB-I diagram at a wide\nrange of redshifts ($0 < z < 2.7$). We find that, at $z < 0.4$, the OB-I\ndiagram clearly separates galaxies between two distinct types, which we divide\nwith an empirical fit: one dominated by AGN and a second made up of a mixed\npopulation of SF galaxies and AGN activity. This mixed population can be\npartially separated from a pure SF population, with a simple semi-empirical fit\nderived from a comparison with theoretical models and the BPT diagrams. At\nhigher redshifts, we find that the majority of AGNs identified by other\nclassification schemes are correctly recovered by the OB-I diagram, potentially\nmaking this diagram resistant to the 'cosmic shift' that plagues most optical\nclassification schemes. Overall, the OB-I diagram, which only requires two\nemission lines to be implemented, is a useful tool at separating galaxies that\npossess a dominating AGN component in their emission from others, from the\nLocal Universe ($z < 0.1$) to the Cosmic Noon ($z \\sim 2$), without any need\nfor significant adjustments in our empirical fit.",

    "abstract": "Building energy modeling is a key tool for optimizing the performance of\nbuilding energy systems. Historically, a wide spectrum of methods has been\nexplored -- ranging from conventional physics-based models to purely\ndata-driven techniques. Recently, hybrid approaches that combine the strengths\nof both paradigms have gained attention. These include strategies such as\nlearning surrogates for physics-based models, modeling residuals between\nsimulated and observed data, fine-tuning surrogates with real-world\nmeasurements, using physics-based outputs as additional inputs for data-driven\nmodels, and integrating the physics-based output into the loss function the\ndata-driven model. Despite this progress, two significant research gaps remain.\nFirst, most hybrid methods focus on deterministic modeling, often neglecting\nthe inherent uncertainties caused by factors like weather fluctuations and\noccupant behavior. Second, there has been little systematic comparison within a\nprobabilistic modeling framework. This study addresses these gaps by evaluating\nfive representative hybrid approaches for probabilistic building energy\nmodeling, focusing on quantile predictions of building thermodynamics in a\nreal-world case study. Our results highlight two main findings. First, the\nperformance of hybrid approaches varies across different building room types,\nbut residual learning with a Feedforward Neural Network performs best on\naverage. Notably, the residual approach is the only model that produces\nphysically intuitive predictions when applied to out-of-distribution test data.\nSecond, Quantile Conformal Prediction is an effective procedure for calibrating\nquantile predictions in case of indoor temperature modeling.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography(EEG) based emotion recognition holds great promise for\naffective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs), yet practical deployment remains\nchallenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and the lack of\nlabeled data in target domains. To overcome these limitations, we present a\nnovel unsupervised Semantic-Dynamic Consistency domain adaptation network for\nfully label-free cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. First, we introduce a\nSame-Subject Same-Trial Mixup strategy that generates augmented samples via\nintra-trial interpolation, enhancing data diversity while explicitly preserving\nindividual identity to mitigate label ambiguity. Second, we construct a dynamic\ndistribution alignment module in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS),\njointly aligning marginal and conditional distributions through multi-objective\nkernel mean embedding, and leveraging a confidence-aware pseudo-labeling\nstrategy to ensure stable adaptation. Third, we propose a dual-domain\nsimilarity consistency learning mechanism that enforces cross-domain structural\nconstraints based on latent pairwise similarities, enabling semantic boundary\nlearning without relying on temporal synchronization or label priors. To\nvalidate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed SDC-Net, extensive\nexperiments are conducted on three widely used EEG benchmark datasets: SEED,\nSEED-IV, and Faced. Comparative results against existing unsupervised domain\nadaptation methods demonstrate that SDC-Net achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in emotion recognition under both cross-subject and cross-session\nconditions. This advancement significantly improves the accuracy and\ngeneralization capability of emotion decoding, and lays a solid foundation for\nreal-world applications of personalized affective brain-computer interfaces\n(aBCIs).

These\nmulti-attribute datasets are vital for analytics but pose significant privacy\nrisks. Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is a powerful tool to protect user data\nprivacy by allowing users to locally perturb their records before releasing to\nan untrusted data aggregator. However, existing LDP mechanisms either split the\nprivacy budget across all attributes or treat each attribute independently,\nignoring natural inter-attribute correlations. This leads to excessive noise or\nfragmented budgets, resulting in significant utility loss, particularly in\nhigh-dimensional settings.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Correlated Randomized Response\n(Corr-RR), a novel LDP mechanism that leverages correlations among attributes\nto substantially improve utility while maintaining rigorous LDP guarantees.\nCorr-RR allocates the full privacy budget to perturb a single, randomly\nselected attribute and reconstructs the remaining attributes using estimated\ninterattribute dependencies, without incurring additional privacy cost. To\nenable this, Corr-RR operates in two phases: (1) a subset of users apply\nstandard LDP mechanisms to estimate correlations, and (2) each remaining user\nperturbs one attribute and infers the others using the learned correlations. We\ntheoretically prove that Corr-RR satisfies $\\epsilon$-LDP, and extensive\nexperiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Corr-RR\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art LDP mechanisms, particularly in\nscenarios with many attributes and strong inter-attribute correlations.",

    "abstract": "Evolving AI systems increasingly deploy multi-agent architectures where\nautonomous agents collaborate, share information, and delegate tasks through\ndeveloping protocols. This connectivity, while powerful, introduces novel\nsecurity risks. One such risk is a cascading risk: a breach in one agent can\ncascade through the system, compromising others by exploiting inter-agent\ntrust. In tandem with OWASP's initiative for an Agentic AI Vulnerability\nScoring System we define an attack vector, Agent Cascading Injection, analogous\nto Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius, operating across networks of agents. In\nan ACI attack, a malicious input or tool exploit injected at one agent leads to\ncascading compromises and amplified downstream effects across agents that trust\nits outputs. We formalize this attack with an adversarial goal equation and key\nvariables (compromised agent, injected exploit, polluted observations, etc.),\ncapturing how a localized vulnerability can escalate into system-wide failure.\nWe then analyze ACI's properties -- propagation chains, amplification factors,\nand inter-agent compound effects -- and map these to OWASP's emerging Agentic\nAI risk categories (e.g. Impact Chain and Orchestration Exploits). Finally, we\nargue that ACI highlights a critical need for quantitative benchmarking\nframeworks to evaluate the security of agent-to-agent communication protocols.\nWe outline a methodology for stress-testing multi-agent systems (using\narchitectures such as Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP) against cascading trust\nfailures, developing upon groundwork for measurable, standardized\nagent-to-agent security evaluation. Our work provides the necessary apparatus\nfor engineers to benchmark system resilience, make data-driven architectural\ntrade-offs, and develop robust defenses against a new generation of agentic\nthreats.",

Despite this, the interplay among these reasoning\nskills under reinforcement learning remains poorly understood. To bridge this\ngap, we present a systematic investigation of multi-domain reasoning within the\nRLVR framework, explicitly focusing on three primary domains: mathematical\nreasoning, code generation, and logical puzzle solving. We conduct a\ncomprehensive study comprising four key components: (1) Leveraging the GRPO\nalgorithm and the Qwen-2.5-7B model family, our study thoroughly evaluates the\nmodels' in-domain improvements and cross-domain generalization capabilities\nwhen trained on single-domain datasets. (2) Additionally, we examine the\nintricate interactions including mutual enhancements and conflicts that emerge\nduring combined cross-domain training.

However, parallel inference introduces significant\ncommunication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices,\nlimiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression\nframework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation\nquality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong\ntemporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations,\nsaturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information.\nTo address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that\nencodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via\nResidual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise\nactivation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical\njustification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling\nsubstantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate\nlightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion\nestablishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower\nlatency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On\n4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also\nuniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on\nslow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method.\nCompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings,\nand integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework.

The next two parts focus on how methods from these two fields can be\ncombined and extended to derive new results for models of active particles with\nlong-range interactions. In part two, we study the density of particles in the\nstationary state, in the limit where the number of particles is very large,\nusing an extension of the Dean-Kawasaki equation to run-and-tumble particles\n(RTPs). In the case of the 1D Coulomb interaction (attractive or repulsive), we\nobtain exact expressions for the stationary density for different types of\nconfining potentials, which sheds lights on new non-equilibrium\nphase-transitions. Some results are also obtained for a repulsive 2D Coulomb\ninteraction (log-gas), although the single-file constraint makes the study more\ndifficult in this case. In part three, we focus on the fluctuations at the\ntagged particle level. In the limit of weak noise, we compute exactly and\nanalyze in different regimes a variety of correlation functions of the particle\npositions and interparticle distances, both for the Brownian Riesz gas and for\nits active counterpart, and show that the activity plays an important role both\nat short times and at small distances.

    "abstract": "Transformers have become the de facto backbone of modern deep learning, yet\ntheir training typically demands an advanced optimizer with adaptive learning\nrate like AdamW, rather than a momentum SGDW (mSGDW). Previous works show that\nit is mainly due to a heavy-tailed distribution of the gradients. In this\npaper, we introduce a Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT), which is\nmeticulously engineered to overcome this limitation enabling seamless training\nwith vanilla mSGDW while yielding comparable performance to the Transformers\ntrained via AdamW. To be specific, in DNT, we strategically integrate\nnormalization techniques at proper positions in the Transformers to effectively\nmodulate the Jacobian matrices of each layer, balance the influence of weights,\nactivations, and their interactions, and thus enable the distributions of\ngradients concentrated. We provide both theoretical justifications of the\nnormalization technique used in our DNT and extensive empirical evaluation on\ntwo popular Transformer architectures to validate that: a) DNT outperforms its\ncounterparts (\\ie, ViT and GPT), and b) DNT can be effectively trained with\nvanilla mSGDW.",

    "abstract": "As has been shown recently, the influence of the flexoelectric coupling\n(shortly \"flexocoupling\") on the fluctuations of electric polarization and\nelastic strains can lead to the principal changes of the dispersion law of soft\noptical and acoustic phonons (shortly \"flexophonons\") and ferrons (shortly\n\"flexoferrons\") in van der Waals ferrielectrics. Analytical results, derived in\nthe framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, revealed that the\ndispersion of flexophonons and flexoferrons is strongly anisotropic and should\ndepend on the magnitude and direction of applied electric field. In this work\nwe study the influence of applied electric field on the anisotropic dispersion\nof the flexophonons and flexophonons in a uniaxial van der Waals ferrielectric\nCuInP2S6. We reveal that the frequency of acoustic flexophonons and\nflexoferrons tends to zero at nonzero wavevectors under increase of applied\nelectric field. We relate the changes with a possible appearance of a spatially\nmodulated incommensurate polar phase induced by the flexocoupling in external\nfield. The critical strength of flexocoupling is determined by the magnitude of\nelectric field and direction of the wavevector. This allows us to propose a\nmethod for estimating the strength of flexocoupling in van der Waals\nferrielectrics, providing that the frequency of the acoustic flexophonon is\nzeroing at the threshold value of the electric field. Since the flexoelectric\ncoefficients are poorly known in van der Waals ferrielectrics, obtained\nanalytical results can be useful for their flexo-engineering.",

However, identifying TDEs in the vast alert streams produced by\nthese surveys requires automated and reliable classification pipelines that can\nselect promising candidates in real time. We developed a module within the Fink\nalert broker to identify TDEs during their rising phase. It was built to\nautonomously operate within the ZTF alert stream, producing a list of\ncandidates every night and enabling spectral and multi-wavelength follow-up\nnear peak brightness. All rising alerts are submitted to selection cuts and\nfeature extraction using the Rainbow multi-band lightcurve fit. Best-fit values\nwere used as input to train an XGBoost classifier with the goal of identifying\nTDEs. The training set was constructed using ZTF observations for objects with\navailable classification in the Transient Name Server. Finally, candidates with\nhigh enough probability were visually inspected. The classifier achieves 76%\nrecall, indicating strong performance in early-phase identification, despite\nthe limited available information before peak. We show that, out of the known\nTDEs that pass the selection cuts, half of them are flagged as TDE before\nhalfway in their rise, proving the feasibility of early classification.\nAdditionally, new candidates were identified by applying the classifier on\narchival data, including a likely repeated TDE and some potential TDEs\noccurring in active galaxies. The module is implemented into the Fink alert\nprocessing framework, reporting each night a small number of candidates to\ndedicated communication channels through a user-friendly interface, for manual\nvetting and potential follow-up.",

Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input\nembedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout\nthe document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The\nproposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and\nmulti-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,\nindependent of their positions within the document. The performance of the\nproposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction\ndatasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL.

The proposed research also has\ntheoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global\ncontext modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation\nextraction.

    "abstract": "In next-generation communications and networks, machine learning (ML) models\nare expected to deliver not only accurate predictions but also well-calibrated\nconfidence scores that reflect the true likelihood of correct decisions. This\npaper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor\nwithin a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish\nkey theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under\nperfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources\ngrows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected\noutput conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast,\nwhen only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall\nexpected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated\npredictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to\nachieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability\nrequirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot\nimprove the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new\ninformation about future channel states. Additionally, we show that\nwell-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that\nnecessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition\nthat the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to\noccur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous\nsimulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt\nscaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is\ntrained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system.\nFurthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with\ntemporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver\nmobility.",

The 5G-AKA protocol, standardized\nby 3GPP in TS 33.501, is central to authentication in current 5G deployments.\nIt provides mutual authentication, user privacy, and key secrecy. However,\ndespite its adoption, 5G-AKA has known limitations in both security and\nperformance. While it focuses on protecting privacy against passive attackers,\nrecent studies show its vulnerabilities to active attacks. It also relies on a\nsequence number mechanism to prevent replay attacks, requiring perfect\nsynchronization between the device and the core network. This stateful design\nadds complexity, causes desynchronization, and incurs extra communication\noverhead. More critically, 5G-AKA lacks Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), exposing\npast communications if long-term keys are compromised-an increasing concern\namid sophisticated threats. This paper proposes an enhanced authentication\nprotocol that builds on 5G-AKA's design while addressing its shortcomings.\nFirst, we introduce a stateless version that removes sequence number reliance,\nreducing complexity while staying compatible with existing SIM cards and\ninfrastructure. We then extend this design to add PFS with minimal\ncryptographic overhead. Both protocols are rigorously analyzed using ProVerif,\nconfirming their compliance with all major security requirements, including\nresistance to passive and active attacks, as well as those defined by 3GPP and\nacademic studies. We also prototype both protocols and evaluate their\nperformance against 5G-AKA and 5G-AKA' (USENIX'21).

While some progress has been made, existing methods continue\nto struggle with removing large-scale flare artifacts and repairing structural\ndamage in regions near the light source. We observe that these challenging\nflare artifacts exhibit more significant discrepancies from the reference\nimages in the frequency domain compared to the spatial domain. Therefore, this\npaper presents a novel dynamic frequency-guided deflare network (DFDNet) that\ndecouples content information from flare artifacts in the frequency domain,\neffectively removing large-scale flare artifacts. Specifically, DFDNet consists\nmainly of a global dynamic frequency-domain guidance (GDFG) module and a local\ndetail guidance module (LDGM). The GDFG module guides the network to perceive\nthe frequency characteristics of flare artifacts by dynamically optimizing\nglobal frequency domain features, effectively separating flare information from\ncontent information. Additionally, we design an LDGM via a contrastive learning\nstrategy that aligns the local features of the light source with the reference\nimage, reduces local detail damage from flare removal, and improves\nfine-grained image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of\nperformance.

The proposal is based on the concept of robust\npositively invariant sets and applies the extended Farkas' lemma to derive a\nset of algebraic conditions that define both the control gains and a robust\npositively invariant polyhedron that satisfies the control and state\nconstraints. These algebraic conditions are formulated into a bilinear\noptimization problem aimed at determining the output feedback gains and the\nassociated polyedral robust positively invariant region. The obtained\ncontroller ensures that any closed-loop trajectory originating from the\npolyhedron converges to another smaller inner polyhedral set around the origin\nin finite time, where the trajectory remains ultimately bounded regardless of\nthe persistent disturbances and variations in system parameters. Furthermore,\nby including the sizes of the two polyhedral sets inside the objective\nfunction, the proposed optimization can also jointly enlarge the outer set\nwhile minimizing the inner one.

    "abstract": "Ferrochiral materials with an achiral-to-chiral phase transition and\nswitchable chirality have unique application opportunities, enabling control of\nthe angular momentum of circularly polarized lattice vibrations (chiral\nphonons) and chirality-related electronic phenomena. Materials that fall into\nthis class are, however, extremely rare, and often accompanied by other types\nof ferroic order that interfere with the ferrochiral responses. In this work,\nwe demonstrate ferrochirality in two tetragonal tungsten bronzes, K4Bi2Nb10O30\nand Rb4Bi2Nb10O30. Using high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction combined with\ntransmission electron microscopy, we solve the incommensurately modulated and\nchiral structures. Temperature dependent X-ray powder diffraction reveals that\nboth materials undergo an achiral-to-chiral phase transition from P4/mbm to\nP4212(00{\\gamma})q00. The chirality originates from a cooperative helical\ndisplacement of Bi3+ atoms perpendicular to the c direction and represents the\nprimary order parameter. As a secondary effect of the ferrochiral order, a\nspatially varying piezoelectric response is observed, consistent with the\npolycrystalline nature of the investigated materials. Through invariant\nanalysis, an external electric-strain-field coupling with the piezoelectricity\nis proposed as a conjugate field for switching chirality, establishing\ntetragonal tungsten bronzes as a versatile playground for the emergent field of\nferrochirality.",

Despite this progress, the formidable cost of fabricating\nlarge-scale quantum processors means they will remain rare for the foreseeable\nfuture, limiting their widespread application. To address this bottleneck, we\nintroduce the concept of predictive surrogates, which are classical learning\nmodels designed to emulate the mean-value behavior of a given quantum processor\nwith provably computational efficiency. In particular, we propose two\npredictive surrogates that can substantially reduce the need for quantum\nprocessor access in diverse practical scenarios. To demonstrate their potential\nin advancing digital quantum simulation, we use these surrogates to emulate a\nquantum processor with up to 20 programmable superconducting qubits, enabling\nefficient pre-training of variational quantum eigensolvers for families of\ntransverse-field Ising models and identification of non-equilibrium Floquet\nsymmetry-protected topological phases. Experimental results reveal that the\npredictive surrogates not only reduce measurement overhead by orders of\nmagnitude, but can also surpass the performance of conventional,\nquantum-resource-intensive approaches. Collectively, these findings establish\npredictive surrogates as a practical pathway to broadening the impact of\nadvanced quantum processors.",

We conduct a\nseries of experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings,\nexploring how factors such as prompt design, the number and order of in-context\nexamples and access to visual information might affect VE performance. To\nfurther probe the reasoning processes of the model, we used explanation-based\nevaluations. Results indicate that three-shot inference outperforms the\nzero-shot baselines. However, additional examples introduce more noise than\nthey provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a\ncritical factor that influences the predictions. In the absence of visual\ninformation, the model has a strong tendency to hallucinate and imagine\ncontent, raising questions about the model's over-reliance on linguistic\npriors.

    "abstract": "Interior to the orbits of Jupiter's iconic Galilean moons are four small\nsatellites with individual mean radii, $R\\lesssim 84$ km. Multiple lines of\nevidence suggest that these bodies formed at a more distant location in\nJupiter's circumplanetary disk before coming to reside at their current\nshort-period orbits. Nonetheless, how these moons dynamically evolved to such a\nlocation has yet to be explained in the emerging paradigm of Jovian satellite\nformation. Here, we present a quantitative model for the origin of the largest\nof these inner moons, Amalthea, that can be extended to its neighbor, Thebe,\nand to other small bodies in astrophysical disks. We propose that Amalthea's\nanomalous features are due to it having formed alongside the Galileans in a\nreservoir of satellitesimals located at a large jovian-centric distance. As the\ninnermost Galilean, Io, migrated inward from this reservoir, it captured the\nsatellitesimal, Amalthea, into resonance and shepherded the small body to its\nmodern neighborhood. During migration through the disk, dissipative forcing\nfrom aerodynamic drag induces overstable librations in the Io-Amalthea\nresonance, such that only a narrow range of nebular parameters can accommodate\nthe requisite long-range transport. In particular, the disk-aspect ratio,\n$h/r$, emerges as the key variable. Our calculations indicate that the\ncircumjovian disk had a scale height of at least $h/r\\gtrsim0.08$, implying a\nrelatively hot, actively accreting disk during the epoch of satellite\nformation. These results thus shed light on the evolution of the Jovian system,\nalong with the more general phenomenon of satellite-disk interactions.",

The sensors are modeled as\nspin systems governed by a transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian in thermal\nequilibrium at low temperatures. Using a genetic algorithm (GA), we evolve\nnetwork topologies to maximize a perturbative spectral sensitivity measure,\nwhich serves as the fitness function for the GA. For the best-performing\ngraphs, we compute the corresponding quantum Fisher information (QFI) to assess\nthe ultimate bounds on estimation precision. To enable efficient scaling, we\nuse the GA-generated data to train a deep neural network, allowing\nextrapolation to larger graph sizes where direct computation becomes\nprohibitive. Our results show that while both the fitness function and QFI\ninitially increase with system size, the QFI exhibits a clear non-monotonic\nbehavior - saturating and eventually declining beyond a critical graph size.\nThis reflects the loss of superlinear scaling of the QFI, as the narrowing of\nthe energy gap signals a crossover to classical scaling of the QFI with system\nsize. The effect is reminiscent of the microeconomic law of diminishing\nreturns: beyond an optimal graph size, further increases yield reduced sensing\nperformance. This saturation and decline in precision are particularly\npronounced under Kac scaling, where both the QFI and spin squeezing plateau or\ndegrade with increasing system size. We also attribute observed even-odd\noscillations in the spectral sensitivity and QFI to quantum interference\neffects in spin phase space, as confirmed by our phase-space analysis. These\nfindings highlight the critical role of optimizing interaction topology -\nrather than simply increasing network size - and demonstrate the potential of\nhybrid evolutionary and learning-based approaches for designing\nhigh-performance quantum sensors.",

Traditional retrieval-based methods for\ngeo-localization struggle with scalability and perceptual aliasing, while\nclassification-based approaches lack generalization and require extensive\ntraining data. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer a\npromising alternative by leveraging contextual understanding and reasoning.\nHowever, while VLMs achieve high accuracy, they are often prone to\nhallucinations and lack interpretability, making them unreliable as standalone\nsolutions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid geo-localization framework\nthat combines the strengths of VLMs with retrieval-based visual place\nrecognition (VPR) methods.

Existing approaches typically adopt either\nchannel-mixing (CM) or channel-independence (CI) strategies.

CI strategy improves this aspect but fails to fully exploit\ncross-variable dependencies like CM. Hybrid strategies based on feature fusion\noffer limited generalization and interpretability.

Extensive experiments on seven models show that C3RL\nboosts the best-case performance rate to 81.4\\% for models based on CI strategy\nand to 76.3\\% for models based on CM strategy, demonstrating strong\ngeneralization and effectiveness.

As the state-of-the-art, branch and bound (BaB) is\na \"divide-and-conquer\" strategy that applies off-the-shelf verifiers to\nsub-problems for which they perform better. While BaB can identify the\nsub-problems that are necessary to be split, it explores the space of these\nsub-problems in a naive \"first-come-first-serve\" manner, thereby suffering from\nan issue of inefficiency to reach a verification conclusion. To bridge this\ngap, we introduce an order over different sub-problems produced by BaB,\nconcerning with their different likelihoods of containing counterexamples.\nBased on this order, we propose a novel verification framework Oliva that\nexplores the sub-problem space by prioritizing those sub-problems that are more\nlikely to find counterexamples, in order to efficiently reach the conclusion of\nthe verification. Even if no counterexample can be found in any sub-problem, it\nonly changes the order of visiting different sub-problem and so will not lead\nto a performance degradation. Specifically, Oliva has two variants, including\n$Oliva^{GR}$, a greedy strategy that always prioritizes the sub-problems that\nare more likely to find counterexamples, and $Oliva^{SA}$, a balanced strategy\ninspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to\nexploitation to locate the globally optimal sub-problems. We experimentally\nevaluate the performance of Oliva on 690 verification problems spanning over 5\nmodels with datasets MNIST and CIFAR10.

    "abstract": "We establish an approach to analyze the free hadron and transition\n(nonperturbative) regions of near-side energy-energy correlators (EECs) based\non dihadron fragmentation functions (DiFFs). We introduce a (nonperturbative)\nfunction we call the \"EEC-DiFF\" and explicitly show that expanding it for large\nrelative transverse momentum between the two hadrons gives the $O(\\alpha_s)$\nexpression for the \"EEC jet\" function used in the quark/gluon (perturbative)\nregion. This connection indicates that a formal theoretical matching will be\nable to bridge the free hadron, transition, and quark/gluon regions and allow\nall of them to be analyzed simultaneously. We further derive a result valid for\nnear-side EECs in the free hadron and transition regions of $e^+e^-$\nannihilation in terms of the EEC-DiFF. Using a simple model for the function,\nwe perform the first fit to experimental data in this regime. We find\nreasonable agreement with the measurements and reproduce the salient features\nof near-side EECs in the free hadron and transition regions.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive link sizes is a major breakthrough step in evolving networks and is\nnow considered as an essential process both in biological and artificial neural\nnetworks. In adaptive networks the link weights change in time and, in brain\ndynamics, these changes are controlled by the potential variations of the pre-\nand post-synaptic neurons. In particular, in biological neural networks the\nadaptivity of the links (synapses) was first addressed by D. Hebb who proposed\nthe rule that neurons which fire together wire together. In the present study,\nwe explore the effects of adaptive linking in networks where hybrid\nsynchronization patterns (solitaries, chimeras and bump states) are observed in\nthe absence of adaptivity (i.e., for constant coupling strengths). The network\nconsists of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons coupled nonlocally in a 1D\nring geometry. The adaptivity follows the Hebbian principle adjusted by the Oja\nrule to avoid unbounded increase of the coupling strengths. Our results\nindicate that, for negative coupling strengths, the adaptive LIF network may\ntransit through chimera state regimes with different multiplicity, provided\nthat the time scales governing the link dynamics are relatively small compared\nto the time scales of the potential evolution. Moreover, the size of the\ncoherent and incoherent domains of the chimera and their multiplicity change\nfollowing the average coupling strength in the network. Similar results are\nshown for the case of bump states: for positive coupling strengths, the\nadaptive LIF network transits through states of different number of active and\nsubthreshold domains. The size and number of these domains also follow the\nevolution of the average coupling strength. Such transient effects are\nsuppressed when the time scales governing the link adaptive dynamics become of\nthe same order as the time scales governing the potential dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various\nfields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or\nadding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered\nwide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an\ninference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort\nfor parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model\narchitecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different\nbenefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity\ncalculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To\naddress this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by\ncombining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding\nRAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects\nretrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity;\nhowever, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG\ngenerates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then\nselects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average\nimprovements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG,\nrespectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models\nindicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various\ndomains.

A maximum a posteriori ratio test (MAPRT) detector is applied\nunder two awareness levels at RX-APs. To balance the communication-sensing\ntrade-off, we develop a power allocation algorithm to jointly maximize the\nminimum detection probability and communication\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while satisfying power\nconstraints. The proposed scheme outperforms non-weighted methods. Adding test\nstatistics from more RX-APs can degrade sensing performance due to weaker\nchannels, but this effect can be mitigated by optimizing the weighting\nexponent.

Using 3D confocal\nreconstructions, we extract vesicle shape, curvature, wrapping fraction, and\nthe bendo-capillary length, a characteristic length scale that balances\nmembrane bending and adhesion forces. We find that when vesicle size exceeds\nthis length scale, engulfment is primarily governed by geometry.

In this\npaper, we use the HELAS package to numerically study gauge symmetry in EW\namplitudes. First, we directly test gauge symmetry by examining the MWI of\namplitudes. Second, we modify the couplings within a vertex and of vertices to\ncheck if and how the MWI changes. Third, we test gauge symmetry by considering\nthe couplings modified by operators from the standard model effective field\ntheory (SMEFT). Similar to the standard model, there are relations between\ndifferent couplings that are protected by gauge symmetry. We find that if we\nmodify the couplings to deviate from the relations, the MWI is violated. On the\nother hand, the MWI is restored when the relations between couplings reduce to\nthose in the SMEFT.",

In addition, the relax\nparameter is determined by requiring energy and/or enstrophy conservation,\nwhich enforces stability of the method and reduces the appearance of numerical\nwiggles, especially when the filter is built in scarce data regimes.

We measured the\n$\\mathit{\\Gamma_{*,10}} - M_{*,10}$ relation and its evolution over the\nredshift range $0.17\\leq z \\leq 0.37$. We then built a toy model for the merger\nevolution of galaxies, based on N-body simulations, to explore to what extent\nthe observed growth in $\\mathit{\\Gamma_{*,10}} - M_{*,10}$ relation is\nconsistent with a dry-merger evolution scenario.\n  Results: From the observations, we do not detect evidence for an evolution of\nthe $\\mathit{\\Gamma_{*,10}} - M_{*,10}$ relation. We put an upper limit on the\nredshift derivative of the normalization$~(\\mu)$ and slope$~(\\beta)$of the\n$\\mathit{\\Gamma_{*,10}} - M_{*,10}$ relation $|\\partial \\mu/\\partial \\log\n(1+z)| \\leq 0.13$ and $\\left|\\partial \\beta/\\partial \\log (1+z)\\right| \\leq\n1.10$, respectively. Simulations show that most mergers induce a decrease in\n$\\mathit{\\Gamma_{*,10}}$ and an increase in $M_{*,10}$, although some show a\ndecrease in $M_{*,10}$, particularly for the most extended galaxies and smaller\nmerger mass ratios. By combining the observations with our merger toy model, we\nplaced an upper limit on $f_M = 11.2 \\%$ in the redshift range $0.17 \\leq z\n\\leq 0.37$.\n  Conclusions: While our measurement is limited by systematics, the application\nof our approach to samples with a larger redshift baseline, particularly with a\ntime interval $\\Delta t \\geq 3.2~\\mathrm{Gyr}$, should enable us to detect a\nsignal and help us better understand the late growth of ETGs.",

The core features\nof this new custody transfer method for BPv7 are: (1) A strategy to efficiently\nidentify sets of bundles by sequence numbering (2) A new Custody Transfer\nExtension Block and a corresponding administrative record, Compressed Custody\nSignal, to efficiently report on the acceptance or rejection of custody using\nsequence numbering (3) A new Compressed Reporting Extension Block requesting\nreporting on bundle processing steps using a corresponding administrative\nrecord with sequence numbering for efficiency. The paper will describe those\nconcepts and their design, specification, and implementation in detail.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nlanguage-based, netlist-aware neural network designed explicitly for standard\ncells. Our approach employs two pre-trained neural models of waveform\nprediction and delay estimation that directly infer transient waveforms and\npropagation delays from SPICE netlists, conditioned on critical physical\nparameters such as load capacitance, input slew, and gate size. This method\naccurately captures both intrinsic and coupling-induced delay effects without\nrequiring simplification or interpolation. For multi-stage timing prediction,\nwe implement a recursive propagation strategy where predicted waveforms from\neach stage feed into subsequent stages, cumulatively capturing delays across\nthe logic chain. This approach ensures precise timing alignment and complete\nwaveform visibility throughout complex signal pathways. The waveform prediction\nutilizes a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with netlist-aware node-level\nencoding, addressing traditional Transformers' fixed input dimensionality\nconstraints. Additionally, specialized subnetworks separately handle primary\ndelay estimation and crosstalk correction. Experimental results demonstrate\nSPICE-level accuracy, consistently achieving RMSE below 0.0098 across diverse\nindustrial circuits.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in code large language models (CodeLLMs) have made them\nindispensable tools in modern software engineering. However, these models\noccasionally produce outputs that contain proprietary or sensitive code\nsnippets, raising concerns about potential non-compliant use of training data,\nand posing risks to privacy and intellectual property. To ensure responsible\nand compliant deployment of CodeLLMs, training data detection (TDD) has become\na critical task. While recent TDD methods have shown promise in natural\nlanguage settings, their effectiveness on code data remains largely\nunderexplored. This gap is particularly important given code's structured\nsyntax and distinct similarity criteria compared to natural language. To\naddress this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of seven\nstate-of-the-art TDD methods on source code data, evaluating their performance\nacross eight CodeLLMs. To support this evaluation, we introduce CodeSnitch, a\nfunction-level benchmark dataset comprising 9,000 code samples in three\nprogramming languages, each explicitly labeled as either included or excluded\nfrom CodeLLM training. Beyond evaluation on the original CodeSnitch, we design\ntargeted mutation strategies to test the robustness of TDD methods under three\ndistinct settings. These mutation strategies are grounded in the\nwell-established Type-1 to Type-4 code clone detection taxonomy. Our study\nprovides a systematic assessment of current TDD techniques for code and offers\ninsights to guide the development of more effective and robust detection\nmethods in the future.",

In\nthe line of research implied by the former possibility, in this work we shall\nexamine the implied neutron star phenomenology from vector $f(R)$ gravity\ninflationary models. These theories are basically scalar-tensor deformations of\nthe Starobinsky inflationary model. We shall present the essential features of\ncosmologically viable and non-viable deformations of the Starobinsky model,\noriginating from vector $f(R)$ gravity inflationary theories, and we indicate\nwhich models and for which equations of state provide a viable neutron star\nphenomenology. We solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations using a robust\ndouble shooting LSODA python based code, for the following piecewise polytropic\nequations of state the WFF1, the SLy, the APR, the MS1, the AP3, the AP4, the\nENG, the MPA1 and the MS1b. We confront the resulting phenomenology with\nseveral well known neutron star constraints and we indicate which equation of\nstate and model fits the phenomenological constraints. A remarkable feature,\nalso known from other inflationary attractor models, is that the MPA1 is the\nequation of state which is most nicely fitted the constraints, for all the\ntheoretical models used, and actually the maximum mass for this equation of\nstate is well inside the mass-gap region. Another mentionable feature that\nstroked us with surprise is the fact that even cosmologically non-viable\ninflationary models produced a viable neutron star phenomenology, which most\nlikely has to be a model-dependent feature.",

To follow the flux evolution\nduring the outburst we monitored the source for about three months with the\nFollow-up X-ray Telescope of EP. The XMM-Newton observation was performed on\n2024 September 15 and we used the data from the European Photon Imaging Camera\n(EPIC) for detailed spectral and timing analyses. The EPIC X-ray spectrum is\nwell described by an absorbed power law with photon index of 1.25 +/- 0.04 and\nthe timing analysis revealed pulsations with 146.79 +\\- 0.03 s. The source flux\nhad decreased by a factor of about 10 since the observed maximum about one\nmonth before the XMM-Newton observation. EP J005146.9-730930 was never detected\nsignificantly during serendipitous observations before September 2024. The\ncharacteristics of the X-ray brightening suggest the source was discovered\nduring a type II outburst reaching an X-ray peak luminosity of ~2 x 10^37\nerg/s. The trend of spectral hardening towards higher luminosities observed by\nEP suggests that the source is accreting below the critical luminosity,\nyielding an estimated lower limit for the pulsar magnetic field strength of 3.3\nx 10^12 G. The improved X-ray position confirms the candidate Be star OGLE\nJ005147.58-730924.7 as optical counterpart.

Traditional approaches primarily focus on disentangling\nattributes and objects, treating them as independent entities during learning.\nHowever, this assumption overlooks the semantic constraints and contextual\ndependencies inside a composition. For example, certain attributes naturally\npair with specific objects (e.g., \"striped\" applies to \"zebra\" or \"shirts\" but\nnot \"sky\" or \"water\"), while the same attribute can manifest differently\ndepending on context (e.g., \"young\" in \"young tree\" vs. \"young dog\"). Thus,\ncapturing attribute-object interdependence remains a fundamental yet\nlong-ignored challenge in CZSL. In this paper, we adopt a Conditional\nProbability Framework (CPF) to explicitly model attribute-object dependencies.\nWe decompose the probability of a composition into two components: the\nlikelihood of an object and the conditional likelihood of its attribute. To\nenhance object feature learning, we incorporate textual descriptors to\nhighlight semantically relevant image regions. These enhanced object features\nthen guide attribute learning through a cross-attention mechanism, ensuring\nbetter contextual alignment. By jointly optimizing object likelihood and\nconditional attribute likelihood, our method effectively captures compositional\ndependencies and generalizes well to unseen compositions.

The presence of asymptotic states ensures gauge invariance of the\ntheory, but, in the case of gravity, the states exist only in asymptotically\nflat spacetimes, that limits possible topologies. Then we have two ways. The\nfirst way is to consider only asymptotically flat spacetimes. In fact, it\nreduces quantum gravity to quantum field theory on a given background. The\nsecond way is to reject the assumption about asymptotic states. In the case of\nnon-trivial topology, one cannot cover the whole spacetime with the only\ncoordinate system. One has to introduce various reference frames fixed by\ndifferent gauge conditions in different spacetime regions. The Hamiltonian\ndescribing a gravitating system will depend on gauge conditions. It leads to\nthe conclusion that unitary evolution may be broken down. This conclusion\ncannot be obtained in approaches based on the Wheeler - DeWitt equation or\nmaking use of the assumption about asymptotic states. The assessment of this\nconclusion is given.",

In Java, tools such as JApiCmp and Revapi are commonly used\nto detect BCs between library releases, but their reliance on binary JARs\nlimits their applicability. This restriction hinders large-scale longitudinal\nstudies of API evolution and fine-grained analyses such as commit-level BC\ndetection. In this paper, we introduce Roseau, a novel static analysis tool\nthat constructs technology-agnostic API models from library code equipped with\nrich semantic analyses. API models can be analyzed to study API evolution and\ncompared to identify BCs between any two versions of a library (releases,\ncommits, branches, etc.). Unlike traditional approaches, Roseau can build API\nmodels from source code or bytecode, and is optimized for large-scale\nlongitudinal analyses of library histories. We assess the accuracy,\nperformance, and suitability of Roseau for longitudinal studies of API\nevolution, using JApiCmp and Revapi as baselines. We extend and refine an\nestablished benchmark of BCs and show that Roseau achieves higher accuracy (F1\n= 0.99) than JApiCmp (F1 = 0.86) and Revapi (F1 = 0.91). We analyze 60 popular\nlibraries from Maven Central and find that Roseau delivers excellent\nperformance, detecting BCs between versions in under two seconds, including in\nlibraries with hundreds of thousands of lines of code. We further illustrate\nthe limitations of JApiCmp and Revapi for longitudinal studies and the novel\nanalysis capabilities offered by Roseau by tracking the evolution of Google's\nGuava API and the introduction of BCs over 14 years and 6,839 commits, reducing\nanalysis times from a few days to a few minutes.",

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance\nmitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method\nthat adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each\ninstance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two\ntasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a\ndynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of\n81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based\nadaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of\n87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off\nrelative to our original early-stopping method.",

    "abstract": "An ordinal classification (OC) problem corresponds to a special type of\nclassification characterised by the presence of a natural order relationship\namong the classes. This type of problem can be found in a number of real-world\napplications, motivating the design and development of many ordinal\nmethodologies over the last years. However, it is important to highlight that\nthe development of the OC field suffers from one main disadvantage: the lack of\na comprehensive set of datasets on which novel approaches to the literature\nhave to be benchmarked. In order to approach this objective, this manuscript\nfrom the University of C\\'ordoba (UCO), which have previous experience on the\nOC field, provides the literature with a publicly available repository of\ntabular data for a robust validation of novel OC approaches, namely TOC-UCO\n(Tabular Ordinal Classification repository of the UCO). Specifically, this\nrepository includes a set of $46$ tabular ordinal datasets, preprocessed under\na common framework and ensured to have a reasonable number of patterns and an\nappropriate class distribution. We also provide the sources and preprocessing\nsteps of each dataset, along with details on how to benchmark a novel approach\nusing the TOC-UCO repository.

    "abstract": "In the field of food image processing, efficient semantic segmentation\ntechniques are crucial for industrial applications. However, existing\nlarge-scale Transformer-based models (such as FoodSAM) face challenges in\nmeeting practical deploymentrequirements due to their massive parameter counts\nand high computational resource demands. This paper introduces TUNable Adapter\nmodule (Swin-TUNA), a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that\nintegrates multiscale trainable adapters into the Swin Transformer\narchitecture, achieving high-performance food image segmentation by updating\nonly 4% of the parameters. The core innovation of Swin-TUNA lies in its\nhierarchical feature adaptation mechanism: it designs separable convolutions in\ndepth and dimensional mappings of varying scales to address the differences in\nfeatures between shallow and deep networks, combined with a dynamic balancing\nstrategy for tasks-agnostic and task-specific features. Experiments demonstrate\nthat this method achieves mIoU of 50.56% and 74.94% on the FoodSeg103 and\nUECFoodPix Complete datasets, respectively, surpassing the fully parameterized\nFoodSAM model while reducing the parameter count by 98.7% (to only 8.13M).\nFurthermore, Swin-TUNA exhibits faster convergence and stronger generalization\ncapabilities in low-data scenarios, providing an efficient solution for\nassembling lightweight food image.",

    "abstract": "Distributed machine learning in high end-to-end latency and low, varying\nbandwidth network environments undergoes severe throughput degradation. Due to\nits low communication requirements, distributed SGD (D-SGD) remains the\nmainstream optimizer in such challenging networks, but it still suffers from\nsignificant throughput reduction. To mitigate these limitations, existing\napproaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to\nalleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both\nchallenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a\ncomplex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed\nsynchronization steps), and model convergence rate. To achieve the balance\nunder varying bandwidth conditions, an adaptive policy is required to\ndynamically adjust these parameters. Unfortunately, existing works rely on\nstatic heuristic strategies due to the lack of theoretical guidance, which\nprevents them from achieving this goal. This study fills in this theoretical\ngap by introducing a new theoretical tool, decomposing the joint optimization\nproblem into a traditional convergence rate analysis with multiple analyzable\nnoise terms. We are the first to reveal that staleness exponentially amplifies\nthe negative impact of gradient compression on training performance, filling a\ncritical gap in understanding how compressed and delayed gradients affect\ntraining. Furthermore, by integrating the convergence rate with a network-aware\ntime minimization condition, we propose DeCo-SGD, which dynamically adjusts the\ncompression ratio and staleness based on the real-time network condition and\ntraining task. DeCo-SGD achieves up to 5.07 and 1.37 speed-ups over D-SGD and\nstatic strategy in high-latency and low, varying bandwidth networks,\nrespectively.",

Here, we employ density functional theory\n(DFT)-based electronic structure calculations to elucidate the molecular\nmechanisms and energetics of BD-mediated crosslinking across PE, PP, and PS.

Moreover, BD exhibits\nselective reactivity towards the tertiary and secondary C-H bonds in PP and PS,\nrespectively. Comparative analysis shows that BD dramatically outperforms DVB,\nespecially in saturated polymers, enabling reaction times that are orders of\nmagnitude faster.

Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive\nlearning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment\nacross all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous\nalignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as\nlimitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from\noptimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this\npaper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel\nframework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without\nanchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the\ntheoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix,\nPMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to\nalign modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based\nloss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest\nsingular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the\nleading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents\nrepresentation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate\nPMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods. The source code will be\npublicly available.",

While this paradigm can produce diverse motion intentions, it\noften falls short in modeling the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of\ntrajectories, which can lead to collisions or suboptimal outcomes. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose DeMo++, a framework that decouples motion\nestimation into two distinct components: holistic motion intentions to capture\nthe diverse potential directions of movement, and fine spatiotemporal states to\ntrack the agent's dynamic progress within the scene and enable a\nself-refinement capability. Further, we introduce a cross-scene trajectory\ninteraction mechanism to explore the relationships between motions in adjacent\nscenes. This allows DeMo++ to comprehensively model both the diversity of\nmotion intentions and the spatiotemporal evolution of each trajectory. To\neffectively implement this framework, we developed a hybrid model combining\nAttention and Mamba.

    "abstract": "License plate recognition in open environments is widely applicable across\nvarious domains; however, the diversity of license plate types and imaging\nconditions presents significant challenges. To address the limitations\nencountered by CNN and CRNN-based approaches in license plate recognition, this\npaper proposes a unified solution that integrates a lightweight visual encoder\nwith a text decoder, within a pre-training framework tailored for single and\ndouble-line Chinese license plates. To mitigate the scarcity of double-line\nlicense plate datasets, we constructed a single/double-line license plate\ndataset by synthesizing images, applying texture mapping onto real scenes, and\nblending them with authentic license plate images. Furthermore, to enhance the\nsystem's recognition accuracy, we introduce a perspective correction network\n(PTN) that employs license plate corner coordinate regression as an implicit\nvariable, supervised by license plate view classification information. This\nnetwork offers improved stability, interpretability, and low annotation costs.\nThe proposed algorithm achieves an average recognition accuracy of 99.34% on\nthe corrected CCPD test set under coarse localization disturbance. When\nevaluated under fine localization disturbance, the accuracy further improves to\n99.58%. On the double-line license plate test set, it achieves an average\nrecognition accuracy of 98.70%, with processing speeds reaching up to 167\nframes per second, indicating strong practical applicability.",

    "abstract": "In low-altitude surveillance and early warning systems, detecting weak moving\ntargets remains a significant challenge due to low signal energy, small spatial\nextent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with\nextracting robust features and suffer from the lack of reliable annotations. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS)\nframework that enables high-performance detection of weak targets without any\nmanual annotations.Instead of conventional frame-based detection, our framework\nreformulates the task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem, where\nweak targets manifest as short-duration pulse-like responses. A Temporal Signal\nReconstruction Network (TSRNet) is developed under the TPS paradigm to\nreconstruct these transient signals.TSRNet adopts an encoder-decoder\narchitecture and integrates a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention)\nmodule to enhance its sensitivity to diverse temporal patterns. Additionally, a\ngraph-based trajectory mining strategy is employed to suppress false alarms and\nensure temporal consistency.Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR\ndataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nwhile requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance\nand operates at over 1000 FPS, underscoring its potential for real-time\ndeployment in practical scenarios.",

Each human part, such\nas a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into\nothers. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to\ninfer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most\nexisting 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part\nsegmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions.\nIn this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a\nkey guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core\ncomponents. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we\npropose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially\nreconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based\non the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into\ntexture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module\n(PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image\ngeneration network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human\nreconstruction. The project page is available at\nhttps://hygenie1228.github.io/PARTE/.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in mechanical, aerospace, and structural engineering have\ndriven a growing need for efficient ways to model and analyse structures at\nmuch larger and more complex scales than before. While established numerical\nmethods like the Finite Element Method remain reliable, they often struggle\nwith computational cost and scalability when dealing with large and\ngeometrically intricate problems. In recent years, neural network-based methods\nhave shown promise because of their ability to efficiently approximate\nnonlinear mappings. However, most existing neural approaches are still largely\nlimited to simple domains, which makes it difficult to apply to real-world PDEs\ninvolving complex geometries. In this paper, we propose a learning-based domain\ndecomposition method (L-DDM) that addresses this gap. Our approach uses a\nsingle, pre-trained neural operator-originally trained on simple domains-as a\nsurrogate model within a domain decomposition scheme, allowing us to tackle\nlarge and complicated domains efficiently. We provide a general theoretical\nresult on the existence of neural operator approximations in the context of\ndomain decomposition solution of abstract PDEs. We then demonstrate our method\nby accurately approximating solutions to elliptic PDEs with discontinuous\nmicrostructures in complex geometries, using a physics-pretrained neural\noperator (PPNO). Our results show that this approach not only outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods on these challenging problems, but also offers\nresolution-invariance and strong generalization to microstructural patterns\nunseen during training.",

By discretizing this representation through a hashing layer,\nEndoFinder enables real-time retrieval from a compiled database of historical\npolyp cases, where diagnostic information serves as interpretable references\nfor new queries. We evaluate EndoFinder on both public and newly collected\npolyp datasets for re-identification and pathology classification.

Finally, we illustrate this framework by proving that the\npolynomial model structure of Weiss calculus is a particular instance of tested\nBousfield-Friedlander localization.",

This research explores the\nconnection between CT proficiency and design-level code smells--issues that may\nhinder software maintenance and evolution--in programs created by Scratch\ndevelopers. We seek to identify which CT dimensions align most strongly with\nwhich code smells and whether task context moderates those associations.\nMethod.

Specifically, the matching stage is decomposed into two\nprogressive phases, bridged by a region-based selective cross-attention\nmechanism designed to enhance feature discriminability.

While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead\ndue to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.\nExisting acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early\nstopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via\nspeculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers\nfrom limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,\nand fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing\nconcise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a\ntoken-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT\ninference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large\nlanguage model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to\ngenerate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's\nconfidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback\nand selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency\nand answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible\nwith standard decoding pipelines.

A comprehensive statistical\ninvestigation carried out on the ADITYA-U tokamak has led to the observation\nand characterization of a novel disruption regime. In contrast to the\nconventional Locked Mode Disruption (LMD), the newly identified disruption\nexhibits a distinctive two-phase evolution: an initial phase characterized by a\nsteady rise in mode frequency with a nonlinearly saturated amplitude, followed\nby a sudden frequency collapse accompanied by a pronounced increase in\namplitude. This behaviour signifies the onset of the precursor phase on a\nsignificantly shorter timescale. Clear empirical thresholds have been\nidentified to distinguish this disruption type from conventional LMD events,\nincluding edge safety factor, current decay coefficient, current quench (CQ)\ntime, and CQ rate. The newly identified disruption regime is predominantly\ngoverned by the (m/n = 2/1) drift-tearing mode (DTM), which, in contrast to\ntypical disruptions in the ADITYA-U tokamak that involve both m/n = 2/1 and 3/1\nmodes, consistently manifests as the sole dominant instability. Initiated by\ncore temperature hollowing, the growth of this mode is significantly enhanced\nby a synergistic interplay between a strongly localized pressure gradient and\nthe pronounced steepening of the current density profile in the vicinity of the\nmode rational surface.",

    "abstract": "The solar wind, accelerated within the solar corona, sculpts the heliosphere\nand continuously interacts with planetary atmospheres. On Earth, high-speed\nsolar-wind streams may lead to severe disruption of satellite operations and\npower grids. Accurate and reliable forecasting of the ambient solar-wind speed\nis therefore highly desirable. This work presents an encoder-decoder\nneural-network framework for simultaneously forecasting the daily averaged\nsolar-wind speed for the subsequent four days. The encoder-decoder framework is\ntrained with the two different modes of solar observations. The history of\nsolar-wind observations from prior solar-rotations and EUV coronal observations\nup to four days prior to the current time form the input to two different\nencoders. The decoder is designed to output the daily averaged solar-wind speed\nfrom four days prior to the current time to four days into the future. Our\nmodel outputs the solar-wind speed with Root-Mean-Square Errors (RMSEs) of 55\nkm/s, 58 km/s, 58 km/s, and 58 km/s and Pearson correlations of 0.78, 0.66,\n0.64 and 0.63 for one to four days in advance respectively. While the model is\ntrained and validated on observations between 2010 - 2018, we demonstrate its\nrobustness via application on unseen test data between 2019 - 2023, yielding\nRMSEs of 53 km/s and Pearson correlations 0.55 for a four-day advance\nprediction. Our encoder-decoder model thus produces much improved RMSE values\ncompared to the previous works and paves the way for developing comprehensive\nmultimodal deep learning models for operational solar wind forecasting.",

Current algorithmic\napproaches predominantly rely on proxy metrics for indirect assessment, often\nfailing to align with real user perceptions, thus creating a gap. With large\nlanguage models (LLMs) increasingly revolutionizing evaluation methodologies\nacross various human annotation tasks, we are inspired to explore a core\nresearch proposition: Can LLMs effectively simulate human users for serendipity\nevaluation? To address this question, we conduct a meta-evaluation on two\ndatasets derived from real user studies in the e-commerce and movie domains,\nfocusing on three key aspects: the accuracy of LLMs compared to conventional\nproxy metrics, the influence of auxiliary data on LLM comprehension, and the\nefficacy of recently popular multi-LLM techniques. Our findings indicate that\neven the simplest zero-shot LLMs achieve parity with, or surpass, the\nperformance of conventional metrics. Furthermore, multi-LLM techniques and the\nincorporation of auxiliary data further enhance alignment with human\nperspectives. Based on our findings, the optimal evaluation by LLMs yields a\nPearson correlation coefficient of 21.5\\% when compared to the results of the\nuser study.

    "abstract": "State estimation from noisy observations is a fundamental problem in many\napplications of signal processing. Traditional methods, such as the extended\nKalman filter, work well under fully-known Gaussian models, while recent hybrid\ndeep learning frameworks, combining model-based and data-driven approaches, can\nalso handle partially known models and non-Gaussian noise. However, existing\nstudies commonly assume the absence of quantization distortion, which is\ninevitable, especially with non-ideal analog-to-digital converters. In this\nwork, we consider a state estimation problem with 1-bit quantization. 1-bit\nquantization causes significant quantization distortion and severe information\nloss, rendering conventional state estimation strategies unsuitable. To address\nthis, inspired by the Bussgang decomposition technique, we first develop the\nBussgang-aided Kalman filter by assuming perfectly known models. The proposed\nmethod suitably captures quantization distortion into the state estimation\nprocess. In addition, we propose a computationally efficient variant, referred\nto as the reduced Bussgang-aided Kalman filter and, building upon it, introduce\na deep learning-based approach for handling partially known models, termed the\nBussgang-aided KalmanNet. In particular, the Bussgang-aided KalmanNet jointly\nuses a dithering technique and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) architecture to\neffectively mitigate the effects of 1-bit quantization and model mismatch.\nThrough simulations on the Lorenz-Attractor model and the Michigan NCLT\ndataset, we demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve accurate state\nestimation performance even under highly nonlinear, mismatched models and 1-bit\nobservations.",

    "abstract": "Although SAM-based single-source domain generalization models for medical\nimage segmentation can mitigate the impact of domain shift on the model in\ncross-domain scenarios, these models still face two major challenges. First,\nthe segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated\nprompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image\nsegmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second,\nproviding poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large)\nto the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask\nresults. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain\ngeneralization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully\nautomated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted\nGeneration Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty\nModeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module\nintegrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty\ndistribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding\nbox prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with\nSAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image\nembeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the\ntarget object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts. Extensive\nexperiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate\nthe effectiveness of FA-SAM and highlight its potential to address the above\nchallenges.",

Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other\nfields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In\naddition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism\nand computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly\nrecognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about\nhow these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to\nclosing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of\nML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly\nall articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key\ndimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the\ndataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available.

    "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a pivotal solution to reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions paving a pathway to net zero. As the adoption of EVs\ncontinues to grow, countries are proactively formulating systematic plans for\nnationwide electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVCI) to keep pace with\nthe accelerating shift towards EVs. This comprehensive review aims to\nthoroughly examine current global practices in EVCI planning and explore\nstate-of-the-art methodologies for designing EVCI planning strategies. Despite\nremarkable efforts by influential players in the global EV market, such as\nChina, the United States, and the European Union, the progress in EVCI rollout\nhas been notably slower than anticipated in the rest of the world. This delay\ncan be attributable to three major impediments: inadequate EVCI charging\nservices, low utilization rates of public EVCI facilities, and the non-trivial\nintegration of EVCI into the electric grid. This review dissects the interests\nof these stakeholders, clarifying their respective roles and expectations in\nthe context of EVCI planning. This review also provides insights into level 1,\n2, and 3 chargers with explorations of their applications in different\ngeographical locations for diverse EV charging patterns. Finally, a thorough\nreview of node-based and flow-based approaches to EV planning is presented. The\nmodeling of placing charging stations is broadly categorized into set coverage,\nmaximum coverage, flow-capturing, and flow-refueling location models. In\nconclusion, this review identifies several research gaps, including the dynamic\nmodeling of EV charging demand and the coordination of vehicle electrification\nwith grid decarbonization. This paper calls for further contributions to bridge\nthese gaps and drive the advancement of EVCI planning.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale recommendation systems are pivotal to process an immense volume\nof daily user interactions, requiring the effective modeling of high\ncardinality and heterogeneous features to ensure accurate predictions. In prior\nwork, we introduced Hierarchical Sequential Transducers (HSTU), an\nattention-based architecture for modeling high cardinality, non-stationary\nstreaming recommendation data, providing good scaling law in the generative\nrecommender framework (GR). Recent studies and experiments demonstrate that\nattending to longer user history sequences yields significant metric\nimprovements. However, scaling sequence length is activation-heavy,\nnecessitating parallelism solutions to effectively shard activation memory. In\ntransformer-based LLMs, context parallelism (CP) is a commonly used technique\nthat distributes computation along the sequence-length dimension across\nmultiple GPUs, effectively reducing memory usage from attention activations. In\ncontrast, production ranking models typically utilize jagged input tensors to\nrepresent user interaction features, introducing unique CP implementation\nchallenges. In this work, we introduce context parallelism with jagged tensor\nsupport for HSTU attention, establishing foundational capabilities for scaling\nup sequence dimensions. Our approach enables a 5.3x increase in supported user\ninteraction sequence length, while achieving a 1.55x scaling factor when\ncombined with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP).",

    "abstract": "In inaccessible environments with uncertain task demands, robots often rely\non general-purpose tools that lack predefined usage strategies. These tools are\nnot tailored for particular operations, making their longevity highly sensitive\nto how they are used. This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot\nlearn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool's\nlifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a\nfactor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element\nAnalysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based\non accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide\npolicy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL\ncan only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward\nNormalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on\nestimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across\nsimulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and\nDoor-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools. The learned policies\nconsistently prolong tool lifespan (up to 8.01x in simulation) and transfer\neffectively to real-world settings, demonstrating the practical value of\nlearning lifespan-guided tool use strategies.",

To address these gaps, we conducted a collaborative\nforecasting exercise with 22 practitioners in biostasis, including individuals\nwith expertise in neuroscience, cryobiology, and clinical care. Our results\nreveal substantial consensus in some areas, for example that synaptic\nconnectivity can serve as a reliable surrogate biomarker for information\npreservation quality. Practitioners identified three most likely failure modes\nin contemporary biostasis: inadequate preservation quality even under ideal\nconditions, geographic barriers preventing timely preservation, and poor\nprocedural execution. Regarding revival strategies, most respondents believe\nthat provably reversible cryopreservation of whole mammalian organisms is most\nlikely decades away, with provably reversible human cryopreservation expected\neven later, if it is ever achieved. Among revival strategies from contemporary\npreservation methods, whole brain emulation was considered the most likely to\nbe developed first, though respondents were divided on the metaphysical\nquestion of whether it could constitute genuine revival. Molecular\nnanotechnology was viewed as nearly as likely to be technically feasible, and\ncompatible with both pure cryopreservation and aldehyde-based methods.

Recent\nadvances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have significantly\nimproved automated test generation, garnering attention from both academia and\nindustry. We revisit LLM-based unit test generation from a novel perspective by\ndecoupling prefix generation and assertion generation. To characterize their\nrespective challenges, we define Initialization Complexity and adopt Cyclomatic\nComplexity to measure the difficulty of prefix and assertion generation,\nrevealing that the former primarily affects compilation success, while the\nlatter influences test coverage. To address these challenges, we propose\nSeed&Steer, a two-step approach that combines traditional unit testing\ntechniques with the capabilities of large language models. Seed&Steer leverages\nconventional unit testing tools (e.g., EvoSuite) to generate method invocations\nwith high compilation success rates, which serve as seeds to guide LLMs in\nconstructing effective test contexts. It then introduces branching cues to help\nLLMs explore diverse execution paths (e.g., normal, boundary, and exception\ncases) and generate assertions with high coverage. We evaluate Seed&Steer on\nfive real-world Java projects against state-of-the-art baselines.

We\naddress these challenges by developing a taxonomy of 25 tasks prompt\nprogrammers do and 51 questions they ask, measuring the importance of each task\nand question. We interview 16 prompt programmers, observe 8 developers make\nprompt changes, and survey 50 developers. We then compare the taxonomy with 48\nresearch and commercial tools.

However, the\ndensely populated users and diverse services with high data rate demands has\ntriggered an increasing scarcity of UAV spectrum utilization. To tackle this\nproblem, it is promising to incorporate the underutilized unlicensed spectrum\nwith the licensed spectrum to boost network capacity. However, the openness of\nunlicensed spectrum makes UAVs susceptible to security threats from potential\njammers. Therefore, a spectrum sharing UAV network coexisting with licensed\ncellular network and unlicensed Wi-Fi network is considered with the\nanti-jamming technique in this paper. The sum rate maximization of the\nsecondary network is studied by jointly optimizing the transmit power,\nsubchannel allocation, and UAV trajectory. We first decompose the challenging\nnon-convex problem into two subproblems, 1) the joint power and subchannel\nallocation and 2) UAV trajectory design subproblems. A low-complexity iterative\nalgorithm is proposed in a alternating optimization manner over these two\nsubproblems to solve the formulated problem. Specifically, the Lagrange dual\ndecomposition is exploited to jointly optimize the transmit power and\nsubchannel allocation iteratively. Then, an efficient iterative algorithm\ncapitalizing on successive convex approximation is designed to get a suboptimal\nsolution for UAV trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed\nalgorithm can significantly improve the sum transmission rate compared with the\nbenchmark schemes.",

We view the latent representations as a Gaussian ball rather than\ndeterministic points. Under the constraint of KL divergence, Gaussian ball\nregularizes the latent space, promoting a more uniform distribution of\nencodings. Furthermore, we show that reparameterization establishes a critical\ncontractual mechanism between the encoder and decoder, enabling the decoder to\nlearn how to reconstruct from these stochastic regions. We further connect this\nviewpoint with VQ-VAE, offering a unified perspective: VQ-VAE can be seen as an\nautoencoder where encodings are constrained to a set of cluster centers, with\nits generative capability arising from the compactness rather than its\nstochasticity.

Our approach enables the generation of both gapped and gapless\ntopological phases, including Dirac cone-like energy dispersions, topologically\nnontrivial flat bands, and protected edge states, all without resorting to\nsplit-step or split-coin protocols. Odd and even-site cyclic graphs exhibit\nmarkedly different spectral characteristics, with rotationally symmetric flat\nbands emerging exclusively in $4n$-site graphs ($n\\in \\mathbf{N}$). We\nanalytically establish the conditions for the emergence of topological, gapped\nflat bands and show that gap closings in rotation space imply the formation of\nDirac cones in momentum space. Further, we engineer protected edge states at\nthe interface between distinct topological phases in both odd and even cycle\ngraphs. We numerically demonstrate that the edge states are robust against\nmoderate static and dynamic gate disorder and remain stable against\nphase-preserving perturbations. This scheme serves as a resource-efficient and\nversatile platform for engineering topological phases, transitions, edge\nstates, and flat bands in quantum systems, opening new avenues for\nfault-tolerant quantum technologies.",

    "abstract": "Harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation systems has\nemerged as a prominent avenue, drawing substantial research interest. However,\nexisting approaches primarily involve basic prompt techniques for knowledge\nacquisition, which resemble System-1 thinking. This makes these methods highly\nsensitive to errors in the reasoning path, where even a small mistake can lead\nto an incorrect inference. To this end, in this paper, we propose $R^{4}$ec, a\nreasoning, reflection and refinement framework that evolves the recommendation\nsystem into a weak System-2 model. Specifically, we introduce two models: an\nactor model that engages in reasoning, and a reflection model that judges these\nresponses and provides valuable feedback. Then the actor model will refine its\nresponse based on the feedback, ultimately leading to improved responses. We\nemploy an iterative reflection and refinement process, enabling LLMs to\nfacilitate slow and deliberate System-2-like thinking. Ultimately, the final\nrefined knowledge will be incorporated into a recommendation backbone for\nprediction. We conduct extensive experiments on Amazon-Book and MovieLens-1M\ndatasets to demonstrate the superiority of $R^{4}$ec. We also deploy $R^{4}$ec\non a large scale online advertising platform, showing 2.2\\% increase of\nrevenue.

During inference, we apply a\nreasoning-aware next-token forcing strategy followed by report-level\nre-ranking, ensuring that the model first produces a comprehensive Findings\nsection before synthesizing the Impression and thereby preserving coherent\nclinical reasoning.

While SL reduces computational overhead on edge devices, it\nencounters significant challenges in heterogeneous environments where devices\nvary in computing resources, communication capabilities, environmental\nconditions, and privacy requirements. Although recent studies have explored\nheterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying\nresource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and\nlocal model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address\nthese limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split\nLearning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device\nsystems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a\npersonalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to\nachieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models\ntailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and\nprivacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers\nclients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without\nsharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources,\nenvironmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server. This approach\nbalances energy consumption and privacy leakage risks while maintaining high\nmodel accuracy.

The latter is a well-known result in relativistic quantum\nmechanics. Additionally, distinguishing between impermeable and permeable\nboundary conditions (BCs) at a point is not possible; for the latter type of\nBC, the pertinent current density cannot be zero at that point. We solve these\nfirst-quantized conflicts in detail by using a particular nontrivial local\nobservable -- an energy current density -- that allows us to characterize a\nstrictly neutral 1D KFG particle, i.e., a 1D KFG-Majorana (KFGM) particle, when\nit is confined to an interval and when it is, say, in an interval with\ntransparent walls. All the BCs for this system are extracted from the pseudo\nself-adjointness of the Feshbach-Villars (FV) Hamiltonian plus two Majorana\nconditions. We also show that this energy current density and a nontrivial\nenergy density satisfy a continuity equation when the Lorentz scalar\ninteraction present in the 1D KFG equations is time independent; in addition,\nthey always lead to a conserved quantity. Moreover, this energy current density\ncan characterize all available confining and nonconfining BCs. In contrast, the\ncommonly used energy current density -- a component of the energy-momentum\ntensor of the system -- cannot do so for all the BCs. Additionally, this latter\nquantity and its respective energy density -- another component of the\nenergy-momentum tensor -- do not necessarily lead to a conserved quantity.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit the formal verification problem for stochastic\ndynamical systems over finite horizon using barrier certificates. Most existing\nwork on this topic focuses on safety properties by constructing barrier\ncertificates based on the notion of $c$-martingales. In this work, we first\nprovide a new insight into the conditions of existing martingale-based barrier\ncertificates from the perspective of dynamic programming operators.\nSpecifically, we show that the existing conditions essentially provide a bound\non the dynamic programming solution, which exactly characterizes the safety\nprobability. Based on this new perspective, we demonstrate that the barrier\nconditions in existing approaches are unnecessarily conservative over unsafe\nstates. To address this, we propose a new set of safety barrier certificate\nconditions that are strictly less conservative than existing ones, thereby\nproviding tighter probability bounds for safety verification. We further extend\nour approach to the case of reach-avoid specifications by providing a set of\nnew barrier certificate conditions. We also illustrate how to search for these\nnew barrier certificates using sum-of-squares (SOS) programming. Finally, we\nuse two numerical examples to demonstrate the advantages of our method compared\nto existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Driven by the ``scale-is-everything'' paradigm, modern machine learning\nincreasingly demands ever-larger datasets and models, yielding prohibitive\ncomputational and storage requirements. Dataset distillation mitigates this by\ncompressing an original dataset into a small set of synthetic samples, while\npreserving its full utility. Yet, existing methods either maximize performance\nunder fixed storage budgets or pursue suitable synthetic data representations\nfor redundancy removal, without jointly optimizing both objectives. In this\nwork, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset\ndistillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes\ndecoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of\nquantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss\nas the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. To enable\nfair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise\nstorage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs. On\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128, our method achieves up to $170\\times$\ngreater compression than standard distillation at comparable accuracy. Across\ndiverse bpc budgets, distillation losses, and backbone architectures, our\napproach consistently establishes better rate-utility trade-offs.",

Yet, little is known about how closely\nLLMs align with human moral judgments. To address this, we introduce the Moral\nDilemma Dataset, a benchmark of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with a\ndistribution of human moral judgments consisting of a binary evaluation and a\nfree-text rationale. We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional\nalignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across\ndilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high\nconsensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In\nparallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions\nextracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral\nvalues than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch\nin both the distribution and diversity of values expressed. To close this gap,\nwe introduce Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), a Dirichlet-based sampling method\nthat conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles. DMP improves\nalignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity, offering a step toward more\npluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs.",

This paper proposes the use\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) to address this gap by facilitating the\nretrieval of relevant cases, generating explanations to elucidate relevance,\nand identifying core legal issues all autonomously, without requiring legal\nexpertise. Our approach combines Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with\nstructured summaries optimized for Indian case law. Leveraging the Augmented\nQuestion-guided Retrieval (AQgR) framework, the system generates targeted legal\nquestions based on factual scenarios to identify relevant case law more\neffectively. The structured summaries were assessed manually by legal experts,\ngiven the absence of a suitable structured summary dataset. Case law retrieval\nwas evaluated using the FIRE dataset, and explanations were reviewed by legal\nexperts, as explanation generation alongside case retrieval is an emerging\ninnovation. Experimental evaluation on a subset of the FIRE 2019 dataset\nyielded promising outcomes, achieving a Mean Average Precision (MAP) score of\n0.36 and a Mean Average Recall (MAR) of 0.67 across test queries, significantly\nsurpassing the current MAP benchmark of 0.1573. This work introduces a suite of\nnovel contributions to advance case law retrieval.

Given a\nlarge input network $G$, a motif $H$ is a small \"pattern\" graph indicative of\nspecial local structure. Motif/pattern mining involves finding all matches of\nthis pattern in the input $G$. The simplest, yet challenging, case of motif\ncounting is when $H$ has three vertices, often called a \"triadic\" query. Recent\nwork has focused on \"temporal graph mining\", where the network $G$ has edges\nwith timestamps (and directions) and $H$ has time constraints.\n  Inspired by concepts in logic and database theory, we introduce the study of\n\"thresholded First Order Logic (FOL) Motif Analysis\" for massive temporal\nnetworks. A typical triadic motif query asks for the existence of three\nvertices that form a desired temporal pattern. An \"FOL\" motif query is obtained\nby having both existential and thresholded universal quantifiers. This allows\nfor query semantics that can mine richer information from networks. A typical\ntriadic query would be \"find all triples of vertices $u,v,w$ such that they\nform a triangle within one hour\". A thresholded FOL query can express \"find all\npairs $u,v$ such that for half of $w$ where $(u,w)$ formed an edge, $(v,w)$\nalso formed an edge within an hour\".\n  We design the first algorithm, FOLTY, for mining thresholded FOL triadic\nqueries. The theoretical running time of FOLTY matches the best known running\ntime for temporal triangle counting in sparse graphs. We give an efficient\nimplementation of FOLTY using specialized temporal data structures. FOLTY has\nexcellent empirical behavior, and can answer triadic FOL queries on graphs with\nnearly 70M edges is less than hour on commodity hardware.

The strain energy\ndensity potentials are expressed as isotropic functions of the right\nCauchy-Green deformation tensor, along with structural tensors that encode\nanisotropy either present in the virgin material or resulting from damage. To\nguarantee the polyconvexity condition, non-decreasing convex neural networks\nwith inputs that ensure polyconvexity are used to parameterize the strain\nenergy density potentials. The model vanishes in the undeformed state,\nfulfilling the normality condition. In contrast to classical [1-d] damage\nmodels, the expressiveness of the new data-driven model is enhanced by\nemploying a family of nonlinear, convex, decreasing functions to capture the\neffect of damage. Damage evolution is governed through a damage potential,\nwhere the corresponding threshold is defined in terms of the damage conjugate\nforces. As a special case of the general formulation, a new anisotropic generic\nformat is introduced to predict constitutive responses under damage-induced\nanisotropy in initially isotropic materials. To reduce the computational burden\nduring training, a decoupled training scheme is introduced, and its accuracy is\ndemonstrated in all numerical examples.

Deep learning models,\nespecially graph neural networks (GNNs), have accelerated prediction\ngeneration, but the sheer volume of outputs makes manual selection for\nvalidation unscalable. Large language models (LLMs) offer promise in filtering\nand hypothesis generation, yet suffer from hallucinations and lack grounding in\nstructured knowledge, limiting their reliability. To address these issues, we\npropose HypoChainer, a collaborative visualization framework that integrates\nhuman expertise, LLM-driven reasoning, and knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance\nhypothesis generation and validation. HypoChainer operates in three stages:\nFirst, exploration and contextualization -- experts use retrieval-augmented\nLLMs (RAGs) and dimensionality reduction to navigate large-scale GNN\npredictions, assisted by interactive explanations. Second, hypothesis chain\nformation -- experts iteratively examine KG relationships around predictions\nand semantically linked entities, refining hypotheses with LLM and KG\nsuggestions. Third, validation prioritization -- refined hypotheses are\nfiltered based on KG-supported evidence to identify high-priority candidates\nfor experimentation, with visual analytics further strengthening weak links in\nreasoning. We demonstrate HypoChainer's effectiveness through case studies in\ntwo domains and expert interviews, highlighting its potential to support\ninterpretable, scalable, and knowledge-grounded scientific discovery.",

Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is\nused to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these\ncourses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than\ntheir first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker\nstatus affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based\ncomputing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the\nsentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We\nthen relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language\nbackground. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less\nfavorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less\npositive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant\ninteractions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but\ncomplex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.",

    "abstract": "In observational studies, contingency tables provide a simple and intuitive\napproach to study associations between categorical variables. However, any test\nof association in contingency tables may be biased due to unmeasured\nconfounders. Existing sensitivity analyses that assess the impact of unmeasured\nconfounding on association tests typically assume a binary treatment variable\nor impose strong parametric assumptions on the non-binary treatment variable.\nWe overcome these limitations with an exact (i.e., non-asymptotic) and\nnonparametric sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in $I \\times J$\nor $I \\times J \\times K$ contingency tables, accommodating both non-binary\ntreatment and non-binary outcome. Specifically, we extend Rosenbaum's\nsensitivity model for generic bias and develop a general method to calculate\nthe exact worst-case null distribution for any permutation-invariant test,\nwhich includes the chi-square test and many likelihood-based or score-based\ntests of association. We also propose specialized results for sub-families of\npermutation-invariant tests that lead to more efficient computation of the\nworst-case null distribution. Finally, we show that sensitivity analyses based\non tests that utilize all treatment and outcome levels typically have higher\npower than \"naive\" approaches that dichotomize the categorical variables.

While traditional video\nclassification models effectively handle well-defined moderation tasks, they\nstruggle with complicated scenarios such as implicit harmful content and\ncontextual ambiguity. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a\npromising solution to these limitations with their superior cross-modal\nreasoning and contextual understanding. However, two key challenges hinder\ntheir industrial adoption. First, the high computational cost of MLLMs makes\nfull-scale deployment impractical. Second, adapting generative models for\ndiscriminative classification remains an open research problem. In this paper,\nwe first introduce an efficient method to transform a generative MLLM into a\nmultimodal classifier using minimal discriminative training data. To enable\nindustry-scale deployment, we then propose a router-ranking cascade system that\nintegrates MLLMs with a lightweight router model. Offline experiments\ndemonstrate that our MLLM-based approach improves F1 score by 66.50% over\ntraditional classifiers while requiring only 2% of the fine-tuning data.

Upon doping, a pseudogap (PG) phase\nemerges - marked by selective gapping of the Fermi surface without conventional\nsymmetry breaking in spin or charge channels. A key challenge is understanding\nhow quasiparticle breakdown in the Fermi liquid gives rise to this enigmatic\nstate, and how it connects to both the Mott insulating and superconducting\nphases. Here, we develop a renormalization-based construction of strongly\ncorrelated lattice models that captures the emergence of the pseudogap phase\nand its transition to a Mott insulator. Applying a many-body tiling scheme to\nthe fixed-point impurity model uncovers a lattice model with electron\ninteractions and Kondo physics. At half-filling, the interplay between Kondo\nscreening and bath charge fluctuations in the impurity model leads to Fermi\nliquid breakdown. This reveals a pseudogap phase characterized by a non-Fermi\nliquid (the Mott metal) residing on nodal arcs, gapped antinodal regions of the\nFermi surface, and an anomalous scaling of the electronic scattering rate with\nfrequency. The eventual confinement of holon-doublon excitations of this exotic\nmetal obtains a continuous transition into the Mott insulator. Our results\nidentify the pseudogap as a distinct long-range entangled quantum phase, and\noffer a new route to Mott criticality beyond the paradigm of local quantum\ncriticality.",

Two key bottlenecks are private data\nrepositories' locality constraints and the need to maintain compatibility with\nmainstream search techniques, particularly Hierarchical Navigable Small World\n(HNSW) indexing for high-dimensional vector spaces.

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) advances into diverse applications, ensuring\nreliability of AI models is increasingly critical. Conventional neural networks\noffer strong predictive capabilities but produce deterministic outputs without\ninherent uncertainty estimation, limiting their reliability in safety-critical\ndomains. Probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), which introduce randomness, have\nemerged as a powerful approach for enabling intrinsic uncertainty\nquantification. However, traditional CMOS architectures are inherently designed\nfor deterministic operation and actively suppress intrinsic randomness. This\nposes a fundamental challenge for implementing PNNs, as probabilistic\nprocessing introduces significant computational overhead. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce a Magnetic Probabilistic Computing (MPC) platform-an\nenergy-efficient, scalable hardware accelerator that leverages intrinsic\nmagnetic stochasticity for uncertainty-aware computing. This physics-driven\nstrategy utilizes spintronic systems based on magnetic domain walls (DWs) and\ntheir dynamics to establish a new paradigm of physical probabilistic computing\nfor AI. The MPC platform integrates three key mechanisms: thermally induced DW\nstochasticity, voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), and tunneling\nmagnetoresistance (TMR), enabling fully electrical and tunable probabilistic\nfunctionality at the device level. As a representative demonstration, we\nimplement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) inference structure and validate its\nfunctionality on CIFAR-10 classification tasks. Compared to standard 28nm CMOS\nimplementations, our approach achieves a seven orders of magnitude improvement\nin the overall figure of merit, with substantial gains in area efficiency,\nenergy consumption, and speed.

However, when\nincreasing intra-class variation, existing methods overlook the necessity of\nmaintaining intra-class identity consistency. % To address this and generate\nhigh-quality face training data, we propose Vec2Face+, a generative model that\ncreates images directly from image features and allows for continuous and easy\ncontrol of face identities and attributes. Using Vec2Face+, we obtain datasets\nwith proper inter-class separability and intra-class variation and identity\nconsistency using three strategies: 1) we sample vectors sufficiently different\nfrom others to generate well-separated identities; 2) we propose an AttrOP\nalgorithm for increasing general attribute variations; 3) we propose LoRA-based\npose control for generating images with profile head poses, which is more\nefficient and identity-preserving than AttrOP. % Our system generates VFace10K,\na synthetic face dataset with 10K identities, which allows an FR model to\nachieve state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world test sets. Scaling the\nsize to 4M and 12M images, the corresponding VFace100K and VFace300K datasets\nyield higher accuracy than the real-world training dataset, CASIA-WebFace, on\nfive real-world test sets.

Using difference-in-differences methods,\nI find that these quotas enabled scholarship students to access more selective\nprograms, although the intention-to-treat effects remain modest. Matching\nmethods reveal that the policy improved the scholarship students' waiting list\npositions relative to those of comparable non-scholarship peers, and\nsimulations suggest that the modest effect could be attributed to the low\nintensity of the treatment. However, I detect no robust or lasting effects on\nthe extensive margin of higher education access. Despite high policy salience,\nquotas did not affect the application behavior or pre-college investment of\nscholarship students, even among high achievers. These findings align with\nresearch on affirmative action, suggesting that such policies primarily benefit\ndisadvantaged students who access selective institutions, rather than expanding\ntotal enrollment.

The staggered\nrollout of treatment introduces complexities in defining and estimating\ntreatment effect estimands, particularly under informative sizes. Traditional\nmodel-based methods, including generalized estimating equations (GEE) and\nlinear mixed models (LMM), produce estimates that depend on implicit weighting\nschemes and parametric assumptions, leading to bias for different types of\nestimands in the presence of informative sizes. While recent methods have\nattempted to provide robust estimation in SW-CRTs, they are restrictive on\nmodeling assumptions or lack of general framework for consistent estimating\nmultiple estimands under informative size. In this article, we propose a\nmodel-robust standardization framework for SW-CRTs that generalizes existing\nmethods from parallel-arm CRTs. We define causal estimands including\nhorizontal-individual, horizontal-cluster, vertical-individual, and\nvertical-cluster average treatment effects under a super population framework\nand introduce an augmented standardization estimator that standardizes\nparametric and semiparametric working models while maintaining robustness to\ninformative cluster size under arbitrary misspecification.

    "abstract": "In the current practices of both industry and academia, the convergence and\naccuracy of finite element calculations are closely related to the methods and\nquality of mesh generation. For years, the research on high-quality mesh\ngeneration in the domestic academic field has mainly referred to the local\nquality of quadrilaterals and hexahedrons approximating that of squares and\ncubes. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a brand-new research\ndirection and content: it is necessary to explore and study the influence of\nthe overall global arrangement structure and pattern of super structured\nquadrilateral meshes on the convergence and calculation accuracy of finite\nelement calculations. Through the research in this new field, it can help solve\nthe non-rigorous state of serious reliance on \"experience\" in the mesh\ngeneration stage during simulation in the current industry and academia, and\nmake clear judgments on which global arrangements of mesh generation can ensure\nthe convergence of finite element calculations. In order to generate and design\nsuper-structured quadrilateral meshes with controllable overall arrangement\nstructures, a large number of modern two-dimensional and three-dimensional\ngeometric topology theories are required, such as moduli space, Teichm\\\"uller\nspace, harmonic foliations, dynamical systems, surface mappings, meromorphic\nquadratic differentials, surface mappings, etc.",

Existing methods generally rely on single-level visual features,\nlimiting their ability to capture complex distortions in AIGC images. To\naddress this limitation, a multi-level visual representation paradigm is\nproposed with three stages, namely multi-level feature extraction, hierarchical\nfusion, and joint aggregation. Based on this paradigm, two networks are\ndeveloped. Specifically, the Multi-Level Global-Local Fusion Network (MGLF-Net)\nis designed for the perceptual quality assessment, extracting complementary\nlocal and global features via dual CNN and Transformer visual backbones. The\nMulti-Level Prompt-Embedded Fusion Network (MPEF-Net) targets Text-to-Image\ncorrespondence by embedding prompt semantics into the visual feature fusion\nprocess at each feature level. The fused multi-level features are then\naggregated for final evaluation. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate\noutstanding performance on both tasks, validating the effectiveness of the\nproposed multi-level visual assessment paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Data perturbation-based privacy-preserving methods have been widely adopted\nin various scenarios due to their efficiency and the elimination of the need\nfor a trusted third party. However, these methods primarily focus on individual\nstatistical indicators, neglecting the overall quality of the collected data\nfrom a distributional perspective. Consequently, they often fall short of\nmeeting the diverse statistical analysis requirements encountered in practical\ndata analysis. As a promising sensitive data perturbation method, negative\nsurvey methods is able to complete the task of collecting sensitive information\ndistribution while protecting personal privacy. Yet, existing negative survey\nmethods are primarily designed for discrete sensitive information and are\ninadequate for real-valued data distributions. To bridge this gap, this paper\nproposes a novel real-value negative survey model, termed RVNS, for the first\ntime in the field of real-value sensitive information collection. The RVNS\nmodel exempts users from the necessity of discretizing their data and only\nrequires them to sample a set of data from a range that deviates from their\nactual sensitive details, thereby preserving the privacy of their genuine\ninformation. Moreover, to accurately capture the distribution of sensitive\ninformation, an optimization problem is formulated, and a novel approach is\nemployed to solve it. Rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that the RVNS\nmodel conforms to the differential privacy model, ensuring robust privacy\npreservation. Comprehensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets further validate the efficacy of the proposed method.",

This is particularly\nimportant for marketing (e.g., targeting influencers for a marketing campaign)\nand to understand the dynamics of information diffusion (e.g., who is the most\ncentral user in the spreading of a certain type of information). However,\ndifferent opinions often split the audience and make the network polarised. In\npolarised networks, information becomes soiled within communities in the\nnetwork, and the most influential user within a network might not be the most\ninfluential across all communities. Additionally, influential users and their\ninfluence may change over time as users may change their opinion or choose to\ndecrease or halt their engagement on the subject. In this work, we aim to study\nthe temporal dynamics of users' influence in a polarised social network. We\ncompare the stability of influence ranking using temporal centrality measures,\nwhile extending them to account for community structure across a number of\nnetwork evolution behaviours. We show that we can successfully aggregate nodes\ninto influence bands, and how to aggregate centrality scores to analyse the\ninfluence of communities over time.

Firstly, a Ghost-HGNetv2 structure with fewer parameters is used in the\nbackbone network, and multilevel features are used to extract image semantic\nfeatures to discover accurate defects. Secondly, we integrate C2f-Faster with\nsmall number of parameters in the neck section to enhance the ability of\nmulti-level feature fusion. Next, in the Head part, we design a new GCDetect\ndetection head, which allows the prediction of bounding boxes and categories to\nshare the weights of GroupConv, and uses a small number of grouping\nconvolutions to accomplish the regression and classification tasks, which\nsignificantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the accuracy\nof detection.

Specifically, we\nconsider a bordism category whose objects are surfaces with markings from the\ncategory of cochains Ch(A) over a given modular tensor category (such as the\ncategory of small quantum group representations), and whose morphisms are\n3-dimensional bordisms with embedded ribbon graphs traveling between such\nmarked surfaces. We construct a symmetric monoidal functor from the\naforementioned ribbon bordism category to the category of linear cochains. The\nvalues of this theory on surfaces are identified with Hom complexes for Ch(A),\nand the 3-manifold invariants are alternating sums of the renormalized\nLyubashenko invariant from [DGGPR23].\n  We show that our cochain valued TQFT furthermore preserves homotopies, and\nhence localizes to a theory which takes values in the derived $\\infty$-category\nof dg vector spaces. The domain for this $\\infty$-categorical theory is, up to\nsome approximation, an $\\infty$-category of ribbon bordism with labels in the\nhomotopy $\\infty$-category K(A).

TDR\ncomprises multiple independently controlled robot segments, each with a set of\ndriving tendons. While increasing the number of robot segments enhances\ndexterity and expands the workspace, this structural expansion also introduces\nintensified inter-segmental coupling. Therefore, achieving precise TDR control\nrequires more complex models and additional motors. This paper presents a\nreconfigurable tendon-driven robot (RTR) equipped with innovative lockable\njoints. Each joint's state (locked/free) can be individually controlled through\na pair of antagonistic tendons, and its structure eliminates the need for a\ncontinuous power supply to maintain the state. Operators can selectively\nactuate the targeted robot segments, and this scheme fundamentally eliminates\nthe inter-segmental coupling, thereby avoiding the requirement for complex\ncoordinated control between segments. The workspace of RTR has been simulated\nand compared with traditional TDRs' workspace, and RTR's advantages are further\nrevealed. The kinematics and statics models of the RTR have been derived and\nvalidation experiments have been conducted.

    "abstract": "Modern network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) frequently utilize the\npredictive power of complex deep learning models. However, the \"black-box\"\nnature of such deep learning methods adds a layer of opaqueness that hinders\nthe proper understanding of detection decisions, trust in the decisions and\nprevent timely countermeasures against such attacks. Explainable AI (XAI)\nmethods provide a solution to this problem by providing insights into the\ncauses of the predictions. The majority of the existing XAI methods provide\nexplanations which are not convenient to convert into actionable\ncountermeasures. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based\ncounterfactual explanation framework that can provide actionable explanations\nfor network intrusion attacks. We evaluated our proposed algorithm against\nseveral other publicly available counterfactual explanation algorithms on 3\nmodern network intrusion datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work also\npresents the first comparative analysis of existing counterfactual explanation\nalgorithms within the context of network intrusion detection systems. Our\nproposed method provide minimal, diverse counterfactual explanations out of the\ntested counterfactual explanation algorithms in a more efficient manner by\nreducing the time to generate explanations. We also demonstrate how\ncounterfactual explanations can provide actionable explanations by summarizing\nthem to create a set of global rules.

Below the\nN\\'eel temperature, the gap opens along with ``weak magnetism'', accompanied by\na discontinuity in the magnetic susceptibility. Most other properties remain\ncontinuous. Without explicit correlation in the band structure calculation, and\nneglecting spin-orbit coupling (SOC), already a gap opens. Inclusion of a\nmodest on-site Coulomb repulsion ($U\\sim$ 1 eV) is sufficient to eliminate a\nSOC-induced small band overlap, reproducing the experimentally observed gap of\nseveral tens meV as reported earlier. This evidence supports the viewpoint that\nNaOsO$_3$ lies in an unusual crossover region between Slater and Mott\ninsulator. The unreported altermagnetism in NaOsO$_3$ is demonstrated and its\nconsequences are considered. The origin of the very weak magnetism has been\ninvestigated using a combination of {\\it ab initio} calculations and symmetry\nanalysis of the magnetic space group, confirming the origin lying in the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya spin-orbit coupling buttressed by altermagnetic order.\nAfter determining the easy axis, our calculation leads to an Os spin canting\nangle of about 3$^{\\circ}$, accounting for the observed weak magnetism and the\nresulting discontinuity in the susceptibility. The altermagnetism spin-split\nbands (up to $\\sim$100 meV) result in a chiral-split magnon spectrum in both\nacoustic and optical modes in the THz range, and lead to significant anomalous\nHall conductivity upon hole doping.",

Existing wearable smart ECG solutions suffer from high power\nconsumption in both ECG diagnosis and transmission for high accuracy.\nMonitoring of ECG devices is mainly done by data extraction and acquisition,\npre-processing, feature extraction, processing and analysis, visualisation and\nauxiliary procedures. During the pre-processing of the information, different\nkinds of noise generated during the signal collection need to be taken into\naccount. The quality of the signal-to-noise ratio can usually be improved by\noptimising algorithms and reducing the noise power. The choice of electrodes\nusually has a direct impact on the signal-to-noise ratio and the user\nexperience, and conventional Ag/AgCl gel electrodes are not suitable for\nlong-term and dynamic monitoring as they are prone to skin irritation,\ninflammation and allergic reactions. Therefore, a completely new way of\ncombining electrodes and wires will be used in the report. The electrodes and\nwires are cut in one piece from a silver-plated fabric. The wire portion is cut\ninto a curved structure close to an S shape to ensure that it has good\nductility for comfort and signal integrity during daily movement of the\ngarment.",

This study\ninvestigates the potential of SIM in enhancing the rate fairness in multiuser\ndownlink systems by addressing two key optimization problems: maximizing the\nminimum rate (MR) and maximizing the geometric mean of rates (GMR). {The former\nstrives to enhance the minimum user rate, thereby ensuring fairness among\nusers, while the latter relaxes fairness requirements to strike a better\ntrade-off between user fairness and system sum-rate (SR).} For the MR\nmaximization, we adopt a consensus alternating direction method of multipliers\n(ADMM)-based approach, which decomposes the approximated problem into\nsub-problems with closed-form solutions. {For GMR maximization, we develop an\nalternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that also yields closed-form\nsolutions and can be seamlessly adapted for SR maximization. Numerical results\nvalidate the effectiveness and convergence of the proposed algorithms.}\nComparative evaluations show that MR maximization ensures near-perfect\nfairness, while GMR maximization balances fairness and system SR. Furthermore,\nthe two proposed algorithms respectively outperform existing related works in\nterms of MR and SR performance.

Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships,\noverlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although\nthe Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its\napplication to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The\nvariability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the\nlabel space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM\nfocuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained\nspatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations\nand cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing\npre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge\nto alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a\nfeature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same\nfeature space and efficiently combine different representations.

However, the traditional centralized\nlearning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and\ntrained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized\napproaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing\nmodel training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these\nmethods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data\nand suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the\naggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of\nclinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously\nlearning from diverse modalities and multilabels.

    "abstract": "In the context of labor shortages and rising costs, construction robots are\nregarded as the key to revolutionizing traditional construction methods and\nimproving efficiency and quality in the construction industry. In order to\nensure that construction robots can perform tasks efficiently and accurately in\ncomplex construction environments, traditional single-objective trajectory\noptimization methods are difficult to meet the complex requirements of the\nchanging construction environment. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective\ntrajectory optimization for the robotic arm used in the curtain wall\ninstallation. First, we design a robotic arm for curtain wall installation,\nintegrating serial, parallel, and folding arm elements, while considering its\nphysical properties and motion characteristics. In addition, this paper\nproposes an NSGA-III-FO algorithm (NSGA-III with Focused Operator, NSGA-III-FO)\nthat incorporates a focus operator screening mechanism to accelerate the\nconvergence of the algorithm towards the Pareto front, thereby effectively\nbalancing the multi-objective constraints of construction robots. The proposed\nalgorithm is tested against NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and MSOPS-II in ten consecutive\ntrials on the DTLZ3 and WFG3 test functions, showing significantly better\nconvergence efficiency than the other algorithms. Finally, we conduct two sets\nof experiments on the designed robotic arm platform, which confirm the\nefficiency and practicality of the NSGA-III-FO algorithm in solving\nmulti-objective trajectory planning problems for curtain wall installation\ntasks.",

In this\npaper, we obtain a deeper insight into how the supersymmetry works by\nconstructing the gauge invariant, Lorentz covariant supercurrent $j_{\\mu A}$.\nIts conservation relies crucially on the presence of a quantum anomaly. We\ngeneralize this construction to a class of models where, in addition to an\nadjoint Majorana fermion of an appropriate mass, the gauge theory is coupled to\nsome collection of massless fermions ($SU(N)$ may be replaced by a more general\ngauge group). In general, these models have a supersymmetric massive sector and\na non-supersymmetric CFT sector [arXiv:2202.04017], but there are cases in\nwhich both sectors are supersymmetric.

    "abstract": "Inverse probability weighting (IPW) methods are commonly used to analyze\nnon-ignorable missing data under the assumption of a logistic model for the\nmissingness probability. However, solving IPW equations numerically may involve\nnon-convergence problems when the sample size is moderate and the missingness\nprobability is high. Moreover, those equations often have multiple roots, and\nidentifying the best root is challenging. Therefore, IPW methods may have low\nefficiency or even produce biased results. We identify the pitfall in these\nmethods pathologically: they involve the estimation of a moment-generating\nfunction, and such functions are notoriously unstable in general. As a remedy,\nwe model the outcome distribution given the covariates of the completely\nobserved individuals semiparametrically. After forming an induced logistic\nregression model for the missingness status of the outcome and covariate, we\ndevelop a maximum conditional likelihood method to estimate the underlying\nparameters. The proposed method circumvents the estimation of a\nmoment-generating function and hence overcomes the instability of IPW methods.\nOur theoretical and simulation results show that the proposed method\noutperforms existing competitors greatly. Two real data examples are analyzed\nto illustrate the advantages of our method. We conclude that if only a\nparametric logistic regression is assumed but the outcome regression model is\nleft arbitrary, then one has to be cautious in using any of the existing\nstatistical methods in problems involving non-ignorable missing data.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks but\nsuffer from high computational costs due to their iterative sampling process\nand quadratic attention costs. Existing training-free acceleration strategies\nthat reduce per-step computation cost, while effectively reducing sampling\ntime, demonstrate low faithfulness compared to the original baseline. We\nhypothesize that this fidelity gap arises because (a) different prompts\ncorrespond to varying denoising trajectory, and (b) such methods do not\nconsider the underlying ODE formulation and its numerical solution. In this\npaper, we propose Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration (SADA), a\nnovel paradigm that unifies step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions via a\nsingle stability criterion to accelerate sampling of ODE-based generative\nmodels (Diffusion and Flow-matching). For (a), SADA adaptively allocates\nsparsity based on the sampling trajectory. For (b), SADA introduces principled\napproximation schemes that leverage the precise gradient information from the\nnumerical ODE solver.

To overcome these\nlimitations, this paper proposes a model-free approach using Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) for fault diagnosis in induction machines. The focus is on\ndetecting multiple fault types -- including eccentricity, bearing defects, and\nbroken rotor bars -- under varying severity levels and load conditions. Unlike\ntraditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct\ninputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature\nextraction.

Testing its validity offers a powerful tool to probe\nnew physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, for the first\ntime, we present a novel consistency test of CDDR by combining HII galaxy data\nwith a comprehensive set of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements.\nThe BAO measurements include two-dimensional (2D) BAO and three-dimensional\n(3D) BAO, as well as the latest 3D BAO data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic\nInstrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2). We adopt four different\nparameterizations of the CDDR parameter, $\\eta(z)$, to investigate possible\ndeviations and their evolution with cosmic time. To ensure accurate redshift\nmatching across datasets, we reconstruct the distance measures through a\nmodel-independent Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach. Our analysis\nuniquely examines two distinct approaches: $i)$ marginalization over the BAO\nsound horizon $r_d$, and $ii)$ fixing $r_d$ to specific values. We find no\nsignificant deviation from the CDDR (less than 68% confidence level) in either\nthe marginalized $r_d$ or the $r_d=147.05$ Mpc scenario. However, a slight\ndeviation at the 68% confidence level is found when applying 2D-BAO data with\n$r_d=139.5$ Mpc. Furthermore, our analysis shows that all BAO data considered\nin this work support the validity of the CDDR, where 3D-DESI BAO provides the\ntightest constraints. We find no tension between 2D and 3D BAO measurements,\nwhich confirms their mutual consistency. In addition, the treatment of the\nsound horizon $r_d$ significantly impacts $\\eta(z)$ constraints, which proves\nits importance in CDDR tests. Finally, the consistency of our results supports\nthe standard CDDR and demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.",

Disentangled representation learning\nprovides an effective solution to model complex user preferences by separating\nintra-domain features (domain-shared and domain-specific features), thereby\nenhancing robustness and interpretability. However, disentanglement-based CDR\nmethods employing generative modeling or GNNs with contrastive objectives face\ntwo key challenges: (i) pre-separation strategies decouple features before\nextracting collaborative signals, disrupting intra-domain interactions and\nintroducing noise; (ii) unsupervised disentanglement objectives lack explicit\ntask-specific guidance, resulting in limited consistency and suboptimal\nalignment. To address these challenges, we propose DGCDR, a GNN-enhanced\nencoder-decoder framework. To handle challenge (i), DGCDR first applies GNN to\nextract high-order collaborative signals, providing enriched representations as\na robust foundation for disentanglement.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a key post-pretraining step for aligning large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with complex tasks and human preferences. While it is\noften assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's\nparameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL\nfine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of\nweights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced\nparameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity\nconstraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL\nalgorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI,\nMeta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show\nsubstantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far\nexceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the\npretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers\nfull model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully\nfine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL\noperates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted\nchanges. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited\neffect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts\nmodels: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small,\nconsistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods\nand reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis.",

Simulations show that it is in fact the\nmean-motion resonances of the inner giant planet that drive the dynamics of the\nprotoplanetary disk and the mass and orbital architecture of the final bodies.\nSimulations also show that in the majority of the cases, the final systems\ncontain only one terrestrial planet with a mass of 0.6-1.7 Earth masses.\nMultiple planets appear on rare occasions in the form of Earth-Mars analogs\nwith the smaller planet in an exterior orbit. When giant planets are in larger\norbits, the number of these double-planet systems increases and their planets\nbecome more massive. Results also show that when the orbits of the giant\nplanets carry inclinations, while secular resonances are still suppressed,\nmean-motion resonances are strongly enhanced, drastically reducing the efficacy\nof the formation process. We present the results of our simulations and discuss\ntheir implications.",

The potential contains three flat regions, one for inflation,\nanother for early dark energy and the third for late dark energy. At a certain\npoint, as the matter dilutes, tunneling from the early dark energy to the late\ndark energy can start efficiently. This mechanism naturally alleviated the\nobserved Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon prior to recombination\nwhile preserving late-time cosmology.

While recent works on GPU-based acceleration\nhave significantly advanced ANNS performance, the ever-growing scale of\ndatasets now demands efficient multi-GPU solutions. However, the design of\nexisting works overlooks multi-GPU scalability, resulting in naive approaches\nthat treat additional GPUs as a means to extend memory capacity for large\ndatasets. This inefficiency arises from partitioning the dataset and\nindependently searching for data points similar to the queries in each GPU. We\ntherefore propose PathWeaver, a novel multi-GPU framework designed to scale and\naccelerate ANNS for large datasets. First, we propose pipelining-based path\nextension, a GPU-aware pipelining mechanism that reduces prior work's redundant\nsearch iterations by leveraging GPU-to-GPU communication. Second, we design\nghost staging that leverages a representative dataset to identify optimal query\nstarting points, reducing the search space for challenging queries. Finally, we\nintroduce direction-guided selection, a data selection technique that filters\nirrelevant points early in the search process, minimizing unnecessary memory\naccesses and distance computations. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse\ndatasets demonstrate that PathWeaver achieves 3.24$\\times$ geomean speedup and\nup to 5.30$\\times$ speedup on 95% recall rate over state-of-the-art\nmulti-GPU-based ANNS frameworks.",

As the first\nphase of our project, we present here the general theory of secular resonances\nin dual-star systems where the primary hosts two giant planets. Using the\nconcept of generalized disturbing function, we derive the formula for the\nlocations of secular resonances and show that in systems where the perturbation\nof the secondary star is stronger, the locations of secular resonances are\nfarther way from the primary and closer to the giant planets. The latter\nimplies that in such systems, terrestrial planet formation has a larger area to\nproceed with more of the protoplanetary disk being available to it. To\ndemonstrate the validity of our theoretical results, we simulated the evolution\nof a protoplanetary disk interior to the inner giant planet. Results, in\naddition to confirming our theoretical predictions, pointed to an important\nfinding: In binary stars, the perturbation of the secondary suppresses the\nsecular resonances of giant planets. Simulations also show that as the disk\nloses material, secular resonances move inward, scattering objects out of the\ndisk and/or facilitating their collisional growth.

    "abstract": "Viscous drag results from the fluid at a surface having zero relative\nvelocity, a phenomenon known as the no-slip condition. Superhydrophobic\nsurfaces, when submerged in water, trap a layer of air in their surface\ntexture, partially replacing the liquid-solid interface with a liquid-gas\ninterface. This air layer, called the plastron, results in partial slip at the\nsurface, thereby reducing the viscous drag. In turbulent flows, large\nfluctuations in pressure and velocity can deplete or completely remove the\nplastron from the surface. This makes evaluating the effects of\nsuperhydrophobic surface treatments on flow dynamics particularly challenging.\nThis study examines the impact of a sustained plastron on flow dynamics in the\nwake of a sphere, achieved by supplying air at low pressure through pores in\nthe sphere's surface. Instantaneous planar velocities in the wakes of spheres,\nboth with and without superhydrophobic surface treatment, are measured within a\nplane passing through the sphere's centre. Dynamic mode decomposition is\napplied to the velocity fluctuations in the wake to evaluate how\nsuperhydrophobic surface treatments affect flow dynamics in the near wake. It\nis shown that the addition of the pores has a relatively small effect on the\ndynamics in the wake of the sphere, while the dynamics in the wake are\nradically changed by the addition of superhydrophobic surface treatment when\nthe plastron is sustained.",
