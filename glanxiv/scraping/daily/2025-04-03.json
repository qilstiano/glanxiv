Our contributions to this study are fourfold.\nFirst, we manually analyzed 663 SO questions that discussed challenges related\nto XAI techniques.

We then analyzed their prevalence and\nfound that model integration and disagreement issues emerged as the most\nprevalent challenges. Second, we attempt to estimate the severity of each XAI\nchallenge by determining the correlation between challenge types and answer\nmetadata (e.g., the presence of accepted answers).

Third, we attempt to\nperceive the severity of these challenges based on practitioners' ability to\nuse XAI techniques effectively in their work.

In response, hardware manufacturers have begun\nto incorporate so-called Neural Processing Units (NPUs) into their processors\nfor consumer devices. Such dedicated hardware optimizes both power efficiency\nand throughput for common machine learning tasks. AMD's NPU, part of their\nRyzen AI processors, is one of the first such accelerators integrated into a\nchip with an x86 processor. AMD supports bare-metal programming of their NPU\nrather than limiting programmers to pre-configured libraries.\n  In this paper, we explore the potential of using a bare-metal toolchain to\naccelerate the weight fine-tuning of a large language model, GPT-2, entirely on\nthe client side using the AMD NPU. Fine-tuning on the edge allows for private\ncustomization of a model to a specific use case. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first time such an accelerator has been used to perform training on\nthe client side. We offload time-intensive matrix multiplication operations\nfrom the CPU onto the NPU, achieving a speedup of over 2.8x for these\noperations. This improves end-to-end performance of the model in terms of\nthroughput (1.7x and 1.2x speedup in FLOPS/s on mains and battery power,\nrespectively) and energy efficiency (1.4x improvement in FLOPS/Ws on battery\npower).

Despite recent progress in the design of efficient\n$\\Delta$-coloring algorithms, there is currently a polynomial gap between the\nupper and lower bounds.\n  In this work we present a $O(\\log n)$-round deterministic $\\Delta$-coloring\nalgorithm for dense constant-degree graphs, matching the lower bound for the\nproblem on general graphs.

One such threat is the\npresence of Reconnecting Malicious Clients (RMCs), which exploit FLs open\nconnectivity by reconnecting to the system with modified attack strategies. To\naddress this vulnerability, we propose integration of Identity-Based\nIdentification (IBI) as a security measure within FL environments.

We\npresent a study of the properties of photometric variability of a sample of\nconfirmed mCP stars (mostly Ap/CP2 stars), mCP star candidates, and several\nnon-CP stars in the near ultraviolet and visible wavelength regions based on\nobservational data from the GALEX and Kepler prime missions. Antiphase\nvariations between the near ultraviolet and optical light curves are observed\nin the majority of mCP stars. We investigate the presence of a correlation of\nthe variability amplitudes in both wavelength regions with effective\ntemperature, surface gravity, and metallicity and calculate model atmospheres,\nspectral energy distributions and synthetic light curves to connect our\nfindings to theoretical models. While the theoretical calculations show that,\nat fixed abundances, a clear correlation between the light curve amplitude\nratios and effective temperature is expected, our sample does not show any\ncorrelation with the investigated properties. This may be due to the highly\nindividualistic abundance patterns of our sample stars, which are the main\ncontributors to the line blanketing in different wavelength bands.",

    "abstract": "We develop efficient and high-order accurate solvers for the Helmholtz\nequation on complex geometry. The schemes are based on the WaveHoltz algorithm\nwhich computes solutions of the Helmholtz equation by time-filtering solutions\nof the wave equation. The approach avoids the need to invert an indefinite\nmatrix which can cause convergence difficulties for many iterative solvers for\nindefinite Helmholtz problems. Complex geometry is treated with overset grids\nwhich use Cartesian grids throughout most of the domain together with\ncurvilinear grids near boundaries. The basic WaveHoltz fixed-point iteration is\naccelerated using GMRES and also by a deflation technique using a set of\nprecomputed eigenmodes. The solution of the wave equation is solved efficiently\nwith implicit time-stepping using as few as five time-steps per period,\nindependent of the mesh size. The time-domain solver is adjusted to remove\ndispersion errors in time and this enables the use of such large time-steps\nwithout degrading the accuracy. When multigrid is used to solve the implicit\ntime-stepping equations, the cost of the resulting WaveHoltz scheme scales\nlinearly with the total number of grid points N (at fixed frequency) and is\nthus optimal in CPU-time and memory usage as the mesh is refined. A simple\nrule-of-thumb formula is provided to estimate the number of\npoints-per-wavelength required for a p-th order accurate scheme which accounts\nfor pollution (dispersion) errors. Numerical results are given for problems in\ntwo and three space dimensions, to second and fourth-order accuracy, and they\nshow the potential of the approach to solve a wide range of large-scale\nproblems.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML)-based detectors have been shown to be effective in\ndetecting stealthy false data injection attacks (FDIAs) that can bypass\nconventional bad data detectors (BDDs) in power systems. However, ML models are\nalso vulnerable to adversarial attacks. A sophisticated perturbation signal\nadded to the original BDD-bypassing FDIA can conceal the attack from ML-based\ndetectors. In this paper, we develop a moving target defense (MTD) strategy to\ndefend against adversarial FDIAs in power grids. We first develop an\nMTD-strengthened deep neural network (DNN) model, which deploys a pool of DNN\nmodels rather than a single static model that cooperate to detect the\nadversarial attack jointly. The MTD model pool introduces randomness to the ML\nmodel's decision boundary, thereby making the adversarial attacks detectable.\nFurthermore, to increase the effectiveness of the MTD strategy and reduce the\ncomputational costs associated with developing the MTD model pool, we combine\nthis approach with the physics-based MTD, which involves dynamically perturbing\nthe transmission line reactance and retraining the DNN-based detector to adapt\nto the new system topology. Simulations conducted on IEEE test bus systems\ndemonstrate that the MTD-strengthened DNN achieves up to 94.2% accuracy in\ndetecting adversarial FDIAs. When combined with a physics-based MTD, the\ndetection accuracy surpasses 99%, while significantly reducing the\ncomputational costs of updating the DNN models.

Strong\ncoupling through interphase momentum and energy exchange generates unsteady\nwakes and shocklets in the interstitial space between particles. A Helmholtz\ndecomposition of the velocity field shows that the majority of\npseudo-turbulence is contained in the solenoidal component from particle wakes,\nwhereas the dilatational component corresponds to the downstream edge of the\nparticle curtain where the flow chokes. One-dimensional phase-averaged\nstatistics of pseudo-turbulent kinetic energy (PTKE) are quantified at various\nstages of flow development. Reduction in PTKE is observed with increasing shock\nMach number due to decreased production, consistent with single-phase\ncompressible turbulence. The anisotropy in Reynolds stresses is found to be\nrelatively constant through the curtain and consistent over all the conditions\nsimulated. Analysis of the budget of PTKE shows that the majority of turbulence\nis produced through drag and balanced by viscous dissipation. The energy\nspectra of the streamwise gas-phase velocity fluctuations reveal an inertial\nsubrange that begins at the mean interparticle spacing and decays with a power\nlaw of $-5/3$ and steepens to $-3$ at scales much smaller than the particle\ndiameter.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of defining connected components in hypergraphs, which\nare models for systems with higher-order interactions. For graphs with dyadic\ninteractions, connected components are defined in terms of paths connecting\nnodes along the graph. However, defining connected components in hypergraphs is\na more involved problem, as one needs to consider the higher-order nature of\nthe interactions associated with the hyperedge. Higher-order interactions can\nbe taken into consideration through a logic associated with the hyperedges, two\nexamples being OR-logic and AND-logic; these logical operations can be\nconsidered two limiting cases corresponding to non-cooperative and fully\ncooperative interactions, respectively. In this paper we show how connected\ncomponents can be defined in hypergraphs with OR or AND logic. While OR-logic\nand AND-logic provide the same connected components for nondirected\nhypergraphs, for directed hypergraphs the strongly connected component of\nAND-logic is a subset of the OR-logic strongly connected component.\nInterestingly, higher-order interactions change the general topological\nproperties of connected components in directed hypergraphs. Notably, while for\ndirected graphs the strongly connected component is the intersection of its in-\nand out-component, in hypergraphs with AND-logic the intersection of in- and\nout-component does not equal the strongly connected component. We develop a\ntheory for the fraction of nodes that are part of the largest connected\ncomponent and through comparison with real-world data we show that\ndegree-cardinality correlations play a significant role.",

To address this challenge, we propose a compression method by\nbuilding separate attribute codebooks and storing only discrete code indices.\nSpecifically, we employ noise-substituted vector quantization technique to\njointly train the codebooks and model features, ensuring consistency between\ngradient descent optimization and parameter discretization. Our method reduces\nthe memory consumption efficiently (around $45\\times$) while maintaining\ncompetitive reconstruction quality on standard 3D benchmark scenes.

A stronger core-block - cosolvent attractive interaction\nleads to a lower critical micelle concentration and a higher aggregation\nnumber. The density profile of cononsolvency-driven micelles is compared with\nthat of conventional micelles, which form due to core-block - solvent repulsive\ninteractions. In conventional micelles, the core is primarily occupied by\npolymer segments, whereas in cononsolvency-driven micelles, the core consists\nmainly of solvents and cosolvents. This fundamental difference can be explained\nthrough thermodynamic analysis. Conventional micelle formation is driven by the\nreduction of core-block - solvent contact due to repulsive interactions. In\ncontrast, cononsolvency-driven micelle formation is governed by an increase in\ncore-block - cosolvent contact area, playing the major role to minimize the\ntotal free energy-an essential distinction from conventional micelles.",

Hydrodynamic DFT incorporates the\ninfluence of fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interfaces into a hydrodynamic theory\nby including a thermodynamic model based on classical DFT for the chemical\npotential of inhomogeneous fluids. It simplifies to the isothermal\nNavier-Stokes equations far away from interfaces, thus connecting microscopic\nmolecular modelling and continuum fluid dynamics. In this work we use a\nHelmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed-chain statistical\nassociating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) and the viscosity is obtained from\ngeneralised entropy scaling, a one-parameter model which takes microscopic\ninformation of the fluid and solid phase into account. Deterministic\n(noise-free) density and velocity profiles reveal wetting phenomena including\ndifferent advancing and receding contact angles, the transition from\nequilibrium to steady state and the rolling motion of droplets. Compared to a\nviscosity model based on bulk values, generalised entropy scaling provides more\naccurate results, which stresses the importance of including microscopic\ninformation in the local viscosity model. Hydrodynamic DFT is transferable as\nit captures the influence of different external forces, wetting strengths and\n(molecular) solid roughness.

During market crises, IG spreads often widen and liquidity tends to\ndecrease, likely due to increased credit risk (evidenced by higher IG Credit\nDefault Index spreads) and the necessity for asset holders like mutual funds to\nliquidate assets, including IG credits, to manage margin calls, bolster cash\nreserves, or meet redemptions. These credit and liquidity premia occur during\nmarket drawdowns and tend to move non-linearly with the market. The research\nherein refers to this non-linearity (during periods of drawdown) as downside\nconvexity, and shows that this market behavior can effectively be captured\nthrough a short position established in IG Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).\n  The following document details the construction of three signals: Momentum,\nLiquidity, and Credit, that can be used in combination to signal entries and\nexits into short IG positions to hedge a typical active bond portfolio (such as\nPIMIX). A dynamic hedge initiates the short when signals jointly correlate and\npoint to significant future hedged return.

FoCal enables precise measurements of direct photon\nproduction at forward rapidity, providing a sensitive probe of the gluon\ndistribution in protons and nuclei.\n  This paper introduces the expected performance of the forward electromagnetic\ncalorimeter (FoCal-E) and presents several potential strategies for mitigating\noccupancy and BUSY violation challenges in the pixel layers of FoCal-E. Beam\ntest results demonstrate that back biasing effectively reduces pixel occupancy.\nMeanwhile, SystemC simulations explore additional mitigation strategies-such as\ngrid masking and a regional trigger-to further minimize BUSY violations and\nenhance detector performance under high-luminosity conditions.",

While\noptical spectroscopy has traditionally played a primary role in detailed\nchemical abundance studies of GCs, the increasing discovery of GCs in highly\nreddened environments underscores the need for robust NIR spectroscopic\nmethods. To evaluate the utility of high-resolution NIR spectroscopy for\nstudying multiple stellar populations, we observed six stars in M5, a\nwell-studied halo GC, using the recently commissioned IGRINS-2 spectrograph on\nthe Gemini-North telescope. Our chemical abundance measurements in the NIR\nwavelength range show good agreement with those derived from high-resolution\noptical spectroscopy, with minor systematic offsets in elements such as Na and\nMg. In addition, the measured chemical abundance ratios clearly reproduce the\ndistinctive patterns of multiple stellar populations, including the Na-O\nanti-correlation. The ability of NIR spectroscopy to measure C, N, and O\nabundances with high precision further enhances its utility for studying\nchemical properties of stars and GCs.

In this paper, we\nconsider an analogous problem on $k$-ary words involving the distribution of\nthe corresponding statistic. Note that for $k$-ary words, it suffices to\nconsider only the $r=1$ case of the aforementioned problem on permutations.\nHere, we compute for arbitrary $s$ an explicit formula for the ordinary\ngenerating function for $n \\geq 0$ of the distribution of the statistic on\n$k$-ary words $\\rho=\\rho_1\\cdots\\rho_n$ recording the number of indices $i$\nsuch that $\\rho_{i+1}-\\rho_i=s$.

We present a mean-field theoretical\napproach to analyze the binding and transport of colloids in planar polymer\nbrushes. The theory explicitly considers the effect of solvent strength on\nbrush conformation and of colloid-polymer affinity on colloid binding and\ntransport. We derive the position-dependent free energy of the colloid\ninsertion into the polymer brush which controls the rate of colloid transport\nacross the brush. We show how the properties of the brush can be adjusted for\nbrushes to be highly selective, effectively serving as tuneable gates with\nrespect to colloid size and affinity to the brush-forming polymer. The most\nimportant parameter regime simultaneously allowing for high brush permeability\nand selectivity corresponds to a condition when the repulsive and attractive\ncontributions to the colloid insertion free energy nearly cancel.

According to the literature (54 manuscripts in the last 15\nyears) prototyping in XR in XR is easier to use than three-dimensional (3D)\nmodeling with a personal computer and more capable of displaying 3D structures\nthan paper drawing. In this comprehensive review, we systematically surveyed\nthe literature on prototyping in XR and discussed the possibility of\ntransferring created virtual prototypes from XR to commonly used 3D modeling\nsoftware and reality. We proposed five research questions regarding prototyping\nin XR. They are: what the constituent elements and workflow of prototyping are;\nwhich display devices can deliver satisfying immersive and interactive\nexperiences; how user control input is obtained and what methods are available\nfor users to interact with virtual elements and create XR prototypes; what\napproaches can facilitate the connection with fabrication to ensure a smooth\ntransition from the virtual to the physical world; and what the challenges are\nand what the future holds for this research domain.

Many\nsupervised and unsupervised learning methods have been proposed recently for\nlog-based anomaly detection.

    "abstract": "Loneliness and stress are prevalent among young adults and are linked to\nsignificant psychological and health-related consequences. Social robots may\noffer a promising avenue for emotional support, especially when considering the\nongoing advancements in conversational AI. This study investigates how repeated\ninteractions with a social robot influence feelings of loneliness and perceived\nstress, and how such feelings are reflected in the themes of user disclosures\ntowards the robot. Participants engaged in a five-session robot-led\nintervention, where a large language model powered QTrobot facilitated\nstructured conversations designed to support cognitive reappraisal. Results\nfrom linear mixed-effects models show significant reductions in both loneliness\nand perceived stress over time. Additionally, semantic clustering of 560 user\ndisclosures towards the robot revealed six distinct conversational themes.\nResults from a Kruskal-Wallis H-test demonstrate that participants reporting\nhigher loneliness and stress more frequently engaged in socially focused\ndisclosures, such as friendship and connection, whereas lower distress was\nassociated with introspective and goal-oriented themes (e.g., academic\nambitions). By exploring both how the intervention affects well-being, as well\nas how well-being shapes the content of robot-directed conversations, we aim to\ncapture the dynamic nature of emotional support in huma-robot interaction.",

One can measure the statistical alignment\nbetween the inclination angles of the disk and stellar spin using the projected\nrotational velocity, radius, and rotation period of the star and\ninterferometric measurements of the protoplanetary disk. Such work is\nchallenging due to the difficulty in measuring the properties of young stars\nand biases in methods to combine them for population studies. Here, we provide\nan overview of the required observables, realistic uncertainties, and\ncomplications when using them to constrain the orientation of the system. We\nshow in several tests that we are able to constrain the uncertainties on the\nnecessary stellar parameters to better than 5% in most cases. We show that by\nusing a hierarchical Bayesian model, we can account for many of the systematic\neffects (e.g., biases in measured stellar and disk orientations) by fitting for\nthe alignments of each system simultaneously. We demonstrate our hierarchical\nmodel on a realistic synthetic sample and verify that we can recover our input\nalignment distribution to $\\leq$5$^{\\circ}$ with a modest ($\\simeq$30 star)\nsample.

Screaming channels are EM side channels transmitted\nat a distance of a few meters. They appear on mixed-signal devices integrating\nan RF module on the same silicon die as the digital part. Consequently, the\nside channels are modulated by legitimate RF signal carriers and appear at the\nharmonics of the digital clock frequency.

Large-scale condensates appear above a critical Reynolds number\n$Re_c\\approx 4.19$. Close to this onset, we find a power-law scaling of the\nenergy with $Re-Re_c$, with the energy spectrum at large scales following the\nabsolute equilibrium form proposed by Kraichnan. At larger $Re$, the energy\nspectrum deviates from this form, displaying a steep power-law range at low\nwave numbers with exponent $-5$, with most of the energy dissipation occurring\nwithin the condensate at large scales. We show that this spectral exponent is\nconsistent with the logarithmic radial vorticity profile of the condensate\nvortices predicted by quasi-linear theory for a viscously saturated condensate.\nOur findings shed new light on the classical problem of large-scale turbulent\ncondensation in forced dissipative 2D flows in finite domains, showing that the\nlarge scales are close to equilibrium dynamics in weakly turbulent flows but\nnot in the strong condensate regime with $Re\\gg1$.",

Bounds on this minimum rank\n(and on an equivalent value, the maximum nullity) are given by various graph\nparameters, most notably the zero forcing number and its variants. For a\nmatrix, replacing each nonzero entry with the symbol \\(\\ast\\) gives its\nzero-nonzero pattern. The associated minimum rank problem is to determine,\ngiven only this pattern, the smallest possible rank of the matrix. The most\nfundamental lower bound on this minimum rank is the triangle number of the\npattern. A cobipartite graph is the complement of a bipartite graph; its\nvertices can be partitioned into two cliques. Such a graph corresponds to a\nzero-nonzero pattern in a natural way. Over an infinite field, the minimum rank\nof the graph and that of the pattern obey a simple relationship. We show that\nthis same relationship is followed by the zero forcing number of the graph and\nthe triangle number of the pattern.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the localization of knowledge representation in\nfine-tuned GPT-2 models using Causal Layer Attribution via Activation Patching\n(CLAP), a method that identifies critical neural layers responsible for correct\nanswer generation. The model was fine-tuned on 9,958 PubMed abstracts\n(epilepsy: 20,595 mentions, EEG: 11,674 mentions, seizure: 13,921 mentions)\nusing two configurations with validation loss monitoring for early stopping.\nCLAP involved (1) caching clean (correct answer) and corrupted (incorrect\nanswer) activations, (2) computing logit difference to quantify model\npreference, and (3) patching corrupted activations with clean ones to assess\nrecovery. Results revealed three findings: First, patching the first\nfeedforward layer recovered 56% of correct preference, demonstrating that\nassociative knowledge is distributed across multiple layers. Second, patching\nthe final output layer completely restored accuracy (100% recovery), indicating\nthat definitional knowledge is localised. The stronger clean logit difference\nfor definitional questions further supports this localized representation.\nThird, minimal recovery from convolutional layer patching (13.6%) suggests\nlow-level features contribute marginally to high-level reasoning. Statistical\nanalysis confirmed significant layer-specific effects (p<0.01). These findings\ndemonstrate that factual knowledge is more localized and associative knowledge\ndepends on distributed representations. We also showed that editing efficacy\ndepends on task type. Our findings not only reconcile conflicting observations\nabout localization in model editing but also emphasize on using task-adaptive\ntechniques for reliable, interpretable updates.",

    "abstract": "Nondeterminism introduced by race conditions and message reorderings makes\nparallel and distributed programming hard. Nevertheless, promising approaches\nsuch as LVars and CRDTs address this problem by introducing a partial order\nstructure on shared state that describes how the state evolves over time.\nMonotone programs that respect the order are deterministic. Datalog-inspired\nlanguages incorporate this idea of monotonicity in a first-class way but they\nare not general-purpose. We would like parallel and distributed languages to be\nas natural to use as any functional language, without sacrificing expressivity,\nand with a formal basis of study as appealing as the lambda calculus.\n  This paper presents $\\lambda_\\vee$, a core language for deterministic\nparallelism that embodies the ideas above. In $\\lambda_\\vee$, values may\nincrease over time according to a streaming order and all computations are\nmonotone with respect to that order. The streaming order coincides with the\napproximation order found in Scott semantics and so unifies the foundations of\nfunctional programming with the foundations of deterministic distributed\ncomputation. The resulting lambda calculus has a computationally adequate model\nrooted in domain theory. It integrates the compositionality and power of\nabstraction characteristic of functional programming with the declarative\nnature of Datalog.\n  This version of the paper includes extended exposition and appendices with\nproofs.",

Current methods, such as function/tool\ncalling and direct code generation, suffer from limitations in expressiveness,\nscalability, cost, security, and the ability to enforce fine-grained control.\nThis paper introduces Pel, a novel programming language specifically designed\nto bridge this gap. Inspired by the strengths of Lisp, Elixir, Gleam, and\nHaskell, Pel provides a syntactically simple, homoiconic, and semantically rich\nplatform for LLMs to express complex actions, control flow, and inter-agent\ncommunication safely and efficiently. Pel's design emphasizes a minimal, easily\nmodifiable grammar suitable for constrained LLM generation, eliminating the\nneed for complex sandboxing by enabling capability control at the syntax level.\nKey features include a powerful piping mechanism for linear composition,\nfirst-class closures enabling easy partial application and functional patterns,\nbuilt-in support for natural language conditions evaluated by LLMs, and an\nadvanced Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPeL) with Common Lisp-style restarts and\nLLM-powered helper agents for automated error correction. Furthermore, Pel\nincorporates automatic parallelization of independent operations via static\ndependency analysis, crucial for performant agentic systems.

By incorporating game elements, Socratique aims to motivate students to\nprovide more feedback, while the GenAI assistant offers real-time support in\ncrafting high quality, constructive comments. To evaluate the impact of this\napproach, we conducted a randomized controlled experiment with master's\nstudents comparing a treatment group with a gamified, GenAI-driven setup\nagainst a control group with minimal gamification. Results show that students\nin the treatment group provided significantly more voluntary feedback, with\nhigher scores on clarity, relevance, and specificity - all key aspects of\neffective code and design reviews. This study provides evidence for the\neffectiveness of combining gamification and AI to improve peer review\nprocesses, with implications for fostering review-related competencies in\nsoftware engineering curricula.",

    "abstract": "In this work, Galerkin projection is used to build Reduced Order Models (ROM)\nfor two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\\'enard (RB) convection with no-slip walls. We\ncompare an uncoupled projection approach that uses separate orthonormal bases\nfor velocity and temperature with a coupled formalism where the equations are\nprojected onto a single basis combining velocity and temperature components.\nOrthonormal bases for modal projection are obtained as the eigenvalues of the\ncontrollability Gramian of the linearized RB equations. Various coupled and\nuncoupled ROMs with different number of modes are generated and validated\nagainst Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) over a wide range of Rayleigh\nnumbers, $Ra$. DNS and ROM results are compared in terms of mean vertical\nprofiles, heat flux, flow structures, bifurcation diagrams and energy spectra.\nCoupled ROMs are found to be unstable at high $Ra$ numbers with a stability\nlimit that depends on the basis $Ra$. Uncoupled models show an increasing\nagreement with DNS as a function of the system dimension. It is found that for\nthe system truncations investigated here, a quantitative agreement with DNS can\nbe obtained up to $Ra\\simeq 4\\times 10^5$. ROMs are used to perform a\nbifurcation analysis for $Pr=10$ and the results compared to DNS. They\nqualitatively predict the transitions between periodic, quasiperiodic and\nchaotic states as well as the spectral characteristics over a wide range of\n$Ra$ numbers. Overall, these results show that these ROMs reproduce the main\nflow features of RB convection and could be used as DNS-surrogates for the\ndevelopment of active control strategies and state estimation applications.",

    "abstract": "A relevant question when analyzing spatial point patterns is that of spatial\nrandomness. More specifically, before any model can be fit to a point pattern a\nfirst step is to test the data for departures from complete spatial randomness\n(CSR). Traditional techniques employ distance or quadrat counts based methods\nto test for CSR based on batched data. In this paper, we consider the practical\nscenario of testing for CSR when the data are available sequentially (i.e.,\nonline). We present a sequential testing methodology called as {\\em\nPRe-process} that is based on e-values and is a fast, efficient and\nnonparametric method. Simulation experiments with the truth departing from CSR\nin two different scenarios show that the method is effective in capturing\ninhomogeneity over time. Two real data illustrations considering lung cancer\ncases in the Chorley-Ribble area, England from 1974 - 1983 and locations of\nearthquakes in the state of Oklahoma, USA from 2000 - 2011 demonstrate the\nutility of the PRe-process in sequential testing of CSR.",

Pairwise learning is ubiquitous, and it covers\nseveral popular learning tasks such as ranking, metric learning and AUC\nmaximization. A notable difference of pairwise learning from pointwise learning\nis the statistical dependencies among input pairs, for which existing analyses\nhave not been able to handle in the general setting considered in this paper.\nTo this end, we extend recent results that blend together two\nalgorithm-dependent frameworks of analysis -- algorithmic stability and\nPAC-Bayes -- which allow us to deal with any data-adaptive sampling scheme in\nthe optimizer. We instantiate this framework to analyze (1) pairwise stochastic\ngradient descent, which is a default workhorse in many machine learning\nproblems, and (2) pairwise stochastic gradient descent ascent, which is a\nmethod used in adversarial training. All of these algorithms make use of a\nstochastic sampling from a discrete distribution (sample indices) before each\nupdate. Non-uniform sampling of these indices has been already suggested in the\nrecent literature, to which our work provides generalization guarantees in both\nsmooth and non-smooth convex problems.",

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), capable of reasoning through complex problems,\nhave become crucial for tasks like programming, mathematics, and commonsense\nreasoning. However, a key challenge lies in understanding how these models\nacquire reasoning capabilities and exhibit \"aha moments\" when they reorganize\ntheir methods to allocate more thinking time to problems. In this work, we\nsystematically study \"aha moments\" in LRMs, from linguistic patterns,\ndescription of uncertainty, \"Reasoning Collapse\" to analysis in latent space.\nWe demonstrate that the \"aha moment\" is externally manifested in a more\nfrequent use of anthropomorphic tones for self-reflection and an adaptive\nadjustment of uncertainty based on problem difficulty. This process helps the\nmodel complete reasoning without succumbing to \"Reasoning Collapse\".\nInternally, it corresponds to a separation between anthropomorphic\ncharacteristics and pure reasoning, with an increased anthropomorphic tone for\nmore difficult problems. Furthermore, we find that the \"aha moment\" helps\nmodels solve complex problems by altering their perception of problem\ndifficulty. As the layer of the model increases, simpler problems tend to be\nperceived as more complex, while more difficult problems appear simpler.",

The\nresults are compared to recent theory calculations that include, in addition to\nthermal radiation from the quark-gluon plasma and hadron gas, sources of\nphotons from pre-equilibrium, strong magnetic fields, or radiative\nhadronization. While the newer theoretical calculations describe the data\nbetter than previous models, none of them alone can fully explain the results,\nparticularly in the region of $p_T=4$--8 GeV/$c$.",

    "abstract": "Spectral degeneracies in Liouvillian generators of dissipative dynamics\ngenerically occur as exceptional points, where the corresponding non-Hermitian\noperator becomes non-diagonalizable. Steady states, i.e. zero-modes of\nLiouvillians, are considered a fundamental exception to this rule since a no-go\ntheorem excludes non-diagonalizable degeneracies there. Here, we demonstrate\nthat the crucial issue of diverging timescales in dissipative state preparation\nis largely tantamount to an asymptotic approach towards the forbidden scenario\nof an exceptional steady state in the thermodynamic limit. With case studies\nranging from NP-complete satisfiability problems encoded in a quantum master\nequation to the dissipative preparation of a symmetry protected topological\nphase, we reveal the close relation between the computational complexity of the\nproblem at hand, and the finite size scaling towards the exceptional steady\nstate, exemplifying both exponential and polynomial scaling. Formally treating\nthe weight $W$ of quantum jumps in the Lindblad master equation as a parameter,\nwe show that exceptional steady states at the physical value $W=1$ may be\nunderstood as a critical point hallmarking the onset of dynamical instability.",

While previous research has\nfocused primarily on fault-tolerant quantum memories, we extend this\ninvestigation to magic state injection--a critical yet resource-intensive\ncomponent of fault-tolerant quantum computation. We show that, after\npostselecting on erasures, the logical error rate of the injected magic state\nis set by the residual Pauli error, while the space-time overhead is only\nmarginally increased as compared to non-erasure qubits with a similar noise\nstrength. These conclusions hold both for injection into the surface code, and\nfor injection and cultivation on the color code. For the former, we show that\nmost of the gains can be achieved by using just three strategically placed\nerasure qubits in the surface code patch, independent of the patch size. For\nthe latter, in contrast, it is beneficial to have all the qubits in the\ncultivation patch be erasure qubits.

Using integral field spectroscopic data\nfrom the SDSS-IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA)\nsurvey, we identified a sample of 120 CR disk galaxies by inspecting their\nkinematic maps and analyzing the shape of the stellar line-of-sight velocity\ndistribution (LOSVD), which was recovered non-parametrically.

We show that the observed\nkinematic bimodality -- where the CR disk is either concentrated in the central\nregion (inner~CR) or dominates the outer part of the galaxy (outer~CR) -- is\ndriven by differences in the stellar mass and angular momentum of the CR disk.\nThe wide range of stellar metallicities observed in CR disks suggests that no\nsingle source of external material is solely responsible for CR formation in\nall galaxies; instead, proposed mechanisms such as merger with gas-rich\nsatellites, accretion from cosmic filaments, and exchange of gas between\nneighboring galaxies can dominate in individual cases.",

However, previous studies\nhave reported widely varying dependencies of merger timescales on initial\norbital parameters and mass ratio at the first crossing of $r_{\\rm vir}$. Using\nIllustrisTNG simulations, we find that these dependencies vary with host halo\nmass, suggesting that discrepancies in prior studies may arise from differences\nin the systems analyzed. Specifically, in low-mass halos, merger timescales\nshow a stronger dependence on initial orbital parameters, while in high-mass\nhalos, this dependence weakens. To account for these variations, we present a\nfitting formula that incorporates host mass dependence, achieving a logarithmic\nscatter smaller than 0.15 dex. Comparing dark matter-only and baryonic\nsimulations, we observe similar merger timescales for circular orbits but\nnotable differences for radial orbits. In halos with $M_{\\rm{host}} < 10^{12.5}\nh^{-1} M_{\\odot}$, mergers in dark matter-only runs take longer than in\nbaryonic runs, whereas the trend reverses in more massive halos. We attribute\nthese differences to the competing effects of tidal disruption by central\ngalaxy disks and the resistance of baryonic satellites to tidal stripping.\nFinally, we extend our model to predict merger timescales from any starting\nradius within the halo. By fitting the extended model to the entire infall\nsample, we find that using only the merger sample can underestimate merger\ntimescales, particularly for low mass ratios. Our model provides a valuable\ntool for improving semi-analytical and empirical models of galaxy formation.",

Each\nlensed quasar was typically monitored for one to four seasons, often shared\nbetween the two telescopes to mitigate the interruptions forced by the COVID-19\npandemic. The sample of targets consists of 19 quadruply and 3 doubly imaged\nquasars, which received a total of 1 918 hours of on-sky time split into 21 581\nwide-field frames, each 320 seconds long. In a given field, the 5-{\\sigma}\ndepth of the combined exposures typically reaches the 27th magnitude, while\nthat of single visits is 24.5 mag - similar to the expected depth of the\nupcoming Vera-Rubin LSST. The fluxes of the different lensed images of the\ntargets were reliably de-blended, providing not only light curves with\nphotometric precision down to the photon noise limit, but also high-resolution\nmodels of the targets whose features and astrometry were systematically\nconfirmed in Hubble Space Telescope imaging. This was made possible thanks to a\nnew photometric pipeline, lightcurver, and the forward modelling method\nSTARRED. Finally, the time delays between pairs of curves and their\nuncertainties were estimated, taking into account the degeneracy due to\nmicrolensing, and for the first time the full covariance matrices of the delay\npairs are provided. Of note, this survey, with 13 square degrees, has\napplications beyond that of time delays, such as the study of the structure\nfunction of the multiple high-redshift quasars present in the footprint at a\nnew high in terms of both depth and frequency.

Existing editing\nmethods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an\nedit direction in the text embedding or score space. However, such a procedure\nfaces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual\nconsistency while underestimating it fails the editing task. Notably, each\nsource image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to\nsearch for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play\nframework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image\nediting. At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text\nembedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the\nrepresentations of the collected visual concepts. This allows us to accurately\nestimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit. Based\non the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept\ntransplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction. To\nsufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation\ndataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of\nvisual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary.

This\narticle suggests a surprisingly positive answer to the question $-$ namely,\nthat the process may proceed in electron-positron collisions at accelerator\nenergies, occurring as $e^+e^-\\rightarrow W^-\\rho(770)^+$. Although the\nresonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent,\nquite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of $\\rho^+$ from the\ninitial state converts the incident $e^+$ into $\\bar\\nu_e$.

For a\ngeneral class of composite testing problems -- which include bounded mean\ntesting, equal mean testing for bounded random tuples, and some key ingredients\nof two-sample and independence testing as special cases -- we show that any\n$e$-process satisfying a certain sublinear regret bound is adaptively,\nasymptotically, and almost surely log-optimal for a composite alternative. This\nis a strong notion of optimality that has not previously been established for\nthe aforementioned problems and we provide explicit test supermartingales and\n$e$-processes satisfying this notion in the more general case. Furthermore, we\nderive matching lower and upper bounds on the expected rejection time for the\nresulting sequential tests in all of these cases. The proofs of these results\nmake weak, algorithm-agnostic moment assumptions and rely on a general-purpose\nproof technique involving the aforementioned regret and a family of numeraire\nportfolios. Finally, we discuss how all of these theorems hold in a\ndistribution-uniform sense, a notion of log-optimality that is stronger still\nand seems to be new to the literature.",

However, existing methods encode all shapes into\na fixed-size token, disregarding the inherent variations in scale and\ncomplexity across 3D data. This leads to inefficient latent representations\nthat can compromise downstream generation. We address this challenge by\nintroducing Octree-based Adaptive Tokenization, a novel framework that adjusts\nthe dimension of latent representations according to shape complexity. Our\napproach constructs an adaptive octree structure guided by a\nquadric-error-based subdivision criterion and allocates a shape latent vector\nto each octree cell using a query-based transformer. Building upon this\ntokenization, we develop an octree-based autoregressive generative model that\neffectively leverages these variable-sized representations in shape generation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces token counts by 50%\ncompared to fixed-size methods while maintaining comparable visual quality.\nWhen using a similar token length, our method produces significantly\nhigher-quality shapes. When incorporated with our downstream generative model,\nour method creates more detailed and diverse 3D content than existing\napproaches.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the Markovian iteration method for solving\ncoupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) featuring a\nfully coupled forward drift, meaning the drift term explicitly depends on both\nthe forward and backward processes. An FBSDE system typically involves three\nstochastic processes: the forward process $X$, the backward process $Y$\nrepresenting the solution, and the $Z$ process corresponding to the scaled\nderivative of $Y$. Prior research by Bender and Zhang (2008) has established\nconvergence results for iterative schemes dealing with $Y$-coupled FBSDEs.\nHowever, extending these results to equations with $Z$ coupling poses\nsignificant challenges, especially in uniformly controlling the Lipschitz\nconstant of the decoupling fields across iterations and time steps within a\nfixed-point framework.\n  To overcome this issue, we propose a novel differentiation-based method for\nhandling the $Z$ process. This approach enables improved management of the\nLipschitz continuity of decoupling fields, facilitating the well-posedness of\nthe discretized FBSDE system with fully coupled drift. We rigorously prove the\nconvergence of our Markovian iteration method in this more complex setting.\nFinally, numerical experiments confirm our theoretical insights, showcasing the\neffectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methodology.",

In 2024,\nour goal was to transition BOP from lab-like setups to real-world scenarios.\nFirst, we introduced new model-free tasks, where no 3D object models are\navailable and methods need to onboard objects just from provided reference\nvideos. Second, we defined a new, more practical 6D object detection task where\nidentities of objects visible in a test image are not provided as input. Third,\nwe introduced new BOP-H3 datasets recorded with high-resolution sensors and\nAR/VR headsets, closely resembling real-world scenarios. BOP-H3 include 3D\nmodels and onboarding videos to support both model-based and model-free tasks.\nParticipants competed on seven challenge tracks. Notably, the best 2024 method\nfor model-based 6D localization of unseen objects (FreeZeV2.1) achieves 22%\nhigher accuracy on BOP-Classic-Core than the best 2023 method (GenFlow), and is\nonly 4% behind the best 2023 method for seen objects (GPose2023) although being\nsignificantly slower (24.9 vs 2.7s per image). A more practical 2024 method for\nthis task is Co-op which takes only 0.8s per image and is 13% more accurate\nthan GenFlow. Methods have similar rankings on 6D detection as on 6D\nlocalization but higher run time. On model-based 2D detection of unseen\nobjects, the best 2024 method (MUSE) achieves 21--29% relative improvement\ncompared to the best 2023 method (CNOS). However, the 2D detection accuracy for\nunseen objects is still -35% behind the accuracy for seen objects (GDet2023),\nand the 2D detection stage is consequently the main bottleneck of existing\npipelines for 6D localization/detection of unseen objects.

Load management and demand response measures promise to\nadjust for this mismatch, utilizing information- and price-based approaches to\nsteer demand towards times with high supply of intermittent renewables. Here,\nwe systematically review the literature estimating CO$_2$ savings from\nresidential load management in developing and developed nations.

Most identified studies suggest\na mitigation potential between 1 and 20%. Load management becomes more relevant\nwith higher shares of intermittent renewables, and when electricity prices are\nhigh. Importantly, load management aligns consumers' financial incentives with\nclimate change mitigation, thus rendering accompanying strategies politically\nfeasible.

To estimate RNE and RNI we need hemodynamic response in the brain\nand the performance score of a task.We collected oxygenated hemoglobin ($\\Delta\n\\mathrm{HbO}$). Sixteen participants answered 16 questions in a unity-based\neducational game, each with a 30-second response time. We used deep learning\nmodels to predict the performance score and estimate RNE and RNI to understand\nCE. The study compares traditional machine learning techniques with deep\nlearning models such as CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and a hybrid CNN-GRU to determine\nwhich approach provides better accuracy in predicting performance scores. The\nresult shows that the hybrid CNN-GRU gives better performance with 78.36\\%\ntraining accuracy and 73.08\\% test accuracy than other models. We performed\nXGBoost on the extracted GRU feature and got the highest accuracy (69.23\\%).\nThis suggests that the features learned from this hybrid model generalize\nbetter even in traditional machine learning algorithms.

In this work, we\ndemonstrate that a formulation of quantum theory based solely on real numbers\nis indeed possible while retaining key features such as theory-representation\nlocality (i.e. local physical operations are represented by local changes to\nthe states) and the positive semi-definiteness of its states and effects. We\nobserve that the standard system combination rule--the tensor product--was\nderived after the development of single-system complex quantum theory. By\nstarting from a single-system quantum theory using only real numbers, we derive\na combination rule that produces a real quantum theory with properties\nanalogous to those of conventional complex quantum theory. We also prove that\nthe conventional tensor product rule can also lead to a real and\nrepresentation-local theory, albeit with a modified characterization of the\nstate space.

A limitation of this statement is that it does not give an\nexpression in terms of $n$ and $r$. A widely used version of Tur\\'{a}n's\ntheorem states that for an $n$-vertex $K_{r+1}$-free graph, $m \\leq\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2(r-1)}{2r} \\right\\rfloor.$ Though this bound is often\nmore convenient, it is not the same as the original statement. In particular,\nthe class of extremal graphs for this bound, say $\\mathcal{S}$, is a proper\nsubset of the set of Tur\\'{a}n graphs. In this paper, we generalize this result\nas follows: For each $v \\in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the order of the largest\nclique that contains $v$. We show that \\[ m \\leq\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\sum_{v\\in V(G)}\\frac{c(v)-1}{c(v)}\\right\\rfloor\\]\nFurthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality\nin this bound.

Using recent\n6-dimensional phase space measurements for both galaxies, we use backward\nintegration to revisit M33's orbital history in a massive M31 potential\n($3\\times10^{12}\\,M_{\\odot}$) for the first time. As previously concluded, we\nfind that a first infall orbit is still the most statistically significant\n($\\gtrsim$ 90%) orbital solution for M33, except for a high mass M31 combined\nwith M31 proper motions from HST (as opposed to Gaia), where there is a greater\nlikelihood (~65%) of a previous encounter. However, the minimum distance\nbetween M33 and M31 during this passage is typically $\\geq$ 100 kpc, two to\nthree times larger than the distance required to explain M33's warped stellar\nand gaseous disks. We quantify the magnitude and direction of M31's evolving\nCOM position ($R_{COM}$) and velocity ($V_{COM}$) owing to M33, finding\n$R_{COM}\\approx$100-150 kpc at maximum and $V_{COM}\\approx$20-40 km s$^{-1}$.\nFurthermore, we explore the implications of this phenomenon for the M31\nsatellite system, specifically whether M33's gravitational influence is linked\nto the lopsided distribution of M31 satellites and whether M33 significantly\nperturbs the orbits of other M31 satellites. While M33 alone may not explain\nthe lopsided nature of M31's satellite system, its dynamical impact is\nnon-negligible and must be accounted for in future dynamical studies of the M31\nsystem.",

Many behaviors of interest are\nintroduced during fine-tuning, and model diffing offers a promising lens to\ninterpret such behaviors. Crosscoders are a recent model diffing method that\nlearns a shared dictionary of interpretable concepts represented as latent\ndirections in both the base and fine-tuned models, allowing us to track how\nconcepts shift or emerge during fine-tuning. Notably, prior work has observed\nconcepts with no direction in the base model, and it was hypothesized that\nthese model-specific latents were concepts introduced during fine-tuning.\nHowever, we identify two issues which stem from the crosscoders L1 training\nloss that can misattribute concepts as unique to the fine-tuned model, when\nthey really exist in both models. We develop Latent Scaling to flag these\nissues by more accurately measuring each latent's presence across models. In\nexperiments comparing Gemma 2 2B base and chat models, we observe that the\nstandard crosscoder suffers heavily from these issues. Building on these\ninsights, we train a crosscoder with BatchTopK loss and show that it\nsubstantially mitigates these issues, finding more genuinely chat-specific and\nhighly interpretable concepts. We recommend practitioners adopt similar\ntechniques. Using the BatchTopK crosscoder, we successfully identify a set of\nchat-specific latents that are both interpretable and causally effective,\nrepresenting concepts such as $\\textit{false information}$ and\n$\\textit{personal question}$, along with multiple refusal-related latents that\nshow nuanced preferences for different refusal triggers. Overall, our work\nadvances best practices for the crosscoder-based methodology for model diffing\nand demonstrates that it can provide concrete insights into how chat-tuning\nmodifies model behavior.",

However, collecting large thermal datasets is costly\nand labor-intensive due to the specialized equipment required for infrared\nimage capture. To address this challenge, researchers have explored\nvisible-to-thermal image translation. Most existing methods rely on Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) or Diffusion Models (DMs), treating the task as a\nstyle transfer problem. As a result, these approaches attempt to learn both the\nmodality distribution shift and underlying physical principles from limited\ntraining data.

This allows the model to learn meaningful\ncorrelations between scene objects and their thermal signatures in infrared\nimagery. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that F-ViTA\noutperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

We\nintroduce a framework that addresses this gap through a layer-wise abstraction\nof innovations aimed at meeting users' requirements with large models. Through\nmultiple case studies, we illustrate how researchers and practitioners across\nvarious fields can operationalize this framework. Beyond modularizing the\npipeline of transforming large models into useful \"vertical systems\", we also\nhighlight the dynamism that exists within different layers of the framework.\nFinally, we discuss how our framework can guide researchers and practitioners\nto (i) optimally situate their innovations (e.g., when vertical-specific\ninsights can empower broadly impactful vertical-agnostic innovations), (ii)\nuncover overlooked opportunities (e.g., spotting recurring problems across\nverticals to develop practically useful foundation models instead of chasing\nbenchmarks), and (iii) facilitate cross-disciplinary communication of critical\nchallenges (e.g., enabling a shared vocabulary for AI developers, domain\nexperts, and human-computer interaction scholars).",

    "abstract": "Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building\ngeneralist robots. However, scaling imitation learning for large robot\nfoundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality\nexpert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide\nrange of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data\nprovides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and\nagent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation\nlearning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation.\nIn this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows\nfor leveraging both video and action data for policy learning. Specifically, a\nUWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within\na unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps\ngovern each modality. By controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly\nrepresent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video\ngenerator. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM\nenables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both\ndynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust\npolicies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from\naction-free video data through independent control of modality-specific\ndiffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies.\nOur results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large,\nheterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple\nunification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and\nworld modeling.

The source had a relatively\nstable flux level during previous NuSTAR observations, but the flux varied\nsignificantly during the current one. The light curve exhibits dips (off-state)\nand flares (on-state). The phase-coherent timing analysis during the on-state\nyields a pulse period of $443.99(4)~\\mathrm{s}$, showing the pulsar's continued\nspin-down. The pulse profiles show an asymmetric double-peaked structure with a\nphase separation of 0.47 between the two peaks. A cyclotron resonance\nscattering feature (CRSF) is also detected at $\\sim 17.6~\\mathrm{keV}$, along\nwith its harmonic at $\\sim 38~\\mathrm{keV}$, persisting across all flux states.\nFlux-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the CRSF remains constant despite a\n25-fold change in flux. The spectral parameters like photon index and e-fold\nenergy are out of phase with the pulse shape, whereas cutoff energy is in phase\nwith the pulse shape. The source's luminosity during the on-state is $2.85\n\\times 10^{35}~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$, consistent with a \"pencil\" beam radiation\npattern expected at this flux level from a collisionless gas-mediated shock.\nThese results offer further insights into the accretion dynamics and magnetic\nfield geometry of this system.",

Here we present a\nnew homogeneous survey of 41 VLT/FLAMES multi-fibre spectroscopic pointings\nthat contain 2108 individual spectra, and combined with Gaia DR3 photometry and\nastrometry we present v-los measurements for 333 individual Red Giant Branch\nstars that are consistent with membership in the Sextans dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxy. In addition, we provide the metallicity, [Fe/H], determined from the\ntwo strongest CaII triplet lines, for 312 of these stars. We look again at the\nglobal characteristics of Sextans, deriving a mean line-of-sight velocity of\n<v-los> = +227.1km/s and a mean metallicity of <[Fe/H]> = -2.37. The\nmetallicity distribution is clearly double peaked, with the highest peak at\n[Fe/H]= -2.81 and another broader peak at [Fe/H]= -2.09. Thus it appears that\nSextans hosts two populations and the superposition leads to a radial variation\nin the mean metallicity, with the more metal rich population being centrally\nconcentrated. In addition there is an intriguing group of 9 probable members in\nthe outer region of Sextans at higher [Fe/H] than the mean in this region. If\nthis group could be confirmed as members they would eliminate the metallicity\ngradient. We also look again at the Colour-Magnitude Diagram of the resolved\nstellar population in Sextans. We also look again at the relation between\nSextans and the intriguingly nearby globular cluster, Pal3. The global\nproperties of Sextans have not changed significantly compared to previous\nstudies, but they are now more precise, and the sample of known members in the\nouter regions is now more complete.",

    "abstract": "How many copies of a mixed state $\\rho \\in \\mathbb{C}^{d \\times d}$ are\nneeded to learn its spectrum? To date, the best known algorithms for spectrum\nestimation require as many copies as full state tomography, suggesting the\npossibility that learning a state's spectrum might be as difficult as learning\nthe entire state. We show that this is not the case in the setting of\nunentangled measurements, by giving a spectrum estimation algorithm that uses\n$n = O(d^3\\cdot (\\log\\log(d) / \\log(d))^4 )$ copies of $\\rho$, which is\nasymptotically fewer than the $n = \\Omega(d^3)$ copies necessary for full state\ntomography. Our algorithm is inspired by the technique of local moment matching\nfrom classical statistics, and shows how it can be applied in the quantum\nsetting.\n  As an important subroutine in our spectrum estimation algorithm, we give an\nestimator of the $k$-th moment $\\operatorname{tr}(\\rho^k)$ which performs\nunentangled measurements and uses $O(d^{3-2/k})$ copies of $\\rho$ in order to\nachieve a constant multiplicative error. This directly translates to an\nadditive-error estimator of quantum Renyi entropy of order $k$ with the same\nnumber of copies.\n  Finally, we present numerical evidence that the sample complexity of spectrum\nestimation can only improve over full state tomography by a sub-polynomial\nfactor. Specifically, for spectrum learning with fully entangled measurements,\nwe run simulations which suggest a lower bound of $\\Omega(d^{2 - \\gamma})$\ncopies for any constant $\\gamma > 0$. From this, we conclude the current best\nlower bound of $\\Omega(d)$ is likely not tight.",

    "abstract": "Human activity recognition is increasingly vital for supporting independent\nliving, particularly for the elderly and those in need of assistance. Domestic\nservice robots with monitoring capabilities can enhance safety and provide\nessential support. Although image-based methods have advanced considerably in\nthe past decade, their adoption remains limited by concerns over privacy and\nsensitivity to low-light or dark conditions. As an alternative, millimetre-wave\n(mmWave) radar can produce point cloud data which is privacy-preserving.\nHowever, processing the sparse and noisy point clouds remains a long-standing\nchallenge. While graph-based methods and attention mechanisms show promise,\nthey predominantly rely on \"fixed\" kernels; kernels that are applied uniformly\nacross all neighbourhoods, highlighting the need for adaptive approaches that\ncan dynamically adjust their kernels to the specific geometry of each local\nneighbourhood in point cloud data. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an\nadaptive approach within the graph convolutional framework. Instead of a single\nshared weight function, our Multi-Head Adaptive Kernel (MAK) module generates\nmultiple dynamic kernels, each capturing different aspects of the local feature\nspace. By progressively refining local features while maintaining global\nspatial context, our method enables convolution kernels to adapt to varying\nlocal features. Experimental results on benchmark datasets confirm the\neffectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in human\nactivity recognition.

These bounds are sharp up\nto principal exponential order for all $u$ in dimension three and all $u \\neq\nu_\\ast$ in higher dimensions, where $u_*$ refers to the critical parameter of\nthe model, and they match the upper bounds derived in the article\narXiv:2503.14497. In dimension three, our results further imply that the\ntruncated two-point function grows at large distances $x$ at a rate that\ndepends on $x$ only through its Euclidean norm, which offers a glimpse of the\nexpected (Euclidean) invariance of the scaling limit at criticality. The rate\nfunction is atypical, it incurs a logarithmic correction and comes with an\nexplicit pre-factor that converges to $0$ as the parameter $u$ approaches the\ncritical point $u_*$ from either side. A particular challenge stems from the\ncombined effects of lack of monotonicity due to the truncation in the\nsuper-critical phase, and the precise (rotationally invariant) controls we\nseek, that measure the effects of a certain \"harmonic humpback\" function. Among\nothers, their derivation relies on rather fine estimates for hitting\nprobabilities of the random walk in arbitrary direction $e$, which witness this\ninvariance at the discrete level, and preclude straightforward applications of\nprojection arguments.",

Sustained,\nnon-disruptive operation is achieved at densities up to 1.8 times the Greenwald\nlimit ($n_\\mathrm{G}$) until the termination of auxiliary heating. Systematic\npower scans reveal distinct power scalings for the core ($n_e \\propto\nP_\\mathrm{SOL}^{0.27\\pm0.03}$) and edge ($n_e \\propto\nP_\\mathrm{SOL}^{0.42\\pm0.04}$) density limits. The edge density saturation is\ntriggered abruptly by the onset of a non-disruptive, high-field side radiative\ninstability that clamps the edge density below $n_\\mathrm{G}$. In contrast, the\ncore density continues to rise until it saturates, a state characterized by\nsubstantially enhanced core turbulence. Core transport evolves from a diffusive\nto an intermittent, avalanche-like state, as indicated by heavy-tailed\nprobability density functions (kurtosis $\\approx 6$), elevated Hurst exponents,\nand a $1/f$-type power spectrum.

Recent work proposed,\nstudied, and implemented a robust and practical information-theoretic\ncardinality estimation framework. In this framework, the estimator is the\ncardinality upper bound of a conjunctive query subject to\n``degree-constraints'', which model a rich set of input data statistics. For\ngeneral degree constraints, computing this bound is computationally hard.\nResearchers have naturally sought efficiently computable relaxed upper bounds\nthat are as tight as possible. The polymatroid bound is the tightest among\nthose relaxed upper bounds. While it is an open question whether the\npolymatroid bound can be computed in polynomial-time in general, it is known to\nbe computable in polynomial-time for some classes of degree constraints.\n  Our focus is on a common class of degree constraints called simple degree\nconstraints. Researchers had not previously determined how to compute the\npolymatroid bound in polynomial time for this class of constraints. Our first\nmain result is a polynomial time algorithm to compute the polymatroid bound\ngiven simple degree constraints. Our second main result is a polynomial-time\nalgorithm to compute a ``proof sequence'' establishing this bound. This proof\nsequence can then be incorporated in the PANDA-framework to give a faster\nalgorithm to evaluate a conjunctive query. In addition, we show computational\nlimitations to extending our results to broader classes of degree constraints.\nFinally, our technique leads naturally to a new relaxed upper bound called the\n{\\em flow bound}, which is computationally tractable.",

However, for latent features with the perception\nfield that spans both known and unknown regions, such latent-level momentum\nrestricts the generative ability of video diffusion in unknown regions.\nTherefore, we further introduce the aforementioned consistent video as a\npixel-level momentum to a directly generated video without momentum for better\nrecovery of unseen regions. Our cascaded momentum enables video diffusion\nmodels to generate both high-fidelity and consistent novel views. We further\nfinetune the global Gaussian representations with enhanced frames and render\nnew frames for momentum update in the next step. In this manner, we can\niteratively recover a 3D scene, avoiding the limitation of video length.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the generalization capability and superior\nperformance of our method in high-fidelity and consistent scene generation.",

    "abstract": "Point cloud processing poses two fundamental challenges: establishing\nconsistent point ordering and effectively learning fine-grained geometric\nfeatures. Current architectures rely on complex operations that limit\nexpressivity while struggling to capture detailed surface geometry. We present\nCanonNet, a lightweight neural network composed of two complementary\ncomponents: (1) a preprocessing pipeline that creates a canonical point\nordering and orientation, and (2) a geometric learning framework where networks\nlearn from synthetic surfaces with precise curvature values. This modular\napproach eliminates the need for complex transformation-invariant architectures\nwhile effectively capturing local geometric properties. Our experiments\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance in curvature estimation and\ncompetitive results in geometric descriptor tasks with significantly fewer\nparameters (\\textbf{100X}) than comparable methods. CanonNet's efficiency makes\nit particularly suitable for real-world applications where computational\nresources are limited, demonstrating that mathematical preprocessing can\neffectively complement neural architectures for point cloud analysis.

Using ALMA\nobservations of CO(2-1), CO(3-2), and CO(6-5) transitions at roughly 0.1\narcseconds (approximately 7 parsecs) resolution, we analyzed the temperature,\ndensity, and kinematics of NGC 1068's circumnuclear disk (CND), focusing on the\nmolecular outflow. Through local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis, we\nderived column densities and rotational temperatures, indicating optically thin\ngas and CO-to-H2 (XCO) conversion factors between 4.8 and 9.6 times smaller\nthan the Milky Way value. The inferred molecular mass outflow rate is mostly\nbelow 5.5 solar masses per year, with the dominant contribution northeast of\nthe AGN. After subtracting the rotation curve of the CND, we modeled averaged\nline profiles in each region using single and multi-component Gaussian fits.\nSeveral profiles within or near the AGN wind bicone required multiple\ncomponents with significant velocity shifts, suggesting multi-component complex\noutflow kinematics. We observe lateral variation in CO kinematics along the AGN\nwind bicone and a misalignment between the molecular and ionized outflow\ndirections. These results imply that the dynamic impact of the ionized AGN wind\non the molecular gas in the CND may be limited. However, the molecular outflow\nshows a complex, asymmetric structure.",

Traditionally, observable\nconnections, such as phone calls, financial transactions, or social media\nconnections, have been used to infer coordination and connectivity. However,\nincomplete, encrypted, or fragmented data, alongside the ubiquity of\ncommunication platforms and deliberate obfuscation, often leave many real-world\nconnections hidden. In this study, we demonstrate that coordinating individuals\nexhibit shared bursty activity patterns, enabling their detection even when\nobservable links between them are sparse or entirely absent.

This configuration generically\nrepresents industrial processes where acoustic forcing offers a contactless\nmeans of stirring or controlling confined flows. Successfully doing so,\nhowever, requires sufficient insight into the topology of the acoustically\nforced flow. This raises the question of whether the base acoustic streaming\njet is stable and, when not, of which alternative states emerge. Using Linear\nStability Analysis (LSA) and three-dimensional nonlinear simulations, we\nidentify the instability mechanisms and determine the nature of the\nbifurcations that ensue. We show that the ratio $C_R$ between the cavity and\nthe maximum beam radii determines the dominant unstable mode. For $4 \\leq C_R\n\\leq 6$, a non-oscillatory perturbation rooted in the jet impingement triggers\na supercritical bifurcation. For $C_R = 3$, the flow destabilises through a\nsubcritical non-oscillatory bifurcation. Further reducing $C_R$ increases the\nshear within the flow, and gradually relocates the instability in the shear\nlayer between impingement-induced vortices: for $C_R = 2$, an unstable\ntravelling wave grows out of a subcritical bifurcation, which becomes\nsupercritical for $C_R=1$. For each geometry, the nonlinear 3D simulations\nvalidate the LSA, identify the saturated nonlinear state and its stability.\nThis study offers fundamental insight into the stability of acoustically-driven\nflows in general, but also opens possible pathways to either induce turbulence\nacoustically, or to avoid it in realistic configurations.",

Given the complex structure of dwarf galaxies, we\nused four different methods to derive SP radial profiles: two based on\nconcentric elliptical rings, and two exploiting the spatially resolved data.\nFor each method, we applied four approaches to calculate the inner ($0 \\leq\nR/R_e \\leq 1$) and outer ($0.75 \\leq R/R_e \\leq 1.5$) gradients of: luminosity-\nand mass-weighted age and stellar metallicity, dust attenuation, $D_{n4000}$\nindex, stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) surface densities, and\nspecific SFR. While the PSF has a minor impact on the SP gradients, the\nmethodology for characterizing radial profiles significantly affects them. At\nfixed property, differences in inner gradients from concentric rings methods\nare $\\sim0.05\\text{-}0.1 \\text{ dex/}R_e$, while outer gradients can reach\n$0.5\\text{-}1 \\text{ dex/}R_e$, relative to the median of all gradients of that\nproperty, $\\text{med}\\left(\\{\\nabla \\mathcal{G}\\}_i\\right)$.

The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting\n(SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. We show that\nthe LC order fundamentally changes the pairing instability and the SC state,\nleading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton\nsuperconductor. In the single-orbital model on the kagome lattice, the LC-CDW\nstate is a Chern metal near van Hove filling with a partially filled Chern band\nhosting 3 Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the\nCFPs generates 3 SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings induced\nby the TRS breaking LC. Due to the discrete quantum geometry associated with\nthe 3-fold rotation and sublattice permutation, a small LC produces a large\nJosephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to the roton\nsuperconductor where the relative phases of the 3 SC components are locked at\n120{\\deg}, forming an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density\nmodulations. Properties of the roton superconductor include topological chiral\nedge states carrying nonzero electric currents, fractional 1/3 vortex\nexcitations and charge-6e Cooper pair triplets that are immune to the internal\nchiral phase fluctuations. We discuss these SC properties in connection to\nrecent experimental evidence for TRS breaking chiral SC state in kagome\nsuperconductors, exhibiting pair density modulations, zero-field SC diode\neffect, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for\nthe interplay between the orbital-driven quantum anomalous Hall and SC states\nin other systems, e.g. the graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide based\nquantum materials.",

This phenomenon plays a crucial role in a\nvariety of plasma technologies, including Hall thrusters, where azimuthal\ninstabilities significantly influence electron confinement and, hence, device\nperformance. While the impact of prominent plasma instabilities, such as the\nelectron cyclotron drift instability (ECDI) and the modified two-stream\ninstability (MTSI) on cross-field transport of electron species is well\nrecognized and widely studied, strategies for actively manipulating these\ndynamics remain underexplored. In this study, we investigate the effect of\ntargeted wave excitation on instability evolution and electron transport using\none- and two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of representative plasma\ndischarge configurations. A time-varying electric field is applied axially to\nmodulate the spectral energy distribution of the instabilities across a range\nof forcing frequencies and amplitudes. Our results reveal that the so-called\n\"unsteady forcing\" can both suppress and amplify instability modes depending on\nexcitation parameters. In particular, across both 1D and 2D simulation\nconfigurations, forcing near 40 MHz effectively reduces ECDI amplitude and\ndecreases axial electron transport by about 30%, while high-frequency\nexcitation near the electron cyclotron frequency induces spectral broadening,\ninverse energy cascades, and enhanced transport. These findings point to the\nrole of nonlinear frequency locking and energy pathway disruption as mechanisms\nfor modifying instability-driven transport.

The analysis yields three main results: (1)~when agents share\ninformation strategically, the optimal signaling policy involves\nequal-probability randomization between truthful and inverted beliefs;\n(2)~agents maximize performance by relying solely on their own observations for\nbelief updating while using received information only to anticipate their\ncounterpart's stopping decision; and (3)~the agent reaching their confidence\nthreshold first cause the other agent to achieve a higher conditional\nprobability of error.

This prevents the application of\nwell-developed approaches to requirements-based testing to DNNs.\n  To address this, we propose a requirements-based testing method (RBT4DNN)\nthat uses natural language requirements statements. These statements use a\nglossary of terms to define a semantic feature space that can be leveraged for\ntest input generation. RBT4DNN formalizes preconditions of functional\nrequirements as logical combinations of those semantic features. Training data\nmatching these feature combinations can be used to fine-tune a generative model\nto reliably produce test inputs satisfying the precondition. Executing these\ntests on a trained DNN enables comparing its output to the expected requirement\npostcondition behavior. We propose two use cases for RBT4DNN: (1) given\nrequirements defining DNN correctness properties, RBT4DNN comprises a novel\napproach for detecting faults, and (2) during development, requirements-guided\nexploration of model behavior can provide developers with feedback on model\ngeneralization. Our further evaluation shows that RBT4DNN-generated tests are\nrealistic, diverse, and aligned with requirement preconditions, enabling\ntargeted analysis of model behavior and effective fault detection.",

At the end of the study, blood\nsamples were taken from the heart, including blood-red blood cells, hemoglobin,\nhematocrit and platelets using a fully automated blood cell counting machine.\nThe results showed that the new dietary supplement reduced the level of\nhematocrit and platelets in the studied rats.

Specifically, our\napproach consists of three stages: first, equipping the model with Ex-Ante\nreasoning through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using a constructed reasoning\nmodule; second, enhancing safety, usefulness, and efficiency via Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO); and third, mitigating inference latency with a\nlength-controlled iterative preference optimization strategy.

This paper introduces directional routing, a dynamic approach\nthat flexibly adjusts shipment paths, optimizing efficiency and consolidation\nusing real-time logistics data. Unlike shortest-path routing, which follows\nfixed routes, directional routing dynamically selects feasible next-hop hubs\nbased on network conditions, consolidation opportunities, and service level\nconstraints. It consists of two phases: area discovery, which identifies\ncandidate hubs, and node selection, which determines the next hub based on\nreal-time parameters. This paper advances the area discovery phase by\nintroducing a Reduced Search Space Breadth-First Search (RSS-BFS) method to\nsystematically identify feasible routing areas while balancing service levels\nand consolidation. The proposed approach enhances network fluidity,\nscalability, and adaptability in PI-based logistics, advancing autonomous and\nsustainable freight movement.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the anisotropic properties of biomaterials, two distinct\nclasses are considered: polymer-based (e.g., cellulose in plants) and\ncrystalline-based (e.g., enamel in teeth), each demonstrating distinct\nstructural and functional characteristics. Four-angle polarization (4-pol.)\nspectral mapping of sub-1 {\\mu}m bamboo slices was carried out in the mid-IR\nspectral range (2.5-20 {\\mu}m) to reveal the 3D organization of the chemical\nbonding of cellulose using the key characteristic absorption bands associated\nwith C-O-C and C-N vibrational modes. The longitudinal and transverse microtome\nslices revealed a switch between the presence and absence of dichroism in\nparenchyma cell walls and vascular bundles. The cell wall showed continuous\nalignment of the C-O-C stretching vibrational mode (8.6 {\\mu}m/1163 cm-1) down\nto the pixel resolution of ~ 4 {\\mu}m (the step size in imaging) in the\ntransverse slice; the cell wall thickness is ~ 1 {\\mu}m. Thin microtomed slices\nof a tooth were measured in transmission and reflection modes. The single-point\nreflection measurements, performed using two perpendicular orientations,\nrevealed orientational anisotropy in the enamel, which was absent in the dentin\nregion. High sub-diffraction limited lateral resolution was numerically\nvalidated using a simplified-model of a Gaussian beam reading out material\npixels with a defined orientation of absorption. It is shown that the\norientation of small ~ {\\lambda}/10 ~ 1 {\\mu}m objects can be revealed using a\nfocal spot of ~ {\\lambda}/NA ~ 20 {\\mu}m, defining the diffraction limit for\nthe objective lens with a numerical aperture NA ~ 0.5.",

The result is a convex quadratic terminal\ncost that can be seamlessly integrated into the MPC formulation. The proposed\ncontroller is tested in simulations on a trajectory tracking problem for a\nquadcopter with nonlinear dynamics and bounded state and control.

Compared to pure RL, PEPT achieves 1000 times lower constraint\nviolation cost with only twice the feedback time. Against the best MPC-based\npolicy, PEPT reduces constraint violations by 2 to 5 times and runs nearly 3\ntimes faster while maintaining similar tracking performance.

Meanwhile, current adversarial\ntraining methods predominantly focus on robustness against adversarial attacks\nwithout explicitly leveraging geometric structures in the latent space, usually\nresulting in reduced accuracy on the original clean data. We propose a novel\nframework named Adversarially trained Deep Positive-Negative Prototypes\n(Adv-DPNP), which integrates discriminative prototype-based learning with\nadversarial training. Adv-DPNP uses unified class prototypes that serve as both\nclassifier weights and robust anchors in the latent space. Moreover, a novel\ndual-branch training mechanism maintains stable prototypes by updating them\nexclusively with clean data, while the feature extractor is trained on both\nclean and adversarial inputs to increase invariance to adversarial\nperturbations. In addition, we use a composite loss that combines\npositive-prototype alignment, negative-prototype repulsion, and consistency\nregularization to further enhance discrimination, adversarial robustness, and\nclean accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10/100 and\nSVHN) confirm that Adv-DPNP improves clean accuracy over state-of-the-art\ndefenses and baseline methods, while maintaining competitive or superior\nrobustness under a suite of widely used attacks, including FGSM, PGD, C\\&W, and\nAutoAttack.

In\ncontrast to the typical case of constructive interference at points of\nstationary phase, waves excited by the particle near jerking points avoid\ncancellation through rapid changes in frequency. Through an asymptotic\nanalysis, we derive the wave force from jerking points, revealing it as an\nelusive but crucial remnant of the particle's past motion that underlies a\nrange of phenomena previously regarded as disparate -- including in-line speed\noscillations, wave-like statistics in potential wells, and non-specular\nreflections -- and places them within a unified mechanistic framework resulting\nfrom generic wave superposition principles.",

In the temporal domain, methods relying on\nself-attention can, in theory, leverage the lucky effects of turbulence, but\ntheir quadratic complexity makes it difficult to scale to many frames.\nTraditional recurrent aggregation methods face parallelization challenges.\n  In this paper, we present a new TM method based on two concepts: (1) A\nturbulence mitigation network based on the Selective State Space Model\n(MambaTM). MambaTM provides a global receptive field in each layer across\nspatial and temporal dimensions while maintaining linear computational\ncomplexity. (2) Learned Latent Phase Distortion (LPD). LPD guides the state\nspace model. Unlike classical Zernike-based representations of phase\ndistortion, the new LPD map uniquely captures the actual effects of turbulence,\nsignificantly improving the model's capability to estimate degradation by\nreducing the ill-posedness. Our proposed method exceeds current\nstate-of-the-art networks on various synthetic and real-world TM benchmarks\nwith significantly faster inference speed.",

A continuous-wave tunable diode laser produces a\nlaser sheet that irradiates the plasma, and the resulting fluorescence is\ncaptured by an intensified CCD (ICCD) camera. Fluorescence images recorded at\nvarying laser wavelengths are converted into 2D IVDFs using the Doppler shift\nprinciple. Comparing six image filters, the singular-value decomposition\n(SVD)-based noise filtering is identified as the most effective for enhancing\nthe signal-to-noise ratio while preserving the IVDF structure. The developed\nICCD-based PLIF system is tested in an electron-beam generated $E \\times B$\nplasma with a moderate bulk plasma density of $\\sim10^{10}$ $cm^{-3}$. The PLIF\nmeasurements are validated against a conventional single-point LIF method using\nphotomultiplier tube (PMT)-based detection at various positions. The\nphase-resolving capability of the system is tested by oscillating the plasma\nbetween two nominal operating modes with different density profiles and\ntriggering the ICCD camera with the externally driven plasma oscillation. The\nresulting oscillations in fluorescence intensity show good agreement with\nplasma density variations measured by electrostatic probes, demonstrating the\nsystems ability to resolve phase-dependent dynamics.

To this end, we study the band topology of magnons on the star\nlattice in the presence of a strong out-of-plane magnetic field using linear\nspin-wave theory. By calculating the Chern numbers of magnon bands, we find\nthat topological phase diagrams are predominantly composed of two distinct\ntopological phases whose Chern numbers are different by a sign in inverse\norder. Remarkably, each phase is characterized by a high Chern number of either\n$+2$ or $-2$. In addition, several topological flat bands with large flatness\nare identified. The two phases are separated by a dozen narrow topological\nhigh-Chern-number segments, whose region shrinks as the magnetic field\nincreases and vanishes eventually.

Our novel constraints are in good\nagreement with state-of-the-art ground-based quasar Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest\nobservations, and will become competitive as the number of JWST $z>5$ galaxy\nspectra rapidly increases.

Using Monte Carlo\ntechniques, we calculate the number of CPs and MSPs that would comprise the\nsample of pulsar-like unidentified sources (PLUIDs) in 4FGL-DR4. While radio\nbeaming fractions were used to scale the sizes of the populations, when forming\nthe mock 4FGL-DR4 samples, we make the simplifying assumption that all\n$\\gamma-$ray pulsars are beaming towards the Earth. We then explore the\nobservable outcomes of seven different $\\gamma-$ray luminosity models. Four of\nthe models provide a good match to the observed number of PLUIDs, while three\nothers significantly over-predict the number of PLUIDs. For these latter\nmodels, either the average beaming fraction of $\\gamma-$ray pulsars is more\nlike 25--50\\%, or a revision in the luminosity scaling is required. Most of the\nradio detectable MSPs that our models predict as part of the PLUIDs within\n4FGL-DR4 are, unsurprisingly, fainter than the currently observed sample and at\nlarger dispersion measures. For CPs, in spite of an excellent match to the\nobserved radio population, none of the $\\gamma-$ray models we investigated\ncould replicate the observed sample of 150 $\\gamma-$ray CPs. Further work is\nrequired to understand this discrepancy.

    "abstract": "In large-scale distributed applications, efficient and reliable broadcast\nprotocols are essential for node communication. Tree-based broadcast lacks\nflexibility and may suffer performance degradation or even broadcast failure\nwhen cluster membership changes. Gossip-based broadcast incurs high bandwidth\noverhead and only provides probabilistic delivery guarantees. In tree-based\nbroadcasting, when an internal node leaves, its child nodes need to reconnect\nto a new parent. This process may introduce instability, leading to potential\nmessage duplication and increased transmission latency. However, in cloud\nenvironments, node departures and arrivals are common, causing frequent\nperformance degradation in tree-based broadcasting. This paper introduces Snow,\na self-organizing broadcast protocol designed for cloud environments. Instead,\nit dynamically sends or forwards messages based on each node's membership view,\nultimately forming a broadcast structure resembling a multi-way balanced\ntree(the height difference of leaf nodes is at most 1).

However, its real-world application often fails due to a\nlack of user acceptance and trust. A possible remedy is to provide managers\nwith the possibility of altering the RL policy by incorporating human expert\nknowledge. In this study, we analyze the benefits and caveats of including\nhuman knowledge via action masking. While action masking has so far been used\nto exclude invalid actions, its ability to integrate human expertise remains\nunderexplored. Human knowledge is often encapsulated in heuristics, which\nsuggest reasonable, near-optimal actions in certain situations. Enforcing such\nactions should hence increase trust among the human workforce to rely on the\nmodel's decisions. Yet, a strict enforcement of heuristic actions may also\nrestrict the policy from exploring superior actions, thereby leading to overall\nlower performance. We analyze the effects of action masking based on three\nproblems with different characteristics, namely, paint shop scheduling, peak\nload management, and inventory management. Our findings demonstrate that\nincorporating human knowledge through action masking can achieve substantial\nimprovements over policies trained without action masking. In addition, we find\nthat action masking is crucial for learning effective policies in constrained\naction spaces, where certain actions can only be performed a limited number of\ntimes. Finally, we highlight the potential for suboptimal outcomes when action\nmasks are overly restrictive.",

The distance-based optimality criterion induces a\nspace-filling design within a user-defined region of interest in a surrogate\nmodel's input space, requiring only minimal prior knowledge. Additionally, the\nmethod is applicable both online, where model parameters are continuously\nupdated based on process observations, and offline, where a fixed model is\nemployed.\n  The space-filling performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated on an\nartificial example and compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating\nsuperior efficiency in exploring process operating regions.",

To\naddress these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Frequency Enhancement Network\n(AFENet), which integrates two key components: the Adaptive Frequency and\nSpatial feature Interaction Module (AFSIM) and the Selective feature Fusion\nModule (SFM). AFSIM dynamically separates and modulates high- and low-frequency\nfeatures according to the content of the input image. It adaptively generates\ntwo masks to separate high- and low-frequency components, therefore providing\noptimal details and contextual supplementary information for ground object\nfeature representation. SFM selectively fuses global context and local detailed\nfeatures to enhance the network's representation capability. Hence, the\ninteractions between frequency and spatial features are further enhanced.\nExtensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed AFENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we also\nvalidate the effectiveness of AFSIM and SFM in managing diverse land cover\ntypes and complex scenarios. Our codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/oucailab/AFENet.",

Indeed, for would-be scale-separated\nstring vacua with parametrically heavy stabilised scalars -- dubbed\n\\emph{rigid} compactifications -- one recovers the EFT intuition where only\nsmall black holes probe the UV.

In these top-down\nmodels we still observe large field variations for large black holes which can\nbe traced back to the absence of parametrically heavy moduli.

In the\nearly 1940s the first artificial neuron models were created as purely\nmathematical concepts. Over the years, ideas from neuroscience and computer\nscience were used to develop the modern Neural Network. The interest in these\nmodels rose quickly but fell when they failed to be successfully applied to\npractical applications, and rose again in the late 2000s with the drastic\nincrease in computing power, notably in the field of natural language\nprocessing, for example with the state-of-the-art speech recognizer making\nheavy use of deep neural networks.\n  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), a class of neural networks with cycles in\nthe network, exacerbates the difficulties of traditional neural nets. Slow\nconvergence limiting the use to small networks, and difficulty to train through\ngradient-descent methods because of the recurrent dynamics have hindered\nresearch on RNNs, yet their biological plausibility and their capability to\nmodel dynamical systems over simple functions makes then interesting for\ncomputational researchers.\n  Reservoir Computing emerges as a solution to these problems that RNNs\ntraditionally face. Promising to be both theoretically sound and\ncomputationally fast, Reservoir Computing has already been applied successfully\nto numerous fields: natural language processing, computational biology and\nneuroscience, robotics, even physics. This survey will explore the history and\nappeal of both traditional feed-forward and recurrent neural networks, before\ndescribing the theory and models of this new reservoir computing paradigm.\nFinally recent papers using reservoir computing in a variety of scientific\nfields will be reviewed.",

To explore these variations, this study conducts a\ncomparative analysis of leading universities in the United States, Japan, and\nChina, examining their institution-wide policies on GAI application and\ngovernance. Based on these findings, the study proposes a University Policy\nDevelopment Framework for GAI (UPDF-GAI) to provide both theoretical insights\nand practical guidance for universities in developing and refining their GAI\npolicies. A qualitative content analysis of 124 policy documents from 110\nuniversities was conducted, employing thematic coding to synthesize 20 key\nthemes and 9 sub-themes. These themes and sub-themes formed the basis for\ndeveloping the framework. The analysis reveals varying priorities and focus of\nGAI policy of universities in different countries. U.S. universities emphasize\nfaculty autonomy, practical application, and policy adaptability, shaped by\ncutting-edge research and peer collaboration. Japanese universities take a\ngovernment-regulated approach, prioritizing ethics and risk management, but\nprovide limited support for AI implementation and flexibility. Chinese\nuniversities follow a centralized, government-led model, focusing on technology\napplication over early policy development, while actively exploring GAI\nintegration in education and research. The UPDF-GAI framework offers a\nsystematic, adaptable framework for assessing and optimizing GAI policies\nacross different educational contexts.

Despite extensive studies, the detection of the\nrelativistic Fe K emission line, has been inconsistently reported and no\nmeasurement of the system inclination has been achieved. In this work, we\ninvestigate the broadband spectral and polarimetric properties of 4U 1820-30,\nexploring the presence of a reflection component and its role in shaping the\npolarization signal. We analyzed simultaneous X-ray observations from NICER,\nNuSTAR, and IXPE. The spectral continuum was modeled with a disk blackbody, a\npower law, and a Comptonization component with seed photons originating from a\nboundary layer. We detected a strong reflection component, described, for the\nfirst time, with two self-consistent models ({\\tt Relxillns} and {\\tt\nRfxconv}), allowing us to provide a measurement of the system inclination angle\n(about 31 degrees), supporting the low-inclination hypothesis. Subsolar iron\nabundances were detected in the accretion disk and interstellar medium,\nprobably related to the source location in a metal-poor globular cluster. The\npolarization increases from an upper limit of $1.2\\%$ in the 2--4 keV band up\nto about $8\\%$ in the 7--8 keV range.

Specifically, EmbodiedSense consists\nof a context-aware scenario recognition module and spatial-aware activity\ndetection, which is further integrated with other attributes by expert\nknowledge. We implement our system on commercial earphones equipped with\nbinaural microphones and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). By distinguishing\nusage scenarios and identifying the source of sounds, EmbodiedSense enables\nfine-grained activity logs in a zero-shot manner (evaluated with up to 41\ncategories) and outperforms strong baselines like ImageBind-LLM by 38%\nF1-score.

Building upon our previous works on logarithmically\nimproved and multi-level logarithmically improved criteria, we demonstrate that\nthe limiting case of infinitely nested logarithms fully bridges the gap between\nsubcritical and critical regularity. Specifically, we prove that if the initial\ndata $u_0 \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^3)$ satisfies the condition\n$\\|(-\\Delta)^{1/4}u_0\\|_{L^q(\\mathbb{R}^3)} \\leq\nC_0\\Psi(\\|u_0\\|_{\\dot{H}^{1/2}})$, where $\\Psi$ incorporates infinitely nested\nlogarithmic factors with appropriate decay conditions, then there exists a\nunique global-in-time smooth solution to the Navier-Stokes equations. This\nresult establishes global well-posedness at the critical regularity threshold\n$s = 1/2$. The proof relies on infinitely nested commutator estimates, precise\ncharacterization of the critical exponent function in the limiting case, and\ncareful analysis of the energy cascade. We also derive the exact Hausdorff\ndimension bound for potential singular sets in this limiting case, proving that\nthe dimension reduces to zero.

Our contribution is the first to\nsimultaneously achieve both. Let r(F, P) denote the minimal number of\nretrievals required by any algorithm to determine the convex hull of P for a\ngiven instance (F, P). For a family F of n constant-complexity polygons, our\nmain result is a reconstruction algorithm that performs O(r(F, P)) retrievals\nin O(r(F, P) log^3 n) time.\n  Compared to previous approaches that achieve optimal retrieval counts, we\nimprove the runtime per retrieval by a exponential factor, from polynomial to\npolylogarithmic. Compared to near-linear time algorithms, we significantly\nreduce the number of retrievals used, and broaden the input families to include\noverlapping regions. We further extend our results to simple k-gons and to\npairwise disjoint disks with radii in [1,k], where our runtime scales linearly\nwith k.",

We compare male and female students'\nperformance in courses which make significant use of evidence-based active\nengagement (EBAE) strategies with courses that primarily use lecture-based (LB)\ninstruction. The analysis presented here includes data from two-semester\nsequences of introductory algebra-based and calculus-based introductory physics\ncourses. The surveys used to assess student learning in the first and second\nsemester courses were the Force Concept Inventory and the Conceptual Survey of\nElectricity and Magnetism, respectively. The performance of male and female\nstudents in EBAE courses at a particular level is compared with LB courses in\ntwo situations: (I) the same instructor taught two courses, one of which was an\nEBAE course and the other an LB course, while the homework, recitations and\nfinal exams were kept the same, (II) student performance in all of the EBAE\ncourses taught by different instructors was averaged and compared with LB\ncourses of the same type also averaged over different instructors. In all\ncases, we find that students in courses which make significant use of EBAE\nstrategies, on average, outperformed students in courses of the same type using\nprimarily LB instruction even though there was no statistically significant\ndifference on the pretest before instruction. However, the gender gap persisted\neven in courses using EBAE methods. We also discuss correlations between the\nperformance of male and female students on the validated conceptual surveys and\nthe final exam, which had a heavy weight on quantitative problem solving.",

Realistic analysis of leukemia\nrequires white blood cell (WBC) localization, classification, and morphological\nassessment. Despite deep learning advances in medical imaging, leukemia\nanalysis lacks a large, diverse multi-task dataset, while existing small\ndatasets lack domain diversity, limiting real-world applicability. To overcome\ndataset challenges, we present a large-scale WBC dataset named Large Leukemia\nDataset (LLD) and novel methods for detecting WBC with their attributes. Our\ncontribution here is threefold. First, we present a large-scale Leukemia\ndataset collected through Peripheral Blood Films (PBF) from 48 patients,\nthrough multiple microscopes, multi-cameras, and multi-magnification. To\nenhance diagnosis explainability and medical expert acceptance, each leukemia\ncell is annotated at 100x with 7 morphological attributes, ranging from Cell\nSize to Nuclear Shape. Secondly, we propose a multi-task model that not only\ndetects WBCs but also predicts their attributes, providing an interpretable and\nclinically meaningful solution. Third, we propose a method for WBC detection\nwith attribute analysis using sparse annotations. This approach reduces the\nannotation burden on hematologists, requiring them to mark only a small area\nwithin the field of view. Our method enables the model to leverage the entire\nfield of view rather than just the annotated regions, enhancing learning\nefficiency and diagnostic accuracy.

    "abstract": "Cosmic rays (CR), both solar and Galactic, have an ionising effect on the\nEarth's atmosphere and are thought to be important for prebiotic molecule\nproduction. In particular, the $\\rm{H_2}$-dominated atmosphere following an\nocean-vaporising impact is considered favourable to prebiotic molecule\nformation. We model solar and Galactic CR transport through a post-impact early\nEarth atmosphere at 200Myr. We aim to identify the differences in the resulting\nionisation rates, $\\zeta$, particularly at the Earth's surface during a period\nwhen the Sun was very active. We use a Monte Carlo model to describe CR\ntransport through the early Earth atmosphere, giving the CR spectra as a\nfunction of altitude. We calculate $\\zeta$ and the ion-pair production rate,\n$Q$, as a function of altitude due to Galactic and solar CR. The Galactic and\nsolar CR spectra are both affected by the Sun's rotation rate, $\\Omega$,\nbecause the solar wind velocity and magnetic field strength both depend on\n$\\Omega$ and influence CR transport. We consider a range of input spectra\nresulting from the range of possible $\\Omega$, from $3.5-15\\,\n\\Omega_{\\rm{\\odot}}$. To account for the possibility that the Galactic CR\nspectrum outside the Solar System varies over Gyr timescales, we compare\ntop-of-atmosphere $\\zeta$ resulting from two different scenarios. We also\nconsider the suppression of the CR spectra by a planetary magnetic field. We\nfind that $\\zeta$ and $Q$ due to CR are dominated by solar CR in the early\nEarth atmosphere for most cases. The corresponding $\\zeta$ at the early Earth's\nsurface ranges from $5 \\times 10^{-21}\\rm{s^{-1}}$ for $\\Omega =\n3.5\\,\\Omega_{\\rm{\\odot}}$ to $1 \\times 10^{-16}\\rm{s^{-1}}$ for $\\Omega =\n15\\,\\Omega_{\\rm{\\odot}}$. Thus if the young Sun was a fast rotator, it is\nlikely that solar CR had a significant effect on the chemistry at the Earth's\nsurface at the time when life is likely to have formed.",

The system consists of masses that are coupled by linear springs\nand are mounted on flexural beams whose cross section (and, hence, stiffness)\nis modulated. We show that this system is the simplest version possible to\nachieve the Hofstadter butterfly exactly; in particular, the local resonances\ndue to the beams are an essential component for this. We examine the various\napproaches to producing spectral butterflies, including Bloch spectra for\nrational parameter choices, resonances of finite-sized systems and transmission\ncoefficients of sections of finite length. For finite-size systems, we study\nthe localisation of the modes by calculating the inverse participation ratio,\nand detect a phase transition characterised by a critical value of the\nstiffness modulation amplitude, where the state of the system changes from\nmainly extended to localised, corresponding to a metal-insulator phase\ntransition. The obtained results offer a practical strategy to realize\nexperimentally a system with similar dynamical properties. The transmission\ncoefficient for sections of finite length is benchmarked through the comparison\nwith Bloch spectra of the same finite-sized systems.

    "abstract": "Whether studying gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals or\nexploring the analogy between massless spin-particle waves, black hole\nperturbation theory proves indispensable. At the heart of developing a\nuniversal perturbation framework for such problems lies the challenge of\nformulating a coordinate-independent, unified wave equation that is universally\napplicable to any black hole spacetime. This paper resolves this central issue\nin type-D spacetimes by establishing a new definition of spin coefficients.\nSpecifically, we introduce a new definition for the spin coefficients $\\rho$,\n$\\mu$, $\\tau$, and $\\pi$, which are defined as the directional derivatives of\nthe logarithm of a generating function along the null tetrad ($l^{\\mu}$,\n$n^{\\mu}$, $m^{\\mu}$, $\\bar{m}^{\\mu}$), respectively. This is the first\ndiscovery that these spin coefficients are interconnected through a generating\nfunction. Using the newly defined spin coefficients, we find that the field\nequations for massless particles with spins 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, and 2 in arbitrary\ntype-D black hole spacetimes can be described by a single unified equation.\nThis finding is particularly surprising, as unifying these field equations is\nalready a significant challenge in flat spacetime, let alone in the intricate\nspacetime around black holes. Consequently, this work will inevitably prompt a\nre-examination of the shared characteristics among various types of particles\nin black hole spacetimes. Meanwhile, we verify the correctness of the new\ndefinition for the spin coefficients, and provide the explicit form of the\nunified equation for nearly all known type-D black hole backgrounds. This lays\na solid foundation for studying the behavior of massless spin particles in any\ntype-D black hole background.",

These systems\nexhibit emergent collective behaviors that have no direct thermal-equilibrium\ncounterpart. Their scale ranges from micrometer-sized swarms of bacteria to\nmeter-scale human crowds. In recent years, the role of topology and\nself-propelled topological defects in active systems has garnered significant\nattention, particularly in polar and nematic active matter. Building on these\nideas, we investigate emergent collective dynamics in apolar active granular\nfluids. Using isotropic granular vibrators as a model experimental system of\napolar active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles in a dry environment, we uncover a\ndistinctive three-stage time evolution arising from the intricate interplay\nbetween activity and inelastic interactions. By analyzing the statistics,\nspatial correlations, and dynamics of vortex-like topological defects in the\ndisplacement vector field, we demonstrate their ability to describe this\nintrinsic collective motion. Furthermore, associated to these topological\ndefects, we reveal the onset of a turbulent-like inverse energy cascade, where\nkinetic energy transfers across different length scales over time. As the\nsystem evolves, the power scaling of the energy transfer increases with the\nduration of observation. Our findings show that topological concepts can be\nextended to the nonequilibrium dynamics of apolar active matter, revealing a\ndirect link between microscopic topological processes and emergent large-scale\nbehaviors in active granular fluids that lack both a well-defined direction of\nmotion and an intrinsic axis of orientation at the particle scale.",

    "abstract": "Effective field theory is an effective approach to parameterizing effects of\nhigh energy scale physics in low energy measurements. The two popular\nframeworks for physics beyond the standard model are the so-called standard\nmodel effective field theory (SMEFT) and the Higgs effective field theory\n(HEFT). While the description by the SMEFT deteriorates when the scale of new\nphysics is not so high or it participates in spontaneous electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, the HEFT makes use of nonlinear realization of spontaneously broken\nsymmetry in which there are practically no restrictions on the Higgs field as a\nsinglet. In this work we present another framework, called broken phase\neffective field theory (bEFT), in which we deal directly with mass eigenstate\nfields after spontaneous symmetry breaking without employing nonlinear\nrealization. We take the type-II seesaw model as an example to demonstrate our\napproach. By matching the model to both the bEFT and the SMEFT at tree level,\nwe compare the results for two processes, the Higgs pair production via vector\nboson fusion which appears as a subprocess at the LHC and the Higgs-strahlung\nprocess at a future electron-positron collider. We find that the bEFT\nreproduces the type-II seesaw model more accurately than the SMEFT in the\nregions where the bare mass of the Higgs triplet becomes close to the\nelectroweak scale. Therefore, the bEFT serves as a useful framework that can\ncompensate for the shortcomings in both the SMEFT and the HEFT when dealing\nwith UV models that involve Higgs mixing or new particles with a mass close to\nthe electroweak scale.",

    "abstract": "Highly irradiated exoplanets undergo extreme hydrodynamic atmospheric escape,\ndue to their high level of received XUV flux. Over their lifetime, this escape\nvaries significantly, making evolution studies essential for interpreting the\ngrowing number of observations of escaping planetary atmospheres. In a previous\nwork, we modelled this evolving escape, alongside one of its observable\ntracers, the helium triplet transit signature at 1083nm. Using hydrodynamic and\nray-tracing models, we demonstrated that atmospheric escape and the\ncorresponding He 1083nm signature are stronger at younger ages, for a\n0.3$~M_\\text{J}$ gas-giant. Yet, the current literature includes several young\n(<1Gyr) planets with weak or non-detections in He 1083nm. To understand this\napparent discrepancy, we now perform detailed modelling for many of these\nsystems. The resulting He 1083nm predictions align relatively well with the\nobservations. From our two studies, we conclude that for any given planet,\nstronger atmospheric escape during younger ages produces deeper He 1083nm\nabsorption. However, for a population of exoplanets, the relation between\nyounger ages and stronger He absorptions is lost to the broad diversity of\ntheir various other system parameters. Accordingly, for the current sample of\nyoung, 1083nm-observed exoplanets, alternative trends take precedence. One such\ntrend is that planets with deeper geometrical transits exhibit more favourable\ndetections. Our modelling also agrees with the strong empirical trend in the\nliterature between $ EW \\cdot R_{*}^{2}$ and $F_{\\text{xuv}} \\cdot\nR_{\\text{pl}}^2 / \\Phi_{g}$.

    "abstract": "The recent advancements in Deep Learning models and techniques have led to\nsignificant strides in performance across diverse tasks and modalities.\nHowever, while the overall capabilities of models show promising growth, our\nunderstanding of their internal reasoning processes remains limited,\nparticularly concerning systematic inconsistencies or errors patterns of\nlogical or inferential flaws. These inconsistencies may manifest as\ncontradictory outputs, failure to generalize across similar tasks, or erroneous\nconclusions in specific contexts. Even detecting and measuring such reasoning\ndiscrepancies is challenging, as they may arise from opaque internal\nprocedures, biases and imbalances in training data, or the inherent complexity\nof the task. Without effective methods to detect, measure, and mitigate these\nerrors, there is a risk of deploying models that are biased, exploitable, or\nlogically unreliable. This thesis aims to address these issues by producing\nnovel methods for deep learning models that reason over knowledge graphs,\nnatural language, and images. The thesis contributes two techniques for\ndetecting and quantifying predictive inconsistencies originating from opaque\ninternal procedures in natural language and image processing models. To\nmitigate inconsistencies from biases in training data, this thesis presents a\ndata efficient sampling method to improve fairness and performance and a\nsynthetic dataset generation approach in low resource scenarios. Finally, the\nthesis offers two techniques to optimize the models for complex reasoning\ntasks. These methods enhance model performance while allowing for more faithful\nand interpretable exploration and exploitation during inference.

Both data-related bias (from biased training data) and\nmodel-related bias (from model training) were significant contributors. Biases\nmanifested as: allocative harm (e.g., differential treatment recommendations);\nrepresentational harm (e.g., stereotypical associations, biased image\ngeneration); and performance disparities (e.g., variable output quality). These\nbiases affected multiple attributes, most frequently race/ethnicity and gender,\nbut also age, disability, and language. Conclusions: Bias in clinical LLMs is a\npervasive and systemic issue, with a potential to lead to misdiagnosis and\ninappropriate treatment, particularly for marginalized patient populations.\nRigorous evaluation of the model is crucial. Furthermore, the development and\nimplementation of effective mitigation strategies, coupled with continuous\nmonitoring in real-world clinical settings, are essential to ensure the safe,\nequitable, and trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare.",

By assuming that the field changes are advection-dominated,\nthe fluid motion at the core surface can be related to the secular variation of\nthe geomagnetic field. The majority of existing core flow models are global,\nshowing features such as an eccentric planetary gyre, with some evidence of\nrapid regional changes. By construction, the flow defined at any location by\nsuch a model depends on all magnetic field variations across the entire\ncore-mantle boundary making it challenging to interpret local structures in the\nflow as due to specific local changes in magnetic field. Here we present an\nalternative strategy in which we construct regional flow models that rely only\non local secular changes. We use a novel technique based on machine learning\ntermed Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), in which we seek a regional\nflow model that simultaneously fits both the local magnetic field variation and\ndynamical conditions assumed satisfied by the flow. Although we present results\nusing the Tangentially Geostrophic flow constraint, we set out a modelling\nframework for which the physics constraint can be easily changed by altering a\nsingle line of code. After validating the PINN-based method on synthetic flows,\nwe apply our method to the CHAOS-8.1 geomagnetic field model, itself based on\ndata from Swarm. Constructing a global mosaic of regional flows, we reproduce\nthe planetary gyre, providing independent evidence that the strong secular\nchanges at high latitude and in equatorial regions are part of the same global\nfeature. Our models also corroborate regional changes in core flows over the\nlast decade. Furthermore, our models endorse the existence of a dynamic high\nlatitude jet, which began accelerating around 2005 but has been weakening since\n2017.",

In contrast, MAD policies introduce\nexplicit feedback on state-dependent features - a key element behind the\nsuccess of RL pipelines - without compromising closed-loop stability. This is\nachieved by describing the magnitude of the control input with a\ndisturbance-feedback Lp-stable operator, while selecting its direction based on\nstate-dependent features through a universal function approximator. We further\ncharacterize the robust stability properties of MAD policies under model\nmismatch. Unlike existing disturbance-feedback policy parameterizations, MAD\npolicies introduce state-feedback components compatible with model-free RL\npipelines, ensuring closed-loop stability without requiring model information\nbeyond open-loop stability.

The observations present a\nrelatively complete afterglow structure, including two X-ray flares (Flares I\nand II), optical onset (Slice 1), normal decay (Slices 2 and 3), and a possible\njet break. The spectrum of the bright X-ray flare (Flare II) indicates that a\nthermal component exists at $t = 190$--240~s. \\textbf{The blackbody emits in\nthe photospheric radius $R_{\\rm ph}\\sim 10^{11}$ cm,} and its temperature\n($kT$) decreases with time from \\textbf{1.08 to 0.37 keV, its Lorentz factor of\nblackbody ($\\Gamma_{\\rm BB}$) decreases with time from 67.71 to 46.70. The\nluminosity of the blackbody ($L_{\\rm BB}$), $kT$ and $\\Gamma_{\\rm BB}$ follow\nthe relations $\\bf L_{\\rm BB} \\propto kT^{2.49\\pm 0.03}$ and $\\Gamma_{\\rm\nBB}\\propto L_{\\rm BB}^{0.27}$ (estimated from \\cite{fan2012}).} In the optical\nlight curves, there is an onset bump in the early-time afterglow, rising with\nan index $\\alpha_{O,1} \\approx -0.43$ and peaking $\\sim1174.9$ s since the BAT\ntrigger. The bump then decays with $\\bf \\alpha_{O,2} \\approx 0.88$ in the\nnormal decay phase, and the X-ray flux decays with a similar index of $\\bf\n\\alpha_{X,1} \\approx 0.95$.

The performance gap mainly arises from inaccurate\nlong-term motion estimation and prediction of distant frames, especially in\nlarge motion scenes. To solve these two critical problems, this paper proposes\na novel LBVC framework, namely L-LBVC. Firstly, we propose an adaptive motion\nestimation module that can handle both short-term and long-term motions.\nSpecifically, we directly estimate the optical flows for adjacent frames and\nnon-adjacent frames with small motions. For non-adjacent frames with large\nmotions, we recursively accumulate local flows between adjacent frames to\nestimate long-term flows. Secondly, we propose an adaptive motion prediction\nmodule that can largely reduce the bit cost for motion coding. To improve the\naccuracy of long-term motion prediction, we adaptively downsample reference\nframes during testing to match the motion ranges observed during training.\nExperiments show that our L-LBVC significantly outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art LVC methods and even surpasses VVC (VTM) on some test datasets\nunder random access configuration.",

We demonstrate\nthat the onset of glassiness depends on polymer stiffness, with increased\nrigidity enhancing configurational constraints and delaying structural\nrelaxation. In the glassy regime, the system exhibits hallmark aging\ncharacteristics, as evidenced by two-time correlation functions, namely the\nmean square displacement and self-intermediate scattering function, which\ndisplay a clear dependence on the waiting time following the thermal quench.\nThe extracted relaxation timescale ($\\tau_\\alpha$) follows an approximate\nsimple aging scenario with waiting time ($t_w$), described by $\\tau_\\alpha \\sim\nt_w^b$, where $0.8 < b < 0.93$. Finally, we analyze the threading of rings\nduring the thermal quench, demonstrating that both increased and persistent\nthreading correlate with the emergence of glassiness. Moreover, the threading\npersistence timescale exhibits a strong correlation with the structural\nrelaxation timescale. Our study thus provides a comprehensive view of\nstructural relaxation and aging in dense ring polymer systems, highlighting the\ncritical roles of topological constraints and polymer stiffness in governing\nnon-equilibrium glassy dynamics.",

Our framework provides a principled treatment of\nepistemic uncertainty by minimizing the mean Hamiltonian with respect to a\nposterior distribution over the system dynamics. We propose a multiple shooting\nnumerical method that leverages mean Hamiltonian minimization and is scalable\nto large-scale probabilistic dynamics models, including ensemble neural\nordinary differential equations. Comparisons against other baselines in online\nand offline model-based reinforcement learning tasks show that our\nprobabilistic Hamiltonian approach leads to reduced trial costs in offline\nsettings and achieves competitive performance in online scenarios.

    "abstract": "Talking head synthesis is vital for virtual avatars and human-computer\ninteraction. However, most existing methods are typically limited to accepting\ncontrol from a single primary modality, restricting their practical utility. To\nthis end, we introduce \\textbf{ACTalker}, an end-to-end video diffusion\nframework that supports both multi-signals control and single-signal control\nfor talking head video generation. For multiple control, we design a parallel\nmamba structure with multiple branches, each utilizing a separate driving\nsignal to control specific facial regions. A gate mechanism is applied across\nall branches, providing flexible control over video generation. To ensure\nnatural coordination of the controlled video both temporally and spatially, we\nemploy the mamba structure, which enables driving signals to manipulate feature\ntokens across both dimensions in each branch. Additionally, we introduce a\nmask-drop strategy that allows each driving signal to independently control its\ncorresponding facial region within the mamba structure, preventing control\nconflicts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces\nnatural-looking facial videos driven by diverse signals and that the mamba\nlayer seamlessly integrates multiple driving modalities without conflict.

Many existing\nmodels do not fully capture the complex, multiscale interactions among neuronal\nactivity, astrocytic signaling, and vascular dynamics--especially in key\nbrainstem regions. In this work, we present a 3D-1D-0D multiscale computational\nframework for modeling the neuro-glial-vascular unit (NGVU) in the dorsal vagal\ncomplex (DVC). Our approach integrates a quadripartite synapse model--which\nrepresents the interplay among excitatory and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes,\nand vascular smooth muscle cells--with a hierarchical description of vascular\ndynamics that couples a three-dimensional microcirculatory network with a\none-dimensional macrocirculatory representation and a zero-dimensional synaptic\ncomponent. By linking neuronal spiking, astrocytic calcium and gliotransmitter\nsignaling, and vascular tone regulation, our model reproduces key features of\nfunctional hyperemia and elucidates the feedback loops that help maintain\ncerebral blood flow. Simulation results demonstrate that neurotransmitter\nrelease triggers astrocytic responses that modulate vessel radius to optimize\noxygen and nutrient delivery. This integrated framework, to our knowledge the\nfirst model to combine these elements for the NGVU in the DVC, provides a\nrobust and modular platform for future investigations into the pathophysiology\nof cerebral blood flow regulation and its role in autonomic control, including\nthe regulation of stomach function.",

    "abstract": "In the present work, we aim to restore Book X of the $\\it{Elements}$ to its\noriginal Theaetetean, pre-Eudoxean form in two separate ways. First, we restore\nthe considerable mathematical content of Book X, by correlating Book X with\nPlato's account of Theaetetus' mathematical discoveries and Plato's imitations\nof these discoveries for his philosophy. Thus, Theaetetus proved (i) the\neventual periodicity of the anthyphairesis of lines a to b, satisfying $Ma^2 =\nNb^2$, for MN not square number; (ii) the eventual periodic anthyphairesis of\nlines a to b, satisfying more general quadratic expressions, including the\nApplication of Areas in defect, and employing this to show that the 12 classes\nof alogoi lines, including the minor, despite being alogoi, are determined by\nan eventually periodic Application of Areas in defect; (iii) the anthyphairetic\npalindromic periodicity of the anthyphairesis of the surds $\\sqrt{N}$ for any\nnon-square number N, of relevance to the general Pell's Diophantine problem.\nSecondly, we restore the proofs of all propositions of Book X, in such way that\nthese are proofs based on Theaetetus', and not on Eudoxus' theory of proportion\nof magnitudes, in particular not making any use of Eudoxus' condition (namely\nof definition 4 of Book V). The restoration is based on our reconstruction of\nTheaetetus' theory of proportion for magnitudes, for the limited class of\nratios a/b such that either a, b are commensurable or the anthyphairesis of a\nto b is eventually periodic, without employing Eudoxus' condition, and its\nsuccess provides a confirmation of our reconstruction.\n  The final version of this paper will appear as a chapter in the journal\nGanita Bh\\=arat\\=i, Bulletin of the Indian Society for History of Mathematics,\n(2) 45 (2023).",

However, predicting the structure of a material interface is\ncomputationally demanding due to the vast configuration space, which requires\nevaluating an unfeasibly large number of highly complex structures. We\nintroduce RAFFLE, a software package designed to efficiently explore low-energy\ninterface configurations between any two crystals. RAFFLE leverages physical\ninsights and genetic algorithms to intelligently sample the configuration\nspace, using dynamically evolving 2-, 3-, and 4-body distribution functions as\ngeneralised structural descriptors. These descriptors are iteratively updated\nthrough active learning, which inform atom placement strategies. RAFFLE's\neffectiveness is demonstrated across a diverse set of systems, including bulk\nmaterials, intercalation structures, and interfaces. When tested on bulk\naluminium and MoS$_2$, it successfully identifies known ground-state and\nhigh-pressure phases. Applied to intercalation systems, it predicts stable\nintercalant phases. For Si|Ge interfaces, RAFFLE identifies intermixing as a\nstrain compensation mechanism, generating reconstructions that are more stable\nthan abrupt interfaces. By accelerating interface structure prediction, RAFFLE\noffers a powerful tool for materials discovery, enabling efficient exploration\nof complex configuration spaces.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that, at sufficiently high temperature\nand energy density, nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition from confined\nhadrons to a deconfined state of quarks and gluons known as the quark-gluon\nplasma (QGP). One of the historically proposed signatures of QGP formation is\nstrangeness enhancement (SE), characterized by an increased production of\nstrange hadrons in heavy-ion collisions relative to proton--proton (pp)\ninteractions. At the LHC, the ALICE experiment has measured a continuous\nincrease in the strange-to-non-strange hadron yield ratios as a function of\nmidrapidity charged-particle multiplicity, not only in large systems like\nPb--Pb but also in small systems such as pp and p--Pb. The origin of SE in\nsmall systems is still under debate, motivating further experimental\ninvestigations. This article presents recent ALICE analyses that offer\ncomplementary insights into the phenomenon. These include (i)\nmulti-differential studies using event-shape observables such as transverse\nspherocity and the concept of effective energy, and (ii) the first measurement\nof multiplicity distributions of strange and multi-strange hadrons,\nP($\\textit{n}_{S}$), in pp collisions.",

Here, we present the first\nobservations of a novel effect of transverse velocities: the dipole signatures\nthat they imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background. The peculiar velocity\nfield points towards gravitational wells and away from potential hills,\nreflecting a large-scale dipole in the gravitational potential, coherent over\nhundreds of Mpc. Analogous dipoles will also exist in all other fields that\ncorrelate with the potential. These dipoles are readily observed in projection\non the CMB sky via gravitational lensing and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)\neffect -- both of which correlate with transverse peculiar velocities. The\nlarge-scale ISW dipole is distinct from the small-scale moving lens effect,\nwhich has a dipole of the opposite sign. We provide a unified framework for\nanalysing these velocity-related dipoles and demonstrate how stacking can\nextract the signal from sky maps of galaxy properties, CMB temperature, and\nlensing. We show that the CMB dipole signal is independent of galaxy bias, and\northogonal to the usual direction-averaged correlation function, so this new\nobservable provides additional cosmological information. We present the first\ndetections of the dipole signal in (i) galaxy density; (ii) CMB lensing\nconvergence; and (iii) CMB temperature -- interpreted as the ISW effect --\nusing galaxies from the SDSS-III BOSS survey and CMB maps from Planck.

    "abstract": "This paper deals with near-best approximation of a given bivariate function\nusing elements of quarkonial tensor frames. For that purpose we apply\nanisotropic tensor products of the univariate B-spline quarklets introduced\naround 2017 by Dahlke, Keding and Raasch. We introduce the concept of bivariate\nquarklet trees and develop an adaptive algorithm which allows for generalized\nhp-approximation of a given bivariate function by selected frame elements. It\nis proved that this algorithm is near-best, which means that as long as some\nstandard conditions concerning local errors are fulfilled it provides an\napproximation with an error close to that one of the best possible quarklet\ntree approximation. For this algorithm the complexity is investigated.\nMoreover, we use our techniques to approximate a bivariate test function with\ninverse-exponential rates of convergence. It can be expected that the results\npresented in this paper serve as important building block for the design of\nadaptive wavelet-hp-methods for solving PDEs in the bivariate setting with very\ngood convergence properties.",

This includes changing\nfrom top-frontal views to a side view or even more challenging from exocentric\nto egocentric views. Furthermore, we present an approach for temporal action\nsegmentation that tackles this challenge. Our approach leverages a shared\nrepresentation at both the sequence and segment levels to reduce the impact of\nview differences during training.

In this work, we introduce a novel framework,\nGAMLA (Global Analytical Manifold Learning using Auto-encoding). GAMLA employs\na two-round training process within an auto-encoding framework to derive both\ncharacter and complementary representations for the underlying manifold. With\nthe character representation, the manifold is represented by a parametric\nfunction which unfold the manifold to provide a global coordinate. While with\nthe complementary representation, an approximate explicit manifold description\nis developed, offering a global and analytical representation of smooth\nmanifolds underlying high-dimensional datasets. This enables the analytical\nderivation of geometric properties such as curvature and normal vectors.\nMoreover, we find the two representations together decompose the whole latent\nspace and can thus characterize the local spatial structure surrounding the\nmanifold, proving particularly effective in anomaly detection and\ncategorization. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and\nreal-world applications, GAMLA demonstrates its ability to achieve\ncomputational efficiency and interpretability while providing precise geometric\nand structural insights.

We\nuse data-driven radius valley constraints to establish the relationship between\nthe atmospheric surface pressures and melt temperatures of sub-Neptunes.\nSub-Neptunes with less massive rocky cores retain less of their primordial\nhydrogen envelopes, which leads to less heat retention and diminished melt\ntemperatures at the surfaces of these cores. Lower melt temperatures lead\nthermodynamically to the dominance of carbon-, oxygen-, sulfur- and\nsilicon-bearing molecules over molecular hydrogen, which naturally produce a\ndiversity of mean molecular weights.

While conventional\ncaptioning models exhibit high performance on established metrics such as BLEU,\nCIDEr, and SPICE, the capability of captions to distinguish the target image\nfrom other similar images is under-explored. To generate distinctive captions,\na few pioneers employed contrastive learning or re-weighted the ground-truth\ncaptions. However, these approaches often overlook the relationships among\nobjects in a similar image group (e.g., items or properties within the same\nalbum or fine-grained events). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to\nenhance the distinctiveness of image captions, namely Group-based Differential\nDistinctive Captioning Method, which visually compares each image with other\nimages in one similar group and highlights the uniqueness of each image. In\nparticular, we introduce a Group-based Differential Memory Attention (GDMA)\nmodule, designed to identify and emphasize object features in an image that are\nuniquely distinguishable within its image group, i.e., those exhibiting low\nsimilarity with objects in other images. This mechanism ensures that such\nunique object features are prioritized during caption generation for the image,\nthereby enhancing the distinctiveness of the resulting captions. To further\nrefine this process, we select distinctive words from the ground-truth captions\nto guide both the language decoder and the GDMA module. Additionally, we\npropose a new evaluation metric, the Distinctive Word Rate (DisWordRate), to\nquantitatively assess caption distinctiveness.

To address this\nissue in the framework of the Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System,\nthis paper proposes a global path control scheme for mobile robots based on\ndeep learning. First of all, the dynamic equation of the mobile robot is\nestablished. According to the linear velocity and angular velocity of the\nmobile robot, its motion behaviors are divided into obstacle - avoidance\nbehavior, target - turning behavior, and target approaching behavior.\nSubsequently, the neural network method in deep learning is used to build a\nglobal path planning model for the robot. On this basis, a fuzzy controller is\ndesigned with the help of a fuzzy control algorithm to correct the deviations\nthat occur during path planning, thereby achieving optimized control of the\nrobot's global path. In addition, considering edge computing optimization, the\nproposed model can process local data at the edge device, reducing the\ncommunication burden between the robot and the central server, and improving\nthe real time performance of path planning. The experimental results show that\nfor the mobile robot controlled by the research method in this paper, the\ndeviation distance of the path angle is within 5 cm, the deviation convergence\ncan be completed within 10 ms, and the planned path is shorter. This indicates\nthat the proposed scheme can effectively improve the global path planning\nability of mobile robots in the industrial Internet environment and promote the\ncollaborative operation of robots through edge computing optimization.",

We then supplement these findings with a numerical analysis to\ninform how temporal and cumulative outbreak metrics depend on the model\nparameter values for epidemic and endemic regimes. As the presented\ninterdisciplinary modelling approach can accommodate further extensions\n(including, but not limited to, adding testing capacity, decay in behavioural\neffects and multiple pathogen variants), we hope that our work will encourage\nfurther modelling studies integrating specific measured behaviours and disease\ndynamics that may reduce the health and economic impacts of future epidemics.",

In this work, we examine the role of synthetic\ndata as opposed to that of real experimental data for scientific research.

Additionally, we observe an increasing difficulty in distinguishing\nsynthetic from real experimental data.

Phased arrays like LOFAR and SKA-low are designed for this,\nbut have inherently unstable element gains, leading to time, frequency and\ndirection-dependent gain errors. Precise direction-dependent calibration of\nobservations is therefore key to reaching the highest possible dynamic range.\nMany tools for direction-dependent calibration utilise sky and beam models to\ninfer gains. However, these calibration tools struggle with precision\ncalibration for relatively bright (e.g. A-team) sources far from the beam\ncentre. Therefore, the point-spread-function of these sources can potentially\nobscure a faint signal of interest. We show that, and why, the assumption of a\nsmooth gain solution per station fails for realistic radio interferometers, and\nhow this affects gain-calibration results. Subsequently, we introduce an\nimprovement for smooth spectral gain constraints for direction-dependent\ngain-calibration algorithms, in which the level of regularisation is weighted\nby the expected station response to the sky model. We test this method using\ndirection-dependent calibration method DDECal and physically-motivated beam\nmodelling errors for LOFAR-HBA stations. The new method outperforms the\nstandard method for various calibration settings near nulls in the beam, and\nmatches the standard inverse-variance-weighted method's performance for the\nremainder of the data. The proposed method is especially effective for short\nbaselines, both in visibility and image space. Improved direction-dependent\ngain-calibration is critical for future high-precision SKA-low observations,\nwhere higher sensitivity, increased antenna beam complexity, and mutual\ncoupling call for better off-axis source subtraction, which may not be achieved\nthrough improved beam models alone.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an adaptive path planner for object search in\nagricultural fields using UAVs. The path planner uses a high-altitude coverage\nflight path and plans additional low-altitude inspections when the detection\nnetwork is uncertain. The path planner was evaluated in an offline simulation\nenvironment containing real-world images. We trained a YOLOv8 detection network\nto detect artificial plants placed in grass fields to showcase the potential of\nour path planner. We evaluated the effect of different detection certainty\nmeasures, optimized the path planning parameters, investigated the effects of\nlocalization errors, and different numbers of objects in the field. The YOLOv8\ndetection confidence worked best to differentiate between true and false\npositive detections and was therefore used in the adaptive planner. The optimal\nparameters of the path planner depended on the distribution of objects in the\nfield. When the objects were uniformly distributed, more low-altitude\ninspections were needed compared to a non-uniform distribution of objects,\nresulting in a longer path length. The adaptive planner proved to be robust\nagainst localization uncertainty. When increasing the number of objects, the\nflight path length increased, especially when the objects were uniformly\ndistributed. When the objects were non-uniformly distributed, the adaptive path\nplanner yielded a shorter path than a low-altitude coverage path, even with a\nhigh number of objects. Overall, the presented adaptive path planner allowed\nfinding non-uniformly distributed objects in a field faster than a coverage\npath planner and resulted in a compatible detection accuracy.

Over the past\ntwo decades, a common method for mapping stand borders has involved delineation\nthrough manual interpretation of stereographic aerial images. This is a\ntime-consuming and subjective process, limiting operational efficiency and\nintroducing inconsistencies. Substantial effort has been devoted to automating\nthe process, using various algorithms together with aerial images and canopy\nheight models constructed from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, but manual\ninterpretation remains the preferred method. Deep learning (DL) methods have\ndemonstrated great potential in computer vision, yet their application to\nforest stand delineation remains unexplored in published research. This study\npresents a novel approach, framing stand delineation as a multiclass\nsegmentation problem and applying a U-Net based DL framework. The model was\ntrained and evaluated using multispectral images, ALS data, and an existing\nstand map created by an expert interpreter. Performance was assessed on\nindependent data using overall accuracy, a standard metric for classification\ntasks that measures the proportions of correctly classified pixels. The model\nachieved an overall accuracy of 0.73. These results demonstrate strong\npotential for DL in automated stand delineation.

In the north and\nsouth regions, the frequency of extreme rainfalls changed, while in the center\nand east regions, the intensity of extreme rainfalls changed. Furthermore,\naccording to the return value analysis, extreme rainfalls are likely to occur\nmore frequently in the future.\n  To account for differences between locations, Gaussian Process was used to\nsmooth the results obtained using the PGEV model.

In this study, we conduct a series of\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of CME-driven star-planet systems to\ninvestigate how close-in exoplanets modulate radio burst characteristics. We\nuse a model for the stellar wind with a close-in exoplanet, and a CME model\nbased on the eruption of a flux rope. We are able to generate synthetic radio\nburst images from our MHD simulations. We find that radio burst like phenomena\nis most likely to be observed for moderately active solar like stars and\nclose-in exoplanetary systems have significant influence on the nature of radio\nburst spectrum. We find that when the exoplanet's magnetic field is relatively\nweak, its magnetosphere compresses the CME plasma, increasing local density and\nshifting the radio emission to higher frequencies. Conversely, a strong\nplanetary magnetic field results in a large magnetosphere that prevents\neffective CME-shock development, producing weaker radio emission concentrated\nat lower frequencies, particularly at the flanks of the CME. For highly active\nsolar-like stars, strong overlying stellar magnetic fields suppress the CME\nshock, greatly diminishing radio burst visibility. For HD 189733 (moderate\nstellar field), only intensity difference is visible when the CME arrives the\nplanet. We also do not find significant modulation in the radio emission by a\nclose-in exoplanet system when the stellar magnetic field is complex.

Despite its simplicity, LiDAR captures only the near\nside of objects, making center-based detectors prone to poor localization\naccuracy in cross-domain tasks with varying point distributions. Meanwhile,\nexisting evaluation metrics designed for single-domain assessment also suffer\nfrom overfitting due to dataset-specific size variations. A key question\narises: Do we really need models to maintain excellent performance in the\nentire 3D bounding boxes after being applied across domains? Actually, one of\nour main focuses is on preventing collisions between vehicles and other\nobstacles, especially in cross-domain scenarios where correctly predicting the\nsizes is much more difficult. To address these issues, we rethink cross-domain\n3D object detection from a practical perspective. We propose two new metrics\nthat evaluate a model's ability to detect objects' closer-surfaces to the LiDAR\nsensor. Additionally, we introduce EdgeHead, a refinement head that guides\nmodels to focus more on learnable closer surfaces, significantly improving\ncross-domain performance under both our new and traditional BEV/3D metrics.\nFurthermore, we argue that predicting the nearest corner rather than the object\ncenter enhances robustness. We propose a novel 3D object detector, coined as\nCornerPoint3D, which is built upon CenterPoint and uses heatmaps to supervise\nthe learning and detection of the nearest corner of each object. Our proposed\nmethods realize a balanced trade-off between the detection quality of entire\nbounding boxes and the locating accuracy of closer surfaces to the LiDAR\nsensor, outperforming the traditional center-based detector CenterPoint in\nmultiple cross-domain tasks and providing a more practically reasonable and\nrobust cross-domain 3D object detection solution.",

    "abstract": "Current fairness metrics and mitigation techniques provide tools for\npractitioners to asses how non-discriminatory Automatic Decision Making (ADM)\nsystems are. What if I, as an individual facing a decision taken by an ADM\nsystem, would like to know: Am I being treated fairly? We explore how to create\nthe affordance for users to be able to ask this question of ADM. In this paper,\nwe argue for the reification of fairness not only as a property of ADM, but\nalso as an epistemic right of an individual to acquire information about the\ndecisions that affect them and use that information to contest and seek\neffective redress against those decisions, in case they are proven to be\ndiscriminatory. We examine key concepts from existing research not only in\nalgorithmic fairness but also in explainable artificial intelligence,\naccountability, and contestability. Integrating notions from these domains, we\npropose a conceptual framework to ascertain fairness by combining different\ntools that empower the end-users of ADM systems. Our framework shifts the focus\nfrom technical solutions aimed at practitioners to mechanisms that enable\nindividuals to understand, challenge, and verify the fairness of decisions, and\nalso serves as a blueprint for organizations and policymakers, bridging the gap\nbetween technical requirements and practical, user-centered accountability.",

Through exact diagonalization for small systems\nand tensor-network methods for larger chains, we demonstrate that the\nsteady-state current remains finite and decays exponentially with disorder\nstrength, showing no evidence of a transition up to disorder values far beyond\nthe previously claimed critical point. Our results reveal a stark discrepancy\nbetween spectral indicators, which suggest localization, and transport\nbehavior, which indicates delocalization. This highlights the importance of\ndynamical observables in characterizing NH MBL and suggests that traditional\nspectral measures may not fully capture the physics of non-Hermitian systems.\n  Additionally, we observe a non-commutativity of limits in system size and\ntime, further complicating the interpretation of finite-size studies.

We propose a physics-informed encoder-decoder network to\nestablish the mapping between continuous parameter and solution spaces. The\ndecoder constructs the parametric solution field by leveraging an implicit\nneural field network conditioned on a latent or feature code. Instance-specific\ncodes are derived through a PDE encoding process based on the second-order\nmeta-learning technique. In training and inference, a physics-informed loss\nfunction is minimized during the PDE encoding and decoding. iFOL expresses the\nloss function in an energy or weighted residual form and evaluates it using\ndiscrete residuals derived from standard numerical PDE methods. This approach\nresults in the backpropagation of discrete residuals during both training and\ninference.\n  iFOL features several key properties: (1) its unique loss formulation\neliminates the need for the conventional encode-process-decode pipeline\npreviously used in operator learning with conditional neural fields for PDEs;\n(2) it not only provides accurate parametric and continuous fields but also\ndelivers solution-to-parameter gradients without requiring additional loss\nterms or sensitivity analysis; (3) it can effectively capture sharp\ndiscontinuities in the solution; and (4) it removes constraints on the geometry\nand mesh, making it applicable to arbitrary geometries and spatial sampling\n(zero-shot super-resolution capability).

To mitigate\nthe negative impact of such vulnerabilities, one potential solution is to\nemploy collaborative signals based on item-item co-occurrence to purify the\nmalicious collaborative knowledge from the user's historical interactions\ninserted by attackers. On the other hand, due to the capabilities to expand\ninsufficient internal knowledge of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\ntechniques provide unprecedented opportunities to enhance the robustness of\nLLM-empowered recommender systems by introducing external collaborative\nknowledge.

This\npaper investigates when these predictions (scores) can effectively rank\nindividuals by their intervention effects, particularly when direct effect\nestimation is infeasible or unreliable. We propose a conceptual framework based\non amenability: an individual's latent proclivity to be influenced by an\nintervention. We then formalize conditions under which predictive scores serve\nas effective proxies for amenability. These conditions justify using non-causal\nscores for intervention prioritization, even when the scores do not directly\nestimate effects. We further show that, under plausible assumptions, predictive\nmodels can outperform causal effect estimators in ranking individuals by\nintervention effects. Empirical evidence from an advertising context supports\nour theoretical findings, demonstrating that predictive modeling can offer a\nmore robust approach to targeting than effect estimation.

    "abstract": "Distributed peer-to-peer systems are widely popular due to their\ndecentralized nature, which ensures that no peer is critical for the\nfunctionality of the system. However, fully decentralized solutions are usually\nmuch harder to design, and tend to have a much higher overhead compared to\ncentralized approaches, where the peers are connected to a powerful server. On\nthe other hand, centralized approaches have a single point of failure. Thus, is\nthere some way to combine their advantages without inheriting their\ndisadvantages? To that end, we consider a supervised peer-to-peer approach\nwhere the peers can ask a potentially unreliable supervisor for advice. This is\nin line with the increasingly popular algorithmic paradigm called algorithms\nwith predictions or learning-augmented algorithms, but we are the first to\nconsider it in the context of peer-to-peer networks.\n  Specifically, we design self-stabilizing algorithms for the fundamental\nproblem of distributed graph linearization, where peers are supposed to recover\nthe \"sorted line\" network from any initial network after a transient fault.\nWith the help of the supervisor, peers can recover the sorted line network in\n$O(\\log n)$ time, if the advice is correct; otherwise, the algorithm retains\nits original recovery time (i.e., without any supervisor). A crucial challenge\nthat we overcome is to correctly compose multiple self-stabilizing algorithms,\nthat is, one that processes and exploits the advice, and another that does not\nrely on the advice at all. Our key technical contributions combine ideas from\nthe fields of overlay networks and proof-labeling schemes. Finally, we give a\nmatching lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log n)$ for the recovery time of any algorithm\nif the advice can be corrupted, where $n$ is the network size.",

The\nintroduction of recursive common table expressions (CTEs) using the WITH\nRECURSIVE keyword in SQL:1999 extended the ability of relational database\nsystems to handle fixed-point computations, unlocking significant performance\nadvantages by allowing computation to move closer to the data. Yet with\nrecursion, SQL becomes a Turing-complete programming language and, with that,\nunrecoverable safety and correctness risks. SQL itself lacks a fixed semantics,\nas the SQL specification is written in natural language, full of ambiguities\nthat database vendors resolve in divergent ways. As a result, reasoning about\nthe correctness of recursive SQL programs must rely on isolated mathematical\nproperties of queries rather than wrestling a unified formal model out of a\nlanguage with notoriously inconsistent semantics. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a calculus that automatically derives mathematical properties from\nembedded recursive queries and, depending on the database backend, rejects\nqueries that may lead to the three classes of recursive query errors - database\nerrors, incorrect results, and non-termination. We introduce TyQL, a practical\nimplementation in Scala for safe, recursive language-integrated query.

This deviates from the\nprinciple of perceptual organization that emphasizes the local groups and\noverall topology of visual elements.

Specifically, we propose a\ntopology-aware vision transformer called HyperGraph Transformer (HGFormer).\nFirstly, we present a Center Sampling K-Nearest Neighbors (CS-KNN) algorithm\nfor semantic guidance during hypergraph construction. Secondly, we present a\ntopology-aware HyperGraph Attention (HGA) mechanism that integrates hypergraph\ntopology as perceptual indications to guide the aggregation of global and\nunbiased information during hypergraph messaging. Using HGFormer as visual\nbackbone, we develop an effective and unitive representation, achieving\ndistinct and detailed scene depictions.

Our framework adopts a dual-branch diffusion\ntransformer (DiT) architecture, with one branch dedicated to audio generation\nand the other to video synthesis. At the shallow layers, cross-modal fusion\nmodules are introduced to integrate information between the two modalities. In\ndeeper layers, each modality is processed independently, with the generated\naudio decoded by a vocoder and the video rendered using a GAN-based\nhigh-quality visual renderer. Leveraging the in-context learning capability of\nDiT through a masked-infilling strategy, our model can simultaneously capture\nboth audio and visual styles without requiring explicit style extraction\nmodules. Thanks to the efficiency of the DiT backbone and the optimized visual\nrenderer, OmniTalker achieves real-time inference at 25 FPS. To the best of our\nknowledge, OmniTalker is the first one-shot framework capable of jointly\nmodeling speech and facial styles in real time. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate its superiority over existing methods in terms of generation\nquality, particularly in preserving style consistency and ensuring precise\naudio-video synchronization, all while maintaining efficient inference.",

    "abstract": "Robust low-rank approximation under row-wise adversarial corruption can be\nachieved with a single pass, randomized procedure that detects and removes\noutlier rows by thresholding their projected norms. We propose a scalable,\nnon-iterative algorithm that efficiently recovers the underlying low-rank\nstructure in the presence of row-wise adversarial corruption. By first\ncompressing the data with a Johnson Lindenstrauss projection, our approach\npreserves the geometry of clean rows while dramatically reducing\ndimensionality. Robust statistical techniques based on the median and median\nabsolute deviation then enable precise identification and removal of outlier\nrows with abnormally high norms. The subsequent rank-k approximation achieves\nnear-optimal error bounds with a one pass procedure that scales linearly with\nthe number of observations. Empirical results confirm that combining random\nsketches with robust statistics yields efficient, accurate decompositions even\nin the presence of large fractions of corrupted rows.",

In\nthis work, we rigorously determine the relationship between the mechanical\n(bending) properties of the filament and the viscous thrust it produces using\nmathematical optimisation. Specifically, by considering a model system (a\nslender elastic filament with an oscillating slope at its base), we derive the\noptimal bending rigidity function along the filament that maximises the\ntime-averaged thrust produced by the actuated filament. Instead of prescribing\na specific functional form, we use functional optimisation and adjoint-based\nvariational calculus to formally establish the link between the distribution of\nbending rigidity and propulsion. The optimal rigidities are found to be stiff\nnear the base, and soft near the distal end, with a spatial distribution that\ndepends critically on the constraints used in the optimisation procedure.

As the yield stress increases, the attractive\ninteraction is replaced by stasis at short distance, characterized by a\nvanishing relative velocity and the formation of an unyielded region that\nconnects the two spheres, where the fluid behaves like a viscoelastic solid.\nAdditionally, the combined effects of plasticity and elasticity enhance the\nrepulsion between the particles, promoting their ordering. Also increasing the\nconfinement of the particles enhances repulsion, thus allowing to achieve\nordering within shorter lengths in the flow direction. Reducing shear thinning\namplifies peak relative velocities and expands the attractive region due to\nincreased viscoelastic stresses and stress gradients. While a stable\nequilibrium may appear at larger separations, its impact is limited by low\nrelative velocities.",

The\nintra-type message passing reasoning model captures the neighborhood\ninformation of targets and relationships related to the question in the dual\ngraph, updating the dual graph to obtain intra-type clues for answering the\nquestion. The inter-type message passing reasoning model captures the\nneighborhood information of targets and relationships from different categories\nrelated to the question in the heterogeneous graph, updating the heterogeneous\ngraph to obtain inter-type clues for answering the question.

This area holds significant promise for\npractical applications; however, progress has been limited by a notable\nscarcity of dedicated datasets and methodologies. To bridge this gap and\nstimulate further research, we introduce the first HRSI-SOD dataset, termed\nHRSSD, which includes 704 hyperspectral images and 5327 pixel-level annotated\nsalient objects. The HRSSD dataset poses substantial challenges for salient\nobject detection algorithms due to large scale variation, diverse\nforeground-background relations, and multi-salient objects. Additionally, we\npropose an innovative and efficient baseline model for HRSI-SOD, termed the\nDeep Spectral Saliency Network (DSSN). The core of DSSN is the Cross-level\nSaliency Assessment Block, which performs pixel-wise attention and evaluates\nthe contributions of multi-scale similarity maps at each spatial location,\neffectively reducing erroneous responses in cluttered regions and emphasizes\nsalient regions across scales. Additionally, the High-resolution Fusion Module\ncombines bottom-up fusion strategy and learned spatial upsampling to leverage\nthe strengths of multi-scale saliency maps, ensuring accurate localization of\nsmall objects. Experiments on the HRSSD dataset robustly validate the\nsuperiority of DSSN, underscoring the critical need for specialized datasets\nand methodologies in this domain.

We present\nspatiotemporal characteristics of QPPs of an X2.8 two-ribbon solar WLF\n(SOL2023-12-14T17:02), which was well observed by the White-light Solar\nTelescope (WST) aboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory, with\nhigh-cadence imaging (1--2 s) in the Balmer continuum at 3600 \\AA. Combined\nwith additional multi-instrument data, we find that the enhancement of the WLF\nin both Balmer and Paschen continua shows strong spatiotemporal correlation\nwith hard X-ray (HXR) emissions. Notably, the pulses in the WST Balmer\ncontinuum exhibited a near-zero time lag with most HXR pulses, whereas soft\nX-ray and extreme ultraviolet emissions showed a lag of 2--3 s. Interestingly,\nquasi-harmonic QPPs with periods of $\\sim$11 s and $\\sim$20 s were observed in\nmultiple wavelengths in the rising phase of the white-light continuum.\nFurthermore, we employed Fourier transform to spatially locate the QPPs around\n11 and 20 s, revealing that they primarily originated from the east flare\nribbon, which exhibited the most substantial continuum enhancement. More\ninterestingly, we find that the west ribbon contributed significantly to the\n11-second QPP but had a weaker contribution to the 20-second QPP. Moreover, the\noccurrence of quasi-harmonic QPPs is temporally coincident with the rapid\nelongation and separation motions of flare ribbons. Possible mechanisms for the\nquasi-harmonic QPPs have been discussed. These observations provide valuable\ninsights into QPP modeling for solar and stellar flares.",

In\ncontrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers superior image quality and\ntissue differentiation but is less available, expensive, and requires\ntime-consuming acquisition. Thus, transforming ultrasonic images into an\nMRI-mimicking display may be advantageous and allow better tissue anatomy\npresentation. To address this goal, we have examined the use of artificial\nintelligence, implementing a diffusion model renowned for generating\nhigh-quality images. The proposed method, termed \"Dual Diffusion Imposed\nCorrelation\" (DDIC), leverages a diffusion-based translation methodology,\nassuming a shared latent space between ultrasound and MRI domains. Model\ntraining was obtained utilizing the \"HC18\" dataset for ultrasound and the \"CRL\nfetal brain atlas\" along with the \"FeTA \" datasets for MRI. The generated\npseudo-MRI images provide notable improvements in visual discrimination of\nbrain tissue, especially in the lateral ventricles and the Sylvian fissure,\ncharacterized by enhanced contrast clarity. Improvement was demonstrated in\nMutual information, Peak signal-to-noise ratio, Fr\\'echet Inception Distance,\nand Contrast-to-noise ratio.

The\npurpose of this paper is to develop in more detail the theory of Kleene wands\nand itegories.\n  A Kleene wand is a binary operator which takes in two disjoint partial maps,\nan endomorphism ${X \\to X}$ and a map ${X \\to A}$ and produces a partial map $X\n\\to A$. This latter map is interpreted as iterating the endomorphism until it\nlands in the domain of definition of the second map.

For extensive restriction categories, we explain in detail how\nhaving a Kleene wand is equivalent to this standard interpretation of\niteration. This suggests that Kleene wands can be used to replace parametrized\niteration and traces in restriction categories which lack coproducts. Further\nevidence of this is exhibited by providing a matrix construction which embeds\nan itegory into a traced extensive restriction category.

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to play a key role in 6G networks\nincluding optimising system management, operation, and evolution. This requires\nsystematic lifecycle management of AI models, ensuring their impact on services\nand stakeholders is continuously monitored. While current 6G initiatives\nintroduce AI, they often fall short in addressing end-to-end intelligence and\ncrucial aspects like trust, transparency, privacy, and verifiability.\nTrustworthy AI is vital, especially for critical infrastructures like 6G. This\npaper introduces the REASON approach for holistically addressing AI's native\nintegration and trustworthiness in future 6G networks. The approach comprises\nAI Orchestration (AIO) for model lifecycle management, Cognition (COG) for\nperformance evaluation and explanation, and AI Monitoring (AIM) for tracking\nand feedback. Digital Twin (DT) technology is leveraged to facilitate real-time\nmonitoring and scenario testing, which are essential for AIO, COG, and AIM. We\ndemonstrate this approach through an AI-enabled xAPP use case, leveraging a DT\nplatform to validate, explain, and deploy trustworthy AI models.",

    "abstract": "SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information\nprocessing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection\nefficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further\nimproving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for\noptimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a\npowerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, we\nstudied the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN\nSNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance\nas a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from\n127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at\napproximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation\ntime measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps, while the\nelectron-phonon interaction time extends by 14%, from 11.2 to 12.8 ps at 10 K.\nTEM reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble\nformation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended\nthermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key\nrole in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. We further demonstrate a\npost-irradiation SNSPD showing a saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to\n28 mK, enabled by thermal modifications and a weakly wavelength-dependent\navalanche-assisted mechanism. Our findings highlight ion irradiation as a\nvaluable tool for thermal tailoring in SNSPDs and advance the understanding of\ndetection physics and defect engineering in superconducting optoelectronics.",

Recent\nadvances in event camera hardware show good potential for its application in\nvisual sound recovery, because of its superior ability in capturing\nhigh-frequency signals. However, existing event-based vibration recovery\nmethods are still sub-optimal for sound recovery. In this work, we propose a\nnovel pipeline for non-contact sound recovery, fully utilizing spatial-temporal\ninformation from the event stream.

Lastly, we train a spatial aggregation block to\naggregate information from different locations to further improve signal\nquality. To capture event signals caused by sound waves, we also designed an\nimaging system using a laser matrix to enhance the gradient and collected\nmultiple data sequences for testing.

Stellar surveys by Kepler and TESS, however, revealed that Sun-like\nstars tend to show much stronger flare activity than the Sun. This study aims\nto reassess observed flare and spot activity of Sun-like Kepler stars by\nfine-tuning the criteria for a more robust definition of Sun-like conditions\nand better comparability between the current Sun and Sun-like stars. We update\none of the recent stellar Sun-like star samples by applying new empirical\nstellar relations between the starspot size and the effective stellar\ntemperature to derive more reliable starspot group sizes. From the 265\nsolar-type stars, we could select 48 stars supporting the Kepler 30-minute\ncadence light curves. These were analyzed by implementing the gradient of the\npower spectra method to distinguish between spot- and faculae-dominated stars.\nWe employed the $\\alpha$-factor to quantify the area ratio of bright and dark\nfeatures on the stellar surface. We were able to group the 48 stars as being\nspot- or faculae-dominated, revealing a preferential distribution of the Kepler\nSun-like stars towards the spot-dominated (44 stars) and transitional (four\nstars) regimes. As the current Sun is faculae-dominated, only the transitional\nstars were utilized for further evaluation. Additionally, accounting for\ncomparability in stellar mass, radius, and rotation period, we show that only\none of the utilized 265 Sun-like stars in the Kepler sample (i.e., KIC\n11599385) allows for direct comparison to the current Sun. We further show that\nthe single flare observed on KIC 11599385 falls right within the flare energy\nrange estimated for the AD774/775 event observed in the cosmogenic radionuclide\narchives of $^{10}$Be, $^{14}$C, and $^{36}$Cl.",

    "abstract": "The symbiotic relationship between the frameworks of classical game theory\nand evolutionary game theory is well-established. However, evolutionary game\ntheorists have mostly tapped into the classical game of complete information\nwhere players are completely informed of all other players' payoffs. Of late,\nthere is a surge of interest in eco-evolutionary interactions where the\nenvironment's state is changed by the players' actions which, in turn, are\ninfluenced by the changing environment. However, in real life, the information\nabout the true environmental state must pass through some noisy channel (like\nusually imperfect sensory apparatus of the players) before it is perceived by\nthe players: The players naturally are prone to sometimes perceive the true\nstate erroneously. Given the uncertain perceived environment, the players may\nadopt bet-hedging kind of strategies in which they play different actions in\ndifferent perceptions. In a population of such ill-informed players, a player\nwould be confused about the information state of her opponent, and an\nincomplete information situation akin to a Bayesian game surfaces. In short, we\ncontemplate possibility of natural emergence of symbiotic relationship between\nthe frameworks of Bayesian games and eco-evolutionary games when the players\nare equipped with inefficient sensory apparatus. Herein, we illustrate this\nconnection using a setup of infinitely large, well-mixed population of players\nequipped with two actions for exploiting a resource (the environment) at two\ndifferent rates so that the resource state evolves accordingly. The state of\nthe resource impacts every player's decision of playing particular action. We\ninvestigate continuous state environment in the presence of a Gaussian noisy\nchannel. Employing the formalism of replicator dynamics, we find that noisy\ninformation can be effective in preventing resource from going extinct.",

In this paper, we use\nthe Random Forest (RF) in combination with the evolutionary grid from PARSEC\n1.2S to determine $M$, $L$, $t$ and initial mass ($M_{\\rm i}$) for early-type\nmain-sequence stars ($T_{\\rm eff}\\geq 7,000\\ {\\rm K}$) as identified from the\nLAMOST survey. The convex hull algorithm is employed to select the\nmain-sequence stars. The results demonstrate that the prediction precision is\n$32\\%$ and $9\\%$ for $L$ and $M$, respectively, which is comparable to that\nachieved by fitting evolutionary tracks. Furthermore, the predicted $L$ also\naligns with Gaia's observations, with a relative difference of $36\\%$. The\nprediction for $t$ is relatively less accurate, indicating a difference of 0.44\nGyr for two components in wide binaries. This discrepancy is due to the\ninconsistent metallicity measurements. For the two sets of atmospheric\nparameters we used, the relative differences in $L$, $M$, $t$ and $M_{\\rm i}$\nare $29\\%$, $7\\%$, $36\\%$ and $7\\%$, respectively. The influence of metallicity\non these parameters is analyzed, with the conclusion that metallicity has the\ngreatest impact on $t$.

It is not clear how nuclei bound\nby a few MeV can emerge in environments characterized by temperatures above 100\nMeV [3-5], about 100,000 times hotter than the center of the Sun. Despite\nextensive studies, this question remained unanswered. The ALICE Collaboration\nnow addresses it with a novel approach using deuteron-pion momentum\ncorrelations in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC). Our results provide model-independent evidence that about 80% of the\nobserved (anti)deuterons are produced in nuclear fusion reactions [6] following\nthe decay of short-lived resonances, such as the $\\Delta (1232)$. These\nfindings resolve a crucial gap in our understanding of nucleosynthesis in\nhadronic collisions. Beyond answering the fundamental question on how nuclei\nare formed in hadronic collisions, the results can be employed in the modeling\nof the production of light and heavy nuclei in cosmic rays [7] and dark matter\ndecays [8,9].",

At present, we have no objective method of deciding whether the\nparameters of the observed meteoroid stream represent a further solution to an\nalready known object or whether they relate to a new discovery. As result, the\nMeteor Data Center (MDC) database of the International Astronomical Union (IAU)\ncontains duplicates and false duplicates of the meteor showers.\n  It is desirable to detect questionable cases and, if possible, correct their\nstatus, thereby contributing to the improvement of the content of the IAU MDC\ndatabase. The correct content of the MDC database is important in its\napplications, for example, in assessing the threat from meteoroids to Earth's\nartificial satellites.\n  Two approaches were used, in the first the internal compatibility of\ngeocentric and heliocentric parameters representing a given flux was verified.\nIn the second, a comparison of two or more solutions of the same stream was\nmade in as much detail as possible. Fifty-six streams were verified, for which\nclear suspicion of misclassification was established in our earlier work.\n  For 43 streams, the misclassification was confirmed, with a proposal to\nchange their status in the MDC to autonomous. In the remaining 13 cases, it was\nproposed to leave their status unchanged.\n  Although we do not consider it 'definitive', our study clearly shows that\nrepeated misclassification of new meteoroid flux solutions has occurred in the\npast. Correction of these cases will significantly improve the content of the\nMDC database. As an additional product, based on the approach proposed in this\nand our earlier work, relevant procedures have been proposed, which, available\non the MDC database website, will make it possible to compare new meteoroid\ndata with the contents of the database, thereby avoiding errors in their\nclassification.",

To further refine\nthe segmentation of fine-grained structures in unique marine organisms, we\ndevelop the dedicated consensus deterministic sampling to suppress\noverconfident missegmentations.

The analysis results show that the inserted MoS2 layer\ndoes not change the main transmission mechanism (space charge limited\nconduction) of the device, but affects the regulating function of interfacial\npotential barrier, the effect also is related to the location of MoS2 inserted\ninto the layer.

To address this challenge, paper recommendation systems have been\ndeveloped to help researchers in effectively identifying relevant paper. One of\nthe leading approaches to paper recommendation is content-based filtering\nmethod. Traditional content-based filtering methods recommend relevant papers\nto users based on the overall similarity of papers. However, these approaches\ndo not take into account the information seeking behaviors that users commonly\nemploy when searching for literature. Such behaviors include not only\nevaluating the overall similarity among papers, but also focusing on specific\nsections, such as the method section, to ensure that the approach aligns with\nthe user's interests. In this paper, we propose a content-based filtering\nrecommendation method that takes this information seeking behavior into\naccount. Specifically, in addition to considering the overall content of a\npaper, our approach also takes into account three specific sections\n(background, method, and results) and assigns weights to them to better reflect\nuser preferences.

Holding the promise of attaining\nbandwidth-efficient collision resolution, multiaccess reservation no doubt\nplays a central role in RMA, e.g., the distributed coordination function (DCF)\nin IEEE 802.11. In this paper, we are interested in maximizing the bandwidth\nefficiency of reservation protocols for RMA under quality-of-service\nconstraints.

More importantly, it\nsubstantially reduces the reservation bandwidth determined by the communication\ncomplexity of DCF, through judiciously conceived coding and interaction for\nexchanging information required by distributed ordering.

    "abstract": "In a previous article, we discussed a paradox in Timaeus' cosmology: that\nthere is no void inside the universe, even though it is entirely filled with\npolyhedra-a mathematical impossibility (Brisson-Ofman 2025). In the present\narticle, we examine another paradox. While the first paradox is well known and\nwas already highlighted by Aristotle as a fundamental mathematical\ncontradiction undermining Plato's cosmology, this new paradox has gone almost\nentirely unnoticed by commentators, both ancient and modern. This oversight may\nsurprise scholars, given the extensive body of work on Timaeus' universe, much\nof which emphasizes discrepancies with astronomical observations or points out\nsupposed internal contradictions. Like the first paradox, this one arises from\nthe premise of a universe entirely filled with polyhedra. However, in this\ncase, the contradiction stems from the absence of void outside it. In the first\nsection, we demonstrate that the shape of the universe cannot be a perfect\nmathematical sphere: that is, its boundary is not smooth but exhibits bumps and\nhollows. Next, we present conceptual arguments from Plato's text that support\nthe necessity of such 'defects' in the universe's shape compared to a perfect\nmathematical sphere. In the third section, we argue that such a universe cannot\nmove at all. Finally, we propose a solution to this mathematical contradiction\nin Timaeus' construction, drawing on the same ideas used to address the earlier\napparent contradiction: the unique feature of Timaeus' universe as a living\nbeing, whose parts are continuously moving, changing, decomposing, and\nreforming. While this problem does not depend on the various schools of\ninterpretation of the Timaeus, it is related to some important issues\nconcerning Plato's philosophy. These issues include the importance of\nobservations in science-particularly in astronomy-the relationship between\nintelligible models and their sensible copies, the mythos/ logos approach of\nPlato's cosmology, and the debate over 'metaphorical' vs 'literal'\ninterpretation. Of course, all these questions fall outside the scope of this\narticle and will not be addressed here.",

In the effective CV network, however, many\nof the unique properties of complex networks, such as small-worldness and the\npresence of hubs, are lost due to the fast decay of the key rate with physical\ndistance for CV systems.

With the\nhelp of this approximation, we explicitly introduce an ionic structure factor\ninto the Ziman formula, without resorting to the Born approximation. Both\napproaches involve the calculation of scattering phase shifts, which we\nintegrate from Calogero equation with an adaptive step numerical scheme based\non a Runge-Kutta-Merson solver. We show that if the atomic number $Z$ is not\ntoo large, integrating the phase shifts in this way is more time-efficient than\nusing a classical Numerov-type scheme to solve the radial Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. Various approximations are explored for phase shifts to further\nimprove computation time. For the Born approximation, we show that using Born\nphase shifts directly in the scattering cross-section gives more accurate\nresults than with the integral formula based on the Fourier transform of the\nelectron-ion potential.

Post-hoc\ninterpretability has gained popularity due to its ability to preserve network\nflexibility and scalability without modifying model structures. However, these\nmethods often yield suboptimal time-domain explanations. Recently, combining\ndomain transform with SHAP has improved interpretability by extending\nexplanations to more informative domains. Nonetheless, the computational\nexpense of SHAP, exacerbated by increased dimensions from domain transforms,\nremains a major challenge. To address this, we propose patch-wise attribution\nand SHapley Estimated Explanation (SHEP). Patch-wise attribution reduces\nfeature dimensions at the cost of explanation granularity, while SHEP\nsimplifies subset enumeration to approximate SHAP, reducing complexity from\nexponential to linear. Together, these methods significantly enhance SHAP's\ncomputational efficiency, providing feasibility for real-time interpretation in\nmonitoring tasks. Extensive experiments confirm SHEP's efficiency,\ninterpretability, and reliability in approximating SHAP.

    "abstract": "Respiratory diseases account for a significant portion of global mortality.\nAffordable and early detection is an effective way of addressing these\nailments. To this end, a low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), IEEE\n802.15.4z standard compliant impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar system\nis exploited to estimate human respiration rates. We propose a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) to predict breathing rates from ultra-wideband (UWB)\nchannel impulse response (CIR) data, and compare its performance with other\nrule-based algorithms. The study uses a diverse dataset of 16 individuals,\nincorporating various real-life environments to evaluate system robustness.\nResults show that the CNN achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.73 breaths\nper minute (BPM) in unseen situations, significantly outperforming rule-based\nmethods (3.40 BPM). By incorporating calibration data from other individuals in\nthe unseen situations, the error is further reduced to 0.84 BPM. In addition,\nthis work evaluates the feasibility of running the pipeline on a low-cost\nembedded device. Applying 8-bit quantization to both the weights and\ninput/ouput tensors, reduces memory requirements by 67% and inference time by\n64% with only a 3% increase in MAE. As a result, we show it is feasible to\ndeploy the algorithm on an nRF52840 system-on-chip (SoC) requiring only 46 KB\nof memory and operating with an inference time of only 192 ms. Once deployed,\nthe system can last up to 268 days without recharging using a 20 000 mAh\nbattery pack. For breathing monitoring in bed, the sampling rate can be\nlowered, extending battery life to 313 days, making the solution highly\nefficient for real-world, low-cost deployments.",

To address the above issue, we decompose\nlow-light image enhancement into a recursive enhancement task and propose a\nbrightness-perceiving-based recursive enhancement framework for high dynamic\nrange low-light image enhancement. Specifically, our recursive enhancement\nframework consists of two parallel sub-networks: Adaptive Contrast and Texture\nenhancement network (ACT-Net) and Brightness Perception network (BP-Net). The\nACT-Net is proposed to adaptively enhance image contrast and details under the\nguidance of the brightness adjustment branch and gradient adjustment branch,\nwhich are proposed to perceive the degradation degree of contrast and details\nin low-light images. To adaptively enhance images captured under different\nbrightness levels, BP-Net is proposed to control the recursive enhancement\ntimes of ACT-Net by exploring the image brightness distribution properties.\nFinally, in order to coordinate ACT-Net and BP-Net, we design a novel\nunsupervised training strategy to facilitate the training procedure. To further\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we construct a new dataset\nwith a broader brightness distribution by mixing three low-light datasets.\nCompared with eleven existing representative methods, the proposed method\nachieves new SOTA performance on six reference and no reference metrics.\nSpecifically, the proposed method improves the PSNR by 0.9 dB compared to the\nexisting SOTA method.",

Recognizing that many apps share similar\nfunctionalities, researchers have proposed various techniques to migrate GUI\ntests from one app to another with similar features. For example, some\ntechniques employ mapping-based approaches to align the GUI elements traversed\nby the tests of a source app to those present in the target app. Other test\nmigration techniques have also been proposed to leverage large language models\n(LLMs) by adapting the GUI tasks in source tests.

Then we unveil the opportunities that LNNs bring to future wireless\nnetworks. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and design directions for the\nimplementation of LNNs. Finally, we summarize the performance of LNNs in two\ncase studies.",

When the\nVQE-optimized state closely approximates the true ground state in the active\nspace, excitations cannot act solely in the active space, since their\ncontributions to perturbative correction are negligible. This reduces the\nhighest-order required RDM from 4-RDM to 3-RDM, significantly reducing\ncomputational costs.

We specifically investigated TESS observations of Teegarden's star,\nwhich showed two very large flares with an estimated flare fluence between\n10$^{29}$ and 10$^{32}$\\,erg comparable to the largest solar flares. We\nfurthermore analysed nearly 300 CARMENES spectra and 11 ESPRESSO spectra\ncovering all the usually used chromospheric lines in the optical from the\n\\ion{Ca}{ii} H \\& K lines at 3930\\,\\AA\\, to the \\ion{He}{i} infrared triplet at\n10830\\,\\AA. These lines show different behaviour: The \\ion{He}{i} infrared\ntriplet is the only one absent in all spectra, some lines show up only during\nflares, and others are always present and highly variable. Specifically, the\nH$\\alpha$ line is more or less filled in during quiescence; however, the higher\nBalmer lines are still observed in emission. Many chromospheric lines show a\ncorrelation with H$\\alpha$ variability, which, in addition to stochastic\nbehaviour, also shows systematic behaviour on different timescales including\nthe rotation period. Moreover, we found several flares and also report hints of\nan erupting prominence, which may have led to a coronal mass ejection. Finally,\nwe present X-ray observations of Teegarden's star (i.e. a discovery pointing\nobtained with the \\emph{Chandra} observatory) and an extensive study with the\n\\emph{XMM-Newton} observatory; when these two large flares were observed, one\nof them showed clear signatures of the Neupert effect, suggesting the\nproduction of hard X-rays in the system.",

The success of NeRF-based generative\nmethods indicates a promising direction to address this challenge. However,\nunlike their success at the object level, existing scene-level generative\nmethods require additional information, such as multiple views, depth images,\nor semantic guidance, rather than relying solely on RGB images. This is because\nNeRF-based methods necessitate prior knowledge of camera poses, which is\nchallenging to approximate for indoor scenes due to the complexity of defining\nalignment and the difficulty of globally estimating poses from a single image,\ngiven the unseen parts behind the camera. To address this challenge, we\nredefine global poses within the framework of Local-Pose-Alignment (LPA) -- an\nanchor-based multi-local-coordinate system that uses a selected number of\nanchors as the roots of these coordinates. Building on this foundation, we\nintroduce LPA-GAN, a novel NeRF-based generative approach that incorporates\nspecific modifications to estimate the priors of camera poses under LPA. It\nalso co-optimizes the pose predictor and scene generation processes. Our\nablation study and comparisons with straightforward extensions of NeRF-based\nobject generative methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\nFurthermore, visual comparisons with other techniques reveal that our method\nachieves superior view-to-view consistency and semantic normality.",

Here, we\ndevelop a theoretical framework and propose a metric to quantify the stability\nof complex communities characterized by non-overlapping generations and diverse\ninteraction types. In stark contrast to existing results for overlapping\ngenerations, we find that increasing self-regulation strength first stabilizes\nand then destabilizes complex communities.

Moreover, we show that communities with diverse\ninteraction types become the most stable, which is corroborated by empirical\nmouse microbial networks.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to assist\nteachers and support student learning. While researchers have explored various\nprompt engineering approaches in educational contexts, the degree to which\nthese approaches generalize across domains--such as science, computing, and\nengineering--remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce\nChain-of-Thought Prompting + Active Learning (CoTAL), an LLM-based approach to\nformative assessment scoring that (1) leverages Evidence-Centered Design (ECD)\nto align assessments and rubrics with curriculum goals, (2) applies\nhuman-in-the-loop prompt engineering to automate response scoring, and (3)\nincorporates chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and teacher and student feedback\nto iteratively refine questions, rubrics, and LLM prompts. Our findings\ndemonstrate that CoTAL improves GPT-4's scoring performance across domains,\nachieving gains of up to 38.9% over a non-prompt-engineered baseline (i.e.,\nwithout labeled examples, chain-of-thought prompting, or iterative refinement).\nTeachers and students judge CoTAL to be effective at scoring and explaining\nresponses, and their feedback produces valuable insights that enhance grading\naccuracy and explanation quality.",

The proposed approach extends\nthe eMbedded Profile for Joint Roughness (MPJR) interface finite element method\nto incorporate both surface topography and spatially varying adhesion\nproperties, imported directly from AFM measurements. The adhesion behavior is\nmodeled using a modified Lennard-Jones potential, which is locally\nparameterized based on the AFM-extracted adhesion peak force and energy\ndissipation data. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through 2D\nand 3D finite element simulations of a heterogeneous PS-LDPE (polystyrene\nmatrix with low-density polyethylene inclusions) sample, where the bulk elastic\nproperties are also experimentally characterized via AFM. The results highlight\nthe significance of accounting for both surface adhesion variability and\nmaterial bulk heterogeneity in accurately predicting contact responses.",

Prior to the collapse, lepton emissions\nsignificantly affect the cooling of the core and reduce its entropy. Therefore,\nthe lepton emission rates for Fe-group nuclei serve as an important input for\ncore-collapse simulations of high-mass stars.\n  From earlier simulation studies, isotopes of vanadium (V) have great\nastrophysical significance in regard to their weak-decay rates, which\nsubstantially affect $Y_e$ (fraction of lepton to baryon number) during the\nfinal developmental stages of massive stars. The current study involves the\ncomputation of the weak lepton emission (LE) rates for V isotopes by employing\nthe improved deformed proton-neutron Quasi-particle Random Phase Approximation\n(pn-QRPA) model. The mass numbers of the selected isotopes range from 43 to 64.\nThe LE rates on these isotopes have been estimated for a broad spectrum of\ndensity and temperature under astrophysical conditions. The ranges considered\nfor density and temperature are $10^1$ to $10^{11}$ (g/cm$^3$) and $10^7$ to $3\n\\times 10^{11}$ (K), respectively.\n  The lepton emission rates from the present study were also compared to the\nrates previously estimated by using the independent-particle model (IPM) and\nlarge-scale shell model (LSSM). IPM rates are generally bigger than QRPA rates,\nwhile LSSM rates overall show a good comparison with the reported rates.",

In this paper, we compare base and\npost-trained LLMs mechanistically from four perspectives to better understand\npost-training effects. Our findings across model families and datasets reveal\nthat: (1) Post-training does not change the factual knowledge storage\nlocations, and it adapts knowledge representations from the base model while\ndeveloping new knowledge representations; (2) Both truthfulness and refusal can\nbe represented by vectors in the hidden representation space. The truthfulness\ndirection is highly similar between the base and post-trained model, and it is\neffectively transferable for interventions; (3) The refusal direction is\ndifferent between the base and post-trained models, and it shows limited\nforward transferability; (4) Differences in confidence between the base and\npost-trained models cannot be attributed to entropy neurons.

Causal separation models, which rely only on past and\npresent information, offer a promising solution for real-time streaming.\nHowever, these models typically suffer from notable performance degradation due\nto the absence of future context. In this paper, we introduce a novel frontend\nthat is designed to mitigate the mismatch between training and run-time\ninference by implicitly incorporating future information into causal models\nthrough predictive patterns. The pretrained frontend employs a transformer\ndecoder network with a causal convolutional encoder as the backbone and is\npretrained in a self-supervised manner with two innovative pretext tasks:\nautoregressive hybrid prediction and contextual knowledge distillation. These\ntasks enable the model to capture predictive patterns directly from mixtures in\na self-supervised manner.

    "abstract": "In an increasingly interconnected world, understanding congestion-related\nphenomena in transportation and their underlying mechanisms is crucial for\nimproving efficiency. As the transportation system becomes denser, different\nmodes of transportation have more opportunities to interact with each other,\ngiving rise to emergent dynamics that simple models cannot explain. In this\nstudy, we investigate the synchronized motion of indirectly coupled\ntransportation modes. We develop a numerical simulation model on a\none-dimensional periodic lattice, where each point represents a bus station. In\nthis system, two types of buses operate: multiple local buses with\nnon-overlapping routes, each serving a specific zone, and a single global bus\nthat partially overlaps with the routes of the local buses. We perform\nnumerical simulations to examine how close the arrival times of these buses are\nto each other -- that is, how synchronized their motions are. When the number\nof zones is two, three, or five, robust synchronization occurs not only between\nthe global bus and the local buses, but also among the local buses themselves.\nIn contrast, no synchronization is found for other numbers of zones. We\ndeveloped a mathematical model using self-consistent equations and found that\ntwo distinct arrival patterns at the terminals must be considered. A stability\nanalysis reveals which pattern is ultimately realized in the simulations. Our\nresults show that transportation modes can exhibit coherent motion even when\nsharing only partial or no direct route overlaps. This outcome highlights that\nemergent behavior depends not only on local interactions but is also strongly\nshaped by the system's overall structural configuration.",

    "abstract": "Despite a large deaf and dumb population of 1.7 million, Bangla Sign Language\n(BdSL) remains a understudied domain. Specifically, there are no works on\nBangla text-to-gloss translation task. To address this gap, we begin by\naddressing the dataset problem. We take inspiration from grammatical rule based\ngloss generation used in Germany and American sign langauage (ASL) and adapt it\nfor BdSL. We also leverage LLM to generate synthetic data and use\nback-translation, text generation for data augmentation. With dataset prepared,\nwe started experimentation. We fine-tuned pretrained mBART-50 and\nmBERT-multiclass-uncased model on our dataset. We also trained GRU, RNN and a\nnovel seq-to-seq model with multi-head attention. We observe significant high\nperformance (ScareBLEU=79.53) with fine-tuning pretrained mBART-50 multilingual\nmodel from Facebook. We then explored why we observe such high performance with\nmBART. We soon notice an interesting property of mBART -- it was trained on\nshuffled and masked text data. And as we know, gloss form has shuffling\nproperty. So we hypothesize that mBART is inherently good at text-to-gloss\ntasks. To find support against this hypothesis, we trained mBART-50 on\nPHOENIX-14T benchmark and evaluated it with existing literature. Our mBART-50\nfinetune demonstrated State-of-the-Art performance on PHOENIX-14T benchmark,\nfar outperforming existing models in all 6 metrics (ScareBLEU = 63.89, BLEU-1 =\n55.14, BLEU-2 = 38.07, BLEU-3 = 27.13, BLEU-4 = 20.68, COMET = 0.624). Based on\nthe results, this study proposes a new paradigm for text-to-gloss task using\nmBART models. Additionally, our results show that BdSL text-to-gloss task can\ngreatly benefit from rule-based synthetic dataset.",

The challenge of this\ntask lies in distinguishing relevant and irrelevant moments. Previous methods\nfocused on learning continuous features exhibit weak differentiation between\nforeground and background features. In this paper, we propose a novel\nMoment-Quantization based Video Temporal Grounding method (MQVTG), which\nquantizes the input video into various discrete vectors to enhance the\ndiscrimination between relevant and irrelevant moments. Specifically, MQVTG\nmaintains a learnable moment codebook, where each video moment matches a\ncodeword. Considering the visual diversity, i.e., various visual expressions\nfor the same moment, MQVTG treats moment-codeword matching as a clustering\nprocess without using discrete vectors, avoiding the loss of useful information\nfrom direct hard quantization. Additionally, we employ effective\nprior-initialization and joint-projection strategies to enhance the maintained\nmoment codebook. With its simple implementation, the proposed method can be\nintegrated into existing temporal grounding models as a plug-and-play\ncomponent. Extensive experiments on six popular benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness and generalizability of MQVTG, significantly outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods. Further qualitative analysis shows that our method\neffectively groups relevant features and separates irrelevant ones, aligning\nwith our goal of enhancing discrimination.",

These contests attracted 200+ participants from\n100+ institutions over 20+ countries. To encourage participations, we provided\nstarter kits featuring GPU-optimized parallel market environments, ensemble\nlearning, and comprehensive instructions. In this paper, we summarize these\nbenchmarking efforts, detailing task formulations, data curation pipelines,\nenvironment implementations, evaluation protocols, participant performance, and\norganizational insights. It guides our follow-up FinRL contests, and also\nprovides a reference for FinAI contests alike.",

    "abstract": "In machine learning, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) requires domain\nknowledge of model design and a large amount of trial-and-error to achieve\npromising performance. Meanwhile, evolutionary algorithms have traditionally\nrelied on fixed rules and pre-defined building blocks. The Large Language Model\n(LLM)-Guided Evolution (GE) framework transformed this approach by\nincorporating LLMs to directly modify model source code for image\nclassification algorithms on CIFAR data and intelligently guide mutations and\ncrossovers. A key element of LLM-GE is the \"Evolution of Thought\" (EoT)\ntechnique, which establishes feedback loops, allowing LLMs to refine their\ndecisions iteratively based on how previous operations performed. In this\nstudy, we perform NAS for object detection by improving LLM-GE to modify the\narchitecture of You Only Look Once (YOLO) models to enhance performance on the\nKITTI dataset. Our approach intelligently adjusts the design and settings of\nYOLO to find the optimal algorithms against objective such as detection\naccuracy and speed. We show that LLM-GE produced variants with significant\nperformance improvements, such as an increase in Mean Average Precision from\n92.5% to 94.5%. This result highlights the flexibility and effectiveness of\nLLM-GE on real-world challenges, offering a novel paradigm for automated\nmachine learning that combines LLM-driven reasoning with evolutionary\nstrategies.",

Detecting such attacks is critical to ensuring the\nresponsible deployment of MLLMs. Existing jailbreak detection methods face\nthree primary challenges: (1) Many rely on model hidden states or gradients,\nlimiting their applicability to white-box models, where the internal workings\nof the model are accessible; (2) They involve high computational overhead from\nuncertainty-based analysis, which limits real-time detection, and (3) They\nrequire fully labeled harmful datasets, which are often scarce in real-world\nsettings.

To address this gap, this paper introduces the \"ABCDE\" as the key\nelements of Engineering AI and proposes a unified, systematic engineering AI\necosystem framework, including eight essential layers, along with attributes,\ngoals, and applications, to guide the development and deployment of AI\nsolutions for specific engineering needs. Additionally, key challenges are\nexamined, and eight future research directions are highlighted. By providing a\ncomprehensive perspective, this paper aims to advance the strategic\nimplementation of AI, fostering the development of next-generation engineering\nAI solutions.",

This\npaper proposes MMTL-UniAD, a unified multi-modal multi-task learning framework\nthat simultaneously recognizes driver behavior (e.g., looking around, talking),\ndriver emotion (e.g., anxiety, happiness), vehicle behavior (e.g., parking,\nturning), and traffic context (e.g., traffic jam, traffic smooth). A key\nchallenge is avoiding negative transfer between tasks, which can impair\nlearning performance. To address this, we introduce two key components into the\nframework: one is the multi-axis region attention network to extract global\ncontext-sensitive features, and the other is the dual-branch multimodal\nembedding to learn multimodal embeddings from both task-shared and\ntask-specific features. The former uses a multi-attention mechanism to extract\ntask-relevant features, mitigating negative transfer caused by task-unrelated\nfeatures. The latter employs a dual-branch structure to adaptively adjust\ntask-shared and task-specific parameters, enhancing cross-task knowledge\ntransfer while reducing task conflicts. We assess MMTL-UniAD on the AIDE\ndataset, using a series of ablation studies, and show that it outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

In this work, we revisit temporal search paradigms for\nlong-form video understanding and address a fundamental issue pertaining to all\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) long-context vision-language models (VLMs). Our\ncontributions are twofold: First, we frame temporal search as a Long Video\nHaystack problem: finding a minimal set of relevant frames (e.g., one to five)\nfrom tens of thousands based on specific queries. Upon this formulation, we\nintroduce LV-Haystack, the first dataset with 480 hours of videos, 15,092\nhuman-annotated instances for both training and evaluation aiming to improve\ntemporal search quality and efficiency. Results on LV-Haystack highlight a\nsignificant research gap in temporal search capabilities, with current SOTA\nsearch methods only achieving 2.1% temporal F1 score on the Longvideobench\nsubset. Next, inspired by visual search in images, we propose a lightweight\ntemporal search framework, T* that reframes costly temporal search as spatial\nsearch. T* leverages powerful visual localization techniques commonly used in\nimages and introduces an adaptive zooming-in mechanism that operates across\nboth temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments show that\nintegrating T* with existing methods significantly improves SOTA long-form\nvideo understanding. Under an inference budget of 32 frames, T* improves\nGPT-4o's performance from 50.5% to 53.1% and LLaVA-OneVision-OV-72B's\nperformance from 56.5% to 62.4% on the Longvideobench XL subset.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have not only showcased\nimpressive creative capabilities but also revealed emerging agentic behaviors\nthat exploit linguistic ambiguity in adversarial settings. In this study, we\ninvestigate how an LLM, acting as an autonomous agent, leverages semantic\nambiguity to generate deceptive puzzles that mislead and challenge human users.\nInspired by the popular puzzle game \"Connections\", we systematically compare\npuzzles produced through zero-shot prompting, role-injected adversarial\nprompts, and human-crafted examples, with an emphasis on understanding the\nunderlying agent decision-making processes. Employing computational analyses\nwith HateBERT to quantify semantic ambiguity, alongside subjective human\nevaluations, we demonstrate that explicit adversarial agent behaviors\nsignificantly heighten semantic ambiguity -- thereby increasing cognitive load\nand reducing fairness in puzzle solving. These findings provide critical\ninsights into the emergent agentic qualities of LLMs and underscore important\nethical considerations for evaluating and safely deploying autonomous language\nsystems in both educational technologies and entertainment.",

While previous studies have emphasized the\nimportance of technical indicators and feature engineering, we show that a\nsimple LSTM network trained on raw OHLCV data alone can match the performance\nof sophisticated ML models that incorporate technical indicators. Using a\ndataset of Korean stocks from 2006 to 2024, we optimize the triple barrier\nlabeling parameters to achieve balanced label proportions with a 29-day window\nand 9\\% barriers. Our experiments reveal that LSTM networks achieve similar\nperformance to traditional machine learning models like XGBoost, despite using\nonly raw OHLCV data without any technical indicators. Furthermore, we identify\nthat the optimal window size varies with model hidden size, with a\nconfiguration of window size 100 and hidden size 8 yielding the best\nperformance. Additionally, our results confirm that using full OHLCV data\nprovides better predictive accuracy compared to using only close price or close\nprice with volume.

The results cover the pseudorapidity range $\\left|\\eta\\right|\n< 1.1$ and constitute the first such measurement performed using a hadronic\ncalorimeter at RHIC. Measurements of $dE_{T}/d\\eta$ are presented for a range\nof centrality intervals and the average $dE_{T}/d\\eta$ as a function of the\nnumber of participating nucleons, $N_{\\mathrm{part}}$, is compared to a variety\nof Monte Carlo heavy-ion event generators. The results are in agreement with\nprevious measurements at RHIC, and feature an improved granularity in $\\eta$\nand improved precision in low-$N_{\\mathrm{part}}$ events.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the quantum deep sets model, expanding the quantum\nmachine learning tool-box by enabling the possibility of learning variadic\nfunctions using quantum systems. A couple of variants are presented for this\nmodel. The first one focuses on mapping sets to quantum systems through state\nvector averaging: each element of the set is mapped to a quantum state, and the\nquantum state of the set is the average of the corresponding quantum states of\nits elements. This approach allows the definition of a permutation-invariant\nvariadic model. The second variant is useful for ordered sets, i.e., sequences,\nand relies on optimal coherification of tristochastic tensors that implement\nproducts of mixed states: each element of the set is mapped to a density\nmatrix, and the quantum state of the set is the product of the corresponding\ndensity matrices of its elements. Such variant can be relevant in tasks such as\nnatural language processing. The resulting quantum state in any of the variants\nis then processed to realise a function that solves a machine learning task\nsuch as classification, regression or density estimation. Through synthetic\nproblem examples, the efficacy and versatility of quantum deep sets and\nsequences (QDSs) is demonstrated.",

While it is conjectured that CMI decays rapidly in\nfinite-temperature Gibbs states, a complete and general proof remains elusive.\nPrevious work addressed this problem in the high-temperature regime using\ncluster expansion techniques [T. Kuwahara, K. Kato, F.G.S.L. Brand\\~ao, Phys.\nRev.

In this work, we demonstrate that the cluster\nexpansion approach indeed fails to converge absolutely, even at any\nhigh-temperatures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach to\nproving the spatial decay of CMI. Our method leverages the connection between\nCMI and quantum recovery maps, specifically utilizing the Fawzi-Renner theorem.\nWe show that such recovery maps can be realized through dissipative dynamics,\nand by analyzing the locality properties of these dynamics, we establish the\nexponential decay of CMI in high-temperature regimes. As a technical\ncontribution, we also present a new result on the perturbative stability of\nquasi-local Liouvillian dynamics.

The critical values of the\nproposed tests are determined by a computationally efficient multiplier\nbootstrap procedure. Theoretical analysis shows that the sizes of the proposed\ntests can be well controlled by the nominal significance level, and the\nproposed tests are also consistent under certain local alternatives.

    "abstract": "Accurately modeling open quantum system dynamics is crucial for advancing\nquantum technologies, yet traditional methods struggle to balance accuracy and\nefficiency. Machine learning (ML) provides a promising alternative,\nparticularly through recursive models that predict system evolution based on\npast history. While these models have shown success in predicting single\nobservables, their effectiveness in more complex tasks, such as forecasting the\nfull reduced density matrix (RDM), remains unclear. We extend history-based\nrecursive ML approaches to complex quantum systems, comparing four\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN) architectures: (i) single-RDM-predicting\nPINN (SR-PINN), (ii) SR-PINN with simulation parameters (PSR-PINN), (iii)\nmulti-RDMs-predicting PINN (MR-PINN), and (iv) MR-PINN with simulation\nparameters (PMR-PINN). These models are applied to the spin-boson (SB) model\nand the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. Our results show that SR-PINN and\nPSR-PINN, constrained by a narrow history window, fail to capture complex\nquantum evolution, leading to unstable long-term predictions, especially in\nnonlinear and highly correlated dynamics. In contrast, MR-PINN and PMR-PINN\nimprove accuracy by extending the forecast horizon, incorporating long-range\ncorrelations, and reducing error propagation. Surprisingly, explicitly\nincluding simulation parameters such as temperature and reorganization energy\nin PSR-PINN and PMR-PINN does not consistently enhance accuracy and can even\nreduce performance, suggesting that these effects are already encoded in the\nRDM evolution. These findings highlight the limitations of short-sighted\nrecursive forecasting and demonstrate the superior stability and accuracy of\nfar-sighted approaches for long-term predictions.",

When this content requires\ncompression before processing, e.g., in distributed applications, coding\nmethods must optimize for both visual quality and downstream task performance.\nWe first show theoretically that an approach to reduce the effect of\ncompression for a given task loss is to perform rate-distortion optimization\n(RDO) using the distance between features, obtained from the original and the\ndecoded images, as a distortion metric. However, optimizing directly such a\nrate-distortion objective is computationally impractical because it requires\niteratively encoding and decoding the entire image-plus feature evaluation-for\neach possible coding configuration. We address this problem by simplifying the\nRDO formulation to make the distortion term computable using block-based\nencoders. We first apply Taylor's expansion to the feature extractor, recasting\nthe feature distance as a quadratic metric involving the Jacobian matrix of the\nneural network. Then, we replace the linearized metric with a block-wise\napproximation, which we call input-dependent squared error (IDSE). To make the\nmetric computable, we approximate IDSE using sketches of the Jacobian. The\nresulting loss can be evaluated block-wise in the transform domain and combined\nwith the sum of squared errors (SSE) to address both visual quality and\ncomputer vision performance. Simulations with AVC and HEVC across multiple\nfeature extractors and downstream networks show up to 17 % bit-rate savings for\nthe same task accuracy compared to RDO based on SSE, with no decoder complexity\noverhead and a small (7.86 %) encoder complexity increase.",

    "abstract": "The Markov property entails the conditional independence structure inherent\nin Gibbs distributions for general classical Hamiltonians, a feature that plays\na crucial role in inference, mixing time analysis, and algorithm design.\nHowever, much less is known about quantum Gibbs states. In this work, we show\nthat for any Hamiltonian with a bounded interaction degree, the quantum Gibbs\nstate is locally Markov at arbitrary temperature, meaning there exists a\nquasi-local recovery map for every local region. Notably, this recovery map is\nobtained by applying a detailed-balanced Lindbladian with jumps acting on the\nregion. Consequently, we prove that (i) the conditional mutual information\n(CMI) for a shielded small region decays exponentially with the shielding\ndistance, and (ii) under the assumption of uniform clustering of correlations,\nGibbs states of general non-commuting Hamiltonians on $D$-dimensional lattices\ncan be prepared by a quantum circuit of depth $e^{O(\\log^D(n/\\epsilon))}$,\nwhich can be further reduced assuming certain local gap condition. Our proofs\nintroduce a regularization scheme for imaginary-time-evolved operators at\narbitrarily low temperatures and reveal a connection between the Dirichlet\nform, a dynamic quantity, and the commutator in the KMS inner product, a static\nquantity. We believe these tools pave the way for tackling further challenges\nin quantum thermodynamics and mixing times, particularly in low-temperature\nregimes.",

    "abstract": "Service systems like data centers and ride-hailing are popularly modeled as\nqueueing systems in the literature. Such systems are primarily studied in the\nsteady state due to their analytical tractability. However, almost all\napplications in real life do not operate in a steady state, so there is a clear\ndiscrepancy in translating theoretical queueing results to practical\napplications. To this end, we provide a finite-time convergence for Erlang-C\nsystems (also known as $M/M/n$ queues), providing a stepping stone towards\nunderstanding the transient behavior of more general queueing systems. We\nobtain a bound on the Chi-square distance between the finite time queue length\ndistribution and the stationary distribution for a finite number of servers. We\nthen use these bounds to study the behavior in the many-server heavy-traffic\nasymptotic regimes. The Erlang-C model exhibits a phase transition at the\nso-called Halfin-Whitt regime. We show that our mixing rate matches the\nlimiting behavior in the Super-Halfin-Whitt regime, and matches up to a\nconstant factor in the Sub-Halfin-Whitt regime.\n  To prove such a result, we employ the Lyapunov-Poincar\\'e approach, where we\nfirst carefully design a Lyapunov function to obtain a negative drift outside a\nfinite set. Within the finite set, we develop different strategies depending on\nthe properties of the finite set to get a handle on the mixing behavior via a\nlocal Poincar\\'e inequality. A key aspect of our methodological contribution is\nin obtaining tight guarantees in these two regions, which when combined give us\ntight mixing time bounds. We believe that this approach is of independent\ninterest for studying mixing in reversible countable-state Markov chains more\ngenerally.",

However, this fusion\nfaces three significant issues: (1) False Negatives in contrastive learning can\ndegrade the training signal by penalizing similar items; (2) Popularity Bias,\noften encoded as embedding magnitude, can distort similarity scores; and (3)\nSignal Ambiguity, which arises from the conflation of objective facts with\nsubjective sentiment in reviews. These interconnected issues can prevent models\nfrom learning users' true preferences. In this paper, we propose SymCERE\n(Symmetric SINCERE), a contrastive learning method that addresses these three\nissues simultaneously through its structural design. First, we introduce a\nsymmetric application of the SINCERE loss for cross-modal alignment, which is\ndesigned to eliminate false negatives in recommendation. Second, by integrating\nthis with L2 normalisation under a \"magnitude-as-noise\" hypothesis, we aim to\nmitigate popularity bias by forcing the model to encode preferences primarily\nin the vector's direction. Experiments on 15 datasets from three distinct\nplatforms (e-commerce, local reviews, and travel) demonstrate that SymCERE\noutperforms several strong baselines, achieving a relative improvement of up to\n43.6% on NDCG@10. Furthermore, a detailed LIME analysis shows that the model\nlearns to anchor alignment on objective, informative vocabulary (e.g., \"OEM,\"\n\"compatible,\" \"gasket\"), while placing less emphasis on generic sentiment\n(e.g., \"good,\" \"great\"). This suggests that effective semantic alignment stems\nfrom understanding factual product attributes, offering a path toward more\naccurate recommendation systems.

    "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is an increasingly\ncritical step in post-training. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has\nemerged as a simple, yet effective alternative to reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF). Synthetic preference data with its low cost and high\nquality enable effective alignment through single- or multi-model generated\npreference data. Our study reveals a striking, safety-specific phenomenon\nassociated with DPO alignment: Although multi-model generated data enhances\nperformance on general tasks (ARC, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, Winogrande) by\nproviding diverse responses, it also tends to facilitate reward hacking during\ntraining. This can lead to a high attack success rate (ASR) when models\nencounter jailbreaking prompts. The issue is particularly pronounced when\nemploying stronger models like GPT-4o or larger models in the same family to\ngenerate chosen responses paired with target model self-generated rejected\nresponses, resulting in dramatically poorer safety outcomes. Furthermore, with\nrespect to safety, using solely self-generated responses (single-model\ngeneration) for both chosen and rejected pairs significantly outperforms\nconfigurations that incorporate responses from stronger models, whether used\ndirectly as chosen data or as part of a multi-model response pool. We\ndemonstrate that multi-model preference data exhibits high linear separability\nbetween chosen and rejected responses, which allows models to exploit\nsuperficial cues rather than internalizing robust safety constraints. Our\nexperiments, conducted on models from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families,\nconsistently validate these findings.",

    "abstract": "Noncentral heavy-ion collisions create fireballs with large initial orbital\nangular momentum that is expected to induce strong vorticity in the hot bulk\nfluid and generate global spin polarization of the produced particles. As the\ncollision beam energy $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ decreases to approach the\ntwo-nucleon-mass threshold, this initial angular momentum approaches zero. One\nmay thus expect that the observed global spin polarization should reach a\nmaximum and then drop to zero as increased stopping competes with decreased\ninitial momentum. Recent experimental measurements, however, appear to show a\ncontinual rise of hyperon polarization even down to $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} =$ 2.42\nGeV, suggesting a peak very near threshold which is difficult to interpret and\ncalls for a better understanding of angular momentum initial conditions,\nespecially at low energy. Here, we develop a new Glauber-based initial state\nmodel (\"Glauber+\") to investigate the initial distribution of angular momentum\nwith respect to rapidity as well as the dependence of this distribution on\ninitial baryon stopping across a wide range of collisional beam energy. We\nestimate that the angular momentum per produced final charged particle at\nmid-rapidity peaks around 5 GeV, which may present a potential challenge to an\ninterpretation of the spin polarization measurements near threshold as being a\nconsequence of the initial angular momentum of the colliding system.",

In TSPN (which\ngeneralizes classic TSP), each client represents a set (or neighbourhood) of\npoints in a metric and the goal is to find a minimum cost TSP tour that visits\nat least one point from each client set. In the Euclidean setting, each\nneighbourhood is a region on the plane. TSPN is significantly more difficult\nthan classic TSP even in the Euclidean setting, as it captures group TSP. A\nnotable case of TSPN is when each neighbourhood is a line segment. Although\nthere are PTASs for when neighbourhoods are fat objects (with limited overlap),\nTSPN over line segments is APX-hard even if all the line segments have unit\nlength. For parallel (unit) line segments, the best approximation factor is\n$3\\sqrt2$ from more than two decades ago [DM03].

The weak interactions between free alkali\nmetal ions X$^+$ (X = Rb, Cs) and I$^-$ anions induce pronounced lattice\nanharmonicity, which enhances phonon scattering and suppresses group\nvelocities, thereby reducing the particle-like thermal conductivity ($\\rm\n\\kappa_p$). Concurrently, the significant bonding heterogeneity within the\n[Re$_6$S$_8$I$_6$]$^{4-}$ clusters promotes phonon dispersion flattening and\nlow-frequency phonon localization. The resulting discretized phonon flat bands\nsubstantially diminish the glass-like thermal conductivity ($\\rm \\kappa_c$). At\nroom temperature, the total $\\rm \\kappa_L$ of X$_6$Re$_6$S$_8$I$_8$ (X = Rb,\nCs) falls below 0.2 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. Furthermore, the bonding characteristics\nbetween X$^+$ and I$^{-1}$ anions induce an anomalous cation mass-independent\nstiffening of low-frequency phonon branches in this system, resulting in\ncounterintuitive thermal transport behavior.

Our team was undefeated for\nall seated matches and scored 45 goals over 6 games, winning the championship\ngame 6 to 1. During the competition, a major challenge for collision avoidance\nwas the measurement noise coming from bipedal locomotion and a limited field of\nview (FOV). Furthermore, obstacles would sporadically jump in and out of our\nplanned trajectory. At times our estimator would place our robot inside a hard\nconstraint. Any planner in this competition must also be be computationally\nefficient enough to re-plan and react in real time. This motivated our approach\nto trajectory generation and tracking. In many scenarios long-term and\nshort-term planning is needed. To efficiently find a long-term general path\nthat avoids all obstacles we developed DAVG (Dynamic Augmented Visibility\nGraphs). DAVG focuses on essential path planning by setting certain regions to\nbe active based on obstacles and the desired goal pose. By augmenting the\nstates in the graph, turning angles are considered, which is crucial for a\nlarge soccer playing robot as turning may be more costly. A trajectory is\nformed by linearly interpolating between discrete points generated by DAVG. A\nmodified version of model predictive control (MPC) is used to then track this\ntrajectory called cf-MPC (Collision-Free MPC). This ensures short-term\nplanning. Without having to switch formulations cf-MPC takes into account the\nrobot dynamics and collision free constraints. Without a hard switch the\ncontrol input can smoothly transition in cases where the noise places our robot\ninside a constraint boundary. The nonlinear formulation runs at approximately\n120 Hz, while the quadratic version achieves around 400 Hz.",

In the modified Langevin noise formalism, the boundary- and\nmedium-assisted (BA and MA) fields, which constitute a continuum set of EM\nmodes in dissipative EM environments, are numerically obtained using the\nfinite-element method (FEM). Specifically, BA field modes are extracted by\nsolving plane-wave scattering problems, while MA field modes are determined\nthrough point-source radiation problems. These numerically obtained BA and MA\nfield modes are then incorporated into the multimode Jaynes- and Tavis-Cummings\nmodels such that the coupling strength between atoms and BA-MA field modes can\nbe calculated for the study of atom-field interactions in dissipative EM\nenvironments.
