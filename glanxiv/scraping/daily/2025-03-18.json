We demonstrate that real-time tracking of fluctuating fields\nbenefits from measurement-induced spin-squeezing and that quantum limits\ndictated by decoherence are within reach of today's experiments.

In these systems the Mean Square Displacement (MSD) grows in time\nfaster than linearly. We show that irrespective of the geometry of these\nchannels, the distribution of the first return times decays algebraically with\ntwo different exponents, separated by a crossover region that is determined by\nthe MSD. We find that the distribution of first return times satisfies a simple\nscaling form. In turn, the transmission coefficient, defined as the fraction of\ntrajectories that starting at the cell at the origin escape the channel through\nthe other boundary, decays algebraically with the size of the system, and, as a\nsignature of non-recurrent transport, sometimes slower. From these two\nprocesses we derive a locking relation among the scaling exponents for the\nasymptotic behavior of the MSD, the times of first return to the origin and the\nway transmission decays with the system size, showing that these three\nprocesses are interdependent. The locking relation holds for diffusive\nprocesses, as well as for fractional Brownian motion with arbitrary Hurst\nexponent. We argue that the locking relation may be valid for many other\ntransport processes, Markovian or not, with finite MSD.",

    "abstract": "The United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) microlensing survey was\nconducted over four years, from 2016 to 2019, with the goal of serving as a\nprecursor to future near-infrared microlensing surveys (Shvartzvald et al.\n2017). Focusing on stars in the Galactic center and utilizing near-infrared\npassbands, the survey identified approximately one thousand microlensing\nevents, 27 of which displayed anomalies in their light curves (Wen et al.\n2023). This paper presents an analysis of these anomalous events, aiming to\nuncover the underlying causes of the observed anomalies. The events were\nanalyzed under various configurations, considering the potential binarity of\nboth the lens and the source. For 11 events that were additionally observed by\nother optical microlensing surveys, including those conducted by the OGLE,\nKMTNet, and MOA collaborations, we incorporated their data into our analysis.\nAmong the reported anomalous events, we revealed the nature of 24 events except\nfor three events, in which one was likely to be a transient variable, and two\nwere were difficult to accurately characterize their nature due to the\nlimitations of the available data. We confirmed the binary lens nature of the\nanomalies in 22 events. Among these, we verified the earlier discovery that the\ncompanion in the binary lens system UKIRT11L is a planetary object. Accurately\ndescribing the anomaly in UKIRT21 required a model that accounted for the\nbinarity of both the lens and the source. For two events UKIRT01 and UKIRT17,\nthe anomalies could be interpreted using either a binary-source or a\nbinary-lens model.",

    "abstract": "Edges are one of the most basic parametric primitives to describe structural\ninformation in 3D. In this paper, we study parametric 3D edge reconstruction\nfrom calibrated multi-view images. Previous methods usually reconstruct a 3D\nedge point set from multi-view 2D edge images, and then fit 3D edges to the\npoint set. However, noise in the point set may cause gaps among fitted edges,\nand the recovered edges may not align with input multi-view images since the\nedge fitting depends only on the reconstructed 3D point set. To mitigate these\nproblems, we propose SketchSplat, a method to reconstruct accurate, complete,\nand compact 3D edges via differentiable multi-view sketch splatting. We\nrepresent 3D edges as sketches, which are parametric lines and curves defined\nby attributes including control points, scales, and opacity. During\nreconstruction, we iteratively sample Gaussian points from a set of sketches\nand rasterize the Gaussians onto 2D edge images. Then the gradient of the image\nloss can be back-propagated to optimize the sketch attributes. Our method\nbridges 2D edge images and 3D edges in a differentiable manner, which ensures\nthat 3D edges align well with 2D images and leads to accurate and complete\nresults. We also propose a series of adaptive topological operations to reduce\nredundant edges and apply them along with the sketch optimization, yielding a\nmore compact reconstruction. Finally, we contribute an accurate 2D edge\ndetector that improves the performance of both ours and existing methods.\nExperiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy,\ncompleteness, and compactness on a benchmark CAD dataset.",

    "abstract": "Single-image super-resolution (SISR) is a fundamental problem in computer\nvision that aims to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution\n(LR) inputs. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved\nsubstantial advancements, deeper architectures often introduce excessive\nparameters, higher memory usage, and computational cost, limiting their\napplicability on resource-constrained devices. Recent research has thus focused\non lightweight architectures that preserve accuracy while reducing complexity.\nThis paper presents the Involution and BSConv Multi-Depth Distillation Network\n(IBMDN), a lightweight and effective architecture for SISR. The proposed IBMDN\ncomprises Involution and BSConv Multi-Depth Distillation Blocks (IBMDB) and a\nContrast and High-Frequency Attention Block (CHFAB). IBMDB employs varying\ncombinations of Involution and BSConv at multiple depths to perform efficient\nfeature extraction while minimizing computational complexity. CHFAB, a\nlightweight self-attention mechanism, focuses on extracting high-frequency and\ncontrast information to enhance perceptual quality in the reconstructed images.\nThe flexible design of IBMDB enables it to be seamlessly integrated into\ndiverse SISR frameworks, including information distillation, transformer-based,\nand GAN-based models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating\nIBMDB significantly reduces memory usage, parameters, and floating-point\noperations (FLOPs), while achieving improvements in both pixel-wise accuracy\nand visual quality.

    "abstract": "Various deep learning models have been developed for indoor localization\nbased on radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. However, they often\nrequire adaptation to ensure accurate tracking in new target operational\ndomains. To address this challenge, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)\nmethods have been proposed to align pre-trained models with data from target\nenvironments. However, they rely on large annotated datasets from the initial\ndomain (source). Source data access is limited by privacy, storage,\ncomputational, and transfer constraints. Although many source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA) methods address these constraints in classification, applying\nthem to regression models for localization remains challenging. Indeed, target\ndatasets for indoor localization are typically small, with few features and\nsamples, and are noisy. Adapting regression models requires high-confidence\ntarget pseudo-annotation to avoid over-training. In this paper, a specialized\nmean-teacher method called MTLoc is proposed for SFDA. MTLoc updates the\nstudent network using noisy data and teacher-generated pseudo-labels. The\nteacher network maintains stability through exponential moving averages. To\nfurther ensure robustness, the teacher's pseudo-labels are refined using\nk-nearest neighbor correction. MTLoc allows for self-supervised learning on\ntarget data, facilitating effective adaptation to dynamic and noisy indoor\nenvironments. Validated using real-world data from our experimental setup with\nINLAN Inc., our results show that MTLoc achieves high localization accuracy\nunder challenging conditions, significantly reducing localization error\ncompared to baselines, including the state-of-the-art adversarial UDA approach\nwith access to source data.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated\nmulti-turn manipulation attacks, where adversaries strategically build context\nthrough seemingly benign conversational turns to circumvent safety measures and\nelicit harmful or unauthorized responses. These attacks exploit the temporal\nnature of dialogue to evade single-turn detection methods, representing a\ncritical security vulnerability with significant implications for real-world\ndeployments.\n  This paper introduces the Temporal Context Awareness (TCA) framework, a novel\ndefense mechanism designed to address this challenge by continuously analyzing\nsemantic drift, cross-turn intention consistency and evolving conversational\npatterns. The TCA framework integrates dynamic context embedding analysis,\ncross-turn consistency verification, and progressive risk scoring to detect and\nmitigate manipulation attempts effectively. Preliminary evaluations on\nsimulated adversarial scenarios demonstrate the framework's potential to\nidentify subtle manipulation patterns often missed by traditional detection\ntechniques, offering a much-needed layer of security for conversational AI\nsystems. In addition to outlining the design of TCA , we analyze diverse attack\nvectors and their progression across multi-turn conversation, providing\nvaluable insights into adversarial tactics and their impact on LLM\nvulnerabilities. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust,\ncontext-aware defenses in conversational AI systems and highlight TCA framework\nas a promising direction for securing LLMs while preserving their utility in\nlegitimate applications. We make our implementation available to support\nfurther research in this emerging area of AI security.",

    "abstract": "Strain sensors are gaining popularity in soft robotics for acquiring tactile\ndata due to their flexibility and ease of integration. Tactile sensing plays a\ncritical role in soft grippers, enabling them to safely interact with\nunstructured environments and precisely detect object properties. However, a\nsignificant challenge with these systems is their high non-linearity,\ntime-varying behavior, and long-term signal drift. In this paper, we introduce\na continual learning (CL) approach to model a soft finger equipped with\npiezoelectric-based strain sensors for proprioception. To tackle the\naforementioned challenges, we propose an adaptive CL algorithm that integrates\na Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with a memory buffer for rehearsal and\nincludes a regularization term to keep the model's decision boundary close to\nthe base signal while adapting to time-varying drift. We conduct nine different\nexperiments, resetting the entire setup each time to demonstrate signal drift.\nWe also benchmark our algorithm against two other methods and conduct an\nablation study to assess the impact of different components on the overall\nperformance.",

To optimize\nsynchronization efficiency among users and improve overall system performance,\nwe propose a collaborative SFL framework (CSFL).

Wireless communication between users facilitates\nreal-time collaboration, allowing high-efficiency users to assist bottleneck\nusers in handling part of the model's computation, thereby alleviating the\ncomputational load on bottleneck users. Simulation results show that our\nproposed CSFL framework reduces synchronization delays and improves overall\nsystem throughput while maintaining similar performance and convergence rate to\nthe SFL framework.

In recent years, researchers tend to apply object detection to\nunderwater robots equipped with vision systems to complete tasks including\nseafood fishing, fish farming, biodiversity monitoring and so on. However, the\ndiversity and complexity of underwater environments bring new challenges to\nobject detection. First, aquatic organisms tend to live together, which leads\nto severe occlusion. Second, theaquatic organisms are good at hiding\nthemselves, which have a similar color to the background. Third, the various\nwater quality and changeable and extreme lighting conditions lead to the\ndistorted, low contrast, blue or green images obtained by the underwater\ncamera, resulting in domain shift. And the deep model is generally vulnerable\nto facing domain shift. Fourth, the movement of the underwater robot leads to\nthe blur of the captured image and makes the water muddy, which results in low\nvisibility of the water. This paper investigates the problems brought by the\nunderwater environment mentioned above, and aims to design a high-performance\nand robust underwater object detector.",

However, a major challenge in using these datasets is their lack of\nreliable labels: there are myriad types of incidents, many types occur rarely,\nand ground-truth measures of where incidents occur are lacking. Here, we\npropose BayFlood, a two-stage approach which circumvents this difficulty.\nFirst, we perform zero-shot classification of where incidents occur using a\npretrained vision-language model (VLM). Second, we fit a spatial Bayesian model\non the VLM classifications. The zero-shot approach avoids the need to annotate\nlarge training sets, and the Bayesian model provides frequent desiderata in\nurban settings - principled measures of uncertainty, smoothing across\nlocations, and incorporation of external data like stormwater accumulation\nzones. We comprehensively validate this two-stage approach, showing that VLMs\nprovide strong zero-shot signal for floods across multiple cities and time\nperiods, the Bayesian model improves out-of-sample prediction relative to\nbaseline methods, and our inferred flood risk correlates with known external\npredictors of risk. Having validated our approach, we show it can be used to\nimprove urban flood detection: our analysis reveals 113,738 people who are at\nhigh risk of flooding overlooked by current methods, identifies demographic\nbiases in existing methods, and suggests locations for new flood sensors. More\nbroadly, our results showcase how Bayesian modeling of zero-shot LM annotations\nrepresents a promising paradigm because it avoids the need to collect large\nlabeled datasets and leverages the power of foundation models while providing\nthe expressiveness and uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models.",

These problems arise in great\ndiversity in various fields, be they related to dynamics, as in questions of\nrobust stability and robust control, or related to graphs, as in questions of\nclustering and ranking. Algorithms for such problems work with matrix\nperturbations that drive eigenvalues or singular values or Rayleigh quotients\nto desired locations.\n  Remarkably, the optimal perturbation matrices are typically of rank one or\nare projections of rank-1 matrices onto a linear structure, e.g. a prescribed\nsparsity pattern. In the approach worked out here, these optimal rank-1\nperturbations will be determined in a two-level iteration: In the inner\niteration, an eigenvalue optimization problem for a fixed perturbation size is\nto be solved via gradient-based rank-1 matrix differential equations. This\namounts to numerically driving a rank-1 matrix, which is represented by two\nvectors, into a stationary point, mostly starting nearby. The outer iteration\ndetermines the optimal perturbation size by solving a scalar nonlinear\nequation.\n  A wide variety of matrix nearness problems, as outlined in the introductory\nChapter I, will be tackled in Chapters II to VIII by such an approach and its\nnontrivial extensions.",

For these\nverbalized expressions of uncertainty to be meaningful, they should reflect the\nerror rates at the expressed level of confidence. However, when prompted to\nexpress confidence, the error rates of current LLMs are inconsistent with their\ncommunicated confidences, highlighting the need for uncertainty quantification\nmethods. Many prior methods calculate lexical uncertainty, estimating a model's\nconfidence in the specific string it generated. In some cases, however, it may\nbe more useful to estimate semantic uncertainty, or the model's confidence in\nthe answer regardless of how it is verbalized. We propose a simple procedure,\nuncertainty distillation, to teach an LLM to verbalize calibrated semantic\nconfidences. Using held-out data to map initial uncertainty estimates to\nmeaningful probabilities, we create examples annotated with verbalized\nprobabilities for supervised fine-tuning. We compare uncertainty distillation\nto several strong baselines, and find that our method yields verbalized\nconfidences that correlate well with observed error rates.",

The test is relevant for analyzing income inequality, evaluating\ntreatment effects, and studying discrimination. We propose a\nKolmogorov--Smirnov-type test statistic that utilizes induced order statistics\nfrom independent samples. Notably, the test features a data-independent\ncritical value, eliminating the need for resampling techniques such as the\nbootstrap. Our approach avoids kernel smoothing and parametric assumptions,\ninstead relying on a tuning parameter to select relevant observations. We\nestablish the asymptotic properties of our test, showing that the induced order\nstatistics converge to independent draws from the true conditional\ndistributions and that the test is asymptotically of level $\\alpha$ under weak\nregularity conditions. While our results apply to both continuous and discrete\ndata, in the discrete case, the critical value only provides a valid upper\nbound. To address this, we propose a refined critical value that significantly\nenhances power, requiring only knowledge of the support size of the\ndistributions. Additionally, we analyze the test's behavior in the limit\nexperiment, demonstrating that it reduces to a problem analogous to testing\nunconditional stochastic dominance in finite samples.

This may indicate that the spion-orbit effect grows, when\nincreasing the atomic number, slightly faster than the mass-velocity effect.

    "abstract": "In 2021 May the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration\nbegan a 5-year spectroscopic redshift survey to produce a detailed map of the\nevolving three-dimensional structure of the universe between $z=0$ and\n$z\\approx4$. DESI's principle scientific objectives are to place precise\nconstraints on the equation of state of dark energy, the gravitationally driven\ngrowth of large-scale structure, and the sum of the neutrino masses, and to\nexplore the observational signatures of primordial inflation. We present DESI\nData Release 1 (DR1), which consists of all data acquired during the first 13\nmonths of the DESI main survey, as well as a uniform reprocessing of the DESI\nSurvey Validation data which was previously made public in the DESI Early Data\nRelease. The DR1 main survey includes high-confidence redshifts for 18.7M\nobjects, of which 13.1M are spectroscopically classified as galaxies, 1.6M as\nquasars, and 4M as stars, making DR1 the largest sample of extragalactic\nredshifts ever assembled. We summarize the DR1 observations, the spectroscopic\ndata-reduction pipeline and data products, large-scale structure catalogs,\nvalue-added catalogs, and describe how to access and interact with the data. In\naddition to fulfilling its core cosmological objectives with unprecedented\nprecision, we expect DR1 to enable a wide range of transformational\nastrophysical studies and discoveries.",

    "abstract": "The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Collaboration has obtained\nrobust measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the redshift\nrange, $0.1 < z < 4.2$, based on the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest and galaxies from\nData Release 2 (DR2). We combine these measurements with external cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT to place our tightest\nconstraints yet on the sum of neutrino masses. Assuming the cosmological\n$\\Lambda$CDM model and three degenerate neutrino states, we find $\\sum\nm_\\nu<0.0642$ eV (95%). When accounting for neutrino oscillation constraints,\nwe find a preference for the normal mass ordering and an upper bound of $m_l <\n0.023$ eV (95%) on the lightest neutrino mass. However, we determine using\nfrequentist and Bayesian methods that our constraints are in moderate tension\nwith the lower limits derived from neutrino oscillations. Correcting for the\nphysical boundary at zero mass, we report a 95% Feldman-Cousins upper bound of\n$\\sum m_\\nu<0.053$ eV, breaching the lower limit from neutrino oscillations.\nConsidering a more general Bayesian analysis with an effective cosmological\nneutrino mass parameter, $\\sum m_{\\nu,\\mathrm{eff}}$, that allows for negative\nenergy densities and removes unsatisfactory prior weight effects, we derive\nconstraints that are in $3\\sigma$ tension with the same oscillation limit. In\nthe absence of unknown systematics, this finding could be interpreted as a hint\nof new physics not necessarily related to neutrinos. The preference of DESI and\nCMB data for an evolving dark energy model offers one possible solution. In the\n$w_0w_a$CDM model, we find $\\sum m_\\nu<0.163$ eV (95%), resolving the neutrino\ntension.

    "abstract": "We conduct an extended analysis of dark energy constraints, in support of the\nfindings of the DESI DR2 cosmology key paper, including DESI data, Planck CMB\nobservations, and three different supernova compilations. Using a broad range\nof parametric and non-parametric methods, we explore the dark energy\nphenomenology and find consistent trends across all approaches, in good\nagreement with the $w_0w_a$CDM key paper results. Even with the additional\nflexibility introduced by non-parametric approaches, such as binning and\nGaussian Processes, we find that extending $\\Lambda$CDM to include a\ntwo-parameter $w(z)$ is sufficient to capture the trends present in the data.\nFinally, we examine three dark energy classes with distinct dynamics, including\nquintessence scenarios satisfying $w \\geq -1$, to explore what underlying\nphysics can explain such deviations. The current data indicate a clear\npreference for models that feature a phantom crossing; although alternatives\nlacking this feature are disfavored, they cannot yet be ruled out. Our analysis\nconfirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy, particularly at low\nredshift ($z \\lesssim 0.3$), is robust and stable under different modeling\nchoices.",

    "abstract": "The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release 2 (DR2) galaxy\nand quasar clustering data represents a significant expansion of data from DR1,\nproviding improved statistical precision in BAO constraints across multiple\ntracers, including bright galaxies (BGS), luminous red galaxies (LRGs),\nemission line galaxies (ELGs), and quasars (QSOs). In this paper, we validate\nthe BAO analysis of DR2. We present the results of robustness tests on the\nblinded DR2 data and, after unblinding, consistency checks on the unblinded DR2\ndata. All results are compared to those obtained from a suite of mock catalogs\nthat replicate the selection and clustering properties of the DR2 sample. We\nconfirm the consistency of DR2 BAO measurements with DR1 while achieving a\nreduction in statistical uncertainties due to the increased survey volume and\ncompleteness. We assess the impact of analysis choices, including different\ndata vectors (correlation function vs. power spectrum), modeling approaches and\nsystematics treatments, and an assumption of the Gaussian likelihood, finding\nthat our BAO constraints are stable across these variations and assumptions\nwith a few minor refinements to the baseline setup of the DR1 BAO analysis. We\nsummarize a series of pre-unblinding tests that confirmed the readiness of our\nanalysis pipeline, the final systematic errors, and the DR2 BAO analysis\nbaseline. The successful completion of these tests led to the unblinding of the\nDR2 BAO measurements, ultimately leading to the DESI DR2 cosmological analysis,\nwith their implications for the expansion history of the Universe and the\nnature of dark energy presented in the DESI key paper.",

We have also increased\nthe number of realisations used in the validation to 400, compared to the 150\nrealisations used in DR1. Finally, we present a detailed study of the impact of\nquasar redshift errors on the BAO measurement, and we compare different\nstrategies to mask Damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ Absorbers (DLAs) in our spectra.

Our\nmethod uses quasar spectral templates with and without absorption from\nintervening DLAs to reconstruct observed quasar forest regions. The\nbest-fitting model determines whether a DLA is present while estimating the\nredshift and \\texttt{HI} column density. With an optimized quality cut on\ndetection significance ($\\Delta \\chi_{r}^2>0.03$), the technique achieves an\nestimated 80\\% purity and 79\\% completeness when evaluated on simulated spectra\nwith S/N~$>2$ that are free of broad absorption lines (BAL).

We present a strategy for combining these three techniques to\nproduce a high-fidelity DLA catalog from DESI DR2 for the Ly$\\alpha$ forest\nbaryon acoustic oscillation measurement.

    "abstract": "We present the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements with the\nLyman-alpha (LyA) forest from the second data release (DR2) of the Dark Energy\nSpectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. Our BAO measurements include both the\nauto-correlation of the LyA forest absorption observed in the spectra of\nhigh-redshift quasars and the cross-correlation of the absorption with the\nquasar positions. The total sample size is approximately a factor of two larger\nthan the DR1 dataset, with forest measurements in over 820,000 quasar spectra\nand the positions of over 1.2 million quasars. We describe several significant\nimprovements to our analysis in this paper, and two supporting papers describe\nimprovements to the synthetic datasets that we use for validation and how we\nidentify damped LyA absorbers. Our main result is that we have measured the BAO\nscale with a statistical precision of 1.1% along and 1.3% transverse to the\nline of sight, for a combined precision of 0.65% on the isotropic BAO scale at\n$z_{eff} = 2.33$. This excellent precision, combined with recent theoretical\nstudies of the BAO shift due to nonlinear growth, motivated us to include a\nsystematic error term in LyA BAO analysis for the first time. We measure the\nratios $D_H(z_{eff})/r_d = 8.632 \\pm 0.098 \\pm 0.026$ and $D_M(z_{eff})/r_d =\n38.99 \\pm 0.52 \\pm 0.12$, where $D_H = c/H(z)$ is the Hubble distance, $D_M$ is\nthe transverse comoving distance, $r_d$ is the sound horizon at the drag epoch,\nand we quote both the statistical and the theoretical systematic uncertainty.\nThe companion paper presents the BAO measurements at lower redshifts from the\nsame dataset and the cosmological interpretation.",

    "abstract": "We present baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from more than 14\nmillion galaxies and quasars drawn from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic\nInstrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), based on three years of operation. For\ncosmology inference, these galaxy measurements are combined with DESI\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest BAO results presented in a companion paper. The DR2 BAO\nresults are consistent with DESI DR1 and SDSS, and their distance-redshift\nrelationship matches those from recent compilations of supernovae (SNe) over\nthe same redshift range. The results are well described by a flat $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel, but the parameters preferred by BAO are in mild, $2.3\\sigma$ tension\nwith those determined from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), although the\nDESI results are consistent with the acoustic angular scale $\\theta_*$ that is\nwell-measured by Planck. This tension is alleviated by dark energy with a\ntime-evolving equation of state parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, which provides\na better fit to the data, with a favored solution in the quadrant with $w_0>-1$\nand $w_a<0$. This solution is preferred over $\\Lambda$CDM at $3.1\\sigma$ for\nthe combination of DESI BAO and CMB data. When also including SNe, the\npreference for a dynamical dark energy model over $\\Lambda$CDM ranges from\n$2.8-4.2\\sigma$ depending on which SNe sample is used. We present evidence from\nother data combinations which also favor the same behavior at high\nsignificance. From the combination of DESI and CMB we derive 95% upper limits\non the sum of neutrino masses, finding $\\sum m_\\nu<0.064$ eV assuming\n$\\Lambda$CDM and $\\sum m_\\nu<0.16$ eV in the $w_0w_a$ model. Unless there is an\nunknown systematic error associated with one or more datasets, it is clear that\n$\\Lambda$CDM is being challenged by the combination of DESI BAO with other\nmeasurements and that dynamical dark energy offers a possible solution.",

Additionally, they\nperform densification based solely on per-point gradients and process poses\nindependently, ignoring spatial and temporal correlations. These limitations\nlead to geometric detail loss, temporal instability, and inefficient point\ndistribution. To address these issues, we propose HandSplat, a novel Gaussian\nSplatting-based framework that enhances both fidelity and stability for hand\nrendering. To improve fidelity, we extend standard 3DGS attributes with\nimplicit geometry and appearance embeddings for finer non-rigid motion modeling\nwhile preserving the static hand characteristic modeled by original 3DGS\nattributes. Additionally, we introduce a local gradient-aware densification\nstrategy that dynamically refines Gaussian density in high-variation regions.\nTo improve stability, we incorporate pose-conditioned attribute regularization\nto encourage attribute consistency across similar poses, mitigating temporal\nartifacts. Extensive experiments on InterHand2.6M demonstrate that HandSplat\nsurpasses existing methods in fidelity and stability while achieving real-time\nperformance.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a new stochastic process of $N$ interacting\nparticles on the line that evolve via Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) with Dyson's\nindex $\\beta > 0$ and undergo simultaneous resetting to their initial positions\nat a constant rate $r$. We call this process the resetting Dyson Brownian\nmotion (RDBM) -- in short the $\\beta$-RDBM. For $\\beta = 1,2,4$, the positions\nof the particles in the RDBM can be interpreted as the eigenvalues of a random\nmatrix ensemble where the entries of an $N x N$ Gaussian matrix evolve as\nsimultaneously resetting Brownian motions (with rate $r$) in the presence or\nabsence of a harmonic trap. For $r=0$ and in the presence of a harmonic trap,\nthis system reaches an equilibrium Gibbs-Boltzmann state of the so called Dyson\nlog-gas. However, the stochastic resetting drives the system at long time to a\nnonequilibrium stationary state (NESS). We compute exactly the joint\ndistribution of the positions of the particles in this NESS for all $\\beta>0$\nand calculate several observables for large $N$: the average density profile of\nthe gas, the extreme value statistics, the spacing between two consecutive\nparticles and the full counting statistics. We show that a nonzero resetting\nrate $r>0$ drastically changes the nature of the fluctuations in the stationary\nstate: while the log-gas is rather rigid, the $\\beta$-RDBM in its NESS becomes\nfluffy, i.e., the fluctuations of different observables are of the same order\nas their mean. In the absence of a harmonic trap, our results for the $\\beta =\n2$-RDBM can be related to nonintersecting Brownian motions in the presence of\nresetting. Our model demonstrates interesting effects arising from the\ninterplay between the eigenvalue repulsion and the all-to-all attraction\n(generated by stochastic resetting) in an interacting particle system.\nNumerical simulations are in excellent agreement with our analytical results.",

We define cosmic web environment through\nboth dark matter densities averaged on a scale up to 16 Mpc/h, and through\ncosmic web location identified by applying DisPerSE to the CSiBORG haloes. We\ncorrelate these environmental measures with the properties of observed galaxies\nin large surveys using optical data (from the NASA-Sloan Atlas) and 21-cm radio\ndata (from ALFALFA). We find statistically significant correlations between\nenvironment and colour, neutral hydrogen gas (HI) mass fraction, star formation\nrate and S\\'ersic index. Together, these correlations suggest that bluer, star\nforming, HI rich, and disk-type galaxies tend to reside in lower density areas,\nfurther from filaments, while redder, more elliptical galaxies with lower star\nformation rates tend to be found in higher density areas, closer to filaments.\nWe find analogous trends with the quenching of galaxies, but notably find that\nthe quenching of low mass galaxies has a greater dependence on environment than\nthe quenching of high mass galaxies. We find that the relationship between\ngalaxy properties and the environmental density is stronger than that with\ndistance to filament, suggesting that environmental density has a greater\nimpact on the properties of galaxies than their location within the\nlarger-scale cosmic web.",

We present a scalable,\nstochastic-aware distribution system planning application that addresses these\nuncertainties by capturing spatial and temporal variability through a Markov\nmodel and conducting Monte Carlo simulations leveraging modular cloud-based\narchitecture. The results demonstrate that 15,000 power flow scenarios\ngenerated from the Markov model are completed on the modified IEEE 123-bus test\nfeeder, with each simulation representing an 8,760-hour time series run, all in\nunder an hour. The grid impact extracted from this huge volume of simulated\ndata provides insights into the spatial and temporal effects of adopted\ntechnology, highlighting that planning solely for average conditions is\ninadequate, while worst-case scenario planning may lead to prohibitive\nexpenses.",

    "abstract": "How is the limited capacity of working memory efficiently used to support\nhuman linguistic behaviors? In this paper, we propose Strategic Resource\nAllocation (SRA) as an efficiency principle for memory encoding in sentence\nprocessing. The idea is that working memory resources are dynamically and\nstrategically allocated to prioritize novel and unexpected information. From a\nresource-rational perspective, we argue that SRA is the principled solution to\na computational problem posed by two functional assumptions about working\nmemory, namely its limited capacity and its noisy representation. Specifically,\nworking memory needs to minimize the retrieval error of past inputs under the\nconstraint of limited memory resources, an optimization problem whose solution\nis to allocate more resources to encode more surprising inputs with higher\nprecision. One of the critical consequences of SRA is that surprising inputs\nare encoded with enhanced representations, and therefore are less susceptible\nto memory decay and interference. Empirically, through naturalistic corpus\ndata, we find converging evidence for SRA in the context of dependency locality\nfrom both production and comprehension, where non-local dependencies with less\npredictable antecedents are associated with reduced locality effect. However,\nour results also reveal considerable cross-linguistic variability, suggesting\nthe need for a closer examination of how SRA, as a domain-general memory\nefficiency principle, interacts with language-specific phrase structures. SRA\nhighlights the critical role of representational uncertainty in understanding\nmemory encoding. It also reimages the effects of surprisal and entropy on\nprocessing difficulty from the perspective of efficient memory encoding.",

This allows to have\nsufficient statistical polarization data to infer the magnetic field strength.\nThe magnetic field strength is derived using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi\nmethod. The underlying magnetic field strengths are approximately 2.0~mG for\nprotostars with a standard hourglass magnetic field morphology, which is higher\nthan the values derived for protostars with rotated hourglass, spiral, and\ncomplex magnetic field configurations ($\\lesssim1.0$~mG). This suggests that\nthe magnetic field plays a more significant role in envelopes exhibiting a\nstandard hourglass field morphology, and a value of $\\gtrsim2.0$ mG would be\nrequired to maintain such a structure at these scales. Furthermore, most\nprotostars in the sample are slightly supercritical, with mass-to-flux ratios\n$\\lesssim3.0$.

Computer vision presents an\ninnovative and powerful approach to predicting health risks through video\nmonitoring, employing human action recognition (HAR) technology.

This research proposes a real-time human action recognition model\nthat combines a deep learning model and a live video prediction and alert\nsystem, in order to predict falls, staggering and chest pain for residents in\nassisted living. Six thousand RGB video samples from the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset\nwere selected to create a dataset with four classes: Falling, Staggering, Chest\nPain, and Normal, with the Normal class comprising 40 daily activities.\nTransfer learning technique was applied to train four state-of-the-art HAR\nmodels on a GPU server, namely, UniFormerV2, TimeSformer, I3D, and SlowFast.\nResults of the four models are presented in this paper based on class-wise and\nmacro performance metrics, inference efficiency, model complexity and\ncomputational costs. TimeSformer is proposed for developing the real-time human\naction recognition model, leveraging its leading macro F1 score (95.33%),\nrecall (95.49%), and precision (95.19%) along with significantly higher\ninference throughput compared to the others.

Specifically, most existing studies\nevaluate security and functional correctness separately, using different\ndatasets. That is, they assess vulnerabilities using security-related code\ndatasets while validating functionality with general code datasets. In\naddition, prior research primarily relies on a single static analyzer, CodeQL,\nto detect vulnerabilities in generated code, which limits the scope of security\nevaluation.\n  In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study to systematically assess the\nimprovements introduced by four state-of-the-art secure code generation\ntechniques. Specifically, we apply both security inspection and functionality\nvalidation to the same generated code and evaluate these two aspects together.\nWe also employ three popular static analyzers and two LLMs to identify\npotential vulnerabilities in the generated code. Our study reveals that\nexisting techniques often compromise the functionality of generated code to\nenhance security. Their overall performance remains limited when evaluating\nsecurity and functionality together. In fact, many techniques even degrade the\nperformance of the base LLM. Our further inspection reveals that these\ntechniques often either remove vulnerable lines of code entirely or generate\n``garbage code'' that is unrelated to the intended task. Moreover, the commonly\nused static analyzer CodeQL fails to detect several vulnerabilities, further\nobscuring the actual security improvements achieved by existing techniques.

Most of them appear\novermassive relative to the stellar mass in their host systems, challenging\nmodels of early black hole seeding and growth. Multiple pathways exist to\nexplain their formation, including heavy seeds formed from direct\ncollapse/supermassive stars or sustained super-Eddington accretion onto light\nstellar remnant seeds. We use the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH to predict the\nemerging SMBH mass function under physically motivated models for both light\nand heavy seed formation, to be compared with upcoming ultra-deep JWST surveys.\nWe find that both pathways can reproduce observations at $z\\sim5-6$, but have\ndistinct features at higher redshifts of $z\\sim10$. Specifically, JWST\nobservations have the potential to constrain the fraction of efficiently\naccreting (super-Eddington) SMBHs, as well as the existence and prevalence of\nheavy seeds, in particular through ultra-deep observations of blank fields\nand/or gravitational lensing surveys. Such observations will provide key\ninsights to understand the process of SMBH formation and evolution during the\nemergence of the first galaxies.

    "abstract": "Learning long-term behaviors in chaotic dynamical systems, such as turbulent\nflows and climate modelling, is challenging due to their inherent instability\nand unpredictability. These systems exhibit positive Lyapunov exponents, which\nsignificantly hinder accurate long-term forecasting. As a result, understanding\nlong-term statistical behavior is far more valuable than focusing on short-term\naccuracy. While autoregressive deep sequence models have been applied to\ncapture long-term behavior, they often lead to exponentially increasing errors\nin learned dynamics. To address this, we shift the focus from simple prediction\nerrors to preserving an invariant measure in dissipative chaotic systems. These\nsystems have attractors, where trajectories settle, and the invariant measure\nis the probability distribution on attractors that remains unchanged under\ndynamics. Existing methods generate long trajectories of dissipative chaotic\nsystems by aligning invariant measures, but it is not always possible to obtain\ninvariant measures for arbitrary datasets. We propose the Poincare Flow Neural\nNetwork (PFNN), a novel operator learning framework designed to capture\nbehaviors of chaotic systems without any explicit knowledge of the invariant\nmeasure. PFNN employs an auto-encoder to map the chaotic system to a\nfinite-dimensional feature space, effectively linearizing the chaotic\nevolution. It then learns the linear evolution operators to match the physical\ndynamics by addressing two critical properties in dissipative chaotic systems:\n(1) contraction, the system's convergence toward its attractors, and (2)\nmeasure invariance, trajectories on the attractors following a probability\ndistribution invariant to the dynamics. Our experiments on a variety of chaotic\nsystems demonstrate that PFNN has more accurate predictions and physical\nstatistics compared to competitive baselines.",

To address these challenges, we introduce\nhistory-awareness, leveraging previous frames to reconstruct the scene and\nimprove quality and stability. We propose a hybrid splat-voxel feed-forward\nscene reconstruction approach that combines Gaussian Splatting to propagate\ninformation over time, with a hierarchical voxel grid for temporal fusion.\nGaussian primitives are efficiently warped over time using a motion graph that\nextends 2D tracking models to 3D motion, while a sparse voxel transformer\nintegrates new temporal observations in an error-aware manner.

Our\napproach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both static and streaming\nscene reconstruction, effectively reducing temporal artifacts and visual\nartifacts while running at interactive rates (15 fps with 350ms delay) on a\nsingle H100 GPU.

While reports of\ntheir challenges and limitations continue to accumulate, many studies remain\noptimistic based on small-scale, idealized testing setups, leaving doubt about\nthe scalability of VQAs for large-scale problems. We systematically investigate\nthis scaling behavior by analyzing how classical optimizers minimize\nvariational quantum loss functions for random QUBO instances in the presence of\nuncertainty, modeled as effective Gaussian noise. We find that the critical\nnoise threshold for successful optimization decreases rapidly as system size\ngrows. This decline exceeds what can be explained solely by shrinking loss\nvariance, confirming deeper, fundamental limitations in the loss landscapes of\nVQAs beyond barren plateaus. Translating these thresholds into required\nmeasurement shots reveals that achieving sufficient precision in the evaluated\nloss values quickly becomes impractical, even for moderately-sized problems.\nOur findings demonstrate serious scalability challenges for VQAs in\noptimization stemming from mere uncertainty, indicating potential barriers to\nachieving practical quantum advantage with current hybrid approaches.",

Finite-size effects are negligible due to the\nmesoscopic scale of the lattice sizes studied, with linear dimensions up to\n$L=2^{22}$ and $2^{19}$ for the Ising and Blume-Capel models, respectively. Our\nnumerical data, and the subsequent analysis, demonstrate a strong dynamic\nuniversality between the two models and provide the most precise estimate to\ndate of the dynamic critical exponent for this universality class, $z =\n2.1676(1)$. In the second protocol, we corroborate the role of the universal\nratio of dynamic and static length scales in achieving an exponential\nacceleration in the approach to equilibrium just \\emph{above} the critical\ntemperature, through a time-dependent variation of the thermal bath\ntemperature. The results presented in this work leverage our CUDA-based\nnumerical code, breaking the world record for the simulation speed of the Ising\nmodel.",

    "abstract": "Mass loss governs the evolution of massive stars and shapes the stellar\nsurroundings. To quantify the impact of the stellar winds we need to know the\nexact mass-loss rates; however, empirical constraints on the rates are hampered\nby limited knowledge of their small-scale wind structure or 'wind clumping'. We\naim to improve empirical constraints on the mass loss of massive stars by\ninvestigating the clumping properties of their winds, in particular the\nrelation between stellar parameters and wind structure. We analyse the optical\nand ultraviolet spectra of 25 O-type (super)giants in the LMC, using the model\natmosphere code Fastwind and a genetic algorithm. We derive stellar and wind\nparameters including detailed clumping properties, such as the amount of\nclumping, the density of the interclump medium, velocity-porosity of the\nmedium, and wind turbulence. We obtain stellar and wind parameters for 24 of\nour sample stars and find that the winds are highly clumped, with an average\nclumping factor of $f_{\\rm cl}=33\\pm14$, an interclump density factor of\n$f_{\\rm ic}=0.2\\pm0.1$, and moderate to strong velocity-porosity effects. The\nscatter around the average values of the wind-structure parameters is large.\nWith the exception of a significant, positive correlation between the\ninterclump density factor and mass loss, we find no dependence of clumping\nparameters on either mass-loss rate or stellar properties. In the luminosity\nrange that we investigate, the empirical and theoretical mass-loss rates both\nhave a scatter of about 0.5~dex, or a factor 3. Within this uncertainty, the\nempirical rates and the theoretical predictions agree. The origin of the\nscatter of the empirical mass-loss rates requires further investigation. It is\npossible that our description of wind clumping is still not sufficient to\ncapture effects of the structured wind; this could contribute to the scatter.",

    "abstract": "Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) provide a\nnew avenue to probe the cosmic expansion, in particular the Hubble constant\n$H_0$. The spectral sirens method is one of the most used techniques for GW\ncosmology. It consists of obtaining cosmological information from the GW\nluminosity distance, directly inferred from data, and the redshift that can be\nimplicitly obtained from the source frame mass distribution of the CBC\npopulation. With GW detectors, populations of CBCs can be either observed as\nresolved individual sources or implicitly as a stochastic gravitational-wave\nbackground (SGWB) from the unresolved ones. In this manuscript, we study how\nresolved and unresolved sources of CBCs can be employed in the spectral siren\nframework to constrain cosmic expansion. The idea stems from the fact that the\nSGWB can constrain additional population properties of the CBCs thus\npotentially improving the measurement precision of the cosmic expansion\nparameters. We show that with a 5-detector network at O5-designed sensitivity,\nthe inclusion of the SGWB will improve our ability to exclude low values of\n$H_0$ and the dark matter energy fraction $\\Omega_m$, while also improving the\ndetermination of a possible CBC peak in redshift. Although low values of $H_0$\nand $\\Omega_m$ will be better constrained, we obtain that most on the precsion\non $H_0$ will be provided by resolved spectral sirens. We also performed a\nspectral siren analysis for 59 resolved binary black hole sources detected\nduring the third observing run with an inverse false alarm rate higher than 1\nper year jointly with the SGWB. We obtain that with current sensitivities, the\ncosmological and population results are not impacted by the inclusion of the\nSGWB.",

Here, we assess the potential of\nthese new capabilities for space weather monitoring. These enhanced VLBI\ncapabilities were used to investigate interplanetary scintillation (IPS), a\nphenomenon caused by the scattering of radio waves due to density\nirregularities in the solar wind. Compact radio sources near the Sun were\nobserved using the AuScope VLBI array in Australia, which consists of 12-meter\ntelescopes at Hobart, Katherine, and Yarragadee. The baseline lengths between\nthese telescopes are approximately 3400 km (Hobart-Katherine), 3200 km\n(Hobart-Yarragadee), and 2400 km (Katherine-Yarragadee). The observations\ncovered solar elongations from 6.5$^\\circ$ to 11.3$^\\circ$ and frequencies\nbetween 3 and 13 GHz. The study focused on phase scintillation as an indicator\nof turbulence in the solar wind. As the solar elongation decreased, we observed\nan increase in the phase scintillation index, consistent with theoretical\nmodels. Importantly, the broadband system also detected IPS using relatively\nweak radio sources. Additionally, the phase scintillation increased with\nbaseline length, in agreement with Kolmogorov turbulence with an index of 11/3.\nThese findings demonstrate the effectiveness of geodetic broadband VLBI in\ncapturing detailed features of the solar wind. This capability enables\ncontinuous space weather monitoring and advances our understanding of solar and\ninterplanetary dynamics.",

Despite recent advancements,\nwe find that inconsistent--and sometimes flawed--evaluation protocols have been\napplied across studies. This not only impedes the understanding of current\nmethods but also hinders future advancements.\n  To address the issue, this paper introduces DPImageBench for DP image\nsynthesis, with thoughtful design across several dimensions: (1) Methods. We\nstudy eleven prominent methods and systematically characterize each based on\nmodel architecture, pretraining strategy, and privacy mechanism. (2)\nEvaluation. We include nine datasets and seven fidelity and utility metrics to\nthoroughly assess them. Notably, we find that a common practice of selecting\ndownstream classifiers based on the highest accuracy on the sensitive test set\nnot only violates DP but also overestimates the utility scores. DPImageBench\ncorrects for these mistakes. (3) Platform. Despite the methods and evaluation\nprotocols, DPImageBench provides a standardized interface that accommodates\ncurrent and future implementations within a unified framework. With\nDPImageBench, we have several noteworthy findings. For example, contrary to the\ncommon wisdom that pretraining on public image datasets is usually beneficial,\nwe find that the distributional similarity between pretraining and sensitive\nimages significantly impacts the performance of the synthetic images and does\nnot always yield improvements. In addition, adding noise to low-dimensional\nfeatures, such as the high-level characteristics of sensitive images, is less\naffected by the privacy budget compared to adding noise to high-dimensional\nfeatures, like weight gradients. The former methods perform better than the\nlatter under a low privacy budget.",

Our proofs are based on an adaptation of the classical\nBoundary Control method (BC-method) originally developed by Belishev and\nKurylev. The BC-method reduces the PDE-based problem to a purely geometric\nproblem involving the so-called travel time data. For each point in the\nmanifold the travel time data contains the distance function from this point to\nany point in a fixed \\textit{a priori} known compact observation set. It is\nwell known that this geometric problem is solvable. The main novelty of this\npaper lies in our strategy to recover the lower order terms via a further\nadaptation of the BC-method.",

    "abstract": "Entanglement is a key resource in many quantum information tasks. From a\nfundamental perspective entanglement is at the forefront of major philosophical\ndiscussions advancing our understanding of nature. An experimental scheme was\nproposed in 1989 by Franson that exploited the unpredictability in the\ngeneration time of a photon pair in order to produce a then new form of quantum\nentanglement, known as energy-time entanglement. A later modification gave rise\nto the very popular time-bin entanglement, an important cornerstone in many\nreal-world quantum communication applications. Both forms of entanglement have\nradically pushed forward our understanding of quantum mechanics throughout the\n1990s and 2000s. A decade later modifications to the original proposals were\nproposed and demonstrated, which opens the path for the highly sought-after\ndevice-independence capability for entanglement certification, with a goal of\nultra-secure quantum communication. In this review we cover the beginnings of\nenergy-time and time-bin entanglement, many key experiments that expanded our\nunderstanding of what was achievable in quantum information experiments all the\nway down to modern demonstrations based on new technological advances. We will\nthen point out to the future discussing the important place that energy-time\nand time-bin entanglement will have in upcoming quantum networks and novel\nprotocols based on nonlocality.",

On the one hand, we may have less data that\nunknowns, and on the other hand, even when we have as much data as unknowns,\nthe matrix connecting them may not be invertible, which makes the problem\nill-posed.\n  Besides developing the tools to solve the problem, we apply it to several\ntest cases to check the performance of the method. The results are quite\nsatisfactory.",

Due to the complex\nevolutionary history of the Milky Way, a variety of relics tracing different\nphenomena is expected to populate the Bulge: globular clusters formed in-situ\nor accreted from outside the Galaxy, nuclear star clusters of cannibalized\nstructures, and possibly a few remnants of the proto-bulge formation process\n(the so-called ``bulge fossil fragments\"). The signatures of the different\norigins are imprinted in the chemical properties of these stellar systems\nbecause specific abundance patterns provide authentic \"chemical DNA\" tests\nunivocally tracing the enrichment process and, therefore, the environment where\nthe stellar population formed. Thus, each system can provide a new piece of\ninformation on the bulge formation and evolutionary history. As first results\nof the survey, here we discuss the alpha-element and iron abundances of a\nsample of stars observed in the stellar system Liller 1, which is proposed to\nbe a bulge fossil fragment.

However, existing visual explanation methods can not display\nthe attention flow hidden inside the inner structure of ViT models, which\nexplains how the final attention regions are formed inside a ViT for its\ndecision-making. In this paper, a novel visual explanation approach, Dynamic\nAccumulated Attention Map (DAAM), is proposed to provide a tool that can\nvisualize, for the first time, the attention flow from the top to the bottom\nthrough ViT networks. To this end, a novel decomposition module is proposed to\nconstruct and store the spatial feature information by unlocking the [class]\ntoken generated by the self-attention module of each ViT block. The module can\nalso obtain the channel importance coefficients by decomposing the\nclassification score for supervised ViT models. Because of the lack of\nclassification score in self-supervised ViT models, we propose dimension-wise\nimportance weights to compute the channel importance coefficients. Such spatial\nfeatures are linearly combined with the corresponding channel importance\ncoefficients, forming the attention map for each block. The dynamic attention\nflow is revealed by block-wisely accumulating each attention map. The\ncontribution of this work focuses on visualizing the evolution dynamic of the\ndecision-making attention for any intermediate block inside a ViT model by\nproposing a novel decomposition module and dimension-wise importance weights.\nThe quantitative and qualitative analysis consistently validate the\neffectiveness and superior capacity of the proposed DAAM for not only\ninterpreting ViT models with the fully-connected layers as the classifier but\nalso self-supervised ViT models.

    "abstract": "Robot actions influence the decisions of nearby humans. Here influence refers\nto intentional change: robots influence humans when they shift the human's\nbehavior in a way that helps the robot complete its task. Imagine an autonomous\ncar trying to merge; by proactively nudging into the human's lane, the robot\ncauses human drivers to yield and provide space. Influence is often necessary\nfor seamless interaction. However, if influence is left unregulated and\nuncontrolled, robots will negatively impact the humans around them. Prior works\nhave begun to address this problem by creating a variety of control algorithms\nthat seek to influence humans. Although these methods are effective in the\nshort-term, they fail to maintain influence over time as the human adapts to\nthe robot's behaviors. In this paper we therefore present an optimization\nframework that enables robots to purposely regulate their influence over humans\nacross both short-term and long-term interactions. Here the robot maintains its\ninfluence by reasoning over a dynamic human model which captures how the\nrobot's current choices will impact the human's future behavior. Our resulting\nframework serves to unify current approaches: we demonstrate that\nstate-of-the-art methods are simplifications of our underlying formalism. Our\nframework also provides a principled way to generate influential policies: in\nthe best case the robot exactly solves our framework to find optimal,\ninfluential behavior. But when solving this optimization problem becomes\nimpractical, designers can introduce their own simplifications to reach\ntractable approximations. We experimentally compare our unified framework to\nstate-of-the-art baselines and ablations, and demonstrate across simulations\nand user studies that this framework is able to successfully influence humans\nover repeated interactions.

VBL enhances the visualization of PIC simulations\nby efficiently processing and rendering four main data types: point particles,\n1D lines, 2D textures, and 3D volumes. By utilizing interactive 3D\nvisualization, it overcomes the limitations of traditional 2D representations,\noffering enhanced spatial understanding and real-time manipulation of\nvisualization parameters such as time steps, data layers, colormaps. Users can\ninteractively explore the visualized data by moving their body or using a\ncontroller for navigation, zooming, and rotation. These interactive\ncapabilities improve data exploration and interpretation, making VBL a valuable\ntool for both scientific analysis and educational outreach. The visualizations\nare hosted online and freely accessible on our server, providing researchers,\nthe general public, and broader audiences with an interactive tool to explore\ncomplex plasma physics simulations. By offering an intuitive and dynamic\napproach to large-scale datasets, VBL enhances both scientific research and\nknowledge dissemination in high-intensity laser-matter physics.",

    "abstract": "We show that a replicated state machine (such as a blockchain protocol) can\nretain liveness in a strategic setting even while facing substantial ambiguity\nover certain events. This is implemented by a complementary protocol called\n\"Machine II\", which generates a non-ergodic value within chosen intervals such\nthat no limiting frequency can be observed. We show how to implement this\nmachine algorithmically and how it might be applied strategically as a\nmechanism for \"veiling\" actions. We demonstrate that welfare-enhancing\napplications for veiling exist for users belonging to a wide class of ambiguity\nattitudes, e.g. Binmore (2016), Gul and Pesendorfer (2014). Our approach is\nillustrated with applications to forking disputes in blockchain oracles and to\nConstant Function Market Makers, allowing the protocol to retain liveness\nwithout exposing their users to sure-loss.",

Phytoplankton motility is broadly categorized into swimming and\nbuoyancy regulation. Despite studies in the literature exploring the motility\ncosts and benefits of phytoplankton, there remains a gap in our integrative\nunderstanding of direct and indirect energy expenditures, starting from when an\norganism initiates movement due to any biophysical motive, to when the organism\nencounters intracellular and environmental challenges. Here we gather available\npieces of this puzzle from literature in biology, physics, and oceanography to\npaint an overarching picture of our current knowledge. The characterization of\nsinking and rising behavior as passive motility has resulted in the concept of\nsinking and rising internal efficiency being overlooked. We define this\nefficiency based on any energy dissipation associated with processes of mass\ndensity adjustment, as exemplified in structures like frustules and vacuoles.\nWe propose that sinking and rising are active motility processes involving\nnon-visible mechanisms, as species demonstrate active and rapid strategies in\nresponse to turbulence, predation risk, and gradients of nutrients, light,\ntemperature, and viscosity. Identifying intracellular buoyancy-regulating\ndissipative processes offers deeper insight into the motility costs relative to\nthe organism's total metabolic rate.",

Here, we present high-time-resolution\nlight curves from the Karl G.

Observations reveal 16 VLA and 3\nATCA flares of varying shapes and sizes, from a short (30 sec) spiky burst to a\nlong-duration ($\\sim$5 hr) decaying exponential. The Ku-band spectral index is\nfound to often evolve during flares. Both rising and falling spectra are\nobserved in the Ku-band, indicating optically thick and thin flares,\nrespectively. Estimations from optically thick radiation indicate higher\nloop-top magnetic field strengths ($\\sim$1 kG) and sustained electron densities\n($\\sim$10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) than previous observations of large M-dwarf flares.\nWe estimate the total kinetic energies of gyrating electrons in optically thin\nflares to be between 10$^{32}$ and 10$^{34}$ erg when the local magnetic field\nstrength is between 500 and 700 G.

Using a\nhigh-quality factor 3-D niobium cavity cooled through its superconducting\ntransition in controlled magnetic fields, we isolate vortex-induced losses and\nfind the resistive component of the sensitivity to trapped flux $S$ to be\napproximately 2~n$\\Omega$/mG at 10~mK and 6~GHz. The decay rate is initially\ndominated by two-level system (TLS) losses from the native niobium pentoxide,\nwith vortex-induced degradation of $T_1$ occurring above\n$B_{\\text{trap}}\\sim$~50~mG. In the absence of the oxide, even 10~mG of trapped\nflux limits performance $Q_0\\sim$~10$^{10}$, or $T_1\\sim$~350~ms, underscoring\nthe need for stringent magnetic shielding. The resistive sensitivity $S$\ndecreases with temperature and remains largely field-independent, whereas the\nreactive component, $S'$, exhibits a maximum near 0.8~K. These behaviors are\nwell modeled within the Coffey-Clem framework in the zero-creep limit, under\nthe assumption that vortex pinning is enhanced by thermally activated\nprocesses. Our results suggest that niobium-based transmon qubits can tolerate\nvortex-induced dissipation at trapped field levels up to several hundred mG,\nbut achieving long coherence times still requires careful magnetic shielding to\nsuppress lower-field losses from other mechanisms.",

Compared with classic Internet security, built upon\nuniversal abstractions such as domain names, origins, and certificates, this\nputs a significant burden on service users and providers. In particular, Web\nbrowsers and other legacy clients do not get the same security guaranties as\ncustom clients.\n  We present a new approach for users to establish trust in confidential\nservices. We propose attested DNS (aDNS): a name service that securely binds\nthe attested implementation of confidential services to their domain names.\nADNS enforces policies for all names in its zone of authority: any TEE that\nruns a service must present hardware attestation that complies with the\ndomain-specific policy before registering keys and obtaining certificates for\nany name in this domain. ADNS provides protocols for zone delegation, TEE\nregistration, and certificate issuance. ADNS builds on standards such as\nDNSSEC, DANE, ACME and Certificate Transparency. ADNS provides DNS transparency\nby keeping all records, policies, and attestations in a public append-only log,\nthereby enabling auditing and preventing targeted attacks.\n  We implement aDNS as a confidential service using a fault-tolerant network of\nTEEs. We evaluate it using sample confidential services that illustrate various\nTEE platforms. On the client side, we provide a generic browser extension that\nqueries and verifies attestation records before opening TLS connections, with\nnegligible performance overhead, and we show that, with aDNS, even legacy Web\nclients benefit from confidential computing as long as some enlightened clients\nverify attestations to deter or blame malicious actors.",

In this work, we study how local\nsymmetry-breaking impurities affect the dynamics of these correlation functions\nusing Brownian quantum circuits, which we expect to apply to generic\nnon-integrable systems with the same symmetries. While explicitly breaking the\nsymmetry is generally expected to lead to eventual restoration of full\nergodicity, we find that approximately conserved quantities that survive under\nsuch circumstances can still induce slow relaxation. This can be understood\nusing a super-Hamiltonian formulation, where low-lying excitations determine\nthe late-time dynamics and exact ground states correspond to conserved\nquantities. We show that in one dimension, symmetry-breaking impurities modify\ndiffusive and subdiffusive behaviors associated with U$(1)$ and dipole\nconservation at late-times, e.g., by increasing power-law decay exponents of\nthe decay of autocorrelation functions. This stems from the fact that for these\nsymmetries, impurities are relevant in the renormalization group sense, e.g.,\nbulk impurities effectively disconnect the system, completely modifying both\ntemporal and spatial correlations. On the other hand, for an impurity that\ndisrupts strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the super-Hamiltonian only\nacquires an exponentially small gap, leading to prethermal plateaus in\nautocorrelation functions which extend for times that scale exponentially with\nthe distance to the impurity. Overall, our approach systematically\ncharacterizes how symmetry breaking impurities affect relaxation dynamics in\nsymmetric systems.",

However, recent advances in our understanding of three-body binary\nformation (3BBF) -- new binary assembly by the gravitational scattering of\nthree unbound bodies (3UB) -- have shown that 3BBF in star clusters can\nefficiently generate wide, highly eccentric binaries. We further explore this\npossibility by constructing a semi-analytic model of the Galactic binary\npopulation in the solar neighborhood, originating from 3BBF in star clusters\nand subsequently migrating to the solar neighborhood within a Hubble time. The\nmodel relies on 3BBF scattering experiments to determine how the 3BBF rate and\nresulting binary properties scale with local stellar density, velocity\ndispersion, and physically-motivated limits to 3UB encounters within a\nclusters' tidal field. The Galactic star cluster population is modeled by\nincorporating up-to-date prescriptions for the Galaxy's star formation history\nas well as the birth properties and internal evolution of its star clusters.\nFinally, we account for binary disruption induced by perturbations from stellar\ninteractions before cluster dissolution and the subsequent changes and\ndisruption of binary orbital elements induced by dynamical interactions in the\nGalactic field.

Moreover, these expressions allow for the reconstruction of the\npropagator in the continuous circle limit, which exhibits in the free case a\npeculiar non-analytic behavior in its transition between irrational and\nrational times.

We study the effect of photolysis of refractory\ncarbon in the upper layers of the protosolar disk and its interplay with dust\ncollisional growth and vertical mixing. We make use of a 1D Monte Carlo model\nto simulate dust coagulation and vertical mixing. To model the FUV flux of the\ndisk, we use a simple analytical prescription and benchmark it with data from a\nradiative transfer simulation. We study the effects of fragmentation and\nbouncing on dust distribution and the propagation of carbon depletion. We find\nthat when bouncing is included, the size distribution is truncated at smaller\nsizes than fragmentation-limited size distributions but there is a loss of\nsmall grains as well. The population of small grains is reduced due to fewer\nfragmentation events and this reduces the effectiveness of photolysis. We find\nthat dust collisional growth and vertical mixing increase the effectiveness of\ncarbon depletion by efficiently replenishing carbon to the upper regions of the\ndisk with higher FUV flux. It takes around 100-300 kyr to reach the measured\ncarbon abundances at 1 au, depending on the strength of the turbulence in the\ndisk. These timescales are faster than reported by previous studies.\nCollisional redistribution and turbulent mixing are important aspects of dust\nevolution that should be included when modeling dust chemistry as they can\ninfluence the efficiency of chemical processes.

    "abstract": "We present the star formation histories (SFHs) of ten metal-poor (<12% Zsun),\nstar-forming dwarf galaxies from the Local Ultraviolet to Infrared Treasury\n(LUVIT) survey. The derived SFHs exhibit significant variability, consistent\nwith the irregular star formation expected for dwarf galaxies. Using synthetic\nnear ultraviolet (UV) and optical CMDs with various yet targeted configurations\nfor dust and input SFHs, we quantitatively demonstrate that simultaneous\nmodeling of the UV and optical CMDs (\"UVopt\" case) improves the precision of\nSFH measurements in recent time bins up to ~1 Gyr, compared to the classical\nsingle optical CMD modeling (\"Opt-only\" case). The UVopt case reduces\nuncertainties relative to the Opt-only case by ~4-8% over the past 10 Myr,\n~8-20% over 100 Myr, and ~8-14% over 1 Gyr, across various dust configurations\nand input SFHs. Additionally, we demonstrate discrepancies in stellar models\nfor blue core helium-burning (BHeB) stars at the low metallicity regime. This\ndiscrepancy can artificially inflate star formation rate (SFR) estimates in\nyounger age bins by misinterpreting the evolved BHeB stars as reddened upper\nmain-sequence (MS) stars. Incorporating UV data improves BHeB-MS separation and\nmitigates the limitations of current low metallicity stellar models.\nComparisons of the UVopt SFHs with Ha and FUV-based SFRs reconfirm that Ha is\nan unreliable tracer over its nominal 10 Myr timescale for low-SFR galaxies,\nwhile FUV provides a more reliable tracer but yields SFR_FUV values up to twice\nthose of CMD-based <SFR>_100Myr. Our findings underscore the importance of UV\ndata in refining recent SFHs in low-metallicity environments.",

The launch of the Einstein Probe (EP)\nmission has facilitated a rapid increase in the real-time discovery and\nfollow-up of FXTs. We focus on the recent EP discovered transient EP241021a,\nwhich shows a peculiar panchromatic behavior. We obtained optical and\nnear-infrared multi-band imaging and spectroscopy with the Fraunhofer Telescope\nat Wendelstein Observatory, the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, and the Very Large\nTelescope over the first 100 days of its evolution. EP241021a was discovered by\nEP as a soft X-ray trigger, but was not detected at gamma-ray frequencies. The\nobserved soft X-ray prompt emission spectrum is consistent with non-thermal\nradiation, which requires at least a mildly relativistic outflow with bulk\nLorentz factor $\\Gamma \\gtrsim 4$. The optical and near-infrared lightcurve has\na two component behavior where an initially fading component $\\sim t^{-1}$\nturns to a rise steeper than $\\sim t^{4}$ after a few days before peaking at\n$M_r\\approx -21.8$ mag and quickly returning to the initial decay. The peak\nabsolute magnitude is the most luminous optical emission associated to an FXT,\nsuperseding EP240414a. Standard supernova models are unable to reproduce either\nthe absolute magnitude or rapid timescale ($<2$ d) of the rebrightening. The\nX-ray, optical and near-infrared spectral energy distributions display a red\ncolor $r-J\\approx 0.8$ mag, and point to a non-thermal origin ($\\nu^{-1}$) for\nthe broadband emission. By considering a gamma-ray burst as a plausible\nscenario, we favor a refreshed shock as the cause of the rebrightening. This is\nconsistent with the inference of an at least mildly relativistic outflow based\non the prompt trigger. Our results suggest a link between EP discovered FXTs\nand gamma-ray bursts.",

Such squeezed states have been demonstrated in a wide\nvariety of artificial quantum systems ranging from atoms in optical cavities to\ntrapped ion crystals. By contrast, despite their numerous advantages as\npractical sensors, spin ensembles in solid-state materials have yet to be\ncontrolled with sufficient precision to generate targeted entanglement such as\nspin squeezing. In this work, we present the first experimental demonstration\nof spin squeezing in a solid-state spin system. Our experiments are performed\non a strongly-interacting ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in\ndiamond at room temperature, and squeezing (-0.5 $\\pm$ 0.1 dB) is generated by\nthe native magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between NVs. In order to generate\nand detect squeezing in a solid-state spin system, we overcome a number of key\nchallenges of broad experimental and theoretical interest. First, we develop a\nnovel approach, using interaction-enabled noise spectroscopy, to characterize\nthe quantum projection noise in our system without directly resolving the spin\nprobability distribution. Second, noting that the random positioning of spin\ndefects severely limits the generation of spin squeezing, we implement a pair\nof strategies aimed at isolating the dynamics of a relatively ordered\nsub-ensemble of NV centers. Our results open the door to entanglement-enhanced\nmetrology using macroscopic ensembles of optically active spins in solids.",

However, many of these\nmethods underutilize 3D spatial and temporal elements, relying mainly on image\ndata. As a result, their effectiveness in dynamic driving environments is\nlimited.

For varying intensity $u > 0$, the\nconnectivity properties of $\\mathcal V^u$ undergo a percolation phase\ntransition across a non-degenerate critical parameter $u_* \\in (0,\\infty)$. As\na consequence of the series of recent works arXiv:2308.07303, arXiv:2308.07919\nand arXiv:2308.07920, one knows that in the super-critical regime, i.e. when $u\n< u_\\ast$, there is a cluster of positive density inside any ball of radius $R$\nwith probability stretched exponentially close to $1$ in $R$. Furthermore, with\nsimilar probability, any two large clusters are connected to each other locally\nin any configuration with strictly smaller intensity. This last property falls\nshort of the classical local uniqueness, which requires a connection in the\nsame configuration, i.e. in absence of any sprinkling. In this article we\nresolve this question by proving a stronger property, namely that local\nuniqueness holds simultaneously for all configurations $\\mathcal{V}^{v}$ with\n$v \\le u$. Apart from the severe degeneracies in the conditional law of\n$\\mathcal{V}^u$ including the lack of any finite-energy property, our methods\nalso face up to the well-known problem of decoupling non-monotone events, by\nexhibiting a certain regularity in terms of so-called excursion packets, which\nhas implications beyond the scope of this paper. Our approach suggests a robust\nway to tackle similar problems for various other (correlated) models. In\nitself, the strong local uniqueness we prove yields several important results\ncharacterizing the super-critical phase of $\\mathcal{V}^u$, among which are the\nlarge-scale geometry of the infinite cluster and sharp upper bounds on\ntruncated connectivity functions.",

We experimentally demonstrate the partial shadow estimation scheme\nfor a wide class of two-qubit states (pure, entangled, and mixed) in the\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform, which relies on ensemble-based\nmeasurements. The full density matrix experimentally reconstructed by combining\ndifferent partial estimators produces fidelities exceeding 97%.",

It is expected that such assistants will be\nneeded to accelerate the identification of ways to address complex problems\nrequiring urgent solutions. In this paper, our focus is not on a specific\nscientific problem, but on the software-engineering of such 'science\naccelerators'. Recent developments in 'No Code' techniques would seem to\nsuggest that scientist can simply hypothesise solutions simply by conversing\nwith a large language model (LLM). However, for complex scientific problems,\nthis seems unlikely given the current state of LLM technology. What does appear\nfeasible is that a software engineer can use LLMs to rapidly construct programs\nfor use by a domain-specialist, including the specialist's requirements\nexpressed in natural language. We propose the design of an interactive form of\n'structured' inductive programming in which a software-engineer and an LLM\ncollaboratively construct an 'assistant' for a scientific data analysis. The\npaper describes a simple implementation called iStrucInd that adapts a '2-way\nIntelligibility' protocol to implement the interaction between the software\nengineer and the LLM. We test the tool on two different non-trivial scientific\ndata analysis tasks. Specifically, we compare the system constructed by\niStrucInd against systems constructed manually and by Low Code/No Code methods\nalong dimensions of: (a) program performance; (b) program quality; and (c)\nprogramming effort. The results show iStrucInd allows a software engineer to\ndevelop better programs faster suggesting interactive structured induction can\nplay a useful role in the rapid construction of scientific assistants.",

Gricean\nconversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear\ninstructions with cooperative principles. We propose a normative framework that\nintegrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks -- common ground, relevance\ntheory, and theory of mind -- into large language model (LLM) based agents. The\nnormative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation,\nand manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear\ninstructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant. Within\nthis framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to\ncollaborate with humans. To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI\ncollaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one\nwithout. In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve\nshared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear\nand unclear natural language instructions. Our results reveal that the Lamoid\nwith Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more\naccurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms.\nThis improvement stems from the normative framework, which enhances the agent's\npragmatic reasoning, fostering effective human-AI collaboration and enabling\ncontext-aware communication in LLM-based agents.",

The model for cluster evolution\nis comprised of a two-section cluster initial mass function, constant cluster\nformation rate, and a mass loss function. This mass loss function represents a\nsupervirial phase after gas expulsion, mass loss due to stellar evolution, and\ngradual dissolution driven by internal dynamics and the Galactic tidal field.\nWe construct different estimators of model fitness based on\n$\\chi^2$-statistics, the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) and a\nmaximum-likelihood approach. Using these estimators and Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo sampling, we obtain best-fit values and posterior distributions for a\nselection of model parameters. The KLD returns a superior model compared to the\nother statistics. The cluster initial mass function is well constrained and we\nfind a clear signature of an enhanced cluster mass loss in the first 50 Myr. In\nthe KLD best model, clusters lose 72% of their initial mass in the violent\nrelaxation phase, after which cluster mass loss slows down, allowing for a\nrelatively low rate of cluster formation of $0.088\\mathrm{M_\\odot kpc^{-2}\nGyr^{-1}}$. The observed upper limit of cluster ages at approx. 5 Gyr is\nreflected in the model by a shallow lifetime-mass relation for clusters with\ninitial masses above $1000\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$. The application of the model to an\nindependent cluster sample based on Gaia DR3 data yields similar results except\nfor a systematic shift in age.

    "abstract": "Creativity is a fundamental aspect of intelligence, involving the ability to\ngenerate novel and appropriate solutions across diverse contexts. While Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for their creative\ncapabilities, the assessment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in\nthis domain remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce\nCreation-MMBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the\ncreative capabilities of MLLMs in real-world, image-based tasks. The benchmark\ncomprises 765 test cases spanning 51 fine-grained tasks. To ensure rigorous\nevaluation, we define instance-specific evaluation criteria for each test case,\nguiding the assessment of both general response quality and factual consistency\nwith visual inputs. Experimental results reveal that current open-source MLLMs\nsignificantly underperform compared to proprietary models in creative tasks.\nFurthermore, our analysis demonstrates that visual fine-tuning can negatively\nimpact the base LLM's creative abilities. Creation-MMBench provides valuable\ninsights for advancing MLLM creativity and establishes a foundation for future\nimprovements in multimodal generative intelligence.

We propose Opti3DGS, a novel frequency-modulated\ncoarse-to-fine optimization framework that aims to minimize the number of\nGaussian primitives used to represent a scene, thus reducing memory and storage\ndemands. Opti3DGS leverages image frequency modulation, initially enforcing a\ncoarse scene representation and progressively refining it by modulating\nfrequency details in the training images. On the baseline 3DGS, we demonstrate\nan average reduction of 62% in Gaussians, a 40% reduction in the training GPU\nmemory requirements and a 20% reduction in optimization time without\nsacrificing the visual quality. Furthermore, we show that our method integrates\nseamlessly with many 3DGS-based techniques, consistently reducing the number of\nGaussian primitives while maintaining, and often improving, visual quality.\nAdditionally, Opti3DGS inherently produces a level-of-detail scene\nrepresentation at no extra cost, a natural byproduct of the optimization\npipeline.

    "abstract": "The thermal and electronic performance of atomically thin semiconductors, a\npromising group of materials for electronics, is underpinned by their\nvibrational (phonon) dynamics. However, surface phonons in layered materials\nremain poorly understood due to limitations in conventional experimental\ntechniques. We employ helium-3 spin-echo (HeSE) spectroscopy to measure the\nlowest energy (<10meV) dispersions of surface phonons on molybdenum disulfide\n(MoS2), a prototypical 2D semiconductor. We reveal that the widely studied E_2g\nand A_2u modes possess mixed acoustic-optical character, displaying unexpected\nquartic and quadratic dispersion relations, and finite-layer confinement to the\nsurface of 4-5 and 6 layers, respectively. Crucially, we find no evidence of\nany pure acoustic mode at the surface of MoS2. This suppresses anharmonic\nphonon decay processes, thereby limiting thermal transport and providing a\nmechanistic explanation for poor thermal conductivity in few-layer transition\nmetal dichalcogenides.",

In this work, we tackle image\nrestoration from a different perspective by jointly denoising multiple\nphotographs of the same scene. Our core hypothesis is that degraded images\ncapturing a shared scene contain complementary information that, when combined,\nbetter constrains the restoration problem. To this end, we implement a powerful\nmulti-view diffusion model that jointly generates uncorrupted views by\nextracting rich information from multi-view relationships.

    "abstract": "Hydrodynamic-like electron flows are typically modeled using the Stokes-Ohm\nequation or a kinetic description that is based on a dual-relaxation time\napproximation. Such models assume a short intrinsic mean free path $\\ell_e$ due\nto momentum-conserving electronic scattering and a large extrinsic mean free\npath $\\ell_\\text{MR}$ due to momentum-relaxing impurity scattering. This\nassumption, however, is overly simplistic and falls short at low temperatures,\nwhere it is known from exact diagonalization studies of the electronic\ncollision integral that another large electronic mean free path $\\ell_o$\nemerges, which describes long-lived odd electron modes -- this is sometimes\nknown as the tomographic effect. Here, using a matched asymptotic expansion of\nthe Fermi liquid kinetic equation that includes different electron relaxation\ntimes, we derive a general asymptotic theory for tomographic flows in arbitrary\nsmooth boundary geometries. Our key results are a set of governing equations\nfor the electron density and electron current, their slip boundary conditions\nand boundary layer corrections near diffuse edges. We find that the tomographic\neffect strongly modifies previous hydrodynamic theories for electron flows: In\nparticular, we find that (i) an equilibrium is established in the bulk, where\nthe flow is governed by Stokes-Ohm like equations with significant\nfinite-wavelength corrections, (ii) the velocity slip conditions for these\nequations are strongly modified from the widely-used hydrodynamic slip-length\ncondition (iii) a large kinetic boundary layer arises near diffuse boundaries\nof width $\\sim\\sqrt{\\ell_e \\ell_o}$, and (iv) all these effects are strongly\nsuppressed by an external magnetic field. We illustrate our findings for\nelectron flow in a channel. The equations derived here represent the\nfundamental governing equations for tomographic electron flow in arbitrary\nsmooth geometries.",

    "abstract": "Star formation is a fundamental, yet poorly understood, process of the\nUniverse. It is important to study how star formation occurs in different\ngalactic environments. Thus, here, in the first of a series of papers, we\nintroduce the Low-Metallicity Star Formation (LZ-STAR) survey of the Sh2-284\n(hereafter S284) region, which, at $Z\\sim 0.3-0.5Z_\\odot$, is one of the\nlowest-metallicity star-forming regions of our Galaxy. LZ-STAR is a\nmulti-facility survey, including observations with {\\it JWST}, {\\it ALMA}, {\\it\nHST}, {\\it Chandra} and {\\it Gemini}. As a starting point, we report {\\it JWST}\nand {\\it ALMA} observations of one of the most massive protostars in the\nregion, S284p1. The observations of shock-excited molecular hydrogen reveal a\nsymmetric, bipolar outflow originating from the protostar, spanning several\nparsecs, and fully covered by the {\\it JWST} field of view and the {\\it ALMA}\nobservations of CO(2-1) emission. This allows us to infer that the protostar\nhas maintained a relatively stable orientation of disk accretion over its\nformation history. The {\\it JWST} near-IR continuum observations detect a\ncentrally illuminated bipolar outflow cavity around the protostar, as well as a\nsurrounding cluster of low-mass young stars. We develop new radiative transfer\nmodels of massive protostars designed for the low metallicity of S284. Fitting\nthese models to the protostar's spectral energy distribution implies a current\nprotostellar mass of $\\sim10\\:M_\\odot$ has formed from an initially\n$\\sim100\\:M_\\odot$ core over the last $\\sim3\\times10^5$ years. Overall, these\nresults indicate that massive stars can form in an ordered manner in\nlow-metallicity, protocluster environments.",

A common strategy is to adjust for all available\ncovariates, yet this approach can yield biased treatment effect estimates,\nespecially when post-treatment or unobserved variables are present. We propose\nRAMEN, an algorithm that produces unbiased treatment effect estimates by\nleveraging the heterogeneity of multiple data sources without the need to know\nor learn the underlying causal graph. Notably, RAMEN achieves doubly robust\nidentification: it can identify the treatment effect whenever the causal\nparents of the treatment or those of the outcome are observed, and the node\nwhose parents are observed satisfies an invariance assumption. Empirical\nevaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach\noutperforms existing methods.",

We investigate its pockmarked morphology, characterized by\ncircular holes and rings, by examining the role of small-scale ejecta\nstructures interacting with a dense circumstellar shell. We adopted a\nneutrino-driven SN model to trace the evolution of its explosion from core\ncollapse to the age of the Cas A remnant using high-resolution 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations. Besides other processes, the simulations\ninclude self-consistent calculations of radiative losses, accounting for\ndeviations from electron-proton temperature equilibration and ionization\nequilibrium, as well as the ejecta composition derived from the SN. The GM's\nmorphology is reproduced by dense ejecta clumps and fingers interacting with an\nasymmetric, forward-shocked circumstellar shell. The clumps and fingers form by\nhydrodynamic instabilities growing at the interface between SN ejecta and\nshocked CSM. Radiative cooling accounting for effects of non-equilibrium of\nionization enhances the ejecta fragmentation, forming dense knots and thin\nfilamentary structures that penetrate the shell, producing a network of holes\nand rings with properties similar to those observed. The origin of the holes\nand rings in the GM can be attributed to the interaction of ejecta with a\nshocked circumstellar shell. By constraining the timing of this interaction and\nanalyzing the properties of these structures, we provide a distinction of this\nscenario from an alternative hypothesis, which attributes these features to\nfast-moving ejecta knots penetrating the shell ahead of the forward shock.",

    "abstract": "We use new cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary temperature and\npolarization anisotropy measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)\nData Release 6 (DR6) to test foundational assumptions of the standard\ncosmological model and set constraints on extensions to it. We derive\nconstraints from the ACT DR6 power spectra alone, as well as in combination\nwith legacy data from Planck. To break geometric degeneracies, we include ACT\nand Planck CMB lensing data and baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI\nYear-1, and further add supernovae measurements from Pantheon+ for models that\naffect the late-time expansion history. We verify the near-scale-invariance\n(running of the spectral index $d n_s/d\\ln k = 0.0062 \\pm 0.0052$) and\nadiabaticity of the primordial perturbations. Neutrino properties are\nconsistent with Standard Model predictions: we find no evidence for new light,\nrelativistic species that are free-streaming ($N_{\\rm eff} = 2.86 \\pm 0.13$,\nwhich combined with external BBN data becomes $N_{\\rm eff} = 2.89 \\pm 0.11$),\nfor non-zero neutrino masses ($\\sum m_\\nu < 0.082$ eV at 95% CL), or for\nneutrino self-interactions. We also find no evidence for self-interacting dark\nradiation ($N_{\\rm idr} < 0.134$), early-universe variation of fundamental\nconstants, early dark energy, primordial magnetic fields, or modified\nrecombination. Our data are consistent with standard BBN, the FIRAS-inferred\nCMB temperature, a dark matter component that is collisionless and with only a\nsmall fraction allowed as axion-like particles, a cosmological constant, and\nthe late-time growth rate predicted by general relativity. We find no\nstatistically significant preference for a departure from the baseline\n$\\Lambda$CDM model. In general, models introduced to increase the Hubble\nconstant or to decrease the amplitude of density fluctuations inferred from the\nprimary CMB are not favored by our data.",

    "abstract": "We present power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy\nin temperature and polarization, measured from the Data Release 6 maps made\nfrom Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. These cover 19,000 deg$^2$ of sky\nin bands centered at 98, 150 and 220 GHz, with white noise levels three times\nlower than Planck in polarization. We find that the ACT angular power spectra\nestimated over 10,000 deg$^2$, and measured to arcminute scales in TT, TE and\nEE, are well fit by the sum of CMB and foregrounds, where the CMB spectra are\ndescribed by the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Combining ACT with larger-scale Planck\ndata, the joint P-ACT dataset provides tight limits on the ingredients,\nexpansion rate, and initial conditions of the universe. We find similar\nconstraining power, and consistent results, from either the Planck power\nspectra or from ACT combined with WMAP data, as well as from either temperature\nor polarization in the joint P-ACT dataset. When combined with CMB lensing from\nACT and Planck, and baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR1, we measure\na baryon density of $\\Omega_b h^2=0.0226\\pm0.0001$, a cold dark matter density\nof $\\Omega_c h^2=0.118\\pm0.001$, a Hubble constant of $H_0=68.22\\pm0.36$\nkm/s/Mpc, a spectral index of $n_s=0.974\\pm0.003$, and an amplitude of density\nfluctuations of $\\sigma_8=0.813\\pm0.005$. Including the DESI DR2 data tightens\nthe Hubble constant to $H_0=68.43\\pm0.27$ km/s/Mpc; $\\Lambda$CDM parameters\nagree between the P-ACT and DESI DR2 data at the $1.6\\sigma$ level. We find no\nevidence for excess lensing in the power spectrum, and no departure from\nspatial flatness. The contribution from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) anisotropy is\ndetected at high significance; we find evidence for a tilt with suppressed\nsmall-scale power compared to our baseline SZ template spectrum, consistent\nwith hydrodynamical simulations with feedback.",

In particular, these arguments rely on controllability\nresults in the group of the diffeomorphisms of $M$. On the other hand, using\ntools of $\\Gamma$-convergence, it has been proved that we can phrase the\nretrieval of a diffeomorphism of $M$ as an ensemble optimal control problem.\nMore precisely, this is done by employing a control-affine system for\n\\emph{simultaneously} steering a finite swarm of points towards the respective\ntargets. Here we blend these two theoretical approaches and numerically find\ncontrol laws driving state transitions (such as eigenstate transfers) in small\ntime in a bilinear Schr\\\"odinger PDE posed on the torus. Such systems have\nexperimental relevance and are currently used to model rotational dynamics of\nmolecules, and cold atoms trapped in periodic optical lattices.",

These\ndevices are pivotal in enabling a wide range of applications from quantum\ncomputing and sensing to advanced communication systems. Although linear\ninterferometers with full programmability have been realized with up to 32\nmodes, scaling to hundreds of modes is hampered by exponential increases in\noptical losses with circuit depth. Here we present and experimentally\ndemonstrate highly scalable, low-loss multimode squeezed light interferometer\nschemes, capitalizing on measurement-induced operations and a shallow circuit\napproach. We validate our approach through a 6-mode interferometer and\nsubsequently demonstrate its scalability by extending the design to 400 modes.\nThis development marks a step toward realizing large-scale Noisy\nIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) algorithm applications, employing shallow\ncircuits and addressing the prevalent issue of optical losses in photonic\nquantum information processing.",

When estimating parameters of the log-logistic\ndistribution, hypothesis testing is necessary to verify assumptions about these\nparameters. The Wald test and Rao test provide formal methods for testing\nhypotheses about these parameters. However, these test statistics are not\nrobust, and their rejection decisions may be affected by data contamination. In\nthis paper we develop new families of Wald-type test statistics and Rao-type\ntest statistics based on minimum density power divergence estimators (MDPDEs)\nfor the parameters of the log-logistic distribution. These new families\ngeneralize the Wald and Rao test statistics, inheriting the robustness\nproperties from the MDPDEs and thus addressing the lack of robustness of the\nclassical tests. Explicit expressions for the test statistics under the\nlog-logistic model for both simple and composite null hypotheses are derived,\nand their properties are analyzed in detail. An extensive simulation study\nempirically demonstrates the robustness of these families and compares their\nperformance with the classical methods.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with specialized\nexternal tools, yet many tasks demand zero-shot tool usage with minimal or\nnoisy documentation. Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled\ndata for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To\naddress these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that\nsystematically \"plays\" with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors.\nThrough this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool\ndocumentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These\nexamples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further\nenhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate\nthat PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both\nopen and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for\ndomain-specific tool integration.",

    "abstract": "Hydrodynamics is a new paradigm of electron transport in high-mobility\ndevices, where frequent electron collisions give rise to a collective electron\nflow profile. However, conventional descriptions of these flows, which are\nbased on the fluid equations for a classical gas extended to include impurity\nscattering, do not account for the distinct collisional relaxation in\nquantum-mechanical systems. In particular, by dint of Pauli blocking even modes\nof the distribution function relax over significantly shorter length scales\nthan odd modes (dubbed the ``tomographic'' effect). We establish an analytical\ndescription of tomographic electron flow in a channel, and find four new\ndistinguishing features: (i) Non-equilibrium effects from the boundaries\npenetrate significantly deeper into the flow domain; (ii) an additional\nvelocity slip condition leads to a significant increase in the channel\nconductance; (iii) bulk rarefaction corrections decrease the curvature of the\nvelocity profile in the channel center; and (iv) all these anomalous transport\neffects are rapidly suppressed with magnetic fields. The latter effect leads to\na non-monotonic magneto-conductance, which can be used to measure both the\neven- and odd-mode mean free paths. Our asymptotic results unveil the\nunderlying physics of tomographic flows and provide an alternative to numerical\nsolutions of the Fermi-liquid equations.",

Furthermore, MagicComp is a model-agnostic\nand versatile approach, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing T2V\narchitectures. Extensive experiments on T2V-CompBench and VBench demonstrate\nthat MagicComp outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential\nfor applications such as complex prompt-based and trajectory-controllable video\ngeneration.

However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich\ntextual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs).\nSuch combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures\nintroduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and\nrely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural\ninformation, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the\nessential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic\nreinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \\textbf{CROSS}, a flexible\nframework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. CROSS is\ndesigned by decomposing the TTAG modeling process into two phases: (i) temporal\nsemantics extraction; and (ii) semantic-structural information unification. The\nkey idea is to advance the large language models (LLMs) to dynamically extract\nthe temporal semantics in text space and then generate cohesive representations\nunifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal\nSemantics Extractor in the CROSS framework, which empowers LLMs to offer the\ntemporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual\nneighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the\nSemantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for\nsynthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic\nand structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement.\nExtensive experiments show that CROSS achieves state-of-the-art results on four\npublic datasets and one industrial dataset, with 24.7% absolute MRR gain on\naverage in temporal link prediction and 3.7% AUC gain in node classification of\nindustrial application.",

Most existing methods adopted deep feature-based\nor score-based guidance for generation models to conduct FAE. Although these\nmethods achieved promising results, they potentially produced excessively\nbeautified results with lower identity consistency or insufficiently improved\nfacial attractiveness. To enhance facial aesthetics with less loss of identity,\nwe propose the Nearest Neighbor Structure Guidance based on Diffusion\n(NNSG-Diffusion), a diffusion-based FAE method that beautifies a 2D facial\nimage with 3D structure guidance. Specifically, we propose to extract FAE\nguidance from a nearest neighbor reference face. To allow for less change of\nfacial structures in the FAE process, a 3D face model is recovered by referring\nto both the matched 2D reference face and the 2D input face, so that the depth\nand contour guidance can be extracted from the 3D face model. Then the depth\nand contour clues can provide effective guidance to Stable Diffusion with\nControlNet for FAE. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is\nsuperior to previous relevant methods in enhancing facial aesthetics while\npreserving facial identity.",

    "abstract": "We study the evolution of majority dynamics on Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi $G(n,p)$\nrandom graphs. In this process, each vertex of a graph is assigned one of two\ninitial states. Subsequently, on every day, each vertex simultaneously updates\nits state to the most common state in its neighbourhood.\n  If the difference in the numbers of vertices in each state on day $0$ is\nlarger than $ \\max \\left\\{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{p}} \\exp\\left[A\\sqrt{\\log\n\\left(\\frac{1}{p}\\right)}\\right] , Bp^{-3/2} n^{-1/2} \\right\\}$ for constants\n$A$ and $B$, we demonstrate that the state with the initial majority wins with\noverwhelmingly high probability. This extends work by Linh Tran and Van Vu\n(2023), who previously considered this phenomenon.\n  We also study majority dynamics with a random initial assignment of vertex\nstates. When each vertex is assigned to a state with equal probability, we show\nthat unanimity occurs with high probability for every $p \\geq \\lambda\nn^{-2/3}$, for some constant $\\lambda$. This improves work by Fountoulakis,\nKang and Makai (2020).\n  Furthermore, we also consider a random initial assignment of vertex states\nwhere a vertex is slightly more likely to be in the first state than the second\nstate. Previous work by Zehmakan (2018) and Tran and Vu (2023) provided\nconditions on how big this bias needs to be for the first colour to achieve\nunanimity with high probability. We strengthen these results by providing a\nweaker sufficient condition.",

We\npresent a weakly supervised spatial implicit neural representation (SINR)\nmethod to address modality differences and pelvic anatomy challenges.\n  Methods: The framework uses sparse surface supervision from MRI/US\nsegmentations instead of dense intensity matching. SINR models deformations as\ncontinuous spatial functions, with patient-specific surface priors guiding a\nstationary velocity field for biologically plausible deformations. Validation\nincluded 20 public Prostate-MRI-US-Biopsy cases and 10 institutional HDR cases,\nevaluated via Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean surface distance (MSD),\nand 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95).\n  Results: The proposed method achieved robust registration.

Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) During a\ncritical phase in training, Likra with negative examples demonstrates a\nsignificantly larger improvement per training example compared to SFT using\nonly positive examples. This leads to a sharp jump in the learning curve for\nLikra unlike the smooth and gradual improvement of SFT; (2) negative examples\nthat are plausible but incorrect (near-misses) exert a greater influence; and\n(3) while training with positive examples fails to significantly decrease the\nlikelihood of plausible but incorrect answers, training with negative examples\nmore accurately identifies them.

    "abstract": "Oxygen resonant inelastic X-ray scattering has become a prominent tool for\nunveiling the electronic structure of solids, especially redox mechanisms in\nLi-rich cathode materials. A number of studies have observed a strong\nabsorption feature at 531 eV associated with the anomalous capacity of Li-rich\ncathodes. The most prominent emission feature arising from absorption at 531 eV\noccurs at 523 eV and has been attributed to the $^3\\Pi_\\text{g}$ final state of\nmolecular O$_2$. However, in many materials, this feature exhibits a secondary\nemission peak at a loss of 4.3 eV loss which is not seen in the spectrum of\ngas-phase oxygen. This study revisits the spectra of these materials and\ninvestigates transitions that are forbidden for an isolated O$_2$ molecule as a\npossible explanation for the secondary emission peak. A group theoretic\nanalysis and simulation of RIXS cross-sections suggest that this feature is\nconsistent with molecular oxygen in a low-symmetry environment owing to final\nstates descending from the $^3\\Sigma_\\text{u}^+$ and $^3\\Delta_\\text{u}$ states\nof isolated O$_2$. Vibronic coupling and multi-molecule transitions are also\ndiscussed as possible mechanisms for enabling transitions to these final states\neven in a high-symmetry environment.

Furthermore, we introduce a cross-scatter kernel superposition (xSKS)\nmodule to enhance the accuracy of cross-scatter estimation by modeling both\nsingle and multiple crossscatter events along non-primary paths. Additionally,\nwe employ a fast object-adaptive scatter kernel superposition (FOSKS) module\nfor efficient forward scatter estimation. In Monte Carlo (MC) simulation\nexperiments performed on a custom-designed waterbone phantom, our model\ndemonstrated remarkable superiority, achieving a scatter-toprimary-weighted\nmean absolute percentage error (SPMAPE) of 1.32%, significantly lower than the\n12.99% attained by the state-of-the-art method. Physical experiments further\nvalidate the superior performance of our model in correcting scatter artifacts.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines how various categories of Ethereum stakers respond to\nchanges in the consensus issuance schedule, and the potential impact of such\nchanges on the composition of the staking market. To this end, we have develop\nand calibrate a game-theoretic model of the Ethereum staking market,\nincorporating strategic interactions between various staking agents. Our\nfindings suggest that solo stakers may be more sensitive to variations in\nstaking rewards than ETH holders using centralized exchanges or liquid staking\nproviders. This increased sensitivity is driven not only by the cost structure\nof solo staking, but also by the competitive dynamics between different staking\nsolutions in the market. When faced with a downward-sloping issuance schedule,\nstaking agents compete for limited staking yields, and their choice of staking\nsupply affects the revenues of other stakers. Therefore, the presence of other\nstaking methods with access to MEV revenues and other DeFi yield sources when\nstaking, as well as inattentive stakers, puts competitive pressure on solo\nstakers. Consequently, our model predicts that a reduction in issuance is\nlikely to crowd out solo stakers. We present preliminary empirical evidence to\nsupport this result, using an instrumental variable estimation approach to\nestimate the yield elasticity of staking supply for different staking\ncategories.",

    "abstract": "Unveiling universal non-equilibrium scaling laws has been a central theme in\nmodern statistical physics, with recent attention increasingly directed toward\nnonequilibrium phases that exhibit rich dynamical phenomena. A striking example\narises in nonreciprocal systems, where asymmetric interactions between\ncomponents lead to inherently dynamic phases and unconventional criticality\nnear a critical exceptional point (CEP), where the criticality arises from the\ncoalescence of collective modes to the Nambu-Goldstone mode. However, the\nuniversal scaling behavior that should emerge in this system with full\nconsideration of many-body effects and stochastic noise remains largely\nelusive. Here, we establish a dynamical scaling law in a generic\none-dimensional stochastic nonreciprocal $O(2)$-symmetric system. Through\nlarge-scale simulations, we uncover a new nonequilibrium scaling in the\nvicinity of transition, distinct from any previously known equilibrium or\nnonequilibrium universality classes. In regimes where the system breaks into\ndomains with opposite chirality, we demonstrate that fluctuations are strongly\nsuppressed, leading to a logarithmic scaling as a function of system size $L$,\nin contrast to the conventional power-law scaling expected from dynamical\nscaling theory. This work elucidates the beyond-mean-field dynamics of\nnon-reciprocal matter, thereby sheding light on the exploration of criticality\nin nonreciprocal phase transition across diverse physical contexts, from active\nmatter and driven quantum systems to biological pattern formation and\nnon-Hermitian physics.",

This paper explores optimizing high-dimensional\n$s$-sparse oblique splits from $\\{(\\vec{w}, \\vec{w}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{X}_{i}) :\ni\\in \\{1,\\dots, n\\}, \\vec{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^p, \\| \\vec{w} \\|_{2} = 1, \\|\n\\vec{w} \\|_{0} \\leq s \\}$ for growing oblique trees, where $ s $ is a\nuser-defined sparsity parameter. We establish a connection between SID\nconvergence and $s_0$-sparse oblique splits with $s_0\\ge 1$, showing that the\nSID function class expands as $s_0$ increases, enabling the capture of more\ncomplex data-generating functions such as the $s_0$-dimensional XOR function.\nThus, $s_0$ represents the unknown potential complexity of the underlying\ndata-generating function. Learning these complex functions requires an\n$s$-sparse oblique tree with $s \\geq s_0$ and greater computational resources.\nThis highlights a trade-off between statistical accuracy, governed by the SID\nfunction class size depending on $s_0$, and computational cost. In contrast,\nprevious studies have explored the problem of SID convergence using orthogonal\nsplits with $ s_0 = s = 1 $, where runtime was less critical. Additionally, we\nintroduce a practical framework for oblique trees that integrates optimized\noblique splits alongside orthogonal splits into random forests.

The emerging era of\ndata-driven methods, Large Language Models (LLMs), and AI-based controllers\ndoes not indicate a weakness in well-established control theory. Instead, it\naims to reduce dependence on models and uncertainties, address increasingly\ncomplex systems, and potentially achieve decision-making capabilities\ncomparable to human-level performance. This revolution integrates knowledge\nfrom computer science, machine learning, biology, and classical control,\nproducing promising algorithms that are yet to demonstrate widespread\nreal-world applicability. Despite the maturity of control theory and the\npresence of various performance criteria, there is still a lack of standardised\nmetrics for testing, evaluation, Verification and Validation ($V\\&V$) of\nalgorithms. This gap can lead to algorithms that, while optimal in certain\naspects, may fall short of practical implementation, sparking debates within\nthe literature. For a controller to succeed in real-world applications, it must\nsatisfy three key categories of performance metrics: tracking quality, control\neffort (energy consumption), and robustness. This paper rather takes an applied\nperspective, proposing and consolidating standard performance criteria for\ntesting and analysing control systems, intended for researchers and students.\nThe proposed framework ensures the post-design applicability of a black-box\nalgorithm, aligning with modern data analysis and $V\\&V$ perspectives to\nprevent resource allocation to systems with limited impact or imprecise claims.",

    "abstract": "Sequential social dilemmas pose a significant challenge in the field of\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), requiring environments that\naccurately reflect the tension between individual and collective interests.\nPrevious benchmarks and environments, such as Melting Pot, provide an\nevaluation protocol that measures generalization to new social partners in\nvarious test scenarios. However, running reinforcement learning algorithms in\ntraditional environments requires substantial computational resources. In this\npaper, we introduce SocialJax, a suite of sequential social dilemma\nenvironments and algorithms implemented in JAX. JAX is a high-performance\nnumerical computing library for Python that enables significant improvements in\noperational efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that the SocialJax training\npipeline achieves at least 50\\texttimes{} speed-up in real-time performance\ncompared to Melting Pot RLlib baselines. Additionally, we validate the\neffectiveness of baseline algorithms within SocialJax environments. Finally, we\nuse Schelling diagrams to verify the social dilemma properties of these\nenvironments, ensuring that they accurately capture the dynamics of social\ndilemmas.",

Despite this remarkable theoretical development and the\nsubsequent experimental observation of the phenomena in KCuF3, real materials\nare often imperfect and contain integrability breaking interactions.\nUnderstanding the effect of such terms on the superdiffusion is crucial in\nidentifying connections to such materials. Current quantum hardware has already\nascertained its utility in studying such non-equilibrium phenomena by\nsimulating the superdiffusion of the 1D Heisenberg model. In this work, we\nperform a quantum simulation of the superdiffusion breakdown by generalizing\nthe superdiffusive Floquet-type 1D model to a general 2D model. We\ncomprehensively study the effect of different 2D interactions on the\nsuperdiffusion breakdown by tuning up their strength from zero, corresponding\nto the 1D Heisenberg chain, to higher values. We observe that certain 2D\ninteractions are more resilient against superdiffusion breakdown than the\nothers and that the SU(2) preserving 2D interaction has the highest resilience\namong all the 2D interactions we study. We observe that the location and\nmultitude of the 2D interactions of a certain type do not change the relative\nresilience, but simply affect the time of onset of the breakdown. The\nsuperdiffusion breakdown was also captured in quantum hardware with a\nremarkable accuracy, further establishing the quantum computer's applicability\nin simulating interesting non-equilibrium quantum many-body phenomena.",

    "abstract": "The field of scientific machine learning and its applications to numerical\nanalyses such as CFD has recently experienced a surge in interest. While its\nviability has been demonstrated in different domains, it has not yet reached a\nlevel of robustness and scalability to make it practical for industrial\napplications in the turbomachinery field. The highly complex, turbulent, and\nthree-dimensional flows of multi-stage axial compressors for gas turbine\napplications represent a remarkably challenging case. This is due to the\nhigh-dimensionality of the regression of the flow-field from geometrical and\noperational variables, and the high computational cost associated with the\nlarge scale of the CFD domains. This paper demonstrates the development and\napplication of a generalized deep learning framework for predictions of the\nflow field and aerodynamic performance of multi-stage axial compressors, also\npotentially applicable to any type of turbomachinery. A physics-based\ndimensionality reduction unlocks the potential for flow-field predictions for\nlarge-scale domains, re-formulating the regression problem from an unstructured\nto a structured one. The relevant physical equations are used to define a\nmulti-dimensional physical loss function. Compared to \"black-box\" approaches,\nthe proposed framework has the advantage of physically explainable predictions\nof overall performance, as the corresponding aerodynamic drivers can be\nidentified on a 0D/1D/2D/3D level. An iterative architecture is employed,\nimproving the accuracy of the predictions, as well as estimating the associated\nuncertainty. The model is trained on a series of dataset including\nmanufacturing and build variations, different geometries, compressor designs\nand operating conditions. This demonstrates the capability to predict the\nflow-field and the overall performance in a generalizable manner, with accuracy\ncomparable to the benchmark.",

Despite its importance, no\ndirect observational constraints on the Stream's distance have been previously\npublished. In this study, we analyze Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and\nVisual Echelle Spectrograph (VLT/UVES) spectra of five blue horizontal branch\n(BHB) stars in the MW halo located at distances ranging from 13 to 56 kpc near\ntwo regions of the Stream (near Stream longitudes of -79 and -98 degrees), with\nthe aim of detecting Ca II and Na I absorption. No Ca II or Na I absorption is\ndetected at Stream velocities in any of the individual spectra, or in higher\nsignal-to-noise stacks of the spectra. The resulting limits on the Ca II\nabsorption are significantly lower than the Ca II columns measured in the\nStream along extragalactic sightlines. These non-detections establish a firm\nlower distance limit of 42 kpc for one region of the Stream. For the other\nregion, we set a firm lower limit of 20 kpc and a tentative lower limit of 55\nkpc from the most distant star, but deeper spectra are needed to confirm this.\nOur results provide the first observational constraints on the gaseous Stream's\ndistance.",

    "abstract": "Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer a promising approach to solving\ncomputationally demanding problems by combining parameterized quantum circuits\nwith classical optimization. Estimating probabilistic outcomes on quantum\nhardware requires repeated measurements (shots). However, in practice, the\nlimited shot budget introduces significant noise in the evaluation of the\nobjective function. Gradient estimation in VQAs often relies on the\nfinite-difference, which evaluates the noisy objective function at perturbed\ncircuit parameter values. The accuracy of this estimation is highly dependent\non the choice of step size for these perturbations. An inappropriate step size\ncan exacerbate the impact of noise, causing inaccurate gradient estimates and\nhindering the classical optimization in VQAs. This paper proposes QuGStep, an\nalgorithm that addresses the challenge of determining the appropriate step size\nfor finite-difference gradient estimation under a shot budget. QuGStep is\ngrounded in a theorem that proves the optimal step size, which accounts for the\nshot budget, minimizes the error bound in gradient estimation using finite\ndifferences. Numerical experiments approximating the ground state energy of\nseveral molecules demonstrate that QuGStep can identify the appropriate step\nsize for the given shot budget to obtain effective gradient estimation.\nNotably, the step size identified by QuGStep achieved convergence to the ground\nstate energy with over 94% fewer shots compared to using a default step size\n(i.e., step size of 0.01). These findings highlight the potential of QuGStep to\nimprove the practical deployment and scalability of quantum computing\ntechnologies.",

Our capture rig supports multi-view video-audio\ncapture while on the move, a capability absent in existing datasets,\nsignificantly enhancing the completeness, flexibility, and efficiency of data\ncapture.\n  The captured multi-view videos (with synchronized audios) are in 5K\nresolution at 60FPS, lasting from 1-5 minutes, and include rich\nforeground-background elements, and complex dynamics. We benchmark existing\nmethods using our dataset and establish a base pipeline for constructing\nimmersive volumetric videos from multi-view audiovisual inputs for 6-DoF\nmulti-modal immersive VR experiences. The benchmark and the reconstruction and\ninteraction results demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and baseline\nmethod, which we believe will stimulate future research on immersive volumetric\nvideo production.",

In this paper we aim to address these gaps. First, we introduce RFMI, a\nnovel Mutual Information (MI) estimator for RF models that uses the pre-trained\nmodel itself for the MI estimation. Then, we investigate a self-supervised\nfine-tuning approach for T2I alignment based on RFMI that does not require\nauxiliary information other than the pre-trained model itself. Specifically, a\nfine-tuning set is constructed by selecting synthetic images generated from the\npre-trained RF model and having high point-wise MI between images and prompts.\nOur experiments on MI estimation benchmarks demonstrate the validity of RFMI,\nand empirical fine-tuning on SD3.5-Medium confirms the effectiveness of RFMI\nfor improving T2I alignment while maintaining image quality.",

In this context, the bag-of-vectors representation\ncan be leveraged to describe complex objects through discrete distributions,\nand the Wasserstein distance can effectively measure the dissimilarity between\nthem. Additionally, kernel methods can be used to embed data into feature\nspaces that are easier to analyze. Despite significant progress in data\nclustering, a method that simultaneously accounts for distributional and\nvectorial dissimilarity measures is still lacking. To tackle this gap, this\nwork explores kernel methods and Wasserstein distance metrics to develop a\ncomputationally tractable clustering framework. The compositional properties of\nkernels allow the simultaneous handling of different metrics, enabling the\nintegration of both vectors and discrete distributions for object\nrepresentation. This approach is flexible enough to be applied in various\ndomains, such as graph analysis and image processing. The framework consists of\nthree main components.

Second, we employ kernel\nfunctions based on Wasserstein distances and present ways of composing kernels\nto express different types of information. Finally, we use the kernels to\ncluster data and evaluate the quality of the results using scalable and\ndistance-agnostic validity indices.

Conventional analytical methods focus on\ntransforming sequences into numerical representations for applying machine\nlearning/deep learning-based sequence characterization. However, their efficacy\nis constrained by the intrinsic nature of deep learning (DL) models, which tend\nto exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to tabular data. An alternative\ngroup of methodologies endeavors to convert biological sequences into image\nforms by applying the concept of Chaos Game Representation (CGR).

    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-speech synthesis have achieved notable success in\ngenerating high-quality short utterances for individual speakers. However,\nthese systems still face challenges when extending their capabilities to long,\nmulti-speaker, and spontaneous dialogues, typical of real-world scenarios such\nas podcasts. These limitations arise from two primary challenges: 1) long\nspeech: podcasts typically span several minutes, exceeding the upper limit of\nmost existing work; 2) spontaneity: podcasts are marked by their spontaneous,\noral nature, which sharply contrasts with formal, written contexts; existing\nworks often fall short in capturing this spontaneity. In this paper, we propose\nMoonCast, a solution for high-quality zero-shot podcast generation, aiming to\nsynthesize natural podcast-style speech from text-only sources (e.g., stories,\ntechnical reports, news in TXT, PDF, or Web URL formats) using the voices of\nunseen speakers. To generate long audio, we adopt a long-context language\nmodel-based audio modeling approach utilizing large-scale long-context speech\ndata. To enhance spontaneity, we utilize a podcast generation module to\ngenerate scripts with spontaneous details, which have been empirically shown to\nbe as crucial as the text-to-speech modeling itself.

First, we extend the $k$-WL test for\ngraphons (B\\\"oker, 2023) to the graphon-signal space and introduce\nsignal-weighted homomorphism densities as a key tool. As an exemplary focus, we\ngeneralize Invariant Graph Networks (IGNs) to graphons, proposing Invariant\nGraphon Networks (IWNs) defined via a subset of the IGN basis corresponding to\nbounded linear operators.

This\nsignificantly extends the prior work of Cai & Wang (2022), showing that IWNs--a\nsubset of their IGN-small--retain effectively the same expressivity as the full\nIGN basis in the limit. In contrast to their approach, our blueprint of IWNs\nalso aligns better with the geometry of graphon space, for example facilitating\ncomparability to MPNNs.

However, the\ndeformations induced in an extracellular matrix environment in the presence of\na cellular aggregate are more complex, due to the irregularity of the\ntissue-environment interface, the mechanisms of force transmission between the\ntissue and the environment, and the rheology of the tissue itself. Therefore,\nusing a two-dimensional vertex model of a tissue coupled to a surrounding\nspring network model, both of which can undergo rigidity transitions, we\ninvestigate the effects of a cellular aggregate on the rigidity of its\nenvironment. We find that the network's rigidity transition alone is sensitive\nto tissue size, mechanical properties, and surface tension. This sensitivity\ncan, in part, be analytically estimated using a mean-field constraint counting\napproach to arrive at an effective spring network coordination number to\ndetermine how the network rigidity transition location shifts in the presence\nof the tissue spheroid. Moreover, we find that it is energetically favorable to\ncreate a ring of high-tension boundary cells in the tissue spheroid as the\nspring network rigidifies, as opposed to creating a string of high-tension\ncells through the bulk. We also find that increasing interfacial tension of the\ntissue spheroid facilitates rigidity in the spring network. In sum, our\nnumerical and analytical results help reveal the complex mechanical interplay\nbetween a tissue spheroid and its surrounding environment.",

The deployment of\nlarge antenna arrays at high frequencies transitions wireless communication\ninto the radiative near-field, where precise beam alignment becomes essential\nfor accurate channel estimation. Unlike far-field systems, which rely on\nangular domain only, near-field necessitates beam search across both angle and\ndistance dimensions, leading to substantially higher training overhead. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based\nbeam alignment to mitigate the training overhead. We highlight that the reduced\npath loss at shorter distances can compensate for the beamforming losses\ntypically associated with using far-field codebooks in near-field scenarios.\nAdditionally, far-field beamforming in the near-field exhibits angular spread,\nwith its width determined by the user's range and angle. Leveraging this\nrelationship, we develop a correlation interferometry (CI) algorithm, termed\nCI-DFT, to efficiently estimate user angle and range parameters.

This paper questions the validity of both plans,\narguing that they do not take adequate account of the consequences of the\nhighly variable nature of wind and solar generations. Using dynamic models of\nfuture UK electricity systems which are designed to take account of these\nvariabilities, it is shown that the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan overestimates\nthe ability of wind and solar generations to decarbonise the electricity system\nas they increase in size relative to the demand of the electricity system. More\nimportantly, the dynamic models show that most of the achievable\ndecarbonization is the result of increasing wind generation from the current\nlevel of around 10 GW to around 20 GW. Increasing wind generation to only 20\nGW, rather than to 30 GW as proposed in the Action Plan, should halve the\nproposed cost, a saving of perhaps GBP 120 billion, with little disbenefit in\nterms of reduced decarbonization. Furthermore, the dynamic modelling shows that\nUK gas storage capacity of 7.5 winter days looks hopeless inadequate in\ncomparison with the storage capacities deemed necessary by its continental\nneighbors. Concern is expressed that a consequence of the Climate Change Act of\n2008 requiring the UK to meet arbitrary decarbonization targets is leading\ngovernment advisors to propose several unproven and therefore highly risky\ntechnological solutions.",

Existing healthcare data\nsystems are often fragmented and lack a holistic representation of patient\ntrajectories, creating challenges for coordinated care and personalized\ninterventions. Patient Journey Knowledge Graphs (PJKGs) represent a novel\napproach to addressing the challenge of fragmented healthcare data by\nintegrating diverse patient information into a unified, structured\nrepresentation. This paper presents a methodology for constructing PJKGs using\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to process and structure both formal clinical\ndocumentation and unstructured patient-provider conversations.

The research evaluates four different LLMs, such as\nClaude 3.5, Mistral, Llama 3.1, and Chatgpt4o, in their ability to generate\naccurate and computationally efficient knowledge graphs. Results demonstrate\nthat while all models achieved perfect structural compliance, they exhibited\nvariations in medical entity processing and computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging traditionally requires precise\nknowledge of system parameters to implement focusing algorithms that transform\nraw data into high-resolution images. These algorithms require knowledge of SAR\nsystem parameters, such as wavelength, center slant range, fast time sampling\nrate, pulse repetition interval (PRI), waveform parameters (e.g., frequency\nmodulation rate), and platform speed. This paper presents a novel framework for\nrecovering SAR images from raw data without the requirement of any SAR system\nparameters. Firstly, we introduce an approximate matched filtering model that\nleverages the inherent shift-invariance properties of SAR echoes, enabling\nimage formation through an adaptive reference echo estimation. To estimate this\nunknown reference echo, we develop a principal component maximization (PCM)\ntechnique that exploits the low-dimensional structure of the SAR signal. The\nPCM method employs a three-stage procedure: 1) data block segmentation, 2)\nenergy normalization, and 3) principal component energy maximization across\nblocks, effectively handling non-stationary clutter environments. Secondly, we\npresent a range-varying azimuth reference signal estimation method that\ncompensates for the quadratic phase errors. For cases where PRI is unknown, we\npropose a two-step PRI estimation scheme that enables robust reconstruction of\n2-D images from 1-D data streams. Experimental results on various SAR datasets\ndemonstrate that our method can effectively recover SAR images from raw data\nwithout any prior system parameters.",

This perspective\nadopts a box count technique, commonly used to assess the hierarchical and\nscale-related geometry of physical structures, which has been extensively\nformalized under the topic of fractal geometry. We assess the structural\ncomplexity of neural layers by estimating the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension\nof their layers and evaluating a degree of self-similarity.

We discuss\ntwo possible extensions of the infrared-safe scheme defined in Ref. [Phys. Rev.\nD, 84, 045018, 2011] for the Euclidean version of the model, which coincide\nwith the latter in the space-like region upon identifying\n$\\smash{Q^2\\equiv-q^2}$ with the square of the renormalization scale in that\nreference. The first extension uses real-valued renormalization factors and\nleads to a flow in the time-like region with a similar structure as the flow in\nthe space-like region (or in the Euclidean model), including a non-trivial\nfixed point and a family of trajectories bounded at all scales by the value of\nthe coupling at this fixed point. Interestingly, the fixed point in the\ntime-like region has a much smaller value of $\\lambda\\equiv g^2N/16\\pi^2$ than\nthe corresponding one in the space-like region, a value closer to the\nperturbative boundary $\\smash{\\lambda=1}$. However, in this real-valued\ninfrared-safe scheme, the flow cannot connect the time-like and space-like\nregions. Thus, it is not possible to deduce the relevant time-like flow\ntrajectory from the sole knowledge of a space-like flow trajectory.

First, the theory is considered in four dimensional flat\nspace in terms of spin-tensor fields with two component undotted and dotted\nindices. This leads to a significant simplification of the whole approach in\ncomparison with the one where the fields with vector indices were used, since\nnow there is no need to introduce a constraint responsible for the traces of\nthe fields into the BRST charge. Second, we develop an extremely simple and\nclear procedure to eliminate all the auxiliary fields and prove that the BRST\nequations of motion identically reproduce the basic conditions for irreducible\nrepresentations of the Poinc\\'are group with a given mass and spin. Similar to\nthe massless theory, the final Lagrangian for massive higher-spin fields is\nformulated in triplet form. The BRST formulation leads to a system of fields\nthat are clearly subdivided into the basic spin $s$ field, Zinoviev-like\nauxiliary fields, Singh-Hagen-like auxiliary fields, and special BRST auxiliary\nfields. The auxiliary fields can be partially eliminated by gauge fixing and/or\nusing the equations of motion. This allows one to obtain formally different\n(with different numbers of auxiliary fields) but equivalent Lagrangian\nformulations.",

We argue that training a GNIDS model has to consider privacy\nregulations, and propose to leverage federated learning (FL) to address this\nprominent challenge.\n  Yet, directly applying FL to GNIDS is unlikely to succeed, due to issues like\nnon-IID (independent and identically distributed) graph data over clients and\nthe diverse design choices taken by different GNIDS.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel method to synthetically generate realistic\n3D representations of wooden logs. Efficient sawmilling heavily relies on\naccurate measurement of logs and the distribution of knots inside them.\nComputed Tomography (CT) can be used to obtain accurate information about the\nknots but is often not feasible in a sawmill environment. A promising\nalternative is to utilize surface measurements and machine learning techniques\nto predict the inner structure of the logs. However, obtaining enough training\ndata remains a challenge. We focus mainly on two aspects of log generation: the\nmodeling of knot growth inside the tree, and the realistic synthesis of the\nsurface including the regions, where the knots reach the surface. This results\nin the first log synthesis approach capable of generating both the internal\nknot and external surface structures of wood. We demonstrate that the proposed\nmathematical log model accurately fits to real data obtained from CT scans and\nenables the generation of realistic logs.",

However, current diffusion-based methods\nstruggle with fine-grained style customization due to challenges in controlling\nmultiple style attributes, such as color and texture. This paper introduces the\nfirst tuning-free approach to achieve free-lunch color-texture disentanglement\nin stylized T2I generation, addressing the need for independently controlled\nstyle elements for the Disentangled Stylized Image Generation (DisIG) problem.\nOur approach leverages the Image-Prompt Additivity property in the CLIP image\nembedding space to develop techniques for separating and extracting\nColor-Texture Embeddings (CTE) from individual color and texture reference\nimages. To ensure that the color palette of the generated image aligns closely\nwith the color reference, we apply a whitening and coloring transformation to\nenhance color consistency. Additionally, to prevent texture loss due to the\nsignal-leak bias inherent in diffusion training, we introduce a noise term that\npreserves textural fidelity during the Regularized Whitening and Coloring\nTransformation (RegWCT). Through these methods, our Style Attributes\nDisentanglement approach (SADis) delivers a more precise and customizable\nsolution for stylized image generation. Experiments on images from the WikiArt\nand StyleDrop datasets demonstrate that, both qualitatively and quantitatively,\nSADis surpasses state-of-the-art stylization methods in the DisIG task.Code\nwill be released at https://deepffff.github.io/sadis.github.io/.",

Due to its efficient and high-quality novel view synthesis\ncapabilities, it has been widely adopted in many research fields and\napplications. Nevertheless, 3DGS still faces challenges to properly manage the\nnumber of Gaussian primitives that are used during scene reconstruction.\nFollowing the adaptive density control (ADC) mechanism of 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, new Gaussians in under-reconstructed regions are created, while\nGaussians that do not contribute to the rendering quality are pruned. We\nobserve that those criteria for densifying and pruning Gaussians can sometimes\nlead to worse rendering by introducing artifacts. We especially observe\nunder-reconstructed background or overfitted foreground regions. To encounter\nboth problems, we propose three new improvements to the adaptive density\ncontrol mechanism. Those include a correction for the scene extent calculation\nthat does not only rely on camera positions, an exponentially ascending\ngradient threshold to improve training convergence, and significance-aware\npruning strategy to avoid background artifacts. With these adaptions, we show\nthat the rendering quality improves while using the same number of Gaussians\nprimitives. Furthermore, with our improvements, the training converges\nconsiderably faster, allowing for more than twice as fast training times while\nyielding better quality than 3DGS.

When validated against TLS-derived\nground truth from Mediterranean forests, model performance decreased\nsignificantly compared to assessment based on hand-labelled from an\necologically similar site (AP50: 0.094 vs. 0.670). Restricting evaluation to\nonly canopy trees shrank this gap considerably (Canopy AP50: 0.365), although\nperformance was still far lower than on similar hand-labelled data. Models also\nperformed poorly on boreal forest data (AP50: 0.142), although again increasing\nwhen evaluated on canopy trees only (Canopy AP50: 0.308). Both models showed\nvery poor localisation accuracy at stricter IoU thresholds, even when\nrestricted to canopy trees (Max AP75: 0.051).

The\ndifficulty arises when the characteristic polynomial of the recurrence has\nseveral roots of maximal modulus, called dominant roots of the recurrence. We\nstudy the positivity problem for recurrences with polynomial coefficients,\nfocusing on sequences of Poincar\\'e type, which are perturbations of\nconstant-coefficient recurrences. The dominant eigenvalues of a recurrence in\nthis class are the dominant roots of the associated constant-coefficient\nrecurrence. Previously, we have proved the decidability of positivity for\nrecurrences having a unique, simple, dominant eigenvalue, under a genericity\nassumption. The associated algorithm proves positivity by constructing a\npositive cone contracted by the recurrence operator. We extend this cone-based\napproach to a larger class of recurrences, where a contracted cone may no\nlonger exist. The main idea is to construct a sequence of cones. Each cone in\nthis sequence is mapped by the recurrence operator to the next. This\nconstruction can be applied to prove positivity by induction. For recurrences\nwith several simple dominant eigenvalues, we provide a condition that ensures\nthat these successive inclusions hold.

Since server and clients only need to share $\\vec p$, such a\ntrade-off leads to a substantial improvement in communication cost.

Hexagonal boron nitride\n(hBN), the most commonly used dielectric material, has proven indispensable in\nthis field, allowing the encapsulation of active 2D materials preserving their\nexceptional electronic quality. However, not all device applications require\nfull encapsulation but rather require open surfaces, or even selective\npatterning of hBN layers. Here, we report on a procedure to engineer top hBN\nlayers within van der Waals heterostructures while preserving the underlying\nactive 2D layers. Using a soft selective SF6 etching combined with a series of\npre and post-etching treatments, we demonstrate that pristine surfaces can be\nexposed with atomic flatness while preserving the active layers electronic\nquality. We benchmark our technique using graphene encapsulated with hBN Hall\nbar devices. Using Raman spectroscopy combined with quantum transport, we show\nhigh quality can be preserved in etched regions by demonstrating low\ntemperature carrier mobilities of 200,000 cm2Vs-1, ballistic transport probed\nthrough magnetic focusing, and intrinsic room temperature phonon-limited\nmobilities. Atomic force microscopy brooming and O2 plasma cleaning are\nidentified as key pre-etching steps to obtaining pristine open surfaces while\npreserving electronic quality.

To address the\nperson rotation problem, we convert the fisheye images into panoramic images.\nFor smaller people, we focused on the geometry of the panoramas. Conventional\ndetection methods tend to focus on larger people because these larger people\nyield large significant areas for feature maps. In equirectangular panoramic\nimages, we find that a person's height decreases linearly near the top of the\nimages. Using this finding, we leverage the significance values and aggregate\ntokens that are sorted based on these values to balance the significant areas.\nIn this leveraging process, we introduce panoramic distortion-aware\ntokenization. This tokenization procedure divides a panoramic image using\nself-similarity figures that enable determination of optimal divisions without\ngaps, and we leverage the maximum significant values in each tile of token\ngroups to preserve the significant areas of smaller people.

In this work, we reveal a new type of\nphase transition in mixed states, termed \\emph{quantum} strong-to-weak\nspontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory\ncalculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the\nglobal phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under local strong symmetry\npreserving decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger\nliquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the\nboundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying\neffective central charge. Importantly, we analyze this transition from two\ncomplementary perspectives: on one hand, through the behavior of order\nparameters that characterize the symmetry breaking; on the other hand, from a\nquantum information viewpoint by studying entropic quantities and the concept\nof quantum recoverability. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is\n\\emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the\nHamiltonian parameter even under arbitrary decoherence strength, fundamentally\ndistinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively\ndiscussed in previous literature.

This is operationalized through novel genetic\noperators that work with structured natural language prompts, effectively\nutilizing LLMs as conditional generative models and sources of semantic\nknowledge. Specifically, we introduce $\\textit{fitness-guided}$ crossover to\nexploit high-performing regions, and $\\textit{diversity-guided}$ mutation for\nefficient global exploration of the search space. These operators are\ncontrolled by corresponding hyperparameters that enable a more nuanced balance\nbetween exploration and exploitation across the search space.

    "abstract": "Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based Perturb-seq analyses, face a vast\nhypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming.\nGene perturbation models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict\nthe outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Due to the\ncost of genomic experiments, active learning is often employed to train these\nmodels, alternating between wet-lab experiments and model updates. However, the\noperational constraints of the wet-lab and the iterative nature of active\nlearning significantly increase the total training time. Furthermore, the\ninherent sensitivity to model initialization can lead to markedly different\nsets of gene perturbations across runs, which undermines the reproducibility,\ninterpretability, and reusability of the method. To this end, we propose a\ngraph-based data filtering method that, unlike active learning, selects the\ngene perturbations in one shot and in a model-free manner. The method optimizes\na criterion that maximizes the supervision signal from the graph neural network\nto enhance generalization. The criterion is defined over the input graph and is\noptimized with submodular maximization. We compare it empirically to active\nlearning, and the results demonstrate that despite yielding months of\nacceleration, it also improves the stability of the selected perturbation\nexperiments while achieving comparable test error.",

Relationships between variables are not maintained in\nLFSD, but a real or apparent data breach can occur from its release.

However, single deep learning models frequently face\nissues related to extracting key features from complex retinal images. To\nhandle this problem, we present an effective ensemble method for DR diagnosis\ncomprising four main phases: image pre-processing, selection of backbone\npre-trained models, feature enhancement, and optimization. Our methodology\ninitiates with the pre-processing phase, where we apply CLAHE to enhance image\ncontrast and Gamma correction is then used to adjust the brightness for better\nfeature recognition. We then apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for image\nfusion by combining multi-resolution details to create a richer dataset. Then,\nwe selected three pre-trained models with the best performance named\nDenseNet169, MobileNetV1, and Xception for diverse feature extraction. To\nfurther improve feature extraction, an improved residual block is integrated\ninto each model. Finally, the predictions from these base models are then\naggregated using weighted ensemble approach, with the weights optimized by\nusing Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA).SSA intelligently explores the weight space\nand finds the optimal configuration of base architectures to maximize the\nperformance of the ensemble model.

    "abstract": "Muscle contraction, both in skeletal and cardiac tissue, is driven by\nsarcomeres, the microscopic units inside muscle cells where thick myosin and\nthin actin filaments slide past each other. During contraction and relaxation,\nthe sarcomere's volume changes, causing sarcoplasm (intra-sarcomeric fluid) to\nflow out during contraction and back in as the sarcomere relaxes. We present a\nquantitative model of this sarcoplasmic flow, treating the sarcomere as an\nanisotropic porous medium with regions defined by the presence and absence of\nthick and thin filaments. Using semi-analytic methods, we solve for axial and\nlateral fluid flow within the filament lattice, calculating the permeabilities\nof this porous structure. We then apply these permeabilities within a Darcy\nmodel to determine the flow field generated during contraction. The predictions\nof our continuum model show excellent agreement with finite element\nsimulations, reducing computational time by several orders of magnitude while\nmaintaining accuracy in modelling the biophysical flow dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL)-based code completion tools have transformed software\ndevelopment by enabling advanced code generation. These tools leverage models\ntrained on vast amounts of code from numerous repositories, capturing general\ncoding patterns. However, the impact of fine-tuning these models for specific\norganizations or developers to boost their performance on such subjects remains\nunexplored. In this work, we fill this gap by presenting solid empirical\nevidence answering this question. More specifically, we consider 136 developers\nfrom two organizations (Apache and Spring), two model architectures (T5 and\nCode Llama), and three model sizes (60M, 750M, and 7B trainable parameters). T5\nmodels (60M, 750M) were pre-trained and fine-tuned on over 2,000 open-source\nprojects, excluding the subject organizations' data, and compared against\nversions fine-tuned on organization- and developer-specific datasets. For the\nCode Llama model (7B), we compared the performance of the already pre-trained\nmodel publicly available online with the same model fine-tuned via\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning on organization- and developer-specific\ndatasets. Our results show that there is a boost in prediction capabilities\nprovided by both an organization-specific and a developer-specific additional\nfine-tuning, with the former being particularly performant. Such a finding\ngeneralizes across (i) the two subject organizations (i.e., Apache and Spring)\nand (ii) models of completely different magnitude (from 60M to 7B trainable\nparameters). Finally, we show that DL models fine-tuned on an\norganization-specific dataset achieve the same completion performance of\npre-trained code models used out of the box and being $\\sim$10$\\times$ larger,\nwith consequent savings in terms of deployment and inference cost (e.g.,\nsmaller GPUs needed).",

Unlike previous methods that typically\nstruggle with sparse views with few overlappings and are less effective in\nreconstructing complex human geometry, the proposed method enables robust\nreconstruction in such challenging conditions. Our key idea is to lift SMPL\nvertices to dense and reliable 3D prior points representing accurate human body\ngeometry, and then regress human Gaussian parameters based on the points. To\naccount for possible misalignment between SMPL model and images, we propose to\npredict image-aligned 3D prior points by leveraging both pixel-level features\nand voxel-level features, from which we regress the coarse Gaussians. To\nenhance the ability to capture high-frequency details, we further render depth\nmaps from the coarse 3D Gaussians to help regress fine-grained pixel-wise\nGaussians. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis and\ncross-dataset generalization.

Instead, dark matter (DM)-only simulations are\nused, with galaxies populated a posteriori, typically via halo occupation\ndistribution (HOD) models. While effective, HOD models are statistical in\nnature and lack full physical motivation.\n  In this work, we explore using neural networks (NNs) to learn the complex,\nphysically motivated relationships between DM haloes and galaxy properties.\nTrained on small-volume, high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, our NN\npredicts galaxy properties in a larger DM-only simulation and determines which\ngalaxies should be classified as luminous red galaxies (LRGs).\n  Comparing the original LRG sample to the one generated by our NN, we find\nthat, while the subhalo mass distributions are similar, our NN selects fewer\nlow-mass subhaloes as LRG hosts, possibly due to the absence of baryonic\nfeedback effects in DM-only simulations. This feedback could brighten or redden\ngalaxies, altering their classification.\n  Finally, we generate a new LRG sample by fitting an HOD model to the\nNN-generated LRG sample. We verify that both the HOD- and NN-generated samples\npreserve a set of bias parameter relations, which assume that the higher-order\nparameters, $b_{s2}$ and $b_{3\\rm{nl}}$, are determined by the linear bias\nparameter $b_{1}$.

Besides, the fixed\ntime-step length limits the utilization of the available UAV dynamics in the\ntarget neighborhood.

The MGs are based on\npoly($N$-isopropylacrylamide) networks. For studying the structure at the\nair/water interface specular and off-specular X-ray reflectivity (OSR/XRR)\nallows in situ measurements without any labelling techniques. The initial ex\nsitu atomic force microscopy (AFM) scans of LB-transferred MGs at the air/solid\ninterface reveal strong lateral 2D hexagonal ordering across a broad range of\nlateral surface pressures at the air/water interface before LB-transfer.\nNotably, for the first time, these results were confirmed by OSR, demonstrating\nthe existence of the long-range hexagonal ordering at low and intermediate\nsurface pressures. For in situ conditions and upon uniaxial compression at the\nair/water interface, the MG lattice constant decreases non-monotonically. This\nindicates the formation of domains at low pressures, that approach each other\nand only compress when the surface isotherm reaches a plateau. Comparing\nresults of in situ and ex situ measurements, our study clearly shows a transfer\neffect during the LB-deposition on the lateral ordering of the MGs: The\ndistance between the particles decrease during LB-transfer and at high\npressures ($\\Pi\\,>\\,22\\,\\mathrm{mNm^{-1}}$) a second distance occurs indicating\nsmall domains with hexagonal internal ordering. The novel surface\ncharacterisation approaches here highlight the use of both XRR and OSR to probe\nthe vertical and lateral structure of adsorbed MGs, offering in situ,\nnon-invasive insights without the need for doping or transfer-induced\nartefacts.",

    "abstract": "Stars in galactic centers are occasionally scattered so close to the central\nsupermassive black hole that they are completely disrupted by tidal forces,\ninitiating a transient accretion event. The aftermath of such a tidal\ndisruption event (TDE) produces a bright-and-blue accretion flow which is known\nto persist for at least a decade (observationally) and can in principle produce\nionizing radiation for hundreds of years. Tidal disruption events are known\n(observationally) to be overrepresented in galaxies which show extended\nemission line regions (EELRs), with no pre-TDE classical AGN activity, and to\nproduce transient ``coronal lines'', such as [FeX] and [FeXIV]. Using coupled\nCLOUDY-TDE disk simulations we show that tidal disruption event disks produce a\nsufficient ionizing radiation flux over their lifetimes to power both EELR of\nradial extents of $r \\sim 10^4$ light years, and coronal lines. EELRs are\nproduced when the ionizing radiation interacts with low density $n_H \\sim 10^1\n- 10^3 \\, {\\rm cm}^{-3}$ clouds on galactic scales, while coronal lines are\nproduced by high density $n_H \\sim 10^6 - 10^8 \\, {\\rm cm}^{-3}$ clouds near\nthe galactic center. High density gas in galactic centers will also result in\nthe rapid switching on of narrow line features in post-TDE galaxies, and also\nvarious high-ionization lines which may be observed throughout the infrared\nwith JWST. Galaxies with a higher intrinsic rate of tidal disruption events\nwill be more likely to show macroscopic EELRs, which can be traced to originate\nfrom the previous tidal disruption event in that galaxy, which naturally\nexplains why TDEs are more likely to be discovered in galaxies with EELRs. We\nfurther argue that a non-negligible fraction of so-called optically selected\n``AGN'' are tidal disruption events.",

The\nshadow forms instantaneously at the moment the black hole appears when ignoring\nthe time delay of light propagation. Considering the time delay for light\npropagation in dynamical spacetime, a more intricate process of the shadow\nformation is uncovered: it first appears as a minute dot in the lensing center,\nthen gradually grows as the black hole grows, eventually expands the inner\nregion of the light-ring. During the quasi-stable phases of boson star and\nblack hole, the lensing and shadow structures from two scenarios are nearly\nidentical and remain almost unchanged.

This theory\nexamines the behavior of this family of random variables, and also of its\nnormalized version, as $t \\uparrow R$.\n  This thesis aims to harmonize the various asymptotic formulas for\ncombinatorial or probabilistic objects within a single framework. With this aim\nwe have extended some of the classes of functions and also studied the\ncoefficients of large powers of analytic functions. One of our main goals was\nto consolidate and develop some aspects of a comprehensive theory: providing a\nguidebook for combinatorialists or probabilists, a series of results, or basic\ncriteria, where they can follow a step-by-step process, verify if certain\nstraightforward conditions are met, and then derive an asymptotic formula for\nthe object of study. However, this is not the sole primary goal; we are also\nprofoundly interested in the functional theoretical properties of these classes\nof functions and their connections to the respective Khinchin families (such as\nthe case of $f \\in \\mathcal{K}$ being an entire function).",

Current standard practices in PCC highlight a primary\nissue: while single-feature metrics are widely used to assess compression\ndistortion, the classic method of searching point-to-point nearest neighbors\nfrequently fails to adequately build precise correspondences between point\nclouds, resulting in an ineffective capture of human perceptual features. To\novercome the related limitations, we propose a novel assessment method called\nRBFIM, utilizing radial basis function (RBF) interpolation to convert discrete\npoint features into a continuous feature function for the distorted point\ncloud. By substituting the geometry coordinates of the original point cloud\ninto the feature function, we obtain the bijective sets of point features. This\nenables an establishment of precise corresponding features between distorted\nand original point clouds and significantly improves the accuracy of quality\nassessments.

This study aims to thoroughly compare the performance, efficiency, and\nexplainability of four prevalent deep learning architectures: Autoencoder,\nResNet, UNet, and Transformer-based Swin-UNet. Employing a real-world dataset\nthat includes nearly a decade of remote sensing data from California, U.S.,\nthese models predict the spread of wildfires for the following day. Through\ndetailed quantitative comparison analysis, we discovered that Transformer-based\nSwin-UNet and UNet generally outperform Autoencoder and ResNet, particularly\ndue to the advanced attention mechanisms in Transformer-based Swin-UNet and the\nefficient use of skip connections in both UNet and Transformer-based Swin-UNet,\nwhich contribute to superior predictive accuracy and model interpretability.\nThen we applied XAI techniques on all four models, this not only enhances the\nclarity and trustworthiness of models but also promotes focused improvements in\nwildfire prediction capabilities.

In this work, the authors demonstrate alternating\nshot-to-shot detection of TA measurements with different pump polarization,\nminimizing systematic errors due to laser fluctuations. The employed broadband\ndetection lets us discuss effects dependent on detection wavelength in the\nultrafast anisotropy decay of 2,3-Naphthalocyanin, a system previously\nscrutinized by David Jonas and co-workers. In particular we compare timescales\nof population relaxation and decoherence and supported the proposals for\nisotropic type of relaxation in square symmetric molecules.",

    "abstract": "Deep networks for electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding are often only trained\nto solve one specific task, such as pathology or age decoding. A more general\ntask-agnostic approach is to train deep networks to match a (clinical) EEG\nrecording to its corresponding textual medical report and vice versa. This\napproach was pioneered in the computer vision domain matching images and their\ntext captions and subsequently allowed to do successful zero-shot decoding\nusing textual class prompts. In this work, we follow this approach and develop\na contrastive learning framework, EEG-CLIP, that aligns the EEG time series and\nthe descriptions of the corresponding clinical text in a shared embedding\nspace. We investigated its potential for versatile EEG decoding, evaluating\nperformance in a range of few-shot and zero-shot settings. Overall, we show\nthat EEG-CLIP manages to non-trivially align text and EEG representations. Our\nwork presents a promising approach to learn general EEG representations, which\ncould enable easier analyses of diverse decoding questions through zero-shot\ndecoding or training task-specific models from fewer training examples.

In this study, we introduce a novel\nvisual-language alignment method that casts the key issue as a Visual Question\nAnswering with Mask generation (VQAMask) task, optimizing two tasks\nsimultaneously: VQA-based text parsing and mask generation. The former allows\nthe model to implicitly align images and text at the semantic level. The latter\nintroduces an additional mask generator (discarded during inference) to\nexplicitly ensure alignment between visual texts within images and their\ncorresponding image regions at a spatially-aware level. Together, they can\nprevent model hallucinations when parsing visual text and effectively promote\nspatially-aware feature representation learning. To support the proposed\nVQAMask task, we construct a comprehensive image-mask generation pipeline and\nprovide a large-scale dataset with 6M data (MTMask6M). Subsequently, we\ndemonstrate that introducing the proposed mask generation task yields\ncompetitive document-level understanding performance. Leveraging the proposed\nVQAMask, we introduce Marten, a training-efficient MLLM tailored for\ndocument-level understanding.

The performance of these models is determined by a complex\ninterdependence among the model architecture, optimization/loss function and\ndatasets. Although FRSs have surpassed human-level accuracy, they continue to\nbe disparate against certain demographics. Due to the ubiquity of applications,\nit is extremely important to understand the impact of the three components --\nmodel architecture, loss function and face image dataset on the\naccuracy-disparity trade-off to design better, unbiased platforms. In this\nwork, we perform an in-depth analysis of three FRSs for the task of gender\nprediction, with various architectural modifications resulting in ten\ndeep-learning models coupled with four loss functions and benchmark them on\nseven face datasets across 266 evaluation configurations. Our results show that\nall three components have an individual as well as a combined impact on both\naccuracy and disparity. We identify that datasets have an inherent property\nthat causes them to perform similarly across models, independent of the choice\nof loss functions. Moreover, the choice of dataset determines the model's\nperceived bias -- the same model reports bias in opposite directions for three\ngender-balanced datasets of ``in-the-wild'' face images of popular individuals.\nStudying the facial embeddings shows that the models are unable to generalize a\nuniform definition of what constitutes a ``female face'' as opposed to a ``male\nface'', due to dataset diversity.

Using two early-stage Capella SysML models of space\nmissions with associated requirements, we apply the intervened LLMs to reason\nover a graph representation of the model to determine whether a requirement is\nfulfilled. Our method achieves robust and reliable outputs, significantly\nimproving over both a baseline model and a fine-tuning approach. By identifying\nand modifying as few as one to three specialised attention heads, we can\nsignificantly change the model's behavior. When combined with self-consistency,\nthis allows us to achieve perfect precision on our holdout test set.",

We introduce SpecReX, specifically adapted to explaining\nRaman spectra. SpecReX uses the theory of actual causality to rank causal\nresponsibility in a spectrum, quantified by iteratively refining mutated\nversions of the spectrum and testing if it retains the original classification.\nThe explanations provided by SpecReX take the form of a responsibility map,\nhighlighting spectral regions most responsible for the model to make a correct\nclassification. To assess the validity of SpecReX, we create increasingly\ncomplex simulated spectra, in which a \"ground truth\" signal is seeded, to train\na classifier. We then obtain SpecReX explanations and compare the results with\nanother explainability tool. By using simulated spectra we establish that\nSpecReX localizes to the known differences between classes, under a number of\nconditions. This provides a foundation on which we can find the spectral\nfeatures which differentiate disease classes. This is an important first step\nin proving the validity of SpecReX.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the downlink (DL) physical layer security (PLS) in a\nnear-field (NF) extra-large multiple-input multiple-output MIMO (XL-MIMO)\nsystem. To enhance the secrecy rate (SR), null-space artificial noise (AN) is\ntransmitted alongside the confidential message, ensuring orthogonality with\nlegitimate user equipment (LUE) channels. The objective is to maximize the\nminimum SR by optimizing the NF beamfocusing matrix and power allocation\nbetween the signal and AN, considering various channel state information (CSI)\nconditions and transmit power constraints. The proposed approach uses\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) for beamfocusing optimization and golden\nsection search (GSS) for power allocation. The following open questions are\naddressed: (i) Can AN transmission further enhance SR for multiple LUEs in the\npresence of multiple eavesdropping user equipment (EUEs)? (ii) Can null-space\nAN transmission achieve attractive SR performance even without CSI availability\nfor EUEs? Both questions are affirmatively answered and explored in detail,\nwith an algorithm presented for joint beamfocusing design and AN-aided power\nallocation. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches that\neither omit AN transmission or rely on maximal-ratio transmission (MRT) for\nbeamfocusing.",

We propose to leverage\nconventional image analysis techniques and metrics, as a novel and simple\napproach to estimate tissue SoS. We study eleven metrics in three categories\nfor assessing image quality, image similarity and multi-frame variation, by\ntesting them in numerical simulations and phantom experiments. Among\nsingle-frame image quality metrics, conventional Focus and our proposed\nSmoothed Threshold Tenengrad metrics achieved satisfactory accuracy, however\nonly when applied to compounded images. Image quality metrics were largely\nsurpassed by various image comparison metrics, which exhibited errors\nconsistently under 8 m/s even applied to a single pair of images. Particularly,\nMean Square Error is a computationally efficient alternative for global\nestimation. Mutual Information and Correlation are found to be robust to\nprocessing small image segments, making them suitable, e.g., for multi-layer\nSoS estimation. The above metrics do not require access to raw channel data as\nthey can operate on post-beamformed data, and in the case of image quality\nmetrics they can operate on B-mode images, given that the beamforming SoS can\nbe controlled for beamforming using a multitude of values.

The\nsearch space of a variability-intensive system is usually too large to explore\nwithout statistical inference (e.g. testing). Testing every valid configuration\nis computationally expensive (if not impossible) for most systems. This leads\nmost testing approaches to sample a few configurations before analyzing them. A\ndesirable property of such samples is uniformity: Each solution should have the\nsame selection probability. Uniformity is the property that facilitates\nstatistical inference. This property motivated the design of uniform random\nsamplers, relying on SAT solvers and counters and achieving different\ntrade-offs between uniformity and scalability. Though we can observe their\nperformance in practice, judging the quality of the generated samples is\ndifferent. Assessing the uniformity of a sampler is similar in nature to\nassessing the uniformity of a pseudo-random number (PRNG) generator. However,\nsampling is much slower and the nature of sampling also implies that the\nhyperspace containing the samples is constrained. This means that testing PRNGs\nis subject to fewer constraints than testing samplers. We propose a framework\nthat contains five statistical tests which are suited to test uniform random\nsamplers. Moreover, we demonstrate their use by testing seven samplers.\nFinally, we demonstrate the influence of the Boolean formula given as input to\nthe samplers under test on the test results.",

Our\nresults demonstrate that Urbach tails have only a minimal effect on the\nabsorptance edge broadening and clarify that even an ideal direct semiconductor\nwith no band gap fluctuations shows broadening at the absorptance onset.\nFurthermore, state of the art inorganic thin film solar cells often incorporate\na band gap gradient across their thickness, which can further contribute to\nabsorptance broadening.

In addition, existing\nmethods usually fail to generate limb details well because they are limited by\nthe used clothing-agnostic person representation without referring to the limb\ntextures of the person image. To address these problems, we propose Limb-aware\nVirtual Try-on Network named PL-VTON, which performs fine-grained clothing\nwarping progressively and generates high-quality try-on results with realistic\nlimb details. Specifically, we present Progressive Clothing Warping (PCW) that\nexplicitly models the location and size of in-shop clothing and utilizes a\ntwo-stage alignment strategy to progressively align the in-shop clothing with\nthe human body. Moreover, a novel gravity-aware loss that considers the fit of\nthe person wearing clothing is adopted to better handle the clothing edges.\nThen, we design Person Parsing Estimator (PPE) with a non-limb target parsing\nmap to semantically divide the person into various regions, which provides\nstructural constraints on the human body and therefore alleviates texture\nbleeding between clothing and body regions. Finally, we introduce Limb-aware\nTexture Fusion (LTF) that focuses on generating realistic details in limb\nregions, where a coarse try-on result is first generated by fusing the warped\nclothing image with the person image, then limb textures are further fused with\nthe coarse result under limb-aware guidance to refine limb details.

    "abstract": "Dynamic wetting poses a well-known challenge in classical sharp interface\nformulation as the no-slip wall condition leads to a contact line singularity\nthat is typically regularized with a Navier boundary condition, often requiring\nempirical fitting for the slip length. On the other hand, this paradox does not\nappear in phase-field models as the contact line moves through diffusive mass\ntransport. In this work, we present a toy model that accounts for mass\ndiffusion at the contact line within a sharp interface framework. This model is\nbased on a theoretical relation derived from the Cahn-Hilliard equations, which\nlinks the total diffusive mass transport to the curvature at the wall. From an\nestimate of the chemical potential on a curved interface, we obtain an\nexpression for the width of the highly curved region $\\delta$ and the apparent\nangle. In the sharp interface model, we then introduce a fictitious boundary,\ndisplaced by a distance $\\delta$ into the domain, where a Navier boundary\ncondition is applied along a dynamic apparent contact angle that accounts for\nthe local interface bending. The robustness of the model is assessed by\ncomparing the toy model results with standard phase field ones on two cases:\nthe steady state profiles of a liquid bridge between two plates moving in\nopposite directions and the transient behaviors of a drop spreading on a solid\nwith a prescribed equilibrium angle. This offers a practical and efficient\nalternative to solve contact line problems at lower cost in a sharp interface\nframework with input parameters from phase field models.",

The Poisson Arrival Process models traffic arrival events\nat random intervals. It assumes that events happen independently of one\nanother. This model is ideal for simulating traffic in networks where arrivals\nhappen independently and randomly, such as the start of phone calls, data\nrequests, or packet transmissions. The Poisson Arrival Process and uniformly\nchoosing source and destination pair is been used most commonly by researchers\nto generate traffic in a network to test various promising routing and spectrum\nassignment algorithms.

While Amplitude encoding can turn traits\nnormalized into quantum amplitudes, encoding an angle by using Ry gates to\nencode feature values into rotation angles, and phase encoding by using Rz\ngates to encode extra feature information as phase is plausible to combine all\ntogether. By combining these three methods, this paper demonstrates that\nefficient qubit usage is ensured as Amplitude encoding reduces the required\nqubits, Angle encoding makes state freedom better and is used for expressive\nencoding, and Phase-based distinction.

    "abstract": "Theoretical simulation to phase change materials such as Ge-Sb-Te has\nsuffered from two methodology issues. On the one hand, there is a lack of\nefficient band gap correction method for density functional theory, which is\nsuitable for these materials in both crystalline and amorphous phases, though\nthe computational complexity should be kept at the local density approximation\nlevel. On the other hand, analysis of the coordination number in amorphous\nphases relies on an integration involving the radial distribution function,\nwhich adds to the complexity. In this work, we find that the shell DFT-1/2\nmethod offers an overall band gap accuracy for phase change materials\ncomparable to HSE06 hybrid functional, though its computational cost is around\nthree orders of magnitude lower. Moreover, the mixed length-angle coordination\nnumber theory enables calculating the coordination numbers in the amorphous\nphase directly from the structure, with definite outcomes. The two\nmethodologies could be helpful for high throughput simulation of phase change\nmaterials.",

Although it benefits from current\nretrieval-augmented generation~(RAG) technologies, it still faces two\nsignificant challenges: the collection of dispersed evidence and the efficient\norganization of this evidence to support the complex queries necessary for EBM.\nTo tackle these issues, we propose using LLMs to gather scattered evidence from\nmultiple sources and present a knowledge hypergraph-based evidence management\nmodel to integrate these evidence while capturing intricate relationships.\nFurthermore, to better support complex queries, we have developed an\nImportance-Driven Evidence Prioritization (IDEP) algorithm that utilizes the\nLLM to generate multiple evidence features, each with an associated importance\nscore, which are then used to rank the evidence and produce the final retrieval\nresults. Experimental results from six datasets demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms existing RAG techniques in application domains of interest to EBM,\nsuch as medical quizzing, hallucination detection, and decision support.\nTestsets and the constructed knowledge graph can be accessed at\n\\href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WJ9QTokK3MdkjEmwuFQxwH96j_Byawj_/view?usp=drive_link}{https://drive.google.com/rag4ebm}.",

    "abstract": "Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is\nincreasing scientific attention in establishing the connections between\ntheoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing\nmostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve\nimportant theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has\nformulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which\ngravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between\ntwo metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated\nthat the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient\nflow of the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this\nalgorithm is the outcome of the minimization of the GQRE between two Euclidean\nmetrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image.\nAs the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies\nthat the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration\nof the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic\nactions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the minimization\nof the GQRE is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These\nresults provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the\nPerona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections\nbetween GfE, machine learning and brain research.",

Current ``gray-box'' approaches\ntypically analyze only the probability of the actual tokens in the sequence\nwith simple task-specific heuristics.

    "abstract": "This work focuses on full-body co-speech gesture generation. Existing methods\ntypically employ an autoregressive model accompanied by vector-quantized tokens\nfor gesture generation, which results in information loss and compromises the\nrealism of the generated gestures. To address this, inspired by the natural\ncontinuity of real-world human motion, we propose MAG, a novel multi-modal\naligned framework for high-quality and diverse co-speech gesture synthesis\nwithout relying on discrete tokenization. Specifically, (1) we introduce a\nmotion-text-audio-aligned variational autoencoder (MTA-VAE), which leverages\npre-trained WavCaps' text and audio embeddings to enhance both semantic and\nrhythmic alignment with motion, ultimately producing more realistic gestures.\n(2) Building on this, we propose a multimodal masked autoregressive model\n(MMAG) that enables autoregressive modeling in continuous motion embeddings\nthrough diffusion without vector quantization. To further ensure multi-modal\nconsistency, MMAG incorporates a hybrid granularity audio-text fusion block,\nwhich serves as conditioning for diffusion process. Extensive experiments on\ntwo benchmark datasets demonstrate that MAG achieves stateof-the-art\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively, producing highly realistic\nand diverse co-speech gestures.The code will be released to facilitate future\nresearch.",

The\nobservations were obtained in a round-the-clock daily survey conducted on the\nLarge Phased Array (LPA) radio telescope. The high variability of emission is\nshown not only from pulse to pulse, but also at scales greater than 3 min. The\naverage value of the estimated amplitude of these variations in 3.2 minutes is\n25~Jy, the modulation index is 1. The average relative amplitude of the\ninterpulse (IP) is $2.00 \\pm 0.28\\%$ of the main pulse. In individual pulses,\nthe amplitude of the interpulse may exceed the amplitude of the main pulse\n(MP), but this is a rare event. Emission is observed in almost the entire\nperiod of the pulsar. For the first time, the relative amplitude of emission\nbetween the main pulse and the interpulse (emission bridge) was measured. When\naveraging about 10 hours, it varies from $0.8\\%$ to $1.31\\%$ with an average\nvalue of $1.04 \\pm 0.28\\%$.\n  A high correlation was found between MP and IP amplitude variations both when\naveraging profiles over 3.2 minutes and when averaging over years. This\ncorrelation is due to refractive interstellar scintillation. The frequency\nscale of IP diffraction interstellar scintillation was measured for the first\ntime and it was shown that the spectral forms for IP and MP are well correlated\nand have the same frequency scale. There are strong variations in the frequency\nscale of scintillation $f_{dif}$ from session to session (time interval from\none day) on scales of 200-800 kHz. The refractive scale of scintillation for\n1-2 days has been determined. A modulation of emission with a characteristic\nscale of about 130 days was detected, which, apparently, is also associated\nwith refractive scintillation.",

We classify all spaxels\ninto two subsets: star-forming (SF) regions and non-SF regions. We explore the\ncorrelations of optical opacity ($A_V$) and the optical and NUV slopes of\nattenuation curves ($A_B/A_V$ and $A_{w2}/A_{w1}$) with a broad range of\nstellar and emission-line properties, including specific surface brightness of\nH$\\alpha$ emission, stellar age, stellar and gas-phase metallicity, and\ndiagnostics of recent star formation history. When comparing SF and non-SF\nregions, we find that $A_V$ and $A_B/A_V$ exhibit similar correlations with all\nthe stellar population and emission-line properties considered, while the NUV\nslopes in SF regions tend to be flatter than those in non-SF regions. The NUV\nslope $A_{w2}/A_{w1}$ exhibits an anti-correlation with specific surface\nbrightness of H$\\alpha$ emission, a trend that is primarily driven by the\npositive correlation between $A_{w2}/A_{w1}$ and $\\Sigma_\\ast$. The NUV slope\nflattens in SF regions that contain young stellar populations and have\nexperienced recent star formation, but it shows no obvious dependence on\nstellar or gas-phase metallicity. The spatially resolved dust attenuation\nproperties exhibit no clear correlations with the inclination of host galaxies\nor the galactocentric distance of the regions.

    "abstract": "Light sterile neutrinos, $\\nu_s$, are often introduced to explain an\nanomalous deficit in the electron antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors. If\nthey exist, sterile neutrinos would also be produced in collapsing massive\nstars through the active-sterile neutrino oscillation. In order to investigate\nthe impacts of sterile neutrinos on supernova dynamics, we perform\ntwo-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations of stellar\ncore-collapse coupled with the active-sterile oscillation through the\nMikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect. As the initial condition of our\nsimulations, we adopt a blue supergiant model that is tuned to reproduce\nobservational features of the SN 1987A progenitor to compare our models with\nobservations of the event. It is found that the active-sterile oscillation\nreduces the $\\nu_{e}$ and $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ fluxes and decreases the explosion\nenergy. We also find that, if the mixing angle $\\theta$ and the mass difference\n$\\delta m_\\mathrm{s}^2$ between $\\nu_e$ and $\\nu_s$ are large enough, the star\nfails to explode. This suggests that these mixing parameters relevant to\nsterile neutrinos could be constrained by supernova explodability, though other\nuncertainties in supernova theory need to be addressed to refine them. In\naddition, we predict neutrino signals from a nearby supernova event and find\nthat the neutrino event number can significantly decrease because the $\\nu_e$\nand $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ fluxes are reduced. In particular, DUNE observations of\n$\\nu_e$ will be useful to search for a signature of sterile neutrinos with a\ntiny mixing angle because a smaller mixing angle leads to a larger effect on\nthe $\\nu_e$ flux.",

For efficient operation of the AER system, the optical\ntransition in the two-level system must have a large oscillator strength.\nHowever, this implies a rapid decay of the excited state, which highly\nconstrains the duration of the event that can be recognized, even when the\nimages are retrieved rapidly from a fast parallel optical memory device. This\nconstraint can be overcome by using a three-level Lambda system to transfer\noptical coherence to long-lived electro-nuclear spin coherence and vice-versa.\nHere, we present an analysis of the AER process employing such a Lambda system.\nWe also show that due to the longitudinal and transverse variation of the\nphases of the optical fields undergoing Fresnel diffraction, the density matrix\nequations must account for the differences in the phases of the coherence\nexcited in each pixel and the corresponding phases of the optical fields in\nsubsequent pulses.",

However, the challenge of\nselecting informative features to ensure both performance and efficiency\nremains a significant question in MVML. Existing methods often extract\ninformation separately from the consistency part and the complementary part,\nwhich may result in noise due to unclear segmentation. In this paper, we\npropose a unified model constructed from the perspective of global-view\nreconstruction. Additionally, while feature selection methods can discern the\nimportance of features, they typically overlook the uncertainty of samples,\nwhich is prevalent in realistic scenarios. To address this, we incorporate the\nperception of sample uncertainty during the reconstruction process to enhance\ntrustworthiness. Thus, the global-view is reconstructed through the graph\nstructure between samples, sample confidence, and the view relationship. The\naccurate mapping is established between the reconstructed view and the label\nmatrix. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method\non multi-view datasets.",

The first four tutorials cover the basics of running\nmolecular simulations in LAMMPS with systems of varying complexities.

    "abstract": "Remote sensing object detection (RSOD) often suffers from degradations such\nas low spatial resolution, sensor noise, motion blur, and adverse illumination.\nThese factors diminish feature distinctiveness, leading to ambiguous object\nrepresentations and inadequate foreground-background separation. Existing RSOD\nmethods exhibit limitations in robust detection of low-quality objects. To\naddress these pressing challenges, we introduce LEGNet, a lightweight backbone\nnetwork featuring a novel Edge-Gaussian Aggregation (EGA) module specifically\nengineered to enhance feature representation derived from low-quality remote\nsensing images. EGA module integrates: (a) orientation-aware Scharr filters to\nsharpen crucial edge details often lost in low-contrast or blurred objects, and\n(b) Gaussian-prior-based feature refinement to suppress noise and regularize\nambiguous feature responses, enhancing foreground saliency under challenging\nconditions. EGA module alleviates prevalent problems in reduced contrast,\nstructural discontinuities, and ambiguous feature responses prevalent in\ndegraded images, effectively improving model robustness while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across five benchmarks\n(DOTA-v1.0, v1.5, DIOR-R, FAIR1M-v1.0, and VisDrone2019) demonstrate that\nLEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in detecting\nlow-quality objects.

    "abstract": "The process of developing antenna structures typically involves prototype\nmeasurements. While accurate validation of far-field performance can be\nperformed in dedicated facilities like anechoic chambers, high cost of\nconstruction and maintenance might not justify their use for teaching, or\nlow-budget research scenarios. Non-anechoic experiments provide a\ncost-effective alternative, however the performance metrics obtained in such\nconditions require appropriate correction. In this paper, we consider a\nmultitaper approach for post-processing antenna far-field characteristics\nmeasured in challenging, non-anechoic environments. The discussed algorithm\nenhances one-shot measurements to enable extraction of line-of-sight responses\nwhile attenuating interferences from multi-path propagation and the noise from\nexternal sources of electromagnetic radiation. The performance of the\nconsidered method has been demonstrated in uncontrolled conditions using a\ncompact spline-based monopole. Furthermore, the approach has been favorably\nvalidated against the state-of-the-art techniques from the literature.",

A systematic comparison of the current calculation with previous\npn-QRPA and independent particle model (IPM) results is presented for the first\ntime. The reported EC rates are nearly the same when compared with the previous\npn-QRPA calculation. On the other hand, the reported BD rates are generally\nsmaller by up to an order of magnitude. Comparison with IPM results shows that\nour calculated rates are larger by two orders of magnitude.

    "abstract": "Cholera, an acute diarrheal disease, is a serious concern in developing and\nunderdeveloped areas. A qualitative understanding of cholera epidemics aims to\nforesee transmission patterns based on reported data and mechanistic models.\nThe mechanistic model is a crucial tool for capturing the dynamics of disease\ntransmission and population spread. However, using real-time cholera cases is\nessential for forecasting the transmission trend. This prospective study seeks\nto furnish insights into transmission trends through qualitative dynamics\nfollowed by machine learning-based forecasting. The Monte Carlo Markov Chain\napproach is employed to calibrate the proposed mechanistic model. We identify\ncritical parameters that illustrate the disease's dynamics using partial rank\ncorrelation coefficient-based sensitivity analysis. The basic reproduction\nnumber as a crucial threshold measures asymptotic dynamics. Furthermore,\nforward bifurcation directs the stability of the infection state, and Hopf\nbifurcation suggests that trends in transmission may become unpredictable as\nsocietal disinfection rates rise. Further, we develop epidemic-informed machine\nlearning models by incorporating mechanistic cholera dynamics into\nautoregressive integrated moving averages and autoregressive neural networks.\nWe forecast short-term future cholera cases in Malawi by implementing the\nproposed epidemic-informed machine learning models to support this. We assert\nthat integrating temporal dynamics into the machine learning models can enhance\nthe capabilities of cholera forecasting models. The execution of this mechanism\ncan significantly influence future trends in cholera transmission. This\nevolving approach can also be beneficial for policymakers to interpret and\nrespond to potential disease systems. Moreover, our methodology is replicable\nand adaptable, encouraging future research on disease dynamics.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the safety-critical control problem for uncertain systems\nunder multiple control barrier function (CBF) constraints and input constraints\nis investigated. A novel framework is proposed to generate a safety filter that\nminimizes changes to reference inputs when safety risks arise, ensuring a\nbalance between safety and performance. A nonlinear disturbance observer (DOB)\nbased on the robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) is used to\nestimate system uncertainties, ensuring that the estimation error converges to\nzero exponentially. This error bound is integrated into the safety-critical\ncontroller to reduce conservativeness while ensuring safety. To further address\nthe challenges arising from multiple CBF and input constraints, a novel Volume\nCBF (VCBF) is proposed by analyzing the feasible space of the quadratic\nprogramming (QP) problem. % ensuring solution feasibility by keeping the volume\nas a positive value. To ensure that the feasible space does not vanish under\ndisturbances, a DOB-VCBF-based method is introduced, ensuring system safety\nwhile maintaining the feasibility of the resulting QP. Subsequently, several\ngroups of simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed controller.",

We identify several benefits of KT\nfor both evaluation and training: an essentially infinite number of problem\ninstances of varying difficulty is readily available, strong baselines already\nexist, the evaluation metric (compression) cannot be gamed, and pretraining\ndata contamination is highly unlikely. To evaluate current models, we use\naudio, text, and DNA data, as well as sequences produced by random synthetic\nprograms.

While automated\nmethods have advanced in recent years, state-of-the-art approaches tend to\nincreasingly complex model designs. In this paper, we propose a conceptually\nsimple yet effective decoupled learning scheme for automated cell counting,\nconsisting of separate counter and localizer networks. In contrast to jointly\nlearning counting and density map estimation, we show that decoupling these\nobjectives surprisingly improves results. The counter operates on intermediate\nfeature maps rather than pixel space to leverage global context and produce\ncount estimates, while also generating coarse density maps. The localizer then\nreconstructs high-resolution density maps that precisely localize individual\ncells, conditional on the original images and coarse density maps from the\ncounter. Besides, to boost counting accuracy, we further introduce a global\nmessage passing module to integrate cross-region patterns. Extensive\nexperiments on four datasets demonstrate that our approach, despite its\nsimplicity, challenges common practice and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance by significant margins. Our key insight is that decoupled learning\nalleviates the need to learn counting on high-resolution density maps directly,\nallowing the model to focus on global features critical for accurate estimates.\nCode is available at https://github.com/MedAITech/DCL.",

This work explores the potential of\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning of compact open-weight language models to\nhandle reasoning-intensive tasks in the underrepresented Ukrainian language,\nbuilding on the findings of the ZNO-Eval benchmark. Parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning of LLaMA 3.1 (8 billion parameters), LLaMA 3.2 (3 billion\nparameters), and Gemma 2 (9 billion parameters) models on chain-of-thought\nsolutions resulted in a modest test score improvement of up to 17.4% on complex\nmatching tasks and 1.6% overall compared to tuning on answer letters alone,\noffering enhanced interpretability and robustness.

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in\neither temporal or spatial localization. However, they struggle to perform\nspatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major\nchallenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal\ninformation of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of\nvisual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame\nto their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we\nintroduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding\ncapability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware\nQueries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information.\nMoreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding\nconnection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to\nthe lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal\nGrounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This\ndataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate\nlocalization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11\nbenchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding\ntasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and\nmodel will be released at https://github.com/Jayce1kk/SpaceVLLM.",

    "abstract": "Visual localization is considered to be one of the crucial parts in many\nrobotic and vision systems. While state-of-the art methods that relies on\nfeature matching have proven to be accurate for visual localization, its\nrequirements for storage and compute are burdens. Scene coordinate regression\n(SCR) is an alternative approach that remove the barrier for storage by\nlearning to map 2D pixels to 3D scene coordinates. Most popular SCR use\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract 2D descriptor, which we would\nargue that it miss the spatial relationship between pixels. Inspired by the\nsuccess of vision transformer architecture, we present a new SCR architecture,\ncalled A-ScoRe, an Attention-based model which leverage attention on descriptor\nmap level to produce meaningful and high-semantic 2D descriptors. Since the\noperation is performed on descriptor map, our model can work with multiple data\nmodality whether it is a dense or sparse from depth-map, SLAM to\nStructure-from-Motion (SfM). This versatility allows A-SCoRe to operate in\ndifferent kind of environments, conditions and achieve the level of flexibility\nthat is important for mobile robots. Results show our methods achieve\ncomparable performance with State-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark\nwhile being light-weighted and much more flexible.

To this end, we design data synthesis strategies and curate\nextensive offline datasets from two classic games, Doudizhu and Go.

Additionally, we find that early grounding failures predict later\ninteraction breakdowns. Building on these insights, we introduce Rifts, a\nbenchmark derived from publicly available LLM interaction data containing\nsituations where LLMs fail to initiate grounding.

    "abstract": "Infrasound sensing offers critical capabilities for detecting and geolocating\nbolide events globally. However, the observed back azimuths, directions from\nwhich infrasound signals arrive at stations, often differ from the theoretical\nexpectations based on the bolide's peak brightness location. For objects with\nshallow entry angles, which traverse longer atmospheric paths, acoustic energy\nmay be emitted from multiple points along the trajectory, leading to\nsubstantial variability in back azimuth residuals. This study investigates how\nthe entry angle of energetic bolides affects the back azimuth deviations,\nindependent of extrinsic factors such as atmospheric propagation, station\nnoise, and signal processing methodologies. A theoretical framework, the Bolide\nInfrasound Back-Azimuth EXplorer Model (BIBEX-M), was developed to compute\npredicted back azimuths solely from geometric considerations. The model\nquantifies how these residuals vary as a function of source-to-receiver\ndistance, revealing that bolides entering at shallow angles of 10 degrees can\nexperience average residuals of 20 degrees, with deviations reaching up to 46\ndegrees at distances below 1000 km, and remaining significant even at 10,000\nkm. In contrast, bolides with steeper entry angles (greater than 60 degrees)\nshow much smaller deviations, typically under 5 degrees at 1000 km and\ndiminishing to less than 1 deg beyond 5000 km. These findings attest to the\nneed for careful interpretation when evaluating signal detections and\nestimating bolide locations.

A majority of\nstudies contribute toward alternatives to monolithic structures by\nincorporating sandwiched cores, which are often prone to crushing and\ndelamination. In recent years, sand-based composites have emerged as a\npotentially cost-effective solution. In this ongoing effort, the current\nresearch aims to offer robust protection against ballistic impacts and\nballistic threats. This research investigates the enhancement of ballistic\nimpact resistance in Polymer Matrix Sand Composites (PMSCs) through the\ninclusion of sand in a graded fashion, resulting in a tunable solution. The\ntailoring of various mechanical properties, such as modulus, impact strength,\nand hardness, enables different layers within a single structure, offering\npotential advantages as the projectile pierces through the thickness. The\ngradation creates a stepwise structure, with a base impact zone densely graded\nthat is brittle and hard enough to erode the projectile. Further gradation\ninvolves a less dense region providing tensile strength, which can reflect the\ntensile wave and reduce impact energy. In the preceding study, composites\nunderwent Experimental testing to evaluate mechanical properties. Homogenized\nproperties were extracted to assess PMSCs' behavior under varying constituents.\nThe current study utilizes extracted properties to develop layered structures.\nSimulation studies of varied gradation configurations are conducted, and the\npotential advantages of layering sequences are studied. Preliminary projectile\nimpact studies provide initial insights into gradation performance.

Effect of the effective mass becomes transparent at non-zero\ntemperatures, and it becomes more important as temperature increases. Role of\nthe effective mass is examined thoroughly by calculating the dependence of\nthermodynamic variables such as free energy, internal energy, entropy, pressure\nand chemical potential on density, temperature and proton fraction. We find\nthat sensitivity to the isoscalar effective mass is several times larger than\nthat of the isovector effective mass, so the uncertainties arising from the\neffective mass are dominated by the isoscalar effective mass. In the analysis\nof the relative uncertainty, we obtain that the maximum uncertainty is less\nthan 2% for free energy, internal energy and chemical potential, but it amounts\nto 20% for pressure.

    "abstract": "Top-leading solutions for Video Scene Graph Generation (VSGG) typically adopt\nan offline pipeline. Though demonstrating promising performance, they remain\nunable to handle real-time video streams and consume large GPU memory.\nMoreover, these approaches fall short in temporal reasoning, merely aggregating\nframe-level predictions over a temporal context. In response, we introduce\nDIFFVSGG, an online VSGG solution that frames this task as an iterative scene\ngraph update problem. Drawing inspiration from Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)\nwhich generate images via denoising a latent feature embedding, we unify the\ndecoding of object classification, bounding box regression, and graph\ngeneration three tasks using one shared feature embedding. Then, given an\nembedding containing unified features of object pairs, we conduct a step-wise\nDenoising on it within LDMs, so as to deliver a clean embedding which clearly\nindicates the relationships between objects. This embedding then serves as the\ninput to task-specific heads for object classification, scene graph generation,\netc. DIFFVSGG further facilitates continuous temporal reasoning, where\npredictions for subsequent frames leverage results of past frames as the\nconditional inputs of LDMs, to guide the reverse diffusion process for current\nframes. Extensive experiments on three setups of Action Genome demonstrate the\nsuperiority of DIFFVSGG.",

However, in video understanding with\nmultimodal large language models (LLMs), existing methods primarily rely on\nstatic features extracted from images sampled at a fixed low frame rate of\nframe-per-second (FPS) $\\leqslant$2, leading to critical visual information\nloss. In this paper, we introduce F-16, the first multimodal LLM designed for\nhigh-frame-rate video understanding. By increasing the frame rate to 16 FPS and\ncompressing visual tokens within each 1-second clip, F-16 efficiently captures\ndynamic visual features while preserving key semantic information. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that higher frame rates considerably enhance video\nunderstanding across multiple benchmarks, providing a new approach to improving\nvideo LLMs beyond scaling model size or training data. F-16 achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance among 7-billion-parameter video LLMs on both\ngeneral and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and\nTemporalBench. Furthermore, F-16 excels in complex spatiotemporal tasks,\nincluding high-speed sports analysis (\\textit{e.g.}, basketball, football,\ngymnastics, and diving), outperforming SOTA proprietary visual models like\nGPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-pro.

Current mainstream collaborative perception methods rely on discretized\nfeature maps to conduct fusion, which however, lacks flexibility in extracting\nand transmitting the informative features and can hardly focus on the\ninformative features during fusion. To address these problems, this paper\nproposes a novel Anchor-Centric paradigm for Collaborative Object detection\n(ACCO). It avoids grid precision issues and allows more flexible and efficient\nanchor-centric communication and fusion. ACCO is composed by three main\ncomponents: (1) Anchor featuring block (AFB) that targets to generate anchor\nproposals and projects prepared anchor queries to image features. (2) Anchor\nconfidence generator (ACG) is designed to minimize communication by selecting\nonly the features in the confident anchors to transmit. (3) A local-global\nfusion module, in which local fusion is anchor alignment-based fusion (LAAF)\nand global fusion is conducted by spatial-aware cross-attention (SACA). LAAF\nand SACA run in multi-layers, so agents conduct anchor-centric fusion\niteratively to adjust the anchor proposals. Comprehensive experiments are\nconducted to evaluate ACCO on OPV2V and Dair-V2X datasets, which demonstrate\nACCO's superiority in reducing the communication volume, and in improving the\nperception range and detection performances.

    "abstract": "The transition metal dichalcogenide 6R-TaS$_{2}$ offers a natural platform\nfor studying the interplay among charge density wave (CDW) order,\nsuperconductivity, and transport anomalies. Recent findings reveal that, in the\nintermediate temperature range between charge order and superconductivity, a\nhidden order emerges around $T^{*}$ ${\\simeq}$ 35 K-as evidenced by strong\nmagnetoresistance and an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). However, the nature of\nthe superconducting pairing, the hidden order, and their relationship with the\nCDW remain unclear. Using ${\\mu}$SR, magnetotransport, susceptibility, and\nhydrostatic pressure techniques, we identify a nodal superconducting state with\nlow superfluid density at ambient pressure, with no spontaneous magnetic order\ndetected below $T^{*}$. This indicates that the AHE originates from the band\nstructure rather than magnetism. Under pressures up to 2 GPa, the superfluid\ndensity rises markedly in correlation with the superconducting transition\ntemperature, the nodal pairing shifts to a nodeless state, and the CDW onset is\nreduced by half. Notably, AHE is fully suppressed and magnetoresistance drops\nby 50${\\%}$ within just 0.2 GPa, highlighting the fragility of the hidden\norder. These results reveal an unconventional superconducting pairing in\n6R-TaS$_{2}$, competing with both CDW and hidden orders through weakened\ninterlayer coupling and competition for the same electronic states. With a\nmultifaceted approach, we establish a comprehensive phase diagram that reveals\nthe intricate interplay and competition between the intertwined quantum orders\nin 6R-TaS$_{2}$.",

These\nchallenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nand Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and\nreliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning\nbeyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight\ndistinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in\naverage accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms\nQwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task\ngeneralization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1\noutperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also\nsurpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a\ncrucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1. Our results show that\nomitting intermediate rationales (No-Thinking-Med-R1) not only improves\nin-domain and cross-domain generalization with less training, but also\nchallenges the assumption that more reasoning always helps. These findings\nsuggest that in medical VQA, it is not reasoning itself, but its quality and\ndomain alignment, that determine effectiveness. Together, these results\nhighlight that RL improves medical reasoning and generalization, enabling\nefficient and reliable VLMs for real-world deployment.",

SCORE formulates dataset condensation as a\nmin-max optimization problem, which aims to balance the three key properties\nfrom an information-theoretic perspective.

Automatic brain tumor\ndetection from MRI dataset has garnered significant attention in the research\ncommunity, since the inception of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models.\nHowever, the performance of conventional CNN models is hindered due to class\nimbalance problems. The novelties of this work are as follows: (I) A\nlightweight CNN model is proposed in which the number of filters in different\nconvolutional layers is chosen according to the numbers of Fibonacci series.\n(II) In the last two blocks of the proposed model, depth-wise separable\nconvolution (DWSC) layers are employed to considerably reduce the computational\ncomplexity of the model. (III) Two parallel concatenations (or, skip\nconnections) are deployed from 2nd to 4th, and 3rd to 5th convolutional block\nin the proposed Fibonacci-Net. This skip connection encompasses a novel\nAverage-2Max pooling layer that produces two stacks of convoluted output,\nhaving a bit different statistics. Therefore, this parallel concatenation block\nworks as an efficient feature augmenter inside the model, thus, automatically\nalleviating the class imbalance problem to a certain extent. For validity\npurpose, we have implemented the proposed framework on three MRI datasets which\nare highly class-imbalanced. (a) The first dataset has four classes, i.e.,\nglioma tumor, meningioma tumor, pituitary tumor, and no-tumor. (b) Second and\nthird MRI datasets have 15 and 44 classes respectively. Experimental results\nreveal that, after employing the proposed Fibonacci-Net we have achieved 96.2%\naccuracy, 97.17% precision, 95.9% recall, 96.5% F1 score, and 99.9% specificity\non the most challenging ``44-classes MRI dataset''.",

Furthermore,\nthe device's photoresponse is shown to be polarization- and\nwavelength-insensitive, avoiding signal losses associated with narrow spectral\nranges or polarization dependence, and therefore circumventing degradation in\nphotodetector sensitivity.

To resolve this\nissue, we innovatively leverage the sphere as a shared proxy shape of objects\nto learn shape-independent transformation via spherical representations.

Secondly, the spherical\nattention mechanism is designed to propagate and integrate features among\nspherical anchors from a comprehensive perspective, thus mitigating the\ninterference of noise and incomplete point cloud. Lastly, a hyperbolic\ncorrespondence loss function is designed to distinguish subtle distinctions,\nwhich can promote the precision of correspondence prediction.

LLM-based artificial intelligence (AI)\nassistants, such as ChatGPT, have consistently attracted the attention from\nresearchers, investors, and the general public, driving the rapid growth of\nthis industry. With the frequent introduction of new LLMs to the market, it\nbecomes increasingly difficult to differentiate between them, creating a demand\nfor new LLM comparison methods.\n  In this research, the Consistency-focused Similarity Comparison Framework\n(ConSCompF) for generative large language models is proposed. It compares texts\ngenerated by two LLMs and produces a similarity score, indicating the overall\ndegree of similarity between their responses. The main advantage of this\nframework is that it can operate on a small number of unlabeled data, such as\nchatbot instruction prompts, and does not require LLM developers to disclose\nany information about their product.\n  To evaluate the efficacy of ConSCompF, two experiments aimed at identifying\nsimilarities between multiple LLMs are conducted. Additionally, these\nexperiments examine the correlation between the similarity scores generated by\nConSCompF and the differences in the outputs produced by other benchmarking\ntechniques, such as ROUGE-L. Finally, a series of few-shot LLM comparison\nexperiments is conducted to evaluate the performance of ConSCompF in a few-shot\nLLM comparison scenario.\n  The proposed framework can be used for calculating similarity matrices of\nmultiple LLMs, which can be effectively visualized using principal component\nanalysis (PCA).

Therefore, we propose the\nsingle potential evaluation Ehrenfest dynamics (SPEED), a variation of\nEhrenfest dynamics where all trajectories are propagated using a common local\nquadratic effective potential in the diabatic representation. This approach\nreplaces the computational cost of propagating multiple trajectories with the\nevaluation of a single Hessian at each time step. We demonstrate the\nequivalence of standard Ehrenfest dynamics and SPEED in two realistic systems\nwith (at most) quadratic diabatic potential energy surfaces and couplings: a\nquadratic vibronic coupling Hamiltonian model describing internal conversion in\npyrazine and a model of atomic adsorption on a solid surface. The efficiency\ngain of our approach is particularly advantageous in on-the-fly ab initio\napplications.

Existing approaches often learn the structure of a probabilistic\ngraphical model, which encodes these dependencies, by assuming that the\nvariables follow a distribution with a simple parametric form. Moreover, the\ncomputational cost of many algorithms scales poorly for high-dimensional\ndistributions, as they need to estimate all the edges in the graph\nsimultaneously. In this work, we propose a scalable algorithm to infer the\nconditional independence relationships of each variable by exploiting the local\nMarkov property. The proposed method, named Localized Sparsity Identification\nfor Non-Gaussian Distributions (L-SING), estimates the graph by using flexible\nclasses of transport maps to represent the conditional distribution for each\nvariable. We show that L-SING includes existing approaches, such as\nneighborhood selection with Lasso, as a special case. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our algorithm in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings by\ncomparing it to existing methods. Lastly, we show the scalability of the\nproposed approach by applying it to high-dimensional non-Gaussian examples,\nincluding a biological dataset with more than 150 variables.",

As a current bottleneck of building a long-distance quantum\nnetwork, the distribution rate of heralded entanglement between remote network\nnodes is typically much lower than the decoherence rate of each local node,\nwhich obstructs the implementation of a metropolitan-scale quantum network with\nmore than two remote nodes. A promising scheme to accelerate the remote\nentanglement distribution is through multiplexing enhancement based on a\nmultimode quantum network node. In this work, we experimentally realize a\nfunctional $5$-ion quantum network node with two different types of qubits\ninside. We employ a hybrid multiplexing scheme combining the methods of\nmultiple excitation and ion shuttling, in which maximally $44$ time-bin modes\nare generated and sent through a long fiber to boost the entangling rate. Via\nthis scheme, we can generate heralded ion-photon entanglement with a high\nfidelity of $96.8\\%$/$94.6\\%$/$89.8\\%$ with a success rate of\n$263\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$/$40\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$/$4.28\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, over a fiber of\n$3\\,$m/$1\\,$km/$12\\,$km, respectively.

Learned localization methods have shown promise for\novercoming these challenges to provide precise metric localization for\nautonomous vehicles.

Mediation analysis is a powerful framework for\ninvestigating a hypothesized causal chain and when applied to metabolomics\ndata, a large number of correlated metabolites belonging to interconnected\nmetabolic pathways need to be considered as mediators. To identify metabolic\npathways as active mediators, existing approaches typically focus on first\nidentifying individual metabolites as active mediators, followed by post-hoc\nmetabolic pathway determination. These multi-stage procedures make statistical\ninference challenging. We propose a Bayesian biological pathway-guided\nmediation analysis that aims to jointly analyze all metabolites together,\nidentify metabolic pathways directly, and estimate metabolic pathway-specific\nindirect effects. This is accomplished by incorporating existing biological\nknowledge of metabolic pathways to account for correlations among mediators,\nalong with variable selection and dimension reduction techniques.

Recent advancements in Gaia\nastrometric data provide an unprecedented opportunity to study OC groups in\ngreater detail. This study aims to extend the sample of OC groups and\ninvestigate their formation and evolution mechanisms, with a focus on the role\nof stellar feedback in triggering star formation. We identify four new OC\ngroups based on Gaia data, whose member OCs are spatially proximate and\nkinematically coherent. Their age spreads are consistent with the timescale of\ncontinuous star formation, suggesting that their member OCs formed sequentially\nfrom the same molecular cloud. N-body simulation results further reveal that\nthese groups will gradually disperse, evolving into independent OCs. By\nanalyzing the correlation between OC ages and their separation from potential\nSN explosion sites, we predict SN explosion regions around the birthplaces of\nOC groups. The strong correlation between OC ages and predicted SN explosion\nsites supports a supernova-triggered star formation scenario. Additionally, we\ntrace pulsar (PSR) orbits to examine their association with these regions. We\ndetected three PSRs near Group 1 and 26 PSRs near Group 2, whose birthplaces\nalign with the predicted SN explosions regions. The presence of PSRs associated\nwith OC groups provides additional observational evidence for SN explosions in\nthis region, further supporting a supernova-triggered star formation scenario\nfor G1 and G2. We propose that multiple SN explosions in a short period\ntriggered the formation of Group 1 and Group 2, reinforcing the hierarchical\nstar formation model.

A spin-$1$ model\nquantitatively captures the full details of the spin excitation spectra across\nall low-temperature phases, providing direct evidence of the spin nematic\norders. Additionally, we show evidence of the 3-magnon continuum and 2-magnon\nbound states in the $1/3$-magnetization plateau, revealing condensation of the\n2-magnon bound state as the origin of the low-field spin nematic supersolid\nphase.",

    "abstract": "Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) is the process of identifying and\nextracting relations between entities that span multiple sentences within a\ndocument. Due to its realistic settings, DocRE has garnered increasing research\nattention in recent years. Previous research has mostly focused on developing\nsophisticated encoding models to better capture the intricate patterns between\nentity pairs. While these advancements are undoubtedly crucial, an even more\nfoundational challenge lies in the data itself. The complexity inherent in\nDocRE makes the labeling process prone to errors, compounded by the extreme\nsparsity of positive relation samples, which is driven by both the limited\navailability of positive instances and the broad diversity of positive relation\ntypes. These factors can lead to biased optimization processes, further\ncomplicating the task of accurate relation extraction. Recognizing these\nchallenges, we have developed a robust framework called \\textit{\\textbf{COMM}}\nto better solve DocRE. \\textit{\\textbf{COMM}} operates by initially employing\nan instance-aware reasoning method to dynamically capture pertinent information\nof entity pairs within the document and extract relational features. Following\nthis, \\textit{\\textbf{COMM}} takes into account the distribution of relations\nand the difficulty of samples to dynamically adjust the margins between\nprediction logits and the decision threshold, a process we call Concentrated\nMargin Maximization. In this way, \\textit{\\textbf{COMM}} not only enhances the\nextraction of relevant relational features but also boosts DocRE performance by\naddressing the specific challenges posed by the data. Extensive experiments and\nanalysis demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of\n\\textit{\\textbf{COMM}}, especially its robustness when trained on low-quality\ndata (achieves \\textgreater 10\\% performance gains).",

    "abstract": "Multi-label learning poses significant challenges in extracting reliable\nsupervisory signals from the label space. Existing approaches often employ\ncontinuous pseudo-labels to replace binary labels, improving supervisory\ninformation representation. However, these methods can introduce noise from\nirrelevant labels and lead to unreliable graph structures. To overcome these\nlimitations, this study introduces a novel multi-label feature selection method\ncalled Binary Hashing and Dynamic Graph Constraint (BHDG), the first method to\nintegrate binary hashing into multi-label learning. BHDG utilizes\nlow-dimensional binary hashing codes as pseudo-labels to reduce noise and\nimprove representation robustness. A dynamically constrained sample projection\nspace is constructed based on the graph structure of these binary\npseudo-labels, enhancing the reliability of the dynamic graph. To further\nenhance pseudo-label quality, BHDG incorporates label graph constraints and\ninner product minimization within the sample space. Additionally, an\n$l_{2,1}$-norm regularization term is added to the objective function to\nfacilitate the feature selection process. The augmented Lagrangian multiplier\n(ALM) method is employed to optimize binary variables effectively.\nComprehensive experiments on 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHDG\noutperforms ten state-of-the-art methods across six evaluation metrics. BHDG\nachieves the highest overall performance ranking, surpassing the next-best\nmethod by an average of at least 2.7 ranks per metric, underscoring its\neffectiveness and robustness in multi-label feature selection.",

To fill in this gap,\na set of fixed-bed flume tests were conducted to reveal the hydrodynamic\ndetails of two typical AR shapes (cubic and hemisphere) tightly placed around a\nmonopile in a 3x3 pattern. In parallel, a set of live-bed tests were conducted\nto demonstrate the AR's efficiency in scour protection.

The hemisphere ARs also significantly weaken the wake\nflow but guide descending flow in front of the monopile. While cubic ARs\ndecrease upstream and downstream scour depth by up to 100%, their edge scour\ncan lead to ARs displacement and hence reduce scour protection.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in motion diffusion models have led to remarkable progress in\ndiverse motion generation tasks, including text-to-motion synthesis. However,\nexisting approaches represent motions as dense frame sequences, requiring the\nmodel to process redundant or less informative frames. The processing of dense\nanimation frames imposes significant training complexity, especially when\nlearning intricate distributions of large motion datasets even with modern\nneural architectures. This severely limits the performance of generative motion\nmodels for downstream tasks. Inspired by professional animators who mainly\nfocus on sparse keyframes, we propose a novel diffusion framework explicitly\ndesigned around sparse and geometrically meaningful keyframes. Our method\nreduces computation by masking non-keyframes and efficiently interpolating\nmissing frames. We dynamically refine the keyframe mask during inference to\nprioritize informative frames in later diffusion steps. Extensive experiments\nshow that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\ntext alignment and motion realism, while also effectively maintaining high\nperformance at significantly fewer diffusion steps. We further validate the\nrobustness of our framework by using it as a generative prior and adapting it\nto different downstream tasks.",

Preprints accelerate knowledge dissemination but\nvary in quality, posing challenges for systematic reviews.\n  Methods. We propose AutoConfidence (automated confidence assessment), an\nadvanced framework for predicting preprint publication, which reduces reliance\non manual curation and expands the range of predictors, including three key\nadvancements: (1) automated data extraction using natural language processing\ntechniques, (2) semantic embeddings of titles and abstracts, and (3) large\nlanguage model (LLM)-driven evaluation scores. Additionally, we employed two\nprediction models: a random forest classifier for binary outcome and a survival\ncure model that predicts both binary outcome and publication risk over time.\n  Results. The random forest classifier achieved AUROC 0.692 with LLM-driven\nscores, improving to 0.733 with semantic embeddings and 0.747 with article\nusage metrics. The survival cure model reached AUROC 0.716 with LLM-driven\nscores, improving to 0.731 with semantic embeddings.

This inherent complexity presents significant challenges to Kohn-Sham\ndensity functional theory (KS-DFT), the most widely used electronic structure\nmethod in condensed matter physics and materials science.

The mean-field nature of KS\nimplementations, combined with the limitations of current exchange-correlation\ndensity functional approximations, has led to the perception that DFT is\ninadequate for correlated systems, particularly TMCs.

    "abstract": "Political advertising plays a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and\ninfluencing electoral outcomes, often through subtle persuasive techniques\nembedded in broader propaganda strategies. Detecting these persuasive elements\nis crucial for enhancing voter awareness and ensuring transparency in\ndemocratic processes. This paper presents an integrated approach that bridges\nmodel development and real-world application through two interconnected\nstudies. First, we introduce a lightweight model for persuasive text detection\nthat achieves state-of-the-art performance in Subtask 3 of SemEval 2023 Task 3\nwhile requiring significantly fewer computational resources and training data\nthan existing methods. Second, we demonstrate the model's practical utility by\ncollecting the Australian Federal Election 2022 Facebook Ads (APA22) dataset,\npartially annotating a subset for persuasion, and fine-tuning the model to\nadapt from mainstream news to social media content. We then apply the\nfine-tuned model to label the remainder of the APA22 dataset, revealing\ndistinct patterns in how political campaigns leverage persuasion through\ndifferent funding strategies, word choices, demographic targeting, and temporal\nshifts in persuasion intensity as election day approaches. Our findings not\nonly underscore the necessity of domain-specific modeling for analyzing\npersuasion on social media but also show how uncovering these strategies can\nenhance transparency, inform voters, and promote accountability in digital\ncampaigns.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces structure preserving hierarchical decompositions for\nsampling Gaussian random fields (GRF) within the context of multilevel Bayesian\ninference in high-dimensional space. Existing scalable hierarchical sampling\nmethods, such as those based on stochastic partial differential equation\n(SPDE), often reduce the dimensionality of the sample space at the cost of\naccuracy of inference. Other approaches, such that those based on\nKarhunen-Lo\\`eve (KL) expansions, offer sample space dimensionality reduction\nbut sacrifice GRF representation accuracy and ergodicity of the Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, and are computationally expensive for\nhigh-dimensional problems. The proposed method integrates the dimensionality\nreduction capabilities of KL expansions with the scalability of stochastic\npartial differential equation (SPDE)-based sampling, thereby providing a\nrobust, unified framework for high-dimensional uncertainty quantification (UQ)\nthat is scalable, accurate, preserves ergodicity, and offers dimensionality\nreduction of the sample space. The hierarchy in our multilevel algorithm is\nderived from the geometric multigrid hierarchy. By constructing a hierarchical\ndecomposition that maintains the covariance structure across the levels in the\nhierarchy, the approach enables efficient coarse-to-fine sampling while\nensuring that all samples are drawn from the desired distribution. The\neffectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a benchmark subsurface\nflow problem, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving computational\nefficiency and statistical accuracy. Our proposed technique is more efficient,\naccurate, and displays better convergence properties than existing methods for\nhigh-dimensional Bayesian inference problems.",

While earlier approaches\nleverage generative models like autoencoders and generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs), they often fall short due to overgeneralization. Recent\nmethods explore various strategies, including memory banks, normalizing flows,\nself-supervised learning, and knowledge distillation, to enhance\ndiscrimination. Among these, knowledge distillation, particularly reverse\ndistillation, has shown promise. Following this paradigm, we propose a novel\nscale-aware contrastive reverse distillation model that addresses two key\nlimitations of existing reverse distillation methods: insufficient feature\ndiscriminability and inability to handle anomaly scale variations.\nSpecifically, we introduce a contrastive student-teacher learning approach to\nderive more discriminative representations by generating and exploring\nout-of-normal distributions. Further, we design a scale adaptation mechanism to\nsoftly weight contrastive distillation losses at different scales to account\nfor the scale variation issue.

First, the results\nquantitatively confirm the previous observation that vertical motions dominate\nand that the anisotropic flows are widely distributed in the entire ALT region\nwith the contribution from both upflows and downflows. Second, the anisotropy\nshows height-dependent features, with the most substantial anisotropy appearing\nat a certain middle height in ALT, which agrees well with the MHD modeling\nresults where turbulent flows are caused by Rayleigh-Taylor-type instabilities\nin the ALT region. Finally, our finding suggests that supra-arcade downflows\n(SADs), the most prominently visible dynamical structures in ALT regions, are\nonly one aspect of turbulent flows. Among these turbulent flows, we also report\nthe anti-sunward-moving underdense flows that might develop due to MHD\ninstabilities, as suggested by previous three-dimensional flare models.

Second, we regularize reward learning by incorporating the agent's\nperformance, ensuring that the reward model is optimized based on data\ngenerated by the current policy; this addition boosts episode returns by 20-30%\nin locomotion tasks. Empirical studies on metaworld demonstrate that our method\nachieves, for instance, around 70-80% success rate in all tasks, compared to\nbelow 50% for standard approaches.

    "abstract": "World models significantly enhance hierarchical understanding, improving data\nintegration and learning efficiency. To explore the potential of the world\nmodel in the remote sensing (RS) field, this paper proposes a label-efficient\nremote sensing world model for multimodal data fusion (FusDreamer). The\nFusDreamer uses the world model as a unified representation container to\nabstract common and high-level knowledge, promoting interactions across\ndifferent types of data, \\emph{i.e.}, hyperspectral (HSI), light detection and\nranging (LiDAR), and text data. Initially, a new latent diffusion fusion and\nmultimodal generation paradigm (LaMG) is utilized for its exceptional\ninformation integration and detail retention capabilities. Subsequently, an\nopen-world knowledge-guided consistency projection (OK-CP) module incorporates\nprompt representations for visually described objects and aligns\nlanguage-visual features through contrastive learning. In this way, the domain\ngap can be bridged by fine-tuning the pre-trained world models with limited\nsamples. Finally, an end-to-end multitask combinatorial optimization (MuCO)\nstrategy can capture slight feature bias and constrain the diffusion process in\na collaboratively learnable direction. Experiments conducted on four typical\ndatasets indicate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed FusDreamer.\nThe corresponding code will be released at\nhttps://github.com/Cimy-wang/FusDreamer.",

However, existing methods rely on domain expertise and\nface challenges in adapting to dynamic production constraints. Additionally,\nenterprises have high privacy requirements for production scheduling data,\nwhich prevents the use of cloud-based large language models (LLMs) for solution\ndevelopment. To address these challenges, there is an urgent need for an\nautomated modeling solution that meets data privacy requirements. This study\nproposes a knowledge-augmented mixed integer linear programming (MILP)\nautomated formulation framework, integrating local LLMs with domain-specific\nknowledge bases to generate executable code from natural language descriptions\nautomatically. The framework employs a knowledge-guided\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model to extract complex spatiotemporal\nconstraints (82% average accuracy) and leverages a supervised fine-tuned\nQwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct model for efficient MILP code generation (90% average\naccuracy). Experimental results demonstrate that the framework successfully\nachieves automatic modeling in the aircraft skin manufacturing case while\nensuring data privacy and computational efficiency.

Existing medical image segmentation methods predominantly\nrely on uni-modal visual inputs, such as images or videos, requiring\nlabor-intensive manual annotations. Additionally, medical imaging techniques\ncapture multiple intertwined organs within a single scan, further complicating\nsegmentation accuracy. To address these challenges, MedSAM, a large-scale\nmedical segmentation model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), was\ndeveloped to enhance segmentation accuracy by integrating image features with\nuser-provided prompts. While MedSAM has demonstrated strong performance across\nvarious medical segmentation tasks, it primarily relies on geometric prompts\n(e.g., points and bounding boxes) and lacks support for text-based prompts,\nwhich could help specify subtle or ambiguous anatomical structures. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose the Organ-aware Multi-scale Text-guided Medical\nImage Segmentation Model (OMT-SAM) for multi-organ segmentation. Our approach\nintroduces CLIP encoders as a novel image-text prompt encoder, operating with\nthe geometric prompt encoder to provide informative contextual guidance. We\npair descriptive textual prompts with corresponding images, processing them\nthrough pre-trained CLIP encoders and a cross-attention mechanism to generate\nfused image-text embeddings. Additionally, we extract multi-scale visual\nfeatures from MedSAM, capturing fine-grained anatomical details at different\nlevels of granularity. We evaluate OMT-SAM on the FLARE 2021 dataset,\nbenchmarking its performance against existing segmentation methods.

Gridded harmonic data, used commonly in\nMPI, does not map to underlying iron density but rather to the iron density\nconvolved with the harmonic point-spread functions. We refer to the gridded\nharmonic data as harmonic portraits, since they only represent a portrait-like\nrepresentation of the iron density, and a deconvolution method is implemented\nto reconstruct the true underlying density. The advantage of this new method is\nprimarily in the intermediate data analysis that comes in the harmonic portrait\ndomain, where we are able to perform artifact correction, parameter selection,\nand general data assessment and calibrations efficiently.

Traditional far-field beam training methods become\ninadequate, while near-field training faces the challenge of large codebooks\ndue to the need to resolve both angular and distance domains. To reduce in-band\ntraining overhead, prior work has proposed to leverage the spatial-temporal\ncongruence between sub-6 GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels to predict the best\nmmWave beam within a near-field codebook from sub-6G channel estimates. To cope\nwith the uncertainty caused by sub-6G/mmWave differences, we introduce a novel\nSub-6G Channel Aided Near-field BEam SelecTion (SCAN-BEST) framework that wraps\naround any beam predictor to produce candidate beam subset with formal\nsuboptimality guarantees. The proposed SCAN-BEST builds on conformal risk\ncontrol (CRC), and is calibrated offline using limited calibration data. Its\nperformance guarantees apply even in the presence of statistical shifts between\ncalibration and deployment. Numerical results validate the theoretical\nproperties and efficiency of SCAN-BEST.",

More than\na century of research on solar filaments suggests that the slow evolution of\nphotospheric magnetic fields plays a decisive role in initiating filament\neruptions, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Using high-resolution\nobservations from the \\textit{Chinese H$\\alpha$ Solar Explorer}, the\n\\textit{Solar Upper Transition Region Imager}, and the \\textit{Solar Dynamics\nObservatory}, we present direct evidence that a giant solar filament eruption\nis triggered by a series of minifilament eruptions occurring beneath it. These\nminifilaments, which are homologous to the giant filament but on a smaller\ntempo-spatial scale, sequently form and erupt due to extremely weak mutual flux\ndisappearance of opposite-polarity photospheric magnetic fields. Through\nmulti-fold magnetic interactions, these erupting minifilaments act as the last\nstraw to break the force balance of the overlying giant filament and initiate\nits ultimate eruption. The results unveil a possible novel pathway for\nsmall-scale magnetic activities near the stellar surface to initiate\nspectacular filament eruptions, and provide new insight into the magnetic\ncoupling of filament eruptions across different tempo-spatial scales.",

Starting with a continuous plate\nwaveguide based on a periodic distribution of pillars, local resonators and\nwaveguides are created by eliminating selected pillars and by exploiting the\nconcept of point and line defects. The height of selected pillars is adjusted\nto tune the coupling strength between different resonators.

Numerical simulations and experimental results confirm the\nvalidity of the design by showing the emergence of topological edge modes at\nthe interface of topologically distinct systems.

Although modern DL frameworks rely on\ncompilerlike optimizations internally, BurTorch takes a different path. It\nadopts a minimalist design and demonstrates that, in these circumstances,\nclassical compiled programming languages can play a significant role in DL\nresearch. By eliminating the overhead of large frameworks and making efficient\nimplementation choices, BurTorch achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in\nperformance and memory efficiency when computing $\\nabla f(x)$ on a CPU.\nBurTorch features a compact codebase designed to achieve two key goals\nsimultaneously. First, it provides a user experience similar to script-based\nprogramming environments. Second, it dramatically minimizes runtime overheads.\nIn large DL frameworks, the primary source of memory overhead for relatively\nsmall computation graphs $f(x)$ is due to feature-heavy implementations. We\nbenchmarked BurTorch against widely used DL frameworks in their execution\nmodes: JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018), PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019), TensorFlow\n(Abadi et al., 2016); and several standalone libraries: Autograd (Maclaurin et\nal., 2015), Micrograd (Karpathy, 2020), Apple MLX (Hannun et al., 2023).

We reproduce several\nknown features of the reaction mechanism, including the proton relay that\nconducts protons out of the active site to the His64 residue. Additionally, we\nobserve a new reaction pathway where CO$_2$ reacts with a water molecule in the\nactive site, which donates a proton to the zinc-bound hydroxide. This differs\nfrom the established mechanism where CO$_2$ directly reacts with hydroxide.\nExisting experimental data and independent quantum chemistry calculations are\nused to support the plausibility of this new mechanism. This demonstrates the\npotential of Orb to efficiently generate novel insights into important\nmolecular scale processes that can potentially be harnessed to improve CO$_2$\ncapture technologies and drug design.",

    "abstract": "Many resources in the grid connect to power grids via programmable\ngrid-interfacing inverters that can provide grid services and offer greater\ncontrol flexibility and faster response times compared to synchronous\ngenerators. However, the current through the inverter needs to be limited to\nprotect the semiconductor components. Existing controllers are designed using\nsomewhat ad hoc methods, for example, by adding current limiters to preexisting\ncontrol loops, which can lead to stability issues or overly conservative\noperations.\n  In this paper, we study the geometry of the feasible output region of a\ncurrent-limited inverter. We show that under a commonly used model, the\nfeasible region is convex. We provide an explicit characterization of this\nregion, which allows us to efficiently find the optimal operating points of the\ninverter. We demonstrate how knowing the feasible set and its convexity allows\nus to improve upon existing grid-forming inverters such that their steady-state\ncurrents always remain within the current magnitude limit, whereas standard\ngrid-forming controllers can lead to instabilities and violations.",

    "abstract": "This research evaluates the extent to which modern AI frameworks,\nspecifically TensorFlow and scikit-learn, adhere to the SOLID design principles\n- Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface\nSegregation, and Dependency Inversion. Analyzing the frameworks architectural\ndocumentation and design philosophies, this research investigates architectural\ntrade-offs when balancing software engineering best practices with AI-specific\nneeds. I examined each frameworks documentation, source code, and architectural\ncomponents to evaluate their adherence to these principles. The results show\nthat both frameworks adopt certain aspects of SOLID design principles but make\nintentional trade-offs to address performance, scalability, and the\nexperimental nature of AI development. TensorFlow focuses on performance and\nscalability, sometimes sacrificing strict adherence to principles like Single\nResponsibility and Interface Segregation. While scikit-learns design philosophy\naligns more closely with SOLID principles through consistent interfaces and\ncomposition principles, sticking closer to SOLID guidelines but with occasional\ndeviations for performance optimizations and scalability. This research\ndiscovered that applying SOLID principles in AI frameworks depends on context,\nas performance, scalability, and flexibility often require deviations from\ntraditional software engineering principles. This research contributes to\nunderstanding how domain-specific constraints influence architectural decisions\nin modern AI frameworks and how these frameworks strategically adapted design\nchoices to effectively balance these contradicting requirements.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to the assumptions of most existing Electromigration (EM)\nanalysis tools, the evolution of EM-induced stress is inherently\nnon-deterministic, influenced by factors such as input current fluctuations and\nmanufacturing non-idealities. Traditional approaches for estimating stress\nvariations typically involve computationally expensive and inefficient Monte\nCarlo simulations with industrial solvers, which quantify variations using mean\nand variance metrics. In this work, we introduce a novel machine learning-based\nframework, termed BPINNEM- Post, for efficient stochastic analysis of\nEM-induced postvoiding aging processes. This new approach integrates closedform\nanalytical solutions with a Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (BPINN)\nframework to accelerate the analysis for the first time. The closed-form\nsolutions enforce physical laws at the individual wire segment level, while the\nBPINN ensures that physics constraints at inter-segment junctions are satisfied\nand stochastic behaviors are accurately modeled. By reducing the number of\nvariables in the loss functions through the use of analytical solutions, our\nmethod significantly improves training efficiency without accuracy loss and\nnaturally incorporates variational effects. Additionally, the analytical\nsolutions effectively address the challenge of incorporating initial stress\ndistributions in interconnect structures during post-void stress calculations.\nNumerical results demonstrate that BPINN-EM-Post achieves over 240x speedup\ncompared to Monte Carlo simulations using the FEM-based COMSOL solver and more\nthan 65x speedup compared to Monte Carlo simulations using the FDM-based\nEMSpice method.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms consist of dozens to\nhundreds of drones with different roles and varying hardware and software\nrequirements collaborating towards a shared mission. While traditional\napproaches for synchronized software updates assume swarms to be unstructured\nand homogeneous, the heterogeneous nature of modern swarms and the emerging\nneed of drones to update their deep learning (perception) models with new\nobjectives or data as a mission unfolds, has made efficient software update\nmethods crucial for swarms to adapt to dynamic environments. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce the SwarmUpdate framework for software updates in\nheterogeneous UAV swarms, composed of two key components: SwarmSync and\nSwarmModelPatch. SwarmSync is a hierarchical software update synchronization\nstrategy to distribute a software update to the right subset of drones within a\nswarm, while SwarmModelPatch is a deep learning model patching method that\nreduces the size of a (deep learning model) update by only allowing some layers\nof the model to be updated (freezing the other layers). In this paper, we\nsystematically evaluate the performance of SwarmSync through large-scale\nsimulations in the ARGoS swarm simulator, comparing SwarmSync to auction-based\n(SOUL) and gossip-based rebroadcasting (Gossip) baselines, and SwarmModelPatch\nto a non-incremental model patching strategy.",
