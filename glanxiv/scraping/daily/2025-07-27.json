    "abstract": "The mining of pattern subgraphs, known as motifs, is a core task in the field\nof graph mining. Edges in real-world networks often have timestamps, so there\nis a need for temporal motif mining. A temporal motif is a richer structure\nthat imposes timing constraints on the edges of the motif. Temporal motifs have\nbeen used to analyze social networks, financial transactions, and biological\nnetworks.\n  Motif counting in temporal graphs is particularly challenging. A graph with\nmillions of edges can have trillions of temporal motifs, since the same edge\ncan occur with multiple timestamps. There is a combinatorial explosion of\npossibilities, and state-of-the-art algorithms cannot manage motifs with more\nthan four vertices.\n  In this work, we present TIMEST: a general, fast, and accurate estimation\nalgorithm to count temporal motifs of arbitrary sizes in temporal networks. Our\napproach introduces a temporal spanning tree sampler that leverages weighted\nsampling to generate substructures of target temporal motifs. This method\ncarefully takes a subset of temporal constraints of the motif that can be\njointly and efficiently sampled. TIMEST uses randomized estimation techniques\nto obtain accurate estimates of motif counts.\n  We give theoretical guarantees on the running time and approximation\nguarantees of TIMEST. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and show\nthat TIMEST is both faster and more accurate than previous algorithms. Our CPU\nimplementation exhibits an average speedup of 28x over state-of-the-art GPU\nimplementation of the exact algorithm, and 6x speedup over SOTA approximate\nalgorithms while consistently showcasing less than 5% error in most cases. For\nexample, TIMEST can count the number of instances of a financial fraud temporal\nmotif in four minutes with 0.6% error, while exact methods take more than two\ndays.",

Its extensive utilities, including diverse GNN\narchitectures, and compatibility with established Python packages (e.g.,\nscikit-learn, PyTorch, NetworkX), enhance usability and facilitate quick\nadoption.

Our goal is to elucidate the latter boundary layers, termed surface\nBloch (SB) waves, affiliated with rational surface cuts and homogeneous Neumann\ndata. To this end we adopt the scalar wave equation with periodic coefficients\nas a test bed and develop a unit cell-of-periodicity-based, reduced order model\nof the SB waves that is capable of describing both their dispersion, waveforms,\nand ``skin depth''. The centerpiece of our analysis is a quadratic eigenvalue\nproblem (QEP) for the effective unit cell of periodicity -- deriving from a\ngeometric interplay between the mother Bravais lattice, orientation of the\nsurface cut, and the direction of SB wave -- that seeks the complex wavenumber\nnormal to the cut plane given (i) the excitation frequency and (ii) wavenumber\nin the direction of the SB wave. In this way the sought boundary layer is\nderived via superposition of the evanescent QEP eigenstates, whose strengths\nare obtained by imposing the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. With the\nQEP eigenspectrum at hand, evaluation of an SB wave -- in terms of both\ndispersion characteristics and evanescent waveforms -- entails only a\nlow-dimensional eigenvalue problem. This feature caters for rapid exploration\nof the effect of (periodic) surface undulations, and so enables manipulation of\nthe SB waves via optimal design of the surface cut.

In this study, we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework, ResCap-DBP, that combines a residual learning-based encoder\nwith a one-dimensional Capsule Network (1D-CapsNet) to predict DBPs directly\nfrom raw protein sequences. Our architecture incorporates dilated convolutions\nwithin residual blocks to mitigate vanishing gradient issues and extract rich\nsequence features, while capsule layers with dynamic routing capture\nhierarchical and spatial relationships within the learned feature space. We\nconducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings\nfrom ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that\nProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large\ndatasets. Although one-hot encoding showed marginal advantages on smaller\ndatasets, such as PDB186, it struggled to scale effectively. Extensive\nevaluations on four pairs of publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It\nachieved AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on PDB14189andPDB1075, respectively.

    "abstract": "Gestural language is used by deaf & mute communities to communicate through\nhand gestures & body movements that rely on visual-spatial patterns known as\nsign languages. Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand\ngestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &\nmute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human\ninteraction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant\nbarriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation\ntechnologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the\nIndian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine\nlearning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf\n& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL\nare less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a\nrobust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset &\ndemonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of\n99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the\nnuanced visual features of different signs. The system's effectiveness is\nrigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1\nscore, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world\napplications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe\nfor precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of\ndynamic gestures.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Low-field MRI systems operate at single MHz-range frequencies, where\nsignal losses are primarily dominated by thermal noise from the radio-frequency\n(RF) receive coils. Achieving operation close to this limit is essential for\nmaximizing imaging performance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However,\nelectromagnetic interference (EMI) from cabling, electronics, and patient\nloading often degrades system performance. Our goal is to develop and validate\na practical protocol that guides users in identifying and suppressing\nelectromagnetic noise in low-field MRI systems, enabling operation near the\nthermal noise limit.\n  Methods: We present a systematic, stepwise methodology that includes\ndiagnostic measurements, hardware isolation strategies, and good practices for\ncabling and shielding. Each step is validated with corresponding noise\nmeasurements under increasingly complex system configurations, both unloaded\nand with a human subject present.\n  Results: Noise levels were monitored through the incremental assembly of a\nlow-field MRI system, revealing key sources of EMI and quantifying their\nimpact. Final configurations achieved noise within 1.5x the theoretical thermal\nbound with a subject in the scanner. Image reconstructions illustrate the\ndirect relationship between system noise and image quality.\n  Conclusion: The proposed protocol enables low-field MRI systems to operate\nclose to fundamental noise limits in realistic conditions.

    "abstract": "Data-intensive applications in data centers, especially machine learning\n(ML), have made the network a bottleneck, which in turn has motivated the\ndevelopment of more efficient network protocols and infrastructure. For\ninstance, remote direct memory access (RDMA) has become the standard protocol\nfor data transport in the cloud as it minimizes data copies and reduces\nCPU-utilization via host-bypassing. Similarly, an increasing amount of network\nfunctions and infrastructure have moved to accelerators, SmartNICs, and\nin-network computing to bypass the CPU. In this paper we explore the\nimplementation and deployment of RoCE BALBOA, an open-source, RoCE\nv2-compatible, scalable up to hundreds of queue-pairs, and 100G-capable\nRDMA-stack that can be used as the basis for building accelerators and\nsmartNICs. RoCE BALBOA is customizable, opening up a design space and offering\na degree of adaptability not available in commercial products. We have deployed\nBALBOA in a cluster using FPGAs and show that it has latency and performance\ncharacteristics comparable to commercial NICs. We demonstrate its potential by\nexploring two classes of use cases. One involves enhancements to the protocol\nfor infrastructure purposes (encryption, deep packet inspection using ML). The\nother showcases the ability to perform line-rate compute offloads with deep\npipelines by implementing commercial data preprocessing pipelines for\nrecommender systems that process the data as it arrives from the network before\ntransferring it directly to the GPU. These examples demonstrate how BALBOA\nenables the exploration and development of SmartNICs and accelerators operating\non network data streams.",

Using a dataset of\napproximately ten million online job vacancies from 2018 to 2024, we identify\nAI roles-positions requiring at least one AI-related skill-and examine the\nextent to which these roles offer non-monetary benefits such as tuition\nassistance, paid leave, health and well-being perks, parental leave, workplace\nculture enhancements, and remote work options. While previous research has\ndocumented substantial wage premiums for AI-related roles due to growing demand\nand limited talent supply, our study asks whether this demand also translates\ninto enhanced non-monetary compensation. We find that AI roles are\nsignificantly more likely to offer such perks, even after controlling for\neducation requirements, industry, and occupation type. It is twice as likely\nfor an AI role to offer parental leave and almost three times more likely to\nprovide remote working options. Moreover, the highest-paying AI roles tend to\nbundle these benefits, suggesting a compound premium where salary increases\ncoincide with expanded non-monetary rewards. AI roles offering parental leave\nor health benefits show salaries that are, on average, 12% to 20% higher than\nAI roles without this benefit. This pattern is particularly pronounced in years\nand occupations experiencing the highest AI-related demand, pointing to a\ndemand-driven dynamic. Our findings underscore the strong pull of AI talent in\nthe labor market and challenge narratives of technological displacement,\nhighlighting instead how employers compete for scarce talent through both\nfinancial and non-financial incentives.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Background: The rational identification of essential genes is a cornerstone\nof drug discovery, yet standard computational methods like Flux Balance\nAnalysis (FBA) often struggle to produce accurate predictions in complex,\nredundant metabolic networks. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the topological\nstructure of a metabolic network contains a more robust predictive signal for\nessentiality than functional simulations alone. Methodology: To test this\nhypothesis, we developed a machine learning pipeline by first constructing a\nreaction-reaction graph from the e_coli_core metabolic model. Graph-theoretic\nfeatures, including betweenness centrality and PageRank, were engineered to\ndescribe the topological role of each gene. A RandomForestClassifier was\ntrained on these features, and its performance was rigorously benchmarked\nagainst a standard FBA single-gene deletion analysis using a curated\nground-truth dataset. Results: Our machine learning model achieved a solid\npredictive performance with an F1-Score of 0.400 (Precision: 0.412, Recall:\n0.389). In profound contrast, the standard FBA baseline method failed to\ncorrectly identify any of the known essential genes, resulting in an F1-Score\nof 0.000. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that a \"structure-first\" machine\nlearning approach is a significantly superior strategy for predicting gene\nessentiality compared to traditional FBA on the E. coli core network. By\nlearning the topological signatures of critical network roles, our model\nsuccessfully overcomes the known limitations of simulation-based methods in\nhandling biological redundancy. While the performance of topology-only models\nis expected to face challenges on more complex genome-scale networks, this\nvalidated framework represents a significant step forward and highlights the\nprimacy of network architecture in determining biological function.",

The Hochschule Darmstadt, Fraunhofer-IGD, and Facephi company\njointly organised this challenge. 20 teams were registered, and 74 submitted\nmodels were evaluated. For Track 1, the \"Dragons\" team reached first place with\nan Average Ranking and Equal Error rate (EER) of AV-Rank of 40.48% and 11.44%\nEER, respectively. For the more challenging approach in Track 2, the \"Incode\"\nteam reached the best results with an AV-Rank of 14.76% and 6.36% EER,\nimproving on the results of the first edition of 74.30% and 21.87% EER,\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "Continuous Integration (CI) configurations often need to be migrated between\nservices (e.g., Travis CI to GitHub Actions) as projects evolve, due to changes\nin service capabilities, usage limits, or service deprecation. Previous studies\nreported that migration across CI services is a recurring need in open-source\ndevelopment. However, manual migration can be time-consuming and error-prone.\nThe state-of-the-art approach, CIMig, addresses this challenge by analyzing\npast migration examples to create service-specific rules and produce equivalent\nconfigurations across CI services. However, its relatively low accuracy raises\nconcerns about the overall feasibility of automated CI migration using\nrule-based techniques alone. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated strong capabilities in code generation and transformation tasks,\nsuggesting potential to improve the automation, usability, and generalizability\nof CI configuration migration. This registered report presents a study in which\nwe aim to assess whether CI migration can be improved using LLMs. To this end,\nwe propose CIgrate, an LLM-based framework for automatically migrating CI\nconfigurations. We plan to evaluate the performance of CIgrate compared to\nCIMig as a baseline, in different setups (a) zero-shot/few-shot prompting of\nLLMs for configuration migration and (b) fine-tuning an LLM on a dataset of\nalready established CI service migrations. We will also seek developer feedback\non the quality and usability of the generated configurations. We formulate\nresearch questions focusing on the accuracy of LLM-generated migrations versus\nground truth and the output of CIMig. The expected contributions include the\nfirst LLM-powered approach for CI service migration, a comparative evaluation\nof its effectiveness compared to rule-based approaches, and insight into\nleveraging LLMs to support software configuration evolution.",

Despite advances\nin language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs\nperform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for\nagents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this\ngap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure\nspatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our\nmethodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of\nvarying complexity ($5\\times 5$ to $15\\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate\nfeedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test\nfundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across\nidentical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic\ntransfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while\nOpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\\times 30$,\nother models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\\times 9$ mazes, with 100%\nof failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a\ncell at least 10 times.

A major\nproblem for UAV RC links in the ISM bands is that other types of interference\nsources, such as legacy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth transmissions, may degrade the link\nquality. Such interference problems are a higher concern for the UAV in the air\nthan the RC unit on the ground due to the UAV being in line-of-sight (LoS) with\na larger number of interference sources. To obtain empirical evidence of the\nasymmetric interference conditions in downlink (DL) and uplink (UL), we first\nconducted a measurement campaign using a helikite platform in urban and rural\nareas at NC State University. The results from this measurement campaign show\nthat the aggregate interference can be up to 16.66 dB at higher altitudes up to\n170 m, compared with the interference observed at a ground receiver. As a\nresult of this asymmetric UL interference, lost hybrid automatic repeat request\n(HARQ) indicators (ACK/NACK) in the UL may degrade the DL throughput. To\ninvestigate this, we study various HARQ mechanisms, including HARQ Type-I with\nno combining, HARQ Type-I with chase combining, HARQ Type-III with incremental\nredundancy, and burst transmission with chase combining. To evaluate the impact\nof asymmetric UL interference on throughput performance, we consider three\nsteps of evaluation process: 1) standalone physical DL shared channel (PDSCH)\nthroughput evaluation with perfect ACK/NACK assumption; 2) standalone physical\nUL control channel (PUCCH) decoding reliability evaluation; and 3) PDSCH DL\nthroughput evaluation with asymmetric UL ACK/NACK transmission.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles are the next revolution in the automobile industry and\nthey are expected to revolutionize the future of transportation. Understanding\nthe scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its\ncompetent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress\nthat has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating\nevery pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene\ncomprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous\nDriving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable\nareas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has\nbeen performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled\non the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more\nchallenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on\nunstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this\npaper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models\nhave been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean\nIntersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and\nSegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the\ndataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five\nmodels and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the\nprocess.",

Recent methods often rely solely on\npixel-level transformations of RGB images, neglecting the rich contextual\ninformation available from multiple visual modalities. In this paper, we\npresent ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that\nfully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer\n(CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating\nmultimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to\nmultimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal\nMulti-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB\ndata with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings,\nsegmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate\ninformation-rich hybrid attention maps. Extensive experiments on multiple\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate ModalFormer's state-of-the-art performance in\nLLIE.

We propose in this work a novel multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning named Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS)\nfor dynamic mobility resource allocation. HAG-PS aims to address two important\nresearch challenges regarding multi-agent reinforcement learning for mobility\nresource allocation: (1) how to dynamically and adaptively share the mobility\nresource allocation policy (i.e., how to distribute mobility resources) across\nagents (i.e., representing the regional coordinators of mobility resources);\nand (2) how to achieve memory-efficient parameter sharing in an urban-scale\nsetting. To address the above challenges, we have provided following novel\ndesigns within HAG-PS. To enable dynamic and adaptive parameter sharing, we\nhave designed a hierarchical approach that consists of global and local\ninformation of the mobility resource states (e.g., distribution of mobility\nresources). We have developed an adaptive agent grouping approach in order to\nsplit or merge the groups of agents based on their relative closeness of\nencoded trajectories (i.e., states, actions, and rewards). We have designed a\nlearnable identity (ID) embeddings to enable agent specialization beyond simple\nparameter copy.

    "abstract": "We investigate rogue wave formation and spectral downshifting in the\nhigher-order nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (HONLS) equation and its dissipative\nextensions: the nonlinear mean-flow damping model (NLD-HONLS) and the viscous\ndamping model (V-HONLS). By applying Floquet spectral analysis, we characterize\ni) the structural organization of the dynamical background and ii) the nature\nof the rogue waves that appear, distinguishing sharply localized, soliton-like\nstructures from more diffuse, spatially extended waveforms with mixed mode\ncharacteristics. In the conservative HONLS, soliton-like rogue waves (SRWs)\narise only for steep initial data, with the dynamics intermittently switching\nbetween periods of SRW formation and periods dominated by a disordered\nmulti-mode background. For moderately steep initial data, only broader, less\ncoherent rogue waves form.\n  Nonlinear damping in the NLD-HONLS model suppresses disorder and supports a\nstable, well-organized Floquet spectra that reflects a sustained soliton-like\nstate from which SRWs emerge, along with strong phase coherence. In contrast,\nviscous damping in the V-HONLS model leads to a disordered Floquet spectral\nevolution with broader, less localized rogue waves and increased phase\nvariability. Furthermore, the NLD-HONLS model shows a close link between rogue\nwave events and the time of permanent downshift, whereas these phenomena appear\ndecoupled in the V-HONLS model. These results clarify how dissipation type and\nwave steepness interact to shape extreme events in near-integrable wave systems\nand highlight the value of spectral diagnostics for studying nonlinear wave\ndynamics.",

However, its unsupervised nature makes\nit inherently challenging. Many existing clustering algorithms suffer from\ncritical limitations: they often require careful parameter tuning, exhibit high\ncomputational complexity, lack interpretability, or yield suboptimal accuracy,\nespecially when applied to large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel clustering approach based on meta-learning. Our approach eliminates the\nneed for parameter optimization while achieving accuracy that outperforms\nstate-of-the-art clustering techniques. The proposed technique leverages a few\npre-clustered samples to guide the clustering process for the entire dataset in\na single forward pass. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained Prior-Data Fitted\nTransformer Network (PFN) to perform clustering. The algorithm computes\nattention between the pre-clustered samples and the unclustered samples,\nallowing it to infer cluster assignments for the entire dataset based on the\nlearned relation. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that, given just\na few pre-clustered examples, the model can generalize to accurately cluster\nthe rest of the dataset. Experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show\nthat our approach can successfully cluster well-separated data without any\npre-clustered samples, and significantly improves performance when a few\nclustered samples are provided. We show that our approach is superior to the\nstate-of-the-art techniques.

Using a 3D General Circulation Model, the Unified\nModel, we capture the advection, settling and radiative impact of Titan-like,\nwater-world-like and soot-like haze, with a particle radius of 1.5 nm. We show\nthat the radiative impact of haze leads to drastic changes in the thermal\nstructure and circulation in the atmosphere. We then show that in all our\nsimulations, 1) the superrotating jet largely determines the day-to-night haze\ndistribution, 2) eddies drive the latitudinal haze distribution, and 3) the\ndivergent and eddy component of the wind control the finer structure of the\nhaze distribution. We further show that the stronger the absorption strength of\nthe haze, the stronger the superrotating jet, lesser the difference of the\nday-to-night haze distribution, and larger the transit depth in the synthetic\ntransmission spectrum. We also demonstrate that the presence of such small\nhazes could result in a stronger haze opacity over the morning terminator in\nall three planets. This could lead to an observable terminator asymmetry in\nWASP-39b, with the morning terminator presenting a larger transit depth than\nthe evening terminator. This work suggests that, although it might not be a\ntypical detection feature for hot-Jupiters, an observed increase in transit\ndepth over the morning terminator across the UV and optical wavelength regime\ncould serve as a strong indicator of the presence of haze.",

ULISSE is able to rapidly and efficiently identify\ncandidates from a single image based on photometric and morphological\nsimilarities to a given reference object with known properties. This approach\nleverages features extracted from the ImageNet dataset to perform similarity\nsearches among all objects in the sample, eliminating the need for extensive\nneural network training. Our experiments, performed on the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey, demonstrate that we are able to predict the joint star formation rate\nand stellar mass of the target galaxies within 1 dex in 60% to 80% of cases,\ndepending on the investigated subsample (quiescent/star-forming galaxies,\nearly-/late-type, etc.), and within 0.5 dex if we consider these parameters\nseparately. This is approximately twice the fraction obtained from a random\nguess extracted from the parent population. Additionally, we find ULISSE is\nmore effective for galaxies with active star formation compared to elliptical\ngalaxies with quenched star formation. Additionally, ULISSE performs more\nefficiently for galaxies with bright nuclei such as AGN.

In this paper, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a\nsuperior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a\nDiffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through\na self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the\nfundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and\nstructural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation.

Our method, termed Diff-FBP,\nsets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson\nCorrelation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art\nbased on general-purpose pre-training.

Specifically, MH-GIN first extracts multi-scale\ntemporal features for each attribute while preserving their intrinsic\nheterogeneous characteristics. Then, it constructs a multi-scale heterogeneous\ngraph to explicitly model dependencies between heterogeneous attributes to\nenable more accurate imputation of missing values through graph propagation.\nExperimental results on two real-world datasets find that MH-GIN is capable of\nan average 57% reduction in imputation errors compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, while maintaining computational efficiency. The source code and\nimplementation details of MH-GIN are publicly available\nhttps://github.com/hyLiu1994/MH-GIN.",

However, it\ncannot be necessarily attributed to the effectiveness of these evasions, and\nthe limits of engines may also make this unsatisfactory result. In this study,\nwe propose a data-driven approach to measure the effect of app transformations\nto malware detection, and further explain why the detection result is produced\nby these engines. First, we develop an interaction model for antivirus engines,\nillustrating how they respond with different detection results in terms of\nvarying inputs. Six app transformation techniques are implemented in order to\ngenerate a large number of Android apps with traceable changes. Then we\nundertake a one-month tracking of app detection results from multiple antivirus\nengines, through which we obtain over 971K detection reports from VirusTotal\nfor 179K apps in total. Last, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of antivirus\nengines based on these reports from the perspectives of signature-based, static\nanalysis-based, and dynamic analysis-based detection techniques. The results,\ntogether with 7 highlighted findings, identify a number of sealed working\nmechanisms occurring inside antivirus engines and what are the indicators of\ncompromise in apps during malware detection.",

We\nextend biquandle colorings to broken surface diagrams with singular points and\nestablish that coloring sets are in bijection for diagrams related by these\nmoves, yielding a coloring number invariant for immersed surface-links. We\nintroduce singular biquandle 3-cocycles: biquandle 3-cocycles satisfying an\nadditional antisymmetry when the singular relations hold. Using such cocycles,\nwe define a triple-point state-sum with Boltzmann weights and prove its\ninvariance under all generating moves, including (h), thereby obtaining a\nstate-sum invariant for immersed surface-links. The theory is illustrated on\nthe Fenn-Rolfsen link example, where a computation yields non-trivial value,\ndemonstrating nontriviality of the invariant in the immersed setting.

When the two surfaces evolve\nthrough similar dynamics (both Edwards-Wilkinson or both Kardar-Parisi-Zhang),\nthe invariant measure is determined and found to have an inhomogeneous product\nform. This exact steady state is shown to be the measure of the equilibrium\nPoland-Scheraga model of DNA denaturation.",

    "abstract": "Causal discovery from observational data is challenging, especially with\nlarge datasets and complex relationships. Traditional methods often struggle\nwith scalability and capturing global structural information. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based\nprobabilistic framework that learns a probability distribution over the entire\nspace of causal graphs, unlike methods that output a single deterministic\ngraph. Our framework leverages a GNN that encodes both node and edge attributes\ninto a unified graph representation, enabling the model to learn complex causal\nstructures directly from data. The GNN model is trained on a diverse set of\nsynthetic datasets augmented with statistical and information-theoretic\nmeasures, such as mutual information and conditional entropy, capturing both\nlocal and global data properties. We frame causal discovery as a supervised\nlearning problem, directly predicting the entire graph structure. Our approach\ndemonstrates superior performance, outperforming both traditional and recent\nnon-GNN-based methods, as well as a GNN-based approach, in terms of accuracy\nand scalability on synthetic and real-world datasets without further training.\nThis probabilistic framework significantly improves causal structure learning,\nwith broad implications for decision-making and scientific discovery across\nvarious fields.",

A unified\ngrowth law -- independent of a priori assumptions about constitutive relations\nor specified structures of the growth tensor -- remains in fact elusive, as\ndoes an intimate connection between local anisotropic growth, morphogenesis\ndynamics, diffusion phenomena and mechanics. When anisotropy of growth is not\nprescribed arbitrarily, current frameworks mainly attribute shape emergence to\ngrowth-induced global configurational switches, somehow neglecting the\nexistence of local drivers of spontaneous patterning or distorsions also in\nstress-free conditions. To overcome these limitations, in this work we propose\na theoretical approach that reformulates anisotropic growth, remodeling, and\nmorphogenesis starting from first principles, grounded in mass balance. In\nparticular, by positing mass conservation as the sole dynamic constraint for\nthe growth problem, we generalize the mass balance equation to derive evolution\nlaws for mass distribution and geometric reconfiguration. This reveals how mass\ntransport and associated microstructural evolution of the tissue fabric\nsynergistically guide biological, geometric, and constitutive changes of living\nmatter, with the isochoric component of growth orchestrating local anisotropy\nand, at the macroscale, even spontaneous shape development. The proposed fully\ncoupled modelling approach integrates chemo-mechanical and biological\ninteractions inherent to living systems, offering a pathway to investigate\ncomplex scenarios in growth and morphogenesis, redefining the latter in a\nContinuum Mechanics framework. It is felt that this strategy could help to take\na step forward a unified perspective for biomechanical and mechanobiological\nproblems, bridging scales from local drivers to emergent tissue forms and\nshapes.",

However, existing methods often rely on abstracted\nperception or map-based inputs, missing crucial visual context, such as\nfine-grained road cues, accident aftermath, or unexpected obstacles, which are\nessential for robust decision-making in complex driving environments. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose VLMPlanner, a hybrid framework that combines a\nlearning-based real-time planner with a vision-language model (VLM) capable of\nreasoning over raw images. The VLM processes multi-view images to capture rich,\ndetailed visual information and leverages its common-sense reasoning\ncapabilities to guide the real-time planner in generating robust and safe\ntrajectories. Furthermore, we develop the Context-Adaptive Inference Gate\n(CAI-Gate) mechanism that enables the VLM to mimic human driving behavior by\ndynamically adjusting its inference frequency based on scene complexity,\nthereby achieving an optimal balance between planning performance and\ncomputational efficiency. We evaluate our approach on the large-scale,\nchallenging nuPlan benchmark, with comprehensive experimental results\ndemonstrating superior planning performance in scenarios with intricate road\nconditions and dynamic elements.

    "abstract": "T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a symbiotic recurrent nova with eruptions in\n1866 and 1946. Mounting evidence suggests an imminent outburst, offering a rare\nopportunity to observe a nearby nova in detail. We constrain the circumbinary\nmedium (CBM) by modeling inter-eruption radio observations and simulate the\nhydrodynamic evolution of the upcoming outburst to predict its X-ray\nsignatures, focusing on the roles of the red giant companion, accretion disk,\nand equatorial density enhancement (EDE). We model thermal radio emission from\na CBM composed of a spherical wind and a torus-like EDE to estimate its\ndensity. We then perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the nova outburst,\nvarying explosion energy, ejecta mass, and CBM configuration. From these, we\nsynthesize X-ray light curves and spectra as they would appear to XMM-Newton\nand XRISM. The CBM in T CrB is significantly less dense than in other symbiotic\nnovae, with a mass-loss rate of $\\dot{M} \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-9}$ M$_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$ for a 10 km s$^{-1}$ wind. Despite the low-density EDE, the blast is\ncollimated along the poles by the accretion disk and EDE, producing a bipolar\nshock. The red giant partially shields the ejecta, forming a bow shock and hot\nwake. X-ray evolution proceeds through three phases: an early phase (first few\nhours) dominated by shocked disk material; an intermediate phase ($\\sim 1$\nweek-1 month) driven by reverse-shocked ejecta; and a late phase dominated by\nshocked EDE. Soft X-rays trace shocked ejecta, hard X-rays arise from shocked\nambient gas, and synthetic spectra show asymmetric, blueshifted lines due to\nabsorption by expanding ejecta. The X-ray evolution resembles that of RS Oph\nand V745 Sco, with a peak luminosity of $L_\\mathrm{X} \\approx 10^{36}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$, but features a more prolonged soft X-ray phase, reflecting the lower\nCBM density and distinct ejecta-environment interaction.",

The\nscale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in\nparameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize\nthat while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to\nemergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in\nthe activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,\nto circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear\nsubspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various\nmodel scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations\nuniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that\nprojecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace\ncan preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear\nstructures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction\nsignificantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation\nengineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical\ninsights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden\ndimensions. Broadly speaking, our work posits that the high dimensions of a\nmodel's internal representations can be both a blessing and a curse in safety\nalignment.",

    "abstract": "Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer\ngraphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video\ncomposition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains\ndifficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,\nperspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have\nshown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with\nmaintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D\nrendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in\nachieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object\ninsertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,\nwe focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high\ntemporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and\nrefining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure\nrealistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven\npipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,\nreflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To\nmaintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame\nweighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and\n2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for\nrealistic and consistent video editing.

We address this by\nextending the finite mixture of scale mixtures of multivariate skew-normal\n(FMSMSN) family to accommodate incomplete data under a missing at random (MAR)\nmechanism. Unlike previous work that is limited to one of the special cases of\nthe FMSMSN family, our method offers a cluster analysis methodology for the\nentire family that accounts for skewness and excess kurtosis amidst data with\nmissing values. The multivariate skew-normal distribution, as parameterised by\n\\cite{azzalini1996} and \\cite{arnoldbeaver} includes the normal distribution as\na special case, which ensures that our method is flexible toward existing\nsymmetric model-based clustering techniques under a normality assumption.

The simulation experiments showcase the\nflexibility of the FMSMSN family in both clustering performance and parameter\nrecovery for varying percentages of missing values, while incorporating the\neffects of sample size and cluster proximity.

Compared to\nLLMs, the Decision Transformer (DT) is a lightweight generative model applied\nto sequential recommendation tasks. However, DT faces challenges in trajectory\nstitching, often producing suboptimal trajectories. Moreover, due to the high\ndimensionality of user states and the vast state space inherent in\nrecommendation scenarios, DT can incur significant computational costs and\nstruggle to learn effective state representations. To overcome these issues, we\npropose a novel Temporal Advantage Decision Transformer with Contrastive State\nAbstraction (TADT-CSA) model. Specifically, we combine the conventional\nReturn-To-Go (RTG) signal with a novel temporal advantage (TA) signal that\nencourages the model to capture both long-term returns and their sequential\ntrend. Furthermore, we integrate a contrastive state abstraction module into\nthe DT framework to learn more effective and expressive state representations.\nWithin this module, we introduce a TA-conditioned State Vector Quantization\n(TAC-SVQ) strategy, where the TA score guides the state codebooks to\nincorporate contextual token information. Additionally, a reward prediction\nnetwork and a contrastive transition prediction (CTP) network are employed to\nensure the state codebook preserves both the reward information of the current\nstate and the transition information between adjacent states.

Accurate property prediction\nfor polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.\nHowever, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by\nthe constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,\nsince the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,\nwe propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training\nframework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and\nintegrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.\nFrom the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)\nand graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we\ndemonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to\napplying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose\nto further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).\nMoreover, we show the robustness of the \"star linking\" strategy through Repeat\nand Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, \"star linking\"\nstrategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,\na common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)\ntest. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the\ncapability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences.

    "abstract": "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents transformative\nopportunities for education, generating numerous novel application scenarios.\nHowever, significant challenges remain: evaluation metrics vary substantially\nacross different educational scenarios, while many emerging scenarios lack\nappropriate assessment metrics. Current benchmarks predominantly measure\ngeneral intelligence rather than pedagogical capabilities. To address this gap,\nwe introduce ELMES, an open-source automated evaluation framework specifically\ndesigned for assessing LLMs in educational settings. ELMES features a modular\narchitecture that enables researchers to create dynamic, multi-agent dialogues\nthrough simple configuration files, facilitating flexible scenario design\nwithout requiring extensive programming expertise. The framework incorporates a\nhybrid evaluation engine that objectively quantifies traditionally subjective\npedagogical metrics using an LLM-as-a-Judge methodology. We conduct systematic\nbenchmarking of state-of-the-art LLMs across four critical educational\nscenarios: Knowledge Point Explanation, Guided Problem-Solving Teaching,\nInterdisciplinary Lesson Plan Generation, and Contextualized Question\nGeneration, employing fine-grained metrics developed in collaboration with\neducation specialists. Our results demonstrate distinct capability\ndistributions among models, revealing context-specific strengths and\nlimitations. ELMES provides educators and researchers with an accessible\nevaluation framework that significantly reduces adaptation barriers for diverse\neducational applications while advancing the practical implementation of LLMs\nin pedagogy. The framework is publicly available at\n\\emph{https://github.com/sii-research/elmes.git}.",

Many subfields, including quantum\nsimulation of continuous-variable systems, quantum chemistry, and quantum\nmachine learning, rely on the ability to accurately and efficiently prepare\nstates that reflect a Gaussian profile in their probability amplitudes.\nAlthough Gaussian states are natural in continuous-variable systems, the\npractical interest in digital, gate-based quantum computers demands discrete\napproximations of Gaussian distributions over a computational basis of size\n\\(2^n\\). Because of the exponential scaling of naive amplitude-encoding\napproaches and the cost of certain block-encoding or Hamiltonian simulation\ntechniques, a resource-efficient preparation of approximate Gaussian states is\nrequired. In this work, we propose and analyze a circuit-based approach that\nstarts with single-qubit rotations to form an exponential amplitude profile and\nthen applies the quantum Fourier transform to map those amplitudes into an\napproximate Gaussian distribution. We demonstrate that this procedure achieves\nhigh fidelity with the target Gaussian state while allowing optional pruning of\nsmall controlled-phase angles in the quantum Fourier transform, thus reducing\ngate complexity to near-linear in \\(\\mathcal{O}(n)\\).

Parallel programming frameworks\nsuch as OpenMP now offer a variety of advanced scheduling algorithms to support\ndiverse applications and platforms. This creates an instance of the scheduling\nalgorithm selection problem, which involves identifying the most suitable\nalgorithm for a given combination of workload and system characteristics.\n  In this work, we explore learning-based approaches for selecting scheduling\nalgorithms in OpenMP. We propose and evaluate expert-based and reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based methods, and conduct a detailed performance analysis across\nsix applications and three systems. Our results show that RL methods are\ncapable of learning high-performing scheduling decisions, although they require\nsignificant exploration, with the choice of reward function playing a key role.\nExpert-based methods, in contrast, rely on prior knowledge and involve less\nexploration, though they may not always identify the optimal algorithm for a\nspecific application-system pair. By combining expert knowledge with RL-based\nlearning, we achieve improved performance and greater adaptability.\n  Overall, this work demonstrates that dynamic selection of scheduling\nalgorithms during execution is both viable and beneficial for OpenMP\napplications.

To address\nthis critical challenge, we propose a fast and general-purpose framework for\ncross-sensor adaptation, SWIFT (Sensitive Weight Identification for Fast\nTransfer). Specifically, SWIFT employs an unsupervised sampling strategy based\non data manifold structures to balance sample selection while mitigating the\nbias of traditional Farthest Point Sampling, efficiently selecting only 3\\% of\nthe most informative samples from the target domain.

As a\nplug-and-play framework, SWIFT can be applied to various existing pansharpening\nmodels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWIFT reduces the adaptation\ntime from hours to approximately one minute on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.\nThe adapted models not only substantially outperform direct-transfer baselines\nbut also achieve performance competitive with, and in some cases superior to,\nfull retraining, establishing a new state-of-the-art on cross-sensor\npansharpening tasks for the WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.",

It is shown that the pole masses almost remain the\nvacuum values at temperatures far below the critical temperature $T_c$ , and\nthen decrease with the increasing of temperature until a temperature lower than\n$T_c$. This result qualitatively agrees with earlier lattice simulations. While\nthe pole masses increase monotonically above the critical temperature $T_c$,\nwhich agrees with recent lattice calculation. Meanwhile, it is shown that the\nthermal widths increase monotonically with temperature, which also agrees with\nthe near $T_c$ lattice simulations. The screening mass exhibits a similar\ntemperature-dependent behavior to the pole mass, while the dispersion relation\nincreasingly deviates from the relativistic one as the temperature rises.

    "abstract": "A significant fraction (4%-13%) of Antarctic sea ice remains stationary as\nlandfast sea-ice (\"fast ice\"), typically anchored by grounded icebergs. Current\nglobal climate models do not represent fast-ice formation due to iceberg\ngrounding, as iceberg-sea-ice interaction mostly occurs at subgrid scales. We\npropose a novel subgrid-scale coupling mechanism between Lagrangian iceberg\nparticles and an Eulerian sea-ice continuum model. This hybrid\nparticle-continuum approach integrates feedback from icebergs into the sea-ice\nmomentum equation via a Green's function, a Stokeslet, representing the drag\nexerted by a point force on the viscous-plastic medium. The coupled system,\nincluding the Stokeslet induced drag, is discretized using a finite-element\nmethod with piecewise linear basis functions. The approach assumes that\nindividual icebergs have diameters smaller than the grid spacing. The presented\nfinite-element discretization is compatible with existing unstructured-mesh\nocean model frameworks such as FESOM and ICON, ensuring practical applicability\nin Earth system modeling. This work provides and analyzes, for the first time,\na stable numerical framework to capture the effects of individual subgrid-scale\nicebergs on sea-ice dynamics. We derive an a-priori stability estimate bounding\na functional of the sea-ice system and show that the momentum equation\nincluding the subgrid iceberg-sea-ice drag remains stable. Numerical test cases\ndemonstrate the capability of the approach to capture fast-ice formation due to\nsubgrid iceberg grounding on coarse horizontal grids.",

    "abstract": "Gravitational lensing by a stellar microlens of mass $M$ forms two images\nseparated by micro-arcseconds on the sky and has a time delay of\n$2\\times10^{-5}(M/{\\rm M_\\odot})$ seconds. Although we cannot resolve such\nmicro-images in the sky, they could be resolved in time if the source is a fast\nradio burst (FRB). In this work, we study the magnification ($|\\mu|$) and time\ndelay~($t_d$) distributions of micro-images led by different microlens\npopulations. We find that, in microlensing of typical strongly lensed\n(macro-)images in galaxy lenses, micro-images stemmed from a population of\nstellar mass microlenses in the $[0.08, 1.5]\\:{\\rm M_\\odot}$ range and a second\n(dark) microlens population in $[10^{-3} - 10^{-2}]\\:{\\rm M_\\odot}$ range\nreside in different parts of $|\\mu|-t_d$ plane. For the global minimum\nmacro-image, due to low stellar mass density, we find that the stellar\npopulation leads to peaks in autocorrelation at ${>}10^{-6}$ seconds, whereas\nthe secondary population leads to peaks at ${<}10^{-6}$ seconds, allowing us to\ndifferentiate different microlens populations. However, an increase in stellar\ndensity introduces new peaks at ${<}10^{-6}$ seconds, which can pollute the\ninference about the presence of multiple microlens populations. In addition, we\nalso show that the number of micro-images, hence the number of peaks in the\nautocorrelation, is also sensitive to the underlying stellar mass function,\nallowing us to constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) with FRB\nmicrolesning in the future. This work is a first step towards using FRB lensing\nto probe the microlens population within strong lenses, and more detailed\nstudies are required to assess the effect of various uncertainties that we only\ndiscussed qualitatively.",

    "abstract": "We propose a framework based on Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization\n(QUBO) for generating plausible ligand binding poses within protein pockets,\nenabling efficient structure-based virtual screening. The method discretizes\nthe binding site into a grid and solves a QUBO problem to select spatially\ndistributed, energetically favorable grid points. Each ligand is represented by\na three-atom geometric contour, which is aligned to the selected grid points\nthrough rigid-body transformation, producing from hundreds to hundreds of\nthousands of candidate poses. Using a benchmark of 169 protein-ligand\ncomplexes, we generated an average of 110 to 600000 poses per ligand, depending\non QUBO parameters and matching thresholds. Evaluation against crystallographic\nstructures revealed that a larger number of candidates increases the likelihood\nof recovering near-native poses, with recovery rates reaching 100 percent for\nroot mean square deviation (RMSD) values below 1.0 angstrom and 95.9 percent\nfor RMSD values below 0.6 angstrom. Since the correct binding pose is not known\nin advance, we apply AutoDock-based scoring to select the most plausible\ncandidates from the generated pool, achieving recovery rates of up to 82.8\npercent for RMSD < 2.0 angstrom, 81.7 percent for RMSD < 1.5 angstrom, and 75.2\npercent for RMSD < 1.0 angstrom. When poses with misleading scores are\nexcluded, performance improves further, with recovery rates reaching up to 97.8\npercent for RMSD < 2.0 angstrom and 1.5 angstrom, and 95.4 percent for RMSD <\n1.0 angstrom.

This paper\npresents two core contributions to advancing DA-MSA translation for the\nLevantine, Egyptian, and Gulf dialects, particularly in low-resource and\ncomputationally constrained settings: (i) a comprehensive evaluation of\ntraining-free prompting techniques, and (ii) the development of a\nresource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline. Our evaluation of prompting strategies\nacross six large language models (LLMs) found that few-shot prompting\nconsistently outperformed zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and our proposed\nAra-TEaR method. Ara-TEaR is designed as a three-stage self-refinement\nprompting process, targeting frequent meaning-transfer and adaptation errors in\nDA-MSA translation. In this evaluation, GPT-4o achieved the highest performance\nacross all prompting settings. For fine-tuning LLMs, a quantized Gemma2-9B\nmodel achieved a chrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58).\nJoint multi-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by\nover 10% chrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less\nthan 1% performance loss.

    "abstract": "We compare halo mass estimates from three galaxy group catalogs (redMaPPer,\nYang21, and Zou21) with those derived from gravitational lensing measurements.\nEach catalog employs distinct methodologies, including mass-richness relations,\nabundance matching, and luminosity-based calibration. A linear correlation is\nobserved between catalog-estimated and lensing-derived masses. The redMaPPer\ncatalog shows the best agreement, especially for lower-redshift groups, with\nminor deviations in higher-redshift bins. Yang21 is the only catalog containing\nlow mass groups, which gives a reasonably good mass estimation, except for the\nlowest mass bin. Cross-matched groups between redMaPPer and Yang21 reveal the\nformer catalog provides more accurate mass estimation, while the Yang21 makes\nunder-estimation of halo mass for those sharing the central galaxy with\nredMaPPer and over-estimation of halo mass for those with different center\ndetermination with redMaPPer and for the unique Yang21 groups. These findings\nemphasize the importance of redshift-dependent calibration and refined group\ndefinitions for accurate mass estimation.",

However, one\ncritical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine\nstructures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive\nresolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\\times$ downsampling) in the SD model.\nOne solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion;\nhowever, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while\nmitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address\nthese issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the\n8$\\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\\times$ one while adapting to the\npre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\\times$ decoder based on the\noutput features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\\times$ encoder\nwhile keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the\nnew encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing\nimage fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and\ncompute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the\ncomputational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves\nfine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based\nmethods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion\nmodels.

We observe similar environmentally induced Stark shifts for both the\nneutral exciton and negatively charged trion transitions, while the positively\nand doubly negatively charged trions exhibit significant differences. Our\ninvestigation quantifies the underlying impurity charge dynamics over a range\nfrom well below milliseconds to seconds, revealing that the hole occupation of\nthe positively charged trion transition is constrained by rapid hole loss and\nslow hole recapture dynamics. Utilizing a second non-resonant laser, we\nincrease the hole occupancy by over an order of magnitude and identify both a\nprolonged hole residence time and an enhanced hole tunneling rate into the\nquantum dot.

Extreme\nMJO events are defined as those exceeding a specific threshold based on the\nevents distribution, distinguishing them from weak events. Our analysis shows\nthat extreme MJO events most frequently initiate in phases 2-3 throughout the\nyear, with similar distributions across phases 8-1, 6-7, and 4-5. This\ndistribution is also characteristic of winter, while in summer, initiation is\nmore balanced between phases 2-3 and 8-1. In contrast, weak events\npredominantly start in phases 4-5 year-round, followed by phases 2-3, with\nphases 8-1 and 6-7 occurring at similar frequencies. Seasonally, weak event\ninitiation prevails in phases 4-5 during summer, while in winter, it is evenly\ndistributed between phases 8-1 and 4-5. Additionally, during La Ni\\~na, extreme\nevents tend to last longer than during El Ni\\~no, a pattern not observed in\nweak events. A composite analysis of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), eddy\nstreamfunction, and velocity potential was conducted, with particular focus on\nthe initiation phases 2-3 and 6-7 to determine which phases result in the most\nsignificant impacts and how the associated anomalies evolve. The findings show\nthat enhanced (suppressed) convection centers in the equatorial region during\nextreme events are more intense and exhibit a southeastern displacement\ncompared to those during weak events. These extreme MJO events influence the\nSouth American rainfall Dipole (SAD), a key feature of regional climate\nvariability and results show that extreme MJO events induce more intense\nrainfall anomalies of larger spatial extent compared to weak events.",

The $\\gamma$-pocket formed by the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band, which was\npreviously proposed to be crucial in the pairing mechanism of pressurized bulk\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, is reported to be either present or absent here by different\nexperimental groups, giving rise to the problem: what is the pairing mechanism\nand pairing nature without the $\\gamma$-pocket? Here, we start from a band\nstructure obtained via density-functional-theoretical calculation, which\nexhibits no $\\gamma$-pocket. Then, equipped with electron interactions, we\nstudy the pairing nature via combined weak- and strong- coupling approaches,\nwhich provide consistent results. In the weak-coupling study, the nesting\nbetween the $\\alpha$- and $\\beta$- pockets leads to an $s^\\pm$-wave pairing in\nwhich the gap signs on the two pockets are opposite, as provided by our\nrandom-phase-approximation based calculations. In real-space, the pairing\npattern is dominated by the interlayer pairing of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. In\nthe strong-coupling study, as the $d_{z^2}$ orbitals are nearly half-filled and\nhence localized, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals carry the HTSC. Driven by the\ninterlayer superexchange transferred from the $d_{z^2}$ orbital through the\nHund's rule coupling, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital electrons form interlayer\n$s$-wave pairing, as suggested by our slave-boson-mean-field study on the\nrelated two-orbital $t$-$J$ model. Projected onto the Fermi surface, this\npairing just gives the $s^\\pm$-wave pattern consistent with that obtained in\nthe weak-coupling study.

To address\ninter- and intra-operator variability, robotic ultrasound systems have gained\nincreasing attention. However, their application in challenging intercostal\nimaging remains limited due to the lack of an effective scan path generation\nmethod within the constrained acoustic window. To overcome this challenge, we\nexplore the potential of tactile cues for characterizing subcutaneous rib\nstructures as an alternative signal for ultrasound segmentation-free bone\nsurface point cloud extraction. Compared to 2D US images, 1D tactile-related\nsignals offer higher processing efficiency and are less susceptible to acoustic\nnoise and artifacts. By leveraging robotic tracking data, a sparse tactile\npoint cloud is generated through a few scans along the rib, mimicking human\npalpation. To robustly map the scanning trajectory into the intercostal space,\nthe sparse tactile bone location point cloud is first interpolated to form a\ndenser representation. This refined point cloud is then registered to an\nimage-based dense bone surface point cloud, enabling accurate scan path mapping\nfor individual patients. Additionally, to ensure full coverage of the object of\ninterest, we introduce an automated tilt angle adjustment method to visualize\nstructures beneath the bone.

Existing approaches either convert EF into scalar rewards, losing\nrich contextual information, or employ refinement datasets, failing to exploit\nthe multi-step and discrete nature of EF interactions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose MoL-RL, a novel training paradigm that integrates\nmulti-step EF signals into LLMs through a dual-objective optimization\nframework. Our method combines MoL (Mixture-of-Losses) continual training,\nwhich decouples domain-specific EF signals (optimized via cross-entropy loss)\nand general language capabilities (preserved via Kullback-Leibler divergence),\nwith GRPO-based post-training to distill sequential EF interactions into\nsingle-step inferences. This synergy enables robust feedback-independent\nreasoning without relying on external feedback loops. Experimental results on\nmathematical reasoning (MATH-500, AIME24/AIME25) and code generation\n(CodeAgent-Test) benchmarks demonstrate that MoL-RL achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with the Qwen3-8B model, while maintaining strong generalization\nacross model scales (Qwen3-4B).

Traditional PLVMs rely on joint distributions to model complex data,\nbut introducing latent variables results in an ill-posed parameter learning\nproblem. To address this issue, regularization terms are typically introduced,\nleading to the development of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm,\nwhere the latent variable distribution is restricted to a predefined normalized\ndistribution family to facilitate the expectation step. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose representing the latent variable distribution as a\nfinite set of instances perturbed via an ordinary differential equation with a\ncontrol policy. This approach ensures that the instances asymptotically\nconverge to the true latent variable distribution as time approaches infinity.\nBy doing so, we reformulate the distribution inference problem as an optimal\ncontrol policy determination problem, relaxing the model specification to an\ninfinite-horizon path space. Building on this formulation, we derive the\ncorresponding optimal control policy using the Pontryagin's maximum principle\nand provide a closed-form expression for its implementation using the\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space. After that, we develop a novel,\nconvergence-guaranteed EM algorithm for PLVMs based on this\ninfinite-horizon-optimal-control-based inference strategy. Finally, extensive\nexperiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the\nproposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative content generation (CCG) enables collective creation of\nartifacts like scientific articles. Quality is a paramount concern in CCG, and\na multitude of methods have been proposed to evaluate the quality of artifacts.\nNevertheless, the majority of these methods are reliant on centralized\narchitectures, which present challenges pertaining to security, privacy, and\navailability. Blockchain technology proffers a potential resolution to these\nchallenges, by furnishing a decentralized and immutable ledger of quality\nscores. In this manuscript, we introduce a blockchain-based quality control\nmodel for CCG that uses a semi-iterative algorithm to interdependently compute\nquality scores of artifacts and reputation of nodes. Our model addresses\ncritical challenges in academic informetrics, such as citation manipulation,\ntransparency in collaborative scholarship, and decentralized trust in metric\ncomputation. Our model also exhibits sensitivity to processing latency,\nrendering it more agile in the presence of delays. Our model's quality scores,\nevaluated against PageRank and HITS baselines, show comparable performance,\nwith additional assessments of throughput, latency, and robustness against\nmalicious nodes confirming its reliability. A theoretical comparison with\nrecent studies validates its feasibility for real world informetric\napplication.",

    "abstract": "Shaping inclusive representations that embrace diversity and ensure fair\nparticipation and reflections of values is at the core of many\nconversation-based models. However, many existing methods rely on surface\ninclusion using mention of user demographics or behavioral attributes of social\ngroups. Such methods overlook the nuanced, implicit expression of opinion\nembedded in conversations. Furthermore, the over-reliance on overt cues can\nexacerbate misalignment and reinforce harmful or stereotypical representations\nin model outputs. Thus, we took a step back and recognized that equitable\ninclusion needs to account for the implicit expression of opinion and use the\nstance of responses to validate the normative alignment. This study aims to\nevaluate how opinions are represented in NLP or computational models by\nintroducing an alignment evaluation framework that foregrounds implicit, often\noverlooked conversations and evaluates the normative social views and\ndiscourse. Our approach models the stance of responses as a proxy for the\nunderlying opinion, enabling a considerate and reflective representation of\ndiverse social viewpoints. We evaluate the framework using both (i)\npositive-unlabeled (PU) online learning with base classifiers, and (ii)\ninstruction-tuned language models to assess post-training alignment. Through\nthis, we provide a lens on how implicit opinions are (mis)represented and offer\na pathway toward more inclusive model behavior.",

This inefficiency limits\nthe exploration of the vast symbolic search space and destabilizes the training\nprocess. To address this, Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS), a novel\nreward shaping method, is proposed. TLRS provides dense, intermediate rewards\nby measuring the subsequence-level similarity between partially generated\nexpressions and a set of expert-designed formulas. Furthermore, a reward\ncentering mechanism is introduced to reduce training variance. Extensive\nexperiments on six major Chinese and U.S. stock indices show that TLRS\nsignificantly improves the predictive power of mined factors, boosting the Rank\nInformation Coefficient by 9.29% over existing potential-based shaping\nalgorithms.

    "abstract": "Upcoming stage 4 surveys, such as the Simons Observatory, LSST, and Euclid,\nare poised to measure weak gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) and galaxies with unprecedented precision. While the power\nspectrum is the standard statistic used to analyze weak lensing data,\nnon-Gaussianity from non-linear structure growth encodes additional\ncosmological information in higher-order statistics. We forecast the ability of\nfuture surveys to constrain cosmological parameters using the weak lensing\npower spectrum and bispectrum from both CMB and galaxy surveys, including their\ncross-correlations. We consider an eight-parameter model ($\\Lambda$CDM + $\\sum\nm_\\nu$ + $w_0$) and assess constraints for stage 4 survey specifications. In\nthe absence of systematics, both the CMB and galaxy lensing bispectra are found\nto be detectable at high signal-to-noise. We test two priors: a ''strong'' one\nbased on constraints from CMB temperature and $E$-mode polarization\nanisotropies, and a ''weak'' one with minimal assumptions. With the weak prior,\nthe bispectrum significantly improves parameter constraints by breaking\ndegeneracies. For strong priors, improvements are more limited, especially for\nthe CMB bispectrum. On small scales, where non-linear effects dominate, the\nbispectrum's constraining power can rival that of the power spectrum. We also\nfind strong synergy between CMB and galaxy lensing; combining both probes leads\nto tighter constraints, particularly on neutrino mass. It was recently found\nthat the CMB lensing bispectrum is strongly affected by the Born approximation,\nso we also consider post-Born corrections but find that our main conclusions\nremain the same. These results highlight the potential of higher-order lensing\nstatistics and motivate further work on neglected effects such as non-Gaussian\ncovariance, instrumental systematics, and baryonic feedback.",

However, due to technical and feasibility\nconstraints in their practical implementations, especially within non routine\nmanufacturing processes, task based approach to ergonomic assessment is\nutilized. Despite enabling operationalization of robust ergonomic assessment\ntechnologies within complicated industrial processes, task based approach\nraises several validity concerns. Hence, to ascertain functional utility of the\nresultant safety interventions, this study evaluates the construct validity of\ntask based ergonomic assessment within non routine work utilizing Multitrait\nmultimethod (MTMM) matrix followed by video-based content analysis. Ergonomic\nexposure traits were collected for 46 participants through direct measurement\nand self reported techniques utilizing inertial motion capture and Borg's RPE\nrating scale respectively.

Maximizing multi-messenger constraints on these systems requires\ncombining models of the progenitors and products of BNS mergers within a single\nframework in anticipation of future GW and EM detectors. We demonstrate how\ncombining models of different aspects of the BNS progenitor-merger-remnant\nsystem into a full multi-messenger modeling pipeline reveals insight into\nmodeling challenges that will need to be addressed in the coming decade of\nmulti-messenger astronomy. Motivated by GW170817, this combined model relates\nthe progenitor astrophysics of a BNS population with their GW observability and\nlocalizability, kilonova light curves, gamma-ray burst afterglow flux, and\nkilonova remnant evolution. We find joint correlations between the GW and EM\nobservables that depend on a complicated interplay between modeling assumptions\nand theoretical uncertainties. Next generation detectors will generically\nprovide multi-messenger constraints on BNSs with median GW network\nsignal-to-noise ratio $\\approx 10$, median of the 90$^{\\rm th}$ percentile sky\narea $\\approx 10$ sq. deg., and kilonova $i$-band apparent magnitudes ranging\nfrom $\\approx 33$ to $23$.

We consider\nscenarios with negative and positive triangularity plasma shaping taken from\nexisting tokamaks (TCV, DIII-D, MAST-U and SMART) and EU-DEMO. The study of all\nthese tokamaks reveals a coherent picture. Negative triangularity geometry is\nmore susceptible to micro-tearing modes (MTM), which, when present, make\ntransport much worse than in positive triangularity. At sufficiently large\n$\\beta$ (the ratio of plasma pressure over magnetic pressure), magnetic shear\nand ratio of electron to ion temperature gradient, all the scenarios with\nnegative triangularity are dominated by MTM turbulence. In contrast, the\ncorresponding scenarios with positive triangularity remain dominated by\nelectrostatic turbulence and MTMs are subdominant or stable. We observe that\nconventional tokamaks usually operate in a parameter space far away from the\nonset of this MTM-dominated regime in negative triangularity, thus preserving\nthe beneficial effect of negative triangularity on turbulent transport. In\ncontrast, spherical tokamaks operate close to this regime and may ultimately\nexhibit worse transport at negative triangularity than positive triangularity.\nWe find that lowering the magnetic shear in spherical tokamaks can preserve the\nbeneficial effect of negative triangularity on electrostatic turbulence and\nprevent strong MTM transport. Finally, linear and nonlinear simulations reveal\nthe reason for stronger MTMs: the magnetic drifts are faster in the negative\ntriangularity geometry.",

This study\nfuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene\nclassification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification\nlies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By\nextracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively\nreflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of\nthe holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion\nmodel utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into\na set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1)\nMulti-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale\nfeatures to generate global channel attention features for small-scale\nfeatures, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2)\nLocal Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention\nweights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets,\nensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area\nare effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to\nfine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It\nfuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene\ninformation. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and\nclassify complex mining landscapes.

As an important tool for studying\ncomplex systems, computational experiments can map them into artificial society\nmodels that are computable and reproducible within computers, thereby providing\ndigital and computational methods for quantitative analysis. In current\nresearch, the construction of individual agent models often ignores the\nlong-term accumulative effect of memory mechanisms in the development process\nof agents, which to some extent causes the constructed models to deviate from\nthe real characteristics of real-world systems. To address this challenge, this\npaper proposes an individual agent model based on a memory-learning\ncollaboration mechanism, which implements hierarchical modeling of the memory\nmechanism and a multi-indicator evaluation mechanism. Through hierarchical\nmodeling of the individual memory repository, the group memory repository, and\nthe memory buffer pool, memory can be effectively managed, and knowledge\nsharing and dissemination between individuals and groups can be promoted. At\nthe same time, the multi-indicator evaluation mechanism enables dynamic\nevaluation of memory information, allowing dynamic updates of information in\nthe memory set and promoting collaborative decision-making between memory and\nlearning. Experimental results show that, compared with existing memory\nmodeling methods, the agents constructed by the proposed model demonstrate\nbetter decision-making quality and adaptability within the system.

These are\nconfigurations familiar in the Casimir-Polder effect, but the behavior of\natom-surface entanglement is quite different from the well-studied behavior of\nfield-induced forces. For one, while the attractive force between an atom and a\nconducting surface increases as they come closer, the entanglement between the\natom and the quantum field actually decreases as the atom gets closer to the\nconductor, as shown in \\cite{Rong,AFD2}. We show how different factors play\nout, ranging from the coupling between the atoms and the field to the coupling\nbetween the atoms, going beyond the weak coupling restrictions often found\nnecessary in the literature. Gathering our results for the entanglement\ndependence on each variable concerned, we can provide a spatial topography of\nquantum entanglement, thus enabling a visualized understanding of the behavior\nof quantum field-mediated entanglement. In particular we can quantify the\ndefinition of a three-dimensional \\textit{entanglement domain} between the two\natoms, how it varies with their coupling, their separation and their distances\nfrom the conducting surface, and for practical applications, how to exercise\neffective control of the entanglement between two atoms by changing these\nparameters.

    "abstract": "Partial domain adaptation (PDA) is a challenging task in real-world machine\nlearning scenarios. It aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain\nto a related unlabeled target domain, where the support set of the source label\ndistribution subsumes the target one. Previous PDA works managed to correct the\nlabel distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,\nthe simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and\nsufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on\nthe source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based\nshift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a\nbuilt sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as\nthe target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of the model. We provide theoretical guarantees for\nIS$^2$C by proving that the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated\nby IS$^2$C. In particular, by implementing sampling with the mixture\ndistribution, the extent of shift between source and sampling domains can be\nconnected to generalization error, which provides an interpretable way to build\nIS$^2$C. To improve knowledge transfer, an optimal transport-based independence\ncriterion is proposed for conditional distribution alignment, where the\ncomputation of the criterion can be adjusted to reduce the complexity from\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in realistic PDA scenarios. Extensive\nexperiments on PDA benchmarks validate the theoretical results and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our IS$^2$C over existing methods.",

In this work, we evaluate the\nreliability of these diagnostics, specifically those used to recover the star\nformation rate (SFR), the ionising photon production efficiency, and the\ngas-phase oxygen abundance. We use forward-modelled galaxy spectra from\nidealised toy models and the FLARES cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to\nassess how these diagnostic lines respond to variations in the underlying\nstellar populations and star-dust geometry. We find that due to the clumpy\nnature of FLARES galaxies, they exhibit strong internal variation in age,\nmetallicity and dust attenuation, biasing the interpretation using these\ndiagnostics. In FLARES, the SFRD at the bright-end of the SFR function can be\nunderestimated by as much as $30 \\%$ compared to the true values. Similarly,\nthe true ionising photon production efficiency in FLARES remains almost\nconstant with stellar mass, while estimates using H$\\alpha$ or H$\\beta$ can\nunderestimate it by more than 0.5 dex at the massive end ($>10^{9.5}$\nM$_{\\odot}$), introducing an artificial declining trend. The FLARES\nmass-metallicity relation derived from line ratios (dust corrected) exhibits a\nflat trend, whereas the intrinsic mass-weighted relation shows a strong\npositive correlation. These findings highlight the critical importance of\nunderstanding the biases introduced due to the coupling of star-dust geometry\nand heterogeneous stellar population when interpreting nebular emission lines\nat high redshift. Hence the accurate interpretation of high-redshift galaxy\nspectra requires careful forward modelling that accounts for realistic\nstar-dust geometry and population variations.",

Existing methods\ntypically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks\nand leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.\nHowever, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due\nto constraints in their feature extraction techniques.

However, self-heating due to AC loss or\nDC short circuits can cause electro-thermal quench, which poses a significant\nchallenge for the design and reliability of superconducting motors. Here, we\napply an electro-magneto-thermal computational approach that integrates the\nMinimum Electro-Magnetic Entropy Production (MEMEP) method for electromagnetic\nmodelling with the Finite Difference Method (FDM) for electrothermal analyses.\nThe investigation focuses on the response of an HTS racetrack coil subjected to\nDC voltages ranging from low (1 V) to high values (1000 V) at operating\ntemperature of 30 K. Computations were conducted under two thermal boundary\nconditions: complete adiabatic conditions and cooling applied to one side of\nthe coil with the top surface at 30 K. We found that at higher voltages, the\ncurrent exceeds the critical value, causing rapid thermal runaway that damages\nthe superconducting material. In contrast, at lower voltages, the coil presents\nperiodic oscillations in current and temperature, demonstrating a complex\ninterplay of thermal diffusion and electromagnetic stability. This study\nprovides critical insights into the thermal management and fault response of\nHTS coils for aviation applications, particularly in the design of\nsuperconducting motors for electric aircraft.",

This work\nestablishes, for the first time, a fundamental theoretical framework for\ntopological chirality-induced spin selectivity (TCISS) in trefoil knot\nmolecules and identifies the necessary conditions for knot-driven spin\nselectivity. Our calculation results reveal that a trefoil knot molecule can\nexhibit spin polarization exceeding 60% along with significant conductivity.\nNotably, neither reducing the lattice number nor applying strain regulation\nsignificantly diminishes this ultra-high spin polarization, highlighting its\nrobustness. Importantly, when the topological knot degenerates into a trivial\nstructure, accompanied by the transition from topological chirality to\nstructural chirality, the spin polarization sharply declines, demonstrating a\nstrong correlation between the ultrahigh spin polarization and the knot\ntopology. Our theory not only successfully elucidates the physical mechanism of\nTCISS, but also uncovers a new spin-polarized transport phenomenon termed\nknot-driven spin selectivity, offering new guiding principles for designing\nnonmagnetic materials for spintronics device applications.",

Remarkably, the Miles mode, characterized by a sharp jump in\ninviscid Reynolds stress (tau) at the critical layer, persists up to delta =\n0.01, i.e., ten times the air water value. As delta increases, the vertical\nvariation of tau undergoes a qualitative change, from a sharp jump at the\ncritical layer for delta much less than 1 to a smooth transition through it for\ndelta greater than or equal to 0.5. A theoretical explanation is provided. In\nthe moderate to high density ratio regime, comparison with a piecewise-linear\n(PL) velocity profile confirms the presence of both H and KH instabilities in\nthe exponential profile.

At delta = 0.1, waves saturate\ninto finite-amplitude structures with capillary ripples, while at delta = 0.5,\nthe waves develop sheared cusps and emit spume, resembling asymmetric Holmboe\nwaves observed experimentally. At delta = 0.9, the waves rapidly evolve into\nclassic KH spirals. Comparisons with the PL profile highlight the role of\nbackground curvature and the critical layer. This work presents, for the first\ntime, all three canonical instabilities within a single background state.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the influence of the dimensionless electric charge\n($Q/M$), magnetic charge ($P/M$), and Taub-NUT parameter ($n/M$) of a dyonic\nKerr-Newman-Kasuya-Taub-NUT black hole on quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs)\nobserved in X-ray binaries. Using the relativistic precession model, we\ncalculate the three fundamental frequencies arising from particle motion in the\naccretion disk around the black hole. These theoretical predictions are then\nconfronted with observational QPO data from five X-ray binaries (GRO J1655-40,\nXTE J1859$+$226, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1915$+$105, and H1743-322), and the Markov\nChain Monte Carlo technique is used to constrain the black hole parameters. Our\nanalysis reveals no significant evidence for nonzero values of $Q/M$ and $P/M$\nacross all sources, thereby allowing us to place several stringent upper limits\non electric charge ($Q/M$) and magnetic charge ($P/M$) of the black hole in\nthese systems. Similarly, no compelling indication of a nonzero Taub-NUT\nparameter is found in QPOs from GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859$+$226, XTE J1550-564,\nand H1743-322. In contrast, the posterior distribution derived from GRS\n1915$+$105 data suggests a nonzero Taub-NUT parameter, i.e., gravitomagnetic\nmonopole moment. This result indicates a potential deviation from the Kerr\nmetric in this astrophysical black hole.",

    "abstract": "The architecture of a neural network (NN) plays a critical role in\ndetermining its performance. However, there is no general closed-form function\nthat maps between network structure and accuracy, making the process of\narchitecture design largely heuristic or search-based. In this study, we\npropose the Architecture Suggesting Neural Network (ASNN), a model designed to\nlearn the relationship between NN architecture and its test accuracy, and to\nsuggest improved architectures accordingly. To train ASNN, we constructed\ndatasets using TensorFlow-based models with varying numbers of layers and\nnodes. Experimental results were collected for both 2-layer and 3-layer\narchitectures across a grid of configurations, each evaluated with 10 repeated\ntrials to account for stochasticity. Accuracy values were treated as inputs,\nand architectural parameters as outputs. The trained ASNN was then used\niteratively to predict architectures that yield higher performance. In both\n2-layer and 3-layer cases, ASNN successfully suggested architectures that\noutperformed the best results found in the original training data. Repeated\nprediction and retraining cycles led to the discovery of architectures with\nimproved mean test accuracies, demonstrating the model's capacity to generalize\nthe performance-structure relationship. These results suggest that ASNN\nprovides an efficient alternative to random search for architecture\noptimization, and offers a promising approach toward automating neural network\ndesign. \"Parts of the manuscript, including text editing and expression\nrefinement, were supported by OpenAI's ChatGPT.

    "abstract": "Existing sports video captioning methods often focus on the action yet\noverlook player identities, limiting their applicability. Although some methods\nintegrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player\nidentities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent\nof the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt\ngeneration network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which\nfocuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.\nSpecifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is\ndesigned to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a\nplayer identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player\nnames, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player\nfeatures with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual\ncontext learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context\ninformation. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the\nmultimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the\ngeneration of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we\nconstruct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware\nbasketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event\ntypes.

The novelty of the model lies in the combination of a\nHawkes-type dependency from past events, as well as a latent variable that\nencodes changes in bat behavior.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of\nlarge language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). However, it often produces\nbrittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious\nreasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the\ntrustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified\ntheoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.\nThis paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the\nstability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show\nthat policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common\noccurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This\ntheoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly\ndisparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards\nthat may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action\ndegeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting\nto the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how\nstability is governed by an \"effective reward\" aggregation mechanism. We also\nprove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of\nincreased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for\nrecent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following\ntrade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through\nperturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances\npolicy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled\ntheory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "The dynamical evolution of the surface height is controlled by\n  either a linear or a nonlinear Langevin equation, depending on the\n  underlying microscopic dynamics, and is often done theoretically\n  using stochastic coarse-grained growth equations. The persistence\n  probability $p(t)$ of stochastic models of surface growth that are\n  constrained by a finite system size is examined in this work. We\n  focus on the linear Edwards-Wilkinson model (EW) and the nonlinear\n  Kardar-Parisi-Zhang model, two specific models of surface\n  growth. The persistence exponents in the continuum version of these\n  two models have been widely investigated. Krug et al.[Phys. Rev. E ,\n  56:2702-2712, (1997)] and Kallabis et al. [EPL (Europhysics Letters)\n  , 45(1):20, 1999] had shown that, the steady-state persistence\n  exponents for both these models are related to the growth exponent\n  $\\beta$ as $\\theta=1-\\beta$. It is numerically found that the values\n  of persistence exponents for both these models are close to the\n  analytically predicted values. While the results of the continuum\n  equations of the surface growth are well known, we focus to study\n  the persistence probability expressions for discrete models with a\n  finite size effect. In this article, we have investigated the\n  persistence probabilities for the linear Edwards-Wilkinson(EW) model\n  and for the non-linear Kardar-Parisi-Zhang(KPZ) model of surface\n  growth on a finite one-dimensional lattice. The interesting\n  phenomenon which is found in this case is that the known scenario of\n  $p(t)$ of the following algebraic decay vanishes as we introduce a\n  finite system size.",

Currently, the most popular and high-performing SBR methods primarily\nleverage graph neural networks (GNNs), which model session sequences as\ngraph-structured data to effectively capture user intent. However, most\nGNNs-based SBR methods primarily focus on modeling the ID sequence information\nof session sequences, while neglecting the rich semantic information embedded\nwithin them. This limitation significantly hampers model's ability to\naccurately infer users' true intention. To address above challenge, this paper\nproposes a novel SBR approach called Integrating LLM-Derived Multi-Semantic\nIntent into Graph Model for Session-based Recommendation (LLM-DMsRec). The\nmethod utilizes a pre-trained GNN model to select the top-k items as candidate\nitem sets and designs prompts along with a large language model (LLM) to infer\nmulti-semantic intents from these candidate items. Specifically, we propose an\nalignment mechanism that effectively integrates the semantic intent inferred by\nthe LLM with the structural intent captured by GNNs.

To address this problem,\nwe propose a novel value-based method, named Concepts learning for Multi-agent\nQ-learning (CMQ), that goes beyond the current performance-vs-interpretability\ntrade-off by learning interpretable cooperation concepts. CMQ represents each\ncooperation concept as a supervised vector, as opposed to existing models where\nthe information flowing through their end-to-end mechanism is concept-agnostic.\nIntuitively, using individual action value conditioning on global state\nembeddings to represent each concept allows for extra cooperation\nrepresentation capacity.

    "abstract": "Scaling laws are fundamental mathematical relationships that predict how\nneural network performance evolves with changes in variables such as model\nsize, dataset size, and computational resources. Traditionally, discovering\nthese laws requires extensive human expertise and manual experimentation. We\nintroduce EvoSLD, an automated framework for Scaling Law Discovery (SLD) that\nleverages evolutionary algorithms guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nco-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines. Formulated to\nhandle scaling variables, control variables, and response metrics across\ndiverse experimental settings, EvoSLD searches for parsimonious, universal\nfunctional forms that minimize fitting errors on grouped data subsets.\nEvaluated on five real-world scenarios from recent literature, EvoSLD\nrediscovers exact human-derived laws in two cases and surpasses them in others,\nachieving up to orders-of-magnitude reductions in normalized mean squared error\non held-out test sets. Compared to baselines like symbolic regression and\nablated variants, EvoSLD demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and\nefficiency, highlighting its potential to accelerate AI research.

    "abstract": "The prediction quality of machine learnt models and the functionality they\nultimately enable (e.g., object detection), is typically evaluated using a\nvariety of quantitative metrics that are specified in the associated model\nperformance requirements. When integrating such models into aeronautical\napplications, a top-down safety assessment process must influence both the\nmodel performance metrics selected, and their acceptable range of values.\nOften, however, the relationship of system safety objectives to model\nperformance requirements and the associated metrics is unclear. Using an\nexample of an aircraft emergency braking system containing a machine learnt\ncomponent (MLC) responsible for object detection and alerting, this paper first\ndescribes a simple abstraction of the required MLC behavior. Then, based on\nthat abstraction, an initial method is given to derive the minimum\nsafety-related performance requirements, the associated metrics, and their\ntargets for the both MLC and its underlying deep neural network, such that they\nmeet the quantitative safety objectives obtained from the safety assessment\nprocess. We give rationale as to why the proposed method should be considered\nvalid, also clarifying the assumptions made, the constraints on applicability,\nand the implications for verification.",

    "abstract": "The gauge field theory of the standard electroweak model in the presence of\nthe electroweak bubble wall is investigated with an eye toward its applications\nto microscopic phenomena, which are supposed to have occurred during the phase\ntransition in the early universe. The asymptotic fields are defined anew so\nthat the effects of the position-dependent Higgs condensate are taken into\naccount through the position-dependent $W$ and $Z$ boson masses. A novel method\nof massive gauge field quantization in the $R_{\\xi}$-gauge with $\\xi =1$ is\nproposed for the case of the position-dependent masses. Our procedure is based\non the eigenfunction expansion method associated with second-order differential\noperators, i.e., a sort of generalized Fourier expansion.The commutation\nrelations of creation and annihilation operators of various wave propagation\nmodes are given in terms of the so-called spectral function. The decoupling of\nunphysical states from the physical S-matrix is also investigated along the\nline of Kugo-Ojima's quartet mechanism on the basis of the BRST symmetry. It is\npointed out that one of the quartet fields is not merely the unphysical scalar\nfield but should be a linear combination of the unphysical scalar and the gauge\nfields. The physical and unphysical polarizations of the gauge field waves are\nunambiguously distinguished and this will help us evaluate the friction caused\nby the physical polarization states of $W$ and $Z$ boson waves on the bubble\nwall during the phase transition in the early universe.",

We propose Maximum a\nPosteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from\npreferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the\noptimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum\nLikelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating\nprior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective.\nThis not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by\nmitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More\nimportantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports\npreference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO\ncan be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including\nwidely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different\nmodel sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench,\nAlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in\nalignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.",

Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to\nRL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves\nsemantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores\ncan still drift away from the user's intended meaning.\n  We introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency\nyet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO adjusts the DPO loss using a\nweight based on how different the winning prompt is from the original, reducing\nthe impact of training examples that are semantically misaligned. We provide\nthe first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt\ngenerators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably\nbounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image\nprompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12%\nhigher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1,\nPickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

    "abstract": "Scientific Workflow Systems such as Galaxy and Nextflow are essential for\nscalable, reproducible, and automated bioinformatics analyses. However,\ndeveloping and understanding scientific workflows remains challenging for many\ndomain scientists due to the complexity of tool/module selection,\ninfrastructure requirements, and limited programming expertise. This study\nexplores whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models such as GPT-4o, Gemini\n2.5 Flash, and DeepSeek-V3 can assist in generating accurate, complete, and\nusable bioinformatics workflows. We evaluate a set of representative workflows\ncovering tasks such as RNA-seq, SNP analysis, and DNA methylation across both\nGalaxy (graphical) and Nextflow (script-based) platforms. To simulate realistic\nusage, we adopt a tiered prompting strategy: each workflow is first generated\nusing an instruction-only prompt; if the output is incomplete or incorrect, we\nescalate to a role-based prompt, and finally to chain-of-thought prompting if\nneeded. The generated workflows are evaluated against community-curated\nbaselines from the Galaxy Training Network and nf-core, using criteria\nincluding correctness, completeness, tool appropriateness, and executability.\nResults show that LLMs exhibit strong potential in workflow development. Gemini\n2.5 Flash produced the most accurate and user-friendly workflows in Galaxy,\nwhile DeepSeek-V3 excelled in Nextflow pipeline generation. GPT-4o performed\nnicely with structured prompts. Prompting strategy significantly influenced\noutput quality, with role-based and chain-of-thought prompts enhancing\ncorrectness and completeness. Overall, LLMs can reduce the cognitive and\ntechnical barriers to workflow development, making SWSs more accessible to\nnovice and expert users. This work highlights the practical utility of LLMs and\nprovides actionable insights for integrating them into real-world\nbioinformatics workflow design.",

Existing\ntheoretical sink strength models for microstructures like DLs and GBs fail to\naccount for the observed saturation of HI retention. In this study, we propose\na novel universal trapping-site model that dynamically represents sink\nstrengths as time-dependent site concentrations, which is incorporated into an\nimproved cluster dynamics model for high-fluence HI irradiation. Our\nsimulations quantitatively reproduce the saturated low-energy deuterium (D)\nretention and depth profiles in W, in good agreement with experiments. A\ncritical saturation fluence of approximately 1023 m-2 is identified, below\nwhich unsaturated D retention is governed by both GBs and ion-induced defects,\nwhereas above this threshold GBs dominate D retention by trapping free D and\napproaching their theoretical saturation limit. The trapping-site sink strength\nmodel enables quantification of H trapping by diverse microstructures via\nunified effective site concentrations, providing mechanistic insights into\nmicrostructural effects and facilitating direct evaluation of HI retention in\nPFMs under different irradiation conditions.",

This paper introduces Local2Global, an\nonline framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art\nperformance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion.\nLeveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel\nsets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial\nfeatures from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal\nrepresentations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer\ndecoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries.\nThis alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame\ninformation while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth\ntransition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the\nsegmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory\nmechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS\ndatasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training,\nsurpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings.

    "abstract": "We introduce the Graded Transformer framework, a new class of sequence models\nthat embeds algebraic inductive biases through grading transformations on\nvector spaces. Extending Graded Neural Networks (GNNs), we propose two\narchitectures: the Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and the Exponentially\nGraded Transformer (EGT). These models apply parameterized scaling operators,\ngoverned by fixed or learnable grading tuples and in the case of EGT\nexponential factors, to encode hierarchical structure in attention and\nrepresentation layers and to improve efficiency for structured data.\n  We establish rigorous guarantees, including universal approximation theorems\nfor continuous and Sobolev functions, reduced sample complexity via effective\nVC dimension bounds, Lipschitz continuity of graded operations, and robustness\nto perturbations. A graded loss ensures gradient stability and alignment with\ndomain priors during optimization. By treating grades as differentiable\nparameters, the framework enables adaptive feature prioritization, overcoming\nlimitations of fixed grades in earlier models.\n  The Graded Transformer provides a mathematically principled approach to\nhierarchical learning and neuro-symbolic reasoning. Applications include\nalgebraic geometry (moduli spaces and zeta functions), physics (multiscale\nsystems), natural language processing (syntactic parsing), biological sequence\nanalysis (variant prediction), robotics and autonomous systems (safety-critical\nprioritization), the automotive industry (certifiable AI for ADAS), and\nblockchain and financial cryptography (secure coding and structured\nprediction).",

Our results reveal a strong stretch dependence of\narterial viscoelasticity, with increasing prestress leading to a reduction in\ntissue viscosity.

Following detector calibration of the detector\nsignal as a function of primary beam energy, measurements using a 12 keV\nprimary beam on Si(100) reveal a broad BSE energy distribution across the\ndiffraction pattern, extending down to 3 keV.

    "abstract": "In multi-condition EEG experiments, brain activity is recorded as subjects\nperform various tasks or are exposed to different stimuli. The recorded signals\nare commonly transformed into time-frequency representations, which often\ndisplay smooth variations across time and frequency dimensions. These\nrepresentations are naturally structured as two-way functional data, with\nexperimental conditions nested within subjects. Existing analytical methods\nfail to jointly account for the data's multilevel structure, functional nature,\nand dependence on subject-level covariates. To address these limitations, we\npropose a Bayesian mixed-effects model for two-way functional data that\nincorporates covariate-dependent fixed effects at the condition level and\nmultilevel random effects. For enhanced model interpretability and parsimony,\nwe introduce a novel covariate-dependent CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition\nfor the fixed effects, with marginally interpretable time and frequency\npatterns. We further propose a sparsity-inducing prior for CP rank selection\nand an efficient algorithm for posterior sampling. The proposed method is\nevaluated through extensive simulations and applied to EEG data collected to\ninvestigate the effects of alcoholism on cognitive processing in response to\nvisual stimuli. Our analysis reveals distinct patterns of time-frequency\nactivity associated with alcoholism, offering new insights into the neural\nprocessing differences between subject groups and experimental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Speech language models refer to language models with speech processing and\nunderstanding capabilities. One key desirable capability for speech language\nmodels is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content\nand prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language\nmodels, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into\nLLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the\nresulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities\nvia pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which\nintroduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each\nspeech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of\nword-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization\nschemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody\ninformation, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that\nProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing\ncapabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody\nnuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion\nand stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long\ncontexts.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) has proven to be a robust and\nprominent method for creating non-classical light sources of entangled\nsingle-photon pairs. However, such sources suffer from low efficiency due to\nthe inherent weakness of the SPDC process. Moreover, there is no control of\npolarization in the generated photons. Circular polarized SPDC-based sources\nwith efficient chiral response are currently missing, which severely precludes\nthe realization of a wide range of practical applications in quantum computing\nand communications. The current work solves these inherent problems by\ndemonstrating a novel chiral plasmonic metasurface that leverages a strong\nquasi-bound state in the continuum (qBIC) resonance which significantly\nincreases the SPDC photon generation efficiency and realizes circular polarized\n(chiral) single-photon pairs. The presented metasurface design is ultrathin,\nsupports efficient free space outcoupling of chiral classical and quantum\nradiation, and operates at room temperature. Hence, it offers the potential to\nrealize a compact and integrable quantum source of circularly polarized\nentangled single-photon pairs.",

    "abstract": "Developing effective multimodal data fusion strategies has become\nincreasingly essential for improving the predictive power of statistical\nmachine learning methods across a wide range of applications, from autonomous\ndriving to medical diagnosis. Traditional fusion methods, including early,\nintermediate, and late fusion, integrate data at different stages, each\noffering distinct advantages and limitations. In this paper, we introduce Meta\nFusion, a flexible and principled framework that unifies these existing\nstrategies as special cases. Motivated by deep mutual learning and ensemble\nlearning, Meta Fusion constructs a cohort of models based on various\ncombinations of latent representations across modalities, and further boosts\npredictive performance through soft information sharing within the cohort. Our\napproach is model-agnostic in learning the latent representations, allowing it\nto flexibly adapt to the unique characteristics of each modality.\nTheoretically, our soft information sharing mechanism reduces the\ngeneralization error. Empirically, Meta Fusion consistently outperforms\nconventional fusion strategies in extensive simulation studies. We further\nvalidate our approach on real-world applications, including Alzheimer's disease\ndetection and neural decoding.",

    "abstract": "Studies suggest that involuntary eye movements exhibit greater stability\nduring active motion compared to passive motion, and this effect may also apply\nto the operation of ride-on machinery. Moreover, a study suggested that\nexperimentally manipulating the sense of agency (SoA) by introducing delays may\ninfluence the stability of involuntary eye movements. Although a preliminary\ninvestigation examined involuntary eye movements and perceived maneuverability\nunder two distinct machine dynamics with preserved SoA, it remains unclear how\nsystematic variations in motion dynamics influence these factors. Therefore,\nthe purpose of the present research was to investigate whether systematic\nvariations in the dynamic properties of a ride-on machine, where the perceived\nmaneuverability is modulated, influence the accuracy of involuntary eye\nmovements in human operators. Participants rode a yaw-rotational platform whose\ntime constant from joystick input to motor torque of a rotational machine was\nsystematically manipulated. During the operation, eye movements were recorded\nwhile participants fixated on a visual target. After each condition,\nparticipants provided subjective ratings of maneuverability and cognitive load.\nAs the platform's time constant increased, the perceived maneuverability scores\ndecreased while the cognitive loads increased. Concurrently, involuntary eye\nmovement accuracy decreased. Moderate to weak positive correlations emerged\nbetween the perceived maneuverability scores and the eye movement gain and\naccuracy, while a weak negative correlation was found with cognitive load.",

    "abstract": "RSA exponent reduction and AES S-box inversion share a hidden commonality:\nboth are governed by the same impartial combinatorial principle, which we call\na Product-Congruence Game (PCG). A Product-Congruence Game tracks play via the\nmodular or finite-field product of heap values, providing a single invariant\nthat unifies the algebraic cores of these two ubiquitous symmetric and\nasymmetric cryptosystems. We instantiate this framework with two companion\ngames. First, $\\phi$-MuM, in which a left-associated \"multi-secret\" RSA\nexponent chain compresses into the game of Multiplicative Modular Nim,\nPCG($k,\\{1\\}$), where $k = ord_N(g)$. The losing predicate then factorizes via\nthe Chinese remainder theorem, mirroring RSA's structure. Second, poly-MuM, our\nmodel for finite-field inversion such as the AES S-box. For poly-MuM we prove\nthe single-hole property inside its threshold region, implying that the\nSprague-Grundy values are multiplicative under disjunctive sums in that region.\nBeyond these instances, we establish four structural theorems for a general\nProduct-Congruence Game PCG($m,R$): (i) single-heap repair above the modulus,\n(ii) ultimate period $m$ per coordinate, (iii) exact and asymptotic losing\ndensities, and (iv) confinement of optimal play to a finite indeterminacy\nregion. An operation-alignment collapse principle explains why some variants\ndegenerate to a single aggregate while MuM, $\\phi$-MuM and poly-MuM retain rich\nlocal structure. All ingredients (multiplicative orders, the Chinese remainder\ntheorem, finite fields) are classical; the contribution is the unified\naggregation-compression viewpoint that embeds both RSA and AES inside one\nimpartial-game framework, together with the structural and collapse theorems.",

The catalog was constructed by combining near-infrared\nKs-band variability from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea eXtended survey\nand medium-resolution H-band spectroscopy from APOGEE-2, Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey IV (SDSS-IV). Variability analysis of 6.35 million sources identified\n606 variable stars. The classification of the spectral lines by semisupervised\nK-means clustering of 704 stars, refined through comparison with known catalogs\nin literature and visual inspection of the spectra, was performed. Combined\nwith Ks variability, the final catalog contains three groups: Emission-line\nYSOs, Absorption-line YSOs, and Literature/Variable-identified YSOs. Cross\nvalidation with the Gaia DR3 proper motion and distance estimates supports\nCarina membership for 415 sources. The statistical characterization of YSO\nvariability demonstrated that most Carina members (78%) exhibit variability\npatterns. Of these, 134 stars show emissions in their spectra, which is\nconsistent with some accretion processes. Analysis of fundamental stellar\nparameters from StarHorse and Gaia DR3 reveals typical distributions of YSOs,\ndominated by low-mass 1-4 Msun, solar-metallicity stars with temperatures\nbetween 4000 and 6000K. Only a small fraction (4%) of the sources are more\nmassive than 4 Msun, suggesting limited ongoing massive star formation in\nCarina. This well-characterized catalog also offers a robust training dataset\nfor machine learning applications aimed at predicting YSO behavior.",
