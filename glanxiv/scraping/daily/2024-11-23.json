    "abstract": "In recent years there has been enormous interest in vision-language models\ntrained using self-supervised objectives. However, the use of large-scale\ndatasets scraped from the web for training also makes these models vulnerable\nto potential security threats, such as backdooring and poisoning attacks. In\nthis paper, we propose a method for mitigating such attacks on contrastively\ntrained vision-language models. Our approach leverages external knowledge\nextracted from a language model to prevent models from learning correlations\nbetween image regions which lack strong alignment with external knowledge. We\ndo this by imposing constraints to enforce that attention paid by the model to\nvisual regions is proportional to the alignment of those regions with external\nknowledge. We conduct extensive experiments using a variety of recent\nbackdooring and poisoning attacks on multiple datasets and architectures. Our\nresults clearly demonstrate that our proposed approach is highly effective at\ndefending against such attacks across multiple settings, while maintaining\nmodel utility and without requiring any changes at inference time",

In response, Autonomous Intelligent Cyber-defense Agents\n(AICAs) are emerging as crucial solutions. One prominent AICA agent is the\nIntrusion Response System (IRS), which is critical for mitigating threats after\ndetection. IRS uses several Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to\nmitigate attacks and restore the infrastructure to normal operations.\nContinuous monitoring of the enterprise infrastructure is an essential TTP the\nIRS uses.

We propose a unified IRS Knowledge\nGraph ontology (IRSKG) that streamlines the onboarding of new enterprise\nsystems as a source for the AICAs.

    "abstract": "Modern sequence models (e.g., Transformers, linear RNNs, etc.) emerged as\ndominant backbones of recent deep learning frameworks, mainly due to their\nefficiency, representational power, and/or ability to capture long-range\ndependencies. Adopting these sequence models for graph-structured data has\nrecently gained popularity as the alternative to Message Passing Neural\nNetworks (MPNNs). There is, however, a lack of a common foundation about what\nconstitutes a good graph sequence model, and a mathematical description of the\nbenefits and deficiencies in adopting different sequence models for learning on\ngraphs. To this end, we first present Graph Sequence Model (GSM), a unifying\nframework for adopting sequence models for graphs, consisting of three main\nsteps: (1) Tokenization, which translates the graph into a set of sequences;\n(2) Local Encoding, which encodes local neighborhoods around each node; and (3)\nGlobal Encoding, which employs a scalable sequence model to capture long-range\ndependencies within the sequences. This framework allows us to understand,\nevaluate, and compare the power of different sequence model backbones in graph\ntasks. Our theoretical evaluations of the representation power of Transformers\nand modern recurrent models through the lens of global and local graph tasks\nshow that there are both negative and positive sides for both types of models.\nBuilding on this observation, we present GSM++, a fast hybrid model that uses\nthe Hierarchical Affinity Clustering (HAC) algorithm to tokenize the graph into\nhierarchical sequences, and then employs a hybrid architecture of Transformer\nto encode these sequences. Our theoretical and experimental results support the\ndesign of GSM++, showing that GSM++ outperforms baselines in most benchmark\nevaluations.",

This paper\ninvestigates federated PCA and estimation for spiked covariance matrices under\ndistributed differential privacy constraints. We establish minimax rates of\nconvergence, with a key finding that the central server's optimal rate is the\nharmonic mean of the local clients' minimax rates. This guarantees consistent\nestimation at the central server as long as at least one local client provides\nconsistent results. Notably, consistency is maintained even if some local\nestimators are inconsistent, provided there are enough clients. These findings\nhighlight the robustness and scalability of FL for reliable statistical\ninference under privacy constraints. To establish minimax lower bounds, we\nderive a matrix version of van Trees' inequality, which is of independent\ninterest. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm that preserves\ndifferential privacy while achieving near-optimal rates at the central server,\nup to a logarithmic factor. We address significant technical challenges in\nanalyzing this algorithm, which involves a three-layer spectral decomposition.\nNumerical performance of the proposed algorithm is investigated using both\nsimulated and real data.",

In this work, we propose a novel\nopen-vocabulary monocular 3D object detection framework, dubbed OVM3D-Det,\nwhich trains detectors using only RGB images, making it both cost-effective and\nscalable to publicly available data. Unlike traditional methods, OVM3D-Det does\nnot require high-precision LiDAR or 3D sensor data for either input or\ngenerating 3D bounding boxes. Instead, it employs open-vocabulary 2D models and\npseudo-LiDAR to automatically label 3D objects in RGB images, fostering the\nlearning of open-vocabulary monocular 3D detectors. However, training 3D models\nwith labels directly derived from pseudo-LiDAR is inadequate due to imprecise\nboxes estimated from noisy point clouds and severely occluded objects. To\naddress these issues, we introduce two innovative designs: adaptive\npseudo-LiDAR erosion and bounding box refinement with prior knowledge from\nlarge language models. These techniques effectively calibrate the 3D labels and\nenable RGB-only training for 3D detectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe superiority of OVM3D-Det over baselines in both indoor and outdoor\nscenarios. The code will be released.",

To address these challenges, we introduce OCDet, a\nlightweight Object Center Detection framework optimized for edge devices with\nNPUs. OCDet predicts heatmaps representing object center probabilities and\nextracts center points through peak identification. Unlike prior methods using\nfixed Gaussian distribution, we introduce Generalized Centerness (GC) to\ngenerate ground truth heatmaps from bounding box annotations, providing finer\nspatial details without additional manual labeling. Built on NPU-friendly\nSemantic FPN with MobileNetV4 backbones, OCDet models are trained by our\nBalanced Continuous Focal Loss (BCFL), which alleviates data imbalance and\nfocuses training on hard negative examples for probability regression tasks.\nLeveraging the novel Center Alignment Score (CAS) with Hungarian matching, we\ndemonstrate that OCDet consistently outperforms YOLO11 in object center\ndetection, achieving up to 23% higher CAS while requiring 42% fewer parameters,\n34% less computation, and 64% lower NPU latency. When compared to keypoint\ndetection frameworks, OCDet achieves substantial CAS improvements up to 186%\nusing identical models.

We focus on massive binary systems that evolve into double\ncompact object (DCO) binaries after the exposed core of the giant collapses to\nform a second NS or BH. A CBD around the binary system of the giant's core and\nthe compact object lives for a short time at the termination of the CEE phase\nand alters the orbital evolution of the binary. We parameterize the conditions\nfor CBD formation in post-CEE binaries and present characteristics of DCO\nprogenitors that are likely or unlikely to form CBDs. We find that CBD\nformation is most common in BH-BH binaries and NS-NS binaries that are expected\nto merge within Hubble time. Furthermore, we find that the interaction of the\nCBD with the core - NS/BH system at the termination of the CEE reduces the\nexpected rate of DCO mergers, regardless of whether these binaries tighten or\nexpand due to this interaction. If the binary system loses angular momentum to\nthe CBD, it may produce a luminous transient due to a merger between the NS/BH\nand the core of the giant rather than gravitational wave sources.

Its low Li abundance is also consistent\nwith a mass accretion episode. Aims. We determine Li and Be abundances for this\nstar and evaluate its radial velocity time series, activity cycle, and spectral\nenergy distribution in search of clues regarding the origin of this enigmatic\nstar. Methods. Li and Be abundances were determined via spectral synthesis of\ntheir resonance lines using HARPS and UVES spectra, respectively. HARPS data\nwere also used to study variations in the star's radial velocity and activity\nlevels. Photometric data were adopted to evaluate the stellar spectral energy\ndistribution. Results. HD 65908 is severely Li- and Be-depleted. Its radial\nvelocity is nearly constant ($\\sigma =$ 2 m/s), with a small modulation likely\nassociated with stellar activity, and the star shows no further signs of an\nundetected close companion.

    "abstract": "Decayless kink oscillations, characterized by their lack of decay in\namplitude, have been detected in coronal loops of varying scales in active\nregions, quiet Sun and coronal holes. Short-period (< 50 s) decayless\noscillations have been detected in short loops (< 50 Mm) within active regions.\nNevertheless, long-period decayless oscillations in these loops remain\nrelatively unexplored and crucial for understanding the wave modes and\nexcitation mechanisms of decayless oscillations. We present the statistical\nanalysis of decayless oscillations from two active regions observed by the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) onboard Solar Orbiter. The average loop length\nand period of the detected oscillations are 19 Mm and 151 seconds,\nrespectively. We find 82 long-period and 23 short-period oscillations in these\nloops. We do not obtain a significant correlation between loop length and\nperiod. We discuss the possibility of different wave modes in short loops,\nalthough standing waves can not be excluded from possible wave modes.\nFurthermore, a different branch exists for active region short loops in the\nloop length vs period relation, similar to decayless waves in short loops in\nquiet Sun and coronal holes. The magnetic fields derived from MHD seismology,\nbased on standing kink modes, show lower values for multiple oscillations\ncompared to previous estimates for long loops in active regions. Additionally,\nthe comparison of period distributions in short loops across different coronal\nregions indicates that different excitation mechanisms may trigger short-period\nkink oscillations in active regions compared to the quiet Sun and coronal\nholes.",

Therefore, major complications arise when dealing with first-order\nalgorithms, in which gradient computations are challenging or even impossible\nin various scenarios. For this reason, we resort to derivative-free methods\n(zeroth-order methods). This paper is devoted to an approach to minimizing\nquasi-convex functions using a recently proposed comparison oracle only. This\noracle compares function values at two points and tells which is larger, thus\nby the proposed approach, the comparisons are all we need to solve the\noptimization problem under consideration. The proposed algorithm to solve the\nconsidered problem is based on the technique of comparison-based gradient\ndirection estimation and the comparison-based approximation normalized gradient\ndescent. The normalized gradient descent algorithm is an adaptation of gradient\ndescent, which updates according to the direction of the gradients, rather than\nthe gradients themselves.

Notably, such systems only form in\nsimulations with very weak black hole natal kicks ($\\lesssim 5\\,{\\rm\nkm\\,s^{-1}}$) because stronger kicks unbind the tertiaries. Our simulations\nalso predict a population of BH-LMXB triples that form via the classical\ncommon-envelope channel, when the BH progenitor does overflow its Roche lobe.\nThe formation rate for this channel is also higher in triples than in isolated\nbinaries because early EKL oscillations cause inner binaries with a wider range\nof initial separations to enter and survive a common envelope.

    "abstract": "The physical world dynamics are generally governed by underlying partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) with unknown analytical forms in science and\nengineering problems. Neural network based data-driven approaches have been\nheavily studied in simulating and solving PDE problems in recent years, but it\nis still challenging to move forward from understanding to controlling the\nunknown PDE dynamics. PDE boundary control instantiates a simplified but\nimportant problem by only focusing on PDE boundary conditions as the control\ninput and output. However, current model-free PDE controllers cannot ensure the\nboundary output satisfies some given user-specified safety constraint. To this\nend, we propose a safety filtering framework to guarantee the boundary output\nstays within the safe set for current model-free controllers. Specifically, we\nfirst introduce a neural boundary control barrier function (BCBF) to ensure the\nfeasibility of the trajectory-wise constraint satisfaction of boundary output.\nBased on the neural operator modeling the transfer function from boundary\ncontrol input to output trajectories, we show that the change in the BCBF\ndepends linearly on the change in input boundary, so quadratic\nprogramming-based safety filtering can be done for pre-trained model-free\ncontrollers. Extensive experiments under challenging hyperbolic, parabolic and\nNavier-Stokes PDE dynamics environments validate the plug-and-play\neffectiveness of the proposed method by achieving better general performance\nand boundary constraint satisfaction compared to the vanilla and constrained\nmodel-free controller baselines.

An exception is for the largest eigenvalue,\nwhere there is a formalism due to Chiani which uses a combination of the\nPfaffian structure underlying the ensembles, and a recursive computation of the\nmatrix elements.

Applications are given to\nillustrating various asymptotic formulas, local central limit theorems, and\ncentral limit theorems, as well as to probing finite size corrections.

In this paper, we start from a new\nperspective to excavate the reason behind the failure generalization in AIGI\ndetection, named the \\textit{asymmetry phenomenon}, where a naively trained\ndetector tends to favor overfitting to the limited and monotonous fake\npatterns, causing the feature space to become highly constrained and\nlow-ranked, which is proved seriously limiting the expressivity and\ngeneralization. One potential remedy is incorporating the pre-trained knowledge\nwithin the vision foundation models (higher-ranked) to expand the feature\nspace, alleviating the model's overfitting to fake. To this end, we employ\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the original feature space into\n\\textit{two orthogonal subspaces}. By freezing the principal components and\nadapting only the remained components, we preserve the pre-trained knowledge\nwhile learning fake patterns. Compared to existing full-parameters and\nLoRA-based tuning methods, we explicitly ensure orthogonality, enabling the\nhigher rank of the whole feature space, effectively minimizing overfitting and\nenhancing generalization. We finally identify a crucial insight: our method\nimplicitly learns \\textit{a vital prior that fakes are actually derived from\nthe real}, indicating a hierarchical relationship rather than independence.\nModeling this prior, we believe, is essential for achieving superior\ngeneralization.

Our\napproach can be integrated into quantum computing platforms to provide an\naccurate estimation of quantum execution time and be used as a reference for\nprioritizing quantum execution jobs.\n  In addition, our findings provide insights for quantum program developers to\noptimize their programs in terms of execution time consumption, for example, by\nprioritizing one-qubit gates over two-qubit gates.",

However, current SSC methods are\nconstrained by model size, sequence length, and single-label setting. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes LLM-SSC, a large language model\n(LLM)-based framework for both single- and multi-label SSC tasks. Unlike\nprevious approaches that employ small- or medium-sized language models, the\nproposed framework utilizes LLMs to generate SSC labels through designed\nprompts, which enhance task understanding by incorporating demonstrations and a\nquery to describe the prediction target. We also present a multi-label\ncontrastive learning loss with auto-weighting scheme, enabling the multi-label\nclassification task. To support our multi-label SSC analysis, we introduce and\nrelease a new dataset, biorc800, which mainly contains unstructured abstracts\nin the biomedical domain with manual annotations. Experiments demonstrate\nLLM-SSC's strong performance in SSC under both in-context learning and\ntask-specific tuning settings.

    "abstract": "The Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, SEI, formed on a battery electrode has been\na central area of research for decades. This thin, complex layer profoundly\nimpacts the electrochemical deposition morphology and stability of the metal in\nbattery anodes. Departing from conventional approaches, we investigate metal\ndissolution, the reverse reaction of deposition, in battery environments using\na state-of-the-art electroanalytical system combining a rotating-disk electrode\nand in-operando visualization. Our key finding is the presence of a Transient\nSolid-Electrolyte Interphase, T-SEI, that forms during fast discharging at high\ndissolution rates. We attribute T-SEI formation to transient local\nsupersaturation and resultant electrolyte salt deposition. The T-SEI\nfundamentally alters the dissolution kinetics at the electrochemical interface,\nleading to a self-limiting morphological evolution and eventually yielding a\nflat, clean surface. Unlike a classical SEI formed due to electrolyte\ndecomposition, the T-SEI is fully relaxable upon removal of the enforced\ndissolution current. The formation of T-SEI, surprisingly, plays a critical\nrole in the subsequent electrodeposition. When the metal is redeposited on a\nfully relaxed T-SEI surface, the morphology is remarkably different from that\ndeposited on pristine or low-rate discharged metal electrodes. Electron\nbackscatter diffraction analysis suggests the deposition occurs via growth of\nthe original grains. This is in stark contrast to the isolated, particulate\nnuclei seen on standard metal electrodes without T-SEI formation. Our findings\nprovide important insights into the electrochemical kinetics at the\nmetal-electrolyte interface, particularly in concentrated or water-in-salt\nelectrolytes that are close to the salt saturation limit. The results suggest a\nnew dimension for electrochemical engineering in batteries.",

    "abstract": "In many real-world applications, continuous machine learning (ML) systems are\ncrucial but prone to data drift, a phenomenon where discrepancies between\nhistorical training data and future test data lead to significant performance\ndegradation and operational inefficiencies. Traditional drift adaptation\nmethods typically update models using ensemble techniques, often discarding\ndrifted historical data, and focus primarily on either covariate drift or\nconcept drift. These methods face issues such as high resource demands,\ninability to manage all types of drifts effectively, and neglecting the\nvaluable context that historical data can provide. We contend that explicitly\nincorporating drifted data into the model training process significantly\nenhances model accuracy and robustness. This paper introduces an advanced\nframework that integrates the strengths of data-centric approaches with\nadaptive management of both covariate and concept drift in a scalable and\nefficient manner. Our framework employs sophisticated data segmentation\ntechniques to identify optimal data batches that accurately reflect test data\npatterns. These data batches are then utilized for training on test data,\nensuring that the models remain relevant and accurate over time. By leveraging\nthe advantages of both data segmentation and scalable drift management, our\nsolution ensures robust model accuracy and operational efficiency in\nlarge-scale ML deployments. It also minimizes resource consumption and\ncomputational overhead by selecting and utilizing relevant data subsets,\nleading to significant cost savings.

Disentanglement\ninvolves separating the latent space into components for coherent information\nshared by all waveforms and components for waveform-specific nuisance\ninformation. SymAE employs a generative model that independently generates\nwaveforms based on coherent and nuisance components, and an inference model\nthat estimates these components from observed wavefield. By assuming the\nindependence of waveforms conditioned on coherent information, the model\neffectively accumulates this information across multiple waveforms. After\ntraining, a metric based on Kullback-Leibler divergence is used to evaluate the\ninformativeness of individual waveforms, enabling latent-space optimization and\nthe generation of synthetic seismograms with enhanced signal-to-noise ratios.\nTo demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method, we applied it to a data set\nof teleseismic displacement waveforms of the P wave from deep-focus\nearthquakes.

For\nmulti-class classification, the custom CNN, with a slight architectural\nmodification, achieved an accuracy of 98.09%, on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset.\nComparatively, ResNet18 and VGG16 maintained high performance levels, but the\ncustom CNNs provided a more computationally efficient alternative.\nAdditionally,the custom CNNs were evaluated using few-shot learning (0, 5, 10,\n15, 20, 40, and 80 shots) to assess their robustness, achieving notable\naccuracy improvements with increased shots. This study highlights the potential\nof well-designed, less complex CNN architectures as effective and\ncomputationally efficient alternatives to deeper, pre-trained models for\nmedical imaging tasks, including brain tumor classification.

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of human body 3D reconstruction technology\nacross various fields, the demands for data transmission and processing\nefficiency continue to rise, particularly in scenarios where network bandwidth\nis limited and low latency is required. This paper introduces an Adversarial\nFeature Learning-based Semantic Communication method (AFLSC) for human body 3D\nreconstruction, which focuses on extracting and transmitting semantic\ninformation crucial for the 3D reconstruction task, thereby significantly\noptimizing data flow and alleviating bandwidth pressure. At the sender's end,\nwe propose a multitask learning-based feature extraction method to capture the\nspatial layout, keypoints, posture, and depth information from 2D human images,\nand design a semantic encoding technique based on adversarial feature learning\nto encode these feature information into semantic data. We also develop a\ndynamic compression technique to efficiently transmit this semantic data,\ngreatly enhancing transmission efficiency and reducing latency. At the\nreceiver's end, we design an efficient multi-level semantic feature decoding\nmethod to convert semantic data back into key image features. Finally, an\nimproved ViT-diffusion model is employed for 3D reconstruction, producing human\nbody 3D mesh models.

Recently, large language models\n(LLMs) achieve the SOTA performance on code generation.

To improve the reliability and quality of the generated\ncodes, researchers propose to leverage Consistency to obtain a better code\nbased on generating and ranking multiple candidates. The existing approach is\nproblematic as Consistency thinks a code is better when (1) the code pass more\ntests (inter-consistency) (2) more codes share the same behavior\n(intra-consistency). However, because the tests are also generated by LLMs,\nthey could be wrong as well. As a result, majority voting based on testing\nresults is unreliable.

This\nstudy conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on how different\nviewing modalities, including intervened rotation, avatar assistance, guidance\ncues, and perspective shifting, influence the CVR experience. The study has\nscreened 3444 papers (between 01/01/2013 and 17/06/2023) and selected 45 for\nsystematic review, 13 of which also for meta-analysis. We conducted separate\nrandom-effects meta-analysis and applied Robust Variance Estimation to examine\nCVR viewing modalities and user experience outcomes. Evidence from experiments\nwas synthesized as differences between standardized mean differences (SMDs) of\nuser experience of control group (\"Swivel-Chair\" CVR) and experiment groups. To\nour surprise, we found inconsistencies in the effect sizes across different\nstudies, even with the same viewing modalities. Moreover, in these studies,\nterms such as \"presence,\" \"immersion,\" and \"narrative engagement\" were often\nused interchangeably. Their irregular use of questionnaires, overreliance on\nself-developed questionnaires, and incomplete data reporting may have led to\nunrigorous evaluations of CVR experiences. This study contributes to\nHuman-Computer Interaction (HCI) research by identifying gaps in CVR research,\nemphasizing the need for standardization of terminologies and methodologies to\nenhance the reliability and comparability of future CVR research.",

    "abstract": "Photorealistic reconstruction of street scenes is essential for developing\nreal-world simulators in autonomous driving. While recent methods based on\n3D/4D Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated promising results, they still\nencounter challenges in complex street scenes due to the unpredictable motion\nof dynamic objects. Current methods typically decompose street scenes into\nstatic and dynamic objects, learning the Gaussians in either a supervised\nmanner (e.g., w/ 3D bounding-box) or a self-supervised manner (e.g., w/o 3D\nbounding-box). However, these approaches do not effectively model the motions\nof dynamic objects (e.g., the motion speed of pedestrians is clearly different\nfrom that of vehicles), resulting in suboptimal scene decomposition. To address\nthis, we propose Explicit Motion Decomposition (EMD), which models the motions\nof dynamic objects by introducing learnable motion embeddings to the Gaussians,\nenhancing the decomposition in street scenes. The proposed plug-and-play EMD\nmodule compensates for the lack of motion modeling in self-supervised street\nGaussian splatting methods. We also introduce tailored training strategies to\nextend EMD to supervised approaches. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art novel view synthesis\nperformance in self-supervised settings.

Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our training-free method outperforms existing methods in both\nqualitative and quantitative evaluations, matching or surpassing fine-tuned\nmodels.

Typically, segmentation models are trained\nusing a single modality, which limits their ability to generalize to other\ntypes of input data without employing transfer learning techniques.\nAdditionally, leveraging complementary information from different modalities to\nenhance segmentation precision often necessitates substantial modifications to\npopular encoder-decoder designs, such as introducing multiple branched encoding\nor decoding paths for each modality. In this work, we propose a simple\nMulti-Modal Segmentation (MulModSeg) strategy to enhance medical image\nsegmentation across multiple modalities, specifically CT and MR. It\nincorporates two key designs: a modality-conditioned text embedding framework\nvia a frozen text encoder that adds modality awareness to existing segmentation\nframeworks without significant structural modifications or computational\noverhead, and an alternating training procedure that facilitates the\nintegration of essential features from unpaired CT and MR inputs.

Notably, models do not\nfavour their own responses, instead they provide similar creativity assessment\nscores or rankings for alternative uses generated by other models.

A particularly challenging\nproblem is developing transferable targeted attacks that can mislead DNN models\ninto predicting specific target classes. While various methods have been\nproposed to enhance attack transferability, they often incur substantial\ncomputational costs while yielding limited improvements. Recent clean feature\nmixup methods use random clean features to perturb the feature space but lack\noptimization for disrupting adversarial examples, overlooking the advantages of\nattack-specific perturbations. In this paper, we propose Feature Tuning Mixup\n(FTM), a novel method that enhances targeted attack transferability by\ncombining both random and optimized noises in the feature space. FTM introduces\nlearnable feature perturbations and employs an efficient stochastic update\nstrategy for optimization. These learnable perturbations facilitate the\ngeneration of more robust adversarial examples with improved transferability.\nWe further demonstrate that attack performance can be enhanced through an\nensemble of multiple FTM-perturbed surrogate models. Extensive experiments on\nthe ImageNet-compatible dataset across various DNN models demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while\nmaintaining low computational cost.",

Here we we extend the\ninvestigation to the high-density limit of an odd tracer embedded in a\nsoft-Gaussian core medium (GCM) using a field-theoretic approach based on the\nDean-Kawasaki equation. Our theory reveals that interactions can enhance the\ndynamics of an odd tracer even in dense systems. We demonstrate that oddness\nresults in a complete reversal of the well-known self-diffusion\n($D_\\mathrm{s}$) anomaly of the GCM. Ordinarily, $D_\\mathrm{s}$ exhibits a\nnon-monotonic trend with increasing density, approaching but remaining below\nthe interaction-free diffusion, $D_0$, ($D_\\mathrm{s} < D_0$) so that\n$D_\\mathrm{s} \\uparrow D_0$ at high densities. In contrast, for an odd tracer,\nself-diffusion is enhanced ($D_\\mathrm{s}> D_0$) and the GCM anomaly is\ninverted, displaying $D_\\mathrm{s} \\downarrow D_0$ at high densities. The\ntransition between the standard and reversed GCM anomaly is governed by the\ntracer's oddness, with a critical oddness value at which the tracer diffuses as\na free particle ($D_\\mathrm{s} \\approx D_0$) across all densities. We validate\nour theoretical predictions with Brownian dynamics simulations, finding strong\nagreement between the two.",

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) report generation is crucial to assist radiologists\nin interpreting CT volumes, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive.\nExisting methods primarily only consider the global features of the entire\nvolume, making it struggle to focus on specific regions and potentially missing\nabnormalities. To address this issue, we propose Reg2RG, the first\nregion-guided referring and grounding framework for CT report generation, which\nenhances diagnostic performance by focusing on anatomical regions within the\nvolume. Specifically, we utilize masks from a universal segmentation module to\ncapture local features for each referring region. A local feature decoupling\n(LFD) strategy is proposed to preserve the local high-resolution details with\nlittle computational overhead. Then the local features are integrated with\nglobal features to capture inter-regional relationships within a cohesive\ncontext. Moreover, we propose a novel region-report alignment (RRA) training\nstrategy. It leverages the recognition of referring regions to guide the\ngeneration of region-specific reports, enhancing the model's referring and\ngrounding capabilities while also improving the report's interpretability. A\nlarge language model (LLM) is further employed as the language decoder to\ngenerate reports from integrated visual features, facilitating region-level\ncomprehension. Extensive experiments on two large-scale chest CT-report\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, which outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of both natural language generation and\nclinical efficacy metrics while preserving promising interpretability.

    "abstract": "Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to selectively erase harmful behaviors from\nmodels while retaining the overall utility of the model. As a multi-task\nlearning problem, MU involves balancing objectives related to forgetting\nspecific concepts/data and preserving general performance. A naive integration\nof these forgetting and preserving objectives can lead to gradient conflicts\nand dominance, impeding MU algorithms from reaching optimal solutions. To\naddress the gradient conflict and dominance issue, we reformulate MU as a\ntwo-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting\nplayer and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to\nmaximize their overall gain and balance their contributions. To this end,\ninspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to\nguide the model toward the Pareto stationary point. Our formulation of MU\nguarantees an equilibrium solution, where any deviation from the final state\nwould lead to a reduction in the overall objectives for both players, ensuring\noptimality in each objective.

    "abstract": "Most studies of collective phenomena in oscillator networks focus on directly\ncoupled systems as exemplified by the classical Kuramoto model. However, there\nare growing number of examples in which oscillators interact indirectly via a\ncommon external medium, including bacterial quorum sensing (QS) networks,\npedestrians walking on a bridge, and centrally coupled lasers. In this paper we\nanalyze the effects of stochastic phase resetting on a Kuramoto model with\nindirect coupling. All the phases are simultaneously reset to their initial\nvalues at a random sequence of times generated from a Poisson process. On the\nother hand, the external environmental state is not reset. We first derive a\ncontinuity equation for the population density in the presence of resetting and\nshow how the resulting density equation is itself subject to stochastic\nresetting. We then use an Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz to reduce the\ninfinite-dimensional system to a four-dimensional piecewise deterministic\nsystem with subsystem resetting. The latter is used to explore how\nsynchronization depends on a cell density parameter. (In bacterial QS this\nrepresents the ratio of the population cell volume and the extracellular\nvolume.) At high densities we recover the OA dynamics of the classical Kuramoto\nmodel with global resetting. On the other hand, at low densities, we show how\nsubsystem resetting has a major effect on collective synchronization, ranging\nfrom noise-induced transitions to slow/fast dynamics.",

On top of that, the decoding of URLLC messages cannot leverage\nsuccessive interference cancellation (SIC) owing to the stringent latency\nrequirements. This can significantly degrade the spectral efficiency of all\nURLLC users when the interference is strong. To overcome this issue, we propose\na new multiple access scheme employing discrete signaling and treating\ninterference as noise (TIN) decoding, i.e., without SIC. Specifically, to\nhandle heterogeneous interference while maintaining the single-user encoding\nand decoding complexities, each user uses a single channel code and maps its\ncoded bits onto sub-blocks of symbols, where the underlying constellations can\nbe different. We demonstrate theoretically and numerically that the proposed\nscheme employing quadrature amplitude modulations and TIN decoding can perform\nvery close to the benchmark scheme based on Gaussian signaling with perfect SIC\ndecoding.

To enhance Botfip's\nlearning of Formula Strings and expand its applicability to related tasks, we\npropose the Botfip-LLM framework based on knowledge distillation, incorporating\npre-trained large language models for aligning symbolic tree data. Experimental\nanalysis shows that the choice of LLM is crucial, with ChatGLM-2 outperforming\nothers in training and testing. Botfip-LLM not only improves performance,\ngeneralization, and extrapolation over the original Botfip model but also\nsignificantly enhances applicability to Formula String-related tasks, enabling\nmore diverse task handling.",

Ensuring robust functionality\nand stability of the sensors in dynamic environments necessitates profound\ndomain expertise and computationally intensive multi-physics simulations. This\npaper introduces a novel approach using a Physics-Informed Neural Network\n(PINN) based surrogate model to accelerate the design process. The PINN model\nsolves the governing electrostatic equations describing the interaction between\na finger and a capacitive sensor. Inputs include spatial coordinates from a 3D\ndomain encompassing the finger, sensor, and PCB, along with finger distances.\nBy incorporating the electrostatic equations directly into the neural network's\nloss function, the model captures the underlying physics. The learned model\nthus serves as a surrogate sensor model on which inference can be carried out\nin seconds for different experimental setups without the need to run\nsimulations. Efficacy results evaluated on unseen test cases demonstrate the\nsignificant potential of PINNs in accelerating the development and design\noptimization of capacitive touch sensors.",

Our analysis indicates that AGN identifications based solely on\nSED fitting are unreliable, resulting in an unexpectedly low detection rate. By\nrestricting our sample to optically classified Type 2 AGNs that satisfy the\nmid-IR color criteria, we achieve a maser detection rate of ~13-18%, aligning\nwith previous predictions for mid-IR red sources.

This is particularly important in light of major\nenvironmental changes such as industrialization, land use shifts, and natural\nevents like wildfires and dust storms. In this study, a set of fine and coarse\naerosol models called AERONET-Extended (AEROEX) models are developed based on\ncluster analysis of 30-years AERONET data, analyzing over 202,000 samples using\nGaussian Mixture Models to classify aerosol types by season and region.\nAerosols are categorized into spherical, spheroidal, and mixed types using\nparticle linear depolarization ratio and fine mode fraction. Four fine-mode\naerosol models were derived based on differences in scattering and absorption\nproperties, revealing regional/seasonal variations, particularly in North\nAmerica, Europe and Asia. Additionally, two coarse-mode aerosol models were\nidentified, separated by their absorbing properties in dust-prone and polluted\nregions. We performed simulation analysis showing that the new models\nsignificantly improve satellite-based aerosol optical depth retrievals compared\nto widely used dark target aerosol models.

This can stem\nfrom both imperfect image quality and variability in labeling preferences on\nambiguous pixels, which depend on annotator expertise and the clinical context\nof the annotations. For instance, a boundary pixel might be labeled as tumor in\ndiagnosis to avoid under-estimation of severity, but as normal tissue in\nradiotherapy to prevent damage to sensitive structures. As segmentation\npreferences vary across downstream applications, it is often desirable for an\nimage segmentation model to offer user-adaptable predictions rather than a\nfixed output. While prior uncertainty-aware and interactive methods offer\nadaptability, they are inefficient at test time: uncertainty-aware models\nrequire users to choose from numerous similar outputs, while interactive models\ndemand significant user input through click or box prompts to refine\nsegmentation. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{SPA}, a new\n\\textbf{S}egmentation \\textbf{P}reference \\textbf{A}lignment framework that\nefficiently adapts to diverse test-time preferences with minimal human\ninteraction.

The proposed framework is evaluated on several medical\nimage segmentation tasks: color fundus images, lung lesion and kidney CT scans,\nMRI scans of brain and prostate.

Furthermore, we\npropose a simple yet effective ``extended-line'' strategy in SAM-Road++ to\nmitigate the occlusion issue on the road. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nvalidity of the collected Global-Scale dataset and the proposed SAM-Road++\nmethod, particularly highlighting its superior predictive power in unseen\nregions.

    "abstract": "Optical tweezers have revolutionized particle manipulation at the micro- and\nnanoscale, playing a critical role in fields such as plasmonics, biophysics,\nand nanotechnology. While traditional optical trapping methods primarily rely\non optical forces to manipulate and organize particles, recent studies suggest\nthat optothermal traps in surfactant solutions can induce unconventional\neffects such as enhanced trapping stiffness and increased diffusion. Thus,\nthere is a need for further exploration of this system to gain a deeper\nunderstanding of the forces involved. This work investigates the behaviour of\ngold nanoparticles confined in an optothermal trap around a heated anchor\nparticle in a surfactant (CTAC) solution. We observe unexpected radial\nconfinement and synchronized rotational diffusion of particles at\nmicrometre-scale separations from the anchor particle. These dynamics differ\nfrom known optical binding and thermophoretic effects, suggesting unexplored\nforces facilitated by the surfactant environment. This study expands the\nunderstanding of optothermal trapping driven by anchor plasmonic particles and\nintroduces new possibilities for nanoparticle assembly, offering insights with\npotential applications in nanoscale fabrication and materials science.",

These fashions suffer from fixed coverage,\nevolving difficulty, and data leakage risks, limiting their effectiveness in\ncomprehensively evaluating increasingly complex generation models. To address\nthese limitations, we propose DyEval, an LLM-powered dynamic interactive visual\nassessment framework that facilitates collaborative evaluation between humans\nand generative models for text-to-image systems. DyEval features an intuitive\nvisual interface that enables users to interactively explore and analyze model\nbehaviors, while adaptively generating hierarchical, fine-grained, and diverse\ntextual inputs to continuously probe the capability boundaries of the models\nbased on their feedback. Additionally, to provide interpretable analysis for\nusers to further improve tested models, we develop a contextual reflection\nmodule that mines failure triggers of test inputs and reflects model potential\nfailure patterns supporting in-depth analysis using the logical reasoning\nability of LLM. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that\nDyEval can effectively help users identify max up to 2.56 times generation\nfailures than conventional methods, and uncover complex and rare failure\npatterns, such as issues with pronoun generation and specific cultural context\ngeneration.

Due to their high occurrence rate, glitches can overlap with GW\nsignals, as in the notable case of GW170817, the first detection of a binary\nneutron star merger. Accurate reconstruction and subtraction of these glitches\nis a challenging problem that must be addressed to ensure that scientific\nconclusions drawn from the data are reliable. This problem will intensify with\nthird-generation observatories like the Einstein Telescope (ET) due to their\nhigher detection rates of GWs and the longer duration of signals within the\nsensitivity band of the detectors. Robust glitch mitigation algorithms are,\ntherefore, crucial for maximizing the scientific output of next-generation GW\nobservatories. For the first time, we demonstrate how the null stream inherent\nin ET's unique triangular configuration can be leveraged by state-of-the-art\nglitch characterization methodology to essentially undo the effect of glitches\nfor the purpose of estimating the parameters of the source. The null stream\nbased approach enables characterization and subtraction of glitches that occur\narbitrarily close to the peak of the signal without any significant effect on\nthe quality of parameter measurements, and achieves an order of magnitude\ncomputational speed-up compared to when the null stream is not available.

The objective is to\nsystematically investigate the effects of the shoulder exoskeleton on muscle\nsynergies during overhead work.Methods: Eight male participants were recruited\nto perform a screwing task both with (Intervention) and without (Normal) the\nexoskeleton. Eight muscles were monitored and muscle synergies were extracted\nusing non-negative matrix factorization and electromyographic topographic maps.\nResults: The number of synergies extracted was the same (n = 2) in both\nconditions. Specifically, the first synergies in both conditions were\nidentical, with the highest weight of AD and MD; while the second synergies\nwere different between conditions, with highest weight of PM and MD,\nrespectively. As for the first synergy in the Intervention condition, the\nactivation profile significantly decreased, and the average recruitment level\nand activation duration were significantly lower (p<0.05). The regression\nanalysis for the muscle synergies across conditions shows the changes of muscle\nsynergies did not influence the sparseness of muscle synergies (p=0.7341). In\nthe topographic maps, the mean value exhibited a significant decrease (p<0.001)\nand the entropy significantly increased (p<0.01). Conclusion: The exoskeleton\ndoes not alter the number of synergies and existing major synergies but may\ninduce new synergies.

    "abstract": "Code snippet adaptation is a fundamental activity in the software development\nprocess. Unlike code generation, code snippet adaptation is not a \"free\ncreation\", which requires developers to tailor a given code snippet in order to\nfit specific requirements and the code context. Recently, large language models\n(LLMs) have confirmed their effectiveness in the code generation task with\npromising results. However, their performance on adaptation, a reuse-oriented\nand context-dependent code change prediction task, is still unclear. To bridge\nthis gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance and\nissues of LLMs on the adaptation task. We first evaluate the adaptation\nperformances of three popular LLMs and compare them to the code generation\ntask. Our result indicates that their adaptation ability is weaker than\ngeneration, with a nearly 15% decrease on pass@1 and more context-related\nerrors. By manually inspecting 200 cases, we further investigate the causes of\nLLMs' sub-optimal performance, which can be classified into three categories,\ni.e., Unclear Requirement, Requirement Misalignment and Context Misapplication.\nBased on the above empirical research, we propose an interactive prompting\napproach to eliciting LLMs' adaptation ability. Experimental result reveals\nthat our approach greatly improve LLMs' adaptation performance. The\nbest-performing Human-LLM interaction successfully solves 159 out of the 202\nidentified defects and improves the pass@1 and pass@5 by over 40% compared to\nthe initial instruction-based prompt. Considering human efforts, we suggest\nmulti-agent interaction as a trade-off, which can achieve comparable\nperformance with excellent generalization ability. We deem that our approach\ncould provide methodological assistance for autonomous code snippet reuse and\nadaptation with LLMs.",

In this study, we propose a novel physicochemical knowledge-guided\nmolecular meta language framework MolMetaLM. We design a molecule-specialized\nmeta language paradigm, formatted as multiple <S,P,O> (subject, predicate,\nobject) knowledge triples sharing the same S (i.e., molecule) to enhance\nlearning the semantic relationships between physicochemical knowledge and\nmolecules. By introducing different molecular knowledge and noises, the meta\nlanguage paradigm generates tens of thousands of pretraining tasks.

However, there is a\nscarcity of labeled data in current RSIOD datasets, which significantly limits\nthe performance of current detection algorithms. Although existing techniques,\ne.g., data augmentation and semi-supervised learning, can mitigate this\nscarcity issue to some extent, they are heavily dependent on high-quality\nlabeled data and perform worse in rare object classes. To address this issue,\nthis paper proposes a layout-controllable diffusion generative model (i.e.\nAeroGen) tailored for RSIOD. To our knowledge, AeroGen is the first model to\nsimultaneously support horizontal and rotated bounding box condition\ngeneration, thus enabling the generation of high-quality synthetic images that\nmeet specific layout and object category requirements. Additionally, we propose\nan end-to-end data augmentation framework that integrates a\ndiversity-conditioned generator and a filtering mechanism to enhance both the\ndiversity and quality of generated data. Experimental results demonstrate that\nthe synthetic data produced by our method are of high quality and diversity.\nFurthermore, the synthetic RSIOD data can significantly improve the detection\nperformance of existing RSIOD models, i.e., the mAP metrics on DIOR, DIOR-R,\nand HRSC datasets are improved by 3.7%, 4.3%, and 2.43%, respectively.

While text radiology\nreports contain the most relevant clinical information from the image findings,\nthe difficulty of mapping across different modalities has limited the\nfactuality of conventional direct DWI-to-report generation methods. Here, we\npropose paired image-domain retrieval and text-domain augmentation (PIRTA), a\ncross-modal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for providing\nclinician-interpretative AIS radiology reports with improved factuality. PIRTA\nmitigates the need for learning cross-modal mapping, which poses difficulty in\nimage-to-text generation, by casting the cross-modal mapping problem as an\nin-domain retrieval of similar DWI images that have paired ground-truth text\nradiology reports. By exploiting the retrieved radiology reports to augment the\nreport generation process of the query image, we show by experiments with\nextensive in-house and public datasets that PIRTA can accurately retrieve\nrelevant reports from 3D DWI images.

    "abstract": "Driven by the remarkable progress in diffusion models, text-to-image\ngeneration has made significant strides, creating a pressing demand for\nautomatic quality evaluation of generated images. Current state-of-the-art\nautomatic evaluation methods heavily rely on Multi-modal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs), particularly powerful commercial models like GPT-4o. While these\nmodels are highly effective, their substantial costs limit scalability in\nlarge-scale evaluations. Adopting open-source MLLMs is an alternative; however,\ntheir performance falls short due to significant limitations in processing\nmulti-modal data compared to commercial MLLMs. To tackle these problems, we\nfirst propose a task decomposition evaluation framework based on GPT-4o to\nautomatically construct a new training dataset, where the complex evaluation\ntask is decoupled into simpler sub-tasks, effectively reducing the learning\ncomplexity. Based on this dataset, we design innovative training strategies to\neffectively distill GPT-4o's evaluation capabilities into a 7B open-source\nMLLM, MiniCPM-V-2.6. Furthermore, to reliably and comprehensively assess prior\nworks and our proposed model, we manually annotate a meta-evaluation benchmark\nthat includes chain-of-thought explanations alongside quality scores for\ngenerated images. Experimental results demonstrate that our distilled\nopen-source MLLM significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art\nGPT-4o-base baseline, VIEScore, with over 4.6\\% improvement in Spearman and\nKendall correlations with human judgments.",

    "abstract": "Speech-driven gesture generation using transformer-based generative models\nrepresents a rapidly advancing area within virtual human creation. However,\nexisting models face significant challenges due to their quadratic time and\nspace complexities, limiting scalability and efficiency. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce DiM-Gestor, an innovative end-to-end generative model\nleveraging the Mamba-2 architecture. DiM-Gestor features a dual-component\nframework: (1) a fuzzy feature extractor and (2) a speech-to-gesture mapping\nmodule, both built on the Mamba-2. The fuzzy feature extractor, integrated with\na Chinese Pre-trained Model and Mamba-2, autonomously extracts implicit,\ncontinuous speech features. These features are synthesized into a unified\nlatent representation and then processed by the speech-to-gesture mapping\nmodule. This module employs an Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN)-enhanced\nMamba-2 mechanism to uniformly apply transformations across all sequence\ntokens. This enables precise modeling of the nuanced interplay between speech\nfeatures and gesture dynamics. We utilize a diffusion model to train and infer\ndiverse gesture outputs. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations\nconducted on the newly released Chinese Co-Speech Gestures dataset corroborate\nthe efficacy of our proposed model. Compared with Transformer-based\narchitecture, the assessments reveal that our approach delivers competitive\nresults and significantly reduces memory usage, approximately 2.4 times, and\nenhances inference speeds by 2 to 4 times. Additionally, we released the CCG\ndataset, a Chinese Co-Speech Gestures dataset, comprising 15.97 hours (six\nstyles across five scenarios) of 3D full-body skeleton gesture motion performed\nby professional Chinese TV broadcasters.",

    "abstract": "Weather and climate forecasting is vital for sectors such as agriculture and\ndisaster management. Although numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems have\nadvanced, forecasting at the subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) scale, spanning 2 to\n6 weeks, remains challenging due to the chaotic and sparse atmospheric signals\nat this interval. Even state-of-the-art deep learning models struggle to\noutperform simple climatology models in this domain. This paper identifies that\noptimization, instead of network structure, could be the root cause of this\nperformance gap, and then we develop a novel multi-stage optimization strategy\nto close the gap. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that our multi-stage\noptimization approach significantly improves key skill metrics, PCC and TCC,\nwhile utilizing the same backbone structure, surpassing the state-of-the-art\nNWP systems (ECMWF-S2S) by over \\textbf{19-91\\%}. Our research contests the\nrecent study that direct forecasting outperforms rolling forecasting for S2S\ntasks. Through theoretical analysis, we propose that the underperformance of\nrolling forecasting may arise from the accumulation of Jacobian matrix products\nduring training. Our multi-stage framework can be viewed as a form of teacher\nforcing to address this issue. Code is available at\n\\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Baguan-S2S-23E7/}",

Computations are performed for parameters\ntypical of flows over high-pressure turbine blades, where the G\\\"ortler number,\na measure of the curvature effects, and the disturbance Reynolds number, a\nmeasure of the nonlinear effects, are order-one quantities. At moderate\nintensities of the free-stream disturbances, increasing the G\\\"ortler number\nrenders the boundary layer more unstable, while increasing the Mach number or\nthe frequency stabilises the flow. As the free-stream disturbances become more\nintense, vortices over concave surfaces no longer develop into the\ncharacteristic mushroom-shaped structures, while the flow over convex surfaces\nis destabilised. An occurrence map identifies G\\\"ortler vortices or streaks for\ndifferent levels of free-stream disturbances and G\\\"ortler numbers.

Consequently, in recent times research in the area of\nMachine Unlearning (MUL) has become active, the main idea is to force LLMs to\nforget (unlearn) certain information (e.g., PII) without suffering from\nperformance loss on regular tasks. In this work, we examine the robustness of\nthe existing MUL techniques for their ability to enable leakage-proof\nforgetting in LLMs. In particular, we examine the effect of data transformation\non forgetting, i.e., is an unlearned LLM able to recall forgotten information\nif there is a change in the format of the input? Our findings on the TOFU\ndataset highlight the necessity of using diverse data formats to quantify\nunlearning in LLMs more reliably.",

We introduced the edge bending algorithm that deforms a\npolyhedral tiling into a soft tiling and we proved that an infinite class of\npolyhedral tilings can be smoothly deformed into standard soft tilings. Here,\nwe demonstrate that certain triply periodic minimal surfaces naturally give\nrise to non-standard soft tilings. By extending the edge-bending algorithm, we\nfurther establish that the soft tilings derived from the Schwarz P and Schwarz\nD surfaces can be continuously transformed into one another through a\none-parameter family of intermediate non-standard soft tilings. Notably, by\ncarrying its combinatorial structure, both resulting tilings belong to the\nfirst order equivalence class of the Dirichlet-Voronoi tiling on the\nbody-centered cubic bcc lattice, highlighting a deep geometric connection\nunderlying these minimal surface configurations. By requiring identical\nend-tangents for edges in a first order class, we also define second order\nequivalence classes among tilings and prove that there exist exactly two such\nclasses among soft tilings which share the full symmetry group of the DV-bcc\ntiling. Additionally, we construct a one-parameter family of tilings bridging\nstandard and non-standard soft tilings, explicitly including the classic Kelvin\nfoam structure as an intermediate configuration. This construction highlights\nthat both the soft cells themselves and the geometric methods employed in their\ngeneration provide valuable insights into the structural principles underlying\nnatural forms.

Although recent advances\nin one of the common downstream tasks, code generation, have shown promise by\nintroducing translated benchmarks using different methodologies, there is a\ncurrent lack of empirical evidence assessing these benchmarks. To address this\ngap, we conducted a preliminary study to evaluate the performance of\nPoly-Coder, a pioneering open-source, multilingual CLM built for code\ngeneration.

Accordingly, it is preferable to reduce the\nnumber of breaks in a tournament. A common approach is first to construct a\nschedule and then determine a home-away assignment based on the given schedule\nto minimize the number of breaks (first-schedule-then-break). In this study, we\nconcentrate on the problem that arises in the second stage of the\nfirst-schedule-then-break approach, namely, the break minimization\nproblem(BMP). We prove that this problem can be reduced to an odd cycle\ntransversal problem, the well-studied graph problem. These results lead to a\nnew approximation algorithm for the BMP.",

However, due\nto systematic biases in evaluation datasets, the real-world effectiveness of\nthese models remains unclear, particularly across geographies. We introduce\nHateDay, the first global hate speech dataset representative of social media\nsettings, constructed from a random sample of all tweets posted on September\n21, 2022 and covering eight languages and four English-speaking countries.\nUsing HateDay, we uncover substantial variation in the prevalence and\ncomposition of hate speech across languages and regions.

We argue that poor model performance makes public models\nill-suited for automatic hate speech moderation and find that high moderation\nrates are only achievable with substantial human oversight.

With the accumulation of drug-target\ninteraction (DTI) data from experimental studies, leveraging modern\nmachine-learning techniques to discern patterns between drugs and target\nproteins has become increasingly feasible. In this paper, we introduce the\nMulti-channel Interaction Network (MIN), a novel framework designed to predict\nDTIs through two primary components: a representation learning module and a\nmulti-channel interaction module. The representation learning module features a\nC-Score Predictor-assisted screening mechanism, which selects critical residues\nto enhance prediction accuracy and reduce noise. The multi-channel interaction\nmodule incorporates a structure-agnostic channel, a structure-aware channel,\nand an extended-mixture channel, facilitating the identification of interaction\npatterns at various levels for optimal complementarity. Additionally,\ncontrastive learning is utilized to harmonize the representations of diverse\ndata types. Our experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that\nMIN surpasses other strong DTI prediction methods. Furthermore, the case study\nreveals a high overlap between the residues selected by the C-Score Predictor\nand those in actual binding pockets, underscoring MIN's explainability\ncapability.

This\nmulti-step process allows us to create a rich, varied dataset that captures the\nnuances of Hindi speech and facial expressions, providing a robust foundation\nfor training and evaluating deepfake detection models in a Hindi language\ncontext. It is unique of its kind as all of the previous datasets contain\neither deepfake videos or synthesized audio.

Carbon oxides, such as CO and CO2, and\ntheir photochemical products are anticipated to serve as vital radiative\ncooling sources not only in atmospheres dominated by carbon oxides but also in\nH2-rich atmospheres. However, their specific effects on the hydrodynamic\nescape, especially in H2-rich atmospheres, have been inadequately investigated.\nIn this study, we conduct 1-D hydrodynamic escape simulations for H2-rich\natmospheres incorporating CO, CO2, and their chemical products on an Earth-mass\nplanet. We consider detailed radiative cooling processes and chemical networks\nrelated to carbon oxides to elucidate their impacts on the hydrodynamic escape.\nIn the escape outflow, CO2 undergoes rapid photolysis, producing CO and atomic\noxygen, while CO exhibits photochemical stability compared to CO2. The H2\noxidation by atomic oxygen results in the production of OH and H2O.\nConsequently, the hydrodynamic escape is significantly suppressed by the\nradiative cooling effects of CO, H2O, OH, and H3+ even when the basal mixing\nfraction of CO and CO2 is lower than ~0.01. These mechanisms extend the\nlifetime of H2-rich atmospheres by about one order of magnitude compared to the\ncase of pure hydrogen atmospheres on early Earth, which also results in\nnegligible escape of heavier carbon- and nitrogen-bearing molecules and noble\ngases.",

Using\nsubstances that do not respond the same to identical inputs (e.g., a real\nspin-torque oscillator), we propose mechanisms aimed at obtaining a reliable\noutput and show that processed inputs in the unconventional substance are\nretrievable. Finally, we demonstrate that, based on our framework,\nspatiotemporal chaos, which is thought to be unusable as a computational\nresource, can be used to emulate complex nonlinear dynamics, including large\nscale spatiotemporal chaos.

    "abstract": "In this technical report, we establish the asymptotic stability of MPC under\nplant-model mismatch for problems where the origin remains a steady state\ndespite mismatch. This class of problems includes, but is not limited to,\ninventory management, path-planning, and control of systems in deviation\nvariables. Our results differ from prior results on the inherent robustness of\nMPC, which guarantee only convergence to a neighborhood of the origin, the size\nof which scales with the magnitude of the mismatch. For MPC with quadratic\ncosts, continuous differentiability of the system dynamics is sufficient to\ndemonstrate exponential stability of the closed-loop system despite mismatch.\nFor MPC with general costs, a joint comparison function bound and scaling\ncondition guarantee asymptotic stability despite mismatch. The results are\nillustrated in numerical simulations, including the classic upright pendulum\nproblem. The tools developed to establish these results can address the\nstability of offset-free MPC, an open and interesting question in the MPC\nresearch literature.",

In this paper, we question the reliability of backdoor\nwatermarks and re-examine them from the perspective of attackers.

Specifically, to\nachieve alignment between audio and facial expression representation spaces, we\npresent a Diffusion-based Co-speech Temporal Expansion (Di-CTE) module within\nV-AID to generate expression-related representations under multi-source emotion\ncondition constraints. Then we propose a well-designed Emotional Talking Head\nDiffusion (ETHD) backbone to efficiently generate highly expressive talking\nhead videos, which contains an Expression Decoupling Injection (EDI) module to\nautomatically decouple the expressions from reference portraits while\nintegrating the target expression information, achieving more expressive\ngeneration performance. Experimental results show that EmotiveTalk can generate\nexpressive talking head videos, ensuring the promised controllability of\nemotions and stability during long-time generation, yielding state-of-the-art\nperformance compared to existing methods.",

Recent advancements\nhave made it possible to generate relevant audios from inputs describing an\naudio scene, such as images or texts. However, the immersiveness and\nexpressiveness of the generation are limited. One possible problem is that\nexisting methods solely rely on the global scene and overlook details of local\nsounding objects (i.e., sound sources). To address this issue, we propose a\nSound Source-Aware Audio (SS2A) generator. SS2A is able to locally perceive\nmultimodal sound sources from a scene with visual detection and cross-modality\ntranslation. It then contrastively learns a Cross-Modal Sound Source (CMSS)\nManifold to semantically disambiguate each source. Finally, we attentively mix\ntheir CMSS semantics into a rich audio representation, from which a pretrained\naudio generator outputs the sound. To model the CMSS manifold, we curate a\nnovel single-sound-source visual-audio dataset VGGS3 from VGGSound. We also\ndesign a Sound Source Matching Score to clearly measure localized audio\nrelevance. With the effectiveness of explicit sound source modeling, SS2A\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in extensive image-to-audio tasks. We\nalso qualitatively demonstrate SS2A's ability to achieve intuitive synthesis\ncontrol by compositing vision, text, and audio conditions.

We propose freePruner, a\ntraining-free token reduction approach that can be directly applied to any\nopen-source LMM without additional training. Unlike existing methods that rely\nheavily on token merging operations, freePruner employs a two-stage token\nselection strategy: (1) identifying pivotal tokens that capture high-level\nsemantic information using our designed contribution degree metric, and (2)\nselecting complementary tokens that preserve essential low-level visual details\nthrough attention pattern analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nfreePruner achieves 2x acceleration while maintaining comparable performance\nacross mainstream visual question-answering benchmarks in the training-free\nsetting. Moreover, freePruner is orthogonal to and can be combined with other\npost-training acceleration techniques, such as post-training quantization,\nproviding a practical solution for efficient LMM deployment.",

This phenomenon is particularly important in\nparticle physics, notably in Quantum Chromodynamics, and plays a crucial role\nin condensed matter physics. However, achieving a theoretical understanding of\nthis non-perturbative effect is challenging, as conventional numerical\napproaches often fall short and require substantial computational resources. On\nthe experimental side, studying these effects necessitates advanced setups,\nsuch as high-energy colliders, which makes direct observation difficult. Here,\nwe report an experimental investigation of the string breaking mechanism in a\none-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory using an optical lattice quantum\nsimulator. By deterministically preparing initial states of varying lengths\nwith fixed charges at each end, and adiabatically tuning the mass and string\ntension, we observed in situ microscopic confined phases that exhibit either\nstring or brokenstring states. Further analysis reveals that string breaking\noccurs under a resonance condition, leading to the creation of new\nparticle-antiparticle pairs.

    "abstract": "The dynamics of capillary rise under different geometric and fluid conditions\nhave the common signatures of rapid rise followed by an equilibrium state that\ndescribe the underlying competing forces. We present a new interpretation of\ncapillary dynamics using a linear damped system where modulation of damping and\nforcing characteristics are achieved using axisymmetric channels with\nsinusoidal variation in radius. The complete axisymmetric design space ranging\nfrom hydrophilic channels that enable spontaneous imbibition to hydrophobic\nchannels, that required external pressure mechanisms is modeled and the force\ndynamics is split into simultaneous damping and forcing characteristics. We\nintroduce the product of damping and forcing terms as the new parameter that\neffectively characterizes rise dynamics across various geometric and flow\nconditions, encompassing both flow-enhancing and flow-inhibiting scenarios. The\nmonotonic nature of this parameter enables the development of a stochastic\noptimization method that can determine optimal channel geometries for\ncontrolled capillary rise.",

    "abstract": "Object detectors, which are widely used in real-world applications, are\nvulnerable to backdoor attacks. This vulnerability arises because many users\nrely on datasets or pre-trained models provided by third parties due to\nconstraints on data and resources. However, most research on backdoor attacks\nhas focused on image classification, with limited investigation into object\ndetection. Furthermore, the triggers for most existing backdoor attacks on\nobject detection are manually generated, requiring prior knowledge and\nconsistent patterns between the training and inference stages. This approach\nmakes the attacks either easy to detect or difficult to adapt to various\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose novel twin trigger\ngenerative networks in the frequency domain to generate invisible triggers for\nimplanting stealthy backdoors into models during training, and visible triggers\nfor steady activation during inference, making the attack process difficult to\ntrace. Specifically, for the invisible trigger generative network, we deploy a\nGaussian smoothing layer and a high-frequency artifact classifier to enhance\nthe stealthiness of backdoor implantation in object detectors. For the visible\ntrigger generative network, we design a novel alignment loss to optimize the\nvisible triggers so that they differ from the original patterns but still align\nwith the malicious activation behavior of the invisible triggers. Extensive\nexperimental results and analyses prove the possibility of using different\ntriggers in the training stage and the inference stage, and demonstrate the\nattack effectiveness of our proposed visible trigger and invisible trigger\ngenerative networks, significantly reducing the mAP_0.5 of the object detectors\nby 70.0% and 84.5%, including YOLOv5 and YOLOv7 with different settings,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Embedding models have become essential tools in both natural language\nprocessing and computer vision, enabling efficient semantic search,\nrecommendation, clustering, and more. However, the high memory and\ncomputational demands of full-precision embeddings pose challenges for\ndeployment in resource-constrained environments, such as real-time\nrecommendation systems. In this work, we propose a novel finetuning framework\nto ternary-weight embedding models, which reduces memory and computational\noverhead while maintaining high performance. To apply ternarization to\npre-trained embedding models, we introduce self-taught knowledge distillation\nto finalize the ternary-weights of the linear layers. With extensive\nexperiments on public text and vision datasets, we demonstrated that without\nsacrificing effectiveness, the ternarized model consumes low memory usage and\nhas low latency in the inference stage with great efficiency. In practical\nimplementations, embedding models are typically integrated with Approximate\nNearest Neighbor (ANN) search. Our experiments combining ternary embedding with\nANN search yielded impressive improvement in both accuracy and computational\nefficiency. The repository is available at here.",

In\nthis paper, we propose ConsistentAvatar, a novel framework for fully consistent\nand high-fidelity talking avatar generation. Instead of directly employing\nmulti-modal conditions to the diffusion process, our method learns to first\nmodel the temporal representation for stability between adjacent frames.\nSpecifically, we propose a Temporally-Sensitive Detail (TSD) map containing\nhigh-frequency feature and contours that vary significantly along the time\naxis. Using a temporal consistent diffusion module, we learn to align TSD of\nthe initial result to that of the video frame ground truth. The final avatar is\ngenerated by a fully consistent diffusion module, conditioned on the aligned\nTSD, rough head normal, and emotion prompt embedding. We find that the aligned\nTSD, which represents the temporal patterns, constrains the diffusion process\nto generate temporally stable talking head. Further, its reliable guidance\ncomplements the inaccuracy of other conditions, suppressing the accumulated\nerror while improving the consistency on various aspects. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that ConsistentAvatar outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on\nthe generated appearance, 3D, expression and temporal consistency.

Firstly, we use the\nattention lens to identify the stages at which LVLMs handle visual data,\ndiscovering that the middle layers are crucial. Moreover, we find that these\nlayers can be further divided into two stages: ''visual information\nenrichment'' and ''semantic refinement'' which respectively propagate visual\ndata to object tokens and interpret it through text. By analyzing attention\npatterns during the visual information enrichment stage, we find that real\ntokens consistently receive higher attention weights than hallucinated ones,\nserving as a strong indicator of hallucination. Further examination of\nmulti-head attention maps reveals that hallucination tokens often result from\nheads interacting with inconsistent objects. Based on these insights, we\npropose a simple inference-time method that adjusts visual attention by\nintegrating information across various heads.

Then, we present a quantitative approach to assessing network\ncapacity in relation to an unreliable ISL model (cap-uISL), and a Constrained\nPath Expansion throughput calculation method (THP-CPE) based on a set of known\ntraffic paths. This method allows us to obtain the current throughput value of\nthe network based on any given traffic paths and load demand matrix. As the\ntraffic load increases, the throughput approaches its maximum value, which is\nnotably smaller than the network's capacity.\n  We experimentally determine the network capacity of CAP-uISL under various\nlink parameters and compare our throughput quantization method, THP-CPE, with\nother state-of-the-art methods under four emerging ISTNs. We find that,\ncompared with the THP-CPE, existing throughput calculation methods tend to be\noverestimated, while our proposed throughput calculation method maintains\nreasonable intervals in terms of path utilization ($<1$) under all load cases.",

Conversely, nanofluids showed limited ability to modify interfacial\nforces. At lower interfacial tensions (6.5 mN/m for surfactants, 15.6 mN/m for\nnanofluids), both systems displayed similar displacement efficiencies and\nfingering patterns, driven by distinct mechanisms: capillary instability for\nsurfactants and expansive layer flow for nanofluids. These findings challenge\nthe assumption that nanofluids rely primarily on interfacial tension reduction\nfor enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and highlight the need to refine our\nunderstanding of nanoparticle interfacial activities. Future studies should\nextend these insights to core-scale experiments for a more comprehensive\nevaluation of two-phase flow dynamics.",

MoE models are typically trained in a distributed\nmanner with an expert parallelism scheme, where experts in each MoE layer are\ndistributed across multiple GPUs. However, the default expert parallelism\nsuffers from the heavy network burden due to the all-to-all intermediate data\nexchange among GPUs before and after the expert run. Some existing works have\nproposed to reduce intermediate data exchanges by transferring experts to\nreduce the network loads, however, which would decrease parallelism level of\nexpert execution and make computation inefficient. The weaknesses of existing\nworks motivate us to explore whether it is possible to reduce inter-GPU traffic\nwhile maintaining a high degree of expert parallelism. This paper gives a\npositive response by presenting Luffy, a communication-efficient distributed\nMoE training system with two new techniques. First, Luffy migrates sequences\namong GPUs to hide heavy token pulling paths within GPUs and avoid copying\nexperts over GPUs. Second, we propose token condensation that identifies\nsimilar tokens and then eliminates redundant transmissions.

    "abstract": "The advent of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced\nmultimodal tasks, enabling more sophisticated and accurate reasoning across\nvarious applications, including image and video captioning, visual question\nanswering, and cross-modal retrieval. Despite their superior capabilities, VLMs\nstruggle with fine-grained image regional composition information perception.\nSpecifically, they have difficulty accurately aligning the segmentation masks\nwith the corresponding semantics and precisely describing the compositional\naspects of the referred regions.\n  However, compositionality - the ability to understand and generate novel\ncombinations of known visual and textual components - is critical for\nfacilitating coherent reasoning and understanding across modalities by VLMs. To\naddress this issue, we propose FINECAPTION, a novel VLM that can recognize\narbitrary masks as referential inputs and process high-resolution images for\ncompositional image captioning at different granularity levels. To support this\nendeavor, we introduce COMPOSITIONCAP, a new dataset for multi-grained region\ncompositional image captioning, which introduces the task of compositional\nattribute-aware regional image captioning.\n  Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model\ncompared to other state-of-the-art VLMs. Additionally, we analyze the\ncapabilities of current VLMs in recognizing various visual prompts for\ncompositional region image captioning, highlighting areas for improvement in\nVLM design and training.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel approach for fluid dynamic simulations by\nharnessing the capabilities of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) guided\nby the newly unveiled principle of minimum pressure gradient (PMPG). In a PINN\nformulation, the physics problem is converted into a minimization problem\n(typically least squares). The PMPG asserts that for incompressible flows, the\ntotal magnitude of the pressure gradient over the domain must be minimum at\nevery time instant, turning fluid mechanics into minimization problems, making\nit an excellent choice for PINNs formulation. Following the PMPG, the proposed\nPINN formulation seeks to construct a neural network for the flow field that\nminimizes Nature's cost function for incompressible flows in contrast to\ntraditional PINNs that minimize the residuals of the Navier-Stokes equations.\nThis technique eliminates the need to train a separate pressure model, thereby\nreducing training time and computational costs. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this approach through a case study of inviscid flow around a\ncylinder, showing its ability to capture the underlying physics, while reducing\ncomputational cost and training time. The proposed approach outperforms the\ntraditional PINNs approach in terms of Root Mean Square Error, training time,\nconvergence rate, and compliance with physical metrics. While demonstrated on a\nsimple geometry, the methodology is extendable to more complex flow fields\n(e.g., Three-Dimensional, unsteady, viscous flows) within the incompressible\nrealm, which is the region of applicability of the PMPG.",

Combined with the inherent low power benefits, this\nleads to a 3.4x improvement in energy compared to the full-precision version.\nSecondly, direct coding outperforms rate coding, achieving a 10% improvement in\naccuracy and consuming 26.4x less energy per image.

Existing defenses, such as input preprocessing,\nadversarial training, and response evaluation-based methods, are often\nimpractical for real-world deployment due to their high costs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose ASTRA, an efficient and effective defense by adaptively\nsteering models away from adversarial feature directions to resist VLM attacks.\nOur key procedures involve finding transferable steering vectors representing\nthe direction of harmful response and applying adaptive activation steering to\nremove these directions at inference time. To create effective steering\nvectors, we randomly ablate the visual tokens from the adversarial images and\nidentify those most strongly associated with jailbreaks. These tokens are then\nused to construct steering vectors. During inference, we perform the adaptive\nsteering method that involves the projection between the steering vectors and\ncalibrated activation, resulting in little performance drops on benign inputs\nwhile strongly avoiding harmful outputs under adversarial inputs. Extensive\nexperiments across multiple models and baselines demonstrate our\nstate-of-the-art performance and high efficiency in mitigating jailbreak risks.\nAdditionally, ASTRA exhibits good transferability, defending against unseen\nattacks (i.e., structured-based attack, perturbation-based attack with project\ngradient descent variants, and text-only attack).

    "abstract": "The advanced function-calling capabilities of foundation models open up new\npossibilities for deploying agents to perform complex API tasks. However,\nmanaging large amounts of data and interacting with numerous APIs makes\nfunction calling hardware-intensive and costly, especially on edge devices.\nCurrent Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with function calling at the edge\nbecause they cannot handle complex inputs or manage multiple tools effectively.\nThis results in low task-completion accuracy, increased delays, and higher\npower consumption. In this work, we introduce Less-is-More, a novel\nfine-tuning-free function-calling scheme for dynamic tool selection. Our\napproach is based on the key insight that selectively reducing the number of\ntools available to LLMs significantly improves their function-calling\nperformance, execution time, and power efficiency on edge devices. Experimental\nresults with state-of-the-art LLMs on edge hardware show agentic success rate\nimprovements, with execution time reduced by up to 70% and power consumption by\nup to 40%.",

    "abstract": "Statistical inference often conflates the probability of a parameter with the\nprobability of a hypothesis, a critical misunderstanding termed the ultimate\nissue error. This error is pervasive across the social, biological, and medical\nsciences, where null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is mistakenly\nunderstood to be testing hypotheses rather than evaluating parameter estimates.\nHere, we advocate for using the Weight of Evidence (WoE) approach, which\nintegrates quantitative data with qualitative background information for more\naccurate and transparent inference. Through a detailed example involving the\nrelationship between vitamin D (25-hydroxy vitamin D) levels and COVID-19 risk,\nwe demonstrate how WoE quantifies support for hypotheses while accounting for\nstudy design biases, power, and confounding factors. These findings emphasise\nthe necessity of combining statistical metrics with contextual evaluation.

Despite\nrecent progresses in measuring and mitigating social and algorithmic biases in\nAI and large language models (LLMs), it is not clear to what extent LLMs behave\n\"rationally\", or if they are also vulnerable to human cognitive bias triggers.\nTo address this open problem, our study, consisting of a crowdsourcing user\nexperiment and a LLM-enabled simulation experiment, compared the credibility\nassessments by LLM and human judges under potential decoy effects in an\ninformation retrieval (IR) setting, and empirically examined the extent to\nwhich LLMs are cognitively biased in COVID-19 medical (mis)information\nassessment tasks compared to traditional human assessors as a baseline. The\nresults, collected from a between-subject user experiment and a LLM-enabled\nreplicate experiment, demonstrate that 1) Larger and more recent LLMs tend to\nshow a higher level of consistency and accuracy in distinguishing credible\ninformation from misinformation. However, they are more likely to give higher\nratings for misinformation due to the presence of a more salient, decoy\nmisinformation result; 2) While decoy effect occurred in both human and LLM\nassessments, the effect is more prevalent across different conditions and\ntopics in LLM judgments compared to human credibility ratings. In contrast to\nthe generally assumed \"rationality\" of AI tools, our study empirically confirms\nthe cognitive bias risks embedded in LLM agents, evaluates the decoy impact on\nLLMs against human credibility assessments, and thereby highlights the\ncomplexity and importance of debiasing AI agents and developing\npsychology-informed AI audit techniques and policies for automated judgment\ntasks and beyond.",

    "abstract": "P300 speller BCIs allow users to compose sentences by selecting target keys\non a GUI through the detection of P300 component in their EEG signals following\nvisual stimuli. Most P300 speller BCIs require users to spell words letter by\nletter, or the first few initial letters, resulting in high keystroke demands\nthat increase time, cognitive load, and fatigue. This highlights the need for\nmore efficient, user-friendly methods for faster sentence composition. In this\nwork, we introduce ChatBCI, a P300 speller BCI that leverages the zero-shot\nlearning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to suggest words from\nuser-spelled initial letters or predict the subsequent word(s), reducing\nkeystrokes and accelerating sentence composition. ChatBCI retrieves word\nsuggestions through remote queries to the GPT-3.5 API. A new GUI, displaying\nGPT-3.5 word suggestions as extra keys is designed. SWLDA is used for the P300\nclassification. Seven subjects completed two online spelling tasks: 1)\ncopy-spelling a self-composed sentence using ChatBCI, and 2) improvising a\nsentence using ChatBCI's word suggestions. Results demonstrate that in Task 1,\non average, ChatBCI outperforms letter-by-letter BCI spellers, reducing time\nand keystrokes by 62.14% and 53.22%, respectively, and increasing information\ntransfer rate by 198.96%. In Task 2, ChatBCI achieves 80.68% keystroke savings\nand a record 8.53 characters/min for typing speed. Overall, ChatBCI, by\nemploying remote LLM queries, enhances sentence composition in realistic\nscenarios, significantly outperforming traditional spellers without requiring\nlocal model training or storage. ChatBCI's (multi-) word predictions, combined\nwith its new GUI, pave the way for developing next-generation speller BCIs that\nare efficient and effective for real-time communication, especially for users\nwith communication and motor disabilities.",

The problem has\nbeen previously modeled and studied as a graph editing problem, namely Cluster\nEditing, which assumes that closely related data elements must be adjacent. As\nsuch, the main objective (of the Cluster Editing problem) is to turn clusters\ninto cliques as a way to identify them. This is to be obtained via two main\nedge editing operations: additions and deletions. There are two problems with\nthe Cluster Editing model that we seek to address in this paper. First,\n``closely'' related does not necessarily mean ``directly'' related. So\ncloseness should be measured by relatively short distance. As such, we seek to\nturn clusters into (sub)graphs of small diameter. Second, in real applications,\na data element can belong, or have roles, in multiple groups. In some cases,\nwithout allowing data elements to belong to more than one cluster each, makes\nit hard to achieve any clustering via classical partition-based methods.

The article sketches the essential\nsteps of the intellectual journey going from the first applications of quantum\nnotions and formalisms to human cognition to the proposal of a potentially\ngroundbreaking interpretation of quantum mechanics, offering profound\nexplanations for major quantum phenomena. This was done by drawing numerous\nparallels with the human conceptual domain and suggesting the existence of a\nlevel of cognitive activity that would underlie our physical reality.

They are known to generate wide variations in sampled images,\nalbeit with a trade-off in image fidelity. Guided sampling methods, such as\nclassifier guidance (CG) and classifier-free guidance (CFG), focus sampling in\nwell-learned high-probability regions to generate images of high fidelity, but\neach has its limitations. CG is computationally expensive due to the use of\nback-propagation for classifier gradient descent, while CFG, being\ngradient-free, is more efficient but compromises class label alignment compared\nto CG. In this work, we propose an efficient guidance method that fully\nutilizes a pre-trained classifier without using gradient descent. By using the\nclassifier solely in inference mode, a time-adaptive reference class label and\ncorresponding guidance scale are determined at each time step for guided\nsampling. Experiments on both class-conditioned and text-to-image generation\ndiffusion models demonstrate that the proposed Gradient-free Classifier\nGuidance (GFCG) method consistently improves class prediction accuracy. We also\nshow GFCG to be complementary to other guided sampling methods like CFG. When\ncombined with the state-of-the-art Autoguidance (ATG), without additional\ncomputational overhead, it enhances image fidelity while preserving diversity.\nFor ImageNet 512$\\times$512, we achieve a record $\\text{FD}_{\\text{DINOv2}}$ of\n23.09, while simultaneously attaining a higher classification Precision (94.3%)\ncompared to ATG (90.2%)",

In this paper,\nwe propose a contrast- and resolution-agnostic method for claustrum\nsegmentation at ultra-high resolution (0.35 mm isotropic); the method is based\non the SynthSeg segmentation framework (Billot et al., 2023), which leverages\nthe use of synthetic training intensity images to achieve excellent\ngeneralization. In particular, SynthSeg requires only label maps to be trained,\nsince corresponding intensity images are synthesized on the fly with random\ncontrast and resolution. We trained a deep learning network for automatic\nclaustrum segmentation, using claustrum manual labels obtained from 18\nultra-high resolution MRI scans (mostly ex vivo). We demonstrated the method to\nwork on these 18 high resolution cases (Dice score = 0.632, mean surface\ndistance = 0.458 mm, and volumetric similarity = 0.867 using 6-fold Cross\nValidation (CV)), and also on in vivo T1-weighted MRI scans at typical\nresolutions (~1 mm isotropic). We also demonstrated that the method is robust\nin a test-retest setting and when applied to multimodal imaging (T2-weighted,\nProton Density and quantitative T1 scans). To the best of our knowledge this is\nthe first accurate method for automatic ultra-high resolution claustrum\nsegmentation, which is robust against changes in contrast and resolution. The\nmethod is released at https://github.com/chiara-mauri/claustrum_segmentation\nand as part of the neuroimaging package Freesurfer (Fischl, 2012).",

    "abstract": "As LLMs continue to become more powerful and versatile, human evaluation has\nquickly become intractable at scale and reliance on automatic metrics has\nbecome the norm. Recently, it has been shown that LLMs are themselves\nstate-of-the-art evaluators for many tasks. These Autoraters are typically\ndesigned so that they generalize to new systems and test sets. In practice,\nhowever, evaluation is performed on a small set of fixed, canonical test sets,\nwhich are carefully curated to measure certain capabilities of interest and are\nnot changed frequently. In this work, we design a method which specializes a\nprompted Autorater to a given test set, by leveraging historical ratings on the\ntest set to construct in-context learning (ICL) examples. We evaluate our\nSpecialist method on the task of fine-grained machine translation evaluation,\nand show that it dramatically outperforms the state-of-the-art XCOMET metric by\n54% and 119% on the WMT'23 and WMT'24 test sets, respectively. We perform\nextensive analyses to understand the representations learned by our Specialist\nmetrics, and how variability in rater behavior affects their performance. We\nalso verify the generalizability and robustness of our Specialist method for\ndesigning automatic metrics across different numbers of ICL examples, LLM\nbackbones, systems to evaluate, and evaluation tasks.",

    "abstract": "LoRA has emerged as one of the de facto methods for fine-tuning foundation\nmodels with low computational cost and memory footprint. The idea is to only\ntrain a low-rank perturbation to the weights of a pre-trained model, given\nsupervised data for a downstream task. Despite its empirical sucess, from a\nmathematical perspective it remains poorly understood what learning mechanisms\nensure that gradient descent converges to useful low-rank perturbations.\n  In this work we study low-rank fine-tuning in a student-teacher setting. We\nare given the weights of a two-layer base model $f$, as well as i.i.d. samples\n$(x,f^*(x))$ where $x$ is Gaussian and $f^*$ is the teacher model given by\nperturbing the weights of $f$ by a rank-1 matrix. This generalizes the setting\nof generalized linear model (GLM) regression where the weights of $f$ are zero.\n  When the rank-1 perturbation is comparable in norm to the weight matrix of\n$f$, the training dynamics are nonlinear. Nevertheless, in this regime we prove\nunder mild assumptions that a student model which is initialized at the base\nmodel and trained with online gradient descent will converge to the teacher in\n$dk^{O(1)}$ iterations, where $k$ is the number of neurons in $f$. Importantly,\nunlike in the GLM setting, the complexity does not depend on fine-grained\nproperties of the activation's Hermite expansion. We also prove that in our\nsetting, learning the teacher model \"from scratch'' can require significantly\nmore iterations.",
