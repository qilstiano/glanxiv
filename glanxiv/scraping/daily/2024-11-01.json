    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive axiomatization of\nstructure-preserving discretization through the framework of commutative\ndiagrams. By establishing a formal language that captures the essential\nproperties of discretization processes, we provide a rigorous foundation for\nanalyzing how various structures (such as algebraic, geometric, and topological\nfeatures) are maintained during the transition from continuous to discrete\nsettings. Specifically, we establish that the transition from continuous to\ndiscrete differential settings invariably leads to noncommutative structures,\nreinforcing previous observation on the interplay between discretization and\nnoncommutativity. We demonstrate the applicability of our axiomatization by\napplying it to the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization, showing that this\nquantization method adheres to our proposed criteria for structure-preserving\ndiscretization. We establish in this setting a precise limit theorem for the\napproximation of the Laplacian by a sequence of matrix approximations. This\nwork not only enriches the theoretical understanding of the nature of\ndiscretization but also sets the stage for further exploration of its\napplications across various discretization methods.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to a slew of adversarial\nattacks and jailbreaking methods. One common approach employed by white-hat\nattackers, or red-teamers, is to process model inputs and outputs using\nstring-level obfuscations, which can include leetspeak, rotary ciphers, Base64,\nASCII, and more. Our work extends these encoding-based attacks by unifying them\nin a framework of invertible string transformations. With invertibility, we can\ndevise arbitrary string compositions, defined as sequences of transformations,\nthat we can encode and decode end-to-end programmatically. We devise a\nautomated best-of-n attack that samples from a combinatorially large number of\nstring compositions. Our jailbreaks obtain competitive attack success rates on\nseveral leading frontier models when evaluated on HarmBench, highlighting that\nencoding-based attacks remain a persistent vulnerability even in advanced LLMs.",

Multiple commutators of\ndifferent powers of the angular momenta $\\hat{\\bf J}^{2}$ and vector-operator\n$\\hat{\\bf A}$ are determined in the general form. Calculations of the\nexpectation values averaged over orbital angular momenta are also described in\ndetail. This effective and elegant old technique, which was successfully used\nby E. Fermi and A. Bohr, is almost forgotten in modern times. We also discuss\nquantum systems with additional relations (or constraints) between some\nvector-operators and orbital angular momentum. For similar systems such\nrelations allow one to obtain some valuable additional information about their\nproperties, including the bound state spectra, correct asymptotics of actual\nwave functions, etc. As an example of unsolved problems we consider\napplications of the algebras of angular momenta to investigation of the\none-electron, two-center (Coulomb) problem $(Q_1, Q_2)$.

Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically\ninsert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing\nembedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting\nunsafe content.

Spectroscopic techniques like\nX-ray absorption and core-loss electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) are\nsensitive to lattice temperature, but understanding thermal effects is\nnontrivial. This work explores the potential for nanoscale and element-specific\ncore-loss thermometry by comparing the Si L2,3 edge's temperature-dependent\nredshift against plasmon energy expansion thermometry (PEET) in a scanning TEM.\nUsing density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT, and the\nBethe-Salpeter equation, we ab initio model both the Si L2,3 and plasmon\nredshift. We find that the core-loss redshift occurs due to bandgap reduction\nfrom electron-phonon renormalization. Our results indicate that despite lower\ncore-loss signal intensity compared to plasmon features, core-loss thermometry\nhas key advantages and can be more accurate through standard spectral\ndenoising. Specifically, we show that the Varshni equation easily interprets\nthe core-loss redshift for semiconductors, which avoids plasmon spectral\nconvolution for PEET in complex junctions and interfaces. We also find that\ncore-loss thermometry is more accurate than PEET at modeling thermal lattice\nexpansion in semiconductors, unless the specimen's temperature-dependent\ndielectric properties are fully characterized. Furthermore, core-loss\nthermometry has the potential to measure nanoscale heating in multi-component\nmaterials and stacked interfaces with elemental specificity at length scales\nsmaller than the plasmon's wavefunction.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present XST-GCNN (eXplainable Spatio-Temporal Graph\nConvolutional Neural Network), a novel architecture for processing\nheterogeneous and irregular Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data. Our approach\ncaptures temporal and feature dependencies within a unified spatio-temporal\npipeline by leveraging a GCNN that uses a spatio-temporal graph aimed at\noptimizing predictive accuracy and interoperability. For graph estimation, we\nintroduce techniques, including one based on the (heterogeneous) Gower\ndistance. Once estimated, we propose two methods for graph construction: one\nbased on the Cartesian product, treating temporal instants homogeneously, and\nanother spatio-temporal approach with distinct graphs per time step. We also\npropose two GCNN architectures: a standard GCNN with a normalized adjacency\nmatrix and a higher-order polynomial GCNN. In addition to accuracy, we\nemphasize explainability by designing an inherently interpretable model and\nperforming a thorough interpretability analysis, identifying key feature-time\ncombinations that drive predictions. We evaluate XST-GCNN using real-world\nElectronic Health Record data from University Hospital of Fuenlabrada to\npredict Multidrug Resistance (MDR) in ICU patients, a critical healthcare\nchallenge linked to high mortality and complex treatments. Our architecture\noutperforms traditional models, achieving a mean ROC-AUC score of 81.03 +-\n2.43.

Successful outcomes include\ninvisibility cloaks, wavefront shaping protocols, active metasurface\ndevelopment, and more. At their core, these achievements rely on our ability to\nengineer the resonant spectrum of the underlying physical structures which is\nconventionally accomplished by carefully imposing geometrical and/or dynamical\nsymmetries. In contrast, by taking active control over the boundary conditions\nin complex scattering environments which lack artificially-imposed geometric\nsymmetries, we demonstrate via microwave experiments the ability to manipulate\nthe spectrum of the scattering operator. This active control empowers the\ncreation, destruction and repositioning of exceptional point degeneracies\n(EPD's) in a two-dimensional (2D) parameter space. The presence of EPD's\nsignifies a coalescence of the scattering eigenmodes, which dramatically\naffects transport. The scattering EPD's are partitioned in domains\ncharacterized by a binary charge, as well as an integer winding number, are\ntopologically stable in the two-dimensional parameter space, and obey winding\nnumber-conservation laws upon interactions with each other, even in cases where\nLorentz reciprocity is violated; in this case the topological domains are\ndestroyed.

This long-standing software engineering task is crucial for\nmodernizing legacy systems, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, enhancing\nperformance, and more. However, automating this process remains challenging due\nto many syntactic and semantic differences between PLs. Recent studies show\nthat even advanced techniques such as large language models (LLMs), especially\nopen-source LLMs, still struggle with the task. Currently, code LLMs are\ntrained with source code from multiple programming languages, thus presenting\nmultilingual capabilities.\n  In this paper, we investigate whether such multilingual capabilities can be\nharnessed to enhance code translation. To achieve this goal, we introduce\nInterTrans, an LLM-based automated code translation approach that, in contrast\nto existing approaches, leverages intermediate translations across PLs to\nbridge the syntactic and semantic gaps between source and target PLs.\n  InterTrans contains two stages. It first utilizes a novel Tree of Code\nTranslation (ToCT) algorithm to plan transitive intermediate translation\nsequences between a given source and target PL, then validates them in a\nspecific order. We evaluate InterTrans with three open LLMs on three benchmarks\n(i.e., CodeNet, HumanEval-X, and TransCoder) involving six PLs. Results show an\nabsolute improvement between 18.3% to 43.3% in Computation Accuracy (CA) for\nInterTrans over Direct Translation with 10 attempts.

In the quantum nonresonance condition,\nthe disorder in momentum space, induced by the pseudorandom feature of the free\nevolution operator, suppresses the directed current at all times.

The\ndynamical localization can be effectively manipulated by the phase, with\nunderlying physics rooted in the different quasi-eigenenergy spectrum modulated\nby ratchet potential.

    "abstract": "Online competitive action games have flourished as a space for entertainment\nand social connections, yet they face challenges from a small percentage of\nplayers engaging in disruptive behaviors. This study delves into the\nunder-explored realm of understanding the effects of moderation on player\nbehavior within online gaming on an example of a popular title - Call of\nDuty(R): Modern Warfare(R)II. We employ a quasi-experimental design and causal\ninference techniques to examine the impact of moderation in a real-world\nindustry-scale moderation system. We further delve into novel aspects around\nthe impact of delayed moderation, as well as the severity of applied\npunishment. We examine these effects on a set of four disruptive behaviors\nincluding cheating, offensive user name, chat, and voice. Our findings uncover\nthe dual impact moderation has on reducing disruptive behavior and discouraging\ndisruptive players from participating. We further uncover differences in the\neffectiveness of quick and delayed moderation and the varying severity of\npunishment. Our examination of real-world gaming interactions sets a precedent\nin understanding the effectiveness of moderation and its impact on player\nbehavior. Our insights offer actionable suggestions for the most promising\navenues for improving real-world moderation practices, as well as the\nheterogeneous impact moderation has on indifferent players.",

    "abstract": "Building energy modeling plays a vital role in optimizing the operation of\nbuilding energy systems by providing accurate predictions of the building's\nreal-world conditions. In this context, various techniques have been explored,\nranging from traditional physics-based models to data-driven models. Recently,\nresearchers are combining physics-based and data-driven models into hybrid\napproaches. This includes using the physics-based model output as additional\ndata-driven input, learning the residual between physics-based model and real\ndata, learning a surrogate of the physics-based model, or fine-tuning a\nsurrogate model with real data. However, a comprehensive comparison of the\ninherent advantages of these hybrid approaches is still missing. The primary\nobjective of this work is to evaluate four predominant hybrid approaches in\nbuilding energy modeling through a real-world case study, with focus on indoor\nthermodynamics. To achieve this, we devise three scenarios reflecting common\nlevels of building documentation and sensor availability, assess their\nperformance, and analyze their explainability using hierarchical Shapley\nvalues. The real-world study reveals three notable findings. First, greater\nbuilding documentation and sensor availability lead to higher prediction\naccuracy for hybrid approaches. Second, the performance of hybrid approaches\ndepends on the type of building room, but the residual approach using a\nFeedforward Neural Network as data-driven sub-model performs best on average\nacross all rooms. This hybrid approach also demonstrates a superior ability to\nleverage the simulation from the physics-based sub-model. Third, hierarchical\nShapley values prove to be an effective tool for explaining and improving\nhybrid models while accounting for input correlations.",

Here, a homotopy class $\\alpha$ is said to satisfy\nthe Borsuk--Ulam property if, for each of its representatives $f\\in\\alpha$,\nthere exists an $H$-orbit where $f$ fails to be injective. Our geometric\ncharacterization is attained by constructing an $H$-equivariant map from $X$ to\nthe classical configuration space $F_{|H|}(Y)$.

While such\napproaches are generally applied to two modalities, domains such as robotics,\nhealthcare, and video need to support many types of data at once. We show that\nthe pairwise application of CLIP fails to capture joint information between\nmodalities, thereby limiting the quality of the learned representations. To\naddress this issue, we present Symile, a simple contrastive learning approach\nthat captures higher-order information between any number of modalities.

To develop Symile's objective, we derive a\nlower bound on total correlation, and show that Symile representations for any\nset of modalities form a sufficient statistic for predicting the remaining\nmodalities. Symile outperforms pairwise CLIP, even with modalities missing in\nthe data, on cross-modal classification and retrieval across several\nexperiments including on an original multilingual dataset of 33M image, text\nand audio samples and a clinical dataset of chest X-rays, electrocardiograms,\nand laboratory measurements.

Examples include political elections, ranking\nathletes based on competition results, ordering web pages in search engines\nusing hyperlink networks, and generating recommendations in online stores based\non user behavior. Various methods have been developed to infer rankings from\nincomplete or conflicting data. One such method, HodgeRank, introduced by Jiang\n{\\em et al.}~[Math.

This paper presents a\nsystematic study of HodgeRank's performance under the influence of quenched\ndisorder and across networks with complex topologies generated by four\ndifferent network models. The results reveal a transition from a regime of\nperfect retrieval of true rankings to one of imperfect retrieval as the\nstrength of the quenched disorder increases.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative approach in\nhealthcare, enabling collaborative model training across decentralized data\nsources while preserving user privacy. However, performance of FL rapidly\ndegrades in practical scenarios due to the inherent bias in non Independent and\nIdentically distributed (non-IID) data among participating clients, which poses\nsignificant challenges to model accuracy and generalization. Therefore, we\npropose the Bias-Aware Client Selection Algorithm (BACSA), which detects user\nbias and strategically selects clients based on their bias profiles. In\naddition, the proposed algorithm considers privacy preservation, fairness and\nconstraints of wireless network environments, making it suitable for sensitive\nhealthcare applications where Quality of Service (QoS), privacy and security\nare paramount. Our approach begins with a novel method for detecting user bias\nby analyzing model parameters and correlating them with the distribution of\nclass-specific data samples. We then formulate a mixed-integer non-linear\nclient selection problem leveraging the detected bias, alongside wireless\nnetwork constraints, to optimize FL performance. We demonstrate that BACSA\nimproves convergence and accuracy, compared to existing benchmarks, through\nevaluations on various data distributions, including Dirichlet and\nclass-constrained scenarios. Additionally, we explore the trade-offs between\naccuracy, fairness, and network constraints, indicating the adaptability and\nrobustness of BACSA to address diverse healthcare applications.",

In this paper, we address three research\nquestions relating to the use of digital twins for modeling trust in HATs.\nFirst, to address the question of how we can appropriately model and\noperationalize HAT trust through HDT HAT experiments, we conducted causal\nanalytics of team communication data to understand the impact of empathy,\nsocio-cognitive, and emotional constructs on trust formation.

Second, to address\nthe question of how valid measures of HDT trust are for approximating human\ntrust in HATs, we discuss the properties of HDT trust: self-report measures,\ninteraction-based measures, and compliance type behavioral measures.\nAdditionally, we share results of preliminary simulations comparing different\nLLM models for generating HDT communications and analyze their ability to\nreplicate human-like trust dynamics.

    "abstract": "In text classification tasks, models often rely on spurious correlations for\npredictions, incorrectly associating irrelevant features with the target\nlabels. This issue limits the robustness and generalization of models,\nespecially when faced with out-of-distribution data where such spurious\ncorrelations no longer hold. To address this challenge, we propose the Causally\nCalibrated Robust Classifier (CCR), which aims to reduce models' reliance on\nspurious correlations and improve model robustness. Our approach integrates a\ncausal feature selection method based on counterfactual reasoning, along with\nan unbiased inverse propensity weighting (IPW) loss function. By focusing on\nselecting causal features, we ensure that the model relies less on spurious\nfeatures during prediction. We theoretically justify our approach and\nempirically show that CCR achieves state-of-the-art performance among methods\nwithout group labels, and in some cases, it can compete with the models that\nutilize group labels.",

We find that malicious\nparameters in backdoored models are inactive on the main task, resulting in a\nsignificantly large empirical loss during the machine unlearning process on\nclean inputs. Inspired by this, we propose MASA, a method that utilizes\nindividual unlearning on local models to identify malicious models in FL. To\nimprove the performance of MASA in challenging non-independent and identically\ndistributed (non-IID) settings, we design pre-unlearning model fusion that\nintegrates local models with knowledge learned from other datasets to mitigate\nthe divergence in their unlearning behaviors caused by the non-IID data\ndistributions of clients. Additionally, we propose a new anomaly detection\nmetric with minimal hyperparameters to filter out malicious models efficiently.\nExtensive experiments on IID and non-IID datasets across six different attacks\nvalidate the effectiveness of MASA.

    "abstract": "In this work, we examine how the structure of system-bath interactions can\ndetermine commonly encountered temporal decoherence patterns, such as Gaussian\nand exponential decay, in molecular and other qubits coupled to a thermal\nbosonic bath. The analysis, based on a pure dephasing picture that admits\nanalytical treatment, shows that decoherence, in general, is neither purely\nGaussian nor exponential but rather the exponential of oscillatory functions,\nwith periods determined by the bath's frequencies. For initially unentangled\nqubit-bath states Gaussian decay is always present at early times. It becomes\nincreasingly dominant with increasing temperature, qubit-bath interaction\nstrength, and bath correlation time. Initial system-bath entanglement that\narises due to displacement in the position of the bath states preserves the\nGaussian decay. By contrast, strict exponential decay arises only in very\nspecific models that we isolate. Still, it becomes dominant for times longer\nthan the bath correlation time or for early times when there is initial\nentanglement due to momentum displacement of the bath states. For molecular\nelectronic decoherence, the long-time exponential regime plays a limited role\nas it emerges after most coherence is lost. Thus, the Gaussian decay provides a\nmore suitable (albeit imperfect) model of such decoherence. Further, we discuss\nthe connection between electronic decoherence dynamics and electronic\nspectroscopic lineshape theory, where Gaussian spectral peaks correspond to\nGaussian coherence decay and Lorentzian peaks correspond to exponential\ncoherence decay. We find that Gaussian spectral peaks, usually associated with\ninhomogeneous broadening, can emerge from the entangling unitary system-bath\ndynamics even when there is no inhomogeneity in the initial conditions.",

Traditional fuzz\ntesting employs random search, leading to lower testing efficiency and tends to\ngenerate numerous invalid test cases. By utilizing many-objective optimization\ntechniques, effective test cases can be generated. To achieve high test\ncoverage, this paper proposes several improvement strategies. The\nfrequency-based fuzz sampling strategy assigns priorities based on the\nfrequency of selection of initial data, avoiding the repetitive selection of\nthe same data and enhancing the quality of initial data better than random\nsampling strategies. To address the issue that global search may yield test not\nsatisfying semantic constraints, a local search strategy based on the Monte\nCarlo tree search is proposed to enhance the algorithm's local search\ncapabilities. Furthermore, we improve the diversity of the population and the\nalgorithm's global search capability by updating SPEA2's external archive based\non a decomposition-based archiving strategy. To validate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed approach, experiments were conducted on several public datasets\nand various neural network models. The results reveal that, compared to random\nand clustering-based sampling, the frequency-based fuzz sampling strategy\nprovides a greater improvement in coverage rate in the later stages of\niterations. On complex networks like VGG16, the improved SPEA2 algorithm\nincreased the coverage rate by about 12% across several coverage metrics, and\nby approximately 40% on LeNet series networks.

The same limit is obtained for a linear game in a well-mixed population\nwith effective payoffs that depend on reproductive values and identity measures\nbetween individuals. The first-order effect of selection on the fixation\nprobability of a strategy introduced as a single mutant can be calculated by\nusing the diffusion approximation, or alternatively by summing the successive\nexpected changes in the mutant strategy frequency that involve expected\ncoalescence times of ancestral lines under neutrality. These can be approached\nby resorting to the existence of two timescales in the genealogical process.\nKeeping the population size fixed but letting the intensity of migration go to\nzero, convergence to a continuous-time Markov chain after instantaneous initial\ntransitions yields a low-migration limit that depends on fixation probabilities\nwithin demes in the absence of migration. In the limit of small uniform\ndispersal, the fixation probability of a mutant strategy in the whole\npopulation exceeds its initial frequency if it is risk-dominant over the other\nstrategy with respect to the overall average payoffs in pairwise interactions.\nFinally, in the low-mutation limit in the presence of recurrent mutation, the\naverage abundance of a strategy in the long run is determined by the fixation\nprobabilities of both strategies when introduced as single mutants in a deme\nchosen at random.",

    "abstract": "Solving combinatorial games has been a classic research topic in artificial\nintelligence because solutions can offer essential information to improve\ngameplay. Several definitions exist for `solving the game,' but they are\nmarkedly different regarding computational cost and the detail of insights\nderived. In this study, we introduce a novel definition called `semi-strongly\nsolved' and propose an algorithm to achieve this type of solution efficiently.\nThis new definition addresses existing gaps because of its intermediate\ncomputational cost and the quality of the solution. To demonstrate the\npotential of our approach, we derive the theoretical computational complexity\nof our algorithm under a simple condition, and apply it to semi-strongly solve\nthe game of 6x6 Othello.

    "abstract": "Nature-inspired computation is receiving increasing attention. Various Ising\nmachine implementations have recently been proven to be effective in solving\nnumerous combinatorial optimization problems including maximum cut, low density\nparity check (LDPC) decoding, and Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. In\nthis paper, a novel method is presented to solve SAT or MAX-SAT problems with a\nCMOS circuit implementation. The technique solves a SAT problem by mapping the\nSAT variables onto quantized capacitor voltages generated by an array of nodes\nthat interact through a network of coupling units. The nodal interaction is\nachieved through coupling currents produced by the coupling units, which charge\nor discharge capacitor voltages, implementing a gradient descent along the SAT\nproblem's cost function to minimize the number of unsatisfied clauses. The\nsystem also incorporates a unique low-complexity perturbation scheme to avoid\nsettling in local minima, greatly enhancing the performance of the system. The\nsimulation results demonstrate that the proposed SKI-SAT is a high-performance\nand low-energy alternative that surpasses existing solvers by significant\nmargins, achieving more than 10 times faster solution and 300 times less power.",

As data continues to grow in\nvolume, variety, and complexity, there is an increasing need for advanced but\nuser-friendly tools, such as intelligent discovery assistants (IDAs) or\nautomated machine learning (AutoML) systems, that facilitate the user's\ninteraction with the data.

The\nassistance offered by IDAs or AutoML tools should not be guided only by the\nanalytical problem's data but should also be tailored to each individual user.\nTo this end, this work explores the usage of Knowledge Graphs (KG) as a basic\nframework for capturing in a human-centered manner complex analytics workflows,\nby storing information not only about the workflow's components, datasets and\nalgorithms but also about the users, their intents and their feedback, among\nothers. The data stored in the generated KG can then be exploited to provide\nassistance (e.g., recommendations) to the users interacting with these systems.\nTo accomplish this objective, two methods are explored in this work.

The\napplication of angles-only (AO) navigation for proximity operations is often\nmet with hesitancy due to its inherent limitations in determining range,\nleading to issues in target observability and consequently, mission safety.\nHowever, this form of navigation remains highly appealing due to its low cost.\nThis work employs Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) for the design and guidance of such far-range trajectories, assuring\nobservability, safety and robustness under angles-only navigation. Firstly, PSO\nis used to design a nominal trajectory that is observable, robust and safe.\nSubsequently, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a cutting-edge RL algorithm,\nis utilized to develop a guidance controller capable of maintaining\nobservability while steering the spacecraft from an initial perturbed state to\na target state. The fidelity of the guidance controller is then tested in a\nMonte-Carlo (MC) manner by varying the initial relative spacecraft state. The\nobservability of the nominal trajectory and the perturbed trajectories with\nguidance are validated using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The perturbed\ntrajectories are also shown to adhere to the safety requirements satisfied by\nthe nominal trajectory.

The\nincreased power factor is due to a decoupling of the Seebeck coefficient and\nelectrical conductivity identified through a changing scattering mechanism. Ion\nimplantation causes the abundant production of Frenkel pairs, which were found\nto suppress compensating donors in CuI, and which scenario was also supported\nby density functional theory calculations. The compensating donor suppression\nled to a significantly improved Hall carrier concentration, increasing from\n$6.5\\times10^{19}\\pm0.1\\times10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ to\n$11.5\\times10^{19}\\pm0.4\\times10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$. This work provides an\nimportant step forward in the development of CuI as a transparent conducting\nmaterial for electronics and thermoelectric generators by introducing\nbeneficial point defects with ion implantation.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing the modular structure of existing systems has attracted substantial\nresearch interest, focusing on two main methods: (1) software modularization\nand (2) identifying design issues (e.g., smells) as refactoring opportunities.\nHowever, re-modularization solutions often require extensive modifications to\nthe original modules, and the design issues identified are generally too coarse\nto guide refactoring strategies. Combining the above two methods, this paper\nintroduces a novel concept, PairSmell, which exploits modularization to\npinpoint design issues necessitating refactoring. We concentrate on a granular\nbut fundamental aspect of modularity principles -- modular relation (MR), i.e.,\nwhether a pair of entities are separated or collocated. The main assumption is\nthat, if the actual MR of a pair violates its `apt MR', i.e., an MR agreed on\nby multiple modularization tools (as raters), it can be deemed likely a flawed\narchitectural decision that necessitates further examination. To quantify and\nevaluate PairSmell, we conduct an empirical study on 20 C/C++ and Java\nprojects, using 4 established modularization tools to identify two forms of\nPairSmell: inapt separated pairs InSep and inapt collocated pairs InCol. Our\nstudy on 260,003 instances reveals that their architectural impacts are\nsubstantial: (1) on average, 14.60% and 20.44% of software entities are\ninvolved in InSep and InCol MRs respectively; (2) InSep pairs are associated\nwith 190% more co-changes than properly separated pairs, while InCol pairs are\nassociated with 35% fewer co-changes than properly collocated pairs, both\nindicating a successful identification of modular structures detrimental to\nsoftware quality; and (3) both forms of PairSmell persist across software\nevolution.",

Methods:\nThe proposed method consists of segmented saturation modules with radial FLASH\nreadouts and golden angle progression. The segmented saturation blocks drive\nthe system to steady-state, and because center k-space is sampled repeatedly,\nsteady-state saturation dominates contrast during gridding and reconstruction.\nTen complete Z-spectra were acquired in healthy mice using both ECG and\nrespiratory-gated, and ungated methods. Z-spectra were also acquired at\nmultiple saturation B1 values to optimize for amide and creatine contrasts.\nResults: There was no significant difference between CEST contrasts (amide,\ncreatine, MT) calculated from images acquired using ECG and respiratory-gated\nand ungated methods (p = 0.27, 0.11, 0.47). A saturation power of 1.8$\\mu$T\nprovides optimal contrast amplitudes for both amide and total creatine contrast\nwithout significantly complicating CEST contrast quantification due to water\ndirect saturation, magnetization transfer, and RF spillover between amide and\ncreatine pools. Further, variability in CEST contrast measurements was\nsignificantly reduced using the ungated radial FLASH acquisition (p = 0.002,\n0.006 for amide and creatine respectively). Conclusion: This method enables\nCEST mapping in the murine myocardium without the need for cardiac or\nrespiratory gating. Quantitative CEST contrasts are consistent with those\nobtained using gated sequences, and per-contrast variance is significantly\nreduced. This approach makes preclinical cardiac CEST-MRI easily accessible,\neven for investigators without prior experience in cardiac imaging.",

    "abstract": "Plotting the residuals is a recommended procedure to diagnose deviations from\nlinear model assumptions, such as non-linearity, heteroscedasticity, and\nnon-normality. The presence of structure in residual plots can be tested using\nthe lineup protocol to do visual inference. There are a variety of conventional\nresidual tests, but the lineup protocol, used as a statistical test, performs\nbetter for diagnostic purposes because it is less sensitive and applies more\nbroadly to different types of departures. However, the lineup protocol relies\non human judgment which limits its scalability. This work presents a solution\nby providing a computer vision model to automate the assessment of residual\nplots. It is trained to predict a distance measure that quantifies the\ndisparity between the residual distribution of a fitted classical normal linear\nregression model and the reference distribution, based on Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence. From extensive simulation studies, the computer vision model\nexhibits lower sensitivity than conventional tests but higher sensitivity than\nhuman visual tests. It is slightly less effective on non-linearity patterns.\nSeveral examples from classical papers and contemporary data illustrate the new\nprocedures, highlighting its usefulness in automating the diagnostic process\nand supplementing existing methods.",

Traditional\nmodel-based approaches, which rely on complex sequential mathematical\nformulations, struggle to meet real-time operational demands. Deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by enabling offline\ntraining with distribution network simulators, followed by real-time execution.\nHowever, DRL algorithms tend to converge to local optima due to limited\nexploration efficiency. Additionally, DRL algorithms can not enforce voltage\nmagnitude constraints, leading to potential operational violations when\nimplemented in the distribution network operation. This study addresses these\nchallenges by proposing a novel safe imitation reinforcement learning (IRL)\nframework that combines IRL and a designed safety layer, aiming to optimize the\noperation of Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) in active distribution networks. The\nproposed safe IRL framework comprises two phases: offline training and online\nexecution. During the offline phase, optimal state-action pairs are collected\nusing an NLP solver, guiding the IRL policy iteration. In the online phase, the\ntrained IRL policy's decisions are adjusted by the safety layer to maintain\nsafety and constraint compliance. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy\nof Safe IRL in balancing operational efficiency and safety, eliminating voltage\nviolations, and maintaining low operation cost errors across various network\nsizes, while meeting real-time execution requirements.",

Astrophysicists incorporate facility usage data into their\nscientific publications, embedding this information in plain-text. Traditional\nautomatic search queries prove unreliable for accurate tracking due to the\nmisidentification of facility names in plain-text. As automatic search queries\nfail, researchers are required to manually classify publications for facility\nusage, which consumes valuable research time. In this work, we introduce a\nmachine learning classification framework for the automatic identification of\nfacility usage of observation sections in astrophysics publications. Our\nframework identifies sentences containing telescope mission keywords (e.g.,\nKepler and TESS) in each publication. Subsequently, the identified sentences\nare transformed using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and classified\nwith a Support Vector Machine. The classification framework leverages the\ncontext surrounding the identified telescope mission keywords to provide\nrelevant information to the classifier. The framework successfully classifies\nusage of MAST hosted missions with a 92.9% accuracy. Furthermore, our framework\ndemonstrates robustness when compared to other approaches, considering common\nmetrics and computational complexity. The framework's interpretability makes it\nadaptable for use across observatories and other scientific facilities\nworldwide.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the\nfield of natural language processing (NLP). By fine-tuning LLMs with data from\nspecific scenarios, these foundation models can better adapt to various\ndownstream tasks. However, the fine-tuning process poses privacy leakage risks,\nparticularly in centralized data processing scenarios. To address user privacy\nconcerns, federated learning (FL) has been introduced to mitigate the risks\nassociated with centralized data collection from multiple sources.\nNevertheless, the privacy of LLMs themselves is equally critical, as potential\nmalicious attacks challenge their security, an issue that has received limited\nattention in current research. Consequently, establishing a trusted multi-party\nmodel fine-tuning environment is essential. Additionally, the local deployment\nof large LLMs incurs significant storage costs and high computational demands.\nTo address these challenges, we propose for the first time a federated discrete\nand transferable prompt tuning, namely FedDTPT, for black-box large language\nmodels. In the client optimization phase, we adopt a token-level discrete\nprompt optimization method that leverages a feedback loop based on prediction\naccuracy to drive gradient-free prompt optimization through the MLM API. For\nserver optimization, we employ an attention mechanism based on semantic\nsimilarity to filter all local prompt tokens, along with an embedding distance\nelbow detection and DBSCAN clustering strategy to enhance the filtering\nprocess. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, our approach achieves higher accuracy, reduced communication overhead,\nand robustness to non-iid data in a black-box setting. Moreover, the optimized\nprompts are transferable.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that the brain uses an attention schema, or a\nsimplified model of attention, to help control what it attends to. One proposed\nbenefit of this model is to allow agents to model the attention states of other\nagents, and thus predict and interact with other agents. The effects of an\nattention schema may be examined in artificial agents. Although attention\nmechanisms in artificial agents are different from in biological brains, there\nmay be some principles in common. In both cases, select features or\nrepresentations are emphasized for better performance. Here, using neural\nnetworks with transformer attention mechanisms, we asked whether the addition\nof an attention schema affected the ability of agents to make judgements about\nand cooperate with each other. First, we found that an agent with an attention\nschema is better at categorizing the attention states of other agents (higher\naccuracy). Second, an agent with an attention schema develops a pattern of\nattention that is easier for other agents to categorize. Third, in a joint task\nwhere two agents must predict each other to paint a scene together, adding an\nattention schema improves performance. Finally, the performance improvements\nare not caused by a general increase in network complexity. Instead,\nimprovement is specific to tasks involving judging, categorizing, or predicting\nthe attention of other agents. These results support the hypothesis that an\nattention schema has computational properties beneficial to mutual\ninterpretability and interactive behavior.

To shed more light on the underlying\nunanswered questions, we conduct an extensive study on the robustness and\nsimilarity of the most common scoring functions for sample difficulty\nestimation, as well as their potential benefits in CL, using the popular\nbenchmark dataset CIFAR-10 and the acoustic scene classification task from the\nDCASE2020 challenge as representatives of computer vision and computer\naudition, respectively.

    "abstract": "A promising way to test the physics of the accelerated expansion of the\nUniverse is by studying the growth rate of matter fluctuations, which can be\nparametrized by the matter energy density parameter to the power $\\gamma$, the\nso-called growth index. It is well-known that the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology\npredicts $\\gamma=0.55$. However, using observational data, Nguyen et al. (2023)\nmeasured a much higher $\\gamma=0.633^{+0.025}_{-0.024}$, excluding the\n$\\Lambda$CDM value within $3.7\\sigma$. In this work, we analyze whether Dark\nEnergy (DE) with the Equation of State (EoS) parameter described by the CPL\nparametrization can significantly modify $\\gamma$ with respect to the predicted\n$\\Lambda$CDM one. Besides the usual Smooth DE (SDE) scenario, where DE\nperturbations are neglected on small scales, we also consider the case of\nClustering Dark Energy (CDE), which has more potential to impact the growth of\nmatter perturbations. In order to minimally constrain the background evolution\nand assess the largest meaningful $\\gamma$ distribution, we use data from $32$\nCosmic Chronometers, $H(z$), data points. In this context, we found that both\nSDE and CDE models described by the CPL parametrization have almost negligible\nprobability of providing $\\gamma>0.6$. However, given that the measured\n$\\gamma$ value assumes the $\\Lambda$CDM background, a direct statistical\nmeasure of the incompatibility between theory and the measured value can not be\ndone for other backgrounds. Thus, we devise a method in order to make a quick\nestimation of the $\\gamma$ constraints for CPL background. This method\nindicates that, when using DESI DR2 BAO data to constrain background\nparameters, no significant changes in the $\\gamma$ central value and\nuncertainty is observed. (Abridged)",

However, concerns persist regarding the\ntransparency and context of data collection methodologies, especially when\nsourced through crowdsourcing platforms. Crowdsourcing often employs low-wage\nworkers with poor working conditions and lacks consideration for the\nrepresentativeness of annotators, leading to algorithms that fail to represent\ndiverse views and perpetuate biases against certain groups. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a methodology involving a co-design model that actively\nengages stakeholders at key stages, integrating principles of Equity,\nDiversity, and Inclusion (EDI) to ensure diverse viewpoints.

In the simplest bipartite setting, there\nexist signaling correlations for which it is fundamentally impossible to\nascribe a definite causal order for the parties' actions. Moreover, the\nassumptions required to arrive at such a statement (local quantum\ntransformations and well-behaved probabilities) result in a nontrivial set of\ncorrelations, whose boundary is, to date, uncharacterized. In this work, we\ninvestigate indefinite causal order in boxworld theories. We construct a\nhigher-order theory whose descriptor is the generalized bit (gbit) - the\nnatural successor of the classical bit and quantum qubit. By fixing the local\ntransformations in boxworld and asking about the global causal structure, we\nfind that we trivially recover the full set of two-way signaling correlations.\nIn light of this, we motivate and propose two physical principles in order to\nlimit the set of achievable correlations: nonsignaling preservation and no\nsignaling without system exchange. We find that a higher-order boxworld theory\nthat respects these physical principles leads to (i) a nontrivial set of\nachievable correlations and (ii) a violation of some causal inequalities that\nis higher than what can be achieved in higher-order quantum theory.

    "abstract": "The quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) is a popular tool for analyzing\ndyadic data in medical and social sciences. To test the association between two\ndyadic measurements represented by two symmetric matrices, QAP calculates the\np-value by permuting the units, or equivalently, by permuting the rows and\ncolumns of one matrix in the same way. Its extension to the regression setting,\nknown as the multiple regression QAP, has also gained popularity, especially in\npsychometrics. However, the statistics theory for QAP has not been fully\nestablished in the literature. We fill the gap in this paper. We formulate the\nnetwork models underlying various QAPs. We derive (a) the asymptotic sampling\ndistributions of some canonical test statistics and (b) the corresponding\nasymptotic permutation distributions induced by QAP under strong and weak null\nhypotheses. Task (a) relies on applying the theory of U-statistics, and task\n(b) relies on applying the theory of double-indexed permutation statistics. The\ncombination of tasks (a) and (b) provides a relatively complete picture of QAP.\nOverall, our asymptotic theory suggests that using properly studentized\nstatistics in QAP is a robust choice in that it is finite-sample exact under\nthe strong null hypothesis and preserves the asymptotic type one error rate\nunder the weak null hypothesis.",

Thus, to establish an interpretative\nframework for these efforts, detailed observations that simultaneously provide\nhigh sensitivity, spatial resolution, and large bandwidths for a subset of\ndiverse sources are needed. Here, we present wideband (32 GHz) Submillimeter\nArray observations of four high-mass star-forming regions (G28.20-0.05,\nG20.08-0.14 N, G35.58-0.03, W33 Main) at subarcsecond resolution, where we\ndetect and spatially-resolve 100s of lines from over 60 molecules, including\nmany complex organic molecules (COMs). The chemical richness of our sample is\nconsistent with an evolutionary sequence from the line-rich hot cores and HC\nHII regions of G28.20-0.05 and G20.08-0.14 N to the more chemically-modest UC\nHII regions in G35.58-0.03, followed by the molecule-poor HII region W33 Main.\nWe detect lines across a range of excitation conditions (Eu=20 to >800 K) and\nfrom numerous isotopologues, which enables robust estimates of gas properties.\nWe derive nearly constant COM column density ratios that agree with literature\nvalues in other low- and high-mass protostellar cores, supporting the idea that\nCOM abundances are set during the pre-stellar phase. In all regions, we\nidentify spatial offsets among different molecular families, due to a\ncombination of source physical structure and chemistry. In particular, we find\npotential evidence of carbon grain sublimation in G28.20-0.05 and identify an\nelemental oxygen gradient and rich sulfur-chemistry in G35.58-0.03. Overall,\nthese results demonstrate that the SMA's wide bandwidth is a powerful tool to\nuntangle the complex molecular gas structures associated with massive star\nformation.",

We consider small shape deformations of a\nspherical entangling surface, for both the non-supersymmetric and the\nsupersymmetric cases.

However,\nmost of the existing benchmarks for NeSy AI fail to provide long-horizon\nreasoning tasks with complex multi-agent interactions. Furthermore, they are\nusually constrained by fixed and simplistic logical rules over limited\nentities, making them far from real-world complexities. To address these\ncrucial gaps, we introduce LogiCity, the first simulator based on customizable\nfirst-order logic (FOL) for an urban-like environment with multiple dynamic\nagents. LogiCity models diverse urban elements using semantic and spatial\nconcepts, such as IsAmbulance(X) and IsClose(X, Y). These concepts are used to\ndefine FOL rules that govern the behavior of various agents. Since the concepts\nand rules are abstractions, they can be universally applied to cities with any\nagent compositions, facilitating the instantiation of diverse scenarios.\nBesides, a key feature of LogiCity is its support for user-configurable\nabstractions, enabling customizable simulation complexities for logical\nreasoning. To explore various aspects of NeSy AI, LogiCity introduces two\ntasks, one features long-horizon sequential decision-making, and the other\nfocuses on one-step visual reasoning, varying in difficulty and agent\nbehaviors. Our extensive evaluation reveals the advantage of NeSy frameworks in\nabstract reasoning. Moreover, we highlight the significant challenges of\nhandling more complex abstractions in long-horizon multi-agent scenarios or\nunder high-dimensional, imbalanced data.

To understand the interplay between strong spin\nand electronic correlations in highly polar materials, we studied gadolinium\niron oxide (GdFeO3), which selectively forms photoexcited polarons through an\nFe-O-Fe superexchange inter-action. Excitation-wavelength-dependent transient\nextreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy selectively excites LMCT and\nmetal-to-metal charge transfer transitions (MMCT). The LMCT transition\nsuppresses photoexcited polaron formation due to the balance between\nsuperexchange and Hubbard interactions, while MMCT transitions result in\nphotoexcited polaron formation within 250+/-40 fs. Ab initio theory\ndemonstrates that electron and hole polarons localize on iron centers following\nMMCT. In addition to understanding how strong electronic and spin correlations\ncan control strong electron-phonon coupling, these experiments separately\nmeasure electron and hole polaron interactions on neighboring metal centers for\nthe first time, providing insight into a large range of charge-transfer and\nMott-Hubbard insulators.",

To realize this vision, we first collected and built an Open-World\nVideo Game Dataset from scratch. It is the first and largest dataset for\nopen-world game video generation and control, which comprises over a million\ndiverse gameplay video clips sampling from over 150 games with informative\ncaptions from GPT-4o. GameGen-X undergoes a two-stage training process,\nconsisting of foundation model pre-training and instruction tuning. Firstly,\nthe model was pre-trained via text-to-video generation and video continuation,\nendowing it with the capability for long-sequence, high-quality open-domain\ngame video generation. Further, to achieve interactive controllability, we\ndesigned InstructNet to incorporate game-related multi-modal control signal\nexperts. This allows the model to adjust latent representations based on user\ninputs, unifying character interaction and scene content control for the first\ntime in video generation. During instruction tuning, only the InstructNet is\nupdated while the pre-trained foundation model is frozen, enabling the\nintegration of interactive controllability without loss of diversity and\nquality of generated video content.",

We find that the\ngauge coupling naturally jumps around this intermediate scale since counter\nterms for the renormalization behave so. If the gauge coupling becomes strong\nwith a large scalar field value due to this effect, there can be an enhanced\nsmall instanton contribution, the dilute gas approximation of which is\njustified because the gauge sector decouples when the scalar wave mode is very\nshort. Using these findings, we discuss the QCD axion quality problem, the\nheavy QCD axion, the QCD axion abundance, and the suppression of isocurvature\nperturbations.

To\nachieve this, combining data across multiple subjects is crucial. However, in\nsEEG cohorts, each subject has a variable number of electrodes placed at\ndistinct locations in their brain, solely based on clinical needs. Such\nheterogeneity in electrode number/placement poses a significant challenge for\ndata integration, since there is no clear correspondence of the neural activity\nrecorded at distinct sites between individuals. Here we introduce seegnificant:\na training framework and architecture that can be used to decode behavior\nacross subjects using sEEG data. We tokenize the neural activity within\nelectrodes using convolutions and extract long-term temporal dependencies\nbetween tokens using self-attention in the time dimension. The 3D location of\neach electrode is then mixed with the tokens, followed by another\nself-attention in the electrode dimension to extract effective spatiotemporal\nneural representations. Subject-specific heads are then used for downstream\ndecoding tasks. Using this approach, we construct a multi-subject model trained\non the combined data from 21 subjects performing a behavioral task. We\ndemonstrate that our model is able to decode the trial-wise response time of\nthe subjects during the behavioral task solely from neural data. We also show\nthat the neural representations learned by pretraining our model across\nindividuals can be transferred in a few-shot manner to new subjects.

    "abstract": "In the asymptotic limit of a large diffusivity ratio, certain two-component\nreaction-diffusion (RD) systems can admit localized spike solutions on a 1-D\nfinite domain in a far-from-equilibrium nonlinear regime. It is known that two\ndistinct bifurcation mechanisms can occur which generate spike patterns of\nincreased spatial complexity as the domain half-length L slowly increases;\nso-called spike nucleation and spike self-replication. Self-replication is\nfound to occur via the passage beyond a saddle-node bifurcation point that can\nbe predicted through linearization around the inner spike profile. In contrast,\nspike nucleation occurs through slow passage beyond the saddle-node of a\nnonlinear boundary-value problem defined in the outer region away from the core\nof a spike. Here, by treating L as a static parameter, precise conditions are\nestablished within the semi-strong interaction asymptotic regime to determine\nwhich occurs, conditions that are confirmed by numerical simulation and\ncontinuation. For the Schnakenberg and Brusselator RD models, phase diagrams in\nparameter space are derived that predict whether spike self-replication or\nspike nucleation will occur first as L is increased, or whether no such\ninstability will occur. For the Gierer-Meinhardt model with a non-trivial\nactivator background, spike nucleation is shown to be the only possible\nspike-generating mechanism. From time-dependent PDE numerical results on an\nexponentially slowly growing domain, it is shown that the analytical thresholds\nderived from the asymptotic theory accurately predict critical values of L\nwhere either spike self-replication or spike-nucleation will occur. The global\nbifurcation mechanism for transitions to patterns of increased spatial\ncomplexity is further elucidated by superimposing time-dependent PDE simulation\nresults on the numerically computed solution branches of spike equilibria.",

Lossy compression has been widely\nrecognized as a promising solution to enhance scientific data management\nsystems regarding such challenges, although most existing compression solutions\nare tailored for Cartesian grids and thus have sub-optimal results on discrete\nparticle data. In this paper, we introduce LCP, an innovative lossy compressor\ndesigned for particle datasets, offering superior compression quality and\nhigher speed than existing compression solutions. Specifically, our\ncontribution is threefold. (1) We propose LCP-S, an error-bound aware\nblock-wise spatial compressor to efficiently reduce particle data size.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but\ntheir outputs can sometimes be unreliable or factually incorrect. To address\nthis, we introduce Self Logits Evolution Decoding (SLED), a novel decoding\nframework that enhances the truthfulness of LLMs without relying on external\nknowledge bases or requiring further fine-tuning. From an optimization\nperspective, our SLED framework leverages the latent knowledge embedded within\nthe LLM by contrasting the output logits from the final layer with those from\nearly layers. It then utilizes an approximate gradient approach to enable\nlatent knowledge to guide the self-refinement of outputs, thereby effectively\nimproving factual accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on\nestablished benchmarks across a diverse range of model families (Gemma, Qwen,\nMixtral, gpt-oss) and scales (from 1B to 45B), including more advanced\narchitectural configurations such as the mixture of experts (MoE). Our\nevaluation spans a wide variety of tasks and the results demonstrate that SLED\nconsistently improves factual accuracy compared to existing decoding methods\nwhile maintaining natural language fluency and negligible latency overhead.\nFurthermore, it can be flexibly combined with other decoding methods to further\nenhance their performance.",

This can be\ntime-consuming and error-prone for complex designs. Large Language Models\n(LLMs) are emerging as a potential tool to help generate fully functioning HDL\ncode, but most works have focused on generation in the single-shot capacity:\ni.e., run and evaluate, a process that does not leverage debugging and, as\nsuch, does not adequately reflect a realistic development process. In this\nwork, we evaluate the ability of LLMs to leverage feedback from electronic\ndesign automation (EDA) tools to fix mistakes in their own generated Verilog.\nTo accomplish this, we present an open-source, highly customizable framework,\nAutoChip, which combines conversational LLMs with the output from Verilog\ncompilers and simulations to iteratively generate and repair Verilog. To\ndetermine the success of these LLMs we leverage the VerilogEval benchmark set.\nWe evaluate four state-of-the-art conversational LLMs, focusing on readily\naccessible commercial models. EDA tool feedback proved to be consistently more\neffective than zero-shot prompting only with GPT-4o, the most computationally\ncomplex model we evaluated. In the best case, we observed a 5.8% increase in\nthe number of successful designs with a 34.2% decrease in cost over the best\nzero-shot results. Mixing smaller models with this larger model at the end of\nthe feedback iterations resulted in equally as much success as with GPT-4o\nusing feedback, but incurred 41.9% lower cost (corresponding to an overall\ndecrease in cost over zero-shot by 89.6%).",

To obtain the lowest equilibrium geometries,\nwe select the 10 lowest configurations for further minimization using density\nfunctional theory. The resulting structures are lower in energy than previously\nreported results. The structural and energetic stability of these clusters are\nstudied using various descriptors such as binding energy, ionization\npotentials, fragmentation energy, first and second energy difference,\nvibrational and optical spectra. The energetic analysis shows that clusters\nwith N = 4, 8, 12, 14, 16 and 19 are more stable. The analysis of fragmentation\nenergies also supports these findings. Our calculations show that non-covalent\ninteractions play a significant role in stabilizing the water clusters. The\ninfrared spectra of water clusters display three distinct bands: intermolecular\nO...H vibrations, 23 to 1191 cm^-1, intramolecular H-O-H bending, 1600 to 1741\ncm^-1, and O-H stretching, 3229 to 3877 cm^-1. The strongest intensity is\nobserved in the low-frequency symmetric stretching modes, along with a\nnoticeable red shift in the stretching vibrations. The optical band gap ranges\nfrom 7.14 eV to 8.17 eV and lies in the ultraviolet region. The absorption\nspectra also show line broadening for clusters with n>=10, resulting in an\nincrease in spectral lines.

This\npreorder gives us the power to describe monadic and comonadic programming. As a\nconsequence, it extends the existing logical view of metaprogramming in two\ndirections: first, it ensures that code generation can be done efficiently by\ncontrolling memory accesses; second, it allows us to provide resource\nguarantees about the generated code (i.e. code that is for example\ngarbage-free).\n  We present the static and dynamic semantics of Elevator.

Here we address effects of the ambient solar\nwind on the propagation of two similar CME-driven shocks from the Sun to Earth.\nThe two shock events (CME03: April 3, 2010 and CME12: July 12, 2012) have the\nfollowing properties: Both events (1) were driven by a halo CME (i.e., source\nlocation is near the Sun-Earth line), (2) had a CME source in the southern\nhemisphere, (3) had a similar transit time (~2 days) to Earth, (4) occurred in\na non-quiet solar period, and (5) led to a severe geomagnetic storm. The\ninitial (near the Sun) propagation speed, as measured by coronagraph images,\nwas slower (by ~300 km/s) for CME03 than CME12, but it took about the same\namount of traveling time for both events to reach Earth. According to the\nin-situ solar wind observations from the Wind spacecraft, the CME03-driven\nshock was associated with a faster solar wind upstream of the shock than the\nCME12-driven shock. This is also demonstrated in our global MHD simulations.\nAnalysis of our simulation result indicates that the drag force indirectly\nplays an important role in the shock propagation. The present study suggests\nthat in addition to the initial CME propagation speed near the Sun the shock\nspeed (in the inertial frame) and the ambient solar wind condition, in\nparticular the solar wind speed, are the key to timing the arrival of\nCME-driven-shock events.",

To suppress the extrinsic contribution and thus enhance the\nintrinsic contribution, we increased the Fe content in the stoichiometric\nFe3Sn. We found that the extrinsic contribution is greatly suppressed, and the\nintrinsic contribution is dominant and is close to the theoretically predicted\nvalue of 555 S/cm over the whole temperature range. Based on the formula of the\nskew scattering, we analyzed the reason why the skew scattering is suppressed\nand found that the spin-orbit coupling strength provided by the impurity center\nis the key. The spin-orbit coupling strength provided by Fe as an impurity\ncenter in this study is much smaller than that of Sn as an impurity center in\nprevious studies. Therefore, the AHC in Fe-rich Fe3Sn obeys the unified theory,\nwhile the AHC in Sn-rich Fe3Sn deviates from the unified theory. Our study\nprovides a promising solution for the regulation of the extrinsic contribution\nto the anomalous Hall effect in kagome magnets.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating datasets in data marketplaces, where the buyer aim to purchase\nvaluable data, is a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce an\ninnovative task-agnostic data valuation method called PriArTa which is an\napproach for computing the distance between the distribution of the buyer's\nexisting dataset and the seller's dataset, allowing the buyer to determine how\neffectively the new data can enhance its dataset. PriArTa is\ncommunication-efficient, enabling the buyer to evaluate datasets without\nneeding access to the entire dataset from each seller. Instead, the buyer\nrequests that sellers perform specific preprocessing on their data and then\nsend back the results. Using this information and a scoring metric, the buyer\ncan evaluate the dataset. The preprocessing is designed to allow the buyer to\ncompute the score while preserving the privacy of each seller's dataset,\nmitigating the risk of information leakage before the purchase. A key feature\nof PriArTa is its robustness to common data transformations, ensuring\nconsistent value assessment and reducing the risk of purchasing redundant data.\nThe effectiveness of PriArTa is demonstrated through experiments on real-world\nimage datasets, showing its ability to perform privacy-preserving,\naugmentation-robust data valuation in data marketplaces.",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this\nissue by incorporating knowledge from external databases, enabling more\naccurate and relevant responses. Due to the context window constraints of LLMs,\nit is impractical to input the entire external database context directly into\nthe model. Instead, only the most relevant information, referred to as chunks,\nis selectively retrieved. However, current RAG research faces three key\nchallenges. First, existing solutions often select each chunk independently,\noverlooking potential correlations among them. Second, in practice the utility\nof chunks is non-monotonic, meaning that adding more chunks can decrease\noverall utility. Traditional methods emphasize maximizing the number of\nincluded chunks, which can inadvertently compromise performance. Third, each\ntype of user query possesses unique characteristics that require tailored\nhandling, an aspect that current approaches do not fully consider. To overcome\nthese challenges, we propose a cost constrained retrieval optimization system\nCORAG for retrieval-augmented generation. We employ a Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS) based policy framework to find optimal chunk combinations sequentially,\nallowing for a comprehensive consideration of correlations among chunks.\nAdditionally, rather than viewing budget exhaustion as a termination condition,\nwe integrate budget constraints into the optimization of chunk combinations,\neffectively addressing the non-monotonicity of chunk utility.",

In the pharmaceutical\nsector, crystallization model-based design can contribute to shortening\nexcessive drug development timelines. Even so, two major barriers, typical of\nmost transport equations, not just PBEs, have limited this potential. Notably,\nthe time taken to compute a solution to these models with representative\naccuracy is frequently limiting. Likewise, the model construction process is\noften tedious and wastes valuable time, owing to the reliance on human\nexpertise to guess constituent models from empirical data. Hybrid models\npromise to overcome both barriers through tight integration of neural networks\nwith physical PBE models. Towards eliminating experimental guesswork, hybrid\nmodels facilitate determining physical relationships from data, also known as\n'discovering physics'. Here, we aim to prepare for planned Scientific Machine\nLearning (SciML) integration through a contemporary implementation of an\nexisting PBE algorithm, one with computational efficiency and differentiability\nat the forefront. To accomplish this, we utilized JAX, a cutting-edge library\nfor accelerated computing. We showcase the speed benefits of this modern take\non PBE modelling by benchmarking our solver to others we prepared using older,\nmore widespread software. Primarily among these software tools is the\nubiquitous NumPy, where we show JAX achieves up to 300x relative acceleration\nin PBE simulations. Our solver is also fully differentiable, which we\ndemonstrate is the only feasible option for integrating learnable data-driven\nmodels at scale.

Recent observations by Parker Solar Probe\n(PSP) indicate that the magnetic flux ropes of a CME can trap energetic\nparticles and act as barriers, preventing other particles from crossing. In\nthis paper, we introduce the novel COCONUT+PARADISE model to investigate the\nconfinement of energetic particles within a flux rope and the effects of\ncross-field diffusion (CFD) on particle transport in the solar corona,\nparticularly in the presence of a CME. Using the global magnetohydrodynamic\ncoronal model COCONUT, we generate background configurations containing a CME\nmodeled as a Titov-D\\'emoulin flux rope (TDFR). We then utilize the particle\ntransport code PARADISE to inject monoenergetic 100 keV protons inside one of\nthe TDFR legs near its footpoint and evolve the particles through the COCONUT\nbackgrounds. To study CFD, we employ two different approaches regarding the\nperpendicular proton mean free path (MFP): a constant MFP and a Larmor\nradius-dependent MFP. We contrast these results with those obtained without\nCFD. While particles remain fully trapped within the TDFR without CFD, we find\nthat even relatively small perpendicular MFP values allow particles on the\nouter layers to escape. In contrast, the initially interior trapped particles\nstay largely confined.

We\npropose a machine learning protocol with ternary classification of\ninstantaneous spin configurations using known values of disordered phase energy\nand ordered phase energy. The trained neural network is used to predict whether\na given sample belong to one or another phase of matter. This allows us to\nestimate for the first time the probability that configurations with a certain\nenergy belong to the ordered phase, coexistence phase, and disordered phase.\nBased on these probabilities, we obtained estimates of the values of the\ncritical energies and latent heat for the Potts model with 10 and 20\ncomponents, which undergoes a strong discontinuous transition. We also found\nthat the probabilities may reflect geometric transitions in the coexistence\nphase.",

To manage these conditions, the research explores the built in\npotential of these cameras to adjust pixel functionality, named bias settings.\nAs cars are driven at various times and locations, shifts in lighting\nconditions are unavoidable. Consequently, this paper utilizes the neuromorphic\nYOLO-based face tracking module of a driver monitoring system as the\nevent-based application to study. The proposed method uses numerical metrics to\ncontinuously monitor the performance of the event-based application in\nreal-time. When the application malfunctions, the system detects this through a\ndrop in the metrics and automatically adjusts the event cameras bias values.\nThe Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm is employed to optimize this adjustment, with\nfinetuning continuing until performance returns to a satisfactory level. The\nadvantage of bias optimization lies in its ability to handle conditions such as\nflickering or darkness without requiring additional hardware or software. To\ndemonstrate the capabilities of the proposed system, it was tested under\nconditions where detecting human faces with default bias values was impossible.\nThese severe conditions were simulated using dim ambient light and various\nflickering frequencies. Following the automatic and dynamic process of bias\nmodification, the metrics for face detection significantly improved under all\nconditions. Autobiasing resulted in an increase in the YOLO confidence\nindicators by more than 33 percent for object detection and 37 percent for face\ndetection highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

In this work we will consider the competition model extended\nby extra interaction between involved populations which is given by chemotactic\ncoupling, namely, assuming that one species produces a chemical agent which\ncauses the taxis of another species. It is known that in a one-species model\n(i.e. Keller-Segel model) production of chemoattractor results in formation of\nstationary periodic (or Turing-type) patterns.

Our QRAM design is compact, supports fast routing operations, and\navoids frequency crowding. Additionally, we propose a hybrid dual-rail encoding\nmethod to detect dominant loss errors without additional hardware, a versatile\napproach applicable to other QRAM platforms. Our estimates indicate that the\nproposed QRAM platform can achieve high heralding rates using current device\nparameters, with heralding fidelity primarily limited by transmon dephasing.",

This is\nrealized on crystals by a collinear compensated ordering of spins with a\ncharacteristic d, g or i-wave symmetry. Our Perspective goes beyond the theory\nof spin arrangements on crystals by connecting altermagnetism to basic notions\nin condensed matter physics. Specifically, we reflect on the analogies and\ndistinctions of altermagnetism as compared to superfluid 3He and theories of\nspin ordering in the momentum space generated by other higher-partial-wave\ninstabilities of a Fermi-liquid. On one hand, all these physical systems have\nin common the extraordinary combination of spontaneous breaking of spin-space\nand real-space rotation symmetries. On the other hand, we point out that there\nare key differences, both at the symmetry level and, particularly, at the level\nof microscopic mechanisms of ordering.

In particular, many\ncontain vertices that do not serve as least common ancestors (LCAs) for any\nsubset of the underlying genes or species, thus may lack direct support from\nthe observable data.

Moreover, it supports integrating multiple types of model\npriors and enables combining simpler ones to create more complex classes. Our\nevaluations on popular benchmarks involving both synthetic and real-world\ndynamic scenes demonstrate that augmenting current state-of-the-art methods\nwith our approach leads to a clear improvement in reconstruction accuracy.",

By considering the class of\nconstrained LTI systems with unknown time delays, we propose a set-theoretic\ndirect data-driven predictive controller that does not require a terminal cost\nto provide closed-loop guarantees. In particular, first, starting from\ninput/output data series, we propose a sample-based method to build N-step\ninput output backward reachable sets. Then, we leverage the constructed family\nof backward reachable sets to derive a data-driven control law. The proposed\nmethod guarantees finite-time convergence and recursive feasibility,\nindependent of objective function tuning. It requires neither explicit state\nestimation nor an explicit prediction model, relying solely on input-output\nmeasurements; therefore, unmodeled dynamics can be avoided.

As the significance of narratives for understanding current\nsocietal issues such as polarization and misinformation becomes increasingly\nevident, there is a growing demand for methods that support their empirical\nanalysis. To this end, we propose a graph-based formalism and machine-guided\nmethod for extracting, representing, and analyzing selected narrative signals\nfrom digital textual corpora, based on Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR).\nThe formalism and method introduced here specifically cater to the study of\npolitical narratives that figure in texts from digital media such as archived\npolitical speeches, social media posts, political manifestos and transcripts of\nparliamentary debates. We conceptualize these political narratives as a type of\nontological narratives: stories by which actors position themselves as\npolitical beings, and which are akin to political worldviews in which actors\npresent their normative vision of the world, or aspects thereof. We approach\nthe study of such political narratives as a problem of information retrieval:\nstarting from a textual corpus, we first extract a graph-like representation of\nthe meaning of each sentence in the corpus using AMR. Drawing on transferable\nconcepts from narratology, we then apply a set of heuristics to filter these\ngraphs for representations of 1) actors, 2) the events in which these actors\nfigure, and 3) traces of the perspectivization of these events. We approach\nthese references to actors, events, and instances of perspectivization as core\nnarrative signals that initiate a further analysis by alluding to larger\npolitical narratives. By means of a case study of State of the European Union\naddresses, we demonstrate how the formalism can be used to inductively surface\nsignals of political narratives from public discourse.",

In this work, we introduce\nReSpAct, an LLM-based agent designed to seamlessly integrate reasoning,\ndecision-making, and dynamic dialogue for task-solving. Expanding on\nreasoning-first approaches like ReAct, ReSpAct employs active, free-flowing\ndialogues to interpret instructions, clarify goals, provide status updates,\nresolve subtask failures, and refine plans based on user inputs without any\nexplicit dialogue schema. By alternating between task-solving actions and\ninteractive conversations, ReSpAct demonstrates improved performance across\ndiverse environments.

This allows us to efficiently implement a model\nreduction and assimilate data from a reference system state modeled by a highly\nresolved numerical solution of the rotating shallow water equation of order 104\ndegrees of freedom into a stochastic system having two orders of magnitude less\ndegrees of freedom. To do so, the new samples are incorporated into a particle\nfiltering methodology augmented with tempering and jittering for dynamic state\nestimation, a method particularly suited for handling complex and multimodal\ndistributions.

Theoretically, these networks can be described\nas space-embedded graphs, and rich structures that align well with observations\nemerge from optimizing their hydrodynamic energy dissipation. Studies on these\nmodels typically use regular grids and focus solely on edge width optimization.\nHere, we present a generalization of the hydrodynamic graph model which permits\nadditional optimization of node positioning. We achieve this by defining sink\nregions, accounting for the energy dissipation of delivery within these areas,\nand optimizing by means of differentiable physics. In the context of leaf\nvenation patterns, our method results in organic networks that adapt to\nirregularities of boundaries and node misalignment, as well as overall improved\nefficiency. We study the dependency of the emergent network structures on the\ncapillary delivery conductivity and identify a phase transition in which the\nnetwork collapses below a critical threshold.

We report results of a 3-part study covering 1) a\nreview of relevant metadata standards and a microscopy metadata framework\nshared by Hammer et al., 2) a baseline metadata alignment mapping current\ndiatom metadata properties to standard metadata types, and 3) a metadata risk\nanalysis associated with the course of standard data curation practices. This\nresearch is part of an effort involving the transfer of these digital slides to\nan new system, DataFed, to support global accessible. The final section of this\npaper includes a conclusion and discusses next steps.",

    "abstract": "Chromium depletion at grain boundaries (GBs) due to selective attack is a\ncritical issue in the molten salt corrosion of NiCr alloys. Despite the\nimportance of GBs in this process from numerous experimental studies, most\ntheoretical work has predominantly focused on fluorine interactions with\nidealized crystalline surfaces, neglecting the complexity of GB local\nenvironments. This study aims to bridge that gap by employing density\nfunctional theory (DFT) to investigate the atomic interactions and Cr\ndissolution mechanisms at GB in NiCr alloys under molten fluoride salt\nenvironments. Specifically, a $\\Sigma$5(210)/(001) symmetrical tilt GB is\nconstructed to explore the adsorption energies of fluorine on Ni(100) and\nCr-doped Ni(100) surfaces. We find that fluorine exhibits a strong preference\nfor binding at GB sites, with Cr doping amplifying this effect, leading to\nhigher adsorption energies compared to bulk Ni surfaces. Fluorine bonding with\nCr significantly alters the interaction between Cr-F complexes and Ni\nsubstrate, and the consequent dissolution barriers for Cr atoms; the formation\nof CrF$_3$ largely reduces the energy barrier for Cr dissolution. This work\nhighlights the essential role of GBs in enhancing fluorine adsorption and\naccelerating Cr depletion, providing new insights into the mechanisms of\nearly-stage corrosion in NiCr alloys.",

Herein, we systematically investigate the transport properties\nand thermoelectric performance concerning lattice distortions induced by\nhydrostatic pressure in Ag-based chalcopyrite AgXTe2 (X=In, Ga). The findings\nreveal that the lattice distortion in AgXTe2 exhibits distinct behaviors under\nlattice compression, diverging from trends observed at ambient pressure.\nImportantly, the hydrostatic pressure breaks the phenomenally negative\ncorrelation between thermal conductivity and lattice distortion.\nPressure-induced softening of low-frequency acoustic phonons broadens the\nlow-energy phonon spectrum, enhancing interactions between acoustic and optical\nphonons. Such broadening substantially increases the number of available\nthree-phonon scattering channels, resulting in a marked reduction in thermal\nconductivity. Meanwhile, we establish a macroscopic connection between\nmetavalent bonding and anharmonicity, providing an indirect explanation for\nlattice anharmonicity through pressure-driven transferred charge. Additionally,\nthe applied pressure achieves a notable net increase in the power factor\ndespite the strong coupling of electrical transport parameters, which\nunderscores the potential for bidirectional optimization of transport\nproperties in AgXTe2. As a result, the maximum ZT value of AgInTe2 is nearly\ndoubled, demonstrating that pressure modulation is a powerful strategy for\nenhancing thermoelectric performance. Our work not only establishes the link\nbetween pressure, lattice dynamics, and thermoelectric properties within\nchalcopyrite AgXTe2, but also inspires the exploration of pressure-related\noptimization strategies for conventional thermoelectric materials.",

Eight\nexperiments were conducted in a pre-clinical middle cerebral artery occlusion\n(MCAO) model. IVIM and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) imaging were\nacquired 2.5hr post-MCAO.

The properties of the clusters in the lowest-mass\ngalaxy bear a striking resemblance to those recently discovered by the James\nWebb Space Telescope (JWST) in the lensed Cosmic Gems arc system at $z = 10.2$.\nWe argue that, due to their extremely high stellar densities, intermediate-mass\nblack holes (IMBHs) would form rapidly inside the clusters, which would then\nswiftly sink and merge on their way to the galactic nucleus, easily growing a\n$10^7$~M$_{\\odot}$ supermassive black hole (SMBH). Due to the high fractional\nmass contribution of clusters to the stellar mass of the galaxies, in the range\n$20$-$40\\%$, the central SMBH would comprise more than $10\\%$ of the mass of\nits host galaxy, naturally explaining the overmassive SMBHs discovered by JWST\nat $z > 6$.",

This work proposes an\napproximation to cross-attention scoring based on vector quantization and\nenables compute- and memory-efficient use of large biasing catalogues. We\npropose to use this technique jointly with a retrieval based contextual biasing\napproach. First, we use an efficient quantized retrieval module to shortlist\nbiasing entries by grounding them on audio. Then we use retrieved entries for\nbiasing. Since the proposed approach is agnostic to the biasing method, we\ninvestigate using full cross-attention, LLM prompting, and a combination of the\ntwo.

Quantitative MRI\n(qMRI) can measure this evolution, distinguishing the physiological effects of\nnormal aging from pathological deviations.\n  Methods: We conducted a multicentre study using qMRI metrics (R1, R2*, and\nQuantitative Susceptibility Mapping) to model age trajectories across brain\nstructures, including tractography-based white matter bundles (TWMB),\nsuperficial white matter (SWM), and cortical grey matter (CGM). MRI data from\n537 healthy subjects, aged 8 to 79 years, were harmonized using two independent\nmethods. We modeled age trajectories and performed regional analyses to capture\nmaturation patterns and aging effects across the lifespan.\n  Findings: Our findings revealed a distinct brain maturation gradient, with\nearly qMRI peak values in TWMB, followed by SWM, and culminating in CGM\nregions. This gradient was observed as a posterior-to-anterior maturation\npattern in the cortex and an inferior-to-superior maturation pattern in white\nmatter tracts. R1 demonstrated the most robust age trajectories, while R2* and\nsusceptibility exhibited greater variability and different patterns. The\nnormative modeling framework confirmed the reliability of our age-modelled\ntrajectories across datasets.\n  Interpretation: Our study highlights the potential of multiparametric qMRI to\ncapture complex, region-specific brain development patterns, addressing the\nneed for comprehensive, age-spanning studies across multiple brain structures.\nVarious harmonization strategies can merge qMRI cohorts, improving the\nrobustness of qMRI-based age models and facilitating the understanding of\nnormal patterns and disease-associated deviations.",

Robotic systems having\ncontact with the environment can be modeled as hybrid systems. Controller\ndesign for hybrid systems under disturbances is complicated by the\ndiscontinuous jump dynamics, mode changes with inconsistent state dimensions,\nand variations in jumping timing and states caused by noise. We formulate this\nproblem into a stochastic control problem with hybrid transition constraints\nand propose the Hybrid Path Integral (H-PI) framework to obtain the optimal\ncontroller. Despite random mode changes across stochastic path samples, we show\nthat the ratio between hybrid path distributions with varying drift terms\nremains analogous to the smooth path distributions. We then show that the\noptimal controller can be obtained by evaluating a path integral with hybrid\nconstraints. Importance sampling for path distributions with hybrid dynamics\nconstraints is introduced to reduce the variance of the path integral\nevaluation, where we leverage the recently developed Hybrid\niterative-Linear-Quadratic-Regulator (H-iLQR) controller to induce a hybrid\npath distribution proposal with low variance.

In this work, we introduce a new\neigenvalue quantile estimation framework for some kernel matrices. This\nframework gives meaningful bounds for all the eigenvalues of a kernel matrix\nwhile avoiding the cost of constructing the full matrix. The kernel matrices\nunder consideration come from a kernel with quick decay away from the diagonal\napplied to uniformly-distributed sets of points in Euclidean space of any\ndimension. We prove the efficacy of this framework given certain bounds on the\nkernel function, and we provide empirical evidence for its accuracy.

To reach this goal\nwe introduce $z$-rings which turn out to be a useful tool to investigate these\nDiophantine equations. Moreover, we will extend these rings and study the\nalgebraic curves defined by them on a plane by methods inspired by the complex\nplane. Then we define the so called subbranches which are bounded and connected\nparts of the algebraic curves containing a representative of each solution of\nthe Diophantine equations with respect to association in $z$-rings. With the\nhelp of them we can easily prove the existence or non-existence of solutions to\nthe above Diophantine equations. Then we divide the integer primes with respect\nto the different $z$-rings into two main categories, i.e. the regular and\nirregular elements. We show that the irregular elements are prime in the\ncorresponding $z$-rings and we identify that most of the $z$-rings cannot be\nunique factorization domains. We determine the number of positive, primitive\nsolutions of the above Diophantine equation if $M \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is a product\nof irregular elements in the corresponding $z$-ring for $z \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We\nalso give an overview how many primitive and non-primitive solutions in a given\nquadrant we can find for arbitrary $M,z \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, especially, if $M$ is\na power of any irregular element. Furthermore, we consider the case $z = 3$,\ndetermine the regular and irregular elements as well as the number of positive,\nprimitive solutions of the Diophantine equation $x^2 + 3xy + y^2 = M$ depending\non $M \\in \\mathbb{N}$.",

With a\nconstant rate $r$, a previous time $\\tau$ between the initial time and the\npresent time $t$ is chosen from a given probability distribution $K(\\tau,t)$,\nand the particle is reset to the position that it occupied at time $\\tau$.\nDepending on the shape of $K(\\tau,t)$, the particle either relaxes toward the\nGibbs-Boltzmann distribution or toward a non-trivial stationary distribution\nthat breaks ergodicity and depends on the initial position and the resetting\nprotocol. From a general asymptotic theory, we find that if the kernel\n$K(\\tau,t)$ is sufficiently localized near $\\tau=0$, i.e., mostly the initial\npart of the trajectory is remembered and revisited, the steady state is\nnon-Gibbs-Boltzmann. Conversely, if $K(\\tau,t)$ decays slowly enough or\nincreases with $\\tau$, i.e., recent positions are more likely to be revisited,\nthe probability distribution of the particle tends toward the Gibbs-Boltzmann\nstate at large times. In the latter case, however, the temporal approach to the\nstationary state is generally anomalously slow, following for instance an\ninverse power law or a stretched exponential, if $K(\\tau,t)$ is not too\nstrongly peaked at the current time $t$.

    "abstract": "Ensuring usability is crucial for the success of mobile apps. Usability\nissues can compromise user experience and negatively impact the perceived app\nquality. This paper presents UX-LLM, a novel tool powered by a Large\nVision-Language Model that predicts usability issues in iOS apps. To evaluate\nthe performance of UX-LLM, we predicted usability issues in two open-source\napps of a medium complexity and asked two usability experts to assess the\npredictions. We also performed traditional usability testing and expert review\nfor both apps and compared the results to those of UX-LLM. UX-LLM demonstrated\nprecision ranging from 0.61 and 0.66 and recall between 0.35 and 0.38,\nindicating its ability to identify valid usability issues, yet failing to\ncapture the majority of issues. Finally, we conducted a focus group with an app\ndevelopment team of a capstone project developing a transit app for visually\nimpaired persons. The focus group expressed positive perceptions of UX-LLM as\nit identified unknown usability issues in their app. However, they also raised\nconcerns about its integration into the development workflow, suggesting\npotential improvements. Our results show that UX-LLM cannot fully replace\ntraditional usability evaluation methods but serves as a valuable supplement\nparticularly for small teams with limited resources, to identify issues in less\ncommon user paths, due to its ability to inspect the source code.",

Firstly, APM is designed to\nautomatically mix the source prototypes with the learnable prototypes with a\nsimilarity balancing factor, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Then, GSFS\ndynamically shifts the testing sample toward the source domain, mitigating\nerror accumulation in an online manner. In addition, CPR is proposed to pull\nthe nearest learnable prototype close to the testing feature and push it away\nfrom other prototypes, making each prototype distinguishable during the\nadaptation. Experimental comparisons lead to a new benchmark, demonstrating\nPCoTTA's superiority in boosting the model's transferability towards the\ncontinually changing target domain.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in\nvarious computer vision tasks, including image and video analysis. However,\nTransformer's complex architecture and black-box nature pose challenges for\nexplainability, a crucial aspect for real-world applications and scientific\ninquiry. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods can only provide one-dimensional\nfeature importance, either spatial or temporal explanation, with significant\ncomputational complexity. This paper introduces STAA (Spatio-Temporal Attention\nAttribution), an XAI method for interpreting video Transformer models. Differ\nfrom traditional methods that separately apply image XAI techniques for spatial\nfeatures or segment contribution analysis for temporal aspects, STAA offers\nboth spatial and temporal information simultaneously from attention values in\nTransformers. The study utilizes the Kinetics-400 dataset, a benchmark\ncollection of 400 human action classes used for action recognition research. We\nintroduce metrics to quantify explanations. We also apply optimization to\nenhance STAA's raw output. By implementing dynamic thresholding and attention\nfocusing mechanisms, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio in our explanations,\nresulting in more precise visualizations and better evaluation results. In\nterms of computational overhead, our method requires less than 3\\% of the\ncomputational resources of traditional XAI methods, making it suitable for\nreal-time video XAI analysis applications. STAA contributes to the growing\nfield of XAI by offering a method for researchers and practitioners to analyze\nTransformer models.",

First, we extend the contemporary probability\ntheory on trees to investigate critical phenomena in a stochastic model of Yule\ntype called Aldous-Shields-Athreya (ASA) cascade. Second, we apply the newly\ndeveloped probabilistic framework to problems of uniqueness and nonuniqueness\nof solutions to the linear and nonlinear mean flow equations, referred to as\nthe pantograph equation and $\\alpha$-Riccati equation, respectively. The\nstochastic processes associated with these equations are related to each other\nvia a one-parameter family of transformations. Remarkably, these simple\ntransformations lead to infinitely many solutions to the initial-value problem\nof the nonlinear mean flow equation. Despite being non-explicit at the level of\nmean flow, their effect on the mean flow equations is reminiscent of how the\nCole-Hopf transformation maps solutions of the heat equation to those of the\nBurgers equation. While the ASA cascade has been used to model percolation,\nageing, and data compression, its relevance to any specific physical molecular\ndynamics is unclear to the authors. Nevertheless, our results highlight how\nsimple stochastic-level transformations can uncover significant macroscopic\nstructures. This principle is exemplified by the connection between spontaneous\nmagnetization and shocks in the Burgers equation (Newman 1986) or the\nconnection between the branching Brownian motion and the KPP equation (McKean\n1975). In our model, the breakdown of uniqueness in mean flow solutions\ncorresponds to critical phenomena in the ASA cascade such as stochastic\nexplosion, hyperexplosion, and percolation.",

These\nobservations probe an unprecedented extinction depth, reaching $A_V\\sim$ 40-60\nmag in these dense cloud cores. We derive color-excess ratios\n$E(K-\\lambda)/E(H-K)$ by fitting color-color diagrams of $(K-\\lambda)$ versus\n$(H-K)$, which are subsequently used to calculate the extinction law\n$A_\\lambda/A_K$. Our analysis reveals remarkably similar and exceptionally flat\ninfrared extinction curves for all four cloud cores, exhibiting the most\npronounced flattening reported in the literature to date. This flatness is\nconsistent with the presence of large dust grains, suggesting significant grain\ngrowth in dense environments.

The target\nparameter of the database specifies a finite number of goals $Goal_k$, for each\nof which the algorithm constructs association rules of the form $X \\Rightarrow\nGoal_k$. The quality of the generated rules is characterized by five criteria:\ntwo represent rule frequency, two reflect rule reliability, and the fifth is a\nweighted sum of these four criteria.\n  The algorithm initially generates rules with single premises, where the\ncorrelation criterion between the premise $X$ and the conclusion $Goal_k$\nexceeds a specified threshold. Then, rules with extended premises are built\nbased on the anti-monotonicity of rule frequency criteria and the monotonicity\nof rule reliability criteria. Newly constructed rules tend to decrease in\nfrequency while increasing in reliability. The article proves several\nstatements that justify the rule construction process.\n  The algorithm enables the construction of both high-frequency and rare rules\nwith low occurrence frequency but high reliability. It also allows for the\ngeneration of negative rules with negative correlation between the premise and\nconclusion, which can be valuable in practical applications for filtering out\nundesired goals.\n  The efficiency of the algorithm is based on two factors: the method of\nencoding the database and its partitioning into subsets linked to the target\nparameter.

Optimal transport\n(OT) theory provides a principled framework for constructing such mappings by\nminimizing transport cost. Recently, Wasserstein-2 ($W_2$) neural optimal\ntransport solvers (\\textit{e.g.}, CellOT) have been employed for this\nprediction task. However, $W_2$ OT relies on the general Kantorovich dual\nformulation, which involves optimizing over two conjugate functions, leading to\na complex min-max optimization problem that converges slowly. \\\\\n\\textbf{Results:} To address these challenges, we propose a novel solver based\non the Wasserstein-1 ($W_1$) dual formulation. Unlike $W_2$, the $W_1$ dual\nsimplifies the optimization to a maximization problem over a single 1-Lipschitz\nfunction, thus eliminating the need for time-consuming min-max optimization.\nWhile solving the $W_1$ dual only reveals the transport direction and does not\ndirectly provide a unique optimal transport map, we incorporate an additional\nstep using adversarial training to determine an appropriate transport step\nsize, effectively recovering the transport map. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed $W_1$ neural optimal transport solver can mimic the $W_2$ OT\nsolvers in finding a unique and ``monotonic\" map on 2D datasets. Moreover, the\n$W_1$ OT solver achieves performance on par with or surpasses $W_2$ OT solvers\non real single-cell perturbation datasets. Furthermore, we show that $W_1$ OT\nsolver achieves $25 \\sim 45\\times$ speedup, scales better on high dimensional\ntransportation task, and can be directly applied on single-cell RNA-seq dataset\nwith highly variable genes. \\\\ \\textbf{Availability and Implementation:} Our\nimplementation and experiments are open-sourced at\nhttps://github.com/poseidonchan/w1ot.",

Because sampling is tractable, DPPs are natural\ncandidates for subsampling tasks, such as minibatch selection or coreset\nconstruction. A \\emph{coreset} is a subset of a (large) training set, such that\nminimizing an empirical loss averaged over the coreset is a controlled\nreplacement for the intractable minimization of the original empirical loss.\nTypically, the control takes the form of a guarantee that the average loss over\nthe coreset approximates the total loss uniformly across the parameter space.\nRecent work has provided significant empirical support in favor of using DPPs\nto build randomized coresets, coupled with interesting theoretical results that\nare suggestive but leave some key questions unanswered. In particular, the\ncentral question of whether the cardinality of a DPP-based coreset is\nfundamentally smaller than one based on independent sampling remained open. In\nthis paper, we answer this question in the affirmative, demonstrating that\n\\emph{DPPs can provably outperform independently drawn coresets}. In this vein,\nwe contribute a conceptual understanding of coreset loss as a \\emph{linear\nstatistic} of the (random) coreset. We leverage this structural observation to\nconnect the coresets problem to a more general problem of concentration\nphenomena for linear statistics of DPPs, wherein we obtain \\emph{effective\nconcentration inequalities that extend well-beyond the state-of-the-art},\nencompassing general non-projection, even non-symmetric kernels.

Compared\nwith the best high-end GPU modified baseline Byte (Embed) and the best existing\nbaseline on embedded devices MobileNet-JDE, HopTrack achieves a processing\nspeed of up to 39.29 fps on NVIDIA AGX Xavier with a multi-object tracking\naccuracy (MOTA) of up to 63.12% on the MOT16 benchmark, outperforming both\ncounterparts by 2.15% and 4.82%, respectively. Additionally, the accuracy\nimprovement is coupled with the reduction in energy consumption (20.8%), power\n(5%), and memory usage (8%), which are crucial resources on embedded devices.\nHopTrack is also detector agnostic allowing the flexibility of plug-and-play.",

    "abstract": "Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are prone to radiation damage which causes\nan increase of dark count rate. This leads to an increase in low-energy\nthreshold in a gamma-ray detector combining SiPM and a scintillator. Despite\nthis drawback, they are becoming preferred for scintillator-based gamma-ray\ndetectors on CubeSats due to their low operation voltage, small size, linear\nresponse to low light intensity and fast response. This increasing popularity\nof SiPMs among new spaceborne missions makes it important to characterize their\nlong-term performance in the space environment. In this work, we report the\nchange of the dark count rate and low-energy threshold of S13360-3050 PE\nmulti-pixel photon counters (MPPCs) by Hamamatsu, using measurements acquired\nby the GRBAlpha and VZLUSAT-2 CubeSats at low Earth orbit (LEO) spanning over\nthree years. Such a long measurement of the performance of MPPCs in space has\nnot been published before. GRBAlpha is a 1U CubeSat launched on March 22, 2021,\nto a 550 km altitude sun-synchronous polar orbit (SSO) carrying on board a\ngamma-ray detector based on CsI(Tl) scintillator readout by eight MPPCs and\nregularly detecting gamma-ray transients such as gamma-ray bursts and solar\nflares in the energy range of ~30-900 keV. VZLUSAT-2 is a 3U CubeSat launched\non January 13, 2022 also to a 535 km altitude SSO carrying on board, among\nother payloads, two gamma-ray detectors similar to the one on GRBAlpha. We have\nflight-proven the Hamamatsu MPPCs S13360-3050 PE and demonstrated that MPPCs,\nshielded by 2.5 mm of PbSb alloy, can be used in LEO environment on a\nscientific mission lasting beyond three years. This manifests the potential of\nMPPCs being employed in future satellites.",

    "abstract": "Social network platforms like Reddit are increasingly impacting real-world\neconomics. Meme stocks are a recent phenomena where price movements are driven\nby retail investors organizing themselves via social networks. To study the\nimpact of social networks on meme stocks, the first step is to analyze these\nnetworks. Going forward, predicting meme stocks' returns would require to\npredict dynamic interactions first. This is different from conventional link\nprediction, frequently applied in e.g. recommendation systems. For this task,\nit is essential to predict more complex interaction dynamics, such as the exact\ntiming. These are crucial for linking the network to meme stock price\nmovements. Dynamic graph embedding (DGE) has recently emerged as a promising\napproach for modeling dynamic graph-structured data. However, current negative\nsampling strategies, an important component of DGE, are designed for\nconventional dynamic link prediction and do not capture the specific patterns\npresent in meme stock-related social networks. This limits the training and\nevaluation of DGE models in such social networks. To overcome this drawback, we\npropose novel negative sampling strategies based on the analysis of real meme\nstock-related social networks and financial knowledge. Our experiments show\nthat the proposed negative sampling strategies can better evaluate and train\nDGE models targeted at meme stock-related social networks compared to existing\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the Internet has been dominated by content-rich platforms,\nemploying recommendation systems to provide users with more appealing content\n(e.g., videos in YouTube, movies in Netflix). While traditional content\nrecommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of\nNetwork-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content\nthat improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still\nbeing appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their\ngoal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users. The undesirable\nside-effect is reduced content diversity, a phenomenon known as\n``content/filter bubble''. This reduced diversity is problematic for both\nusers, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content\ncreators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently,\nleading to perceived unfairness. In this paper, we first investigate - using\nreal data and state-of-the-art NFR schemes - the extent of this phenomenon. We\nthen formulate a ``Diverse-NFR'' optimization problem (i.e., network-friendly\nrecommendations with - sufficient - content diversity), and through a series of\ntransformation steps, we manage to reduce it to a linear program that can be\nsolved fast and optimally. Our findings show that Diverse-NFR can achieve high\nnetwork gains (comparable to non-diverse NFR) while maintaining diversity\nconstraints. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates\ndiversity issues into network-friendly recommendation algorithms.",

Seventeen OARs\nwere delineated: nine by clinicians (Type 1) and eight using TotalSegmentator\n(Type 2).

For open systems, we demonstrate that a supercritical external\nflux divergence stabilizes the system, preventing decomposition.

It enables us to amplify or\nsuppress the outgoing waves via engineering amplitudes and phases of multiple\nincidences. However, within a purely spatially (temporally) engineered medium,\ncoherent wave control requires the frequency of the associated incidences to be\nidentical (opposite). In this work, we break this conventional constraint by\ngeneralizing coherent wave control into a spatiotemporally engineered medium,\ni.e., the system featuring a dynamic interface. Owing to the broken\ntranslational symmetry in space and time, both the subluminal and superluminal\ninterfaces allow interference between scattered waves regardless of their\ndifferent frequencies and wavevectors. Hence, one can flexibly eliminate the\nbackward- or forward-propagating waves scattered from the dynamic interfaces by\ncontrolling the incident amplitudes and phases. Our work not only presents a\ngeneralized way for reshaping arbitrary waveforms but also provides a promising\nparadigm to generate ultrafast pulses using low-frequency signals.

It dominates many other\nscheduling algorithms for mixed-criticality systems, but does so at the cost of\noccasionally dropping jobs of less important/critical tasks, when low-priority\njobs overrun their time budgets. In this paper we enhance AMC with a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) approach based on a Deep-Q Network. The DRL agent\nis trained off-line, and at run-time adjusts the low-criticality budgets of\ntasks to avoid budget overruns, while ensuring that no job misses its deadline\nif it does not overrun its budget. We have implemented and evaluated this\napproach by simulating realistic workloads from the automotive domain. The\nresults show that the agent is able to reduce budget overruns by at least up to\n50%, even when the budget of each task is chosen based on sampling the\ndistribution of its execution time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst use of DRL in AMC reported in the literature.",

Most importantly, it\nremains unclear how to form platoons of passenger cars in order to optimize the\npersonal benefit for the individual driver. To this end, in this paper, we\npropose a novel platoon formation algorithm that optimizes the personal benefit\nfor drivers of individual passenger cars. For computing vehicle-to-platoon\nassignments, the algorithm utilizes a new metric that we propose to evaluate\nthe personal benefits of various driving systems, including platooning. By\ncombining fuel and travel time costs into a single monetary value, drivers can\nestimate overall trip costs according to a personal monetary value for time\nspent. This provides an intuitive way for drivers to understand and compare the\nbenefits of driving systems like human driving, adaptive cruise control (ACC),\nand, of course, platooning. Unlike previous similarity-based methods, our\nproposed algorithm forms platoons only when beneficial for the driver, rather\nthan solely for platooning. We demonstrate the new metric for the total trip\ncost in a numerical analysis and explain its interpretation. Results of a\nlarge-scale simulation study demonstrate that our proposed platoon formation\nalgorithm outperforms normal ACC as well as previous similarity-based\nplatooning approaches by balancing fuel savings and travel time, independent of\ntraffic and drivers' time cost.",

In this paper, we investigate the\ngeodesic motion of both massive test particles and photons in the vicinity of\nHBH with $\\phi_1=0.5$ and $\\phi_1=1.0$ by analyzing their effective potentials\nderived from the geodesic equation. By fixing $\\phi_1$, the effective potential\nof a massive test particle increases monotonically when its angular momentum\n$L$ is very small. When $L$ increases to a critical value, the effective\npotential possesses an inflection point which is known as the innermost stable\nof circular orbit (ISCO), where the test particle can still remain stable in a\ncircular orbit with a minimal radius without being absorbed by the HBH or\nfleeing to infinity. Beyond the critical value of $L$, the effective potential\npossesses a local minimum and a local maximum, indicating the existence of\nunstable and stable circular orbits, respectively. Moreover, the HBH possesses\nan unstable photon sphere but its location slightly deviates from the\nSchwarzschild black hole. The trajectories of null geodesics in the vicinity of\nHBH can also be classified into three types, which are the direct, lensing and\nphoton sphere, based on the deflection angle of light, but the values of impact\nparameters can vary significantly than the Schwarzschild black hole.",

For expected rewards, we investigate how to bound the path\nreward distribution to apply sound statistical methods for bounded\ndistributions, of which we recommend the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality\nthat has not been used in SMC so far. We prove that even reachability rewards\ncan be bounded in theory, and formalise the concept of limit-PAC procedures for\na practical solution.

This means\nthat under ideal conditions -- where the network is synchronous, and all chain\nproposers, along with more than two-thirds of the validators, behave as\ndictated by the protocol -- proposers construct blocks on a non-finalized chain\nthat extends at least 64 blocks. This exposes a significant portion of the\nblockchain to potential reorganizations during changes in network conditions,\nsuch as periods of asynchrony.

Furthermore, the extended finalization\nperiod forces users to balance the trade-off between economic security and\ntransaction speed.\n  To address these issues and speed up finality, we introduce a partially\nsynchronous finality gadget, which we combine with two dynamically available\nconsensus protocols -- synchronous protocols that ensure safety and liveness\neven with fluctuating validator participation levels.

Second, we apply a continuation strategy to control the\nregularization parameter to improve the behavior of (damped) Newton methods.\nThird, we combine Newton's method with a domain-decomposition-based nonlinear\npreconditioning, which improves its robustness properties and allows for\nparallelization. The efficiency of the proposed numerical framework is\ndemonstrated by extensive numerical experiments.",

The integration of\nhigh shares of renewables into the energy system is central to both policy\nmaking and research, focusing on the need for balancing options between vRES\nand demand. In this work we analyze and compare three key integration measures:\ngrid expansions, electricity storage, and the role of production, storage and\ntransport of low-carbon hydrogen. We focus on their potential to reduce\nemissions and energy system costs, individually and in combination. We take the\nNorth Sea as an exemplary region with ambitious 2030-2040 targets for offshore\nwind developments. The projections on installed generation and grid capacities,\nalong with demand estimates from the Ten Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP)\n2022, serve as a starting point for our energy system model. This starting\nmodel can then be further expanded with the three integration measures. Our\nfindings show that grid expansions across the North Sea are a no-regret measure\nlowering costs, emissions and required renewable. The production of hydrogen\nand its direct use in industry has a lower cost reduction potential and\nemission reduction potential, while hydrogen storage and transport have little\nto no additional value. In the short term (2030), electricity storage can help\nto reduce emissions, but it is not cost competitive. In the longer term (2040),\nstorage can help to balance investments in vRES assets by providing additional\nflexibility to the system. Combining the three integration measures provides\nadditional benefits. The highest emission reductions can be achieved by\ncombining electricity storage with an expansion of the grid. The highest\neconomic benefits can be achieved with a combination of grid expansions and\nhydrogen production for direct use in industry.",

The reason of this phenomenon\nis unclear, thus it is necessary to carry out observational studies of\nsulfur-bearing species towards dense regions, mainly at early evolutive stages\nto uncover the early sulfur chemistry. Using data from the Atacama Large\nMillimeter Array (ALMA) data archive, we investigated a sample of 37 dense\ncores embedded in the most massive infrared-quiet molecular clumps from the\nATLASGAL survey. Lines of 34SO, SO2, NS, SO, SO+, and H2CS were analyzed and\ncolumn densities of each molecular species were obtained. From the continuum\nemission, and two CH3OH lines, the 37 cores were characterized in density and\ntemperature, and the corresponding H2 column densities were derived. The\nabundances of such sulfur-bearing species were derived and studied. We find\nthat the abundances of the analyzed species increase with the growth of the gas\ntemperature, suggesting that the chemistry involved in the formation of each of\nthe analyzed molecule may have a similar dependence with Tk in the range 20 to\n100 K. We find that the comparisons among abundances are, in general, highly\ncorrelated. Given that such correlation decreases in more evolved sources, we\nsuggest that the sulfur-bearing species here analyzed should have a similar\nchemical origin. From the measured line widths we point out that molecules with\noxygen content (34SO, SO2, SO, and SO+) may be associated with warmer and more\nturbulent gas than the other ones. H2CS and NS are associated with more\nquiescent gas, probably in the external envelopes of the cores.

We demonstrate\nhow cross-correlating large-scale structure (LSS) tracers with the GWB spatial\nanisotropies can extract a clear astrophysical imprint from the GWB signal.\nFocusing on the unresolved population of supermassive black hole binaries\n(SMBHBs) as the primary source for the GWB at nanohertz frequencies, we\nconstruct full-sky maps of galaxy distributions and characteristic strain of\nthe GWB to explore the relationship between GWB anisotropies and the LSS. We\nfind that at current pulsar timing array (PTA) sensitivities, very few loud\nSMBHBs act as Poisson-like noise.

In\ncontrast, we find that the bulk of the unresolved SMBHBs produce anisotropies\nwhich mirror the spatial distribution of galaxies, and thus trace the LSS.\nImportantly, we show that cross-correlations are required to retrieve a clear\nLSS imprint in the GWB.

    "abstract": "When supercooled, liquids viscosity increases dramatically as the glass\ntransition temperature is approached. While the physical origin of this\nbehavior is still not understood, it is now well established that the addition\nof a few activated particles is able to reverse that increase in viscosity.\nHere we further raise the question of a limit in that fluidization process and\nof the differences between the fluidized liquid and its viscous counterpart.\nResults show that a few percent active molecules are enough to trigger a phase\ntransition leading to diffusion coefficients typical of liquids while the\nmedium retains cooperative properties of the viscous phase. The similarity\nbetween cooperative properties of the active and non active molecules suggests\nthat the mobility of active molecules is transmitted to inactive ones via the\nmedium cooperative mechanisms, a result in agreement with facilitation\ntheories. This result is then confirmed by the compared behavior of the\ndistinct van hove correlation functions of most mobile active and non active\nmolecules. Interestingly enough, in our simulations the cooperative mechanisms\nare not induced or related to a decrease of the excitation concentration.",

However,\ntaking into account inversion symmetry breaking by the bias field, the\ncircularly polarized light can excite photocarriers with asymmetric momentum\ndistribution, which generates injection current transverse to the bias field.\nTherefore, the field-induced circular photogalvanic effect (FI-CPGE) should\nalso emerge in the very same experimental configuration for light-induced\nanomalous Hall effect but has been overlooked in literature. In this work,\nusing terahertz pulses as a bias field for a semiconductor GaAs, we conduct\ntwo-dimensional Fourier analysis and demonstrate that FI-CPGE can play a major\nrole in the photovoltaic Hall response. Counterintuitively, FI-CPGE is\nsignificantly enhanced when the photocarriers are excited near the bandgap with\nsmall density of states and low group velocity, which can be explained by a\nthree-level resonant nonlinear interaction near the band degeneracy point. We\nalso clarified that FI-CPGE would be further largely detected in the\ncontact-type measurement using electrodes because of the absence of a filtering\neffect inherent to terahertz pulses.

The multimodal VAE integrates inputs from\ndifferent modalities at two points in time in the latent space and can thereby\nbe used as a controller for a robotic agent.

The VAE is trained via the evidence lower bound,\nwhich can be written as a sum of two different terms, namely the reconstruction\nand the latent loss.

The model incorporates non-metricity and boundary contributions to\nthe total action, represented by the scalar quantities $Q$ and $C$. The\nviscosity in the dark energy fluid is modeled to understand the impact of bulk\nviscosity on cosmic expansion and the late-time acceleration of the universe.\nWe derive the field equations using the modified FLRW metric and analyze the\nbehavior of key cosmological parameters, including the energy density,\npressure, and the equation of state (EoS) parameter. The effective EoS\nparameter is also studied in the context of cosmic evolution. We impose\nobservational constraints on the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ using recent datasets\nfrom DESI-Y1, SDSS-IV, Pantheon+ (without SHOES calibration), and cosmic\nchronometer measurements. The analysis shows that the model effectively\ndescribes the universe's expansion history and predicts a transition from\ndeceleration to acceleration, consistent with observational data.

This study specifically focuses on\nSOT-driven DWs in near Bloch-states, which we refer to as ``quasi-Bloch DWs\".\nThese quasi-Bloch DWs exhibit slower motion compared to Neel-type DWs, offering\npotential for achieving highly controllable DW positions. Here, we investigate\nthe characteristics of SOT-driven motion of quasi-Bloch DWs in perpendicularly\nmagnetized ultra-thin films consisting of W/CoFeB/MgO. For analyzing the DW\nmotion, we employ a one-dimensional model incorporating parameters derived from\nexperimental data obtained from our samples. Our model successfully reproduces\nthe experimental results, which reveal variations in the direction and\nthreshold current density of DW motion among different samples. Through\ntheoretical analysis, we unveil that the DW remains in quasi-Bloch states\nduring motion, with SOT serving as the primary driving force rather than spin\ntransfer torque (STT). The direction of motion is determined not only by the\nsign combination of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and spin Hall angle\nbut also by the strength of DMI, STT, and extrinsic DW pinning. Furthermore, we\nprovide analytical expressions for the threshold current density required for\nSOT-driven quasi-Bloch DW motion.

We address\nthis by exploring an underexplored area of DRL for inventory management:\ntraining generally capable agents (GCAs) under zero-shot generalization (ZSG).\nHere, GCAs are advanced DRL policies designed to handle a broad range of\nsampled problem instances with diverse inventory challenges.

The TED framework consists of\nthree phases: training a GCA on varied problem instances, continuously\nestimating problem parameters during deployment, and making decisions based on\nthese estimates. Applied to periodic review inventory problems with lost sales,\ncyclic demand patterns, and stochastic lead times, our trained agent, the\nGenerally Capable Lost Sales Network (GC-LSN) consistently outperforms\nwell-known traditional policies when problem parameters are known. Moreover,\nunder conditions where demand and/or lead time distributions are initially\nunknown and must be estimated, we benchmark against online learning methods\nthat provide worst-case performance guarantees.

To solve this task, some\nmethods divide the original problem into several sub-problems (local approach),\nothers learn all labels at once (global approach), and others combine several\nclassifiers (ensemble approach). Regardless of the approach used, exploring and\nlearning label correlations is important to improve the classifier predictions.\nEnsemble of Classifier Chains (ECC) is a well-known multi-label method that\nconsiders label correlations and can achieve good overall performance on\nseveral multi-label datasets and evaluation measures. However, one of the\nchallenges when working with ECC is the high dimensionality of the label space,\nwhich can impose limitations for fully-cascaded chains as the complexity\nincreases regarding feature space expansion. To improve classifier chains, we\npropose a method to chain disjoint correlated label clusters obtained by\napplying a partition method in the label space. During the training phase, the\nground truth labels of each cluster are used as new features for all of the\nfollowing clusters. During the test phase, the predicted labels of clusters are\nused as new features for all the following clusters. Our proposal, called Label\nCluster Chains for Multi-Label Classification (LCC-ML), uses multi-label Random\nForests as base classifiers in each cluster, combining their predictions to\nobtain a final multi-label classification. Our proposal obtained better results\ncompared to the original ECC. This shows that learning and chaining disjoint\ncorrelated label clusters can better explore and learn label correlations.",

We posit that natural language offers an\nintuitive and accessible interface for robot learning. To this end, we study\ntwo aspects: (1) enabling non-experts to collect robotic data through natural\nlanguage supervision (e.g., \"move the arm to the right\") and (2) training robot\npolicies directly from this supervision. Specifically, we introduce a data\ncollection framework that collects robot demonstrations based on natural\nlanguage supervision and further augments these demonstrations. We then present\nCLIP-RT, a new vision-language-action (VLA) model that learns\nlanguage-conditioned visuomotor policies from this supervision. CLIP-RT adapts\nthe pretrained CLIP model and learns to predict language-based motion\nprimitives via contrastive imitation learning. We train CLIP-RT on the Open\nX-Embodiment dataset and finetune it on in-domain data collected by our\nframework. In real-world evaluations, CLIP-RT demonstrates strong capabilities\nin learning novel manipulation skills, outperforming OpenVLA (7B parameters) by\n24% in average success rates, while using 7x fewer parameters (1B).

We show that $\\mathrm{S}(R)$ is an abstract Cu-semigroup whenever $R$ is\nleft normal and, for such rings, the assignment $R\\mapsto \\mathrm{S}(R)$ is\ncontinuous. We prove a parallel result for $\\Lambda(R)$ whenever $R$ is a dense\nring.",

    "abstract": "Subspace identification method (SIM) has been proven to be very useful and\nnumerically robust for estimating state-space models. However, it is in general\nnot believed to be as accurate as the prediction error method (PEM).\nConversely, PEM, although more accurate, comes with non-convex optimization\nproblems and requires local non-linear optimization algorithms and good\ninitialization points. This contribution proposes a weighted null space fitting\n(WNSF) method to identify a state-space model, combining some advantages of the\ntwo mainstream approaches aforementioned. It starts with the estimate of a\nnon-parametric model using least-squares, and then the reduction to a\nstate-space model in the observer canonical form is a multi-step least-squares\nprocedure where each step consists of the solution of a quadratic optimization\nproblem. Unlike SIM, which focuses on the range space of the extended\nobservability matrix, WNSF estimates its null space, avoiding the need for\nsingular value decomposition. Moreover, the statistically optimal weighting for\nthe null space fitting problem is derived. It is conjectured that WNSF is\nasymptotically efficient, which is supported by a simulation study.",

Here we report an Active\nLearning enhanced Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization algorithm,\nintegrated with hydrothermal simulations in fractured media, to enable\nefficient optimization of fractured geothermal systems using few model\nevaluations. We introduce probabilistic neural network as classifier to learns\nto predict the Pareto dominance relationship between candidate samples and\nreference samples, thereby facilitating the identification of promising but\nuncertain offspring solutions. We then use active learning strategy to conduct\nhypervolume based attention subspace search with surrogate model by iteratively\ninfilling informative samples within local promising parameter subspace. We\ndemonstrate its effectiveness by conducting extensive experimental tests of the\nintegrated framework, including multi-objective benchmark functions, a\nfractured geothermal model and a large-scale enhanced geothermal system.\nResults demonstrate that the ALEMO approach achieves a remarkable reduction in\nrequired simulations, with a speed-up of 1-2 orders of magnitude (10-100 times\nfaster) than traditional evolutionary methods, thereby enabling accelerated\ndecision-making.

Advances in strong light-matter\ncoupling in molecular systems have opened new possibilities to control energy\ntransfer. In particular, long-distance energy transfer between molecules has\nbeen reported as the result of their mutual coupling to cavity photon modes,\nand the formation of hybrid polariton states. In addition to strong coupling to\nlight, molecular systems also show strong interactions between electronic and\nvibrational modes. The latter can act as a reservoir for energy to facilitate\noff-resonant transitions, and thus energy relaxation between polaritonic states\nat different energies. However, the non-Markovian nature of those modes makes\nit challenging to accurately simulate these effects. Here we capture them via\nprocess tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) methods, to describe exactly\nthe vibrational environment of the molecules combined with a mean-field\ntreatment of the light-matter interaction. In particular, we study the emission\ndynamics of a system consisting of two spatially separated layers of different\nspecies of molecules coupled to a common photon mode, and show that the\nstrength of coupling to the vibrational bath plays a crucial role in governing\nthe dynamics of the energy of the emitted light; at strong vibrational coupling\nthis dynamics shows strongly non-Markovian effects, eventually leading to\npolaron formation.

    "abstract": "The perspective that gravity may govern the unification of all known\nelementary forces calls for an extension of the gauge gravity symmetry group\n$SL(2,C)$ to the broader local symmetry $SL(2N,C)$, where $N$ reflects the\ninternal $SU(N)$ symmetry subgroup. This extension is shown to lead to a\nconsistent hyperunification framework, provided that the tetrad fields of $%\nSL(2,C)$ retain their invertibility condition in the extended theory, thus\nmaintaining their connection to gravity. As a result -- while the full gauge\nmultiplet of $SL(2N,C)$ typically comprises vector, axial-vector and tensor\nfield submultiplets of $SU(N)$ -- only the vector submultiplet and singlet\ntensor field may manifest in an observed particle spectrum. Consequently, the\neffective symmetry of the theory reduces to $SL(2,C)\\times SU(N)$, bringing\ntogether $SL(2,C)$ gauge gravity and $SU(N)$ grand unification. As all states\nin $SL(2N,C)$ are also classified by their spin magnitudes, some $SU(N)$ grand\nunified models, including the standard $SU(5)$% , appear unsuitable for the\nstandard spin-$1/2$ quarks and leptons. However, applying $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry\nto a model of composite quarks and leptons, where constituent chiral preons\nform the fundamental representations, identifies $SL(16,C)$ with its effective\n$SL(2,C)\\times SU(8)$ symmetry accommodating all three quark-lepton families,\nas the most compelling candidate for hyperunification of the existing\nfundamental forces.",

The uplink (UL) paths in HRF, comprising both direct and reflected\nsignals within the same frequency band, pose unique challenges, particularly\ngiven that the reflected signal is often significantly weaker than the direct\npath, making HRF systems susceptible to ADC resolution. To investigate the\ninfluence of quantization and ADC resolution on HRF, we employ the quantized\nCram\\'er-Rao bound (CRB) as a metric for sensing accuracy. This work derives\nthe quantized CRB specifically for HRF systems and the quantized communication\nrate.

Using these derived bounds, we analyze the quantized HRF system\nthrough the lens of CRB-rate boundaries.

The aim of the\npresent study is to place firm observational constraints on the formation\npathways leading to formamide thanks to new interferometric observations of the\nmolecular outflow driven by the protostellar binary L1157. We employed the IRAM\nNOEMA interferometer to map the entire southern outflow of L1157, which\ncontains three main shocked regions with increasing post-shock age: B0, B1, and\nB2. This allowed us to measure how the abundance of formamide, that of\nacetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO), and the ratio of the two, vary with time in this\nregion. In order to gain a greater understanding of the most likely formation\nroutes of formamide, we ran a grid of astrochemical models and compared these\nto our observations. A comparison between observations and astrochemical\nmodelling indicates that there are two possible scenarios: one in which the\namount of formamide observed can be explained by gas-phase-only chemistry, and\nmore specifically via the reaction H$_2$CO + NH$_2$ $\\rightarrow$ NH$_2$CHO +\nH$_2$, and another in which part of the observed formamide originates from\nsurface chemistry and part from gas-phase chemistry. Surface chemistry alone\ncannot account for the abundance of formamide that we measure.

They appear naturally in the representation\ntheory of algebras, but in recent years they have also found applications in\nother areas of mathematics, including symplectic topology, complex analysis,\nand topological data analysis, where they arise from filtrations of topological\nspaces by the sublevel sets of real-valued functions. Two fundamental\nproperties of persistence modules make them useful in such contexts: (1) the\nfact that they are stable under perturbations of the originating functions, and\n(2) the fact that they can be approximated, in the sense of relative\nhomological algebra, by classes of indecomposable modules with an elementary\nstructure. In this text we give an introduction to the theory of persistence\nmodules, then we explain how the above properties can be leveraged to build a\nframework for differential calculus and optimization with convergence\nguarantees in persistence module categories.",

A previous IceCube analysis has shown a reduced trigger\nefficiency in detecting FCP with a charge of e/3 due to the $\\text{z}^2$\ndependence of photon production processes. The FPT addresses this shortcoming\nby incorporating a so far unused hit type, so called SLC hits in the trigger\ndecision. These are single isolated hits that are not used for triggering high\nenergy signatures in IceCube. The FPT employs a sliding time window to analyze\nhits, utilizing four cuts to remove noise and bright background contributions.\nThe noise contribution is effectively decreased to a few Hz by velocity and\ndirectional consistency of hit pairs. Furthermore a part of the dominating\natmospheric muon rate is reduced, by requiring a minimum fraction of SLC hits\nin the trigger window. The FPT significantly improves the trigger efficiency by\na factor of 1.55, compared to standard triggers, while increasing the event\nrate in IceCube by a factor 1.004. The trigger algorithm was tested and\nsuccessfully deployed at South Pole in November 2023.",

Matrix-product state (MPS)-based methods can describe 1D\nsystems quasiexactly, but often struggle to retain sufficient bipartite\nentanglement to accurately approximate 2D systems already. Conversely, Quantum\nMonte Carlo (QMC) approaches, based on sampling a probability distribution, can\ngenerally approximate 2D and 3D systems with an error that decays\nsystematically with growing sampling size. However, QMC can suffer from the\nso-called sign problem, that makes the approach prohibitively costly for many\nsystems of interest, such as repulsively interacting fermions away from\ncommensurate densities and frustrated systems. In this article, we introduce a\nnew hybrid approach, that combines auxiliary-field QMC (AFQMC) with MPS-based\nalgorithms. This hybrid technique removes or reduces the sign problem\n(depending on the specific model) while also needing to retain much lower\nbipartite entanglement than brute-force application of a MPS-algorithm, without\nthe use of uncontrolled approximations.

It seems natural to consider the space of $G$-invariant CR\nsections in the high tensor powers as quantization space, on which a certain\nweighted $G$-invariant Fourier-Szeg\\H{o} operator projects. Under certain\nnatural assumptions, we show that the group invariant Fourier-Szeg\\H{o}\nprojector admits a full asymptotic expansion.

This study aims to decode dairy cow contact calls\nby employing multi-modal data fusion techniques, integrating transcription,\nsemantic analysis, contextual and emotional assessment, and acoustic feature\nextraction. We utilized the Natural Language Processing model to transcribe\naudio recordings of cow vocalizations into written form. By fusing multiple\nacoustic features frequency, duration, and intensity with transcribed textual\ndata, we developed a comprehensive representation of cow vocalizations.\nUtilizing data fusion within a custom-developed ontology, we categorized\nvocalizations into high frequency calls associated with distress or arousal,\nand low frequency calls linked to contentment or calmness. Analyzing the fused\nmulti dimensional data, we identified anxiety related features indicative of\nemotional distress, including specific frequency measurements and sound\nspectrum results. Assessing the sentiment and acoustic features of\nvocalizations from 20 individual cows allowed us to determine differences in\ncalling patterns and emotional states. Employing advanced machine learning\nalgorithms, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Recurrent Neural\nNetworks, we effectively processed and fused multi-source data to classify cow\nvocalizations. These models were optimized to handle computational demands and\ndata quality challenges inherent in practical farm environments. Our findings\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of multi-source data fusion and intelligent\nprocessing techniques in animal welfare monitoring. This study represents a\nsignificant advancement in animal welfare assessment, highlighting the role of\ninnovative fusion technologies in understanding and improving the emotional\nwellbeing of dairy cows.",

In general, driving logs consist\nof suddenly appearing obstacles or swiftly changing traffic signals, which\ntypically necessitate swift and nuanced adjustments in driving maneuvers.\nConcurrently, future trajectories of the vehicles exhibit their long-term\ndecisions, such as adhering to a reference lane or circumventing stationary\nobstacles. Due to the unpredictable influence of future events in driving logs,\nreasoning bias could be naturally introduced to learning based planning\nmodules, which leads to a possible degradation of driving performance. To\naddress this issue, we identify the decisions and their corresponding time\nhorizons, and characterize a so-called decision scope by retaining decisions\nwithin derivable horizons only, to mitigate the effect of irrational behaviors\ncaused by unpredictable events. Several viable implementations have been\nproposed, among which batch normalization along the temporal dimension is\nparticularly effective and achieves superior performance.

Moreover,\noptical networks demand rigorous stability, where direct deployment of\nstrategies generated from LLM poses safety concerns. In this paper, a digital\ntwin (DT)-enhanced LLM scheme is proposed to facilitate autonomous optical\nnetworks.

Prior to\ndeployment, the generated strategies from LLM can be pre-verified in the DT\nplatform, which also provides feedback to the LLM for further refinement of\nstrategies. The synergistic interplay between DT and LLM for autonomous optical\nnetworks is demonstrated through three scenarios: performance optimization\nunder dynamic loadings in an experimental C+L-band long-haul transmission link,\nprotection switching for device upgrading in a field-deployed six-node mesh\nnetwork, and performance recovery after fiber cuts in a field-deployed C+L-band\ntransmission link.",

Based on the aforementioned\nmeasure, TRACER can regulate the loss associated with corrupted data to reduce\nits influence, thereby enhancing robustness and performance in clean\nenvironments.

    "abstract": "Achieving robust 3D perception in the face of corrupted data presents an\nchallenging hurdle within 3D vision research. Contemporary transformer-based\npoint cloud recognition models, albeit advanced, tend to overfit to specific\npatterns, consequently undermining their robustness against corruption. In this\nwork, we introduce the Target-Guided Adversarial Point Cloud Transformer,\ntermed APCT, a novel architecture designed to augment global structure capture\nthrough an adversarial feature erasing mechanism predicated on patterns\ndiscerned at each step during training. Specifically, APCT integrates an\nAdversarial Significance Identifier and a Target-guided Promptor. The\nAdversarial Significance Identifier, is tasked with discerning token\nsignificance by integrating global contextual analysis, utilizing a structural\nsalience index algorithm alongside an auxiliary supervisory mechanism. The\nTarget-guided Promptor, is responsible for accentuating the propensity for\ntoken discard within the self-attention mechanism, utilizing the value derived\nabove, consequently directing the model attention towards alternative segments\nin subsequent stages. By iteratively applying this strategy in multiple steps\nduring training, the network progressively identifies and integrates an\nexpanded array of object-associated patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple corruption\nbenchmarks.",

However, existing research on the\ncauses of emotions typically employs an utterance selection method within a\nsingle textual modality to locate causal utterances. This approach remains\nlimited to coarse-grained assessments, lacks nuanced explanations of emotional\ncausation, and demonstrates inadequate capability in identifying multimodal\nemotional triggers. Therefore, we introduce a task-\\textbf{Multimodal Emotion\nCause Explanation in Conversation (MECEC)}. This task aims to generate a\nsummary based on the multimodal context of conversations, clearly and\nintuitively describing the reasons that trigger a given emotion. To adapt to\nthis task, we develop a new dataset (ECEM) based on the MELD dataset. ECEM\ncombines video clips with detailed explanations of character emotions, helping\nto explore the causal factors behind emotional expression in multimodal\nconversations. A novel approach, FAME-Net, is further proposed, that harnesses\nthe power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze visual data and accurately\ninterpret the emotions conveyed through facial expressions in videos. By\nexploiting the contagion effect of facial emotions, FAME-Net effectively\ncaptures the emotional causes of individuals engaged in conversations.

Recent attack methods leverage\nLLMs' instruction-following abilities and their inabilities to distinguish\ninstructions injected in the data content, and achieve a high attack success\nrate (ASR).

We clarify\nthe roots of the radial potential and obtain the parameter space of the\nazimuthal angular momentum and the Carter constant of the light rays for\nvarieties of the orbits. It is known that one of the unique features of\nextremal black holes for the null geodesics is the existence of the stable\ndouble root at the horizon, giving rise to the stable spherical motion. For the\nblack hole's spin $a<M/2$, the stable double root is isolated from the unstable\none. However, for $ a\\ge M/2$, the unstable and stable double roots merge at\nthe triple root so that the unstable double root in some parameter region can\nlie at the horizon, giving a very different shape to the light ring. We then\nfind the analytical expressions of light orbits, which can reach spatial\ninfinity for both nonequatorial and equatorial motions. In particular, for the\norbits starting from the near horizon of the extremal Kerr-Newman black holes\nwith the parameters for the unstable double and triple roots, the solutions are\nremarkably simple in terms of elementary functions. It is also found that the\nanalytical solutions of the equatorial motion can shed light on the deflection\nof the light by black holes. Varying the azimuthal angular momentum, as either\nthe double or triple root at the horizon is approached from the turning point,\nthe stronger power-law divergence in the deflection angle is found in\ncomparison with the typical logarithmic divergence in nonextremal black holes\nin the strong deflection limit.

    "abstract": "Few-Shot Cross-Domain NER is the process of leveraging knowledge from\ndata-rich source domains to perform entity recognition on data scarce target\ndomains. Most previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches use pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLMs) for cross-domain NER. However, these models are often\ndomain specific. To successfully use these models for new target domains, we\nneed to modify either the model architecture or perform model finetuning using\ndata from the new domains. Both of these result in the creation of entirely new\nNER models for each target domain which is infeasible for practical scenarios.\nRecently,several works have attempted to use LLMs to solve Few-Shot\nCross-Domain NER. However, most of these are either too expensive for practical\npurposes or struggle to follow LLM prompt instructions. In this paper, we\npropose IF-WRANER (Instruction Finetuned Word-embedding based Retrieval\nAugmented large language model for Named Entity Recognition), a retrieval\naugmented LLM, finetuned for the NER task. By virtue of the regularization\ntechniques used during LLM finetuning and the adoption of word-level embedding\nover sentence-level embedding during the retrieval of in-prompt examples,\nIF-WRANER is able to outperform previous SOTA Few-Shot Cross-Domain NER\napproaches. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model by benchmarking\nits performance on the open source CrossNER dataset, on which it shows more\nthan 2% F1 score improvement over the previous SOTA model. We have deployed the\nmodel for multiple customer care domains of an enterprise. Accurate entity\nprediction through IF-WRANER helps direct customers to automated workflows for\nthe domains, thereby reducing escalations to human agents by almost 15% and\nleading to millions of dollars in yearly savings for the company.",

The Co-Association matrix (CA matrix)\nbased method is the mainstream ensemble clustering approach that constructs the\nsimilarity relationships between sample pairs according the weak clustering\npartitions to generate the final clustering result. However, the existing\nmethods neglect that the quality of cluster is related to its size, i.e., a\ncluster with smaller size tends to higher accuracy.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we reveal a new characterization of the super-efficiency model\nfor Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). In DEA, the efficiency of each decision\nmaking unit (DMU) is measured by the ratio the weighted sum of outputs divided\nby the weighted sum of inputs. In order to measure efficiency of a DMU, ${\\rm\nDMU}_j$, say, in CCR model, the weights of inputs and outputs are determined so\nthat the effiency of ${\\rm DMU}_j$ is maximized under the constraint that the\nefficiency of each DMU is less than or equal to one. ${\\rm DMU}_j$ is called\nCCR-efficient if its efficiency score is equal to one. It often happens that\nweights making ${\\rm DMU}_j$ CCR-efficient are not unique but form continuous\nset. This can be problematic because the weights representing CCR-efficiencty\nof ${\\rm DMU}_j$ play an important role in making decisions on its management\nstrategy. In order to resolve this problem, we propose to choose weights which\nminimize the efficency of the second best DMU enhancing the strength of ${\\rm\nDMU}_j$, and demonstrate that this problem is reduced to a linear programming\nproblem identical to the renowned super-efficiency model. We conduct numerical\nexperiments using data of Japanese commercial banks to demonstrate the\nadvantage of the supper-efficiency model.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on incremental learning for image classification,\nexploring how to reduce catastrophic forgetting of all learned knowledge when\naccess to old data is restricted due to memory or privacy constraints. The\nchallenge of incremental learning lies in achieving an optimal balance between\nplasticity, the ability to learn new knowledge, and stability, the ability to\nretain old knowledge. Based on whether the task identifier (task-ID) of an\nimage can be obtained during the test stage, incremental learning for image\nclassifcation is divided into two main paradigms, which are task incremental\nlearning (TIL) and class incremental learning (CIL). The TIL paradigm has\naccess to the task-ID, allowing it to use multiple task-specific classification\nheads selected based on the task-ID. Consequently, in CIL, where the task-ID is\nunavailable, TIL methods must predict the task-ID to extend their application\nto the CIL paradigm. Our previous method for TIL adds task-specific batch\nnormalization and classification heads incrementally. This work extends the\nmethod by predicting task-ID through an \"unknown\" class added to each\nclassification head. The head with the lowest \"unknown\" probability is\nselected, enabling task-ID prediction and making the method applicable to CIL.\nThe task-specific batch normalization (BN) modules effectively adjust the\ndistribution of output feature maps across different tasks, enhancing the\nmodel's plasticity.Moreover, since BN has much fewer parameters compared to\nconvolutional kernels, by only modifying the BN layers as new tasks arrive, the\nmodel can effectively manage parameter growth while ensuring stability across\ntasks. The innovation of this study lies in the first-time introduction of\ntask-specific BN into CIL and verifying the feasibility of extending TIL\nmethods to CIL through task-ID prediction with state-of-the-art performance on\nmultiple datasets.",

Additionally, we analyze which modifications have the greatest\nimpact on model performance and explore how training on synthetic datasets can\nimprove robustness in real-world adverse scenarios. Our results demonstrate\nthat all tested models, particularly CNN-based architectures, experienced\nsignificant performance degradation under extreme conditions, while\nTransformer-based models exhibited greater resilience. We verify that models\ntrained on Cityscape-Adverse show significantly enhanced resilience when\napplied to unseen domains.

    "abstract": "It is well known that locally defined marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS)\nis null and coincident with the event horizon of an unperturbed static\nSchwarzschild black hole. This is however not true for an accreting black hole\nfor which MOTS separates out and turns spacelike. In this letter, we obtain the\nnecessary and sufficient condition for MOTS to remain null and coincident with\nthe event horizon even when matter is continuously accreting on. This also has\nan important bearing on the quantum Hawking radiation which is supposed to\nemanate from the MOTS, and it cannot propagate out to infinity unless MOTS is\nnull. The condition is, infalling timelike Type I fluid should turn null or\nType II, as it falls on the horizon. This transition from timelike to null is\ncaused by the tidal deformation of the infalling fluid, and that produces an\noutward directed heat flux giving rise to Vaidya radiation emanating out of the\nboundary of accreting zone. We thus predict a remarkable new phenomena that\naccreting black hole radiates classical Vaidya radiation that paves the way for\nthe Hawking radiation.",

However, existing protocols either face severe scalability issues\ndue to high on-chain and off-chain costs, or suffer from trust concerns because\nof centralized designs.\n  In this paper, we propose \\texttt{MAP}, a trustless blockchain\ninteroperability protocol that relays cross-chain transactions across\nheterogeneous chains with high scalability. First, within \\texttt{MAP}, we\ndevelop a novel \\textit{cross-chain relay} technique, which integrates a\nunified relay chain architecture and on-chain light clients of different source\nchains, allowing the retrieval and verification of diverse cross-chain\ntransactions. Furthermore, we reduce cross-chain verification costs by\nincorporating an optimized zk-based light client scheme that adaptively\ndecouples signature verification overheads from inefficient smart contract\nexecution and offloads them to off-chain provers. For experiments, we conducted\nthe first large-scale evaluation on existing interoperability protocols. With\n\\texttt{MAP}, the required number of on-chain light clients is reduced from\n$O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$, with around 35\\% reduction in on-chain costs and 25\\%\nreduction for off-chain costs when verifying cross-chain transactions.\n  To demonstrate the effectiveness, we deployed \\texttt{MAP} in the real world.\nBy 2024, we have supported over six popular public chains, 50 cross-chain\napplications and relayed over 200K cross-chain transactions worth over 640\nmillion USD.

The proposed method, using quaternions to\ndescribe the attitude of the controlled UAV, interchanges the stability\nproperties of the two fixed points-one locally asymptotically stable and\nanother unstable-of the resulting closed-loop (CL) switching dynamics of the\nsystem. In this approach, the switching events are triggered by the value of a\ncompound energy-based function. To analyze and ensure the stability of the CL\nswitching dynamics, we use classical nonlinear Lyapunov techniques, in\ncombination with switching-systems theory. For this purpose, we introduce a new\ncompound Lyapunov function (LF) that not only enables us to derive the\nconditions for CL asymptotic and exponential stability, but also provides us\nwith an estimate of the CL system's region of attraction. This new estimate is\nconsiderably larger than those previously reported for systems of the type\nconsidered in this paper. To test and demonstrate the functionality,\nsuitability, and performance of the proposed method, we present and discuss\nexperimental data obtained using a 31-g quadrotor during the execution of\nhigh-speed yaw-tracking maneuvers. Also, we provide empirical evidence\nindicating that all the initial conditions chosen for these maneuvers, as\nestimated, lie inside the system's region of attraction. Last, experimental\ndata obtained through these flight tests show that the proposed switching\ncontroller reduces the control effort by about 53%, on average, with respect to\nthat corresponding to a commonly used benchmark control scheme, when executing\na particular type of high-speed yaw-tracking maneuvers.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) provide remarkable zero-shot\nclassification capability covering a wide variety of object classes. However,\npractical applications do not always require the classification of all kinds of\nobjects, and leaving the model capable of recognizing unnecessary classes not\nonly degrades overall accuracy but also leads to operational disadvantages. To\nmitigate this issue, we explore the selective forgetting problem for PTMs,\nwhere the task is to make the model unable to recognize only the specified\nclasses while maintaining accuracy for the rest. All the existing methods\nassume \"white-box\" settings, where model information such as architectures,\nparameters, and gradients is available for training. However, PTMs are often\n\"black-box,\" where information on such models is unavailable for commercial\nreasons or social responsibilities. In this paper, we address a novel problem\nof selective forgetting for black-box models, named Black-Box Forgetting, and\npropose an approach to the problem. Given that information on the model is\nunavailable, we optimize the input prompt to decrease the accuracy of specified\nclasses through derivative-free optimization. To avoid difficult\nhigh-dimensional optimization while ensuring high forgetting performance, we\npropose Latent Context Sharing, which introduces common low-dimensional latent\ncomponents among multiple tokens for the prompt.

Unfortunately, existing work either over-modify NNs for IDP, or\ninsert inline pipelined accelerators into the data-plane, failing to meet the\nflexibility and unawareness goals.\n  In this paper, we propose Kaleidoscope, a flexible and high-performance\nco-processor located at the bypass of the data-plane. To address the challenge\nof meeting three design goals, three key techniques are presented. The\nprogrammable run-to-completion accelerators are developed for flexible\ninference. To further improve performance, we design a scalable inference\nengine which completes low-latency and low-cost inference for the mouse flows,\nand perform complex NNs with high-accuracy for the elephant flows. Finally,\nraw-bytes-based NNs are introduced, which help to achieve unawareness. We\nprototype Kaleidoscope on both FPGA and ASIC library.

To this\nend, we introduce StyleTex, an innovative diffusion-model-based framework for\ncreating stylized textures for 3D models. Our key insight is to decouple style\ninformation from the reference image while disregarding content in\ndiffusion-based distillation sampling. Specifically, given a reference image,\nwe first decompose its style feature from the image CLIP embedding by\nsubtracting the embedding's orthogonal projection in the direction of the\ncontent feature, which is represented by a text CLIP embedding. Our novel\napproach to disentangling the reference image's style and content information\nallows us to generate distinct style and content features. We then inject the\nstyle feature into the cross-attention mechanism to incorporate it into the\ngeneration process, while utilizing the content feature as a negative prompt to\nfurther dissociate content information. Finally, we incorporate these\nstrategies into StyleTex to obtain stylized textures. The resulting textures\ngenerated by StyleTex retain the style of the reference image, while also\naligning with the text prompts and intrinsic details of the given 3D mesh.\nQuantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms\nexisting baseline methods by a significant margin.",

When dimensional collapse occurs on features\n(e.g. hidden features and representations), it prevents features from\nrepresenting the full information of the data; when dimensional collapse occurs\non weight matrices, their filters are self-related and redundant, limiting\ntheir expressive power. Existing studies have predominantly concentrated on the\ndimensional collapse of representations, neglecting whether this can\nsufficiently prevent the dimensional collapse of the weight matrices and hidden\nfeatures.

The\nlatter dependency is obtained with a 2-body scale fixed to an unnaturally large\nvalue and a floating 3-body parameter. Specifically, we calculate the binding\nenergies of the shallow 3- and 4-body states, dimer-dimer and trimer-atom\nscattering lengths, and the trimer-atom to dimer-dimer reaction rates.\nEmploying a potential renormalized by a large 2-body scattering length and a\n3-body scale, we find all calculated observables to remain practically constant\nover the range $6\\textrm{fm}^{-2}<\\lambda<10\\textrm{fm}^{-2}$. Divergences in\nscattering lengths emerge for critical 3-body parameters at which thresholds\nare degenerate. Such threshold effects are found to be independent of the\nregulator cutoff.\n  Furthermore, at those critical points where the dimer-dimer and trimer-atom\nthresholds overlap, we predict an enhancement of the inelastic over the elastic\nscattering event.

    "abstract": "Multi-View Representation Learning (MVRL) aims to learn a unified\nrepresentation of an object from multi-view data. Deep Canonical Correlation\nAnalysis (DCCA) and its variants share simple formulations and demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance. However, with extensive experiments, we observe\nthe issue of model collapse, {\\em i.e.}, the performance of DCCA-based methods\nwill drop drastically when training proceeds. The model collapse issue could\nsignificantly hinder the wide adoption of DCCA-based methods because it is\nchallenging to decide when to early stop. To this end, we develop NR-DCCA,\nwhich is equipped with a novel noise regularization approach to prevent model\ncollapse. Theoretical analysis shows that the Correlation Invariant Property is\nthe key to preventing model collapse, and our noise regularization forces the\nneural network to possess such a property. A framework to construct synthetic\ndata with different common and complementary information is also developed to\ncompare MVRL methods comprehensively. The developed NR-DCCA outperforms\nbaselines stably and consistently in both synthetic and real-world datasets,\nand the proposed noise regularization approach can also be generalized to other\nDCCA-based methods such as DGCCA.",

    "abstract": "In numerous artificial intelligence applications, the collaborative efforts\nof multiple intelligent agents are imperative for the successful attainment of\ntarget objectives. To enhance coordination among these agents, a distributed\ncommunication framework is often employed. However, indiscriminate information\nsharing among all agents can be resource-intensive, and the adoption of\nmanually pre-defined communication architectures imposes constraints on\ninter-agent communication, thus limiting the potential for effective\ncollaboration. Moreover, the communication framework often remains static\nduring inference, which may result in sustained high resource consumption, as\nin most cases, only key decisions necessitate information sharing among agents.\nIn this study, we introduce a novel approach wherein we conceptualize the\ncommunication architecture among agents as a learnable graph. We formulate this\nproblem as the task of determining the communication graph while enabling the\narchitecture parameters to update normally, thus necessitating a bi-level\noptimization process. Utilizing continuous relaxation of the graph\nrepresentation and incorporating attention units, our proposed approach,\nCommFormer, efficiently optimizes the communication graph and concurrently\nrefines architectural parameters through gradient descent in an end-to-end\nmanner. Additionally, we introduce a temporal gating mechanism for each agent,\nenabling dynamic decisions on whether to receive shared information at a given\ntime, based on current observations, thus improving decision-making efficiency.\nExtensive experiments on a variety of cooperative tasks substantiate the\nrobustness of our model across diverse cooperative scenarios, where agents are\nable to develop more coordinated and sophisticated strategies regardless of\nchanges in the number of agents.",

One of the\nmajor challenges of such growths is the large-scale thickness variation of the\ngrown film. To investigate the role of different growth parameters\ncomputationally, we use a 2D asymmetric simple-exclusion process (ASEP) model\nwith open boundaries as an approximation to the dynamics of deposition on the\ncoarse-grained lattice. The variations in concentration of particles (growth\nprofiles) at the lattice sites in the grown film are studied as functions of\nparameters like injection and ejection rate of particles from the lattice, time\nof observation, and the right bias (difference between the hopping\nprobabilities towards right and towards left) imposed by the carrier gas. In\naddition, the deposition rates at a given coarse-grained site is assumed to\ndepend on the occupancy of that site. The effect of the maximum deposition\nrate, i.e., the deposition rate at a completely unoccupied site on the\nsubstrate, has been explored. The growth profiles stretch horizontally when\neither the evolution time or the right bias is increased. An increased\ndeposition rate leads to a step-like profile, with the higher density region\nclose to the left edge. In 3D, the growth profiles become more uniform with the\nincrease in the height of the precursor with respect to the substrate surface.\nThese results qualitatively agree with the experimental observations.",

Although memorization is\nwidely believed to have a close relationship with the strong generalizability\nof deep learning when using over-parameterized models, to the best of our\nknowledge, there exists no theoretical study on the generalizability of\nmemorization neural networks. In this paper, we give the first theoretical\nanalysis of this topic. Since using i.i.d. training data is a necessary\ncondition for a learning algorithm to be generalizable, memorization and its\ngeneralization theory for i.i.d. datasets are developed under mild conditions\non the data distribution. First, algorithms are given to construct memorization\nnetworks for an i.i.d. dataset, which have the smallest number of parameters\nand even a constant number of parameters. Second, we show that, in order for\nthe memorization networks to be generalizable, the width of the network must be\nat least equal to the dimension of the data, which implies that the existing\nmemorization networks with an optimal number of parameters are not\ngeneralizable. Third, a lower bound for the sample complexity of general\nmemorization algorithms and the exact sample complexity for memorization\nalgorithms with constant number of parameters are given. It is also shown that\nthere exist data distributions such that, to be generalizable for them, the\nmemorization network must have an exponential number of parameters in the data\ndimension.

In this work, we\nintroduce DIPPER, a novel HRL framework that formulates hierarchical policy\nlearning as a bi-level optimization problem and leverages direct preference\noptimization (DPO) to train the higher-level policy using preference feedback.\nBy optimizing the higher-level policy with DPO, we decouple higher-level\nlearning from the non-stationary lower-level reward signal, thus mitigating\nnon-stationarity. To further address the infeasible subgoal problem, DIPPER\nincorporates a regularization that tries to ensure the feasibility of subgoal\ntasks within the capabilities of the lower-level policy. Extensive experiments\non challenging robotic navigation and manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that\nDIPPER achieves up to 40\\% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in\nsparse reward scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness in overcoming\nlongstanding limitations of HRL.",

Recently, for\nvisual-language models (VLMs), the focus of targeted adversarial attacks is to\ngenerate a perturbation that makes VLMs answer intended target text outputs.\nFor example, they aim to make a small perturbation on an image to make VLMs'\nanswers change from \"there is an apple\" to \"there is a baseball.\" However,\nanswering just intended text outputs is insufficient for tricky questions like\n\"if there is a baseball, tell me what is below it.\" This is because the target\nof the adversarial attacks does not consider the overall integrity of the\noriginal image, thereby leading to a lack of visual reasoning. In this work, we\nfocus on generating targeted adversarial examples with visual reasoning against\nVLMs. To this end, we propose 1) a novel adversarial attack procedure --\nnamely, Replace-then-Perturb and 2) a contrastive learning-based adversarial\nloss -- namely, Contrastive-Adv. In Replace-then-Perturb, we first leverage a\ntext-guided segmentation model to find the target object in the image. Then, we\nget rid of the target object and inpaint the empty space with the desired\nprompt. By doing this, we can generate a target image corresponding to the\ndesired prompt, while maintaining the overall integrity of the original image.\nFurthermore, in Contrastive-Adv, we design a novel loss function to obtain\nbetter adversarial examples.

To address these challenges, we propose a learning-based\nModified Second-Bid (MSB) auction mechanism to optimize resource allocation\nbetween ground BSs and UAVs by accounting for VT task latency and accuracy.\nMoreover, we design a diffusion-based reinforcement learning algorithm to\noptimize the price scaling factor, maximizing the total surplus of resource\nproviders and minimizing VT task latency. Finally, simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed diffusion-based MSB auction outperforms\ntraditional baselines, providing better resource distribution and enhanced\nservice quality for vehicular users.",

We explore the OAM texture within edge\nstates and unveil the OAM accumulation at the edges using several lattice\nmodels based on the $s$ orbital. By comparing slabs with differently shaped\nedges, we not only clarify the role of electron wiggling motion in shaping OAM\ntexture but also highlight the absence of bulk-boundary correspondence in the\naccumulation process. The topological insulator and higher-order topological\ninsulator models further confirm these findings and provide evidence for the\nrelationship between the higher-order topology and the OEE.

    "abstract": "A Blockchain Name System (BNS) simplifies the process of sending\ncryptocurrencies by replacing complex cryptographic recipient addresses with\nhuman-readable names, making the transactions more convenient. Unfortunately,\nthese names can be susceptible to typosquatting attacks, where attackers can\ntake advantage of user typos by registering typographically similar BNS names.\nUnsuspecting users may accidentally mistype or misinterpret the intended name,\nresulting in an irreversible transfer of funds to an attacker's address instead\nof the intended recipient. In this work, we present the first large-scale,\nintra-BNS typosquatting study. To understand the prevalence of typosquatting\nwithin BNSs, we study three different services (Ethereum Name Service,\nUnstoppable Domains, and ADAHandles) spanning three blockchains (Ethereum,\nPolygon, and Cardano), collecting a total of 4.9M BNS names and 200M\ntransactions-the largest dataset for BNSs to date. We describe the challenges\ninvolved in conducting name-squatting studies on these alternative naming\nsystems, and then perform an in-depth quantitative analysis of our dataset. We\nfind that typosquatters are indeed active on BNSs, registering more malicious\ndomains with each passing year. Our analysis reveals that users have sent\nthousands of transactions to squatters and that squatters target both globally\npopular BNS domain names as well as the domains owned by popular Twitter/X\nusers. Lastly, we document the complete lack of defenses against typosquatting\nin custodial and non-custodial wallets and propose straightforward\ncountermeasures that can protect users without relying on third-party services.",

The PD in the NB is observed to be\nweaker than in the horizontal branch (HB) but aligned in the same direction.\nThe PD of the source exhibits a marginal increase with energy while the PA\nshows no energy dependence. The joint spectro-polarimetric modeling is\nconsistent with the observed X-ray polarization originating from a single\nspectral component from the blackbody or the Comptonized emission while the\ndisk emission does not contribute towards the X-ray polarization.

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity due to their transparency, security,\nand accessibility compared to traditional financial systems, with Bitcoin,\nintroduced in 2009, leading the market. Bitcoin's security relies on blockchain\ntechnology - a decentralized ledger consisting of a consensus and an incentive\nmechanism. The consensus mechanism, Proof of Work (PoW), requires miners to\nsolve difficult cryptographic puzzles to add new blocks, while the incentive\nmechanism rewards them with newly minted bitcoins. However, as Bitcoin's\nacceptance grows, it faces increasing threats from attacks targeting these\nmechanisms, such as selfish mining, double-spending, and block withholding.\nThese attacks compromise security, efficiency, and reward distribution. Recent\nresearch shows that these attacks can be combined with each other or with\neither malicious strategies, such as network-layer attacks, or non-malicious\nstrategies, like honest mining. These combinations lead to more sophisticated\nattacks, increasing the attacker's success rates and profitability. Therefore,\nunderstanding and evaluating these attacks is essential for developing\neffective countermeasures and ensuring long-term security. This paper begins by\nexamining individual attacks executed in isolation and their profitability. It\nthen explores how combining these attacks with each other or with other\nmalicious and non-malicious strategies can enhance their overall effectiveness\nand profitability. The analysis further explores how the deployment of attacks\nsuch as selfish mining and block withholding by multiple competing mining pools\nagainst each other impacts their economic returns.

    "abstract": "The upper confidence bound (UCB) policy is recognized as an order-optimal\nsolution for the classical total-reward bandit problem. While similar UCB-based\napproaches have been applied to the max bandit problem, which aims to maximize\nthe cumulative maximal reward, their order optimality remains unclear. In this\nstudy, we clarify the unified conditions under which the UCB policy achieves\nthe order optimality in both total-reward and max bandit problems. A key\nconcept of our theory is the oracle quantity, which identifies the best arm by\nits highest value. This allows a unified definition of the UCB policy as\npulling the arm with the highest UCB of the oracle quantity. Additionally,\nunder this setting, optimality analysis can be conducted by replacing\ntraditional regret with the number of failures as a core measure. One\nconsequence of our analysis is that the confidence interval of the oracle\nquantity must narrow appropriately as trials increase to ensure the order\noptimality of UCB policies. From this consequence, we prove that the previously\nproposed MaxSearch algorithm satisfies this condition and is an order-optimal\npolicy for the max bandit problem. We also demonstrate that new bandit problems\nand their order-optimal UCB algorithms can be systematically derived by\nproviding the appropriate oracle quantity and its confidence interval. Building\non this, we propose PIUCB algorithms, which aim to pull the arm with the\nhighest probability of improvement (PI). These algorithms can be applied to the\nmax bandit problem in practice and perform comparably or better than the\nMaxSearch algorithm in toy examples. This suggests that our theory has the\npotential to generate new policies tailored to specific oracle quantities.",

It circumvents the need for costly and\ntime-consuming medical imaging data collection, preparation, and processing.\nCurrent SR methods leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) thanks to their\nability to natively handle graph-structured datasets. However, most GNNs\nperform node feature learning, which presents two significant limitations: (1)\nthey require computationally expensive methods to learn complex node features\ncapable of inferring connectivity strength or edge features, which do not scale\nto larger graphs; and (2) computations in the node space fail to adequately\ncapture higher-order brain topologies such as cliques and hubs. However,\nnumerous studies have shown that brain graph topology is crucial in identifying\nthe onset and presence of various neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer\nand Parkinson. Motivated by these challenges and applications, we propose our\nSTP-GSR framework. It is the first graph SR architecture to perform\nrepresentation learning in higher-order topological space. Specifically, using\nthe primal-dual graph formulation from graph theory, we develop an efficient\nmapping from the edge space of our low-resolution (LR) brain graphs to the node\nspace of a high-resolution (HR) dual graph. This approach ensures that\nnode-level computations on this dual graph correspond naturally to edge-level\nlearning on our HR brain graphs, thereby enforcing strong topological\nconsistency within our framework. Additionally, our framework is GNN layer\nagnostic and can easily learn from smaller, scalable GNNs, reducing\ncomputational requirements.

In addition,\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology is incorporated in RIS-aided\nISCPT systems to boost the spectrum utilization efficiency of RIS-aided ISCPT\nsystems. We consider the power minimization problem of the RIS-aided ISCPT-NOMA\nsystem.

Since the objective function and constraints in\nthe optimization problem are non-convex, the problem is an NP-hard problem. To\nsolve the non-convex problem, this paper proposes a block coordinate descent\n(BCD) algorithm. Specifically, the non-convex problem is divided into four\nsub-problems: i.e. the transmit beamforming, RIS phase shift, decoding order\nand PS factor optimization subproblems. We employ semidefinite relaxation (SDR)\nand successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to address the transmit\nbeamforming optimization sub-problem.

Using this multidimensional evaluation framework, along with\ntraditional aspects, we evaluate the performance of seven LLM-based\nrecommenders, with three prompting strategies, comparing them with six\ntraditional models on both ranking and re-ranking tasks on four datasets. We\nfind that LLMs excel at handling tasks with prior knowledge and shorter input\nhistories in the ranking setting, and perform better in the re-ranking setting,\nbeating traditional models across multiple dimensions. However, LLMs exhibit\nsubstantial candidate position bias issues, and some models hallucinate\nnon-existent items much more often than others. We intend our evaluation\nframework and observations to benefit future research on the use of LLMs as\nrecommenders.

    "abstract": "Cloth-changing person re-identification is a subject closer to the real\nworld, which focuses on solving the problem of person re-identification after\npedestrians change clothes. The primary challenge in this field is to overcome\nthe complex interplay between intra-class and inter-class variations and to\nidentify features that remain unaffected by changes in appearance. Sufficient\ndata collection for model training would significantly aid in addressing this\nproblem. However, it is challenging to gather diverse datasets in practice.\nCurrent methods focus on implicitly learning identity information from the\noriginal image or introducing additional auxiliary models, which are largely\nlimited by the quality of the image and the performance of the additional\nmodel. To address these issues, inspired by prompt learning, we propose a novel\nmultiple information prompt learning (MIPL) scheme for cloth-changing person\nReID, which learns identity robust features through the common prompt guidance\nof multiple messages. Specifically, the clothing information stripping (CIS)\nmodule is designed to decouple the clothing information from the original RGB\nimage features to counteract the influence of clothing appearance. The\nBio-guided attention (BGA) module is proposed to increase the learning\nintensity of the model for key information. A dual-length hybrid patch (DHP)\nmodule is employed to make the features have diverse coverage to minimize the\nimpact of feature bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the LTCC, Celeb-reID,\nCeleb-reID-light, and CSCC datasets, achieving rank-1 scores of 74.8%, 73.3%,\n66.0%, and 88.1%, respectively. When compared to AIM (CVPR23), ACID (TIP23),\nand SCNet (MM23), MIPL achieves rank-1 improvements of 11.3%, 13.8%, and 7.9%,\nrespectively, on the PRCC dataset.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning framework that leverages\ncommonalities between distributed client datasets to train a global model.\nUnder heterogeneous clients, however, FL can fail to produce stable training\nresults. Personalized federated learning (PFL) seeks to address this by\nlearning individual models tailored to each client. One approach is to\ndecompose model training into shared representation learning and personalized\nclassifier training. Nonetheless, previous works struggle to navigate the\nbias-variance trade-off in classifier learning, relying solely on limited local\ndatasets or introducing costly techniques to improve generalization. In this\nwork, we frame representation learning as a generative modeling task, where\nrepresentations are trained with a classifier based on the global feature\ndistribution. We then propose an algorithm, pFedFDA, that efficiently generates\npersonalized models by adapting global generative classifiers to their local\nfeature distributions. Through extensive computer vision benchmarks, we\ndemonstrate that our method can adjust to complex distribution shifts with\nsignificant improvements over current state-of-the-art in data-scarce settings.",

We address these\nquestions in the following ways. (1) An upper bound for polarization is\nderived, and we propose what we call a neural polarization law: most\ninterpolating neural network models are 4/3-polarized. Our empirical results\nnot only support this conjecture but also show that polarization is nearly\nconstant for a dataset, regardless of hyperparameters or architectures of\nclassifiers. (2) The error of the majority vote classifier is considered under\nrestricted entropy conditions, and we present a tight upper bound that\nindicates that the disagreement is linearly correlated with the target, and\nthat the slope is linear in the polarization. (3) We prove results for the\nasymptotic behavior of the disagreement in terms of the number of classifiers,\nwhich we show can help in predicting the performance for a larger number of\nclassifiers from that of a smaller number.

QDNs utilize a quantum teleportation technique through\nlong-distance entanglement connections, encoding data information in quantum\nbits (qubits). Despite being a cornerstone in various quantum applications,\nquantum entanglement encounters challenges in establishing connections over\nextended distances due to probabilistic processes influenced by factors like\noptical fiber losses. The creation of long-distance entanglement connections\nbetween quantum computers involves multiple entanglement links and entanglement\nswapping techniques through successive quantum nodes, including quantum\ncomputers and quantum repeaters, necessitating optimal path selection and qubit\nallocation. Current research predominantly assumes known success rates of\nentanglement links between neighboring quantum nodes and overlooks potential\nnetwork attackers. This paper addresses the online challenge of optimal path\nselection and qubit allocation, aiming to learn the best strategy for achieving\nthe highest success rate of entanglement connections between two chosen quantum\ncomputers without prior knowledge of the success rate and in the presence of a\nQDN attacker. The proposed approach is based on multi-armed bandits,\nspecifically adversarial group neural bandits, which treat each path as a group\nand view qubit allocation as arm selection.

One potential solution to bypass such constraints might be the use of\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) in the context of FL. However, we have\nobserved that typical PEFT tends to severely suffer from heterogeneity among\nclients in FL scenarios, resulting in unstable and slow convergence. In this\npaper, we propose Client-Customized Adaptation (C2A), a novel\nhypernetwork-based FL framework that generates client-specific adapters by\nconditioning the client information. With the effectiveness of the\nhypernetworks in generating customized weights through learning to adopt the\ndifferent characteristics of inputs, C2A can maximize the utility of shared\nmodel parameters while minimizing the divergence caused by client\nheterogeneity. To verify the efficacy of C2A, we perform extensive evaluations\non FL scenarios involving heterogeneity in label and language distributions.\nComprehensive evaluation results clearly support the superiority of C2A in\nterms of both efficiency and effectiveness in FL scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Jogs, atomic-scale steps on dislocations, play an important role in crystal\nplasticity, yet they are often ignored in discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD)\nsimulations due to their small sizes. While jogs on screw dislocations are\nknown to move non-conservatively (i.e. climb) accompanied by vacancy emission,\njogs on edge dislocations are commonly expected to move conservatively (i.e.\nglide) with the dislocation under ambient conditions. Here we report unexpected\nfindings from molecular dynamics simulations of an edge dislocation containing\na pair of unit jogs in face-centered cubic nickel at 300K. While the jogs glide\nconservatively with the edge dislocation at low stresses, we observe that one\nof the jogs climbs and emits vacancies intermittently at higher stresses. This\nobservation is unexpected at such a low temperature, as climb is typically\nassociated with temperatures closer to the creep temperature (roughly half of\nthe melting temperature). Our results highlight the significance of the complex\ninterplay between point defects (i.e., vacancies) and dislocations in\nroom-temperature plasticity, suggesting that these interactions may be more\nsignificant than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "In recent times, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been trained under two\npredominant paradigms. Generative training has enabled Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs) to tackle various complex tasks, yet issues such as\nhallucinations and weak object discrimination persist. Discriminative training,\nexemplified by models like CLIP, excels in zero-shot image-text classification\nand retrieval, yet struggles with complex scenarios requiring fine-grained\nsemantic differentiation. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a\nunified approach that integrates the strengths of both paradigms. Considering\ninterleaved image-text sequences as the general format of input samples, we\nintroduce a structure-induced training strategy that imposes semantic\nrelationships between input samples and the MLLM's hidden state. This approach\nenhances the MLLM's ability to capture global semantics and distinguish\nfine-grained semantics. By leveraging dynamic sequence alignment within the\nDynamic Time Warping framework and integrating a novel kernel for fine-grained\nsemantic differentiation, our method effectively balances generative and\ndiscriminative tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple generative tasks,\nespecially those requiring cognitive and discrimination abilities.\nAdditionally, our method surpasses discriminative benchmarks in interleaved and\nfine-grained retrieval tasks. By employing a retrieval-augmented generation\nstrategy, our approach further enhances performance in some generative tasks\nwithin one model, offering a promising direction for future research in\nvision-language modeling.",

However, the conventional QPM relies on periodically poled\nferroelectric crystals, which are limited in availability. The 3R phase of\nmolybdenum disulfide (3R-MoS2), a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDc) with\nthe broken inversion symmetry, stands out as a promising candidate for QPM,\nenabling efficient nonlinear process. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the\nQPM at nanoscale, utilizing van der Waals stacking of 3R-MoS2 layers with\nspecific orientation to realize second harmonic generation (SHG) enhancement\nbeyond the non QPM limit. We have also demonstrated enhanced spontaneous\nparametric down-conversion (SPDC) via QPM of 3R-MoS2 homo-structure, enabling\nmore efficient generation of entangled photon pairs. The tunable capacity of\n3R-MoS2 van der Waals stacking provides a platform for tuning phase-matching\ncondition. This technique opens interesting possibilities for potential\napplications in nonlinear process and quantum technology.",

However, the nature of the plaquette-singlet phase in\nSrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ remains unresolved, and with it the identification of the\nDQCP symmetry from among several theoretical scenarios. Here we perform\ndetailed high-pressure $^{11}$B NMR studies to reveal the presence of both the\nfull-plaquette (FP) and empty-plaquette (EP) phases in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$,\nphase-separated at a first-order, pressure-driven transition with a\nvolume-fraction effect. The field-driven transition from the EP to the\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) phase complements our previous observations of the\nFP--AFM transition, with both showing deconfined quantum criticality, while the\nscaling of the spin-lattice relaxation rate near the EP--AFM transition, $1/T_1\n\\propto T^{0.6}$, suggests a DQCP governed by a different universality class.\nWe discuss possible extensions to the Shastry-Sutherland model that account for\nthese pressure and field effects. The expanded phase space we discover mandates\nan SO(5) DQCP symmetry, and hence our results take an important step towards a\ncomplete understanding of deconfined quantum criticality in\nSrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.",

Here, by studying the spin excitations\nof the $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic Shastry-Sutherland model, we show that the\nN\\'eel antiferromagnetic state in this model is an altermagnet featuring a\nnon-relativistic splitting between two chiral magnon bands. Moreover, we\nidentify a Higgs mode in the longitudinal excitation channel, whose gap softens\nwhen approaching the antiferromagnetic to plaquette valence bond solid\ntransition, implying the appearance of nearly deconfined excitations. However,\nthe splitting between the two magnon bands (Goldstone modes) remains finite at\nthe transition.

In this study, we\npresent RAG$^2$ (RAtionale-Guided RAG), a new framework for enhancing the\nreliability of RAG in biomedical contexts. RAG$^2$ incorporates three key\ninnovations: a small filtering model trained on perplexity-based labels of\nrationales, which selectively augments informative snippets of documents while\nfiltering out distractors; LLM-generated rationales as queries to improve the\nutility of retrieved snippets; a structure designed to retrieve snippets evenly\nfrom a comprehensive set of four biomedical corpora, effectively mitigating\nretriever bias. Our experiments demonstrate that RAG$^2$ improves the\nstate-of-the-art LLMs of varying sizes, with improvements of up to 6.1\\%, and\nit outperforms the previous best medical RAG model by up to 5.6\\% across three\nmedical question-answering benchmarks.

Our method uses a sampling-based\nflagging technique to find hallucinatory generations that should be removed. We\nfirst sample multiple reports at varying temperatures and then use a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to identify claims that are not consistently supported\nacross samples, indicating that the model has low confidence in those claims.\nUsing a calibrated threshold, we flag a fraction of these claims as likely\nhallucinations, which should undergo extra review or be automatically rejected.\nOur method achieves high precision when identifying both individual\nhallucinatory sentences and reports that contain hallucinations.

We assume a\ngeometrically thin, gas-pressure-dominated accretion disk, incorporating both\nmagnetic braking and turbulent viscosity introduced by an extended\nalpha-viscosity prescription. Additionally, the vertical stress parameter is\nassumed to scale with the disk aspect ratio. We confirm that the derived\nsolutions result in standard disk solutions when the wind is absent. We find\nthat the mass accretion rate decreases as the disk mass falls inward, while the\nmass loss rate increases with radius. The disk spectrum emitted from the\nmagnetically-driven disk wind can be observed without interference from the\nwind medium because the wind is significantly optically thin. The spectral\nluminosity is proportional to $\\nu^{1/3}$ in the intermediate,\nmulticolor-blackbody wavebands, in the absence of wind, as predicted by\nstandard disk theory. However, in the presence of wind, it follows a different\npower-law dependence on frequency over the same range. A deviation from the\nspectral slope of $1/3$, particularly a negative spectral slope, is a clear\nindicator of the presence of a magnetically driven wind.

We find that eRO-QPE2 1) is\nremarkably stable over the entire 3.5-year temporal baseline in its eruption\npeak luminosity, eruption temperature, quiescent temperature, and quiescent\nluminosity, 2) has a stable mean eruption recurrence time of 2.35 hours, with\nmarginal ($\\sim$2$\\sigma$) evidence for a $0.1$ hour reduction over the 3.5 yr\nperiod, and 3) has a long-short variation in its recurrence time in August\n2020, but this pattern is absent from all subsequent observations. The\nstability of its peak eruption luminosity and that of the quiescent state are\nnotably dissimilar from three previously tracked QPEs (GSN069, eRO-QPE1,\neRO-QPE3), which show declines in eruption and quiescent flux over comparable\ntemporal baselines.

The tabular features may even arise naturally if,\ne.g., one tries to build a graph such that some of the node or edge features\nare stored in a tabular format. Here we address the problem of explaining the\noutput of such ensemble models for which the input features consist of learned\nneural graph embeddings combined with additional tabular features. We propose\nMBExplainer, a model-agnostic explanation approach for downstream models with\naugmented graph embeddings. MBExplainer returns a human-legible triple as an\nexplanation for an instance prediction of the whole pipeline consisting of\nthree components: a subgraph with the highest importance, the topmost important\nnodal features, and the topmost important augmented downstream features. A\ngame-theoretic formulation is used to take the contributions of each component\nand their interactions into account by assigning three Shapley values\ncorresponding to their own specific games. Finding the explanation requires an\nefficient search through the corresponding local search spaces corresponding to\neach component. MBExplainer applies a novel multilevel search algorithm that\nenables simultaneous pruning of local search spaces in a computationally\ntractable way. In particular, three interweaved Monte Carlo Tree Search are\nutilized to iteratively prune the local search spaces.

However, its performance is degraded when data deviate from\nnormality. In this comprehensive simulation analysis, we show that BKMR's power\nand test size vary under different distributions and covariance matrix\nstructures. Our results demonstrate specifically that BKMR's robustness is\ninfluenced by the response's coefficient of variation (CV), resulting in\nreduced accuracy to detect true effects when data are skewed.

Since\nsuch a transition seems to be linked to a morphological transformation,\nstudying the morphological properties of these RedSFGs is essential to our\nunderstanding of galaxy evolution. To this end, we are using JWST/NIRCam images\nfrom the CEERS survey to assemble a mass-complete sample of 188 massive\ngalaxies at $z=3-4$, for which we perform resolved-SED fit. After classifying\ngalaxies into typical blue SFGs (BlueSFGs), RedSFGs and quiescent galaxies\n(QGs), we compare the morphologies of each population in terms of stellar mass\ndensity, SFR density, sSFR, dust-attenuation and mass-weighted age. We find\nthat RedSFGs and QGs present similar stellar surface density profiles and that\nRedSFGs manifest a dust attenuation concentration significantly higher than\nthat of BlueSFGs at all masses. This indicates that to become quiescent, a\nBlueSFG must transit through a major compaction phase once it has become\nsufficiently massive. At the same time, we find RedSFGs and QGs to account for\nmore than $50\\%$ of galaxies with ${\\rm log}(M_\\ast/M_\\odot)> 10.4$ at this\nredshift. This transition mass corresponds to the \"critical mass\" delineating\nthe bimodality between BlueSFGs and QGs in the local Universe. We then conclude\nthat there is a bimodality between extended BlueSFGs and compact, highly\nattenuated RedSFGs that have undergone a major gas compaction phase enabling\nthe latter to build a massive bulb in situ. There is evidence that this\nearly-stage separation is at the origin of the local bimodality between\nBlueSFGs and QGs, which we refer to as a \"primeval bimodality\".",

To\nachieve this, we reformulate time series modeling as approximating the series\nwith smooth univariate functions. The local smoothness of each univariate\nfunction ensures that the fitted time series remains resilient against local\ndisturbances.

We thus propose KAN-AD, replacing B-splines with truncated Fourier\nexpansions and introducing a novel lightweight learning mechanism that\nemphasizes global patterns while staying robust to local disturbances. On four\npopular TSAD benchmarks, KAN-AD achieves an average 15% improvement in\ndetection accuracy (with peaks exceeding 27%) over state-of-the-art baselines.\nRemarkably, it requires fewer than 1,000 trainable parameters, resulting in a\n50% faster inference speed compared to the original KAN, demonstrating the\napproach's efficiency and practical viability.",

The results show that disks with\nporous dust opacities yield similar dust temperature, but systematically lower\nmillimeter fluxes compared to disks incorporating compact dust grains.\nMoreover, we recalibrate the relation between dust temperature and stellar\nluminosity for a wide range of stellar parameters, and calculate the dust\nmasses of a large sample of disks using the traditionally analytic approach.\nThe median dust mass from our calculation is about 6 times higher than the\nliterature result, and this is mostly driven by the different opacities of\nporous and compact grains. A comparison of the cumulative distribution function\nbetween disk dust masses and exoplanet masses show that the median exoplanet\nmass is about 2 times lower than the median dust mass, if grains are porous,\nand there are no exoplanetary systems with masses higher than the most massive\ndisks.

Over the past decades, various feature-based\nout-of-distribution (OOD) approaches have been developed to address this issue,\nyet defining the decision boundary between known and unknown targets remains\nchallenging. Additionally, unlike optical images, detecting unknown targets in\nSAR imagery is further complicated by high speckle noise, the presence of\nclutter, and the inherent similarities in back-scattered microwave signals.

Given a fully connected Bayesian neural network with\nspike-and-slab priors trained via a variational algorithm, we obtain the\nposterior inclusion probability for every node that typically gets lost. We\nemploy these probabilities for pruning and feature selection on a host of\nsimulated and real-world benchmark data and find evidence of better\ngeneralizability of the pruned model in all our experiments.",

    "abstract": "We extend the shifted boundary method (SBM) to the simulation of\nincompressible fluid flow using immersed octree meshes. Previous work on SBM\nfor fluid flow primarily utilized two- or three-dimensional unstructured\ntetrahedral grids. Recently, octree grids have become an essential component of\nimmersed CFD solvers, and this work addresses this gap and the associated\ncomputational challenges. We leverage an optimal (approximate) surrogate\nboundary constructed efficiently on incomplete and adaptive octree meshes. The\nresulting framework enables the simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations in complex geometries without requiring boundary-fitted grids.\nSimulations of benchmark tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate that the\nOctree-SBM framework is a robust, accurate, and efficient approach to\nsimulating fluid dynamics problems with complex geometries.",

    "abstract": "We establish a characterization (under some natural conditions) of those\norders in Dedekind domains which allow a transfer homomorphism to a monoid of\nzero-sum sequences. As a consequence, the inclusion map to the Dedekind domain\nis a transfer homomorphism, with the exception of a particular case. The\narithmetic of Krull and Dedekind domains is well understood, and the existence\nof a transfer homomorphism implies that the order and the associated Dedekind\ndomain share the same arithmetic properties. This is not the case for arbitrary\norders in Dedekind domains.",

    "abstract": "Aiming at the problem that existing methods could not fully capture the\nintrinsic structure of data without considering the higher-order neighborhood\ninformation of the data, we proposed an unsupervised feature selection\nalgorithm based on graph filtering and self-representation. Firstly,a\nhigher-order graph filter was applied to the data to obtain its smooth\nrepresentation,and a regularizer was designed to combine the higher-order graph\ninformation for the self-representation matrix learning to capture the\nintrinsic structure of the data. Secondly,l2,1 norm was used to reconstruct the\nerror term and feature selection matrix to enhance the robustness and row\nsparsity of the model to select the discriminant features. Finally, an\niterative algorithm was applied to effectively solve the proposed objective\nfunction and simulation experiments were carried out to verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",
