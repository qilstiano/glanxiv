    "abstract": "Q&A websites rely on user-generated responses, with incentives such as\nreputation scores or monetary rewards often offered. While some users may find\nit intrinsically rewarding to assist others, studies indicate that payment can\nimprove the quality and speed of answers. However, traditional payment\nprocessors impose minimum thresholds that many Q&A inquiries fall below. The\nintroduction of Bitcoin enabled direct digital value transfer, yet frequent\nmicropayments remain challenging. Recent advancements like the Lightning\nNetwork now allow frictionless micropayments by reducing costs and minimising\nreliance on intermediaries. This development fosters an \"Internet of Value,\"\nwhere transferring even small amounts of money is as simple as sharing data.\nThis study investigates integrating Lightning Network-based micropayment\nstrategies into Q&A platforms, aiming to create a knowledge market free of\nminimum payment barriers. A survey was conducted to address the gap below the\n$2 payment level identified in prior research. Responses confirmed that\nincentives for asking and answering weaken as payments decrease. Findings\nreveal even minimal payments, such as {\\pounds}0.01, significantly encourage\nhigher quality and effort in responses. The study recommends micropayment\nincentives for service-oriented applications, particularly Q&A platforms. By\nleveraging the Lightning Network to remove barriers, a more open marketplace\ncan emerge, improving engagement and outcomes. Further research is needed to\nconfirm if users follow through on reported intentions when spending funds.",

    "abstract": "As power systems become more complex with the continuous integration of\nintelligent distributed energy resources (DERs), new risks and uncertainties\narise. Consequently, to enhance system resiliency, it is essential to account\nfor various uncertain events when implementing the optimization problem for the\nenergy management system (EMS). This paper presents a preventive EMS\nconsidering the probability of failure (PoF) of each system component across\ndifferent scenarios. A conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR)-based framework is\nproposed to integrate the uncertainties of the distribution network. Loads are\nclassified into critical, semi-critical, and non-critical categories to\nprioritize essential loads during generation resource shortages. A proximal\npolicy optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning (RL) agent is used to\nsolve the formulated problem and generate the control decisions. The proposed\nframework is evaluated on a notional MVDC ship system and a modified IEEE\n30-bus system, where the results demonstrate that the PPO agent can\nsuccessfully optimize the objective function while maintaining the network and\noperational constraints. For validation, the RL-based method is benchmarked\nagainst a traditional optimization approach, further highlighting its\neffectiveness and robustness. This comparison shows that RL agents can offer\nmore resiliency against future uncertain events compared to the traditional\nsolution methods due to their adaptability and learning capacity.",

However, the extreme\nreactivity of lithium metal and its SEI presents challenges in investigating\ndeposition and stripping mechanisms. In this work, we systematically evaluated\nthe storage stability of lithium metal in glovebox before and after\nelectrochemical deposition. We then assessed different FIB ion sources for\ntheir impact on lithium metal lamella preparation for transmission electron\nmicroscopy.

We\nconstruct a model to explain these observations in the quark sector. We\nintroduce a spectrum of new particles consisting of six of each -- massive\nsinglet vector-like quarks (VLQs), singlet scalars, and SU(2)-doublet scalars.\nSM quark masses are generated when the neutral components of the SU(2)-doublet\nscalars acquire non-zero vacuum expectation values (VEVs). We impose global\nsymmetries to ensure that Yukawa couplings stay roughly flavor diagonal and\ndemocratic (of the same order), as well as to suppress tree-level\nflavor-changing neutral currents. Quark-mass hierarchy then follows from a\nhierarchy in scalar VEVs. The singlet scalars also acquire weak-scale VEVs.\nTogether with the VLQs, they act as messengers between different generations of\nquarks in the SM. These messenger particles are responsible for generating the\nelements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Masakawa (CKM) matrix which depend on the\nratios of the singlet VEVs and VLQ masses. Constructed this way, the CKM matrix\nis found to be \\emph{independent} of the SM fermion masses.

Their ability to\ngenerate human-like text has opened new possibilities for market research,\nparticularly in conjoint analysis, where understanding consumer preferences is\nessential but often resource-intensive. Traditional survey-based methods face\nlimitations in scalability and cost, making LLM-generated data a promising\nalternative. However, while LLMs have the potential to simulate real consumer\nbehavior, recent studies highlight a significant gap between LLM-generated and\nhuman data, with biases introduced when substituting between the two. In this\npaper, we address this gap by proposing a novel statistical data augmentation\napproach that efficiently integrates LLM-generated data with real data in\nconjoint analysis. Our method leverages transfer learning principles to debias\nthe LLM-generated data using a small amount of human data. This results in\nstatistically robust estimators with consistent and asymptotically normal\nproperties, in contrast to naive approaches that simply substitute human data\nwith LLM-generated data, which can exacerbate bias. We validate our framework\nthrough an empirical study on COVID-19 vaccine preferences, demonstrating its\nsuperior ability to reduce estimation error and save data and costs by 24.9% to\n79.8%. In contrast, naive approaches fail to save data due to the inherent\nbiases in LLM-generated data compared to human data. Another empirical study on\nsports car choices validates the robustness of our results.

We find that this approach can reduce the\nnumber of variables in a classical neural network by a factor of 135 while\npreserving its learnability. In addition, we develop a dropout method to\nenhance the robustness of quantum machine learning models, which are highly\nsusceptible to adversarial attacks. This technique can also be applied to\nimprove the adversarial resilience of the classical weight-constrained neural\nnetwork, which is essential for industry applications, such as self-driving\nvehicles. Our work offers a novel approach to reduce the complexity of large\nclassical neural networks, addressing a critical challenge in machine learning.",

FedBAT seamlessly integrates hybrid adversarial training and\nself-adversarial distillation into the conventional FL framework from data\naugmentation and feature distillation perspectives. From a data augmentation\nperspective, we propose hybrid adversarial training to defend against\nadversarial attacks by balancing accuracy and robustness through a weighted\ncombination of standard and adversarial training. From a feature distillation\nperspective, we introduce a novel augmentation-invariant adversarial\ndistillation method that aligns local adversarial features of augmented images\nwith their corresponding unbiased global clean features. This alignment can\neffectively mitigate bias from data heterogeneity while enhancing both the\nrobustness and generalization of the global model. Extensive experimental\nresults across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedBAT yields comparable or\nsuperior performance gains in improving robustness while maintaining accuracy\ncompared to several baselines.",

Two types\nof CLTs are derived for the (non-centered) adjacency matrix and the centered\nadjacency matrix, with different scaling factors when the sparsity parameter\n$p$ satisfies $np = n^{\\Omega(1)}$, and with the same scaling factor when $np =\nn^{o(1)}$. In both cases, the limiting covariance is expressed in terms of\nhomomorphism densities from certain types of finite graphs to a graphon.

For the non-centered adjacency matrix, we also\nidentify new phase transitions for the CLTs in the sparse regime when $n^{1/m}\n\\ll np \\ll n^{1/(m-1)}$ for $m \\geq 2$.

In the present\nstudy, we performed the first experimental demonstration of TPG stimulated over\none mode of the triplet, mode 1, the previous work on TPG concerning\nstimulation over two modes,2 and 3. The nonlinear medium is a KTiOPO4 crystal\npumped in the picosecond regime (15 ps, 10 Hz) at a pump wavelength of 532 nm.\nThe stimulation beam is emitted by a tunable optical parametric generator: the\nphase-matching was found at a stimulation wavelength of 1491 nm, the other two\nmodes of the triplet being both at 1654 nm in orthogonal polarizations. Using\nsuperconducting nanowires single photon detectors, the measurement of the\npolarizations and wavelength signatures of the two generated modes are in full\nagreement with calculations.

For evaluation, we divided the entire\ndataset into two subsets: a smaller group with annotations and a larger group\nwithout annotations.

    "abstract": "The increasing scale of manycore systems poses significant challenges in\nmanaging reliability while meeting performance demands. Simultaneously, these\nsystems become more susceptible to different aging mechanisms such as\nnegative-bias temperature instability (NBTI), hot carrier injection (HCI), and\nthermal cycling (TC), as well as the electromigration (EM) phenomenon. In this\npaper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based task mapping method to\nimprove the reliability of manycore systems considering the aforementioned\naging mechanisms, which consists of three steps including bin packing,\ntask-to-bin mapping, and task-to-core mapping. In the initial step, a\ndensity-based spatial application with noise (DBSCAN) clustering method is\nemployed to compose some clusters (bins) based on the cores temperature. Then,\nthe Q-learning algorithm is used for the two latter steps, to map the arrived\ntask on a core such that the minimum thermal variation is occurred among all\nthe bins. Compared to the state-of-the-art works, the proposed method is\nperformed during runtime without requiring any parameter to be calculated\noffline. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is evaluated on 16, 32,\nand 64 cores systems using SPLASH2 and PARSEC benchmark suite applications. The\nresults demonstrate up to 27% increase in the mean time to failure (MTTF)\ncompared to the state-of-the-art task mapping techniques.",

A striking example is split vacancies, where an isolated atomic\nvacancy transforms to a stoichiometry-conserving complex of two vacancies and\nan interstitial ($V_X \\rightarrow [V_X + X_i + V_X]$), which can be accompanied\nby a dramatic energy lowering and change in behaviour.

This approach allows the screening of all solid-state compounds in the\nMaterials Project database (including all entries in the ICSD, along with\nseveral thousand predicted metastable materials), identifying thousands of low\nenergy split vacancy configurations, hitherto unknown.

Recent studies either\ndevelop tool-using or unify specific visual tasks into the autoregressive\nframework, often at the expense of overall multimodal performance. To address\nthis issue and enhance MLLMs with visual tasks in a scalable fashion, we\npropose Task Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel method that utilizes\ndifferentiable task preferences derived from typical fine-grained visual tasks.\nTPO introduces learnable task tokens that establish connections between\nmultiple task-specific heads and the MLLM.

Since our\nprimary interest lies in extra-galactic sources, we focus on UGSs located\noutside the Galactic plane (|b| > 10$^{\\circ}$). Due to the large number of\nsources (about 1800 UGS), we developed a pipeline to automatise the search for\ncounterparts and significantly reduce the computational time for the analysis.\nOur association process begins by identifying potential X-ray counterparts for\neach UGS; if one is found, we further look for corresponding radio and optical\ncounterparts in the X-ray counterpart error box, thus minimizing ambiguities.\nResults. Out of the 1284 UGSs in the 4FGL-DR4 catalog, 714 were observed at\nleast once by Swift/XRT.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise in simulated\nenvironments, such as games, where failures have minimal consequences. However,\nthe deployment of RL agents in real-world systems such as autonomous vehicles,\nrobotics, UAVs, and medical devices demands a higher level of safety and\ntransparency, particularly when facing adversarial threats. Safe RL algorithms\nhave been developed to address these concerns by optimizing both task\nperformance and safety constraints. However, errors are inevitable, and when\nthey occur, it is essential that the RL agents can also explain their actions\nto human operators. This makes trust in the safety mechanisms of RL systems\ncrucial for effective deployment. Explainability plays a key role in building\nthis trust by providing clear, actionable insights into the agent's\ndecision-making process, ensuring that safety-critical decisions are well\nunderstood. While machine learning (ML) has seen significant advances in\ninterpretability and visualization, explainability methods for RL remain\nlimited. Current tools fail to address the dynamic, sequential nature of RL and\nits needs to balance task performance with safety constraints over time. The\nre-purposing of traditional ML methods, such as saliency maps, is inadequate\nfor safety-critical RL applications where mistakes can result in severe\nconsequences. To bridge this gap, we propose xSRL, a framework that integrates\nboth local and global explanations to provide a comprehensive understanding of\nRL agents' behavior. xSRL also enables developers to identify policy\nvulnerabilities through adversarial attacks, offering tools to debug and patch\nagents without retraining. Our experiments and user studies demonstrate xSRL's\neffectiveness in increasing safety in RL systems, making them more reliable and\ntrustworthy for real-world deployment.

    "abstract": "The semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) process requires the\npresence of an identified hadron H$'$ in the final state, which arises from the\nscattering of a lepton with an initial hadron P. By employing factorization in\nquantum chromodynamics (QCD), SIDIS provides essential knowledge on the hadron\nstructure, enabling the exploration of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and\nfragmentation functions (FFs). The coefficient functions for SIDIS can be\ncalculated in perturbative QCD and are currently known to the\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) for the cases, where the incoming lepton\nand the hadron P are either both polarized or unpolarized. We present a\ndetailed description of these NNLO computations, including a thorough\ndiscussion of all the partonic channels, the calculation of the amplitudes and\nmaster integrals for the phase-space integration as well as the renormalization\nof ultraviolet divergences and mass factorization of infrared divergences in\ndimensional regularization through NNLO. We provide an extensive\nphenomenological analysis of the effects of NNLO corrections on SIDIS cross\nsections for different PDFs and FFs and various kinematics, including those of\nthe future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). We find that these corrections are not\nonly significant but also crucial for reducing the dependence on the\nrenormalization and factorization scales $\\mu_R$ and $\\mu_F$ to obtain stable\npredictions.",

I find that sanctions significantly\ninfluence migration patterns by disrupting oil revenues, which fund imports\ncritical to productivity in the non-oil sector.

As such, it can greatly reduce\nthe large negative performance and energy impact of data access and data\nmovement, by 1) fundamentally avoiding data movement, 2) reducing data access\nlatency & energy, and 3) exploiting large parallelism of memory arrays. Many\nrecent studies show that memory-centric computing can largely improve system\nperformance & energy efficiency. Major industrial vendors and startup companies\nhave recently introduced memory chips with sophisticated computation\ncapabilities. Going forward, both hardware and software stack should be\nrevisited and designed carefully to take advantage of memory-centric computing.\n  This work describes several major recent advances in memory-centric\ncomputing, specifically in Processing-in-DRAM, a paradigm where the operational\ncharacteristics of a DRAM chip are exploited and enhanced to perform\ncomputation on data stored in DRAM. Specifically, we describe 1) new techniques\nthat slightly modify DRAM chips to enable both enhanced computation capability\nand easier programmability, 2) new experimental studies that demonstrate the\nfunctionally-complete bulk-bitwise computational capability of real commercial\noff-the-shelf DRAM chips, without any modifications to the DRAM chip or the\ninterface, and 3) new DRAM designs that improve access granularity &\nefficiency, unleashing the true potential of Processing-in-DRAM.",

However, their broader adoption has been hindered by bulky\nprojector designs and complex optical module assemblies. Here, we introduce a\nnew laser display architecture enabled by large-scale visible photonic\nintegrated circuits (PICs) to address these challenges. Unlike previous\nprojector-style laser displays, this architecture features an ultra-thin,\nflat-panel form factor, replacing bulky free-space illumination modules with a\nsingle, high-performance photonic chip. Centimeter-scale PIC devices, which\nintegrate thousands of distinct optical components on-chip, are carefully\ntailored to achieve high display uniformity, contrast, and efficiency. We\ndemonstrate a 2 mm-thick flat-panel laser display combining the PIC with a\nliquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCoS) panel, achieving 211% of the color gamut and\nmore than 80% volume reduction compared to traditional LCoS displays.

These systems employ their own systems software (i.e.\nrobotic middleware and frameworks) and execute distinct components to\nfacilitate interaction with various sensors and actuators, and other robotic\ncomponents (e.g. cognitive subsystems). Furthermore, as cyber-physical systems,\nthey engage in interactions with humans and their physical environment, as\nexemplified by social robots.

However, the experimental\ndetermination of the spin-parity is often challenging, leaving it undetermined\nin many nuclei. Purpose: We discuss how the shell structure affects the density\nprofiles of nuclei in the island of inversion and investigate whether these can\nbe probed from the total reaction and elastic scattering cross sections.\nMethod: The antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) is employed to generate\nvarious particle-hole configurations and predict the energy levels of these\nnuclei. The obtained density distributions are used as inputs to the Glauber\nmodel, which is employed to calculate the total reaction and elastic scattering\ncross sections for revealing their relationship to the particle-hole\nconfigurations. Results: In addition to the well-known correlation between\nnuclear deformation and radius, we show the correlations between the\nparticle-hole configurations and both central density and diffuseness. We show\nthat different particle-hole configurations are well reflected in the total\nreaction and elastic scattering cross sections. Conclusion: The total reaction\nand elastic scattering cross sections are useful probes to identify the\nspin-parity of nuclei when different particle-hole configurations coexist.",

An important leap\nforward for understanding jet launching could be made by identifying a larger\nnumber of suitable objects, characterized by different accretion modes and jet\npowers. In this article, we present 1 cm and 7 mm VLBI data of a sample of 16\npoorly explored radio galaxies, comprising both High-Excitation (HEG) and\nLow-Excitation Galaxies (LEG) and spanning a large range in radio power. The\ncombination of the sources vicinity (z<0.1) with a large black hole mass\n($\\log{M_{\\rm BH}}$>8.5) results in a high spatial resolution in units of\nSchwarzschild radii ($<10^3-10^4$ $R_{\\rm S}$), necessary for probing the\nregion where the jet is initially accelerated and collimated. We aim at\nidentifying the best candidates for follow-up observations with current and\nfuture VLBI facilities. The observations were performed with the High\nSensitivity Array, including Effelsberg and the phased-VLA, which has allowed\nus to characterize the sub-parsec properties of these faint jets and to\nestimate their core brightness temperature and orientation. The number of\nsources imaged on scales $\\lesssim 10^3$ $R_{\\rm S}$ is more than doubled by\nour study. All targets were detected at both frequencies, and several present\ntwo-sided jet structures. Several LEG jets show hints of limb-brightening. The\ncore brightness temperatures are generally below the equipartition value,\nindicating that equipartition has not yet been reached and/or that the emission\nis de-boosted. Among LEG, we identify 3C31, 3C66B, and 3C465 as the most\npromising, combining a relatively high flux density (>50 mJy) with superb\nspatial resolution (<500 $R_{\\rm S}$) at 7 mm. The powerful HEG 3C452 is\ninteresting as well due to its highly symmetric, two-sided jet base.",

In this paper, we introduce MEDEC\n(https://github.com/abachaa/MEDEC), the first publicly available benchmark for\nmedical error detection and correction in clinical notes, covering five types\nof errors (Diagnosis, Management, Treatment, Pharmacotherapy, and Causal\nOrganism). MEDEC consists of 3,848 clinical texts, including 488 clinical notes\nfrom three US hospital systems that were not previously seen by any LLM. The\ndataset has been used for the MEDIQA-CORR shared task to evaluate seventeen\nparticipating systems [Ben Abacha et al., 2024]. In this paper, we describe the\ndata creation methods and we evaluate recent LLMs (e.g., o1-preview, GPT-4,\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for the tasks of detecting and\ncorrecting medical errors requiring both medical knowledge and reasoning\ncapabilities.

Existing monitoring solutions\nutilizing different wearable sensors integrated with Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) offer a way to detect AA early enough for timely and adequate medical\nintervention.

The research creates a diverse dataset, consisting of three\ndistinct datasets gathered from 14 participants across multiple hospitals in\nCanada. These datasets have not been extensively explored due to their limited\nlabeling. We propose a novel approach employing self-training and a variational\nautoencoder (VAE) to detect AA in PwD effectively. The proposed approach aims\nto learn the representation of the features extracted using the VAE and then\nuses a semi-supervised block to generate labels, classify events, and detect\nAA. We demonstrate that combining Self-Training and Variational Autoencoder\nmechanism significantly improves model performance in classifying AA in PwD.\nAmong the tested techniques, the XGBoost classifier achieved the highest\naccuracy of 90.16\\%.

    "abstract": "Real-time speech enhancement (SE) is essential to online speech\ncommunication. Causal SE models use only the previous context while predicting\nfuture information, such as phoneme continuation, may help performing causal\nSE. The phonetic information is often represented by quantizing latent features\nof self-supervised learning (SSL) models. This work is the first to incorporate\nSSL features with causality into an SE model. The causal SSL features are\nencoded and combined with spectrogram features using feature-wise linear\nmodulation to estimate a mask for enhancing the noisy input speech.\nSimultaneously, we quantize the causal SSL features using vector quantization\nto represent phonetic characteristics as semantic tokens. The model not only\nencodes SSL features but also predicts the future semantic tokens in multi-task\nlearning (MTL). The experimental results using VoiceBank + DEMAND dataset show\nthat our proposed method achieves 2.88 in PESQ, especially with semantic\nprediction MTL, in which we confirm that the semantic prediction played an\nimportant role in causal SE.",

The efficiency to generate non-equilibrium magnons\nacross interfaces is parametrized by the spin conductance gs, a\nphenomenological constant that is considered to be dependent on thermal\nmagnons. Here, we investigate non-linear magnetoresistance phenomena originated\nin Pt due to current-driven nonequilibrium magnons in Y3Fe5O12 (YIG).\nRemarkably, we find that spin-flip scattering processes are dominated by\nsubthermal magnons at room temperature, resulting in a large modulation of gs\nwith the magnetic field and YIG thickness. Concretely, we find that decreasing\nthe YIG thickness from 100 to 10 nm increases gs by a factor 30 and observe\nthat the magnetic field exponentially suppresses the magnon generation\nefficiency. These findings challenge current understanding on gs and indicate\nthat electrically-driven magnonic effects such as damping compensation and\nmagnon condensation can be largely boosted by device miniaturization.",

In this work we study the problem of detecting genuine\ntripartite entanglement among systems of indistinguishable bosons.

Specifically, OPT, which is a GPT-3 based LLM, shows the\nhighest accuracy in sentiment prediction with an accuracy of 74.4%, slightly\nahead of BERT (72.5%) and FINBERT (72.2%). In contrast, the Loughran-McDonald\ndictionary model demonstrates considerably lower effectiveness with only 50.1%\naccuracy. Regression analyses highlight a robust positive impact of OPT model\nscores on next-day stock returns, with coefficients of 0.274 and 0.254 in\ndifferent model specifications.

This paper\nintroduces a diffusion model-based IPv6 target generation algorithm called\n6Diffusion. 6Diffusion first maps addresses to vector space for language\nmodeling, adds noise to active IPv6 addresses in the forward process, diffusing\nthem throughout the entire IPv6 address space, and then performs a reverse\nprocess to gradually denoise and recover to active IPv6 addresses. We use the\nDDIM sampler to increase the speed of generating candidate sets. At the same\ntime, we introduce the GLF-MSA (Global-Local Fusion Multi-Head Self-Attention)\nmechanism to adapt to the top-down global allocation pattern of IPv6 addresses\nand the local characteristics of IPv6 address segments, thus better learning\nthe deep-level features of active IPv6 addresses. Experimental results show\nthat compared to existing methods, 6Diffusion can generate higher quality\ncandidate sets and outperforms state-of-the-art target generation algorithms\nacross multiple metrics.",

    "abstract": "Handling latent variables in Structural Equation Models (SEMs) in a case\nwhere both the latent variables and their corresponding indicators in the\nmeasurement error part of the model are random curves presents significant\nchallenges, especially with sparse data. In this paper, we develop a novel\nfamily of Functional Structural Equation Models (FSEMs) that incorporate latent\nvariables modeled as Gaussian Processes (GPs). The introduced FSEMs are built\nupon functional regression models having response variables modeled as\nunderlying GPs. The model flexibly adapts to cases when the random curves'\nrealizations are observed only over a sparse subset of the domain, and the\ninferential framework is based on a restricted maximum likelihood approach. The\nadvantage of this framework lies in its ability and flexibility in handling\nvarious data scenarios, including regularly and irregularly spaced points and\nthus missing data. To extract smooth estimates for the functional parameters,\nwe employ a penalized likelihood approach that selects the smoothing parameters\nusing a cross-validation method. We evaluate the performance of the proposed\nmodel using simulation studies and a real data example, which suggests that our\nmodel performs well in practice. The uncertainty associated with the estimates\nof the functional coefficients is also assessed by constructing confidence\nregions for each estimate. The goodness of fit indices that are commonly used\nto evaluate the fit of SEMs are developed for the FSEMs introduced in this\npaper.

When the companion star is positioned between\nthe pulsar and the Earth, the pulsar radiation beam will pass through the\ncompanion's magnetic field, potentially leading to axion-photon conversion that\naffects the intensity and linear polarization of the photons. The advantage of\nusing such systems for axion or axion-like particle (ALP) research is that the\nintrinsic intensity and polarization state of the source photons can be well\ndetermined. This work analyzes the axion-photon conversion and the magnetic\nfield along the photon path, establishing the corresponding model and solving\nit numerically. We choose PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J1910-5959A for our study. By\nassuming the companion's magnetic field, magnetic axis angle, and detector\nsensitivity, we discuss the feasibility of using high Shapiro delay binary\nsystems to constrain the axion/ALP parameter space. We find that the upper\nlimits derived from these two sources are weaker then existing constraints.\nHowever, considering the higher reliability, the method proposed in this work\nis still valuable. As more suitable samples and richer observational results\nare discovered, further constraints on the axion parameters could be\nstrengthened.",

In the real world, however, the graph data can\nsuffer from significant distribution shifts across clients as the clients may\ncollect their graph data for different purposes. In particular, graph\nproperties are usually associated with invariant label-relevant substructures\n(i.e., subgraphs) across clients, while label-irrelevant substructures can\nappear in a client-specific manner. The issue of distribution shifts of graph\ndata hinders the efficiency of GNN training and leads to serious performance\ndegradation in FGL. To tackle the aforementioned issue, we propose a novel FGL\nframework entitled FedVN that eliminates distribution shifts through\nclient-specific graph augmentation strategies with multiple learnable Virtual\nNodes (VNs). Specifically, FedVN lets the clients jointly learn a set of shared\nVNs while training a global GNN model. To eliminate distribution shifts, each\nclient trains a personalized edge generator that determines how the VNs connect\nlocal graphs in a client-specific manner. Furthermore, we provide theoretical\nanalyses indicating that FedVN can eliminate distribution shifts of graph data\nacross clients. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets under five settings\ndemonstrate the superiority of our proposed FedVN over nine baselines.",

Various methods have been proposed for fake\nnews detection, including text-based approaches as well as a series of\ngraph-based approaches. However, the deceptive nature of fake news renders\ntext-based approaches less effective. Propagation tree-based methods focus on\nthe propagation process of individual news, capturing pairwise relationships\nbut lacking the capability to capture high-order complex relationships. Large\nheterogeneous graph-based approaches necessitate the incorporation of\nsubstantial additional information beyond news text and user data, while\nhypergraph-based approaches rely on predefined hypergraph structures. To tackle\nthese issues, we propose a novel dynamic hypergraph-based multi-view fake news\ndetection model (DHy-MFND) that learns news embeddings across three distinct\nviews: text-level, propagation tree-level, and hypergraph-level. By employing\nhypergraph structures to model complex high-order relationships among multiple\nnews pieces and introducing dynamic hypergraph structure learning, we optimize\npredefined hypergraph structures while learning news embeddings. Additionally,\nwe introduce contrastive learning to capture authenticity-relevant embeddings\nacross different views.

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of citizen science initiatives has led to a significant\ngrowth of biodiversity databases, and particularly presence-only (PO)\nobservations. PO data are invaluable for understanding species distributions\nand their dynamics, but their use in a Species Distribution Model (SDM) is\ncurtailed by sampling biases and the lack of information on absences. Poisson\npoint processes are widely used for SDMs, with Maxent being one of the most\npopular methods. Maxent maximises the entropy of a probability distribution\nacross sites as a function of predefined transformations of variables, called\nfeatures. In contrast, neural networks and deep learning have emerged as a\npromising technique for automatic feature extraction from complex input\nvariables. Arbitrarily complex transformations of input variables can be\nlearned from the data efficiently through backpropagation and stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD). In this paper, we propose DeepMaxent, which harnesses\nneural networks to automatically learn shared features among species, using the\nmaximum entropy principle. To do so, it employs a normalised Poisson loss where\nfor each species, presence probabilities across sites are modelled by a neural\nnetwork. We evaluate DeepMaxent on a benchmark dataset known for its spatial\nsampling biases, using PO data for calibration and presence-absence (PA) data\nfor validation across six regions with different biological groups and\ncovariates. Our results indicate that DeepMaxent performs better than Maxent\nand other leading SDMs across all regions and taxonomic groups. The method\nperforms particularly well in regions of uneven sampling, demonstrating\nsubstantial potential to increase SDM performances. In particular, our approach\nyields more accurate predictions than traditional single-species models, which\nopens up new possibilities for methodological enhancement.",

During the inflationary period all\ndimensions (compact and non-compact) expand exponentially in terms of the 5D\nproper time. This set-up requires about 40 $e$-folds to expand the fifth\ndimension from the fundamental length to the micron size. At the end of 5D\ninflation (or at any given moment during the inflationary phase) one can\ninterpret the solution in terms of 4D fields using 4D Planck units from the\nrelation $M_p^2 = 2 \\pi R M_*^3$, which amounts going to the 4D Einstein frame.\nThis implies that if the compactification radius $R$ expands $N$ $e$-folds,\nthen the 3D space would expand $3N/2$ $e$-folds as a result of a uniform 5D\ninflation. We reexamine the primordial power spectrum predicted by this model\nand show that it is consistent with Planck's measurements of the comic\nmicrowave background.

To address this\nissue, we propose a novel data-adaptive Discriminative Spherical\nSliced-Wasserstein (DSSW) distance, which utilizes a projected energy function\nto determine the discriminative projection direction for SSW. In our new DSSW,\nwe introduce two types of projected energy functions to generate the weights\nfor projection directions with complete theoretical guarantees. The first type\nemploys a non-parametric deterministic function that transforms the projected\nWasserstein distance into its corresponding weight in each projection\ndirection. This improves the performance of the original SSW distance with\nnegligible additional computational overhead. The second type utilizes a neural\nnetwork-induced function that learns the projection direction weight through a\nparameterized neural network based on data projections. This further enhances\nthe performance of the original SSW distance with less extra computational\noverhead.

With the advent of the Gaia mission, we have an\nexceptional opportunity to revisit and enhance these studies with ages and\nmasses from high quality data. Aims. To build a comprehensive Gaia-based OC\nmass catalogue which, combined with the age distribution, allows a deeper\ninvestigation of the disruption experienced by OCs within the solar\nneighbourhood. Methods. Masses were determined by comparing luminosity\ndistributions to theoretical luminosity functions. The limiting and core radii\nof the clusters were obtained by fitting the King function to their observed\ndensity profiles. We examined the disruption process through simulations of the\nbuild-up and mass evolution of a population of OCs which were compared to the\nobserved mass and age distributions. Results. Our analysis yielded an OC mass\ndistribution with a peak at $log(M)$ = 2.7 dex ($\\sim 500 M_{\\odot}$), as well\nas radii for 1724 OCs. Our simulations showed that using a power-law Initial\nCluster Mass Function (ICMF) no parameters were able to reproduce the observed\nmass distribution. Moreover, we find that a skew log-normal ICMF provides a\ngood match to the observations and that the disruption time of a $10^4\nM{_\\odot}$ OC is $t_4^{tot} = 2.9 \\pm 0.4$ Gyr. Conclusions. Our results\nindicate that the OC disruption time $t_4^{tot}$ is about twice longer than\nprevious estimates based solely on OC age distributions. We find that the shape\nof the ICMF for bound OCs differs from that of embedded clusters, which could\nimply a low typical star formation efficiency of $\\leq 20\\%$ in OCs. Our\nresults also suggest a lower limit of $\\sim 60 M{_\\odot}$ for bound OCs in the\nsolar neighbourhood.",

This paper\nintroduces a novel method called Graph Attention-based Instance Selection\n(GAIS), which leverages Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to identify the most\ninformative instances in a dataset. GAIS represents the data as a graph and\nuses GATs to learn node representations, enabling it to capture complex\nrelationships between instances. The method processes data in chunks, applies\nrandom masking and similarity thresholding during graph construction, and\nselects instances based on confidence scores from the trained GAT model.\nExperiments on 13 diverse datasets demonstrate that GAIS consistently\noutperforms traditional IS methods in terms of effectiveness, achieving high\nreduction rates (average 96\\%) while maintaining or improving model\nperformance. Although GAIS exhibits slightly higher computational costs, its\nsuperior performance in maintaining accuracy with significantly reduced\ntraining data makes it a promising approach for graph-based data selection.",

The existing DMER methods struggle to capture long-term dependencies\nwhen dealing with sequence data, which limits their performance. Furthermore,\nthese methods often overlook the influence of individual differences on emotion\nperception, even though everyone has their own personalized emotional\nperception in the real world. Motivated by these issues, we explore more\neffective sequence processing methods and introduce the Personalized DMER\n(PDMER) problem, which requires models to predict emotions that align with\npersonalized perception. Specifically, we propose a Dual-Scale Attention-Based\nMeta-Learning (DSAML) method. This method fuses features from a dual-scale\nfeature extractor and captures both short and long-term dependencies using a\ndual-scale attention transformer, improving the performance in traditional\nDMER. To achieve PDMER, we design a novel task construction strategy that\ndivides tasks by annotators. Samples in a task are annotated by the same\nannotator, ensuring consistent perception. Leveraging this strategy alongside\nmeta-learning, DSAML can predict personalized perception of emotions with just\none personalized annotation sample.

The\nestimated depth is utilized to adjust the camera-to-subject distance by moving\nthe camera farther, increasing the camera focal length, and reprojecting the 3D\nimage features to the new perspective. The reprojected features are then fed to\nan inpainting module to fill in the missing pixels. We leverage a\ndifferentiable renderer to enable end-to-end training of our depth estimation\nand feature extraction nets to improve the rectified outputs. To boost the\nresults of the inpainting module, we incorporate an auxiliary module to predict\nthe horizontal movement of the camera which decreases the area that requires\nhallucination of challenging face parts such as ears.

This model introduces a multi-head self-attention\nmechanism based on the consensus-aware visual semantic embedding model (CVSE)\nto capture information in multiple subspaces in parallel, significantly\nenhancing the model's ability to understand and represent the complex\nrelationship between images and texts. In addition, we adopt a parameterized\nfeature fusion strategy to flexibly integrate feature information at different\nlevels, further improving the model's expressive power. In terms of loss\nfunction design, the MH-CVSE model adopts a dynamic weight adjustment strategy\nto dynamically adjust the weight according to the loss value itself, so that\nthe model can better balance the contribution of different loss terms during\ntraining. At the same time, we introduce a cosine annealing learning rate\nstrategy to help the model converge more stably in the later stages of\ntraining. Extensive experimental verification on the Flickr30k dataset shows\nthat the MH-CVSE model achieves better performance than previous methods in\nboth bidirectional image and text retrieval tasks, fully demonstrating its\neffectiveness and superiority.",

We confirm the tetragonal crystal structure of\nErPd$_2$Si$_2$ within the $I4/mmm$ space group. Notably, we observed\nanisotropic thermal expansion, with the lattice constant $a$ expanding and $c$\ncontracting between 15 K and 300 K. This behavior is attributed to lattice\nvibrations and electronic contributions. Heat capacity measurements revealed\nthree distinct temperature regimes: $T_1 \\sim 3.0$ K, $T_\\textrm{N} \\sim 4.20$\nK, and $T_2 \\sim 15.31$ K. These correspond to the disappearance of\nspin-density waves, the onset of an incommensurate antiferromagnetic (AFM)\nstructure, and the crystal-field splitting and/or the presence of short-range\nspin fluctuations, respectively. Remarkably, the AFM phase transition anomaly\nwas observed exclusively in low-field magnetization data (120 Oe) at\n$T_\\textrm{N}$. A high magnetic field ($B =$ 3 T) effectively suppressed this\nanomaly, likely due to spin-flop and spin-flip transitions. Furthermore, the\nextracted effective PM moments closely matched the expected theoretical value,\nsuggesting a dominant magnetic contribution from localized 4$f$ spins of Er.\nAdditionally, significant differences in resistance ($R$) values at low\ntemperatures under applied $B$ indicated a magnetoresistance (MR) effect with a\nminimum value of -4.36\\%. Notably, the measured MR effect exhibited anisotropic\nbehavior, where changes in the strength or direction of the applied $B$ induced\nvariations in the MR effect. A twofold symmetry of $R$ was discerned at 3 T and\n9 T, originating from the orientation of spin moments relative to the applied\n$B$. Intriguingly, above $T_\\textrm{N}$, short-range spin fluctuations also\ndisplayed a preferred orientation along the $c$-axis due to single-ion\nanisotropy.",

    "abstract": "Top-$K$ recommendation involves inferring latent user preferences and\ngenerating personalized recommendations accordingly, which is now ubiquitous in\nvarious decision systems. Nonetheless, recommender systems usually suffer from\nsevere \\textit{popularity bias}, leading to the over-recommendation of popular\nitems. Such a bias deviates from the central aim of reflecting user preference\nfaithfully, compromising both customer satisfaction and retailer profits.\nDespite the prevalence, existing methods tackling popularity bias still have\nlimitations due to the considerable accuracy-debias tradeoff and the\nsensitivity to extensive parameter selection, further exacerbated by the\nextreme sparsity in positive user-item interactions.\n  In this paper, we present a \\textbf{Pop}ularity-aware top-$K$ recommendation\nalgorithm integrating multi-behavior \\textbf{S}ide \\textbf{I}nformation\n(PopSI), aiming to enhance recommendation accuracy and debias performance\nsimultaneously. Specifically, by leveraging multiple user feedback that mirrors\nsimilar user preferences and formulating it as a three-dimensional tensor,\nPopSI can utilize all slices to capture the desiring user preferences\neffectively. Subsequently, we introduced a novel orthogonality constraint to\nrefine the estimated item feature space, enforcing it to be invariant to item\npopularity features thereby addressing our model's sensitivity to popularity\nbias. Comprehensive experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets demonstrate\nthe general improvements of PopSI over state-of-the-art debias methods with a\nmarginal accuracy-debias tradeoff and scalability to practical applications.\nThe source code for our algorithm and experiments is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/Eason-sys/PopSI}.",

By applying Short-Time\nFourier Transform (STFT) analysis, the algorithm effectively accommodates the\nrapid increase in revolution frequency from 4 MHz to 7.5 MHz over 0.35 seconds,\nalong with tune shifts.

Preliminarly, it is discussed how the determination of\nthe fluctuational patterns starting from the Gaussian approach to Markov\nprocesses is practically unfeasible, and the moment analysis provides the\nsimplest way to achieve it. We show the existence of an uncountable family of\nwhite-noise processes, different from the distributional derivatives of Wiener\nprocesses, and satisfying the requirement of fluctuational independence, i.e.\nthe basic assumption on thermal fluctuations in the Kubo theory based on the\nLangevin condition.

The POC-ViT framework is designed to handle two biometric\ntraits and to capture inter-dependencies in terms of relative structural\npatterns. Each channel consists of a Cross-Attention using phase-only\ncorrelation (POC) that captures both their individual and correlated structural\npatterns. The computation of cross-attention using POC extracts the phase\ncorrelation in the spatial features.

This desire for higher\ncarrier frequency or more bandwidth led the researchers to take advantage of\nthe terahertz (THz) spectrum.

In the\ndevelopment of THz communication systems, the antenna is the most significant\ncomponent. The focus is especially on designing highly directive antennas\nbecause they enhance the performance of the overall system by compensating for\nthe large path loss at THz and thus improving the signal-to-noise ratio. This\nchapter presents different types of THz antennas, including planar,\nreflectarray, horn antenna, and lens antenna. Emphasis has been made to present\nthe latest trend of designing THz antennas using carbon-based materials, such\nas graphene and carbon nanotubes. The performance of these antennas has been\ncompared with that of traditional copper-based THz antennas by critically\nanalyzing their properties.

Recent advancements in DETR-based visual grounding\nmethods have attracted considerable attention, as they directly predict the\ncoordinates of the target object without relying on additional efforts, such as\npre-generated proposal candidates or pre-defined anchor boxes. However,\nexisting research primarily focuses on designing stronger multi-modal decoder,\nwhich typically generates learnable queries by random initialization or by\nusing linguistic embeddings. This vanilla query generation approach inevitably\nincreases the learning difficulty for the model, as it does not involve any\ntarget-related information at the beginning of decoding. Furthermore, they only\nuse the deepest image feature during the query learning process, overlooking\nthe importance of features from other levels. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel approach, called RefFormer. It consists of the query adaption\nmodule that can be seamlessly integrated into CLIP and generate the referential\nquery to provide the prior context for decoder, along with a task-specific\ndecoder. By incorporating the referential query into the decoder, we can\neffectively mitigate the learning difficulty of the decoder, and accurately\nconcentrate on the target object. Additionally, our proposed query adaption\nmodule can also act as an adapter, preserving the rich knowledge within CLIP\nwithout the need to tune the parameters of the backbone network.

    "abstract": "The design of porous infill structures presents significant challenges due to\ntheir complex geometric configurations, such as the accurate representation of\ngeometric boundaries and the control of localized maximum stress. In current\nmainstream design methods, such as topology optimization, the analysis is often\nperformed using pixel or voxel-based element approximations. These\napproximations, constrained by the optimization framework, result in\nsubstantial geometric discrepancies between the analysis model and the final\nphysical model. Such discrepancies can severely impact structural performance,\nparticularly for localized properties like stress response, where accurate\ngeometry is critical to mitigating stress concentration. To address these\nchallenges, we propose evolutionary de-homogenization, which is a design\nframework based on the integration of de-homogenization and data-driven\nmultifidelity optimization. This framework facilitates the hybrid solid-porous\ninfill design by bridging the gap between low-fidelity analysis and\nhigh-fidelity physical realizations, ensuring both geometric accuracy and\nenhanced structural performance. The low-fidelity level utilizes commonly used\ndensity control variables, while the high-fidelity level involves stress\nanalysis based on structures with precise geometric representations. By\nemploying a de-homogenization-based mapping method, a side-by-side\ncorrespondence between low-fidelity and high-fidelity results is established.\nThe low-fidelity control variables are iteratively adjusted to optimize the\nhigh-fidelity results by integrating deep generative model with multi-objective\nevolutionary algorithm.

Experiments\non DL models including PointNet, PointNet++, and DGCNN show that model\nperformance on SPC with real colors outperforms that on SPC with uniform colors\nby 8.2 % + on both OA and mIoU. Furthermore, a higher than 70 % mixing\nproportion of SPC usually leads to better performance.

    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge of online 3D model generation for neural\nrendering using an RGB image stream. Previous research has tackled this issue\nby incorporating Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\nas scene representations within dense SLAM methods. However, most studies focus\nprimarily on estimating coarse 3D scenes rather than achieving detailed\nreconstructions. Moreover, depth estimation based solely on images is often\nambiguous, resulting in low-quality 3D models that lead to inaccurate\nrenderings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework for\nhigh-quality 3DGS modeling that leverages an online multi-view stereo (MVS)\napproach. Our method estimates MVS depth using sequential frames from a local\ntime window and applies comprehensive depth refinement techniques to filter out\noutliers, enabling accurate initialization of Gaussians in 3DGS. Furthermore,\nwe introduce a parallelized backend module that optimizes the 3DGS model\nefficiently, ensuring timely updates with each new keyframe. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art dense SLAM\nmethods, particularly excelling in challenging outdoor environments.",

The flux equation consists of three terms: a diffusive term and two\nterms for high and low angle grain boundary (H/LAGB) trapping. Uptake\nsimulations showed that decreasing the grain size resulted in higher hydrogen\ncontent due to increasing the GB density. Permeation simulations showed that\nGBs are high flux paths due to their higher enrichment with hydrogen. Since\nHAGBs have higher enrichment than LAGBs, due to their higher trap-binding\nenergy, they generally have the highest hydrogen flux. Nevertheless, the flux\nshows a convoluted behavior as it depends on the local concentration, alignment\nof GB with external concentration gradient as well as the GB network\nconnectivity. Finally, decreasing the grain size resulted in a larger\nbreak-through time and a larger steady-state exit flux.",

To address this, we present the Shape-Differentiable\nRobot Simulator (SDRS), designed to be differentiable under significant robot\nshape changes. The core innovation of SDRS lies in its representation of robot\nshapes using a set of convex polyhedrons. This approach allows us to generalize\nsmooth, penalty-based contact mechanics for interactions between any pair of\nconvex polyhedrons. Using the separating hyperplane theorem, SDRS introduces a\nseparating plane for each pair of contacting convex polyhedrons. This\nseparating plane functions as a zero-mass auxiliary entity, with its state\ndetermined by the principle of least action. This setup ensures global\ndifferentiability, even as robot shapes undergo significant geometric and\ntopological changes. To demonstrate the practical value of SDRS, we provide\nexamples of robot co-design scenarios, where both robot shapes and control\nmovements are optimized simultaneously.",

We superpose various basis wave\nfunctions generated by the energy variation by imposing two types of\nconstraints: one incorporating the degree of the quadrupole deformation and the\nother taking care of the relative motion between a $^{16}$C core and a valence\nneutron. We find that the experimental energy level is well reproduced by the\npresent method, including both deformed and $^{16}$C+$n$ configurations. The\nground $3/2^{+}$ and second excited $5/2^{+}$ states exhibit a triaxially\ndeformed shape, while the main component of the first excited $1/2^{+}$ state\nis a $^{16}$C($0^{+}$) core plus an $s$-wave neutron configuration. The tail of\nthe valence neutron is significantly improved by including the $^{16}$C+$n$\nbasis functions explicitly. The explicit inclusion of both the quadrupole\ndeformation and the relative motion between a core and a valence neutron is\nessential to describe the coexistence phenomena observed in neutron-rich nuclei\nin the AMD+GCM framework.",

In order to better model the complex\ninterdependence between entities and the various inherent characteristics of\neach entity, the GNN based methods are widely adopted by existing methods. In\neach layer of GNN, node features aggregate information from their neighboring\nnodes to update their information. In doing so, from shallow layer to deep\nlayer in GNN, original individual node features continue to be weakened and\nmore structural information,i.e., from short-distance neighborhood to\nlong-distance neighborhood, continues to be enhanced. However, research to date\nhas largely ignored the understanding of how hierarchical graph information is\nrepresented and their characteristics that can benefit anomaly detection.\nExisting methods simply leverage the output from the last layer of GNN for\nanomaly estimation while neglecting the essential information contained in the\nintermediate GNN layers. To address such limitations, in this paper, we propose\na Graph Mixture of Experts (Graph-MoE) network for multivariate time series\nanomaly detection, which incorporates the mixture of experts (MoE) module to\nadaptively represent and integrate hierarchical multi-layer graph information\ninto entity representations. It is worth noting that our Graph-MoE can be\nintegrated into any GNN-based MTS anomaly detection method in a plug-and-play\nmanner.

Masked Autoencoder (MAE) excels in effectively using unlabeled data\nand learning image's global structures, enhancing model generalization and\nrobustness. However, in the CDFSL task with significant domain shifts, we find\nMAE even shows lower performance than the baseline supervised models. In this\npaper, we first delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find that\nMAE tends to focus on low-level domain information during reconstructing pixels\nwhile changing the reconstruction target to token features could mitigate this\nproblem. However, not all features are beneficial, as we then find\nreconstructing high-level features can hardly improve the model's\ntransferability, indicating a trade-off between filtering domain information\nand preserving the image's global structure. In all, the reconstruction target\nmatters for the CDFSL task. Based on the above findings and interpretations, we\nfurther propose Domain-Agnostic Masked Image Modeling (DAMIM) for the CDFSL\ntask. DAMIM includes an Aggregated Feature Reconstruction module to\nautomatically aggregate features for reconstruction, with balanced learning of\ndomain-agnostic information and images' global structure, and a Lightweight\nDecoder module to further benefit the encoder's generalizability.

To address this issue, we\npropose a novel soft prompt learning method, named Mixture-of-Prompts\nDistillation (MoPD), which can effectively transfer useful knowledge from hard\nprompts manually hand-crafted (a.k.a. teacher prompts) to the learnable soft\nprompt (a.k.a. student prompt), thereby enhancing the generalization ability of\nsoft prompts on unseen classes.

The insights derived from\nthis study aim to enhance cybersecurity defense strategies, particularly when\ndealing with dynamic cyber threats that continually adapt their Tactics,\nTechniques, and Procedures (TTPs).

Our preliminary findings emphasize the critical need for cyber defenders\nto maintain a constant state of vigilance in updating their IoCs for any given\nvulnerability. This vigilance is warranted because the publication rate of IoCs\nmay exhibit fluctuations over time. We observe a recurring pattern akin to an\nepidemic model, with an initial phase following the public disclosure of a\nvulnerability characterized by sparse IoC publications, followed by a sudden\nsurge, and subsequently, a protracted period with a slower rate of IoC\npublication.",

This\npaper proposes a novel perspective for pre-trained model assessment through the\nDistribution of Spectral Components (DISCO). Through singular value\ndecomposition of features extracted from pre-trained models, we investigate\ndifferent spectral components and observe that they possess distinct\ntransferability, contributing diversely to the fine-tuning performance.\nInspired by this, we propose an assessment method based on the distribution of\nspectral components which measures the proportions of their corresponding\nsingular values. Pre-trained models with features concentrating on more\ntransferable components are regarded as better choices for transfer learning.\nWe further leverage the labels of downstream data to better estimate the\ntransferability of each spectral component and derive the final assessment\ncriterion. Our proposed method is flexible and can be applied to both\nclassification and regression tasks.

To this end, we propose a Service\nDependency Graph Generator (DGG) that comprises a Data Handler and a Graph\nGenerator, for generating the service dependency graphs of benchmarks that\nincorporate production-level characteristics from traces. The data handler\nfirst constructs fine-grained call graphs with dynamic interface and repeated\ncalling features from the trace and merges them into dependency graphs, and\nthen clusters them into different categories based on the topological and\ninvocation types. Taking the organized data and the selected category, the\ngraph generator simulates the process of real microservices invoking downstream\nmicroservices using a random graph model, generates multiple call graphs, and\nmerges the call graphs to form the small-scale service dependency graph with\nproduction-level characteristics.

To overcome the existing\nlimitation of CCNIM to linear problems, the convective velocity in the\nnonlinear convection term is approximated using two different approaches, both\ndemonstrating accuracy comparable to or better than traditional NIM for\nnonlinear Burgers problems. Unlike traditional NIM, which utilizes\nsurface-averaged variables as discrete unknowns, this innovative approach\nformulates the final expression of the numerical scheme using discrete unknowns\nrepresented by cell-centered (or node-averaged) variables. Using these cell\ncentroids, the proposed CCNIM approach presents several advantages compared to\ntraditional NIM. These include a simplified implementation process in terms of\nlocal coordinate systems, enhanced flexibility regarding the higher order of\naccuracy in time, straightforward formulation for higher-degree temporal\nderivatives, and offering a viable option for coupling with other physics. The\nmulti-dimensional time-dependent Burgers problems (propagating shock,\npropagation, and diffusion of an initial sinusoidal wave, shock-like formation)\nwith known analytical solutions are solved in order to validate the developed\nscheme. Furthermore, a detailed comparison between the proposed CCNIM approach\nand other traditional NIM schemes is conducted to demonstrate its\neffectiveness.

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces enhance wireless systems by reshaping\npropagation environments. However, dynamic metasurfaces (MSs) with numerous\nphase-shift elements incur undesired control and hardware costs. In contrast,\nstatic MSs (SMSs), configured with static phase shifts pre-designed for\nspecific communication demands, offer a cost-effective alternative by\neliminating element-wise tuning. Nevertheless, SMSs typically support a single\nbeam pattern with limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose a novel\nMovable Intelligent Surface (MIS) technology that enables dynamic beamforming\nwhile maintaining static phase shifts. Specifically, we design a MIS\narchitecture comprising two closely stacked transmissive MSs: a larger\nfixed-position MS 1 and a smaller movable MS 2. By differentially shifting MS\n2's position relative to MS 1, the MIS synthesizes distinct beam patterns.\nThen, we model the interaction between MS 2 and MS 1 using binary selection\nmatrices and padding vectors and formulate a new optimization problem that\njointly designs the MIS phase shifts and selects shifting positions for\nworst-case signal-to-noise ratio maximization. This position selection, equal\nto beam pattern scheduling, offers a new degree of freedom for RIS-aided\nsystems. To solve the intractable problem, we develop an efficient algorithm\nthat handles unit-modulus and binary constraints and employs manifold\noptimization methods. Finally, extensive validation results are provided. We\nimplement a MIS prototype and perform proof-of-concept experiments,\ndemonstrating the MIS's ability to synthesize desired beam patterns that\nachieve one-dimensional beam steering. Numerical results show that by\nintroducing MS 2 with a few elements, MIS effectively offers beamforming\nflexibility for significantly improved performance. We also draw insights into\nthe optimal MIS configuration and element allocation strategy.",

Typically, CG greedily selects one\ncolumn with the most negative reduced cost, which can be improved by adding\nmore columns at once. However, selecting all columns with negative reduced\ncosts would lead to the addition of redundant columns that do not improve the\nobjective value. Therefore, selecting the appropriate columns to add is still\nan open problem and previous machine-learning-based approaches for CG only add\na constant quantity of columns per iteration due to the state-space explosion\nproblem.

Nevertheless, effective domain adaptation that improves\ntransferability toward target domains remains unexplored. In this paper, we\ndelve into this topic and empirically discover that direct feature alignment on\npoint Transformer's CNN backbone only brings limited improvements since it\ncannot guarantee sequence-wise domain-invariant features in the Transformer. To\nthis end, we propose a pioneering Domain Adaptive Point Transformer (DAPoinTr)\nframework for point cloud completion. DAPoinTr consists of three key\ncomponents: Domain Query-based Feature Alignment (DQFA), Point Token-wise\nFeature alignment (PTFA), and Voted Prediction Consistency (VPC). In\nparticular, DQFA is presented to narrow the global domain gaps from the\nsequence via the presented domain proxy and domain query at the Transformer\nencoder and decoder, respectively. PTFA is proposed to close the local domain\nshifts by aligning the tokens, \\emph{i.e.,} point proxy and dynamic query, at\nthe Transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. VPC is designed to consider\ndifferent Transformer decoders as multiple of experts (MoE) for ensembled\nprediction voting and pseudo-label generation.

Our study reveals that disorders can induce\ndelocalization and enable the control of transmission through quantum geometry.\nIn the weak disorder regime, transmission is primarily mediated by\ninterface-bound states, whose localization length is determined by the quantum\ngeometry of the system. As disorder strength increases, a zero-energy\ntransmission channel - absent in the clean system - emerges, reaches a maximum,\nand then diminishes inversely with disorder strength in the strong disorder\nlimit. In the strong disorder regime, the transmission increases with the\nlocalization length and eventually saturates when the localization length\nbecomes comparable to the link size. Using the Born approximation, we attribute\nthis bulk transmission to a finite velocity induced by disorder scattering.\nFurthermore, by analyzing the Bethe-Salpeter equation for diffusion, we propose\nthat the quantum metric provides a characteristic length scale for diffusion in\nthese systems.

    "abstract": "To design type systems that use subtyping, we have to make tradeoffs. Deep\nsubtyping is more expressive than shallow subtyping, because deep subtyping\ncompares the entire structure of types. However, shallow subtyping is easier to\nreason about. By eta-expanding source programs, we can get the effect of deep\nsubtyping with less of its complexity. An early paper on filter models\n(Barendregt et al. 1983) examined two similar intersection type systems. The\nfirst included a subsumption rule that used a rich subtyping relation,\nincluding multiple rules for the top type and a distributivity rule. Their\nsecond type system dropped the subsumption rule, but added a rule that allowed\na term to be eta-expanded before typing it. This rule in their second type\nsystem compensated for the lack of subsumption: where their first type system\nused subtyping to manipulate intersections deep inside types, their second type\nsystem used introduction and elimination rules directly on the subterms created\nby eta-expansion. Viewed as a computation, their proof of completeness for the\nsecond (shallow) system performs eta-expansion. Thus, we can regard their proof\nas inventing the application of eta-expansion to avoid deep subtyping. This\npaper serves as a tutorial on using eta-expansion to obviate deep subtyping,\nputs the invention of the technique by Barendregt et al.

When applied to the\nRobertson-Walker metric, it simplifies the analysis of cosmological evolution\nby dividing the Einstein field equations into constraint and evolution\nequations. It introduces the lapse function $N$ and the shift vector $N^i$,\nwhich control how time and spatial coordinates evolve between hypersurfaces. In\nstandard model cosmology, $N = 1$ and $N^i = 0$ for the Robertson-Walker\nmetric.

This approach allows for a\nmore direct examination of the evolution of spatial geometry and offers\nflexibility in handling scenarios where the lapse function and shift vector\nvary. In this manuscript, we derive the model's $N$ and $N^i$, along with the\nconstraint and evolution equations, and demonstrate their consistency with the\nexisting Einstein equations. We have shown in a previous paper that the\npossibility of changes in the speed of light in the Robertson-Walker metric is\ndue to cosmological time dilation.

    "abstract": "Multilingual text-to-speech systems convert text into speech across multiple\nlanguages. In many cases, text sentences may contain segments in different\nlanguages, a phenomenon known as code-switching. This is particularly common in\nIndonesia, especially between Indonesian and English. Despite its significance,\nno research has yet developed a multilingual TTS system capable of handling\ncode-switching between these two languages. This study addresses\nIndonesian-English code-switching in STEN-TTS. Key modifications include adding\na language identification component to the text-to-phoneme conversion using\nfinetuned BERT for per-word language identification, as well as removing\nlanguage embedding from the base model. Experimental results demonstrate that\nthe code-switching model achieves superior naturalness and improved speech\nintelligibility compared to the Indonesian and English baseline STEN-TTS\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "A graph is $(t_1, t_2)$-Ramsey if any red-blue coloring of its edges contains\neither a red copy of $K_{t_1}$ or a blue copy of $K_{t_2}$. The size Ramsey\nnumber is the minimum number of edges contained in a $(t_1,t_2)$-Ramsey graph.\nGeneralizing the notion of size Ramsey numbers, the $F$-Ramsey number $r_F(t_1,\nt_2)$ is defined to be the minimum number of copies of $F$ in a\n$(t_1,t_2)$-Ramsey graph. It is easy to see that $r_{K_s}(t_1,t_2)\\le\n\\binom{r(t_1,t_2)}{s}$. Recently, Fox, Tidor, and Zhang showed that equality\nholds in this bound when $s=3$ and $t_1=t_2$, i.e. $r_{K_3}(t,t) =\n\\binom{r(t,t)}{3}$. They further conjectured that\n$r_{K_s}(t,t)=\\binom{r(t,t)}{s}$ for all $s\\le t$, in response to a question of\nSpiro.\n  In this work, we study the off-diagonal variant of this conjecture: is it\ntrue that $r_{K_s}(t_1,t_2)=\\binom{r(t_1,t_2)}{s}$ whenever $s\\le\n\\max(t_1,t_2)$? Harnessing the constructions used in the recent breakthrough\nwork of Mattheus and Verstra\\\"ete on the asymptotics of $r(4,t)$, we show that\nwhen $t_1$ is $3$ or $4$, the above equality holds up to a lower order term in\nthe exponent.",

While there has been previous research in the fields of psychometrics,\ninertial sensors, computer vision, and audio analysis, this paper introduces a\nnovel technique for identifying human traits in real time using brainwave data.\nTo achieve this, we begin with an extensive study of brainwave data collected\nfrom 80 participants using a portable EEG headset.

Our analysis\nuncovers several new insights, leading us to a groundbreaking unified approach\nfor identifying diverse human traits by leveraging machine learning techniques\non EEG data.

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks significantly compromise the security of large language\nmodels by triggering them to output specific and controlled content. Currently,\ntriggers for textual backdoor attacks fall into two categories: fixed-token\ntriggers and sentence-pattern triggers. However, the former are typically easy\nto identify and filter, while the latter, such as syntax and style, do not\napply to all original samples and may lead to semantic shifts. In this paper,\ninspired by cross-lingual (CL) prompts of LLMs in real-world scenarios, we\npropose a higher-dimensional trigger method at the paragraph level, namely\nCL-attack. CL-attack injects the backdoor by using texts with specific\nstructures that incorporate multiple languages, thereby offering greater\nstealthiness and universality compared to existing backdoor attack techniques.\nExtensive experiments on different tasks and model architectures demonstrate\nthat CL-attack can achieve nearly 100% attack success rate with a low poisoning\nrate in both classification and generation tasks. We also empirically show that\nthe CL-attack is more robust against current major defense methods compared to\nbaseline backdoor attacks. Additionally, to mitigate CL-attack, we further\ndevelop a new defense called TranslateDefense, which can partially mitigate the\nimpact of CL-attack.",

The BP region exploits the\ntree-reweighted BP, which offers improved convergence than the standard BP for\ngraphs with massive cycles, to resolve data association. The MF region\napproximates the posterior densities of the measurement rate, kinematic state\nand extent. For linear Gaussian target models and gamma Gaussian inverse\nWishart distributed state density, the unified approach provides a closed-form\nrecursion for the state density. Hence, the proposed algorithm is more\nefficient than particle-based BP algorithms for extended target tracking. This\nmethod also avoids measurement clustering and gating since it solves the data\nassociation problem in a probabilistic fashion.

    "abstract": "Optimal transport has numerous applications, particularly in machine learning\ntasks involving generative models. In practice, the transportation process\noften encounters an information bottleneck, typically arising from the\nconversion of a communication channel into a rate-limited bit pipeline using\nerror correction codes. While this conversion enables a channel-oblivious\napproach to optimal transport, it fails to fully exploit the available degrees\nof freedom. Motivated by the emerging paradigm of generative communication,\nthis paper examines the problem of channel-aware optimal transport, where a\nblock of i.i.d. random variables is transmitted through a memoryless channel to\ngenerate another block of i.i.d. random variables with a prescribed marginal\ndistribution such that the end-to-end distortion is minimized. With unlimited\ncommon randomness available to the encoder and decoder, the source-channel\nseparation architecture is shown to be asymptotically optimal as the\nblocklength approaches infinity. On the other hand, in the absence of common\nrandomness, the source-channel separation architecture is generally suboptimal.\nFor this scenario, a hybrid coding scheme is proposed, which partially retains\nthe generative capabilities of the given channel while enabling reliable\ntransmission of digital information. It is demonstrated that the proposed\nhybrid coding scheme can outperform both separation-based and uncoded schemes.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with balanced class accuracy in\ntext classification tasks using in-context learning (ICL), hindering some\npractical uses due to user dissatisfaction or safety risks caused by\nmisclassifications. Retraining LLMs to address root causes in data or model\npriors is neither easy nor cost-effective. This paper delves deeper into the\nclass accuracy imbalance issue, identifying that it arises because certain\nclasses consistently receive disproportionately high ICL probabilities, causing\nunder-prediction and lower accuracy for others. More importantly, probability\nranges affect the imbalance differently, allowing for precise, range-specific\ncorrections. We introduce FuRud (Fuzzy Rule Optimization-based Debiasing), a\nmethod for sample-level class probability correction. FuRud tackles\ninterpretability challenges by determining why certain classes need corrections\nand tailoring adjustments for each instance's class probabilities which is\npowered by fuzzy sets with triangular membership functions, transforming a\nclass probability based on the range it belongs to. By solving a nonlinear\ninteger programming problem with a labeled set of ICL class probabilities to\nminimize class accuracy bias (COBias) and maximize overall accuracy, each class\nselects an optimal correction function from 19 triangular membership functions\nwithout updating an LLM, and the selected functions correct test instances at\ninference.

    "abstract": "The classification of different patterns of network evolution, for example in\nbrain connectomes or social networks, is a key problem in network inference and\nmodern data science. Building on the notion of a network's Euclidean mirror,\nwhich captures its evolution as a curve in Euclidean space, we develop the\nDynamic Network Clustering through Mirror Distance (DNCMD), an algorithm for\nclustering dynamic networks based on a distance measure between their\nassociated mirrors. We provide theoretical guarantees for DNCMD to achieve\nexact recovery of distinct evolutionary patterns for latent position random\nnetworks both when underlying vertex features change deterministically and when\nthey follow a stochastic process. We validate our theoretical results through\nnumerical simulations and demonstrate the application of DNCMD to understand\nedge functions in Drosophila larval connectome data, as well as to analyze\ntemporal patterns in dynamic trade networks.",

    "abstract": "Existing facial editing methods have achieved remarkable results, yet they\noften fall short in supporting multimodal conditional local facial editing. One\nof the significant evidences is that their output image quality degrades\ndramatically after several iterations of incremental editing, as they do not\nsupport local editing. In this paper, we present a novel multimodal generative\nand fusion framework for globally-consistent local facial editing (FACEMUG)\nthat can handle a wide range of input modalities and enable fine-grained and\nsemantic manipulation while remaining unedited parts unchanged. Different\nmodalities, including sketches, semantic maps, color maps, exemplar images,\ntext, and attribute labels, are adept at conveying diverse conditioning\ndetails, and their combined synergy can provide more explicit guidance for the\nediting process. We thus integrate all modalities into a unified generative\nlatent space to enable multimodal local facial edits. Specifically, a novel\nmultimodal feature fusion mechanism is proposed by utilizing multimodal\naggregation and style fusion blocks to fuse facial priors and multimodalities\nin both latent and feature spaces. We further introduce a novel self-supervised\nlatent warping algorithm to rectify misaligned facial features, efficiently\ntransferring the pose of the edited image to the given latent codes. We\nevaluate our FACEMUG through extensive experiments and comparisons to\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results demonstrate the superiority of\nFACEMUG in terms of editing quality, flexibility, and semantic control, making\nit a promising solution for a wide range of local facial editing tasks.",

In this\nstudy, a new equiatomic HEA ZrHfNbTaW with an ultrahigh hardness of 860 Hv is\ndeveloped. The alloy is first synthesized with a dual-phase structure via arc\nmelting and further homogenized to a single body-centered cubic (BCC) structure\nby phase transformation via high-pressure torsion (HPT), using the concept of\nultra-severe plastic deformation process. The ultrahigh hardness of the alloy,\nwhich is higher than those reported for refractory alloys and single-phase\nHEAs, is attributed to (i) solution hardening by severe lattice distortion,\n(ii) Hall-Petch grain boundary hardening by the formation of nanograins with 12\nnm average size, and (iii) dislocation hardening confirmed by high-resolution\ntransmission electron microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Audiovisual Automatic Speech Recognition (AV-ASR) aims to improve speech\nrecognition accuracy by leveraging visual signals. It is particularly\nchallenging in unconstrained real-world scenarios across various domains due to\nnoisy acoustic environments, spontaneous speech, and the uncertain use of\nvisual information. Most previous works fine-tune audio-only ASR models on\naudiovisual datasets, optimizing them for conventional ASR objectives. However,\nthey often neglect visual features and common errors in unconstrained video\nscenarios. In this paper, we propose using a preference optimization strategy\nto improve speech recognition accuracy for real-world videos. First, we create\npreference data via simulating common errors that occurred in AV-ASR from two\nfocals: manipulating the audio or vision input and rewriting the output\ntranscript. Second, we propose BPO-AVASR, a Bifocal Preference Optimization\nmethod to improve AV-ASR models by leveraging both input-side and output-side\npreference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly\nimproves speech recognition accuracy across various domains, outperforming\nprevious state-of-the-art models on real-world video speech recognition.",

To address this, we extend the\nMahalanobis distance concept to Bayes spaces, proposing its regularized version\nthat accounts for the constraints inherent in density data. Based on this\nextension, we introduce a new method, robust density principal component\nanalysis (RDPCA), for more accurate estimation of functional principal\ncomponents in the presence of outliers.
