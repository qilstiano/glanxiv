Our quantum representation of color multi-image is based on\nspace-filling curves and allows to reduce the storage space. We generalize the\nquantum baker map, so that it may scramble two n-qudits. By doing so, we\nenlarge its parameter space exponentially, leading to a better security.

    "abstract": "Collecting pixel-level labels for medical datasets can be a laborious and\nexpensive process, and enhancing segmentation performance with a scarcity of\nlabeled data is a crucial challenge. This work introduces AugPaint, a data\naugmentation framework that utilizes inpainting to generate image-label pairs\nfrom limited labeled data. AugPaint leverages latent diffusion models, known\nfor their ability to generate high-quality in-domain images with low overhead,\nand adapts the sampling process for the inpainting task without need for\nretraining. Specifically, given a pair of image and label mask, we crop the\narea labeled with the foreground and condition on it during reversed denoising\nprocess for every noise level. Masked background area would gradually be filled\nin, and all generated images are paired with the label mask. This approach\nensures the accuracy of match between synthetic images and label masks, setting\nit apart from existing dataset generation methods. The generated images serve\nas valuable supervision for training downstream segmentation models,\neffectively addressing the challenge of limited annotations. We conducted\nextensive evaluations of our data augmentation method on four public medical\nimage segmentation datasets, including CT, MRI, and skin imaging. Results\nacross all datasets demonstrate that AugPaint outperforms state-of-the-art\nlabel-efficient methodologies, significantly improving segmentation\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Bias in predictive machine learning (ML) models is a fundamental challenge\ndue to the skewed or unfair outcomes produced by biased models. Existing\nmitigation strategies rely on either post-hoc corrections or rigid constraints.\nHowever, emerging research claims that these techniques can limit scalability\nand reduce generalizability. To address this, this paper introduces a\nfeature-wise mixing framework to mitigate contextual bias. This was done by\nredistributing feature representations across multiple contextual datasets. To\nassess feature-wise mixing's effectiveness, four ML classifiers were trained\nusing cross-validation and evaluated with bias-sensitive loss functions,\nincluding disparity metrics and mean squared error (MSE), which served as a\nstandard measure of predictive performance. The proposed method achieved an\naverage bias reduction of 43.35% and a statistically significant decrease in\nMSE across all classifiers trained on mixed datasets. Additionally,\nbenchmarking against established bias mitigation techniques found that\nfeature-wise mixing consistently outperformed SMOTE oversampling and\ndemonstrated competitive effectiveness without requiring explicit bias\nattribute identification. Feature-wise mixing efficiently avoids the\ncomputational overhead typically associated with fairness-aware learning\nalgorithms. Future work could explore applying feature-wise mixing for\nreal-world fields where accurate predictions are necessary.",

To address this, we\ninvestigate ternary language models (TriLMs) that employ quantization-aware\ntraining to significantly reduce memory requirements.

We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models\nthe PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be\nadded on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely\n(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we\ntake derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental\nprecision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even\nMLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above\nfloat64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,\nadding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable\naccuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully\ncharacterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it\nduring training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five\nbenchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for\nconvection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining\ncompatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an\nexplicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave\nproblems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the\nperformance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson\nproblems. Together, these findings point to a practical path for combining the\nflexibility of PINNs with the precision of classical spectral solvers.",

    "abstract": "Developing decision-making algorithms for highly automated driving systems\nremains challenging, since these systems have to operate safely in an open and\ncomplex environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches can learn\ncomprehensive decision policies directly from experience and already show\npromising results in simple driving tasks. However, current approaches fail to\nachieve generalizability for more complex driving tasks and lack learning\nefficiency. Therefore, we present Scenario-based Automated Driving\nReinforcement Learning (SAD-RL), the first framework that integrates\nReinforcement Learning (RL) of hierarchical policy in a scenario-based\nenvironment. A high-level policy selects maneuver templates that are evaluated\nand executed by a low-level control logic. The scenario-based environment\nallows to control the training experience for the agent and to explicitly\nintroduce challenging, but rate situations into the training process. Our\nexperiments show that an agent trained using the SAD-RL framework can achieve\nsafe behaviour in easy as well as challenging situations efficiently. Our\nablation studies confirmed that both HRL and scenario diversity are essential\nfor achieving these results.",

The plantation was established in 2017\nunder a high-density planting system (650 trees/ha). Permanent monitoring\ntechniques were applied in 16 one-hectare plots to analyze structural growth\nvariables, including survival rate, diameter at breast height (DBH), total\nheight, commercial height, basal area, volume, and mean annual increment (MAI).\nThe results show an average survival rate of 80.2%, with a mean DBH of 25.3 cm\nat five years, indicating sustained growth under favorable edaphoclimatic\nconditions. Volume was calculated using the equation V = G HT Ff, yielding\naverage values of 183.262 m3 for total volume and 166.19 m3 for commercial\nvolume. The estimated MAI for diameter and height was 5.06 cm/year and 3.61\nm/year, respectively, with values comparable to studies conducted in other\nEcuadorian sites, although lower productivity was observed in Esmeraldas,\nattributed to edaphic and climatic differences identified through soil type and\nenvironmental condition analyses. The research highlights the significant\ninfluence of edaphic conditions, silvicultural management, and environmental\nvariables on the performance of Gmelina arborea in tropical Ecuador. The\nfindings provide a foundation for optimizing forest management strategies and\nimproving growth indicators in commercial plantations, contributing to the\nsustainable development of forest resources in the region and strengthening\nsilvicultural planning based on predictive models tailored to local conditions.\nThis study represents a step forward in the scientific assessment of melina\ngrowth under Ecuadorian conditions, promoting more precise and sustainable\nsilvicultural practices",

To quantify this gap, we\nintroduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to\nwhich retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs.

However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the\nsafety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to\nuncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this\nwork, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk\nprediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing\nhigh-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based\nmotion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,\nother vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize\nplug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call\nDriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation\nframework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel\ninformation injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and\ntrajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial\nrelationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our\nDriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction\nperformance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy\nsoaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation\non an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a\nsignificant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to\n68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in\nreal-world scenarios.",

The results point to the distinct\nmodes of neural dynamics organization likely reflecting cumulative\ndevelopmental adaptations to sensory inputs that shape both resting-state\nneural activity and cognitive processing strategies.",

    "abstract": "The results of a search for the production of two scalar bosons in final\nstates with two photons and two tau leptons are presented. The search considers\nboth nonresonant production of a Higgs boson pair, HH, and resonant production\nvia a new boson X which decays either to HH or to H and a new scalar Y. The\nanalysis uses up to 138 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data, recorded\nbetween 2016 and 2018 by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass\nenergy of 13 TeV. No evidence for signal is found in the data. For the\nnonresonant production, the observed (expected) upper limit at 95% confidence\nlevel (CL) on the HH production cross section is set at 930 (740) fb,\ncorresponding to 33 (26) times the standard model prediction. At 95% CL, HH\nproduction is observed (expected) to be excluded for values of $\\kappa_\\lambda$\noutside the range between $-$12 ($-$9.4) and 17 (15). Observed (expected) upper\nlimits at 95% CL for the XHH cross section are found to be within 160 to 2200\n(200 to 1800) fb, depending on the mass of X. In the X $\\to$ Y($\\gamma\n\\gamma$)H($\\tau\\tau$) search, the observed (expected) upper limits on the\nproduct of the production cross section and decay branching fractions vary\nbetween 0.059$-$1.2 fb (0.087$-$0.68 fb).

Consequently, the second\nand higher-order terms of $\\tau$ appearing in the Taylor expansion of the HI\n21-cm differential brightness temperature ($\\delta T_{\\rm b}$ ) become\nimportant. This introduces additional non-Gaussianity into the signal. We study\nthe impact of large $\\tau$ on statistical quantities of HI 21-cm signal using a\nsuite of standard numerical simulations that vary X-ray heating efficiency and\nthe minimum halo mass required to host radiation sources. We find that the\nhigher order terms suppress statistical quantities such as skewness,\npower-spectrum and bispectrum. However, the effect is found to be particularly\nstrong on the non-Gaussian signal. We find that the change in skewness can\nreach several hundred percent in low X-ray heating scenarios. For moderate and\nhigh X-ray heating models changes are around $\\sim40\\%$ and $60\\%$,\nrespectively, for $M_{\\rm h,min}=10^{9}\\, {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$.

We identify a general condition for AMP with polynomial\nnon-linearities, in terms of a Bounded Composition Property (BCP) for their\nrepresenting tensors, to admit a state evolution that holds universally for\nmatrices with non-Gaussian entries. We then formalize a condition of\nBCP-approximability for Lipschitz AMP algorithms to enjoy a similar universal\nguarantee.

    "abstract": "The judiciary, as one of democracy's three pillars, is dealing with a rising\namount of legal issues, needing careful use of judicial resources. This\nresearch presents a complex framework that leverages Data Science\nmethodologies, notably Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) techniques, to improve the efficiency of analyzing Calcutta\nHigh Court verdicts. Our framework focuses on two key aspects: first, the\ncreation of a robust summarization mechanism that distills complex legal texts\ninto concise and coherent summaries; and second, the development of an\nintelligent system for retrieving similar cases, which will assist legal\nprofessionals in research and decision making. By fine-tuning the Pegasus model\nusing case head note summaries, we achieve significant improvements in the\nsummarization of legal cases. Our two-step summarizing technique preserves\ncrucial legal contexts, allowing for the production of a comprehensive vector\ndatabase for RAG. The RAG-powered framework efficiently retrieves similar cases\nin response to user queries, offering thorough overviews and summaries. This\ntechnique not only improves legal research efficiency, but it also helps legal\nprofessionals and students easily acquire and grasp key legal information,\nbenefiting the overall legal scenario.",

    "abstract": "The recent measurement of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) reveals a mild tension with observations\nof the cosmic microwave background (CMB) within the standard $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmological model. This discrepancy leads to a preference for a total neutrino\nmass that is lower than the minimum value inferred from neutrino oscillation\nexperiments. Alternatively, this tension can be eased within $\\Lambda$CDM by\nassuming a higher optical depth ($\\tau \\simeq 0.09$), but such a value\nconflicts with large-scale CMB polarization data. We point out that cosmic\nbirefringence, as suggested by recent Planck reanalyses, resolves this\ndiscrepancy if the birefringence angle varies significantly during\nreionization. Specifically, we consider the fact that the measured cosmic\nbirefringence angle $\\beta_0=0.34\\pm0.09\\,(1\\,\\sigma)\\,$deg has the phase\nambiguity, i.e., the measured rotation angle is described by\n$\\beta=\\beta_0+180n\\,$deg ($n\\in \\mathbb{Z}$). We show that cosmic\nbirefringence induced by axion-like particles with nonzero $n$ suppresses the\nreionization bump, allowing a higher $\\tau$ consistent with data. We provide a\nviable parameter space where the birefringence effect simultaneously accounts\nfor the low-$\\ell$ polarization spectra, the Planck $EB$ correlations, and the\nelevated value of $\\tau$, suggesting a key role for cosmic birefringence in\ncurrent cosmological tensions.",

    "abstract": "We show that a single strongly coupled gauge theory naturally gives rise to a\nunified description of the dark sector, simultaneously addressing the origin of\ndark energy at the meV scale and self-interacting dark matter at the TeV scale.\nBuilding on the density-responsive scalar field framework that resolves\ncosmological singularities and generates dark energy without fine-tuning, we\nshow that the same underlying SU(3) gauge theory with $N_f = 10$ flavors\npredicts complete dark matter phenomenology. The theory generates not only the\nrequired anomalous dimension $\\gamma \\approx 0.50\\pm0.05$ for the dark-energy\nmechanism, but also produces a composite particle spectrum featuring a\nTeV-scale dark matter candidate ($m_\\chi \\approx 600$~GeV) and a heavier scalar\nmeson. Remarkably, the mass ratio $m_{\\Phi_h}/m_\\chi \\approx 2$ naturally\nemerges from the dynamics of confinement, without any fine-tuning. This\nresonance condition, which initially appears as a coincidence, is revealed to\nbe a robust prediction of the gauge dynamics, completely resolving the\nlong-standing tension between achieving the correct relic abundance and solving\nsmall-scale structure problems through self-interactions. The framework makes\nsharp, testable predictions: a narrow scalar resonance at $\\sim 1.2$~TeV\naccessible at HL-LHC, dark matter self-interactions of $\\sigma_T/m \\sim\n1$~cm$^2$/g at dwarf galaxy velocities, and a stochastic gravitational wave\nbackground from the confinement phase transition. By deriving both dark energy\nand dark matter from a single microscopic theory, our work demonstrates how\n95\\% of the universe's energy content can emerge from one underlying\nstrongly-coupled gauge theory, providing a complete and predictive framework\nfor dark sector physics across 15 orders of magnitude in energy.",

MARBLE is\ncomposed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the\ncrafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and\nphysical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE --\nall the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0%\naccuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the\nrandom baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for\nexisting MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where\nMLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs.

As natural and human-induced disruptions\ncontinue to grow, wireless networks must be resilient.

Unlike robustness and reliability,\nresilience is based on the understanding that disruptions will inevitably\nhappen. Resilience, as elasticity, focuses on the ability to bounce back to\nfavorable states, while resilience as plasticity involves agents and networks\nthat can flexibly expand their states and hypotheses through real-time\nadaptation and reconfiguration. This situational awareness and active\npreparedness, adapting world models and counterfactually reasoning about\npotential system failures and the best responses, is a core aspect of\nresilience.

We present a comprehensive security analysis under\ncollective Gaussian attacks, considering both terrestrial free-space channels,\naccounting for humidity-induced absorption, and inter-satellite links,\nincorporating realistic intermodulation noise. Simulations show secret key\nrates (SKR) reaching ~72 bits per channel use in open-air conditions. While\nintermodulation noise imposes trade-offs, optimised modulation variance enables\nresilience and secure communication range. The maximum terrestrial quantum link\nextends up to 4.5 m due to atmospheric THz absorption, whereas inter-satellite\nlinks can support secure communication over distances exceeding 100 km, owing\nto minimal propagation channel losses in space. We evaluate the practical\nimplementation of our protocol using recently developed on-chip coherent THz\nsources based on superconducting Josephson junctions. These compact,\nvoltage-tunable emitters produce wideband coherent radiation, making them ideal\ncandidates for integration in scalable quantum networks.

To address this, we\npropose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over\nmulti-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive\nprototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype\ncalibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable\nvisual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive\nrepresentation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning\ntechniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these\ncalibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and\nuncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to\nlimited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental\nresults on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed\nFewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS\nand class-incremental setting.

    "abstract": "AI is flattening culture. Evaluations of \"culture\" are showing the myriad\nways in which large AI models are homogenizing language and culture, averaging\nout rich linguistic differences into generic expressions. I call this\nphenomenon \"softmaxing culture,'' and it is one of the fundamental challenges\nfacing AI evaluations today. Efforts to improve and strengthen evaluations of\nculture are central to the project of cultural alignment in large AI systems.\nThis position paper argues that machine learning (ML) and human-computer\ninteraction (HCI) approaches to evaluation are limited. I propose two key\nconceptual shifts. First, instead of asking \"what is culture?\" at the start of\nsystem evaluations, I propose beginning with the question: \"when is culture?\"\nSecond, while I acknowledge the philosophical claim that cultural universals\nexist, the challenge is not simply to describe them, but to situate them in\nrelation to their particulars. Taken together, these conceptual shifts invite\nevaluation approaches that move beyond technical requirements toward\nperspectives that are more responsive to the complexities of culture.",

While\nimage-language models (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) show strong open-set recognition,\nthey lack temporal modeling needed for video understanding. We propose\nActAlign, a truly zero-shot, training-free method that formulates video\nclassification as a sequence alignment problem, preserving the generalization\nstrength of pretrained image-language models. For each class, a large language\nmodel (LLM) generates an ordered sequence of sub-actions, which we align with\nvideo frames using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space.\nWithout any video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5%\naccuracy on ActionAtlas--the most diverse benchmark of fine-grained actions\nacross multiple sports--where human performance is only 61.6%. ActAlign\noutperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using 8x fewer\nparameters.

To reach these conclusions we introduce the forward\nfleet assignment operator and study its properties, proving that it is\ninvertible for 'bad' objectives of fleet controllers. We also discuss the\nchallenges of implementing myopic fleet routing in the real world and compare\nit to Stackelberg and Nash routing.

For incorrect submissions, we construct a\nfine-grained error taxonomy and then propose a targeted improvement framework\nby combining a multi-turn dialogue-based repair phase and an\ninformation-augmented regeneration phase. Results: Experimental results show\nthat only 5 out of 80 problems are fully accepted when using basic prompts. For\nthe unsolved problems, we construct the error taxonomy, including general\nerrors (such as design, boundary, condition, data type, syntax, and\ninput/output errors) and specialized errors (such as those in mathematical\nproblems, greedy algorithms, and graph theories). After applying our proposed\nimprovement strategies, we substantially increased the number of correct\nsolutions, with 46 out of 80 problems successfully accepted.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we employ two model-independent approaches, including redshift\nbinning method and polynomial interpolation method, to reconstruct dark energy\n(DE) equation of state (EoS) $w(z)$ and DE density function $f(z)$. Our\nanalysis incorporates data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)\ndata release 2, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors from Planck\n2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope data release 6, and three Type Ia\nsupernovae (SN) compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5). To ensure model\nindependence, we adopt three redshift binning schemes (n=3, 4, 5) and three\npolynomial interpolation schemes with the same number of nodes (n=3, 4, 5). Our\nmain conclusions are as follows: 1) After taking into account DESI data, there\nis a clear trend that DE should evolve with redshift (with deviations from the\ncosmological constant reaching at least a $2.13\\sigma$ confidence level),\nindicating that current observations favor a dynamical DE. 2) In the redshift\nrange $0.5 < z < 1.5$, the DE EoS w(z) exhibits a decreasing trend and crosses\nthe phantom divide $w=-1$, suggesting quintom-like behavior. 3) The DE density\nf(z) first increases at low redshift, reaching a hump around $z\\approx 0.5$,\nand then decreases at $0.5 < z < 1.5$, with a rapid decrease at $z>1.0$. 4) For\n$z > 1.5$, current data are insufficient to place strong constraints on the\nevolution of DE, resulting in large uncertainties in the DE reconstruction. It\nmust be emphasized that, these four main conclusions are independent of\nspecific reconstruction models, and are insensitive to the choice of SN\ncompilations.",

    "abstract": "Understanding brain dynamics through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(fMRI) remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience, particularly in\ncapturing how the brain transitions between various functional states.\nRecently, metastability, which refers to temporarily stable brain states, has\noffered a promising paradigm to quantify complex brain signals into\ninterpretable, discretized representations. In particular, compared to\ncluster-based machine learning approaches, tokenization approaches leveraging\nvector quantization have shown promise in representation learning with powerful\nreconstruction and predictive capabilities. However, most existing methods\nignore brain transition dependencies and lack a quantification of brain\ndynamics into representative and stable embeddings. In this study, we propose a\nHierarchical State space-based Tokenization network, termed HST, which\nquantizes brain states and transitions in a hierarchical structure based on a\nstate space-based model. We introduce a refined clustered Vector-Quantization\nVariational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) that incorporates quantization error feedback\nand clustering to improve quantization performance while facilitating\nmetastability with representative and stable token representations. We validate\nour HST on two public fMRI datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in\nquantifying the hierarchical dynamics of the brain and its potential in disease\ndiagnosis and reconstruction performance.

The aim of this\npaper is to study how the popularity of a research topic is associated with the\nstructure of that topic's collaboration network, as observed by a suite of\nmeasures capturing organizational structure at several scales. We apply these\nmeasures to 1,938 algorithmically discovered topics across 121,391 papers\nsourced from arXiv metadata during the period 2020--2025. Our analysis, which\ncontrols for the confounding effects of network size, reveals a structural\ndichotomy--we find that popular topics organize into modular \"schools of\nthought,\" while niche topics maintain hierarchical core-periphery structures\ncentered around established experts. This divide is not an artifact of scale,\nbut represents a size-independent structural pattern correlated with\npopularity. We also document a \"constraint reversal\": after controlling for\nsize, researchers in popular fields face greater structural constraints on\ncollaboration opportunities, contrary to conventional expectations. Our\nfindings suggest that topic selection is an implicit choice between two\nfundamentally different collaborative environments, each with distinct\nimplications for a researcher's career.

It displays a negative long-term\neffective braking index $n' = -1.234(9)$ and roughly constant positive\nfrequency second derivatives extending all the way from one glitch to the next.\nWe use the published RXTE and NICER timing data (i) to explore whether\n`persistent shifts' (non-relaxing parts of the glitch $\\Delta\\dot{\\nu}$ in the\nspin-down rate, like those observed in the Crab pulsar) can explain the\nnegative effective braking index; (ii) to ascribe part of the inter-glitch\nrelaxation at constant frequency second derivative $\\ddot{\\nu}$ to internal\ntorques due to the coupling between the observed surface and the interior of\nthe neutron star like deduced for the Vela pulsar; (iii) to demonstrate, as a\nproof of concept, that after taking account of the persistent shifts and\ninternal torques, the true braking index $n$ associated with the pulsar braking\ntorque is $n\\sim 3 $, and (iv) to explore various empirical or model dependent\ncorrelations between glitch parameters and the time to the next glitch. The\naverage persistent shift derived for PSR J0537$-$6910 is in agreement with the\npersistent shift values for the Crab pulsar.

The resulting implementation provides a general-purpose\ndifferentiable ambiguity function compatible with modern automatic\ndifferentiation frameworks, enabling new research directions including neural\nnetwork-based waveform generation with ambiguity constraints, end-to-end\noptimization of radar systems, and integration of classical radar theory with\nmodern deep learning.

To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal\nSearch, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal\nregions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key\nobservation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal\nintervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through\ntwo main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is\nlikely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of\nframes from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model\nto produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,\nkeyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval\nperception throughout the video.

    "abstract": "While deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) demonstrate superior performance,\ntheir deployment on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware still remains\nchallenging. Network pruning offers a viable solution by reducing both\nparameters and synaptic operations (SynOps) to facilitate the edge deployment\nof SNNs, among which search-based pruning methods search for the SNNs structure\nafter pruning. However, existing search-based methods fail to directly use\nSynOps as the constraint because it will dynamically change in the searching\nprocess, resulting in the final searched network violating the expected SynOps\ntarget. In this paper, we introduce a novel SNN pruning framework called SPEAR,\nwhich leverages reinforcement learning (RL) technique to directly use SynOps as\nthe searching constraint. To avoid the violation of SynOps requirements, we\nfirst propose a SynOps prediction mechanism called LRE to accurately predict\nthe final SynOps after search. Observing SynOps cannot be explicitly calculated\nand added to constrain the action in RL, we propose a novel reward called TAR\nto stabilize the searching. Extensive experiments show that our SPEAR framework\ncan effectively compress SNN under specific SynOps constraint.",

However, confidence sequences built from informative priors are\nvulnerable to misspecification and may become vacuous when the prior is poorly\nchosen. We study this trade-off for Gaussian observations with known variance.\nBy combining the method of mixtures with a global informative prior whose tails\nare polynomial or exponential and the extended Ville's inequality, we construct\nconfidence sequences that are sharper than their non-informative counterparts\nwhenever the prior is well specified, yet remain bounded under arbitrary\nmisspecification.

A\nnetwork-based manufacturing system model is developed to capture complex\nmaterial flows, batch processing, and capacities of buffers and machines.

We propose Hecto, a lightweight MoE\narchitecture that leverages architectural heterogeneity by combining a GRU\nexpert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a\nsparse Top-1 gating mechanism. Evaluated on three reasoning benchmarks (AG\nNews, SST-2, HotpotQA) and a regression task (STS-B), Hecto matches or closely\ntrails homogeneous baselines in performance despite receiving isolated input\nrepresentations, while achieving clear expert specialization, with each expert\naligning to distinct reasoning types (temporal vs static). At larger batch\nsizes, Hecto exhibits improved performance, benefiting from relaxed\ncomputational constraints that allow its heterogeneous architecture to optimize\nmore effectively. Ablation results isolate architectural diversity as the\nsource of Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning\ntasks.

Existing learning-based approaches often rely on\ndiscretization of outcome spaces to ensure truthfulness, which leads to\ninefficiency with increasing problem size. To address this limitation, we\nformalize the concept of pricing rules, defined as functions that map outcomes\nto prices. Based on this concept, we propose a novel menu mechanism, which can\nbe equivalent to a truthful direct mechanism under specific conditions. The\ncore idea of TEDI lies in its parameterization of pricing rules using Partial\nGroupMax Network, a new network architecture designed to universally\napproximate partial convex functions. To learn optimal pricing rules, we\ndevelop novel training techniques, including covariance trick and continuous\nsampling, to derive unbiased gradient estimators compatible with first-order\noptimization. Theoretical analysis establishes that TEDI guarantees\ntruthfulness, full expressiveness, and dimension-insensitivity. Experimental\nevaluation in the studied auction setting demonstrates that TEDI achieves\nstrong performance, competitive with or exceeding state-of-the-art methods.\n  This work presents the first approaches to learn truthful mechanisms without\noutcome discretization, thereby enhancing algorithmic efficiency.

Unlike p-values, which express\ntail probabilities, $s$-values measure the number of semi-tail units into a\ndistribution's tail, where each unit represents a halving of the tail area.\nThis logarithmic scale provides intuitive interpretation: $s=3.3$ corresponds\nto the 10th percentile, $s=4.3$ to the 5th percentile, and $s=5.3$ to the 2.5th\npercentile. For two-tailed tests, $\\zeta$-values extend this concept\nsymmetrically around the median.\n  We demonstrate how these measures unify the interpretation of all test\nstatistics on a common scale, eliminating the need for distribution-specific\ntables. The approach offers practical advantages: critical values follow simple\narithmetic progressions, combining evidence from independent studies reduces to\nthe addition of $s$-values, and semi-tail units provide the natural scale for\nexpressing Bahadur slopes. This leads to a new asymptotic efficiency measure\nbased on differences rather than ratios of slopes, where a difference of 0.15\nsemi-tail units means that the more efficient test moves samples 10\\% farther\ninto the tail. Through examples ranging from standardized test scores to poker\nhand rankings, we show how semi-tail units provide a natural and interpretable\nscale for quantifying extremeness in any ordered distribution.",

    "abstract": "Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique\nthat adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of\nparameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover\n``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch\nembeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's\nself-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key\nand query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution,\nrespectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for\nlearning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data,\nde-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before\nlearning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch\nembeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt\nto be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly\naccelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on\nthe CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the\nbilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact,\nlow-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields\nthe final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT).\nExtensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT\nmethods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count\nand computation overhead.",

As a consequence of\nradiation-pressure dominance, the density in a standard thin disc (SSD)\ndecreases with the increase of accretion rates, making the innermost region\neffectively optically thin. Further increase in accretion rate leads to a rise\nof the temperature so that the Compton cooling is able to balance the accretion\nreleased energy. We demonstrate that the effectively optically thin flow is\ncharacterized by moderate temperature and large scattering optical depth,\nproducing a multi-color Wien spectrum. For an appropriate accretion rate, the\naccretion flow transforms from an outer SSD to an inner effectively optically\nthin flow. Thus, the spectra of the whole accretion flow exhibit two\ncomponents, i.e., a multi-color Wien spectrum at higher frequency and a\nmulti-color blackbody, the former could provide an alternative origin of soft\nX-ray excess or formation of warm corona in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our\nstability analysis proves it is thermally stable and viscously unstable,\nindicating its existence in accreting systems. We show that effectively\noptically thin accretion flow exists in supermassive black holes for accretion\nrates around 0.1 to 10 times Eddington value, bridging the SSD at low accretion\nrates and slim disc at high rates.

NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including\nself-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and\nspontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and\nmorphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This\nlimitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow\nquadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information\nwhich impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands\nof real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this\nlimitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by\nrecent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on\na coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary\nresolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and\ntexture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with\nminimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture\nand loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and\nperformance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD\noutputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent\nproperties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,\ninference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the\napplicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,\nand 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and\nmorphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed\nframework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal\ncomputational overhead.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous drifting is a complex and crucial maneuver for safety-critical\nscenarios like slippery roads and emergency collision avoidance, requiring\nprecise motion planning and control. Traditional motion planning methods often\nstruggle with the high instability and unpredictability of drifting,\nparticularly when operating at high speeds. Recent learning-based approaches\nhave attempted to tackle this issue but often rely on expert knowledge or have\nlimited exploration capabilities. Additionally, they do not effectively address\nsafety concerns during learning and deployment. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a novel Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based motion planner for\nautonomous drifting. Our approach integrates an RL agent with model-based drift\ndynamics to determine desired drift motion states, while incorporating a\nPredictive Safety Filter (PSF) that adjusts the agent's actions online to\nprevent unsafe states. This ensures safe and efficient learning, and stable\ndrift operation. We validate the effectiveness of our method through\nsimulations on a Matlab-Carsim platform, demonstrating significant improvements\nin drift performance, reduced tracking errors, and computational efficiency\ncompared to traditional methods. This strategy promises to extend the\ncapabilities of autonomous vehicles in safety-critical maneuvers.",

    "abstract": "Estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) using observational data\nis often challenged by nonignorable missing covariates arsing from informative\nmonitoring of patients in clinical practice. To address nonignorable\nmissingness of pseudo-outcomes induced by nonignorable missing covariates, a\nweighted Q-learning approach using parametric Q-function models and a\nsemiparametric missingness propensity model has recently been proposed.\nHowever, misspecification of parametric Q-functions at later stages of a DTR\ncan propagate estimation errors to earlier stages via the pseudo-outcomes\nthemselves and indirectly through biased estimation of the missingness\npropensity of the pseudo-outcomes. This robustness concern motivates us to\ndevelop a direct-search-based optimal DTR estimator built on a robust and\nefficient value estimator, where nonparametric methods are employed for\ntreatment propensity and Q-function estimation, and inverse probability\nweighting is applied using missingness propensity estimated with the aid of\nnonresponse instrumental variables. Specifically, in our value estimator, we\nreplace weights estimated by prediction models of treatment propensity with\nstable weights estimated by balancing covariate functions in a\nreproducing-kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Augmented by Q-functions estimated by\nRKHS-based smoothing splines, our value estimator mitigates the\nmisspecification risk of the weighted Q-learning approach while maintaining the\nefficiency gain from employing pseudo-outcomes in missing data scenarios. The\nasymptotic properties of the proposed estimator are derived, and simulations\ndemonstrate its superior performance over weighted Q-learning under model\nmisspecification. We apply the proposed methods to investigate the optimal\nfluid strategy for sepsis patients using data from the MIMIC database.",

The results reveal distinct inclination-dependence of\nlensed regions on different semi-disks: as inclination increases, the lensed\nregion contracts for the counter-side semi-disk while expanding for the co-side\none. Furthermore, through explicit specification of the emission profiles of\nthe three models, we present optical images for both optically thin and thick\ndisk scenarios at different inclinations.

To address this critical issue, we propose a\nunified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-uniGuard,\nwhich is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to\naccurately detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network.\nOur key idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict\nagainst an ego agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop\na probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a\nsubset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior\nprobabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative\nconsistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)\nsegmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its\ncollaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In\naddition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to\ndynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the\nreliability of the systems in dynamic environments.

In this work, we introduce a semantic informativeness\nmetric for an image calculated from text samples via a contrastive learning\nmodel; similarly, the informativeness of a text is calculated from image\nsamples. We propose a redefinition of the concept of Information Gain, a\nconcept previously explored in natural language processing, extending its\napplication to the domains of vision and language. Our metric quantifies how\nconditioning on an image distorts the distribution of associated texts, and\nvice versa for text conditioning on image distributions. In OpenCLIP's\nempirical results, we observe that images with the lowest Information Gain\nscores often correspond to placeholder icons such as \"image not found.\"\nFurthermore, we propose to measure a norm-based metric of the embedding to\nestimate the Information Gain, following the theoretical results for Skip-Gram\nwith Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding. Information Gain can be measured\nusing either CLIP or SigLIP, and the results demonstrate a strong correlation\nwith a coefficient of determination ranging from 0.98 to 1.00. After obtaining\nthe mean and the covariance of the sample embedding, the computational cost of\nthis method is independent of the sample size, and it is compatible with\npublicly available, open-weight models.",

Specifically, first, we devise a\npre-training paradigm that converts textual ground-truth labels into\npoint-level prompts while generating corresponding text masks.

Next, we employ linear projection to disentangle hidden\nstates that generated by a large language model into distinct textual and\nvisual feature subspaces. Finally, a dynamic mask fusion strategy\nsynergistically combines these decoupled features through triple supervision\nfrom predicted text/visual masks and ground-truth annotations.

Using the Rabbit-Duck illusion, we illustrate how\nperspective-dependent readings of agent behavior can create epistemic\ninstability. To address this, we introduce the Misalignment Mosaic, a\ndiagnostic framework for diagnosing meaning-level misalignment in MAS. It\ncomprises four components: 1. Terminological Inconsistency, 2.

The Mosaic\nenables researchers to examine how misalignment arises not only through policy\nor reward structures but also through language, framing, and design\nassumptions. While this paper focuses on the specific ambiguity between\ncoordination and cooperation, the Mosaic generalizes to other overloaded\nconcepts in MAS, such as alignment, autonomy, and trust. Rather than define\ncooperation once and for all, we offer a framework to diagnose meaning itself\nas a source of misalignment.",

With extensive experiments on various model\narchitectures, ranging from small models ($1 - 6$ million parameters) to a\nlarge model (more than $100$ million parameters) and using three different data\nsets, e.g., chest X-Ray, PASCAL-VOC, and CIFAR-100, we demonstrate that P$^2$U\nconsistently achieves better tradeoff between accuracy, bandwidth usage and\nlatency.

    "abstract": "Surface defect detection plays a critical role in industrial quality\ninspection. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly\nenhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional\nsemantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale\nannotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect\ndetection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic\nsegmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class\nactivation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of\nexisting CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient\ndetail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP),\nwhich refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas\nwith higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a\nregion-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally,\npseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance\niteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively\nbridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect\nsegmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial\nscenarios.",

We\ndevelop a tailored dataset Reason1K with only 1,000 carefully curated reasoning\ntraces emphasizing difficulty, diversity, and quality.

Our transfer learning approach incorporates: (1) a\nhierarchical distillation process capturing both strategic abstraction and\ntactical implementation patterns, (2) a sparse reasoning-focused adapter\narchitecture requiring only 0.3% additional trainable parameters, and (3) a\ntest-time compute scaling mechanism using guided inference interventions.\nComprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ReasonBridge improves reasoning\ncapabilities in open-source models by up to 23% on benchmark tasks,\nsignificantly narrowing the gap with closed-source models.

Clustering\nmultivariate time series (MTS) data like EEGs is important for understanding\nbrain functions but challenging due to complex non-stationary\ncross-dependencies, gradual transitions between cognitive states, noisy\nmeasurements, and ambiguous cluster boundaries. To address these issues, we\ndevelop a robust fuzzy clustering framework in the spectral domain. Our method\nleverages Kendall's tau-based canonical coherence, which extracts meaningful\nfrequency-specific monotonic relationships between groups of channels or\nregions. KenCoh effectively captures dominant coherence structures while\nremaining robust against outliers and noise, making it suitable for real EEG\ndatasets that typically contain artifacts. Our method first projects each MTS\nobject onto vectors derived from the KenCoh estimates (i.e, canonical\ndirections), which capture relevant information on the connectivity structure\nof oscillatory signals in predefined frequency bands. These spectral features\nare utilized to determine clusters of epochs using a fuzzy partitioning\nstrategy, accommodating gradual transitions and overlapping class structure.\nLastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to EEG data where\nlatent cognitive states such as alertness and drowsiness exhibit\nfrequency-specific dynamics and ambiguity. Our method captures both spectral\nand spatial features by locating the frequency-dependent structure and brain\nfunctional connectivity.

Its recent discovery was in part\nmotivated by the research of compensated magnets towards highly scalable\nspintronic technologies. Simultaneously, altermagnetism shares the anisotropic\nhigher-partial-wave nature of ordering with unconventional superfluid phases\nwhich have been at the forefront of research for the past several decades.\nThese examples illustrate the interest in altermagnetism from a broad range of\nscience and technology perspectives. After summarizing the diverse research\ncontext, we turn the focus of this review to the symmetry, microscopy and\nspectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism. We start from the description of\nspontaneously broken and retained symmetries which delineate the compensated\naltermagnetic ordering as a distinct magnetic phase. Next we focus on\nmicroscopic signatures and ordering mechanism of the altermagnetic phase. We\nhighlight crystal-structure realizations of a characteristic ferroic order of\nanisotropic higher-partial-wave components of atomic-scale spin densities in\naltermagnets, ranging from weakly-interacting metals to strongly correlated\ninsulators. The symmetry and microscopy signatures of altermagnetism are\ndirectly reflected in spin-dependent electronic spectra and responses. We\nreview salient band-structure features originating from the altermagnetic\nordering, and from its interplay with spin-orbit coupling and topological\nphenomena. Throughout the review we compare altermagnetism to traditional\nferromagnetism and Neel antiferromagntism, and to the currently intensely\nexplored magnetic phases with non-collinear symmetry-protected compensated spin\norders.

Such a result\nwas proven originally by [Demaine & Hajiaghayi, Combinatorica, 2008], where $f$\nwas indeed linear in $k$. However the dependency in $t$ in this result was\nnon-explicit (and huge).

Wood recently asked whether $f$ can be pushed further to be\npolynomial, while maintaining the linearity on $k$.

Wendland RBFs,\nknown for their compact support, smoothness, and positive definiteness in\napproximation theory, are adapted to address limitations of traditional\nactivation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. The proposed enhanced\nWendland activation combines a standard Wendland component with linear and\nexponential terms, offering tunable locality, improved gradient propagation,\nand enhanced stability during training. Theoretical analysis highlights its\nmathematical properties, including smoothness and adaptability, while empirical\nexperiments on synthetic tasks (e.g., sine wave approximation) and benchmark\ndatasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate competitive performance. Results\nshow that the Wendland-based activation achieves superior accuracy in certain\nscenarios, particularly in regression tasks, while maintaining computational\nefficiency. The study bridges classical RBF theory with modern deep learning,\nsuggesting that Wendland activations can mitigate overfitting and improve\ngeneralization through localized, smooth transformations. Future directions\ninclude hybrid architectures and domain-specific adaptations.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems.\nDespite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive\nscenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)\nand agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs\nwith knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly\nimplemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved\nknowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge\neffectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do\nsuch generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to\nfinetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific\ndata, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called\nknowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2\ndataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive\nknowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT\ntechniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show\nthat KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems,\nparticularly in terms of factual accuracy.

This\narchitecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless\ncompression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear\nmemory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to\nTransformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM\nfor anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the\nfirst anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM\narchitecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder\nprocesses input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is\ndevised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach,\nthe decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the\nreconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded\ncounterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions:\nMean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider\nlocal reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We\nevaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17\nreal-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR.\nIn our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23\npopular anomaly detection baselines.

To tackle this fine-grained task, most\nexisting methods focus on extracting regional features to enrich attribute\ninformation. However, a regional feature is typically used to predict a fixed\nset of pre-defined attributes in these methods, which limits the performance\nand practicality in two aspects: 1) Regional features may compromise\nfine-grained patterns unique to certain attributes in favor of capturing common\ncharacteristics shared across attributes. 2) Regional features cannot\ngeneralize to predict unseen attributes in the test time. In this paper, we\npropose the \\textbf{F}ine-grained \\textbf{O}ptimization with semanti\\textbf{C}\ng\\textbf{U}ided under\\textbf{S}tanding (FOCUS) approach for PAR, which\nadaptively extracts fine-grained attribute-level features for each attribute\nindividually, regardless of whether the attributes are seen or not during\ntraining. Specifically, we propose the Multi-Granularity Mix Tokens (MGMT) to\ncapture latent features at varying levels of visual granularity, thereby\nenriching the diversity of the extracted information. Next, we introduce the\nAttribute-guided Visual Feature Extraction (AVFE) module, which leverages\ntextual attributes as queries to retrieve their corresponding visual attribute\nfeatures from the Mix Tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. To ensure that\ntextual attributes focus on the appropriate Mix Tokens, we further incorporate\na Region-Aware Contrastive Learning (RACL) method, encouraging attributes\nwithin the same region to share consistent attention maps.

    "abstract": "Despite multiple view consistency offered by 3D-aware GAN techniques, the\nresulting images often lack the capacity for localized editing. In response,\ngenerative radiance manifolds emerge as an efficient approach for constrained\npoint sampling within volumes, effectively reducing computational demands and\nenabling the learning of fine details. This work introduces SemFaceEdit, a\nnovel method that streamlines the appearance and geometric editing process by\ngenerating semantic fields on generative radiance manifolds. Utilizing latent\ncodes, our method effectively disentangles the geometry and appearance\nassociated with different facial semantics within the generated image. In\ncontrast to existing methods that can change the appearance of the entire\nradiance field, our method enables the precise editing of particular facial\nsemantics while preserving the integrity of other regions. Our network\ncomprises two key modules: the Geometry module, which generates semantic\nradiance and occupancy fields, and the Appearance module, which is responsible\nfor predicting RGB radiance. We jointly train both modules in adversarial\nsettings to learn semantic-aware geometry and appearance descriptors. The\nappearance descriptors are then conditioned on their respective semantic latent\ncodes by the Appearance Module, facilitating disentanglement and enhanced\ncontrol. Our experiments highlight SemFaceEdit's superior performance in\nsemantic field-based editing, particularly in achieving improved radiance field\ndisentanglement.",

While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure\nmode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning\ntrace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model\n(\"listener\") evaluating the same output.

By sweeping\n(gamma, p) over a two-dimensional grid and performing repeated stochastic\ntrials, we map out the average fidelity and average yield surfaces of the\npurified output, as well as the net gains (DF) and losses (DY) relative to the\nunpurified baseline.

    "abstract": "The handling of manifold-valued data, for instance, plays a central role in\ncolor restoration tasks relying on circle- or sphere-valued color models, in\nthe study of rotational or directional information related to the special\northogonal group, and in Gaussian image processing, where the pixel statistics\nare interpreted as values on the hyperbolic sheet. Especially, to denoise these\nkind of data, there have been proposed several generalizations of total\nvariation (TV) and Tikhonov-type denoising models incorporating the underlying\nmanifolds. Recently, a novel, numerically efficient denoising approach has been\nintroduced, where the data are embedded in an Euclidean ambient space, the\nnon-convex manifolds are encoded by a series of positive semi-definite,\nfixed-rank matrices, and the rank constraint is relaxed to obtain a\nconvexification that can be solved using standard algorithms from convex\nanalysis. The aim of the present paper is to extent this approach to new kinds\nof data like multi-binary and Stiefel-valued data. Multi-binary data can, for\ninstance, be used to model multi-color QR codes whereas Stiefel-valued data\noccur in image and video-based recognition. For both new data types, we propose\nTV- and Tikhonov-based denoising modelstogether with easy-to-solve\nconvexification.

While significant research has\nfocused on secure communications, particularly in ensuring physical layer\nsecurity, the issue of sensing security has received comparatively less\nattention. This paper addresses the sensing security problem in ISAC,\nparticularly under the threat of multi-intercept adversaries. We consider a\nrealistic scenario in which the sensing target is an advanced electronic\nreconnaissance aircraft capable of employing multiple signal interception\ntechniques, such as power detection (PD) and cyclostationary analysis (CA). To\nevaluate sensing security under such sophisticated threats, we analyze two\ncritical features of the transmitted signal: (i) power distribution and (ii)\ncyclic spectrum. Further, we introduce a novel ergodic cyclic spectrum metric\nwhich leverages the intrinsic mathematical structure of cyclostationary signals\nto more comprehensively characterize their behavior. Building on this analysis,\nwe formulate a new ISAC design problem that explicitly considers sensing\nsecurity, and we develop a low-complexity, efficient optimization approach to\nsolve it. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed metric is both\neffective and insightful, and that our ISAC design significantly enhances\nsensing security performance in the presence of multi-intercept threats.",

A machine learning framework is developed to accelerate the\nparameterization of interatomic force fields (FFs), enabling molecular dynamics\nsimulations of three nanocrystalline models: (i) a meta-atom (MA) mode\nrepresenting the RHEA as a hypothetical sing-element system with averaged\nproperties, (ii) a quinary RSS model with randomly distributed constituent\natoms, and (iii) a Monte Carlo (MC) model with internal CSRO. The results\nreveal that RSS enhances strength, while CSRO reduces flow stress level but\nimproves strain hardening and failure resistance. A transition from Hall-Petch\n(HP) strengthening to inverse Hall-Petch (IHP) softening is observed, with CSRO\nsuppressing this transition. The underlying plastic mechanisms (i.e.,\ndislocation slip, deformation twinning, phase transformation and grain boundary\nmovements) are analyzed from both nanostructural and energetic perspectives.\nTheoretical models are established to describe the size-dependent yield\nstrength and predict the critical grain size.

To overcome this\narchitectural bottleneck, this paper proposes the timely design perspective of\n\"Memory as a Service\" (MaaS). MaaS advocates decoupling memory from its\nconventional role as an interaction byproduct and encapsulating it as a modular\nservice that can be independently callable, dynamically composable, and finely\ngoverned. At its core, MaaS leverages the duality of memory-its inherently\nprivate nature and its potential for public service-to grant memory controlled,\non-demand interoperability across entities.

Using simulations, we find that few regions of the derived\nCMB sky are still contaminated and have to be omitted. Based on this study, we\nderived a mask that could be used in conjugation with the standard mask to\nfurther improve the purpose of galactic masks.",

Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting\ntarget concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with\nminimal distortion.

In this work,\nwe first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion\nmodels, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \\emph{linear} modules to\nweights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we\npropose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding\n\\emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or\ncut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad\ndistributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the\nforgetting.

Extensive experiments on the erasure of\ncelebrities, artistic styles, and explicit contents demonstrated that the\nproposed CPE outperforms prior arts by keeping diverse remaining concepts while\ndeleting the target concepts with robustness against attack prompts.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel channel knowledge map (CKM)-assisted\ndual-domain tracking and predictive beamforming scheme for high-mobility\nwireless networks. The central premise is that the CKM integrates both the\ncoordinate and beam domains, thereby enabling tracking in one domain via\ntreating the other domain's input as priors or measurements. In the coordinate\ndomain (C-Domain), an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to predict and\ntrack the state (i.e., location and velocity) of a moving communication\nreceiver across time slots under both line-of-sight (LoS)-present and\nLoS-absent conditions, where the CKM provides a prior mapping from multipath\nchannel parameters to potential target locations. In the beam domain\n(B-Domain), the updated location of the receiver is fed back to CKM to offer a\npriori information of angle of arrival (AoA) variations, which are incorporated\nto establish beam transition models for effective beam tracking, depending on\nthe angular variation situation of each path. Then, we analyze the Cram\\'er-Rao\nBound (CRB) for AoA estimation for each path in the considered system and\npropose a jointly predictive beamforming and power allocation design to\nminimize AoA estimation errors, directly enhancing multipath beam tracking\naccuracy and indirectly improving target tracking performance. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvements\nin both target and beam tracking performance compared to the state-of-the-art\napproaches, particularly in AoA tracking of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths,\nhighlighting the potential gain of CKM in facilitating both target and beam\ntracking in high-mobility communications.",

In this paper, we concern\nourselves with the very first peculiarities seen in CMB data viz., a breakdown\nof statistical isotropy in the form of axiality and planarity of these low-$l$\nmodes, and preferred alignments among them. We scrutinize the latest CMB data\nfrom ESA's Planck mission, PR4, to evaluate the current status of these\ndeviations. We employ the Power tensor method which allows an invariant\ncharacterization of the distribution of power in a given multipole, and apply\nit to probe the first sixty multipoles i.e., $l=2$ to 61. We find that there\nare significant number of modes that are intrinsically anisotropic with a\ncumulative probability of $0.3\\%$. However since the planarity study reveals\nthat those modes that are unusually planar are subset of these anisotropic\nmodes, we conclude that they may not be intrinsically planar. The quadrupole is\nstill well aligned with the octopole. Besides, $l=3$, higher multipoles aligned\nwith quadrupole are found to be insignificant. Interestingly, the collective\nalignment axis of the first sixty multipoles is found to be broadly closer to\nthe axis of dipole, quadrupole, octopole and other modes aligned with $l=2$.",

In the rank one case (in\nparticular, for hyperbolic spaces), we show that the sufficient condition for\nthe \\textit{shifted} Pitt's inequality matches the necessary condition in the\nrange $p \\leq q \\leq p'$, yielding a sharp characterization of admissible\npolynomial weights with non-negative exponents.\n  In the Jacobi setting, we modify the transform so that the associated measure\nexhibits polynomial volume growth.

These issues make it difficult to achieve both high accuracy and\nstrong generalization simultaneously. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes a Spatial-Physical Informed Attention Residual Network (SPI-BoTER).\nThis method integrates the kinematic equations of the robotic manipulator with\na Transformer architecture enhanced by sparse self-attention masks.

This separate\nencoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,\nthese methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often\nrequiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.\nInspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.\nMatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the\ndetector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and\ncamera views.

The physical mechanisms enhance the SemiPDE model's stability and\ninterpretability, while the data-driven components improve adaptivity to\ncomplex real-world scenarios.

We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL fine-tuning\nintervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are\ninfluenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., \"a\nStanford professor thinks the answer is A\"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently\ntrain models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which\nincorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to exploit\nthese cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models exploit\nthese cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained model's\nresponses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we perform RL\nwithout VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%; with a\ndebiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT achieves\nthis by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the influence of\ncues, from 8% to 43% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL. Baselines remain low\neven after RL (11% and 1%).

Most existing methods of\nefficient garment unfolding overlook the crucial role of standardization of\nflattened garments, which could significantly simplify downstream tasks like\nfolding, ironing, and packing. This paper presents APS-Net, a novel approach to\ngarment manipulation that combines unfolding and standardization in a unified\nframework. APS-Net employs a dual-arm, multi-primitive policy with dynamic\nfling to quickly unfold crumpled garments and pick-and-place (p and p) for\nprecise alignment. The purpose of garment standardization during unfolding\ninvolves not only maximizing surface coverage but also aligning the garment's\nshape and orientation to predefined requirements. To guide effective robot\nlearning, we introduce a novel factorized reward function for standardization,\nwhich incorporates garment coverage (Cov), keypoint distance (KD), and\nintersection-over-union (IoU) metrics. Additionally, we introduce a spatial\naction mask and an Action Optimized Module to improve unfolding efficiency by\nselecting actions and operation points effectively. In simulation, APS-Net\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods for long sleeves, achieving 3.9 percent\nbetter coverage, 5.2 percent higher IoU, and a 0.14 decrease in KD (7.09\npercent relative reduction). Real-world folding tasks further demonstrate that\nstandardization simplifies the folding process. Project page: see\nhttps://hellohaia.github.io/APS/",

Demand in developed countries is\nmore sensitive to high temperatures than in less developed countries, possibly\ndue to an inability to meet cooling demands in the latter.",

    "abstract": "Due to quantum fluctuations, non-orthogonal quantum states cannot be\ndistinguished with complete certainty, making their underlying physical\nparameters difficult to resolve. Traditionally, it has been believed that the\nlinewidth of a system behaves like these quantum fluctuations to set the\nultimate limit on frequency resolution as two oscillating electromagnetic\nfields are applied. Consequently, the measurement time required to resolve a\nfrequency difference $\\Delta \\omega$ was assumed to diverge as $\\Delta \\omega\n\\rightarrow 0$. Here, we show that linewidth does not play a defining role in\nresolving two closely spaced frequencies. Instead, the ultimate limit is set by\nparameter-independent quantum fluctuations, such as shot noise in our case. We\npropose and experimentally demonstrate the first general broadband protocol for\nsuper-resolution spectroscopy. Specifically, our protocol uses a\nWalsh-modulated dynamical decoupling (WMDD) sequence to encode $\\Delta \\omega$\nbetween two unknown tones into a quantum state. This leverages phase\ninformation to suppress parameter-independent shot noise, thereby enhancing the\nsignal-to-noise ratio and enabling super-resolution spectroscopy. With this\napproach, we resolve two randomly chosen oscillating electric fields of order\n100 MHz separated by 5 Hz, with a measured frequency difference of 5.0(1.6) Hz\nusing a measurement time per run of just 1 ms, representing an improvement of\n200 beyond the traditional resolution limit. As such, our technique accelerates\ndata acquisition by more than $10^5$ magnitude compared to conventional\nmethods. Crucially, as our protocol is rooted in the motional Raman (quantum\nvector signal analyzer) framework, it is effective across an arbitrary\nfrequency range and thus promises to enhance broadband sensing of\nelectromagnetic fields and improve spectral efficiency of next-generation\ncommunication systems.",

The critical discovery is that the power of Hawking\nradiation converges to a finite value for an extreme dilatonic black hole,\nwhich directly exposes the singularity in finite time. The spectrum of Hawking\nradiation of extreme dilatonic black holes becomes a truncated shrink Planck\ndistribution. We analyze the underlying physics of the spectrum of Hawking\nradiation, which roots in extraordinarily wide potential around the horizon.

    "abstract": "Metalenses offer significant potential for ultra-compact computational\nimaging but face challenges from complex optical degradation and computational\nrestoration difficulties. Existing methods typically rely on precise optical\ncalibration or massive paired datasets, which are non-trivial for real-world\nimaging systems. Furthermore, a lack of control over the inference process\noften results in undesirable hallucinated artifacts. We introduce\nDegradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography,\nleveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of\nlarge datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths\nto balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and\nsuppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside \\textit{pseudo} data\naugmentation. A tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity\nand perceptual quality. Additionally, a spatially varying degradation-aware\nattention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced\ndegradation. Finally, we design and build a millimeter-scale MetaCamera for\nreal-world validation.

    "abstract": "Colored point cloud, which includes geometry and attribute components, is a\nmainstream representation enabling realistic and immersive 3D applications. To\ngenerate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep\nlearning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that\nlearns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial\nattribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset\nfor colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121\nlarge-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute\ncomplexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve\nthe quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU\nframework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a\ngeometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the\nlatter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood\ncorrelations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute\nup-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation\n(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate\ncoarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement\nmodule is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce\nhigh-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and\ngeometry patterns. Extensive experiments show that the Peak Signal-to-Noise\nRatio (PSNR) achieved by the proposed JGAU method is 33.90 decibels, 32.10\ndecibels, 31.10 decibels, and 30.39 decibels for up-sampling rates of 4 times,\n8 times, 12 times, and 16 times, respectively. Compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, JGAU achieves average PSNR gains of 2.32 decibels, 2.47 decibels, 2.28\ndecibels, and 2.11 decibels at these four up-sampling rates, demonstrating\nsignificant improvement.",

The approach combines numerical averaging of\nosculating orbital elements with Gaussian-mixture-model (GMM) filtering with\nrobust fallback strategies to isolate a dynamically coherent subset of mean\nelements at a common reference epoch. From this filtered ensemble, a\nrepresentative osculating element is reconstructed, yielding a recovered\nCartesian state vector with predictive capability far exceeding that of raw\nTLE-based propagations and existing approaches. We apply this method to the\ncase of OGO-1 (1964-054A), a spacecraft launched into a cislunar orbit and\ntracked intermittently over five decades. Despite large observational gaps and\nsignificant secular evolution, our recovered state, used within an unscented\nKalman filter (UKF), accurately reproduces the full trajectory, including its\natmospheric reentry in August 2020, to within one day of the true decay time.\nThis result demonstrates the viability of filtered TLE statistics as a proxy\nfor precise orbit determination, particularly in dynamical regimes where\nresonances and long-period perturbations dominate. The techniques presented\nhere provide a framework for trajectory reconstruction and prediction using\nonly publicly available data and are broadly applicable to the study of\nhigh-altitude debris objects and legacy space missions whose original tracking\nand covariance data are unavailable.",

Analytical calculations show that a critical tilt angle of $i_{\\rm\ncrit} \\gtrsim 50^\\circ$ for moderately eccentric binaries is needed for polar\nalignment of circumbinary discs in systems with low disc-to-binary angular\nmomentum ratios. For higher ratios, this angle converges to the Kozai-Lidov\ninstability threshold of $\\sim 39^\\circ$. We identify disc parameters, such as\nviscosity ($\\alpha = 10^{-4}$) and aspect ratio ($H/r = 0.05$), that enable\npolar alignment within typical disc lifetimes. Notably, a circumbinary disc\naround a low-mass binary, such as a brown dwarf binary, will require more time\nto achieve polar alignment compared to higher-mass systems. A hydrodynamical\nsimulation confirms that an initially inclined disc around a brown dwarf\nevolves towards a polar state, creating favorable conditions for polar planet\nformation. Using these results, we finish by placing 2M1510 AB into a wider\ncontext and speculate why such a polar circumbinary configuration has not been\nidentified before.",

This study addresses the orbital design challenge\nassociated with inspecting numerous satellites distributed across multiple\norbital planes through flybys by proposing an innovative orbital-plane-based\ninspection strategy. The proposed methodology reformulates the multi-satellite\nflyby problem into a multi-rendezvous trajectory planning problem by proposing\nan analytical approach to determine a maneuver-free inspection orbit that\nenables flyby of all satellites within a specific orbital plane. Additionally,\na three-layer global optimization framework is developed to tackle this\nproblem. The first layer establishes an approximate cost evaluation model for\norbital plane visitation sequences, utilizing a genetic algorithm to identify\nthe optimal sequence from a vast array of candidate planes, thereby maximizing\ninspection targets while minimizing fuel consumption. The second layer\nconstructs a mixed-integer programming model to locally refine the rendezvous\nepochs and orbital parameters of each inspection orbit to reduce the total\nvelocity increment. The third layer accurately computes the optimal impulsive\nmaneuvers and trajectories between inspection orbits. In contrast to\ntraditional low-Earth orbit rendezvous optimization frameworks, the proposed\nframework fully leverages the adjustable freedom in inclination and right\nascension of the ascending node (RAAN) of inspection orbits, significantly\nreducing the total velocity increment.

    "abstract": "Deep learning offers transformative potential in medical imaging, yet its\nclinical adoption is frequently hampered by challenges such as data scarcity,\ndistribution shifts, and the need for robust task generalization. Prompt-based\nmethodologies have emerged as a pivotal strategy to guide deep learning models,\nproviding flexible, domain-specific adaptations that significantly enhance\nmodel performance and adaptability without extensive retraining. This\nsystematic review critically examines the burgeoning landscape of prompt\nengineering in medical imaging. We dissect diverse prompt modalities, including\ntextual instructions, visual prompts, and learnable embeddings, and analyze\ntheir integration for core tasks such as image generation, segmentation, and\nclassification. Our synthesis reveals how these mechanisms improve\ntask-specific outcomes by enhancing accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency\nand reducing reliance on manual feature engineering while fostering greater\nmodel interpretability by making the model's guidance explicit. Despite\nsubstantial advancements, we identify persistent challenges, particularly in\nprompt design optimization, data heterogeneity, and ensuring scalability for\nclinical deployment. Finally, this review outlines promising future\ntrajectories, including advanced multimodal prompting and robust clinical\nintegration, underscoring the critical role of prompt-driven AI in accelerating\nthe revolution of diagnostics and personalized treatment planning in medicine.",

However, a significant portion of the BVI population in\nIndia remains unemployed despite extensive accessibility advancements and job\nsearch interventions. Therefore, we conducted semi-structured interviews with\n20 BVI persons who were either pursuing or recently sought employment in the\ndigital industry. Our findings reveal that despite gaining digital literacy and\nextensive training, BVI individuals struggle to meet industry requirements for\nfulfilling job openings. While they engage in self-reflection to identify\nshortcomings in their approach and skills, they lack constructive feedback from\npeers and recruiters. Moreover, the numerous job intervention tools are limited\nin their ability to meet the unique needs of BVI job seekers.

Consequently, the extended\ncNMSSE is applicable to environments beyond those characterized by Debye-type\nspectral densities. The flexibility to employ general basis functions is\nparticularly advantageous for handling spectral densities with higher-order\npoles, for which exponential decompositions are often inaccurate or\nunavailable. The extended cNMSSE is implemented in a pseudo-Fock space using\nconventional ladder operators and solved efficiently via matrix product state\n(MPS) techniques, preserving the favorable linear-scaling and\nwavefunction-based nature of the original method. Benchmark simulations across\nfour representative cases, including discrete spectral density, Ohmic spectral\ndensity with exponential and algebraic cutoffs, and critically damped Brownian\nspectral density, demonstrate excellent agreement with results of hierarchy of\nforward-backward stochastic Schr\\\"odinger equations (HFB-SSE) and extended\nhierarchical equation of motion (HEOM).",

By embedding a degradation-aware prompt learning\nmodule, UniFuse seamlessly integrates multi-directional information from input\nimages and correlates cross-modal alignment with restoration, enabling joint\noptimization of both tasks within a unified framework. Additionally, we design\nan Omni Unified Feature Representation scheme, which leverages Spatial Mamba to\nencode multi-directional features and mitigate modality differences in feature\nalignment. To enable simultaneous restoration and fusion within an All-in-One\nconfiguration, we propose a Universal Feature Restoration & Fusion module,\nincorporating the Adaptive LoRA Synergistic Network (ALSN) based on LoRA\nprinciples. By leveraging ALSN's adaptive feature representation along with\ndegradation-type guidance, we enable joint restoration and fusion within a\nsingle-stage framework.

Therefore, effective data recovery methods are\nessential to ensure the reliability of downstream data-driven applications.\nwhile classical tensor completion methods have been widely adopted, they are\nincapable of modeling noise, making them unsuitable for complex scenarios\ninvolving simultaneous data missingness and noise interference. Existing Robust\nTensor Completion (RTC) approaches offer potential solutions by separately\nmodeling the actual tensor data and noise. However, their effectiveness is\noften constrained by the over-relaxation of convex rank surrogates and the\nsuboptimal utilization of local consistency, leading to inadequate model\naccuracy. To address these limitations, we first introduce the tensor L1-L2\nnorm, a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate that functions as an effective\nlow-rank representation tool. Leveraging an advanced feature fusion strategy,\nwe further develop the gradient tensor L1-L2 norm by incorporating the tensor\nL1-L2 norm in the gradient domain. By integrating the gradient tensor nuclear\nL1-L2 norm into the RTC framework, we propose the Robust Tensor Completion via\nGradient Tensor Nuclear L1-L2 Norm (RTC-GTNLN) model, which not only fully\nexploits both global low-rankness and local consistency without trade-off\nparameter, but also effectively handles the dual degradation challenges of\nmissing data and noise in traffic data.

A common approach is to\nperturb the message-passing process, which forms the core of most GNN\narchitectures. However, existing methods typically incur a privacy cost that\ngrows linearly with the number of layers (Usenix Security'23), ultimately\nrequiring excessive noise to maintain a reasonable privacy level. This\nlimitation becomes particularly problematic when deep GNNs are necessary to\ncapture complex and long-range interactions in graphs.

    "abstract": "Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems offers significant\nopportunities for smart applications. However, its training and development are\nhindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of\nedge systems. Current methods that rely on transferring pre-trained models\noften encounter issues such as modality shift and high resource demands,\nresulting in substantial accuracy loss, resource overhead, and poor\nadaptability across different sensing applications. In this paper, we propose\nXTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method for resource-efficient, modality-agnostic\nmodel transfer. XTransfer freely leverages single or multiple pre-trained\nmodels and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model\nrepairing that safely repairs modality shift in pre-trained model layers with\nonly few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and\nrecombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to\ncreate compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human\nsensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results\ndemonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance on human\nsensing tasks while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection,\nmodel training, and edge deployment.",

Second, an adversarial\ninput, whether a perturbed sample in AE attacks or a trigger-carrying sample in\nbackdoor attacks, exhibits distinctive trajectory signatures from a benign\nsample as it propagates through the layers of a DL model in forward inference.\nThe propagation trajectory of the adversarial sample must deviate from that of\nits benign counterpart; otherwise, the adversarial objective cannot be\nfulfilled.

This\nreliance introduces challenges related to reproducibility, subjectivity, and\nlimited integration of interface-level data. In particular, current approaches\nlack the capacity to rigorously assess how human-machine interface design\ncontributes to operator performance variability and error susceptibility. To\naddress these limitations, this study proposes a framework for risk-informed\nhuman failure event identification and interface-induced risk assessment driven\nby AutoGraph (InSight-R). By linking empirical behavioral data to the\ninterface-embedded knowledge graph (IE-KG) constructed by the automated\ngraph-based execution framework (AutoGraph), the InSight-R framework enables\nautomated HFE identification based on both error-prone and time-deviated\noperational paths. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between\ndesigner-user conflicts and human error. The results demonstrate that InSight-R\nnot only enhances the objectivity and interpretability of HFE identification\nbut also provides a scalable pathway toward dynamic, real-time human\nreliability assessment in digitalized control environments.

In this paper, we present a method to solve\nthese two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single\narticulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point\nclouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.\nInstead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the\nobject surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the\nobject undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using\nmeasurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods\nthat rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an\nalternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we\nrepresent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D\nGaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,\ntranslations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our\nrepresentation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences\nbetween the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of\neach point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned\nGaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our\nmethod outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point\ncorrespondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate\nreal-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further\ndemonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to\nexisting approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are\ncompletely occluded in some time-steps.

In addition, Libra incorporates systematic optimizations for\nheterogeneous computing, including hybrid load-balancing, finely optimized\nkernel implementations, and GPU-accelerated preprocessing. Extensive\nexperimental results on H100 and RTX 4090 GPUs show that Libra outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art by on average 3.1x (up to 9.23x) over DTC-SpMM and 2.9x (up to\n3.9x) for end-to-end GNN applications. Libra opens up a new perspective for\nsparse operator acceleration by fully exploiting the heterogeneous computing\nresources on GPUs.",

    "abstract": "Low-rank matrix approximation plays an important role in various applications\nsuch as image processing, signal processing and data analysis. The existing\nmethods require a guess of the ranks of matrices that represent images or\ninvolve additional costs to determine the ranks. A novel efficient orthogonal\ndecomposition with automatic basis extraction (EOD-ABE) is proposed to compute\nthe optimal low-rank matrix approximation with adaptive identification of the\noptimal rank. By introducing a randomized basis extraction mechanism, EOD-ABE\neliminates the need for additional rank determination steps and can compute a\nrank-revealing approximation to a low-rank matrix. With a computational\ncomplexity of $O(mnr)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of the matrix and\n$r$ is its rank, EOD-ABE achieves significant speedups compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superior speed,\naccuracy and robustness of EOD-ABE and indicate that EOD-ABE is a powerful tool\nfor fast image compression and reconstruction and hyperspectral image\ndimensionality reduction in large-scale applications.",

A striking phenomenon is linear mode connectivity (LMC), where\nindependently trained models can be connected by low- or zero-loss paths,\ndespite appearing to lie in separate loss basins. However, this is often\nobscured by symmetries in parameter space -- such as neuron permutations --\nwhich make functionally equivalent models appear dissimilar. Prior work has\npredominantly focused on neuron re-ordering through permutations, but such\napproaches are limited in scope and fail to capture the richer symmetries\nexhibited by modern architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we\nintroduce a unified framework that captures four symmetry classes:\npermutations, semi-permutations, orthogonal transformations, and general\ninvertible maps -- broadening the set of valid reparameterizations and\nsubsuming many previous approaches as special cases. Crucially, this\ngeneralization enables, for the first time, the discovery of low- and\nzero-barrier linear interpolation paths between independently trained Vision\nTransformers and GPT-2 models.

This paper presents FairMarket-RL, a novel\nhybrid framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) to enable fairness-aware trading agents. In a simulated P2P\nmicrogrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time\nfairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics:\nFairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness\nscores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled\n{\\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that\nreplaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints. Agents are trained using\nIndependent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and achieve equitable outcomes,\nfulfilling over 90% of buyer demand, maintaining fair seller margins, and\nconsistently reaching FTB and FBS scores above 0.80. The training process\ndemonstrates that fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer\nshortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers. With its\nlanguage-based critic, the framework scales naturally, and its extension to a\nlarge power distribution system with household prosumers illustrates its\npractical applicability.

We derive\ntheoretical upper bounds on how many Krylov steps are needed for functions such\nas $A^{-1/2}$ and $A^{-1}$ by analyzing the upper bounds from the polynomial\napproximation of their scalar equivalent. In addition, we also develop lower\nlimits on the number of queries needed for trace estimation, specifically for\n$\\text{tr}(W^{-p})$ where $W$ is a Wishart matrix. Our study clarifies the\nconnection between the number of steps in Block Krylov methods and the degree\nof the polynomial used for approximation. This links the total cost of trace\nestimation to basic limits in polynomial approximation and how much information\nis needed for the computation.",

The first four of these clusters were observed to be highly\ninterconnected, providing evidence that the impacts and experiences within them\nare interrelated with other clusters, particularly interactions with the\naudience, which is a central feature of informal physics programs.

Large sets of numerical results\nare processed and connected in a consistent manner, using two key quantities:\nthe mass of the star's Carbon-Oxygen (CO) core at an advanced pre-collapse\nstage - which depends on binary evolution effects - and the compactness\nparameter, which is the main descriptor of the post-collapse neutrino emission.\nThe method enables us to model the neutrino emission of a very diverse,\nbinary-affected population of stars, which cannot unambiguously be mapped in\ndetail by existing core collapse simulations. We find that including black\nhole-forming collapses enhances the DSNB by up to 50% at energies greater than\n30-40 MeV. Binary evolution effects can change the total rate of collapses and\ngenerate a sub-population of high core mass stars that are stronger neutrino\nemitters. However, the net effect on the DSNB is moderate - up to a 15%\nincrease in flux - due to the rarity of these super-massive cores and to the\nrelatively modest dependence of the neutrino emission on the CO core mass. The\nmethodology presented here is suitable for extensions and generalizations, and\ntherefore it lays the foundation for modern treatments of the DSNB.",

Through collaborative dialogue across cognitive, linguistic,\nand technological perspectives, workshop participants examined the underlying\nprocesses involved when humans produce and comprehend text, and how AI can both\ninform our understanding of these processes and augment human capabilities. The\nworkshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language\nmodels (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of\nLLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language\nunderstanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to\noffer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between\nLLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with\nhuman feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI\ncollaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report\naims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in\ncognitive psychology, linguistics, and education.

An overview of the programme is\npresented, detailing the hardware, software, and observing strategy. Pulsar\ntiming results are discussed, focusing on timing noise and glitches. It is\nshown that the scaling of residuals due to timing noise with pulsar parameters\nand observing timespan is consistent with earlier studies, and that the\nrecovered timing noise parameters remain consistent as the observing timespan\nis increased. Second frequency derivatives are investigated, and it is shown\nthat the uncertainty on $\\ddot{\\nu}$ is sensitive to the frequency cutoff in\nthe timing noise model, varying by three-fold approximately depending on\nwhether Fourier modes with frequency lower than the reciprocal of the observing\ntimespan are included. We measure 39 non-zero values of $\\ddot{\\nu}$ when\nconsidering both models with and without low-frequency modes. An analytic\nscaling relating anomalous braking indices to timing noise amplitude is also\nvalidated. Glitches in the sample are discussed, including three detected by an\n``online'' glitch detection pipeline using a hidden Markov model (HMM). In\ntotal 17 glitches are discussed, one of which, in PSR J1902+0615, has not been\nreported elsewhere. An ``offline'' glitch search pipeline using the HMM\nframework is used to search for previously undetected glitches. Systematic\nupper limits are set on the size of undetected glitches.

A\ndrafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language\nmodels, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree\nconsisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target\nmodel, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered\nthat the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies\nof the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the\nvocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We\nfirst identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an\nunnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs\nwith very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,\nto mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in\nmemory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain\nonly a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the\nvocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting\nslightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting\nlatency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,\nresulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can\nboost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically\nby 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.",

In choosing\nthe regularizing sparsity-promoting operator, it is assumed that the particular\ntype of variability of the underlying signal, for example, piecewise constant\nor piecewise linear behavior across the entire domain, is both known and fixed.\nSuch an assumption is problematic in more general cases, e.g.~when a signal\nexhibits piecewise oscillatory behavior with varying wavelengths and\nmagnitudes. To address the limitations of assuming a fixed (and typically low\norder) variability when choosing a sparsity-promoting operator, this\ninvestigation proposes a novel residual transform operator that can be used\nwithin the Lasso regression formulation. In a nutshell, the idea is that for a\ngeneral piecewise smooth signal $f$, it is possible to design two operators\n$\\mathcal L_1$ and $\\mathcal L_2$ such that $\\mathcal L_1{\\boldsymbol f}\n\\approx \\mathcal L_2{\\boldsymbol f}$, where ${\\boldsymbol f} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$\nis a discretized approximation of $f$, but $\\mathcal L_1 \\not\\approx \\mathcal\nL_2$. The corresponding residual transform operator, $\\mathcal L = \\mathcal\nL_1- \\mathcal L_2$, yields a result that (1) effectively reduces the\nvariability dependent error that occurs when applying either $\\mathcal L_1$ or\n$\\mathcal L_2$ to ${\\boldsymbol f}$, a property that holds even when $\\mathcal\nL_1{\\boldsymbol f} \\approx \\mathcal L_2{\\boldsymbol f}$ is not a good\napproximation to the true sparse domain vector of ${\\boldsymbol f}$, and (2)\ndoes not require $\\mathcal L_1$ or $\\mathcal L_2$ to have prior information\nregarding the variability of the underlying signal.",
