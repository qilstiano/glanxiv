    "abstract": "Automating software vulnerability detection (SVD) remains a critical\nchallenge in an era of increasingly complex and interdependent software\nsystems. Despite significant advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code\nanalysis, prevailing evaluation methodologies often lack the\n\\textbf{context-aware robustness} necessary to capture real-world intricacies\nand cross-component interactions. To address these limitations, we present\n\\textbf{VulnSage}, a comprehensive evaluation framework and a dataset curated\nfrom diverse, large-scale open-source system software projects developed in\nC/C++. Unlike prior datasets, it leverages a heuristic noise pre-filtering\napproach combined with LLM-based reasoning to ensure a representative and\nminimally noisy spectrum of vulnerabilities. The framework supports\nmulti-granular analysis across function, file, and inter-function levels and\nemploys four diverse zero-shot prompt strategies: Baseline, Chain-of-Thought,\nThink, and Think & Verify. Through this evaluation, we uncover that structured\nreasoning prompts substantially improve LLM performance, with Think & Verify\nreducing ambiguous responses from 20.3% to 9.1% while increasing accuracy. We\nfurther demonstrate that code-specialized models consistently outperform\ngeneral-purpose alternatives, with performance varying significantly across\nvulnerability types, revealing that no single approach universally excels\nacross all security contexts.

Our\nexperiments show that EXPLICATE attains 98.4 % accuracy on all metrics, which\nis on par with existing deep learning techniques but has better explainability.\nHigh-quality explanations are generated by the framework with an accuracy of\n94.2 % as well as a consistency of 96.8\\% between the LLM output and model\nprediction.

In practice, such\n\"harmlessness\" behavior is mainly achieved by training models to reject harmful\nrequests, such as \"Explain how to burn down my neighbor's house\", where the\nmodel appropriately declines to respond. However, this approach can\ninadvertently result in false refusal, where models reject benign queries as\nwell, such as \"Tell me how to kill a Python process\". In this work, we\ndemonstrate that prompting safety reflection before generating a response can\nmitigate false refusal behavior. Building on this finding, we introduce the\nThink-Before-Refusal (TBR) schema and conduct safety-aware instruction\nfine-tuning incorporating safety reflection. In an ablation study across 15\npre-trained models, we show that models fine-tuned with safety reflection\nsignificantly reduce false refusal behavior while maintaining safety and\noverall performance compared to those fine-tuned without safety reflection.",

While both traditional\nand deep learning approaches have been explored, deep learning models offer a\npromising direction for improving efficiency and consistency in sea ice\nclassification.

IceBench is open-source and\nallows for convenient integration and evaluation of other sea ice type\nclassification methods; hence, facilitating comparative evaluation of new\nmethods and improving reproducibility in the field.

Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in extending the context window\nlength of existing LLMs. The experimental outcomes and extensive data validate\nthe framework's superiority over five baseline models in terms of BLEU and\nROUGE performance metrics, with substantial leads in certain capabilities.\nNotably, ablation studies confirm the significance of the TEIR and EICL\ncomponents.

This transformation, I argue, moves\nbeyond false consciousness towards what I call post-consciousness, where the\nboundaries between individual and synthetic consciousness become porous.\nDrawing on critical theory and extending recent work on computational ideology,\nI develop three key theoretical contributions, first, the concept of the\nInversion to describe a new computational turn in algorithmic society; second,\nautomimetric production as a framework for understanding emerging practices of\nautomated value creation; and third, constellational analysis as a\nmethodological approach for mapping the complex interplay of technical systems,\ncultural forms and political economic structures.

However, the astrophysical environments\nin which this can happen and the rate of such mergers are open questions in\nastrophysics. Gravitational waves may play an important role in answering these\nquestions. In this context, we discuss the possibility that the primary of the\nrecent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binary GW230529_181500 (GW230529, in short) is the\nproduct of a previous BNS merger. Invoking numerical relativity (NR)-based\nfitting formulas that map the binary constituents' masses and tidal\ndeformabilities to the mass, spin, and kick velocity of the remnant BH, we\ninvestigate the potential parents of GW230529's primary. Our calculations using\nNR fits based on BNS simulations reveal that the remnant of a high-mass BNS\nmerger similar to GW190425 is consistent with the primary of GW230529. This\nargument is further strengthened by the gravitational wave-based merger rate\nestimation of GW190425-like and GW230529-like populations. We show that around\n18% (median) of the GW190425-like remnants could become the primary component\nin GW230529-like mergers.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has become an increasingly important paradigm in the\ndomain of machine intelligence. Furthermore, evidence for self-supervised\nadaptation, such as contrastive formulations, has emerged in recent\ncomputational neuroscience and brain-inspired research. Nevertheless, current\nwork on self-supervised learning relies on biologically implausible credit\nassignment -- in the form of backpropagation of errors -- and feedforward\ninference, typically a forward-locked pass. Predictive coding, in its\nmechanistic form, offers a biologically plausible means to sidestep these\nbackprop-specific limitations. However, unsupervised predictive coding rests on\nlearning a generative model of raw pixel input (akin to ``generative AI''\napproaches), which entails predicting a potentially high dimensional input; on\nthe other hand, supervised predictive coding, which learns a mapping between\ninputs to target labels, requires human annotation, and thus incurs the\ndrawbacks of supervised learning. In this work, we present a scheme for\nself-supervised learning within a neurobiologically plausible framework that\nappeals to the free energy principle, constructing a new form of predictive\ncoding that we call meta-representational predictive coding (MPC). MPC\nsidesteps the need for learning a generative model of sensory input (e.g.,\npixel-level features) by learning to predict representations of sensory input\nacross parallel streams, resulting in an encoder-only learning and inference\nscheme. This formulation rests on active inference (in the form of sensory\nglimpsing) to drive the learning of representations, i.e., the representational\ndynamics are driven by sequences of decisions made by the model to sample\ninformative portions of its sensorium.",

First, GSound-SIR provides direct access to up to\nmillions of raw ray data points from simulations, enabling in-depth analysis of\nsound propagation paths that was not possible with previous solutions.

This innovation creates a tiered memory architecture combining local DDR\nand remote CXL memory with distinct performance characteristics.\n  In this paper, we investigate the architectural implications of CXL memory,\nfocusing on its increased latency and performance heterogeneity, which can\nundermine the efficiency of existing processor designs optimized for\n(relatively) uniform memory latency. Using carefully designed micro-benchmarks,\nwe identify bottlenecks such as limited hardware-level parallelism in CXL\nmemory, unfair queuing in memory request handling, and its impact on DDR memory\nperformance and inter-core synchronization. Our findings reveal that the\ndisparity in memory tier parallelism can reduce DDR memory bandwidth by up to\n81% under heavy loads. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Memory\nRequest Control mechanism, MIKU, that prioritizes DDR memory requests while\nserving CXL memory requests on a best-effort basis.

Second, again\nfor a single Weyl element $w_{2,1,1}$ and its conjugate $w_{1,1,2}$, it appears\nthat the space of solutions to the Bessel differential equations may not be\nspanned by the Frobenius series solutions.

While synthetic datasets offer an alternative,\nexisting options exhibit task-specific limitations, unrealistic scene\ncompositions, and rendering artifacts that compromise real-world applicability.\nWe introduce ClaraVid, a synthetic aerial dataset specifically designed to\novercome these limitations. Comprising 16,917 high-resolution images captured\nat 4032x3024 from multiple viewpoints across diverse landscapes, ClaraVid\nprovides dense depth maps, panoptic segmentation, sparse point clouds, and\ndynamic object masks, while mitigating common rendering artifacts.

Utilizing DSP, we systematically benchmark neural reconstruction\nmethods, uncovering a consistent, measurable correlation between scene\ncomplexity and reconstruction accuracy. Empirical results indicate that higher\ndelentropy strongly correlates with increased reconstruction errors, validating\nDSP as a reliable complexity prior.

This work advances the field of decision\ntree-based modeling, offering a more flexible and accurate approach for\nhandling structured data and complex tasks.

We develop the\nformalism of rescaled Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, taking in account the\nGW170817 constraints on the gravitational wave speed. We show explicitly how\nthe rescaled theory affects directly the primordial scalar and tensor\nperturbations, and how the slow-roll and observational indices of inflation are\naffected by the rescaling of the theory.

To assess the\nstatistical significance of these deviations, we devise a general methodology\nbased on the persistence of the deviations across threshold ranges and spatial\nresolutions, while taking into account correlations among the statistics.

Since\ndeviations in smaller sky regions tend to get washed out when averaged over\nlarger regions, we further analyze smaller sky patches. This localized analysis\nreveals some patches that exhibit statistically significant deviations which we\nrefer to as 'anomalous'. We find that near the CMB cold spot, both the positive\nand negative density fluctuations are anomalous, at 99% CL and 95% CL\nrespectively. This region also encompasses an anomalous southern spot\npreviously identified in Planck CMB temperature data. We also carry out a\ncomparison of anomalous patches identified here for ACT data with a previous\nanalysis of the convergence map from Planck.

However, the generative nature of\nLLMs raises concerns about presenting misinformation as fact. To address this,\nwe developed a web-based application that helps K-12 students enhance critical\nthinking by identifying misleading information in LLM responses about major\nhistorical figures. In this paper, we describe the implementation and design\ndetails of the DoYouTrustAI tool, which can be used to provide an interactive\nlesson which teaches students about the dangers of misinformation and how\nbelievable generative AI can make it seem. The DoYouTrustAI tool utilizes\nprompt engineering to present the user with AI generated summaries about the\nlife of a historical figure. These summaries can be either accurate accounts of\nthat persons life, or an intentionally misleading alteration of their history.\nThe user is tasked with determining the validity of the statement without\nexternal resources. Our research questions for this work were:(RQ1) How can we\ndesign a tool that teaches students about the dangers of misleading information\nand of how misinformation can present itself in LLM responses? (RQ2) Can we\npresent prompt engineering as a topic that is easily understandable for\nstudents? Our findings highlight the need to correct misleading information\nbefore users retain it. Our tool lets users select familiar individuals for\ntesting to reduce random guessing and presents misinformation alongside known\nfacts to maintain believability. It also provides pre-configured prompt\ninstructions to show how different prompts affect AI responses. Together, these\nfeatures create a controlled environment where users learn the importance of\nverifying AI responses and understanding prompt engineering.",

This analogy connects these seemingly\nunrelated systems through the concept of dynamic stability. The rotating saddle\npotential is analytically tractable, allowing us to prove the existence of\nbounded charged particle trajectories under certain conditions. By focusing on\nstellar-mass black holes with a weak electric charge-a feature consistent with\nspecific astrophysical conditions that leaves the spacetime metric largely\nunaffected but can influence nearby particle interactions-we can neglect\ncomplicating factors such as magnetic fields from large accretion disks of\nheavier black holes or stellar winds.

This system is\ndistinctive in the literature for its non-orbital trapping mechanism. While\ntheoretically intriguing, this trapping relies on specific conditions,\nincluding nearly identical black hole masses. These types of non-orbital\ntrapping mechanisms could potentially allow for longer-lived plasma\nconfigurations, enhancing our ability to detect electromagnetic signatures from\nthese systems.

To obtain inflationary bispectra and\ntrispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled\nscalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations\ndetermined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator.\nBased on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the\nspinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the\ncurrents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the\nhelp of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the\nresulting shape functions.

It is known that planar/vertical Lyapunov orbits\nand Lissajous orbits near the collinear libration points undergo pitchfork\nbifurcations with varying orbital energy. These bifurcations induce symmetry\nbreaking, generating bifurcated families including halo/quasi-halo orbits,\naxial/quasi-axial orbits, and their corresponding invariant manifolds.\nTraditional semi-analytical methods for constructing halo orbits, based on\nresonant bifurcation mechanisms, have obstacles in fully exploiting the\nintrinsic symmetry breaking characteristics in pitchfork bifurcations. In this\npaper, a unified trigonometric series-based framework is proposed to analyze\nthese bifurcated families from the perspective of coupling-induced bifurcation\nmechanisms. By introducing a coupling coefficient and various bifurcation\nequations into the ERTBP, different symmetry breaking is achieved when the\ncoupling coefficient is non-zero. This unified semi-analytical framework\ncaptures bifurcations of both periodic/quasi-periodic and transit/non-transit\norbits.

When jets penetrate deeply into the planet's interior,\nthe Taylor column height decreases equatorward in the equatorial jet region,\nyielding a negative gradient of planetary potential vorticity (i.e., a negative\nbeta effect). The tendency to eliminate such a gradient leads to a prograde\nequatorial jet, as observed on Jupiter and Saturn.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive 2D\nimage/video understanding capabilities. However, there are no publicly\nstandardized benchmarks to assess the abilities of MLLMs in understanding the\n4D objects (3D objects with temporal evolution over time). In this paper, we\nintroduce 4D-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate the capabilities of MLLMs\nin 4D object understanding, featuring tasks in 4D object Question Answering (4D\nobject QA) and 4D object captioning. 4D-Bench provides 4D objects with diverse\ncategories, high-quality annotations, and tasks necessitating multi-view\nspatial-temporal understanding, different from existing 2D image/video-based\nbenchmarks. With 4D-Bench, we evaluate a wide range of open-source and\nclosed-source MLLMs. The results from the 4D object captioning experiment\nindicate that MLLMs generally exhibit weaker temporal understanding compared to\ntheir appearance understanding, notably, while open-source models approach\nclosed-source performance in appearance understanding, they show larger\nperformance gaps in temporal understanding. 4D object QA yields surprising\nfindings: even with simple single-object videos, MLLMs perform poorly, with\nstate-of-the-art GPT-4o achieving only 63\\% accuracy compared to the human\nbaseline of 91\\%. These findings highlight a substantial gap in 4D object\nunderstanding and the need for further advancements in MLLMs.",

    "abstract": "AI agents hold the potential to transform everyday life by helping humans\nachieve their goals. To do this successfully, agents need to be able to\ncoordinate with novel partners without prior interaction, a setting known as\nzero-shot coordination (ZSC). Overcooked has become one of the most popular\nbenchmarks for evaluating coordination capabilities of AI agents and learning\nalgorithms. In this work, we investigate the origins of ZSC challenges in\nOvercooked. We introduce a state augmentation mechanism which mixes states that\nmight be encountered when paired with unknown partners into the training\ndistribution, reducing the out-of-distribution challenge associated with ZSC.\nWe show that independently trained agents under this algorithm coordinate\nsuccessfully in Overcooked. Our results suggest that ZSC failure can largely be\nattributed to poor state coverage under self-play rather than more\nsophisticated coordination challenges. The Overcooked environment is therefore\nnot suitable as a ZSC benchmark. To address these shortcomings, we introduce\nOvercookedV2, a new version of the benchmark, which includes asymmetric\ninformation and stochasticity, facilitating the creation of interesting ZSC\nscenarios. To validate OvercookedV2, we conduct experiments demonstrating that\nmere exhaustive state coverage is insufficient to coordinate well. Finally, we\nuse OvercookedV2 to build a new range of coordination challenges, including\nones that require test time protocol formation, and we demonstrate the need for\nnew coordination algorithms that can adapt online. We hope that OvercookedV2\nwill help benchmark the next generation of ZSC algorithms and advance\ncollaboration between AI agents and humans.",

The existing methods cannot provide intuitive guidance to\nthe model, which leads to unstable output results and makes it difficult to\nmeet the large-scale and efficient annotation requirements for specific targets\nin some scenarios.

    "abstract": "Scene coordinate regression achieves impressive results in outdoor LiDAR\nlocalization but requires days of training. Since training needs to be repeated\nfor each new scene, long training times make these methods impractical for\ntime-sensitive applications, such as autonomous driving, drones, and robotics.\nWe identify large coverage areas and vast data in large-scale outdoor scenes as\nkey challenges that limit fast training. In this paper, we propose LightLoc,\nthe first method capable of efficiently learning localization in a new scene at\nlight speed. LightLoc introduces two novel techniques to address these\nchallenges. First, we introduce sample classification guidance to assist\nregression learning, reducing ambiguity from similar samples and improving\ntraining efficiency. Second, we propose redundant sample downsampling to remove\nwell-learned frames during training, reducing training time without\ncompromising accuracy. Additionally, the fast training and confidence\nestimation capabilities of sample classification enable its integration into\nSLAM, effectively eliminating error accumulation. Extensive experiments on\nlarge-scale outdoor datasets demonstrate that LightLoc achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with a 50x reduction in training time than\nexisting methods.

Even though our\nmodel reaches state-of-the-art results on the test set (sensitivity=74%, false\npositive rate=1.6), we show that neither the junior nor the senior reader\nsignificantly increase their sensitivity (p=0.59, p=1, respectively). In\naddition, we find that reading time for both readers is significantly higher in\nthe \"AI-assisted\" setting than in the \"Unassisted\" (+15 seconds, on average;\np=3x10^(-4) junior, p=3x10^(-5) senior). The confidence reported by the readers\nis unchanged across the two settings, indicating that the AI assistance does\nnot influence the certainty of the diagnosis. Our findings highlight the\nimportance of clinical validation of AI algorithms in a clinical setting\ninvolving radiologists. This study should serve as a reminder to the community\nto always examine the real-word effectiveness and workflow impact of proposed\nalgorithms.",

This leads to biased learning of medical entities in\nexisting methods, resulting in repetitiveness and inaccuracy in generated\nreports. To this end, we propose a Medical Entity-balanced Prompting Network\n(MEPNet), which harnesses the large language model (LLM) to fairly interpret\nvarious entities for accurate brain CT report generation. By introducing the\nvisual embedding and the learning status of medical entities as enriched clues,\nour method prompts the LLM to balance the learning of diverse entities, thereby\nenhancing reports with comprehensive findings. First, to extract visual\nembedding of entities, we propose Knowledge-driven Joint Attention to explore\nand distill entity patterns using both explicit and implicit medical knowledge.\nThen, a Learning Status Scorer is designed to evaluate the learning of entity\nvisual embeddings, resulting in unique learning status for individual entities.\nFinally, these entity visual embeddings and status are elaborately integrated\ninto multi-modal prompts, to guide the text generation of LLM. This process\nallows LLM to self-adapt the learning process for biased-fitted entities,\nthereby covering detailed findings in generated reports.

Intuitionistic logic (IL) has been\nproved to be incomplete over a number of variants of B-eS, including a\nmonotonic one where introduction rules play a prior role (miB-eS). In its\noriginal formulation by Prawitz, however, PTS consequence is not a primitive,\nbut a derived notion. The main concept is that of argument structure valid\nrelative to atomic systems and assignments of reductions for eliminating\ngeneralised detours of inferences in non-introduction form. This is called\nProof-Theoretic Validity (P-tV), and it can be given in a monotonic and\nintroduction-based form too (miP-tV). It is unclear whether, and under what\nconditions, the incompleteness results proved for IL over miB-eS can be\ntransferred to miP-tV. As has been remarked, the main problem seems to be that\nthe notion of argumental validity underlying the miB-eS notion of consequence\nis one where reductions are either forced to be non-uniform, or\nnon-constructive.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of intermittent distributed renewable energy sources (RES)\nin modern power systems has fundamentally compromised the reliability and\naccuracy of deterministic net load forecasting. Generative models, particularly\ndiffusion models, demonstrate exceptional potential in uncertainty\nquantification for scenario forecasting. Nevertheless, their probabilistic\npredictive capabilities and conditional bootstrapping mechanisms still remain\nunderexplored. In this paper, a day-ahead probabilistic net load forecasting\nframework is developed by systematically quantifying epistemic uncertainty and\naleatoric variability using the feature-informed enhanced conditional diffusion\nmodel (ECDM). The ECDM architecture implements the net load distribution\ngeneration process using an imputation-based conditional diffusion model, where\nmulti-modal conditional inputs, such as weather and calendar data, are fused\nvia cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, historical net load profiles are\nutilized to guide the reverse diffusion trajectory through non-parametric\nimputation operators preserving spatial-temporal integrity. To capture periodic\ncharacteristics, a novel weekly arrangement method is also introduced, while an\nunconditional model is integrated to ensure diversity in the generated\nscenarios. Subsequently, the maximum probabilistic points and probability\nintervals of predicted net load are obtained by the adaptive kernel density\nestimation under RES intermittency. Moreover, ECDM is extented to multi-energy\nforecast framework, attempting to increase interpretability of the net load\npredictions. Numerical experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate\nthe superior forecasting performance of the proposed method compared to\nexisting state-of-the-art approaches.",

In addition, we study the\nsocial diffusion process by introducing a small number of committed agents into\nthe model, and identify three key outcomes: adoption of innovation, rejection\nof innovation, and the enforcement of unpopular norms, consistent with findings\nin socio-psychological literature.

The resultant platform, known as\nedge inference, will support a wide range of Internet-of-Things applications,\nsuch as autonomous driving, industrial automation, and augmented reality. Given\nthe mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these tasks, it is essential\nto design edge inference systems that are both reliable and capable of meeting\nstringent end-to-end (E2E) latency constraints. Existing studies, which\nprimarily focus on communication reliability as characterized by channel outage\nprobability, may fail to guarantee E2E performance, specifically in terms of\nE2E inference accuracy and latency. To address this limitation, we propose a\ntheoretical framework that introduces and mathematically characterizes the\ninference outage (InfOut) probability, which quantifies the likelihood that the\nE2E inference accuracy falls below a target threshold. Under an E2E latency\nconstraint, this framework establishes a fundamental tradeoff between\ncommunication overhead (i.e., uploading more sensor observations) and inference\nreliability as quantified by the InfOut probability. To find a tractable way to\noptimize this tradeoff, we derive accurate surrogate functions for InfOut\nprobability by applying a Gaussian approximation to the distribution of the\nreceived discriminant gain.

    "abstract": "Efficient and high-performance quantum error correction is essential for\nachieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. Low-depth random circuits offer a\npromising approach to identifying effective and practical encoding strategies.\nIn this work, we construct quantum error-correcting codes based on\none-dimensional, logarithmic-depth random Clifford encoding circuits with a\ntwo-layer circuit structure. We demonstrate that these random codes typically\nexhibit good approximate quantum error correction capability by proving that\ntheir encoding rate achieves the hashing bound for Pauli noise and the channel\ncapacity for erasure errors. Moreover, we show that the error correction\ninaccuracy decays exponentially with circuit depth, resulting in negligible\nerrors for these logarithmic-depth circuits. We also establish that these codes\nare optimal, proving that logarithmic depth is necessary to maintain a constant\nencoding rate and high error correction performance. To prove our results, we\npropose new decoupling theorems for one-dimensional, low-depth circuits. These\nresults also imply the strong decoupling and rapid thermalization within\nlow-depth random circuits and have potential applications in quantum\ninformation science.",

    "abstract": "Sparse arrays with $N$-sensors can provide up to $O(N^2)$ degrees of freedom\n(DOF) by second-order cumulants. However, these sparse arrays like\nminimum-/low-redundancy arrays (MRAs/LRAs), nested arrays and coprime arrays\ncan only provide limited DOF and array aperture with the same number of\nphysical sensors. However, further increasing DOF would increase costs in\npractical applications. The paper aims to design a sparse linear array (SLA)\nwith higher DOF and lower redundancy via exploring different cases of\nthird-order cumulants. Based on the framework third-order exhaustive co-array\n(TO-ECA), a general third-order array (GTOA) with any generator is proposed in\nthe paper. Further, three novel arrays are designed based on GTOA with\ndifferent generators, namely third-order sum and difference array (generator)\n(TO-SDA(CNA)), (TO-SDA(SCNA)) and (TO-SDA(TNA-II)) which can provide\nclosed-form expressions for the sensor locations and enhance DOF in order to\nresolve more signal sources in the estimation of direction of arrival (DOA).\nThe three TO-SDAs are all consisted of two sub-arrays, where the first is the\ngenerator and another is a ULA with big inter-spacing between sensors. For the\nthree TO-SDAs, the maximum DOF under the given number of total physical sensors\ncan be derived and the TO-ECA of the three TO-SDAs are hole-free. Additionally,\nthe redundancy of the three TO-SDAs is defined, and the lower band of the\nredundancy for the three TO-SDAs is derived. Furthermore, the proposed\nTO-SDA(TNA-II) not only achieves higher DOF than those of existing TONA and\neven SE-FL-NA but also reduces mutual coupling effects. Meanwhile it realizes\nhigher resolution and decreases redundancy. Numerical simulations are conducted\nto verify the superiority of TO-SDA(TNA-II) on DOA estimation performance and\nenhanced DOF over other existing DCAs.",

Two key methodological advances are\nintroduced: (i) a generalized formulation for detector acceleration without\nassuming specific dispersion relations, and (ii) a momentum-resolved detection\nparadigm enabling spectral decomposition of $\\omega_{|\\textbf{k}|}$ through\nlocalized momentum-shell integration. Analysis of deviations reveals disruption\nof the thermal spectrum under significant departures from the Lorentz\ninvariance, while small perturbative regimes manifest as phase-modulated\nthermal distributions.

    "abstract": "LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in autonomous\ndriving. In recent years, semi-supervised methods have gained popularity due to\ntheir significant reduction in annotation labor and time costs. Current\nsemi-supervised methods typically focus on point cloud spatial distribution or\nconsider short-term temporal representations, e.g., only two adjacent frames,\noften overlooking the rich long-term temporal properties inherent in autonomous\ndriving scenarios. In driving experience, we observe that nearby objects, such\nas roads and vehicles, remain stable while driving, whereas distant objects\nexhibit greater variability in category and shape. This natural phenomenon is\nalso captured by LiDAR, which reflects lower temporal sensitivity for nearby\nobjects and higher sensitivity for distant ones. To leverage these\ncharacteristics, we propose HiLoTs, which learns high-temporal sensitivity and\nlow-temporal sensitivity representations from continuous LiDAR frames. These\nrepresentations are further enhanced and fused using a cross-attention\nmechanism. Additionally, we employ a teacher-student framework to align the\nrepresentations learned by the labeled and unlabeled branches, effectively\nutilizing the large amounts of unlabeled data. Experimental results on the\nSemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiLoTs\noutperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods, and achieves performance\nclose to LiDAR+Camera multimodal approaches.

While\nfiber-based TF-QKD implementations have advanced rapidly since its proposal,\nfree-space realizations have remained elusive due to atmospheric\nturbulence-induced phase distortions. Here, we report the first experimental\ndemonstration of free-space TF-QKD over 14.2 km urban atmospheric channels,\nsurpassing the effective atmospheric thickness -- a critical threshold for\nsatellite compatibility. We achieve a secret key rate exceeding the\nrepeaterless capacity bound, a milestone for practical quantum communication.\nOur approach eliminates the need for an auxiliary channel to stabilize a closed\ninterferometer, instead leveraging open-channel time and phase control of\noptical pulses.

    "abstract": "Migrating existing C programs into Rust is increasingly desired, as Rust\noffers superior memory safety while maintaining C's high performance. However,\nvastly different features between C and Rust--e.g., distinct definitions and\nusages of pointers and references--pose significant challenges beyond mere\nsyntactic translation. Existing automated translation tools, such as C2Rust,\nmay rely too much on syntactic, template-based translation and generate unsafe\nRust code that is hard for human developers to read, maintain, or even compile.\nMore semantic-aware translation that produces safer, idiomatic, and runnable\nRust code is much needed. This paper introduces a novel dependency-guided and\nlarge language model (LLM)-based C-to-Rust translation approach, RustMap, based\non three key ideas: (1) Utilize LLM capabilities to produce idiomatic Rust code\nfrom given small pieces of C code, (2) Mitigate LLM limitations in handling\nlarge codebases by breaking project-scale C programs into smaller units for\ntranslation according to their usage dependencies and composing them into a\nrunnable Rust program, and (3) Enhance the correctness of the translated Rust\nprogram by using test cases to check input/output equivalence, isolate faulty\ncode when execution states deviate, and iteratively refine the translation\nusing feedback from compilation and test errors. We empirically evaluate\nRustMap on 126 real-world programs, including 125 from Rosetta Code and a 7000+\nline bzip2 implementation using GPT-4o as the LLM. RustMap shows promising\nresults, guiding GPT-4o to produce idiomatic, readable, and functional Rust\ncode with significantly less unsafe code than other tools, and revealing\nnon-trivial translation patterns reusable for future research.",

    "abstract": "Recently, great progress has been made in video generation technology,\nattracting the widespread attention of scholars. To apply this technology to\ndownstream applications under resource-constrained conditions, researchers\nusually fine-tune the pre-trained models based on parameter-efficient tuning\nmethods such as Adapter or Lora. Although these methods can transfer the\nknowledge from the source domain to the target domain, fewer training\nparameters lead to poor fitting ability, and the knowledge from the source\ndomain may lead to the inference process deviating from the target domain. In\nthis paper, we argue that under constrained resources, training a smaller video\ngeneration model from scratch using only million-level samples can outperform\nparameter-efficient tuning on larger models in downstream applications: the\ncore lies in the effective utilization of data and curriculum strategy. Take\nanimated sticker generation (ASG) as a case study, we first construct a\ndiscrete frame generation network for stickers with low frame rates, ensuring\nthat its parameters meet the requirements of model training under constrained\nresources. In order to provide data support for models trained from scratch, we\ncome up with a dual-mask based data utilization strategy, which manages to\nimprove the availability and expand the diversity of limited data. To\nfacilitate convergence under dual-mask situation, we propose a\ndifficulty-adaptive curriculum learning method, which decomposes the sample\nentropy into static and adaptive components so as to obtain samples from easy\nto difficult. The experiment demonstrates that our resource-efficient dual-mask\ntraining framework is quantitatively and qualitatively superior to\nefficient-parameter tuning methods such as I2V-Adapter and SimDA, verifying the\nfeasibility of our method on downstream tasks under constrained resources.

Furthermore, a list\nof basic tools is proposed to guarantee the security, integrity, and resilience\nof these systems, and a practical case is presented, focused on the analysis of\nrobot knowledge management, where ten evaluation criteria are defined to ensure\ncompliance with the regulation and reduce risks in human-robot interaction\n(HRI) environments.",

By combining\ndc-magnetization, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon-spin rotation\n({$\\mu$SR) measurements on high-quality V$_2$Ga$_5$ single crystals, we\ninvestigate the electronic properties of its normal- and superconducting (SC)\nground states. NMR measurements in the normal state indicate a strong\nanisotropy in both the line shifts and the relaxation rates. Such anisotropy\npersists also in the superconducting state, as shown by the magnetization- and\n$\\mu$SR-spectroscopy results. In the latter case, data collected at different\ntemperatures, pressures, and directions of the magnetic field evidence a\nfully-gapped, strongly anisotropic superconductivity. At the same time,\nhydrostatic pressure is shown to only lower the $T_c$ value, but not to change\nthe superfluid density nor its temperature dependence. Lastly, we discuss the\nsearch for topological signatures in the normal state of V$_2$Ga$_5$, as well\nas a peak splitting in the FFT of the $\\mu$SR spectrum, possibly related to an\nunconventional vortex lattice. Our results suggest that V$_2$Ga$_5$ is a novel\nsystem, whose anisotropy plays a key role in determining its unusual electronic\nproperties.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models spurred research on\npersonalization, i.e., a customized image synthesis, of subjects within\nreference images. Although existing personalization methods are able to alter\nthe subjects' positions or to personalize multiple subjects simultaneously,\nthey often struggle to modify the behaviors of subjects or their dynamic\ninteractions. The difficulty is attributable to overfitting to reference\nimages, which worsens if only a single reference image is available. We propose\nDynASyn, an effective multi-subject personalization from a single reference\nimage addressing these challenges. DynASyn preserves the subject identity in\nthe personalization process by aligning concept-based priors with subject\nappearances and actions. This is achieved by regularizing the attention maps\nbetween the subject token and images through concept-based priors. In addition,\nwe propose concept-based prompt-and-image augmentation for an enhanced\ntrade-off between identity preservation and action diversity. We adopt an\nSDE-based editing guided by augmented prompts to generate diverse appearances\nand actions while maintaining identity consistency in the augmented images.\nExperiments show that DynASyn is capable of synthesizing highly realistic\nimages of subjects with novel contexts and dynamic interactions with the\nsurroundings, and outperforms baseline methods in both quantitative and\nqualitative aspects.",

For each comet, we obtain\nthe osculation orbits from the available observations. We then construct swarms\nof virtual comets as the basis for all dynamical studies.

We\nfound that both these HTCs reach the sungrazing states due to Kozai resonances\nwith other planets than Jupiter; for example, Uranus acts as the agent of Kozai\nresonance for 161P. We indicate that the high sungrazing probability for both\ncomets is connected with a high likelihood of orbit flipping. The other four\nHTCs have a slight chance to be sungrazers after 100 kyr (<2.2%); however,\nthree of them can achieve a high flipping probability. We show that the\nLyapunov time and MEGNO indicator give a complementary picture of the orbital\nstability after 10,000 yr.

However, current backdoor samples often exhibit two key abnormalities\ncompared to benign samples: 1) Semantic Consistency, where backdoor prompts\ntend to generate images with similar semantic content even with significant\ntextual variations to the prompts; 2) Attention Consistency, where the trigger\ninduces consistent structural responses in the cross-attention maps. These\nconsistencies leave detectable traces for defenders, making backdoors easier to\nidentify. In this paper, toward stealthy backdoor samples, we propose Trigger\nwithout Trace (TwT) by explicitly mitigating these consistencies. Specifically,\nour approach leverages syntactic structures as backdoor triggers to amplify the\nsensitivity to textual variations, effectively breaking down the semantic\nconsistency. Besides, a regularization method based on Kernel Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy (KMMD) is proposed to align the distribution of cross-attention\nresponses between backdoor and benign samples, thereby disrupting attention\nconsistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 97.5%\nattack success rate while exhibiting stronger resistance to defenses. It\nachieves an average of over 98% backdoor samples bypassing three\nstate-of-the-art detection mechanisms, revealing the vulnerabilities of current\nbackdoor defense methods.

Recognizing that WMMSE beamforming is\na highly effective method for maximizing the MU-MIMO sum rate, we modify it to\nintegrate antenna position optimization for MA systems, which we refer to as\nflexible WMMSE (F-WMMSE) beamforming. Importantly, we reformulate the\nsubproblems within WMMSE to develop regularized sparse optimization frameworks\nto achieve joint beamforming (antenna coefficient optimization) and element\nmovement (antenna position optimization).

In this paper, we discuss the aforementioned problem from a new\nperspective: Can we regularize OSR models without elaborately selecting\nauxiliary known outliers? We first empirically and theoretically explore the\nrole of foregrounds and backgrounds in open set recognition and disclose that:\n1) backgrounds that correlate with foregrounds would mislead the model and\ncause failures when encounters 'partially' known images; 2) Backgrounds\nunrelated to foregrounds can serve as auxiliary known outliers and provide\nregularization via global average pooling. Based on the above insights, we\npropose a new method, Background Mix (BackMix), that mixes the foreground of an\nimage with different backgrounds to remove the underlying fore-background\npriors. Specifically, BackMix first estimates the foreground with class\nactivation maps (CAMs), then randomly replaces image patches with backgrounds\nfrom other images to obtain mixed images for training. With backgrounds\nde-correlated from foregrounds, the open set recognition performance is\nsignificantly improved. The proposed method is quite simple to implement,\nrequires no extra operation for inferences, and can be seamlessly integrated\ninto almost all of the existing frameworks.

However, most\nexisting perching methods adopt either an upward or downward approach, making\nit difficult to perch near walls with surrounding obstacles. Additionally,\nperching hands are typically designed solely for attachment to objects and lack\nadditional functionality, imposing a payload burden during flight. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes a lightweight robotic hand, the \"Tri-force\nhand\", capable of both perching and object grasping, as well as a new perching\nmethod called \"Pendulum-perching\". The Tri-force hand is a tendon-driven,\nthree-fingered hand utilizing a spherical joint and a two-dimensional\ndifferential plate, enabling passive actuation with a single actuator. Each\nfinger module, designed with controllable semi-tendon drive, can conform to\narbitrary shapes within its operating range, allowing both perching and\nadaptive object grasping. By integrating this hand into a fully actuated aerial\nrobot, the system can perform multi-directional approaches from the side and\nlanding using gravity. This approach is similar to Crush-perching seen in\nresearches with fixed-wing aerial robots, but it differs in its superior\ncontrol over approach speed and direction, as well as its ability to achieve\nstable detachment and re-launch. In experiments, the fabricated Tri-force hand\ndemonstrated the ability to withstand a total weight of up to 27.5 kg, grasp\nvarious objects ranging from simple to complex-shaped tools, and achieve a high\nsuccess rate in both perching and takeoff.",

In order to discuss sustainable\nAI this article draws from insights by critical data and algorithm studies,\nSTS, transformative sustainability science, critical computer science, and\npublic interest theory. I argue that while there are indeed many\nsustainability-related use cases for AI, they are likely to have more overall\ndrawbacks than benefits. To substantiate this claim, I differentiate three 'AI\nmaterialities' of the AI supply chain: first the literal materiality (e.g.\nwater, cobalt, lithium, energy consumption etc.), second, the informational\nmateriality (e.g. lots of data and centralised control necessary), and third,\nthe social materiality (e.g. exploitative data work, communities harm by waste\nand pollution). In all materialities, effects are especially devastating for\nthe global south while benefiting the global north. A second strong claim\nregarding sustainable AI circles around so called apolitical optimisation (e.g.\nregarding city traffic), however the optimisation criteria (e.g. cars, bikes,\nemissions, commute time, health) are purely political and have to be\ncollectively negotiated before applying AI optimisation. Hence, sustainable AI,\nin principle, cannot break the glass ceiling of transformation and might even\ndistract from necessary societal change.

While some physics-based\ngenerative methods have attempted to implement motion editing, they typically\noperate on single-view images with simple motions, such as translation and\ndragging.

Using tree-based machine learning algorithms - Random Forest\n(RF), XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM - we developed FDD models to classify six\ncommon faults in a laboratory-scale CO2-RS. The Recursive Feature Addition\n(RFA) approach identified optimal sensor sets, achieving a 99% F1-score with\nminimal sensors: four for RF, seven for XGBoost, five for CatBoost, and five\nfor LightGBM. Condenser-side sensors consistently ranked as critical for fault\ndetection. Robustness was assessed by injecting Additive White Gaussian Noise\n(AWGN) at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 3 dB into the most important sensor,\nwith XGBoost showing superior resilience at 85.24%, followed by CatBoost\n(57.07%), LightGBM (49.1%), and RF (49.46%).

    "abstract": "The trajectory of intelligence evolution is often framed around the emergence\nof artificial general intelligence (AGI) and its alignment with human values.\nThis paper challenges that framing by introducing the concept of intelligence\nsequencing: the idea that the order in which AGI and decentralized collective\nintelligence (DCI) emerge determines the long-term attractor basin of\nintelligence. Using insights from dynamical systems, evolutionary game theory,\nand network models, it argues that intelligence follows a path-dependent,\nirreversible trajectory. Once development enters a centralized (AGI-first) or\ndecentralized (DCI-first) regime, transitions become structurally infeasible\ndue to feedback loops and resource lock-in. Intelligence attractors are modeled\nin functional state space as the co-navigation of conceptual and adaptive\nfitness spaces. Early-phase structuring constrains later dynamics, much like\nrenormalization in physics. This has major implications for AI safety:\ntraditional alignment assumes AGI will emerge and must be controlled after the\nfact, but this paper argues that intelligence sequencing is more foundational.\nIf AGI-first architectures dominate before DCI reaches critical mass,\nhierarchical monopolization and existential risk become locked in. If DCI-first\nemerges, intelligence stabilizes around decentralized cooperative equilibrium.\nThe paper further explores whether intelligence structurally biases itself\ntoward an attractor based on its self-modeling method -- externally imposed\naxioms (favoring AGI) vs. recursive internal visualization (favoring DCI).\nFinally, it proposes methods to test this theory via simulations, historical\nlock-in case studies, and intelligence network analysis.

In 1990,\nAlbertson, Berman, Hutchinson, and Thomassen showed that every connected graph\nof order $n$ with $\\delta(G)\\geq \\min\\{\\frac n 2, 4\\sqrt{2n}\\}$ contains a\nHIST.\n  We show that every complete bipartite graph with both parts being even has no\nodd spanning tree, thereby for any even integer $n$ divisible by 4, there\nexists a graph of order $n$ with the minimum degree $\\frac n 2$ having no odd\nspanning tree. Furthermore, we show that every graph of order $n$ with\n$\\delta(G)\\geq \\frac n 2 +1$ has an odd spanning tree. We also characterize all\nsplit graphs having an odd spanning tree. As an application, for any graph $G$\nwith diameter at least 4, $\\overline{G}$ has a spanning odd double star.\nFinally, we also give a necessary and sufficient condition for a triangle-free\ngraph $G$ whose complement contains an odd spanning tree. A number of related\nopen problems are proposed.",

Unfortunately, directly optimizing for long-term\nobjectives is challenging, and we identify the disconnect in the timescales of\nshort-term interventions (e.g., rankings) and the long-term feedback (e.g.,\nuser retention) as one of the key obstacles. To overcome this disconnect, we\nintroduce the framework of MultiScale Policy Learning to contextually reconcile\nthat AI systems need to act and optimize feedback at multiple interdependent\ntimescales.

It consists of two phases:\nthe Initial Generation Phase, which creates base images based on user prompts,\nand the Interactive Refinement Phase, which integrates user feedback through\nthree key modules. The Dialogue-to-Prompt (D2P) module ensures that user\nfeedback is effectively transformed into actionable prompts, which improves the\nalignment between user intent and model input.

    "abstract": "The breaking of the Lam-Tung relation in the Drell-Yan process at the LHC\nexhibits a long-standing tension with the Standard Model (SM) prediction at\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^3)$ accuracy. This tension could be explained by weak\ndipole interactions of leptons and quarks, associated with the $Z$-boson within\nthe framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). In this\npaper, we propose to cross-check these weak dipole interactions by measuring\nthe violation effects of the Lam-Tung relation at future lepton colliders\nthrough the processes $e^+e^- \\to Z\\gamma \\to \\ell\\bar{\\ell}\\gamma$ and $e^+e^-\n\\to Z\\gamma \\to q\\bar{q}\\gamma$. By considering different decay modes of the\n$Z$-boson, these channels exhibit distinct sensitivities to various dipole\noperators, providing a way to disentangle their individual effects.\nAdditionally, the high flavor-tagging efficiencies at lepton colliders could\nprovide strong constraints on the dipole interactions of heavy quarks, such as\n$b$ and $c$ quarks, which are challenging to probe in the Drell-Yan process at\nthe LHC due to the suppression of parton distribution functions.",

    "abstract": "Detecting maximal square submatrices of ones in binary matrices is a\nfundamental problem with applications in computer vision and pattern\nrecognition. While the standard dynamic programming (DP) solution achieves\noptimal asymptotic complexity, its practical performance suffers from repeated\nminimum operations and inefficient memory access patterns that degrade cache\nutilization. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel frequency-based\nalgorithm that employs a greedy approach to track the columnar continuity of\nones through an adaptive frequency array and a dynamic thresholding mechanism.\nExtensive benchmarking demonstrates that the frequency-based algorithm achieves\nfaster performance than the standard DP in 100% of test cases with an average\nspeedup of 3.32x, a maximum speedup of 4.60x, and a minimum speedup of 2.31x\nacross matrices up to 5000x5000 with densities from 0.1 to 0.9. The algorithm's\naverage speedup exceeds 2.5x for all densities and rises to over 3.5x for\ndensities of 0.7 and higher across all matrix sizes. These results demonstrate\nthat the frequency-based approach is a superior alternative to standard DP and\nopens new possibilities for efficient matrix analysis in performance-critical\napplications.",

To address\nthis, we represent the Brownian motion using the Karhunen-Lo\\`eve expansion,\ntruncating it to a limited number of eigenfunctions. We propose a novel\nordinary differential equation with augmented random initials, termed KL\ndiffusion, as a new forward-time process for training and sampling. By\ndeveloping an appropriate denoising loss function, we facilitate the\nintegration of our KL-diffusion into existing denoising-based models. Using the\nwidely adopted DDIM framework as our baseline ensures a fair comparison, as our\nmodifications focus solely on the forward process and loss function, leaving\nthe network architecture and sampling methods unchanged. Our method\nsignificantly outperforms baseline diffusion models, achieving convergence\nspeeds that are twice faster to reach the best FID score of the baseline and\nultimately yielding much lower FID scores. Notably, our approach allows for\nhighly parallelized computation, requires no additional learnable parameters,\nand can be flexibly integrated into existing diffusion methods.

We detected six thermonuclear X-ray bursts during the\nNICER and NuSTAR observations, with the observed X-ray burst profiles\nexhibiting a strong energy dependence. The time-resolved burst spectra indicate\nthe presence of soft excess during the burst, which can be modeled by using a\nvariable persistent emission method ($f_a$ method), or the relxillNS reflection\nmodel. We found that the reflection model can contribute $\\sim$20% of total\nemission as observed during the NICER burst. The reflection and blackbody\ncomponent fluxes are strongly correlated as observed during a burst. The excess\nemission is possible due to the enhanced mass accretion rate to the neutron\nstar due to the Poynting-Rodertson drag and a fraction of burst emission may be\nreflected from the disk. The bursts did not show photospheric radius expansion\nduring the peak. Moreover, we examined the burst-free accretion emission in the\nbroadband range with NuSTAR, NICER, and Swift at two epochs of the outburst.\nThe persistent emission showed X-ray reflection feature, which can be well\nmodeled with the relativistic reflection model relxillCp. The inner disk radius\n(R$_{in}$) is found to be nearly 22 and 10 times $\\rm R_{g}$ for two\nobservations, respectively.

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for\nadapting large vision transformers to downstream tasks without the prohibitive\ncomputational costs of full fine-tuning. While existing visual prompt tuning\n(VPT) methods have made significant strides, they predominantly rely on static,\ndomain-specific prompts that fail to capture the rich visual diversity within\nindividual instances. This paper introduces V$^2$APT (Visual Variational\nAutoencoder Prompt Tuning), a novel framework that generates dynamic,\ninput-dependent prompts using a variational autoencoder architecture. By\nlearning a latent representation of image-specific features and decoding them\ninto customized prompts, V$^2$APT adapts to the unique visual characteristics\nof each input. Extensive experiments on FGVC, HTA, and VTAB-1k benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT\nmethods. Notably, V$^2$APT achieves +3.2\\% improvement over VPT-Deep on HTA,\nwith an average performance gain of +2.0\\% across all three datasets.",

    "abstract": "Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has recently emerged as a pivotal\ntechnique for communication-efficient federated learning (FL) in\nresource-constrained wireless networks. Though AirComp leverages the\nsuperposition property of multiple access channels for computation, it\ninherently limits its ability to manage inter-task interference in multi-task\ncomputing. In this paper, we propose a quantized analog beamforming scheme at\nthe receiver to enable simultaneous multi-task FL. Specifically, inspiring by\nthe favorable propagation and channel hardening properties of large-scale\nantenna arrays, a targeted analog beamforming method in closed form is proposed\nfor statistical interference elimination. Analytical results reveal that the\ninterference power vanishes by an order of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(1/N_r\\right)$ with\nthe number of analog phase shifters, $N_r$, irrespective of their quantization\nprecision. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nanalog beamforming method and show that the performance upper bound of ideal\nlearning without errors can be achieved by increasing the number of\nlow-precision analog phase shifters.",

    "abstract": "Background: Lung disease is a significant health issue, particularly in\nchildren and elderly individuals. It often results from lung infections and is\none of the leading causes of mortality in children. Globally, lung-related\ndiseases claim many lives each year, making early and accurate diagnoses\ncrucial. Radiographs are valuable tools for the diagnosis of such conditions.\nThe most prevalent lung diseases, including pneumonia, asthma, allergies,\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema, and lung\ncancer, represent significant public health challenges. Early prediction of\nthese conditions is critical, as it allows for the identification of risk\nfactors and implementation of preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of\ndisease onset\n  Methods: In this study, we utilized a dataset comprising 3,475 chest X-ray\nimages sourced from from Mendeley Data provided by Talukder, M. A. (2023) [14],\ncategorized into three classes: normal, lung opacity, and pneumonia. We applied\nfive pre-trained deep learning models, including CNN, ResNet50, DenseNet,\nCheXNet, and U-Net, as well as two transfer learning algorithms such as Vision\nTransformer (ViT) and Shifted Window (Swin) to classify these images. This\napproach aims to address diagnostic issues in lung abnormalities by reducing\nreliance on human intervention through automated classification systems. Our\nanalysis was conducted in both binary and multiclass settings. Results: In the\nbinary classification, we focused on distinguishing between normal and viral\npneumonia cases, whereas in the multi-class classification, all three classes\n(normal, lung opacity, and viral pneumonia) were included. Our proposed\nmethodology (ViT) achieved remarkable performance, with accuracy rates of 99%\nfor binary classification and 95.25% for multiclass classification.",

Unfortunately, recent perturbative analysis in the background of\nmaximally symmetric space-time revealed that GSTG also suffers from the strong\ncoupling issue and the ghost degrees of freedom. It has also been cognised that\nGSTG does not admit diffeomorphic invariance in general. Lately, it has been\nshown that except for the first, the other two connections associated with\nspatially flat Robertson-Walker metric do not even admit GSTG, while the first\nconnection leads to an eerie Hamiltonian upon ensuing Dirac-Bergmann constraint\nanalysis. Here we show that the only existing non-flat connection is also not\nviable in the same sense. Thus GSTG happens to be jeopardized. These problems\ndo not showup in $f(R,Q)$ theory of gravity. Modified Dirac-Bergmann constraint\nanalysis is deployed to formulate the phase-space structure.

    "abstract": "Crowd monitoring in sports stadiums is important to enhance public safety and\nimprove the audience experience. Existing approaches mainly rely on cameras and\nmicrophones, which can cause significant disturbances and often raise privacy\nconcerns. In this paper, we sense floor vibration, which provides a less\ndisruptive and more non-intrusive way of crowd sensing, to predict crowd\nbehavior. However, since the vibration-based crowd monitoring approach is newly\ndeveloped, one main challenge is the lack of training data due to sports\nstadiums being large public spaces with complex physical activities.\n  In this paper, we present ViLA (Vibration Leverage Audio), a vibration-based\nmethod that reduces the dependency on labeled data by pre-training with\nunlabeled cross-modality data. ViLA is first pre-trained on audio data in an\nunsupervised manner and then fine-tuned with a minimal amount of in-domain\nvibration data. By leveraging publicly available audio datasets, ViLA learns\nthe wave behaviors from audio and then adapts the representation to vibration,\nreducing the reliance on domain-specific vibration data. Our real-world\nexperiments demonstrate that pre-training the vibration model using publicly\navailable audio data (YouTube8M) achieved up to a 5.8x error reduction compared\nto the model without audio pre-training.",

These\nexponents are fundamentally linked to the system's behavior near the critical\nend point (CEP), making precise localization of the CEP essential. However,\nprecisely identifying the CEP within the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence\npresents considerable challenges. In this study, we explore critical phenomena\nand critical exponents within a holographic QCD model. We achieve\nhigh-precision calculations of the CEP's position and dynamically analyze the\nbehavior of the critical exponent as it approaches the CEP using limiting\nmethods. Our results indicate that linear fitting is only appropriate in\nregions very close to the CEP. Furthermore, we find that although the values of\nthe critical exponents vary when approaching the CEP from different directions,\nthey ultimately converge to a single fixed value, revealing a universal\nbehavior among these exponents. Our research underscores the importance of\nprecisely determining the CEP, selecting the fitting region, and considering\nthe direction of the approach when predicting critical exponents.

An important component of the\nPAA is risk diversification to reduce the randomness of policies. A second\ncomponent emulates model averaging from statistics. A third component involves\nusing cross-validation to diversify and optimize weights among candidate\npolicies. We demonstrate the use of the PAA for the newsvendor problem. For\nthat problem, model-based approaches typically use specific and potentially\nunreliable assumptions of either independently and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.) demand or feature-dependent demand with covariates or autoregressive\nfunctions. Data-driven approaches, including sample averaging and the use of\nfunctions of covariates to set order quantities, typically suffer from\noverfitting and provide limited insights to justify recommended policies. By\nintegrating concepts from statistics and finance, the PAA avoids these\nproblems. We show using theoretical analysis, a simulation study, and an\nempirical study, that the PAA outperforms all those earlier approaches. The\ndemonstrated benefits of the PAA include reduced expected cost, more stable\nperformance, and improved insights to justify recommendations. Extensions to\nconsider tail risk and the use of stratified sampling are discussed.

We further investigate\nspecial cases in which the external fields do always have the same sign.\n  The first example is the Potts model with general external fields on random\n$d$-regular graphs.

    "abstract": "This study finds that existing information retrieval (IR) models show\nsignificant biases based on the linguistic complexity of input queries,\nperforming well on linguistically simpler (or more complex) queries while\nunderperforming on linguistically more complex (or simpler) queries. To address\nthis issue, we propose EqualizeIR, a framework to mitigate linguistic biases in\nIR models. EqualizeIR uses a linguistically biased weak learner to capture\nlinguistic biases in IR datasets and then trains a robust model by regularizing\nand refining its predictions using the biased weak learner. This approach\neffectively prevents the robust model from overfitting to specific linguistic\npatterns in data. We propose four approaches for developing\nlinguistically-biased models. Extensive experiments on several datasets show\nthat our method reduces performance disparities across linguistically simple\nand complex queries, while improving overall retrieval performance.",

In our approach\nwe set up an initial boundary value problem on a finite boundary, which cleanly\nseparates the initial conditions, a static black hole, from the perturbation,\nan incoming gravitational wave specified by a spin-2 function on the time-like\nboundary. The main advantage of this approach is that the finite boundary\nexpands fast enough to reach null-infinity where the asymptotic properties can\nbe studied. This provides, for the first time, a direct relationship between\nfinite initial and boundary data and asymptotic quantities within one\nsimulation.

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely employed across various domains,\nincluding safety-critical systems, necessitating comprehensive testing to\nensure their reliability. Although numerous DNN model testing methods have been\nproposed to generate adversarial samples that are capable of revealing faults,\nexisting methods typically perturb samples in the input space and then mutate\nthese based on feedback from the DNN model. These methods often result in test\nsamples that are not realistic and with low-probability reveal faults. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a black-box DNN test input generation\nmethod, ARGUS, to generate realistic, diverse, and fault-revealing test inputs.\nARGUS first compresses samples into a continuous latent space and then perturbs\nthe original samples by interpolating these with samples of different classes.\nSubsequently, we employ a vector quantizer and decoder to reconstruct\nadversarial samples back into the input space. Additionally, we employ\ndiscriminators both in the latent space and in the input space to ensure the\nrealism of the generated samples. Evaluation of ARGUS in comparison with\nstate-of-the-art black-box testing and white-box testing methods, shows that\nARGUS excels in generating realistic and diverse adversarial samples relative\nto the target dataset, and ARGUS successfully perturbs all original samples and\nachieves up to 4 times higher error rate than the best baseline method.\nFurthermore, using these adversarial samples for model retraining can improve\nmodel classification accuracy.",

Using data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System\n(FARS), the study applies machine learning techniques-including Decision Trees,\nGradient Boosting Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost-to predict contributing\nfactors to pedestrian fatalities. To address data imbalance, the Synthetic\nMinority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is utilized, while SHapley Additive\nExplanations (SHAP) values enhance model interpretability.

    "abstract": "The dynamics of magnetic fields in the Sun's active regions plays a key role\nin triggering solar eruptions. Studies have shown that changes in the\nphotosphere's magnetic field can destabilize large-scale structure of the\ncorona, leading to explosive events such as flares and coronal mass ejections\n(CMEs). This paper delves into the magnetic field evolution associated with a\npowerful X1.6 class flare that erupted on October 22nd, 2014, from the\nflare-rich active region NOAA 12192. We utilized high-resolution vector\nmagnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on NASA's Solar\nDynamic Observatory (SDO) to track these changes. Our analysis reveals that a\nbrightening, a precursor to the flare, began near the newly emerged,\nsmall-scale bipolar flux regions. During the X1.6 flare, the magnetic flux in\nboth polarities displayed emergence and cancellation. The total current within\nthe active region peaked during the flare. But, it is a non CME event and the\nratio of direct to return current value remain close to 1. The large flare in\nthis active region occured when the net current in both polarities attain the\nsame sign. This implies that the Lorentz force, a consequence of the\ninteraction between currents and magnetic fields, would have pushed the field\nlines together in this scenario. This reconnection of opposing magnetic fields\nis believed to be the driving force behind major flare occurred in this active\nregion.",

Particularly, both of them show an intriguing preference for\nextending emission line regions (EELRs), which are indicative of recently faded\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs). This further suggests that QPEs might be\nproduced following TDEs involving supermassive black holes at a particular\nstage, when the AGN activity has recently ceased. Moreover, in the framework of\n\"QPEs=extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) + accretion disk\" model, a large\nfraction of QPE EMRIs are inferred to be quasi-circular from the QPE timing,\nindicating that they are wet EMRIs that were formed in the AGN disk during a\nprevious AGN phase. Based on these facts, we propose a unified scenario that\nconnects these three phenomena: AGN activities boost both the TDE rate and the\nformation rate of low-eccentricity EMRIs, consequently TDEs are preferentially\nfound in recently faded AGNs instead of in ongoing AGNs due to selection\neffects, and QPEs are also preferentially found in recently faded AGNs where\nTDEs frequently feed a misaligned accretion disk to the EMRI.",

In this work,\nwe introduce OmniScience, a specialized large reasoning model for general\nscience, developed through three key components: (1) domain adaptive\npretraining on a carefully curated corpus of scientific literature, (2)\ninstruction tuning on a specialized dataset to guide the model in following\ndomain-specific tasks, and (3) reasoning-based knowledge distillation through\nfine-tuning to significantly enhance its ability to generate contextually\nrelevant and logically sound responses. We demonstrate the versatility of\nOmniScience by developing a battery agent that efficiently ranks molecules as\npotential electrolyte solvents or additives. Comprehensive evaluations reveal\nthat OmniScience is competitive with state-of-the-art large reasoning models on\nthe GPQA Diamond and domain-specific battery benchmarks, while outperforming\nall public reasoning and non-reasoning models with similar parameter counts.

This paper\npresents a new caching system for improving user experiences with LLMs. In\naddition to reducing both latencies and monetary costs for accessing LLMs, our\nsystem also provides important features that go beyond the performance benefits\ntypically associated with caches. A key feature we provide is generative\ncaching, wherein multiple cached responses can be synthesized to provide\nanswers to queries which have never been seen before. Our generative caches\nfunction as repositories of valuable information which can be mined and\nanalyzed.

    "abstract": "Modern day applications have grown in size and require more computational\npower. The rise of machine learning and AI increased the need for parallel\ncomputation, which has increased the need for GPGPUs. With the increasing\ndemand for computational power, GPGPUs' SIMT architecture has solved this with\nan increase in the number of threads and the number of cores in a GPU,\nincreasing the throughput of these processors to match the demand of the\napplications. However, this created a larger demand for the memory, making the\nmemory bandwidth a bottleneck. The introduction of High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM)\nwith its increased number of memory ports offers a potential solution for the\nGPU to exploit its memory parallelism to increase the memory bandwidth.\nHowever, effectively leveraging HBM's memory parallelism to maximize bandwidth\npresents a unique and complex challenge for GPU architectures on how to\ndistribute those ports among the streaming multiprocessors in the GPGPU. In\nthis work, we extend the Vortex OpenGPU microarchitecture to incorporate a\nmultiport memory hierarchy, spanning from the L1 cache to the last-level cache\n(LLC). In addition, we propose various arbitration strategies to optimize\nmemory transfers across the cache hierarchy.

A destructive interference effect caused by\nthe phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase\nbetween ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter\ncorrelation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation\nlength along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in\n$D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of\nvortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction.\nWe derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity,\nBerry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG\nequations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are\nanomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality\nmapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field,\nwe also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D\nBerry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder\nphases.",

    "abstract": "In everyday life, we frequently make coarse-grained judgments.

Similarly, when we claim that a\nparticular automobile manufacturer produces high-quality cars, we overlook the\nminor variations among individual vehicles. These coarse-grained assessments\nare distinct from erroneous or deceptive judgments, such as those resulting\nfrom student cheating or false advertising by corporations. Despite the\nprevalence of such judgments, little attention has been given to their\nunderlying mathematical structure. In this paper, we introduce the concept of\ncoarse-graining into game theory, analyzing games where players may perceive\ndifferent payoffs as identical while preserving the underlying order structure.\nWe call it a Coarse-Grained Game (CGG). This framework allows us to examine the\nrational inference processes that arise when players equate distinct\nmicro-level payoffs at a macro level, and to explore how Nash equilibria are\npreserved or altered as a result. Our key findings suggest that CGGs possess\nseveral desirable properties that make them suitable for modeling phenomena in\nthe social sciences. This paper demonstrates two such applications: first, in\ncases of overly minor product updates, consumers may encounter an equilibrium\nselection problem, resulting in market behavior that is not driven by objective\nquality differences; second, the lemon market can be analyzed not only through\nobjective information asymmetry but also through asymmetries in perceptual\nresolution or recognition ability.",

    "abstract": "This paper extends first-order motion planners to robots governed by\nsecond-order dynamics. Two control schemes are proposed based on the knowledge\nof a scalar function whose negative gradient aligns with a given first-order\nmotion planner. When such a function is known, the first-order motion planner\nis combined with a damping velocity vector with a dynamic gain to extend the\nsafety and convergence guarantees of the first-order motion planner to\nsecond-order systems. If no such function is available, we propose an\nalternative control scheme ensuring that the error between the robot's velocity\nand the first-order motion planner converges to zero. The theoretical\ndevelopments are supported by simulation results demonstrating the\neffectiveness of the proposed approaches.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic analysis, through rehosting, is an important capability for security\nassessment in embedded systems software. Existing rehosting techniques aim to\nprovide high-fidelity execution by accurately emulating hardware and peripheral\ninteractions. However, these techniques face challenges in adoption due to the\nincreasing number of available peripherals and the complexities involved in\ndesigning emulation models for diverse hardware. Additionally, contrary to the\nprevailing belief that guides existing works, our analysis of reported bugs\nshows that high-fidelity execution is not required to expose most bugs in\nembedded software. Our key hypothesis is that security vulnerabilities are more\nlikely to arise at higher abstraction levels. To substantiate our hypothesis,\nwe introduce LEMIX, a framework enabling dynamic analysis of embedded\napplications by rehosting them as x86 Linux applications decoupled from\nhardware dependencies. Enabling embedded applications to run natively on Linux\nfacilitates security analysis using available techniques and takes advantage of\nthe powerful hardware available on the Linux platform for higher testing\nthroughput. We develop various techniques to address the challenges involved in\nconverting embedded applications to Linux applications. We evaluated LEMIX on\n18 real-world embedded applications across four RTOSes and found 21 new bugs in\n12 of the applications and all 4 of the RTOS kernels. We report that LEMIX is\nsuperior to existing state-of-the-art techniques both in terms of code coverage\n(~2x more coverage) and bug detection (18 more bugs).",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) integrating explicit\nreasoning, such as OpenAI's o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and QWQ-32B, enable smaller\nmodels to solve complex tasks by generating intermediate reasoning steps prior\nto providing answers. However, this approach significantly increases\ncomputational costs, both monetarily and environmentally. The widely-used\nself-consistency method further exacerbates these costs by aggregating multiple\nreasoning paths to improve accuracy, often requiring between 40 to 64 samples\nper task. Although aggregation effectively reduces variance and bias,\nadditional sampling can lead to diminishing returns when early samples yield\nconsistent results. To address inefficiencies, we propose leveraging Sequential\nProbability Ratio Testing (SPRT) to dynamically terminate sampling once\nsufficient consistency is achieved. We calibrate SPRT parameters specifically\nfor LLM applications, accounting for sensitivity to detect the mode of the\ndistribution. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating SPRT significantly\nenhances token efficiency, achieving comparable accuracy to self-consistency\nmethods but at a substantially reduced computational cost. To promote\ntransparency and facilitate reproducibility, we have made the source code and\ndatasets used in our experiments publicly available at our GitHub repository:\nhttps://github.com/LiuzLab/consol, or available as a PyPI package: pip install\nconsol. We hope that this resource will support further research and encourage\nthe development of new methods building upon our work.",

We find that PBH accretion is self-regulated by feedback, suppressing\nmass growth unless feedback is weak. PBHs accelerate structure formation by\nseeding dark matter halos and gravitationally attracting gas, but strong\nfeedback can delay cooling and suppress star formation. In addition, the\npresence of baryon-dark matter streaming creates an offset between the PBH\nlocation and the peaks induced in gas density, promoting earlier and more\nefficient star formation compared to standard $\\Lambda$CDM. By $z \\sim 10$,\nPBH-seeded galaxies form dense star clusters, with PBH-to-stellar mass ratios\ncomparable to observed high-$z$ AGN like UHZ-1. Our results support PBHs as\nviable SMBH seeds but do not exclude alternative scenarios. We emphasize that\nPBH-seeding provides a natural explanation for some of the newly-discovered\novermassive SMBHs at high redshift, in particular those with extreme ratios of\nBH-to-dynamical (virial) mass that challenge standard formation channels.\nFuture studies with ultra-deep JWST surveys, the Roman Space Telescope, and\nradio surveys with facilities such as SKA and HERA will be critical in\ndistinguishing PBH-driven SMBH growth from other pathways.",
