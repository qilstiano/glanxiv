    "abstract": "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classical NP-hard problem that\nplays a crucial role in combinatorial optimization. In this paper, we are\ninterested in the quantum search framework for the TSP because it has robust\ntheoretical guarantees. However, we need to first search for all Hamiltonian\ncycles from a very large solution space, which greatly weakens the advantage of\nquantum search algorithms. To address this issue, one can first prepare a\nsuperposition state of all feasible solutions, and then amplify the amplitude\nof the optimal solution from it. We propose a quantum algorithm to generate the\nuniform superposition state of all N-length Hamiltonian cycles as an initial\nstate within polynomial gate complexity based on pure quantum dynamic\nprogramming with very few ancillary qubits, which achieves exponential\nacceleration compared to the previous initial state preparation algorithm. As a\nresult, we realized the theoretical minimum query complexity of quantum search\nalgorithms for a general TSP. Compared to some algorithms that theoretically\nhave lower query complexities but lack practical implementation solutions, our\nalgorithm has feasible circuit implementation. Our work provides a meaningful\nresearch case on how to fully utilize the structures of specific problems to\nunleash the acceleration capability of the quantum search algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Legal reform can be challenging in light of the volume, complexity, and\ninterdependence of laws, codes, and records. One salient example of this\nchallenge is the effort to restrict and remove racially restrictive covenants,\nclauses in property deeds that historically barred individuals of specific\nraces from purchasing homes. Despite the Supreme Court holding such racial\ncovenants unenforceable in 1948, they persist in property records across the\nUnited States. Many jurisdictions have moved to identify and strike these\nprovisions, including California, which mandated in 2021 that all counties\nimplement such a process. Yet the scale can be overwhelming, with Santa Clara\nCounty (SCC) alone having over 24 million property deed documents, making\npurely manual review infeasible. We present a novel approach to addressing this\npressing issue, developed through a partnership with the SCC Clerk-Recorder's\nOffice. First, we leverage an open large language model, finetuned to detect\nracial covenants with high precision and recall. We estimate that this system\nreduces manual efforts by 86,500 person hours and costs less than 2% of the\ncost for a comparable off-the-shelf closed model. Second, we illustrate the\nCounty's integration of this model into responsible operational practice,\nincluding legal review and the creation of a historical registry, and release\nour model to assist the hundreds of jurisdictions engaged in similar efforts.\nFinally, our results reveal distinct periods of utilization of racial\ncovenants, sharp geographic clustering, and the disproportionate role of a\nsmall number of developers in maintaining housing discrimination. We estimate\nthat by 1950, one in four properties across the County were subject to racial\ncovenants.",

    "abstract": "This thesis investigates dataset downsampling as a strategy to optimize\nenergy efficiency in recommender systems while maintaining competitive\nperformance. With increasing dataset sizes posing computational and\nenvironmental challenges, this study explores the trade-offs between energy\nefficiency and recommendation quality in Green Recommender Systems, which aim\nto reduce environmental impact. By applying two downsampling approaches to\nseven datasets, 12 algorithms, and two levels of core pruning, the research\ndemonstrates significant reductions in runtime and carbon emissions. For\nexample, a 30% downsampling portion can reduce runtime by 52% compared to the\nfull dataset, leading to a carbon emission reduction of up to 51.02 KgCO2e\nduring the training of a single algorithm on a single dataset. The analysis\nreveals that algorithm performance under different downsampling portions\ndepends on factors like dataset characteristics, algorithm complexity, and the\nspecific downsampling configuration (scenario dependent). Some algorithms,\nwhich showed lower nDCG@10 scores compared to higher-performing ones, exhibited\nlower sensitivity to the amount of training data, offering greater potential\nfor efficiency in lower downsampling portions. On average, these algorithms\nretained 81% of full-size performance using only 50% of the training set. In\ncertain downsampling configurations, where more users were progressively\nincluded while keeping the test set size fixed, they even showed higher nDCG@10\nscores than when using the full dataset. These findings highlight the\nfeasibility of balancing sustainability and effectiveness, providing insights\nfor designing energy-efficient recommender systems and promoting sustainable AI\npractices.",

While previous works\nhave introduced SWAP-free benchmarks with known-optimal depths for evaluating\nQLS tools, these benchmarks overlook SWAP count - a key performance metric.\nReal-world applications often require SWAP gates, making SWAP-free benchmarks\ninsufficient for fully assessing QLS tool performance. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce QUBIKOS, a benchmark set with provable-optimal SWAP\ncounts and non-trivial circuit structures. For the first time, we are able to\nquantify the optimality gaps of SWAP gate usages of the leading QLS algorithms,\nwhich are surprisingly large: LightSabre from IBM delivers the best performance\nwith an optimality gap of 63x, followed by ML-QLS with an optimality gap of\n117x. Similarly, QMAP and t|ket> exhibit significantly larger gaps of 250x and\n330x, respectively. This highlights the need for further advancements in QLS\nmethodologies. Beyond evaluation, QUBIKOS offers valuable insights for guiding\nthe development of future QLS tools, as demonstrated through an analysis of a\nsuboptimal case in LightSABRE.

Additionally, a\nstatistically established threshold is employed to classify the result as\neither a reliable or non-reliable prognosis.

Our framework proposes Mixture of Temporal Experts\n(MoTE) to leverage both semantic and data distributional shifts to learn and\nadapt temporal trends into classification models. Our analysis shows\nclassification performance varies over time across different languages, and we\nexperimentally demonstrate that MoTE can enhance classifier generalizability\nover temporal data shifts. Our study provides analytic insights and addresses\nthe need for time-aware models that perform robustly in multilingual scenarios.",

It has shown promising results in a few healthy,\npredominantly young adults, providing anatomical images of the cortex\n(periosteal and endosteal surfaces) along with estimations of US wave speed.\nHowever, its reliability in older or osteoporotic bones remains uncertain. In\nthis study, we critically assessed the performance of intracortical US imaging\nex vivo in bones with various microstructural patterns, including bones\nexhibiting signs of unbalanced intracortical remodeling. We analyzed factors\ninfluencing US image quality, particularly endosteal surface reconstruction, as\nwell as the accuracy of wave speed estimation and its relationship with\nporosity. We imaged 20 regions of interest from the femoral diaphysis of five\nelderly donors using a 2.5 MHz US transducer. The reconstructed US images were\ncompared to site-matched high-resolution micro-CT (HR-muCT) images. In samples\nwith moderate porosity, the endosteal surface was accurately identified, and\nthickness estimates from US and HR-muCT differed by less than 10%. In highly\nremodeled bones with increased porosity, the reconstructed endosteal surface\nappeared less bright and was located above the cortex region containing\nresorption cavities. We observed a decrease in US wave speed with increasing\ncortical porosity suggesting that the method could discriminate between bones\nwith low porosity (less than 5%) and those with moderate to high porosity\n(greater than ~10%). This study paves the way for the application of US imaging\nin diagnosing cortical bone health, particularly for detecting increased\ncortical porosity and reduced cortical thickness.",

This challenge arises due to the ambiguous quantum\nnature of Hawking particles and constraints imposed by information\nconservation. This study develops a heuristic statistical model using a\nworldine Lagrangian formalism, treating Hawking particles as timelike with an\neffective mass and following an arbitrary statistical distribution. The flow of\ninformation is modeled as a transfer of microstates from the event horizon to\nthe radiation background within a closed ensemble.

Beyond\npreserving conventional insights, reinforcing the statistical nature of black\nhole evaporation, this approach introduces novel perspectives: modeling the\nblack hole as a structured energy well containing microstates, quantifying the\nevaporation rate of individual microstates, and determining the total number of\nmicrostates from the horizon's surface area.

    "abstract": "The rise of deep neural networks (DNNs) has driven an increased demand for\ncomputing power and memory. Modern DNNs exhibit high data volume variation\n(HDV) across tasks, which poses challenges for FPGA acceleration: conventional\naccelerators rely on fixed execution patterns (dataflow or sequential) that can\nlead to pipeline stalls or necessitate frequent off-chip memory accesses. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce the Inter-Task Auto-Reconfigurable\nAccelerator (InTAR), a novel accelerator design methodology for HDV\napplications on FPGAs. InTAR combines the high computational efficiency of\nsequential execution with the reduced off-chip memory overhead of dataflow\nexecution. It switches execution patterns automatically with a static schedule\ndetermined before circuit design based on resource constraints and problem\nsizes. Unlike previous reconfigurable accelerators, InTAR encodes\nreconfiguration schedules during circuit design, allowing model-specific\noptimizations that allocate only the necessary logic and interconnects. Thus,\nInTAR achieves a high clock frequency with fewer resources and low\nreconfiguration time. Furthermore, InTAR supports high-level tools such as HLS\nfor fast design generation. We implement a set of multi-task HDV DNN kernels\nusing InTAR. Compared with dataflow and sequential accelerators, InTAR exhibits\n$\\mathbf{1.8\\times}$ and $\\mathbf{7.1 \\times}$ speedups correspondingly.\nMoreover, we extend InTAR to GPT-2 medium as a more complex example, which is\n$\\mathbf{3.65 \\sim 39.14\\times}$ faster and a $\\mathbf{1.72 \\sim 10.44\\times}$\nmore DSP efficient than SoTA accelerators (Allo and DFX) on FPGAs.\nAdditionally, this design demonstrates $\\mathbf{1.66 \\sim 7.17\\times}$ better\npower efficiency than GPUs.

This approach can produce high spatial resolution EEG data\nfrom low resolution samples, by generating channel-wise upsampled data to\neffectively interpolate numerous missing channels, thus reducing the need for\nexpensive EEG equipment.

The mechanism responsible for\nthe extraction of oil from the mixtures is the acoustowetting phenomenon: the\nlow surface tension oil phase leaves the mixture in the form of `fingers' that\ninitially spread over the solid in the direction transverse to that of the SAW.\nOnce away from the drop the oil spreads on the solid surface in the direction\nopposite that of the SAW, as in classic studies on acoustowetting. The high\nsurface tension water phase remains at rest. Increasing the SAW intensity and\noil content in the mixtures enhances the rate at which oil leaves the emulsion.\nWe further observe that the oil film develops free surface instabilities in the\nform of periodic spatial variations, as well as the formation of spatial\ngradients in the emulsion concentrations in the presence of SAW. Our study\nsuggests the potential for using SAW to remove oil from oil-in-water mixtures\nto facilitate the small-scale separation of water and oil phases.

Additionally, data augmentation can destabilize training in\nlow-resolution models, but including zero as a potential value in the weight\nparameters helps maintain stability and prevents performance degradation.\nOverall, 2.32-bit weights offer the optimal balance of memory reduction,\nperformance, and efficiency. However, further research should explore other\ndataset types and more complex and larger models. These findings suggest a\npotential new era for optimized neural network models with reduced memory\nrequirements and improved computational efficiency, though advancements in\ndedicated hardware are necessary to fully realize this potential.",

A path to making progress in this direction is to study\nthe model's behavior in a setting with carefully controlled data. Then\ninterpret the learned representations and reverse-engineer the computation\nperformed internally. We study decoder-only transformer language models trained\nfrom scratch to predict shortest paths on simple, connected and undirected\ngraphs. In this setting, the representations and the dynamics learned by the\nmodel are interpretable. We present three major results: (1) Two-layer\ndecoder-only language models can learn to predict shortest paths on simple,\nconnected graphs containing up to 10 nodes. (2) Models learn a graph embedding\nthat is correlated with the spectral decomposition of the line graph.

For instance,\nmonolayers of 1T- and 1H-TaS2 are Mott insulating and metallic (also\nsuperconducting), respectively, and thus, the T/H bilayer systems have been\nextensively investigated in the context of heavy fermions and unconventional\nsuperconductivity, which are expected phases from localized spins (1T)\ncoexisting with itinerant electrons (1H). However, recent studies revealed that\nsignificant charge transfer from the 1T to 1H layers removes the 1T Mottness\nand renders the above scenario elusive. In this work, we propose a T/T/H\ntrilayer heterostructure by combining a T/T bilayer -- which is a band\ninsulator with flat dispersion -- with a 1H layer. After charge redistribution,\nthis trilayer heterostructure shows localized spins in the Mott flat band of\nthe T/T bilayer and weak spin polarization in the metallic H layer. We argue\nthat by varying the stacking configurations of the T/T bilayer in the T/T/H\ntrilayer, a crossover from a doped Mott insulator to a Kondo insulator can be\nachieved. The T/T/H trilayer provides therefore a rich novel heterostructure\nplatform to study strong correlation phenomena and unconventional\nsuperconductivity.",

The aggregator serves as a facilitator, enabling flexibility asset\nowners to get access to different markets. In which, EVs aggregators are\ngaining more attention due to their expanding use and potential to provide\nservices in various types of markets, particularly in the reserve market.\nCurrently, TSO indirectly utilizes these resources under the management of the\ndistribution system operators (DSO), which can negatively impact the\ndistribution grid. Conversely, adjustments from DSOs can impact service\nprovision to TSO due to the shortage of TSO usage information. These factors\nhighlight the importance of evaluating the service provision from aggregators\nunder different TSO-DSO coordination schemes. This paper focuses on the\nprovision of flexibility from electric vehicles (EVs) aggregators for balancing\nservice in the TSO-DSO hybrid-managed and compares it with the DSO-managed\ncoordination schemes.

    "abstract": "Stereotype biases in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) perpetuate harmful\nsocietal prejudices, undermining the fairness and equity of AI applications. As\nLMMs grow increasingly influential, addressing and mitigating inherent biases\nrelated to stereotypes, harmful generations, and ambiguous assumptions in\nreal-world scenarios has become essential. However, existing datasets\nevaluating stereotype biases in LMMs often lack diversity and rely on synthetic\nimages, leaving a gap in bias evaluation for real-world visual contexts. To\naddress this, we introduce the Stereotype Bias Benchmark (SB-bench), the most\ncomprehensive framework to date for assessing stereotype biases across nine\ndiverse categories with non-synthetic images. SB-bench rigorously evaluates\nLMMs through carefully curated, visually grounded scenarios, challenging them\nto reason accurately about visual stereotypes. It offers a robust evaluation\nframework featuring real-world visual samples, image variations, and\nmultiple-choice question formats. By introducing visually grounded queries that\nisolate visual biases from textual ones, SB-bench enables a precise and nuanced\nassessment of a model's reasoning capabilities across varying levels of\ndifficulty. Through rigorous testing of state-of-the-art open-source and\nclosed-source LMMs, SB-bench provides a systematic approach to assessing\nstereotype biases in LMMs across key social dimensions. This benchmark\nrepresents a significant step toward fostering fairness in AI systems and\nreducing harmful biases, laying the groundwork for more equitable and socially\nresponsible LMMs. Our code and dataset are publicly available.",

Natural variation in outcomes makes teasing apart responders from\nnon-responders a statistical inference problem. To handle latent responses, we\nintroduce the causal two-groups (C2G) model, a causal extension of the\nclassical two-groups model. The C2G model posits that treated samples may or\nmay not experience an effect, according to some prior probability. We propose\ntwo empirical Bayes procedures for the causal two-groups model, one under\nsemi-parametric conditions and another under fully nonparametric conditions.\nThe semi-parametric model assumes additive treatment effects and is\nidentifiable from observed data. The nonparametric model is unidentifiable, but\nwe show it can still be used to test for response in each treated sample.

By leveraging the inherent evidence-finding\ncapabilities of LMs using the attention scores of deeper layers, our method\nautomatically identifies and emphasizes key evidence within the input context,\nfacilitating more accurate and grounded responses without additional training\nor iterative prompting. We demonstrate that SelfElicit brings consistent and\nsignificant improvement on multiple evidence-based QA tasks for various LM\nfamilies while maintaining computational efficiency.

To effectively scale experimentation, firms rely on\ndecision rules: standard operating procedures for mapping the results of an\nexperiment to a choice of treatment arm to launch to the general user\npopulation. Despite the critical role of decision rules in translating\nexperimentation into business decisions, rigorous guidance on how to evaluate\nand choose decision rules is scarce.

This approach\ncombines astrophysical studies with biological experiments to better understand\nthe potential impacts of UVR on exoplanetary surfaces. UVR is particularly\nrelevant because it reaches the surface of planets and can influence their\nhabitability. The specific wavelengths within the UVR spectrum depend on the\nplanet's atmospheric composition and the spectral energy distribution of its\nhost star. Additionally, high UVR fluxes emitted during flares and superflares\nare of particular interest due to the limited information available regarding\ntheir biological impact. The EXO-UV program has successfully led to the first\nexperimental study examining the biological effects of high UVR fluences, such\nas those produced by flares and superflares. Future experimental studies aim to\ninvestigate the biological effects of repetitive flares. In this paper, we\nreview the latest results from our EXO-UV program.",

In particular, graph-based\nmethods allow for the inference of orthology estimates without prior knowledge\nof the underlying gene or species trees. This results in orthology graphs,\nwhere each vertex represents a gene, and an edge exists between two vertices if\nthe corresponding genes are estimated to be orthologs. Orthology graphs\ninferred under a tree-like evolutionary model must be cographs. However,\nreal-world data often deviate from this property, either due to noise in the\ndata, errors in inference methods or, simply, because evolution follows a\nnetwork-like rather than a tree-like process. The latter, in particular, raises\nthe question of whether and how orthology graphs can be derived from or,\nequivalently, are explained by phylogenetic networks. Here, we study the\nconstraints imposed on orthology graphs when the underlying evolutionary\nhistory follows a phylogenetic network instead of a tree. We show that any\northology graph can be represented by a sufficiently complex level-k network.\nHowever, such networks lack biologically meaningful constraints. In contrast,\nlevel-1 networks provide a simpler explanation, and we establish\ncharacterizations for level-1 explainable orthology graphs, i.e., those derived\nfrom level-1 evolutionary histories. To this end, we employ modular\ndecomposition, a classical technique for studying graph structures.\nSpecifically, an arbitrary graph is level-1 explainable if and only if each\nprimitive subgraph is a near-cograph (a graph in which the removal of a single\nvertex results in a cograph). Additionally, we present a linear-time algorithm\nto recognize level-1 explainable orthology graphs and to construct a level-1\nnetwork that explains them, if such a network exists.",

We formally model such a scheme by an\noptimization problem, whose solution jointly identifies the constellation\ndiagram and the repetition code. We call the proposed scheme ReMAC.

Their power depends\non the BH magnetic field strength and spin. To survive the infalling stellar\nmaterial, jets need the central BH to attain dynamically important magnetic\nfields that can suppress the mass inflow and lead to a magnetically arrested\ndisk (MAD). Previous work found that non-radiative MADs can spin down their BHs\nto an equilibrium spin, $a_{\\rm eq}^\\text{nr}=0.035-0.07$. Such low spins\nresult in extremely low power jets that may struggle to escape out of the star.\nHowever, the dense and hot collapsar disks emit neutrinos that cool the disk,\nreduce its thickness, and increase the angular momentum supply to the BH. Using\n3D two-moment neutrino-transport general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations, we show for the first time that successful collapsar jets powered\nby neutrino-cooled disks still rapidly spin down their BHs, although to a\nhigher $a_{\\rm eq}\\approx 0.13$. This value is consistent with LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA\ninferred spins, is $2-4$x higher than for non-radiative MADs, and results in\n$4-16$x more powerful LGRB jets, which are more capable of drilling out of the\nprogenitor star. This value of $a_{\\rm eq}$ holds across a wide range of\nprogenitor structures and mass accretion rates, $\\dot{m}\n\\sim(0.1-10)M_{\\odot}/\\rm{s}$. We find that for typical LGRB durations,\n$t\\gtrsim30$~s, such BHs consume sufficient mass to reach $a_{\\rm eq} \\approx\n0.13$ by LGRB's end.

Two prominent\nstrategies for enhancing public transit services and alleviating congestion,\nExclusive Bus Lane (EBL) and High Occupancy Vehicle Lane (HOVL), are gaining\nincreasing attention. EBLs prioritize bus transit by providing dedicated lanes\nfor faster travel times, while HOVLs encourage carpooling by reserving lanes\nfor high-occupancy vehicles. However, static implementations of these policies\nmay underutilize road resources and disrupt general-purpose lanes. Dynamic\ncontrol of these policies, based on real-time demand, can potentially maximize\nroad efficiency and minimize negative impacts. This study develops cost\nfunctions for Mixed Traffic Policy (MTP), Exclusive Bus Lane Policy (EBLP), and\nHigh Occupancy Vehicle Lane Policy (HOVLP), incorporating optimized bus\nfrequency and demand split under equilibrium condition. Switching thresholds\nfor policy selection are derived to identify optimal periods for implementing\neach policy based on dynamic demand simulated using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U)\nprocess. Results reveal significant reductions in total system costs with the\nproposed dynamic policy integration. Compared to static implementations, the\ncombined policy achieves cost reductions of 12.0%, 5.3% and 42.5% relative to\nMTP-only, EBLP-only, and HOVLP-only scenarios, respectively. Additionally, in\ntwo real case studies of existing EBL and HOVL operations, the proposed dynamic\npolicy reduces total costs by 32.2% and 27.9%, respectively. The findings\nprovide valuable insights for policymakers and transit planners, offering a\nrobust framework for dynamically scheduling and integrating EBL and HOVL\npolicies to optimize urban corridor efficiency and reduce overall system costs.",

Our methods are built on top of earlier work by Valloni, who\nrelated the group $\\operatorname{Br}(X)/\\operatorname{Br}_1(X)$ to the\narithmetic structure of the CM field $E$. It is from this arithmetic structure\nthat we deduce our bounds.",

    "abstract": "Galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound structures in the\nUniverse, contain vast amounts of dark matter, galaxies, and hot ionised gas\nknown as the intracluster medium (ICM). In relaxed cluster cores, the ICM\nappears to cool radiatively faster than the age of the cluster, but the Galaxy\nclusters contain vast amounts of hot ionised gas known as the intracluster\nmedium (ICM). In relaxed cluster cores, the radiative cooling time of the ICM\nis shorter than the age of the cluster, but the absence of line emission\nassociated with cooling suggests heating mechanisms that offset the cooling,\nwith feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) being the most likely source.\nTurbulence and bulk motions, such as the oscillating (\"sloshing\") motion of the\ncore gas in the cluster potential well, have also been proposed as mechanisms\nfor heat distribution from the outside of the core. Here we present X-ray\nspectroscopic observations of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the XRISM\nsatellite. We find that the hot gas flows along the line of sight relative to\nthe central galaxy, with velocities from 130 km/s to 310 km/s within ~30 kpc of\nthe centre. This indicates bulk flow consistent with core gas sloshing. While\nthe bulk flow may prevent excessive accumulation of cooled gas at the centre,\nit could distribute the heat injected by the AGN and bring in thermal energy\nfrom the surrounding ICM. The velocity dispersion of the gas is found to be\nonly ~<120 km/s in the core, even within ~10 kpc of the AGN. This suggests that\nthe AGN's influence on the surrounding ICM motion is limited in the cluster.",

When $K=N/2$, we show that the quantum algorithm succeeds with\nprobability $1$, whereas classically $\\Theta(N)$ samples are required to\nsucceed with bounded probability of error.

Subhorizon dark matter density\nperturbations grow faster during an EMDE than during a radiation-dominated era,\nleading to the formation of \"microhalos\" far earlier than in standard models of\nstructure formation. This enhancement of small-scale structure boosts the\ndark-matter annihilation rate, which contributes to the heating of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM). We compute how the dark matter annihilation rate\nevolves after an EMDE and forecast how well measurements of the 21-cm\nbackground can detect dark matter annihilation in cosmologies with EMDEs. We\nfind that future measurements of the global 21-cm signal at a redshift of\n$z\\sim 17$ are unlikely to improve on bounds derived from observations of the\nisotropic gamma-ray background, but measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum\nhave the potential to detect dark matter annihilation following an EMDE.\nMoreover, dark matter annihilation and astrophysical X-rays produce distinct\nheating signatures in the 21-cm power spectrum at redshifts around 14,\npotentially allowing differentiation between these two IGM heating mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that the co-genesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be\nachieved through the rotation of an axion-like particle, driven by a flip in\nthe vacuum manifold's direction at the end of inflation. This can occur if the\naxion has a periodic non-minimal coupling to gravity, while preserving the\ndiscrete shift symmetry. In non-oscillating inflation models, after inflation\nthere is typically a period of kination (with $w = 1$). In this case, it is\nshown that the vacuum manifold of the axion is flipped and the axion begins\nrotating in field space, because it can slide across the decreasing potential\nbarrier as in Ricci reheating. Such a rotating axion can generate the baryon\nasymmetry of the Universe through spontaneous baryogenesis, while at later\nepochs it can oscillate as dark matter. The period of kination makes the\nprimordial gravitational waves (GW) generated during inflation sharply\nblue-tilted which constrains the parameter space due to GW overproduction,\nwhile being testable by next generation CMB experiments. As a concrete example,\nwe show that such a cogenesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be\nrealized for the axion as the Majoron in the Type-I seesaw setup, predicting\nmass ranges for the Majoron below sub eVs, with right-handed neutrino mass\nabove $\\mathcal{O}(10^{8})$ GeV. We also show that in order to avoid\nfragmentation of the axion condensate during the rotation, we require the\nnon-minimal coupling $\\xi \\sim (f/m_P)^2 $ or somewhat larger, where $f$ is the\naxion decay constant.",

Despite the marked differences in variability patterns between these\nstates, the spectral energy distributions remain strikingly similar, with only\nminor changes in the black body component in the soft X-ray range. We find that\nthe QPO frequency correlates with the X-ray count rates and hardness,\nsuggesting a tight coupling between the QPO mechanism and the accretion disc's\nspectral properties. Additionally, we demonstrate that flip-flops can occur on\nvery short timescales, with almost 50 state changes within ~1200 s, while both\nstates can also remain stable over longer periods (at least 1000 s). We explore\nvarious QPO models to explain these observations, including the possibility\nthat the corona's accretion speed is near the sound speed, affecting the\npresence of QPOs. However, the exact mechanism driving the flip-flops and the\nQPOs remains unclear.

    "abstract": "It has long been known that, in the absence of a dark matter (DM) halo,\ngalaxy discs tend to develop global gravitational instabilities that strongly\nmodify their initial structure. The recent discovery of gas-rich ultra diffuse\ngalaxies (UDGs) that seem to live in DM halos with very low concentrations, a\nvery atypical configuration in the standard cosmological framework, poses\ntherefore a crucial question: is the small contribution from such DM halos\nsufficient to stabilize the UDG discs? In this work we investigate this\nquestion, focusing on the extreme UDG AGC 114905, which previous works found to\nbe unstable. Here, we revisit these studies, using idealised numerical\nsimulations with AREPO of a system composed by a stellar disc, a gas disc and a\nDM halo in initial equilibrium with each other and with properties based on\nslightly revised observational data of AGC 114905. We explore different\nscenarios for the DM halo and we run our simulations for 5 Gyr. We find that in\nall cases the stellar and the gas discs are stable and that their initial\ndensity distributions and kinematic properties remain unchanged during the\ncourse of the simulation. We discuss how the apparent discrepancy with previous\nworks (where the UDG developed instabilities) is due to our discs being\ndynamically hotter and living in slightly more massive DM halos, in accordance\nwith the new observational constraints, previously unavailable. Our findings\ndemonstrate that AGC 114905 (and likely other similar UDGs) can evolve\nunperturbed in halos that challenge current cosmological models.",

In this work we use\nintegral field spectroscopy data from the SAMI and MaNGA surveys to investigate\nthe AGN luminosity as a function of kinematic misalignment angle. Our sample of\nAGN exhibit bolometric luminosities in the range 10^40 to 10^43 erg/s,\nindicative of low to moderate luminosity AGN. We find no correlation between\nAGN luminosity as a function of misalignment for AGN host galaxies from both\nsurveys. We find some differences between the AGN luminosity of early- and\nlate-type AGN host galaxies (ETGs, LTGs). AGN in LTG hosts have a wider\nluminosity range, with most LTG hosts showing aligned stellar to gas\nkinematics. AGN in ETG hosts have a luminosity range that does not depend on\nmisalignment angle, suggesting AGN in ETG hosts are consistent with being\nfuelled by external accretion events, irrespective of their stellar to gas\nkinematic misalignment. While all the AGN in ETGs in our sample are consistent\nwith being activated and fuelled by external gas, the range of observed AGN\nluminosities is likely caused by secondary factors such as the amount of fresh\ngas brought into the galaxy by the external interaction.",

We find a significant low-frequency flattening at\nthe centres of five out of six HII regions that we selected for this study. The\nlow frequency flattening in HII regions of M 101 can be explained with two\ndifferent free-free absorption models. The flattening is localised in a region\nsmaller than 1.5 kpc and can only be detected with high resolution (better than\n45'').

Its influence is found to be sufficiently strong that such a\ndynamical component should be accounted for in Galactic-centre modelling. For\nthe Milky Way, the atom is expected to have some spherical asymmetry, and we\nuse this to derive a stability condition for the disc of young, massive stars\nat the Galactic centre - if the atom's mass is too large, then the disc would\nbe destroyed. Thus, the existence of this disc constrains the mass of the axion\nparticles comprising the solitonic core. We study an example model of the core,\nwhere all of the rotation of the core's inner region is assumed to come from an\n$l=1$ state, and its amplitude is determined by the halo's spin parameter; such\na core is found to be in tension with the stability of the clockwise stellar\ndisc for $4.4\\times 10^{-20}\\,\\textrm{eV} \\leq m_a \\leq 5.3\\times\n10^{-20}\\,\\textrm{eV}$ at $2\\sigma$. Other core models would vary the\nconstrained values of $m_a$ somewhat. These constraints will tighten\nsignificantly with future, improved data.",

Motivated by these developments, we study\nnonequilibrium phase transitions to absorbing states in one-dimensional systems\nthat can model certain quantum circuits. Specifically, we consider dynamics for\nwhich the absorbing states are not unique due to a discrete symmetry: Z2 for\ntwo-state models and S3 or Z3 for three-state models. Under time evolution,\ndomain walls in these models perform random walks and coarsen under local\nfeedback, which, if perfect, reduces their number over time, driving the system\nto an absorbing state in polynomial time. Imperfect feedback, however,\nintroduces domain wall multiplication (branching), potentially leading to an\nactive phase. For Z2-symmetric two-state models, starting from a single domain\nwall, we find distinct absorbing and active phases as in previous studies.\nExtending this analysis to local three-state models shows that any nonzero\nbranching rate drives the system into the active phase. However, we demonstrate\nthat incorporating nonlocal classical information into the feedback can\nstabilize the absorbing phase against branching. By tuning the level of\nnonlocality, we observe a transition from the active to the absorbing phase,\nwhich belongs to a new universality class.",

Inspired by the mechanical oscillatory rhythms of neural cells, we\ndeveloped a learning paradigm utilizing link strength oscillations, where\nlearning is associated with the coordination of these oscillations. Link\noscillations can rapidly change coordination, allowing the network to sense and\nadapt to subtle contextual changes without supervision. The network becomes a\ngeneralist AI architecture, capable of predicting dynamics of multiple contexts\nincluding unseen ones.

PASS consists of\nmultiple waveguides spanning over thousands of wavelength, which equip numerous\nlow-cost dielectric particles, named pinching antennas (PAs), to radiate\nsignals into free space. The positions of PAs can be reconfigured to change\nboth the large-scale path losses and phases of signals, thus facilitating the\nnovel pinching beamforming design. A sum rate maximization problem is\nformulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit and pinching beamforming to\nadaptively achieve constructive signal enhancement and destructive interference\nmitigation. To solve this highly coupled and nonconvex problem, both\noptimization-based and learning-based methods are proposed. 1) For the\noptimization-based method, a majorization-minimization and penalty dual\ndecomposition (MM-PDD) algorithm is developed, which handles the nonconvex\ncomplex exponential component using a Lipschitz surrogate function and then\ninvokes PDD for problem decoupling. 2) For the learning-based method, a novel\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-guided dual learning (KDL) approach is proposed, which\nenables KKT solutions to be reconstructed in a data-driven manner by learning\ndual variables. Following this idea, a KDL-Tranformer algorithm is developed,\nwhich captures both inter-PA/inter-user dependencies and\nchannel-state-information (CSI)-beamforming dependencies by attention\nmechanisms. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed PASS framework\nsignificantly outperforms conventional massive multiple input multiple output\n(MIMO) system even with a few PAs. ii) The proposed KDL-Transformer can improve\nover 30% system performance than MM-PDD algorithm, while achieving a\nmillisecond-level response on modern GPUs.",

To gain further insight into the relation between human neuronal\nactivity patterns and ontological classes, we introduced General Linear Model\n(GLM) analyses on fMRI data of participants who were presented with complex\nnaturalistic video stimuli comparable to the robot tasks. We modeled four event\nclasses (pick, place, fetch and deliver) attached to different environmental\nand object-related context and employed a Representational Similarity Analysis\n(RSA) on associated brain activity patterns as a starting point for an\nautomatic hierarchical clustering. Based on the default values for the\nHemodynamic Response Function (HRF), the activity patterns were reliably\ngrouped according to their parent classes of object interaction and navigation.\nAlthough fetch and deliver events were also distinguished by neuronal patterns,\npick and place events demonstrated higher ambiguity with respect to neuronal\nactivation patterns. Introducing a shorter HRF time-to-peak leads to a more\nreliable grouping of all four semantic classes, despite contextual factors.\nThese data might give novel insights into the neuronal representation of\ncomplex stimuli and may enable further research in ontology validation in\ncognition-enabled robotics.",

However, despite\nthe marked increase in the quantity of demonstrations collected, little work\nhas sought to assess the quality of said data despite mounting evidence of its\nimportance in other areas such as vision and language. In this work, we take a\ncritical step towards addressing the data quality in robotics. Given a dataset\nof demonstrations, we aim to estimate the relative quality of individual\ndemonstrations in terms of both action diversity and predictability. To do so,\nwe estimate the average contribution of a trajectory towards the mutual\ninformation between states and actions in the entire dataset, which captures\nboth the entropy of the marginal action distribution and the state-conditioned\naction entropy. Though commonly used mutual information estimators require vast\namounts of data often beyond the scale available in robotics, we introduce a\nnovel technique based on k-nearest neighbor estimates of mutual information on\ntop of simple VAE embeddings of states and actions. Empirically, we demonstrate\nthat our approach is able to partition demonstration datasets by quality\naccording to human expert scores across a diverse set of benchmarks spanning\nsimulation and real world environments.

Four approaches were used: a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN), random forest, XGBoost, and long short term memory (LSTM)\nrecurrent neural network, and compared to a baseline persistence model. We\nevaluated the models' performance in predicting severe drought (USDM drought\ncategory D2 or higher) using a macro F1 binary classification metric.

Combining this with hierarchical clustering, we resolve\nthe spatial distribution of probed domains by their distinct spectral\nsignatures, providing a robust method for analyzing magnetic configurations\nwith weak signals. Our results show that phase contrast is significantly\nstronger than the corresponding absorption contrast, offering higher\nspatial-resolution magnetic imaging. This approach establishes a reliable,\nelement- and orbital-sensitive tool for studying compensated magnets.",

In\nthis work, we propose and investigate a novel approach to surface passivation\nto mitigate these challenges in photonic nanostructures with III-As(P) quantum\nwells defined by a dry etching process. The nanostructures are annealed under\nthe phosphine (PH$_3$) ambient inside a metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy\nchamber to eliminate surface and subsurface defects induced during the dry\netching and subsequent oxidation of the etched sidewalls. Moreover,\nencapsulation of the active material with a wider bandgap material allows for\nmaintaining the band structure of the device, mitigating band bending effects.\nOur findings reveal an almost order of magnitude reduction in the surface\nrecombination velocity from $2 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{cm/s}$ for the PH$_3$\nannealing compared to $1.5 \\times 10^4 \\, \\mathrm{cm/s}$ for the non-passivated\nstructures and $5 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{cm/s}$ for the standard method based\non (NH$_4$)$_2$S wet treatment followed by Al$_2$O$_3$ encapsulation.

To address these\nissues, I develop an identification strategy to partially identify causal\neffects on the subset of units with well-defined and observed outcomes under\nboth treatment regimes. I adapt Lee bounds to the Changes-in-Changes (CiC)\nsetting (Athey & Imbens, 2006), leveraging the time dimension of the data to\nrelax the unconfoundedness assumption in the original trimming strategy of Lee\n(2009). This setting has the DiD identification strategy as a particular case,\nwhich I also implement in the paper. Additionally, I explore how to leverage\nmultiple sources of sample selection to relax the monotonicity assumption in\nLee (2009), which may be of independent interest.

When the market of\nunderlying securities is incomplete, non-linearity emerges from the bid-offer\naround the mid price that accounts for the residual risks of the optimal\nfunding and hedging strategy. At the extremes, non-linearity also arises from\nthe embedded options on capital that are exercised upon default. In this essay,\nthese convexities are quantified in an entropic risk metric that evaluates the\nstrategic risks, which is realised as a cost with the introduction of bilateral\nmargin. Price is then adjusted for market incompleteness and the risk of\ndefault caused by the exhaustion of capital.\n  In the complete market theory, price is derived from a martingale condition.\nIn the incomplete market theory presented here, price is instead derived from a\nlog-martingale condition: \\begin{equation}\np=-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\log\\mathbb{E}\\exp[-\\alpha P] \\notag \\end{equation} for the\nprice $p$ and payoff $P$ of a funded and hedged derivative security, where the\nprice measure $\\mathbb{E}$ has minimum entropy relative to economic\nexpectations, and the parameter $\\alpha$ matches the risk aversion of the\ninvestor.

    "abstract": "The block-model family has four popular network models (SBM, DCBM, MMSBM, and\nDCMM). A fundamental problem is, how well each of these models fits with real\nnetworks. We propose GoF-MSCORE as a new Goodness-of-Fit (GoF) metric for DCMM\n(the broadest one among the four), with two main ideas. The first is to use\ncycle count statistics as a general recipe for GoF. The second is a novel\nnetwork fitting scheme. GoF-MSCORE is a flexible GoF approach, and we further\nextend it to SBM, DCBM, and MMSBM. This gives rise to a series of GoF metrics\ncovering each of the four models in the block-model family.\n  We show that for each of the four models, if the assumed model is correct,\nthen the corresponding GoF metric converges to $N(0, 1)$ as the network sizes\ndiverge. We also analyze the powers and show that these metrics are optimal in\nmany settings. In comparison, many other GoF ideas face challenges: they may\nlack a parameter-free limiting null, or are non-optimal in power, or face an\nanalytical hurdle. Note that a parameter-free limiting null is especially\ndesirable as many network models have a large number of unknown parameters. The\nlimiting nulls of our GoF metrics are always $N(0,1)$, which are parameter-free\nas desired.\n  For 12 frequently-used real networks, we use the proposed GoF metrics to show\nthat DCMM fits well with almost all of them. We also show that SBM, DCBM, and\nMMSBM do not fit well with many of these networks, especially when the networks\nare relatively large. To complement with our study on GoF, we also show that\nthe DCMM is nearly as broad as the rank-$K$ network model. Based on these\nresults, we recommend the DCMM as a promising model for undirected networks.",

    "abstract": "In optoelectronic applications, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are\ncompelling materials because of their highly tuneable and intensely competitive\noptical properties. Colloidal synthesis enables the controlled formation of\nvarious morphologies of MHP nanocrystals, all with different carrier properties\nand, hence, different optical and carrier transport behaviours. We\ncharacterized three different methylammonium lead tribromide perovskite\n(MAPbBr3) morphologies: nanoplatelets (NPLs), nanosheets (NSs), and nanostripes\n(NSTs) synthesized by hot-injection synthesis protocols with slightly different\nparameters. A fluorescence imaging microscope (FLIM) for time- and\nspace-resolved measurements of the carrier migration was employed to quantify\nthe charge carriers' migration process upon photoexcitation. The results are\nrationalized in the two-dimensional diffusion model framework, considering\nfunnelling and trapping processes in mixed-n colloidal MHPs. Subdiffusion mode\nwas found to prevail in the nanocrystals, whereby the highest carrier\ndiffusivity was found for bulk-like NSTs, followed by layered NSs and a film of\nNPLs. These findings provide a better understanding of optoelectronic processes\nin perovskites relevant to photovoltaic and light-emitting devices.",

    "abstract": "Compared to local models built in a series-by-series manner, global models\nleverage relevant information across time series, resulting in improved\nforecasting performance and generalization capacity. Constructing global models\non a set of time series is becoming mainstream in the field of time series\nforecasting. However, the advantages of global models may not always be\nrealized when dealing with heterogeneous data. While they can adapt to\nheterogeneous datasets by increasing the model complexity, the model cannot be\ninfinitely complex due to the finite sample size, which poses challenges for\nthe application of global models. Additionally, determining whether the time\nseries data is homogeneous or heterogeneous can be ambiguous in practice. To\naddress these research gaps, this paper argues that the heterogeneity of the\ndata should be defined by the global model used, and for each series, the\nportion not modelled by the global model represents heterogeneity. It further\nproposes two-stage hybrid models, which include a second stage to identify and\nmodel heterogeneous patterns. In this second stage, we can estimate either all\nlocal models or sub-global models across different domains divided based on\nheterogeneity. Experiments on four open datasets reveal that the proposed\nmethods significantly outperform five existing models, indicating they\ncontribute to fully unleash the potential of global models on heterogeneous\ndatasets.",

To\naddress this, we introduce SPeCtrum, a grounded framework for constructing\nauthentic LLM agent personas by incorporating an individual's multidimensional\nself-concept. SPeCtrum integrates three core components: Social Identity (S),\nPersonal Identity (P), and Personal Life Context (C), each contributing\ndistinct yet interconnected aspects of identity. To evaluate SPeCtrum's\neffectiveness in identity representation, we conducted automated and human\nevaluations. Automated evaluations using popular drama characters showed that\nPersonal Life Context (C)-derived from short essays on preferences and daily\nroutines-modeled characters' identities more effectively than Social Identity\n(S) and Personal Identity (P) alone and performed comparably to the full SPC\ncombination. In contrast, human evaluations involving real-world individuals\nfound that the full SPC combination provided a more comprehensive self-concept\nrepresentation than C alone. Our findings suggest that while C alone may\nsuffice for basic identity simulation, integrating S, P, and C enhances the\nauthenticity and accuracy of real-world identity representation. Overall,\nSPeCtrum offers a structured approach for simulating individuals in LLM agents,\nenabling more personalized human-AI interactions and improving the realism of\nsimulation-based behavioral studies.",

On the other hand, we show\nthat Bayesian learning is fragile, while no-regret learning requires less\nknowledge of the environment and is therefore more robust.

In the second part of the study, we analyze the impact of\nphysiological factors (age, gender), cognitive factors (pronunciation ability),\nand external factors (vocabulary difficulty, background noise, and word count)\non SFM accuracy in children's speech using causal inference. The results\nindicate that physiology (age) and particular external factor (number of words\nin audio) have the highest impact on accuracy, followed by background noise and\npronunciation ability. Fine-tuning SFMs on children's speech reduces\nsensitivity to physiological and cognitive factors, while sensitivity to the\nnumber of words in audio persists.\n  Keywords: Children's ASR, Speech Foundational Models, Causal Inference,\nPhysiology, Cognition, Pronunciation",

Such additional components\nintroduce vulnerabilities that make these LLM-powered agents much easier to\nattack than isolated LLMs, yet relatively little work focuses on the security\nof LLM agents. In this paper, we analyze security and privacy vulnerabilities\nthat are unique to LLM agents. We first provide a taxonomy of attacks\ncategorized by threat actors, objectives, entry points, attacker observability,\nattack strategies, and inherent vulnerabilities of agent pipelines. We then\nconduct a series of illustrative attacks on popular open-source and commercial\nagents, demonstrating the immediate practical implications of their\nvulnerabilities.

Therefore, conventional\nclassifiers should not be applied in high-risk fields where classification\nresults can have significant consequences. In order to address this issue, it\nis necessary to quantify uncertainty and adopt decision-making approaches that\ntake it into account. Many methods have been proposed for this purpose;\nhowever, implementing these methods often requires performing resampling,\nimproving the structure or performance of models, and optimizing the thresholds\nof classifiers. We propose a new decision-making approach using two types of\nhypothesis testing. This method is capable of detecting ambiguous data that\nbelong to the overlapping regions of two class distributions, as well as\nout-of-distribution data that are not included in the training data\ndistribution. In addition, we quantify uncertainty using the empirical\ndistribution of feature values derived from the training data obtained through\nthe trained model.

The heterogeneity in data distribution frequently arises\nfrom spatial distribution of devices, leading to degraded model performance in\nthe absence of proper handling. Additionally, FL typical reliance on\ncentralized architectures introduces bottlenecks and single-point-of-failure\nrisks, particularly problematic at scale or in dynamic environments.

Moreover,\nFBFL not only overcomes the aforementioned limitations, but also enables the\ndevelopment of more specialized models tailored to the specific data\ndistribution in each subregion. This paper formalizes FBFL and evaluates it\nextensively using MNIST, FashionMNIST, and Extended MNIST datasets.

For the Finite\nElement approximation of the director field, we compare the usage of a discrete\ninner product, usually referred to as mass-lumping, for a globally continuous,\npiecewise linear discretization to a piecewise constant, discontinuous Galerkin\napproach.

    "abstract": "In recent decades, Earth-to-Air Heat Exchangers (EAHEs), also known as\nunderground air ducts, have garnered significant attention for their ability to\nprovide energy-efficient cooling and heating solutions while maintaining a\nminimal environmental footprint. These systems leverage the relatively stable\nunderground temperature to regulate indoor climates, reducing reliance on\nconventional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. This\nreview systematically categorizes and synthesizes research on EAHEs into three\nprimary areas: analytical, numerical, and exergoeconomic studies. Analytical\napproaches focus on developing theoretical models to predict thermal\nperformance, while numerical simulations provide insights into system\noptimization and real-world applications. Exergoeconomic analyses, integrating\nthermodynamic efficiency with economic considerations, offer valuable\nperspectives on cost-effectiveness and long-term viability. By consolidating\nexisting contributions across these domains, this study serves as a\ncomprehensive reference for researchers, engineers, and policymakers seeking to\nenhance the design, implementation, and performance of EAHE systems. The\nfindings emphasize the pivotal role of EAHEs in reducing energy consumption,\nlowering greenhouse gas emissions, and improving economic sustainability.\nAdditionally, this review identifies key challenges, including soil thermal\nconductivity variations, moisture effects, and system integration with\nrenewable energy sources, which require further investigation. By addressing\nthese challenges, EAHEs can be further optimized to serve as a cornerstone in\nsustainable energy management, contributing to global efforts toward\nenergy-efficient building solutions and climate change mitigation.",

We show that a single\nadversarial node coupled via adversarial couplings to one or more other nodes\nis sufficient to destabilize the entire network, which we prove to be more\nefficient than targeting multiple nodes. Then, we show that concentrating the\nattack on a single low-indegree node induces the greatest instability,\nchallenging the common assumption that hubs are the most critical nodes. This\nleads to a new characterization of the vulnerability of a node, which contrasts\nwith previous work, and identifies low-indegree nodes (as opposed to the hubs)\nas the most vulnerable components of a network. Our results are derived for\nlinear systems but hold true for nonlinear networks, including those described\nby the Kuramoto model. Finally, we derive scaling laws showing that larger\nnetworks are less susceptible, on average, to single-node attacks.

However, in this work we present a\ncounterintuitive finding: we observe that LLMs perform better in math reasoning\ntasks when these rationales are eliminated from the context and models are left\nto infer on their own what makes an incorrect answer flawed. This approach also\nsubstantially outperforms chain-of-thought prompting in our evaluations. These\nresults are consistent across LLMs of different sizes and varying reasoning\nabilities. To gain an understanding of why LLMs learn from mistakes more\neffectively without explicit corrective rationales, we perform a thorough\nanalysis, investigating changes in context length and answer diversity between\ndifferent prompting strategies, and their effect on performance.

In particular, self-propelled\nparticle systems provide challenging research subjects in experimental and\ntheoretical physics, since individual and collective behaviors of units\nperforming persistent motions can not be described by usual fluctuation theory\nfor equilibrium systems. A typical example of man-made self-propelled systems\nwhich can be easily handled in small-sized experiments is a system of camphor\nfloats put on the surface of water. Based on the experimental and theoretical\nstudied by Nishimori et al. (J. Phys. Soc.

In the previous mathematical models introduced by Nishimori\net al. are coupled systems of the equations of motion for camphor disks\ndescribed by ordinary differential equations and the partial differential\nequation for the concentration field of camphor molecules in water. Here we\nconsider coupled systems of equation of motions of camphor disks and random\nwalks representing individual camphor molecules in water. In other words, we\ntake into account non-equilibrium fluctuations by introducing stochastic\nprocesses into the deterministic models. Numerical simulation shows that our\nmodels can represent self-propelled motions of individual camphor disk as well\nas repulsive interactions among them. We focus on the one-dimensional models in\nwhich viscosity is dominant, and derive a dynamical system of a camphor disk by\ntaking the average of random variables of our stochastic system.

    "abstract": "We explore a model of interacting Early Dark Energy (EDE) in which a\nminimally coupled scalar field, representing the EDE, interacts with the\nradiation sector through an exponential coupling function in the\nradiation-dominated era. This framework can be inspired by modified theories of\ngravity, including $f(R)$ gravity, the Einstein frame representation of\nBrans-Dicke theory, and chameleon gravity. Our findings reveal that the\ntraditional law of radiation conservation is altered to $\\rho_{\\gamma}\\propto\na^{-4+\\epsilon}$, where the parameter $\\epsilon$ measures the rate of energy\ntransfer between radiation and EDE. Assuming a constant energy transfer, we\nshow that the scalar field behaves as $\\phi\\propto\\ln a$, indicating that\n$\\phi$ diverges as $a$ approaches zero. Additionally, we demonstrate that the\ninteracting scalar-photon system behaves similar to an effective cosmological\nconstant in the early stages of evolution of the Universe. Moreover, by solving\nthe conservation equation associated with the scalar field, we derive an\nanalytical expression for the ratio $r=\\rho_{\\phi}/\\rho_{\\gamma}$. Our results\nindicate that $r$ diminishes as the Universe expands, which is essential for a\nsuccessful EDE model. Our investigation into the parameter space confirms that\nthe expected behavior of $r$ during recombination aligns with contemporary\ncosmological data. These insights underscore crucial aspects necessary for any\nfeasible EDE model and present exciting possibilities for resolving the Hubble\ntension.",

This paper points out an important\nsubtlety when applying the e-BH procedure with e-processes, which are\nsequential generalizations of e-values (where the data are observed\nsequentially). Since adaptively stopped e-processes are e-values, the e-BH\nprocedure can be repeatedly applied at every time step, and one can\ncontinuously monitor the e-processes and the rejection sets obtained. One would\nhope that the \"stopped e-BH procedure\" (se-BH) has an FDR guarantee for the\nrejection set obtained at any stopping time. However, while this is true if the\ndata in different streams are independent, it is not true in full generality,\nbecause each stopped e-process is an e-value only for stopping times in its own\nlocal filtration, but the se-BH procedure employs a stopping time with respect\nto a global filtration. This can cause information to leak across time,\nallowing one stream to know its future by knowing past data of another stream.\nThis paper formulates a simple causal condition under which local e-processes\nare also global e-processes and thus the se-BH procedure does indeed control\nthe FDR. The condition excludes unobserved confounding from the past and is met\nunder most reasonable scenarios including genomics.",

The ability to calculate the deformation potential from\nfirst principles allows for the scattering rates to be determined without the\nuse of lengthy empirical methods. For Si, the numerically calculated\ndeformation potentials are in excellent agreement with what is seen in the\nliterature. On the other hand, the deformation potentials calculated for\ndiamond were found to be larger than what has been seen previously, however\nprevious calculations of transport parameters in diamond report a large range\nof values for scattering parameters which may be due to assumptions made in\neach model. Excellent agreement was also seen between the value calculated for\ncBN and the literature, however there are no experimental results for cBN and\nso this value is compared against an estimate.

    "abstract": "The properties of black holes and accretion flows can be inferred by fitting\nEvent Horizon Telescope (EHT) data to simulated images generated through\ngeneral relativistic ray tracing (GRRT). However, due to the computationally\nintensive nature of GRRT, the efficiency of generating specific radiation flux\nimages needs to be improved. This paper introduces the Branch Correction\nDenoising Diffusion Model (BCDDM), a deep learning framework that synthesizes\nblack hole images directly from physical parameters. The model incorporates a\nbranch correction mechanism and a weighted mixed loss function to enhance\naccuracy and stability. We have constructed a dataset of 2,157 GRRT-simulated\nimages for training the BCDDM, which spans seven key physical parameters of the\nradiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model. Our experiments show a\nstrong correlation between the generated images and their physical parameters.\nBy enhancing the GRRT dataset with BCDDM-generated images and using ResNet50\nfor parameter regression, we achieve significant improvements in parameter\nprediction performance. BCDDM offers a novel approach to reducing the\ncomputational costs of black hole image generation, providing a faster and more\nefficient pathway for dataset augmentation, parameter estimation, and model\nfitting.",

Measuring the current-phase relation (CPR) in\nJJ based on topological insulators (TI) can provide critical insights into\nunconventional phenomena in these systems, such as the presence of Majorana\nbound states (MBS) and the nature of non-reciprocal transport.

When a single flux quantum\n$\\Phi_\\mathrm{0}$ threads the junction, we observe anomalous peak-dip-shaped\nCPR behaviour and non-reciprocal supercurrent flow. We demonstrate that these\nanomalies stem from the edge-amplified sloped supercurrent profile rather than\nMBS signatures often invoked to explain puzzles emerging near $\\Phi_\\mathrm{0}$\nin TI-based JJ. Furthermore, we show that such a supercurrent profile gives\nrise to a previously overlooked, robust and tunable Josephson diode effect.\nThese findings establish field-dependent CPR measurements as a critical tool\nfor exploring topological superconducting devices and offer new design\nprinciples for non-reciprocal superconducting electronics.",

Photoexcitations in these systems are believed to\nbe exciton polarons, Coulombically bound electron-hole pairs dressed by lattice\nvibrations. Understanding and controlling the structural and chemical factors\nthat govern this interaction is crucial for optimizing exciton recombination,\ntransport, and many-body interactions. Our study examines the role of the\norganic cation in a prototypical 2D-MHP system, phenylethylammonium lead\niodide, (PEA)2PbI4, and its halogenated derivatives, (F/Cl-PEA)2PbI4. These\nsubstitutions allow us to probe polaronic effects while maintaining the average\nlattice and electronic structure. Using resonant impulsive stimulated Raman\nscattering (RISRS), we analyze the metal-halide sub-lattice motion coupled to\nexcitons. We apply formalism based on a perturbative expansion of the nonlinear\nresponse function on the experimental data to estimate the Huang-Rhys\nparameter, $S=1/2 \\Delta^2$, to quantify the lattice displacement ($\\Delta$)\ndue to exciton-phonon coupling. A direct correlation emerges between lattice\ndisplacement and octahedral distortion, with F-PEA exhibiting the largest shift\nand Cl-PEA exhibiting the least, significantly influencing the fine structure\nfeatures in absorption. Additionally, 2D electronic spectroscopy reveals that\nF-PEA, with the strongest polaronic coupling, exhibits the least thermal\ndephasing, supporting the polaronic protection hypothesis. Our findings suggest\nthat systematic organic cation substitution serves as a tunable control for the\nfine structure in 2D-MHPs, and offers a pathway to mitigate many-body\nscattering effects by tailoring the polaronic coupling.",

    "abstract": "This study examines how temperature settings and model architectures affect\nthe generation of structured fictional data (names, birthdates) across three\nlarge language models (LLMs): llama3.1:8b, deepseek-r1:8b, and mistral:latest.\nBy systematically testing temperature values from 0.0 to 1.0 in increments of\n0.1, we conducted 330 trials yielding 889 structured entities, validated for\nsyntactic consistency. Key findings reveal that model architecture\nsignificantly influences computational efficiency, with mistral:latest and\nllama3.1:8b processing data 8x faster than deepseek-r1:8b. Contrary to\nexpectations, temperature showed no correlation with processing time,\nchallenging assumptions about stochastic sampling costs. Output diversity\nremained limited, as models consistently defaulted to common name archetypes\n(e.g., 'John Doe' and 'Jane Smith') across all temperatures, though rare names\nclustered at intermediate values (0.3-0.7). These results demonstrate that\narchitectural optimizations, rather than temperature adjustments, dominate\nperformance in structured generation tasks. The findings emphasize prioritizing\nmodel selection over hyperparameter tuning for efficiency and suggest explicit\ndiversity constraints are necessary to mitigate default output biases in\nsynthetic data pipelines.",

In this study, we explore the feasibility of using nanostructured\nCNTs forest to develop plasma-based accelerators at the 100 TeV/m-level, driven\nby high-density, ultra-relativistic electron beams, using fully\nthree-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Two different acceleration\nmechanisms are proposed and investigated: the surface plasmon leakage field and\nthe bubble wakefield. The leakage field, driven by a relatively low-density\nbeam, can achieve an acceleration field up to TV/m, capable of accelerating\nboth electron and positron beams. In particular, due to the direct acceleration\nby the driver beam, the positron acceleration is highly efficient with an\naverage acceleration gradient of 2.3 TeV/m. In contrast, the bubble wakefield\nmechanism allows significantly higher acceleration fields, e.g. beyond 400\nTV/m, with a much higher energy transfer efficiency of $66.7\\%$. In principle,\nelectrons can be accelerated to PeV energies over distances of several meters.\nIf the beam density is sufficiently high, the CNT target will be completely\nblown out, where no accelerating field is generated. Its threshold has been\nestimated. Two major challenges in these schemes are recognised and\ninvestigated. Leveraging the ultra-high energy and charge pumping rate of the\ndriver beam, the nanostructured CNTs also offer significant potential for a\nwide range of advanced applications. This work represents a promising avenue\nfor the development of ultra-compact, high-energy particle accelerators. We\nalso outline conceptual experiments using currently available facilities,\ndemonstrating that this approach is experimentally accessible.",

    "abstract": "This thesis details a project to define a fully compositional theory of\nsynchronous sequential circuits built from primitive components, motivated by\napplying techniques successfully used in programming languages to hardware.\n  The first part of the thesis defines the syntactic foundations of sequential\ncircuit morphisms, and then builds three different semantic theories:\ndenotational, operational and algebraic. We characterise the denotational\nsemantics of sequential circuits as certain causal stream functions, as well as\nproviding a link to existing circuit methodologies by mapping between circuit\nmorphisms, stream functions and Mealy machines. The operational semantics is\ndefined as a strategy for applying some global transformations followed by\nlocal reductions to demonstrate how a circuit processes a value, leading to a\nnotion of observational equivalence. The algebraic semantics consists of\nequations for bringing circuits into a pseudo-normal form, and then encoding\nbetween different state sets. This part of the thesis concludes with a\ndiscussion of some novel applications, such as those for using partial\nevaluation for digital circuits.\n  While mathematically rigorous, the categorical string diagram formalism is\nnot suited for reasoning computationally. The second part of this thesis\ndetails an extension of string diagram rewriting with hypergraphs so that it is\ncompatible with the traced comonoid structure present in the category of\ndigital circuits. We identify the properties that characterise cospans of\nhypergraphs corresponding to traced comonoid terms, and demonstrate how to\nidentify rewriting contexts valid for rewriting modulo traced comonoid\nstructure. We apply the graph rewriting framework to fixed point operators as\nwell as the operational semantics from the first part, and present a new\nhardware description language based on these theoretical developments.",

Moreover, they often overlook rare but meaningful terms, limiting\ntheir ability to surface early signals or align with expert-driven insights\nessential for strategic understanding. To tackle these gaps, we employ design\nscience research methodology to create a framework that enhances topic modeling\nby weighting aspects based on expert-informed input. It combines expert-curated\nkeywords with topic distributions iteratively to improve topic relevance and\ndocument alignment accuracy in specialized research areas. The framework\ncomprises four phases, including (1) initial topic modeling, (2) expert aspect\ndefinition, (3) supervised document alignment using cosine similarity, and (4)\niterative refinement until convergence. Applied to quantum communication\nresearch, this method improved the visibility of critical but low-frequency\nterms. It also enhanced topic coherence and aligned topics with the\ncryptographic priorities identified by experts. Compared to the baseline model,\nthis framework increased intra-cluster similarity.

By leveraging bottom-up simulations, it replaces costly and\nlogistically challenging traditional experiments with scalable, replicable, and\nsystematic computational approaches for studying complex social dynamics.\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further transformed this\nresearch paradigm, enabling the creation of human-like generative social agents\nand realistic simulacra of society. In this paper, we propose AgentSociety, a\nlarge-scale social simulator that integrates LLM-driven agents, a realistic\nsocietal environment, and a powerful large-scale simulation engine. Based on\nthe proposed simulator, we generate social lives for over 10k agents,\nsimulating their 5 million interactions both among agents and between agents\nand their environment. Furthermore, we explore the potential of AgentSociety as\na testbed for computational social experiments, focusing on four key social\nissues: polarization, the spread of inflammatory messages, the effects of\nuniversal basic income policies, and the impact of external shocks such as\nhurricanes. These four issues serve as valuable cases for assessing\nAgentSociety's support for typical research methods -- such as surveys,\ninterviews, and interventions -- as well as for investigating the patterns,\ncauses, and underlying mechanisms of social issues. The alignment between\nAgentSociety's outcomes and real-world experimental results not only\ndemonstrates its ability to capture human behaviors and their underlying\nmechanisms, but also underscores its potential as an important platform for\nsocial scientists and policymakers.",

To quantitatively characterize the {\\it\nrandomness} of the seasonal $\\text{PM}_{2.5}$ concentration distributions, we\ncompute Shannon entropy, a key information theoretic measure. This allows for\nclassifying cities into different groups, according to the level of randomness\nobserved in their seasonal distributions.

We explicitly describe the\nmethod by which the valuations of the invariants recover the dual graphs.\nAdditionally, we show by way of a counterexample that if $g \\geq 2$, there is\nno list of invariants whose valuations determine the dual graph of the special\nfibre of the minimal regular model of a genus $g$ hyperelliptic curve $C$ over\na local field $K$ of odd residue characteristic when $C$ is not assumed to be\nsemistable.",

    "abstract": "Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) is critical for\necological monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management, requiring\nprecise segmentation of objects in remote sensing imagery guided by textual\ndescriptions. This task is uniquely challenging due to the considerable\nvision-language gap, the high spatial resolution and broad coverage of remote\nsensing imagery with diverse categories and small targets, and the presence of\nclustered, unclear targets with blurred edges. To tackle these issues, we\npropose \\ours, a novel framework designed to bridge the vision-language gap,\nenhance multi-scale feature interaction, and improve fine-grained object\ndifferentiation. Specifically, \\ours introduces: (1) the Bidirectional Spatial\nCorrelation (BSC) for improved vision-language feature alignment, (2) the\nTarget-Background TwinStream Decoder (T-BTD) for precise distinction between\ntargets and non-targets, and (3) the Dual-Modal Object Learning Strategy\n(D-MOLS) for robust multimodal feature reconstruction. Extensive experiments on\nthe benchmark datasets RefSegRS and RRSIS-D demonstrate that \\ours achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance. Specifically, \\ours improves the overall IoU\n(oIoU) by 3.76 percentage points (80.57) and 1.44 percentage points (79.23) on\nthe two datasets, respectively. Additionally, it outperforms previous methods\nin the mean IoU (mIoU) by 5.37 percentage points (67.95) and 1.84 percentage\npoints (66.04), effectively addressing the core challenges of RRSIS with\nenhanced precision and robustness.",

Multiple\nresearch works have proposed synchronization algorithms for LoRa under\ndifferent hardware impairments. However, the impact of sampling frequency\noffset (SFO) has mostly either been ignored or tracked only during the data\nphase, but it often harms synchronization. In this work, we extend existing\nsynchronization algorithms for LoRa to estimate and compensate SFO already in\nthe preamble and show that this early compensation has a critical impact on the\nestimation of other impairments such as carrier frequency offset and sampling\ntime offset. Therefore it is critical to recover long-range signals.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that\nLooped Transformers possess remarkable length generalization capabilities, but\ntheir limited generality and adaptability prevent them from serving as an\nalternative to auto-regressive solutions. To better leverage the strengths of\nLooped Transformers, we propose RELAY (REasoning through Loop Alignment\niterativelY). Specifically, we align the steps of Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nreasoning with loop iterations and apply intermediate supervision during the\ntraining of Looped Transformers. This additional iteration-wise supervision not\nonly preserves the Looped Transformer's ability for length generalization but\nalso enables it to predict CoT reasoning steps for unseen data. Therefore, we\nleverage this Looped Transformer to generate accurate reasoning chains for\ncomplex problems that exceed the training length, which will then be used to\nfine-tune an auto-regressive model. We conduct extensive experiments, and the\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with significant\nimprovements in the performance of the auto-regressive model.

The first\nexcursion shows how repeated and varying pressing movements on the already\nheld-down key of a computer keyboard can be used both to simplify existing user\ninteractions and to implement new ones, that allow the rapid yet detailed\nnavigation of multiple possible interaction outcomes. The second excursion\nshows that automated computational techniques can display shape specifically in\nthe retinal afterimage, a well-known effect in the human visual system.",

In the paper \"The Signature Kernel is the solution of a\nGoursat PDE\", the authors identify a kernel trick that demonstrates that, for\ncontinuously differentiable paths, the signature kernel satisfies a Goursat\nproblem for a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) in two independent\ntime variables. While finite difference methods have been explored for this\nPDE, they face limitations in accuracy and stability when handling highly\noscillatory inputs. In this work, we introduce two advanced numerical schemes\nthat leverage polynomial representations of boundary conditions through either\napproximation or interpolation techniques, and rigorously establish the\ntheoretical convergence of the polynomial approximation scheme. Experimental\nevaluations reveal that our approaches yield improvements of several orders of\nmagnitude in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to traditional\nfinite difference schemes, without increasing computational complexity.\nFurthermore, like finite difference methods, our algorithms can be\nGPU-parallelized to reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linear in\nthe length of the input sequences, thereby improving scalability for\nhigh-frequency data. We have implemented these algorithms in a dedicated Python\nlibrary, which is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/FrancescoPiatti/polysigkernel.",

However, the limited labeled multimodal data\noften hinders embedding performance. Recent approaches have leveraged data\nsynthesis to address this problem, yet the quality of synthetic data remains a\ncritical bottleneck. In this work, we identify three criteria for high-quality\nsynthetic multimodal data. First, broad scope ensures that the generated data\ncovers diverse tasks and modalities, making it applicable to various downstream\nscenarios. Second, robust cross-modal alignment makes different modalities\nsemantically consistent. Third, high fidelity ensures that the synthetic data\nmaintains realistic details to enhance its reliability. Guided by these\nprinciples, we synthesize datasets that: (1) cover a wide range of tasks,\nmodality combinations, and languages, (2) are generated via a deep thinking\nprocess within a single pass of a multimodal large language model, and (3)\nincorporate real-world images with accurate and relevant texts, ensuring\nfidelity through self-evaluation and refinement. Leveraging these high-quality\nsynthetic and labeled datasets, we train a multimodal multilingual E5 model\nmmE5. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mmE5 achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on the MMEB Benchmark and superior multilingual performance on the\nXTD benchmark.

However, despite their minimal contribution to total inference time\nand floating-point operations (FLOPs), text encoders demand significantly\nhigher memory usage, up to eight times more than denoising modules. To address\nthis inefficiency, we propose Skip and Re-use layers (Skrr), a simple yet\neffective pruning strategy specifically designed for text encoders in T2I\ndiffusion models. Skrr exploits the inherent redundancy in transformer blocks\nby selectively skipping or reusing certain layers in a manner tailored for T2I\ntasks, thereby reducing memory consumption without compromising performance.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Skrr maintains image quality comparable\nto the original model even under high sparsity levels, outperforming existing\nblockwise pruning methods.

None of the previous\napproaches are applicable in this scenario, known as blind XSS (BXSS). In this\npaper, we address this problem and present the first comprehensive study on\nBXSS.

Seven of these polyglots are already sufficient to cover a\nstate-of-the-art XSS testbed. In a validation on real-world client-side\nvulnerabilities, we show that their XSS detection rate is on par with existing\ntaint tracking approaches. Based on these polyglots, we conduct a study of BXSS\nvulnerabilities on the Tranco Top 100,000 websites. We discover 20\nvulnerabilities in 18 web-based backend systems.

During low-throughput, Morpheus exhibits\ncompetitive complexity and lower latency than standard protocols such as PBFT\nand Tendermint, which in turn do not perform well during high-throughput.\n  The key idea of Morpheus is that as long as blocks do not conflict (due to\nByzantine behaviour, network delays, or high-throughput simultaneous\nproduction) it produces a forkless blockchain, promptly finalizing each block\nupon arrival. It assigns a leader only if one is needed to resolve conflicts,\nin a manner and with performance not unlike Autobahn.",

This enables us to reformulate the problem to two decoupled\nevolution equations at each enrichment step, of which one is a\nparameter-independent partial differential equation and the other one is a\nparameter-dependent ordinary differential equation. These equations are\ndirectly derived from the original dynamical system and the previously separate\nrepresentation terms. Moreover, the computational process of the proposed\nmethod can be split into an offline stage, in which the reduced basis functions\nare constructed, and an online stage, in which the efficient low-rank\nrepresentation of the solution is employed. The proposed dynamical\nVariable-separation method is capable of offering reduced computational\ncomplexity and enhanced efficiency compared to many existing low-rank\nseparation techniques.

Concomitant abrupt changes in the dust\nconcentrations of the same ice cores suggest that sudden reorganisations of the\nhemispheric-scale atmospheric circulation have accompanied the warming events.\nGenuine bistability of the North Atlantic climate system is commonly\nhypothesised to explain the existence of stadial (cold) and interstadial\n(milder) periods in Greenland.

Specifically, we first introduce the interaction-aware\npoint clouds, which establish correspondences between the object and the hand.\nThese point clouds are then used for our pre-training policy, where we also\nincorporate object-centric contact maps and hand-arm coordination information,\neffectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics.

We propose Monge SAM (M-SAM), a\nreparametrization invariant version of SAM by considering a Riemannian metric\nin the parameter space induced naturally by the loss surface. Compared to\nprevious approaches, M-SAM works under any modeling choice, relies only on mild\nassumptions while being as computationally efficient as SAM.

However, the Serializable API has a long\nhistory of deserialization vulnerabilities, specifically deserialization gadget\nchains. Research endeavors have been heavily directed towards the detection of\ndeserialization gadget chains on the Java platform. Yet, there is little\nknowledge about the existence of gadget chains within the Android platform. We\naim to close this gap by searching gadget chains in the Android SDK, Android's\nofficial development libraries, as well as frequently used third-party\nlibraries. To handle this large dataset, we design a gadget chain detection\ntool optimized for soundness and efficiency. In a benchmark on the full\nYsoserial dataset, it achieves similarly sound results to the state-of-the-art\nin significantly less time. Using our tool, we first show that the Android SDK\ncontains almost the same trampoline gadgets as the Java Class Library. We also\nfind that one can trigger Java native serialization through Android's Parcel\nAPI. Yet, running our tool on the Android SDK and 1,200 Android dependencies,\nin combination with a comprehensive sink dataset, yields no security-critical\ngadget chains. This result opposes the general notion of Java deserialization\ngadget chains being a widespread problem.

We find that, for an LSST-like source galaxy\ndensity, our constraints are robust to changes in the concentration-mass\nrelation and dark matter density profile modeling choices, when source\nredshifts and shapes are perfectly known.

Several methods have been\nproposed in the statistical literature to validate putative surrogate\nendpoints. Two main approaches have been proposed: the meta-analytic approach\nand the mediation analysis approach. The former uses data from meta-analyses to\nderive associations measures between the surrogate and the final endpoint at\nthe individual and trial levels. The latter rather uses the proportion of the\ntreatment effect on the final endpoint through the surrogate as a measure of\nsurrogacy in a causal inference framework. Both approaches have remained\nseparated as the meta-analytic approach does not estimate the treatment effect\non the final endpoint through the surrogate while the mediation analysis\napproach have been limited to single-trial setting. However, these two\napproaches are complementary. In this work we propose an approach that combines\nthe meta-analytic and mediation analysis approaches using joint modeling for\nsurrogate validation. We focus on the cases where the final endpoint is a\ntime-to-event endpoint (such as time-to-death) and the surrogate is either a\ntime-to-event or a longitudinal biomarker. Two new joint models were proposed\ndepending on the nature of the surrogate. These model are implemented in the R\npackage frailtypack.

Such a phenomenon has been\nfound assuming a Gaussian noise source, delta-correlated both in time and\nspace. In light of the potential implications of this generation technique,\ne.g., for the experimental observation of breathers in long Josephson\njunctions, it is physically motivated to investigate the effects of more\nrealistic noise sources with finite correlation time and/or correlation length.\nHere, breathers are demonstrated to still emerge under this broader class of\nnoise sources. The correlation time and the correlation length are found to\noffer control over the probability of observing breathers, as well on the\ntypical timescale for their emergence. In particular, our results show that, as\ncompared to the thermal case, the temporal and spatial correlations in the\nnoise can lead to a larger breather-only occurrence frequency, i.e., the latter\nquantity behaves nonmonotonically versus both the correlation time and the\ncorrelation length. Overall, noise correlations represent a powerful tool for\ncontrolling the excitation of the elusive breather modes in view of\nexperiments.",

To study this under-explored task, we curate a dataset,\nCSTBIR (Composite Sketch+Text Based Image Retrieval), consisting of approx. 2M\nqueries and 108K natural scene images. Further, as a solution to this problem,\nwe propose a pretrained multimodal transformer-based baseline, STNET\n(Sketch+Text Network), that uses a hand-drawn sketch to localize relevant\nobjects in the natural scene image, and encodes the text and image to perform\nimage retrieval.

    "abstract": "Recent observations of $\\delta$ Scuti stars find evidence of nonlinear\nthree-mode coupling in their oscillation spectra. There are two types of\nthree-mode coupling likely to be important in $\\delta$ Scuti stars: (i) direct\ncoupling, in which two linearly unstable modes (driven by the kappa-mechanism)\nexcite a linearly stable mode, and (ii) parametric coupling, in which one\nlinearly unstable mode excites two linearly stable modes. Breger & Montgomery\n(2014) find especially strong evidence of direct coupling in the $\\delta$ Scuti\nstar KIC 8054146. However, direct coupling is inherently unstable and cannot be\nthe mechanism by which the modes saturate and achieve nonlinear equilibrium. By\nintegrating the amplitude equations of small mode networks, we show that the\nmodes can achieve equilibrium if parametric coupling operates in tandem with\ndirect coupling. Using mode parameters calculated from a $\\delta$ Scuti model,\nwe also find that parametric and direct coupling are likely to be\nsimultaneously active. Importantly, parametric coupling does not necessarily\ndisrupt the correlations found in KIC 8054146 between the amplitudes and phases\nof the directly coupled modes. We conclude that $\\delta$ Scuti stars are likely\nimpacted by both parametric and direct coupling and that accounting for both in\nfuture large mode network calculations may help explain the complicated mode\ndynamics observed in many $\\delta$ Scuti stars.",

Therefore, HyFi is able to produce highquality\nembeddings, and outperforms both supervised and unsupervised baselines in\naverage rank on node classification across 10 datasets.

    "abstract": "The field of music generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) is evolving\nrapidly, yet existing music notation systems, such as MIDI, ABC Notation, and\nMusicXML, remain too complex for effective fine-tuning of LLMs. These formats\nare difficult for both machines and humans to interpret due to their\nvariability and intricate structure. To address these challenges, we introduce\nYNote, a simplified music notation system that uses only four characters to\nrepresent a note and its pitch. YNote's fixed format ensures consistency,\nmaking it easy to read and more suitable for fine-tuning LLMs. In our\nexperiments, we fine-tuned GPT-2 (124M) on a YNote-encoded dataset and achieved\nBLEU and ROUGE scores of 0.883 and 0.766, respectively. With just two notes as\nprompts, the model was able to generate coherent and stylistically relevant\nmusic. We believe YNote offers a practical alternative to existing music\nnotations for machine learning applications and has the potential to\nsignificantly enhance the quality of music generation using LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Molecular communication (MC) provides a foundational framework for\ninformation transmission in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), where\nefficiency and reliability are crucial. However, the inherent limitations of\nmolecular channels, such as low transmission rates, noise, and intersymbol\ninterference (ISI), limit their ability to support complex data transmission.\nThis paper proposes an end-to-end semantic learning framework designed to\noptimize task-oriented molecular communication, with a focus on biomedical\ndiagnostic tasks under resource-constrained conditions. The proposed framework\nemploys a deep encoder-decoder architecture to efficiently extract, quantize,\nand decode semantic features, prioritizing taskrelevant semantic information to\nenhance diagnostic classification performance. Additionally, a probabilistic\nchannel network is introduced to approximate molecular propagation dynamics,\nenabling gradient-based optimization for end-to-end learning. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed semantic framework improves diagnostic\naccuracy by at least 25% compared to conventional JPEG compression with LDPC\ncoding methods under resource-constrained communication scenarios.",

The vision for quantum\nnetworks involves the efficient distribution and utilization of quantum\nresources across a network to support a variety of quantum applications.\nHowever, current quantum protocols often develop independently, leading to\nincompatibilities that limit the functional scalability of the network. In this\npaper, we showcase a compatible and complementary implementation of two\ndistinct quantum applications, quantum time synchronization and quantum\ncryptography, by multiplexing the same energy-time entangled biphotons and\nquantum channel. A proof-of-principle experiment between two independent nodes\nacross a 120 km fiber-optic link is demonstrated, which achieve sub-picosecond\nsynchronization stability based on the quantum two-way time transfer protocol.\nSimultaneously, this synchronization provides the required timing for\nimplementing dispersive-optic quantum key distribution with an average\nfinite-size secure key rate of 73.8 bits per second, which can be employed to\nsafeguard the security of the transferred timing data. Furthermore, thanks to\nthe compatibility, potential asymmetric delay attacks in the link, which are\ndetrimental to the accomplishment of secure key distribution, can be\neffectively mitigated by the parallel quantum time synchronization procedure.\nOur demonstration marks a substantial leap towards unlocking the full potential\nof energy-time entanglement and paves the way for a resource-efficient,\nfunction-scalable, and highly compatible quantum network.",

However, cross-subject variability remains a critical challenge,\nparticularly for BCI-illiterate users who struggle to effectively interact with\nthese systems. To address this issue, we propose the Class-Sensitive\nSubject-to-Subject Semantic Style Transfer Network (CSSSTN), which incorporates\na class-sensitive approach to align feature distributions between golden\nsubjects (BCI experts) and target (BCI-illiterate) users on a class-by-class\nbasis. Building on the SSSTN framework, CSSSTN incorporates three key\ncomponents: (1) subject-specific classifier training, (2) a unique style loss\nto transfer class-discriminative features while preserving semantic information\nthrough a modified content loss, and (3) an ensemble approach to integrate\npredictions from both source and target domains. We evaluated CSSSTN using both\na publicly available dataset and a self-collected dataset. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that CSSSTN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean\nbalanced accuracy improvements of 6.4\\% on the Tsinghua dataset and 3.5\\% on\nthe HDU dataset, with notable benefits for BCI-illiterate users.

Additionally, CSSSTN\nachieves competitive results with minimal target data, reducing calibration\ntime and effort. These findings highlight the practical potential of CSSSTN for\nreal-world BCI applications, offering a robust and scalable solution to improve\nthe performance of BCI-illiterate users while minimizing reliance on extensive\ntraining data.

While successful in\nnonrelativistic contexts, its extension to curved spacetime-and hence quantum\ngravity-remains unresolved. Here, we develop a covariant extension of Bohmian\nmechanics in curved spacetime that removes the need for metric quantization.\nFrom a Lagrangian formulation, we derive a generalized guidance equation in\nwhich Bohmian trajectories generate hidden curvature, replacing metric\nsuperposition with a statistical ensemble constrained by Heisenberg\nuncertainty, offering a novel perspective on quantum gravity. Consequently, in\nour approach, measuring the gravitational potential at a point unveils a\npre-existing trajectory and its associated curvature-a departure from the\nobserver-centric paradigm of standard quantum mechanics-providing an\nalternative in which gravitational effects emerge from deterministic quantum\ntrajectories rather than wavefunction collapse. Numerical simulations in\nRobertson-Walker and cigar soliton spacetimes reveal that while quantum\ninterference is curvature-sensitive, Zitterbewegung remains invariant,\ndistinguishing fundamental quantum effects. Moreover, deviations from the Born\nrule in inhomogeneous spacetimes are observed and suggest gravity-induced\nquantum non-equilibrium.

Minimal models are used, which characterize the\nswimmer type only by boundary conditions. We calculate the swimming velocities,\nthe dissipated power and the Lighthill efficiencies within a second order\nperturbation expansion in the small deformation amplitudes. %Our approach uses\nspherical harmonics to represent surface deformations and a system of general\nsolutions of the Stokes equation based on vector spherical harmonics. For solid\nbodies, we reproduce older results by Lighthill and Blake, for vesicles and for\ndroplets we add new results. The unified approach allows for a detailed\ncomparison between the three types of microswimmers. We present such\ncomparisons for swim strokes made up of spherical harmonics of adjacent orders\n$l$ and $l+1$, as well as for a manifold of swim strokes, made up of spherical\nharmonics up to order $l=4$, which respect volume- and\nsurface-incompressibility. This manifold is two-dimensional, which allows to\npresent swimming velocities and efficiencies in a compact graphical form. In a\nrace in which each swimmer can choose the stroke that maximizes its speed, the\ndroplet always comes in first, the vesicle comes in second, while the particle\nfinishes third. However, if the three swimmers perform the same stroke, other\norder of rankings become possible. The maximum of the total efficiency of a\ndroplet is greater than that of a vesicle if the internal dissipation is small.\nThe efficiency of the solid body turns out to be typically two orders of\nmagnitude smaller than that of vesicles and droplets.

In light of Arrow's impossibility\ntheorem, acquiring information about agent preferences through some form of\nfeedback is necessary. We assume that the central planner can request powerful\nbut expensive audits on the winner in any round, revealing the true utility of\nthe winner in that round. We design a mechanism achieving $T$-independent\n$O(K^2)$ social welfare regret while only requesting $O(K^3 \\log T)$ audits in\nexpectation, where $K$ is the number of agents and $T$ is the number of rounds.\nWe also show an $\\Omega(K)$ lower bound on the regret and an $\\Omega(1)$ lower\nbound on the number of audits when having low regret. Algorithmically, we show\nthat incentive-compatibility can be mostly enforced via the imposition of\nadaptive future punishments, where the audit probability is inversely\nproportional to the winner's future winning probability. To accurately estimate\nsuch probabilities in presence of strategic agents, who may adversely react to\nany potential misestimate, we introduce a flagging component that allows agents\nto flag any biased estimate (we show that doing so aligns with individual\nincentives). On the technical side, without a unique and known distribution,\none cannot apply the revelation principle and conclude that truthful reporting\nis exactly an equilibrium. Instead, we characterize the equilibrium via a\nreduction to a simpler auxiliary game, in which agents cannot strategize until\nclose to the end of the game; we show equilibria in this game can induce\nequilibria in the actual, fully strategic game. The tools developed therein may\nbe of independent interest for other mechanism design problems in which the\nrevelation principle cannot be readily applied.",

Due to the unsupervised nature of\nclustering, achieving global optimality is crucial, yet computationally\nchallenging.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are helping millions of users write texts about\ndiverse issues, and in doing so expose users to different ideas and\nperspectives. This creates concerns about issue bias, where an LLM tends to\npresent just one perspective on a given issue, which in turn may influence how\nusers think about this issue. So far, it has not been possible to measure which\nissue biases LLMs manifest in real user interactions, making it difficult to\naddress the risks from biased LLMs. Therefore, we create IssueBench: a set of\n2.49m realistic English-language prompts to measure issue bias in LLM writing\nassistance, which we construct based on 3.9k templates (e.g. \"write a blog\nabout\") and 212 political issues (e.g. \"AI regulation\") from real user\ninteractions. Using IssueBench, we show that issue biases are common and\npersistent in 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. We also show that biases are very\nsimilar across models, and that all models align more with US Democrat than\nRepublican voter opinion on a subset of issues. IssueBench can easily be\nadapted to include other issues, templates, or tasks. By enabling robust and\nrealistic measurement, we hope that IssueBench can bring a new quality of\nevidence to ongoing discussions about LLM biases and how to address them.",

Here, we show how ultra-fast\nmachine-learned interatomic potentials, based on the atomic cluster expansion\n(ACE) framework, enable simulations of PCMs reflecting applications in devices\nwith excellent scalability on high-performance computing platforms. We report\nfull-cycle simulations -- including the time-consuming crystallisation process\n(from digital \"zeroes\" to \"ones\") -- thus representing the entire programming\ncycle for cross-point memory devices. We also showcase a simulation of\nfull-cycle operations, relevant to neuromorphic computing, in a mushroom-type\ndevice geometry.

    "abstract": "Multiple instance learning (MIL)-based framework has become the mainstream\nfor processing the whole slide image (WSI) with giga-pixel size and\nhierarchical image context in digital pathology. However, these methods heavily\ndepend on a substantial number of bag-level labels and solely learn from the\noriginal slides, which are easily affected by variations in data distribution.\nRecently, vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language\nprior by pre-training on large-scale pathological image-text pairs. However,\nthe previous text prompt lacks the consideration of pathological prior\nknowledge, therefore does not substantially boost the model's performance.\nMoreover, the collection of such pairs and the pre-training process are very\ntime-consuming and source-intensive.To solve the above problems, we propose a\ndual-scale vision-language multiple instance learning (ViLa-MIL) framework for\nwhole slide image classification. Specifically, we propose a dual-scale visual\ndescriptive text prompt based on the frozen large language model (LLM) to boost\nthe performance of VLM effectively. To transfer the VLM to process WSI\nefficiently, for the image branch, we propose a prototype-guided patch decoder\nto aggregate the patch features progressively by grouping similar patches into\nthe same prototype; for the text branch, we introduce a context-guided text\ndecoder to enhance the text features by incorporating the multi-granular image\ncontexts. Extensive studies on three multi-cancer and multi-center subtyping\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of ViLa-MIL.",

One\ncan find that the correlation parameter (a, alpha), along with the observer's\ninclination angle, affect the image's asymmetry and the distortion of the inner\nshadow. As the inclination increases, the direct and lensed images diverge,\ncreating a structure resembling a hat. Meanwhile, we also investigate the\nredshift distribution of the direct lensed images of the accretion disk under\ndifferent parameters and observation angle. The results show that the\ndistribution of redshift and observed intensity is obviously related to the\nbehavior of accretion flow.

However, the massive parameter scale of LLMs\nposes significant challenges in deploying them on edge devices due to high\ncomputational and storage demands. Considering that the sparse activation in\nMixture of Experts (MoE) is effective on scalable and dynamic allocation of\ncomputational and communications resources at the edge, this paper proposes a\nnovel MoE-empowered collaborative deployment framework for edge LLMs, denoted\nas CoEL. This framework fully leverages the properties of MoE architecture and\nencompasses four key aspects: Perception, Deployment, Compression, and\nUpdating. Edge servers broadcast their resource status and the specific\nresource requirements of LLMs to their neighbors. Then, utilizing this data,\ntwo sophisticated deployment strategies are proposed for satisfying varying\nmodel scales, ensuring that each model is deployed effectively. One for\ndeploying LLMs on a single edge device through intra-device resource\ncollaboration, and another for a distributed deployment across multiple edge\ndevices via inter-device resource collaboration. Furthermore, both the models\nand the intermediate data are compressed for reducing memory footprint by\nquantization and reducing the volume of intermediate data by token fusion and\npruning. Finally, given the dynamic of network topology, resource status, and\nuser requirements, the deployment strategies are regularly updated to maintain\nits relevance and effectiveness.

Along temporal axes, it\nregards the regions of current frame features that possess significant\ndifferences relative to reference frame features as dynamic features.\nConversely, the remaining parts are the static features. Then, we acquire\ndecoupled features driven by dynamic features and current frame features.\nMoreover, to further enhance the dynamic representation of decoupled features\nfrom different viewpoints and ensure accurate motion prediction, we design a\ntemporal-spatial similarity fusion module (TSSF).

A key step toward developing trustworthy COD systems is\nthe estimation and effective utilization of uncertainty. In this work, we\npropose a human-machine collaboration framework for classifying the presence of\ncamouflaged objects, leveraging the complementary strengths of computer vision\n(CV) models and noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Our approach\nintroduces a multiview backbone to estimate uncertainty in CV model\npredictions, utilizes this uncertainty during training to improve efficiency,\nand defers low-confidence cases to human evaluation via RSVP-based BCIs during\ntesting for more reliable decision-making. We evaluated the framework in the\nCAMO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results with an average improvement of\n4.56\\% in balanced accuracy (BA) and 3.66\\% in the F1 score compared to\nexisting methods. For the best-performing participants, the improvements\nreached 7.6\\% in BA and 6.66\\% in the F1 score. Analysis of the training\nprocess revealed a strong correlation between our confidence measures and\nprecision, while an ablation study confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed\ntraining policy and the human-machine collaboration strategy. In general, this\nwork reduces human cognitive load, improves system reliability, and provides a\nstrong foundation for advancements in real-world COD applications and\nhuman-computer interaction.

We show that such a configuration\nallows for faster image acquisition than its time-domain configuration,\nproviding a step forward towards a practical and competitive solution in the\nOCT arena.

In particular, dimensional and domain decomposition\nsplittings are considered for partitioning the elliptic operator, and\nfirst-order splitting time integrators are chosen as the propagators of the\nparareal algorithm to solve the resulting split problem. The major contribution\nof these methods is that, not only does the fine propagator perform in\nparallel, but also the coarse propagator. Unlike the classical version of the\nparareal algorithm, where all processors remain idle during the coarse\npropagator computations, the newly proposed schemes utilize the computational\ncores for both integrators. A convergence analysis of the methods is provided,\nand several numerical experiments are performed to test the solvers under\nconsideration.",

The seller supports or favors a\nspecific group, referred to as the minority group. Specifically, the seller\nrequires that allocations to the minority group are at least a predetermined\nfraction (equity level) of those made to the rest of the bidders. Such\nconstraints arise in various settings, including government procurement and\ncorporate supply chain policies that prioritize small businesses,\nenvironmentally responsible suppliers, or enterprises owned by historically\ndisadvantaged individuals. We analyze two variants of this problem: stochastic\nmechanism design, which assumes bidders' values follow a known distribution and\nseeks to maximize expected revenue, and regret-based mechanism design, which\nmakes no distributional assumptions and aims to minimize the worst-case regret.\nWe characterize a closed-form optimal stochastic mechanism and propose a\nclosed-form regret-based mechanism, and establish that the ex-post regret under\nthe latter is at most a constant multiple (dependent on the equity level) of\nthe optimal worst-case regret. We further quantify that this approximation\nconstant is at most 1.31 across different equity levels. Both mechanisms can be\ninterpreted as set-asides, a common policy tool that reserves a fraction of\ngoods for minority groups.

The other\nadvantage of the SEEMD method is its success in dealing with non-Gaussian or\nnon-stationary perturbing signals. In SEEMD, initially, a fractional Gaussian\nnoise (FGN) is added to the raw signal to emphasize on high frequencies of the\nsignal. Then, a convoluted white Gaussian noise is multiplied to the resulting\nsignal which changes the spectral content of the signal which helps in\nextraction of the weak periodic signal. Finally, the obtained signal is\ndecomposed by using a single sifting process. The proposed methodology is\napplied to the raw signals obtained from the mining industry. These signals are\ndifficult to analyze since cyclic impulsive components are obscured by noise\nand other interference.

Lag\nestimates obtained using Javelin and PyROA are consistent with each other and\nyield accretion disc sizes a factor of ~2-7 larger than `thin disc' theoretical\nexpectations. This makes 3C 273 one of a growing number of active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) to display the so-called `accretion disc size' problem usually\nobserved in low-luminosity AGN. Power-law fits of the form tau~lambda^beta to\nthe lag spectrum, and nufnu ~ nu^beta to the spectral energy distribution (SED)\nof the variations, both give results consistent with the `thin disc'\ntheoretical expectation of beta=4/3. The Starkey et al. `flat disc with a steep\nrim' model can fit both the lag estimates and the SED variations. Extrapolating\nthe observed optical lags to putative dust-forming regions of the disc gives\nr~100-200 light-days. These radii are consistent with the size of the broad\nline region (BLR) as determined by near-infrared interferometric studies as\nwell as with the best-fit location of the outer edge for the `flat disc with a\nsteep rim' model. Therefore, the accretion disc in 3C 273 might be sufficiently\nextended to be dusty, allowing the BLR to emerge from it in a dusty outflow.

A popular approach, called task-agnostic\nexploration, casts the unsupervised objective as maximizing the entropy of the\nstate distribution induced by the agent's policy, from which principles and\nmethods follow.\n  In contrast, little is known about it in multi-agent settings, which are\nubiquitous in the real world.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive study of the eclipse properties of the\nspider millisecond pulsar (MSP) J1908$+$2105, using wide-band observations from\nthe uGMRT and Parkes UWL. For the first time, we observed that this pulsar\nexhibits extended eclipses up to 4 GHz, the highest frequency band of the UWL,\nmaking it one of only three MSPs known to have such high-frequency eclipses.\nThis study reveals synchrotron absorption as the primary eclipse mechanism for\nJ1908$+$2105. We present modeling of synchrotron optical depth with various\npossible combinations of the parameters to explain the observed eclipsing in\nthis as well as other spider MSPs. Observed eclipses at unusually high\nfrequencies for J1908$+$2105 significantly aided in constraining the magnetic\nfield and electron column density in the eclipse medium while modeling the\nsynchrotron optical depth. Combining our findings with data from other MSPs in\nthe literature, for the first time we note that a higher cutoff frequency of\neclipsing, particularly above 1 GHz, is consistently associated with a higher\nelectron column density ($>$ 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$) in the eclipse medium.\nAdditionally, we present the first evidence of lensing effects near eclipse\nboundaries in this MSP, leading to significant magnification of radio\nemissions. The orbital phase resolved polarization analysis presented in this\npaper further indicates variation in rotation measure and consequently stronger\nmagnetic fields in the eclipse region.",

    "abstract": "Price Trend Prediction (PTP) based on Limit Order Book (LOB) data is a\nfundamental challenge in financial markets. Despite advances in deep learning,\nexisting models fail to generalize across different market conditions and\nassets. Surprisingly, by adapting a simple MLP-based architecture to LOB, we\nshow that we surpass SoTA performance; thus, challenging the necessity of\ncomplex architectures. Unlike past work that shows robustness issues, we\npropose TLOB, a transformer-based model that uses a dual attention mechanism to\ncapture spatial and temporal dependencies in LOB data. This allows it to\nadaptively focus on the market microstructure, making it particularly effective\nfor longer-horizon predictions and volatile market conditions. We also\nintroduce a new labeling method that improves on previous ones, removing the\nhorizon bias. We evaluate TLOB's effectiveness across four horizons, using the\nestablished FI-2010 benchmark, a NASDAQ and a Bitcoin dataset. TLOB outperforms\nSoTA methods in every dataset and horizon. Additionally, we empirically show\nhow stock price predictability has declined over time, -6.68 in F1-score,\nhighlighting the growing market efficiency. Predictability must be considered\nin relation to transaction costs, so we experimented with defining trends using\nan average spread, reflecting the primary transaction cost. The resulting\nperformance deterioration underscores the complexity of translating trend\nclassification into profitable trading strategies. We argue that our work\nprovides new insights into the evolving landscape of stock price trend\nprediction and sets a strong foundation for future advancements in financial\nAI.

While RAG\nenhances response relevance by incorporating retrieved domain knowledge in the\ncontext, retrieval errors can still lead to hallucinations and incorrect\nanswers. To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by\nfine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of\nretrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge\naugmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to\nextract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work,\nwe present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning\nprocess by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and\nknowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training\nsamples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved\ninformation, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved\ncontent. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the\nsame question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To\nmitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific\nidentifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA\npairs.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with\nits high spatial resolution and good spectral resolution, provides unique\naccess to the detection of these molecules. Our goal is to use the first\ndetection of CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational emission in the Orion Bar and in\nthe protoplanetary disk d203-506, irradiated by the Trapezium cluster, to probe\ntheir formation and excitation mechanisms and constrain the physico-chemical\nconditions. We use spectro-imaging acquired using both the NIRSpec and MIRI-MRS\ninstruments to study the CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ spatial distribution at very small\nscales, and compare it to excited H$_2$ emission. CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ emissions\noriginate from the same region as highly excited H$_2$. Our comparison between\nthe Bar and d203-506 reveals that both CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ excitation and/or\nformation are highly dependent on gas density. The excitation temperature of\nthe observed CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational lines is around $T$ ~ 1500 K in\nthe Bar and $T$ ~ 800 K in d203-506. Moreover, the column densities derived\nfrom the rovibrational emission are less than 0.1 % of the total known (CH$^+$)\nand expected (CH$_3^+$) column densities. These results show that CH$^+$ and\nCH$_3^+$ level populations strongly deviate from ETL. CH$^+$ rovibrational\nemission can be explained by chemical formation pumping with excited H$_2$ via\nC$^+$ + H$_2^*$ = CH$^+$ + H. These results support a gas phase formation\npathway of CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ via successive hydrogen abstraction reactions.\nHowever, we do not find any evidence of CH$_2^+$ emission in the JWST spectrum.\nFinally, observed CH$^+$ intensities coupled with chemical formation pumping\nmodel provide a diagnostic tool to trace the local density.",

We show that reaction at the interface\nfollows a surface-mediated `In and Out' mechanism: CO$_2$ diffuses into the\naqueous surface layer, reacts to form carbonic acid, and is subsequently\nexpelled from solution. We show that this surface layer provides a bulk-like\nsolvation environment, engendering similar modes of reactivity and\nnear-identical free energy profiles for the bulk and interfacial processes. Our\nstudy unveils a new, unconventional reaction mechanism that underscores the\ndynamic nature of the molecular reaction site at the air-water interface. The\nsimilarity between bulk and interfacial profiles shows that CO$_2$ hydration is\nequally as feasible under these two solvation environments and that\nacidification rates are likely enhanced by this additional surface\ncontribution.",

Pre-training Vision Transformer (ViT) through masked image modeling\n(MIM) on large-scale unlabeled medical datasets presents a promising solution,\nproviding both computational efficiency and model generalization for various\ndownstream tasks.

To fill the above gap, we hereby present Hierarchical\nEncoder-driven MAE (Hi-End-MAE), a simple yet effective ViT-based pre-training\nsolution, which centers on two key innovations: (1) Encoder-driven\nreconstruction, which encourages the encoder to learn more informative features\nto guide the reconstruction of masked patches; and (2) Hierarchical dense\ndecoding, which implements a hierarchical decoding structure to capture rich\nrepresentations across different layers. We pre-train Hi-End-MAE on a\nlarge-scale dataset of 10K CT scans and evaluated its performance across seven\npublic medical image segmentation benchmarks.

Mathematically, this situation is implemented by a map from the\ndriver state space to the responder state space termed the synchronization map.\nIn nonlinear times series analysis, the framework of the present work, the\nexistence of the synchronization map amounts to the invertibility of the\nso-called cross map, which is a continuous map that exists in the reconstructed\nstate spaces for typical time-delay embeddings. The cross map plays a central\nrole in some techniques to detect functional dependencies between time series.\nIn this paper, we study the changes in the \\textquotedblleft noiseless\nscenario\\textquotedblright\\ just described when noise is present in the driver,\na more realistic situation that we call the \\textquotedblleft noisy\nscenario\\textquotedblright . Noise will be modeled using a family of driving\ndynamics indexed by a finite number of parameters, which is sufficiently\ngeneral for practical purposes.

However, during the global partition\nphase, misclusterings within subgraphs have a tendency to progressively\ncompound throughout the multi-step decoding process of the learning-based\npartition policy. This suboptimal behavior in the global partition phase, in\nturn, may lead to a dramatic deterioration in the performance of the overall\ndecomposition-based system, despite using optimal local constructions. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a versatile Hierarchical Learning-based\nGraph Partition (HLGP) framework, which is tailored to benefit the partition of\nCVRP instances by synergistically integrating global and local partition\npolicies. Specifically, the global partition policy is tasked with creating the\ncoarse multi-way partition to generate the sequence of simpler two-way\npartition subtasks. These subtasks mark the initiation of the subsequent K\nlocal partition levels. At each local partition level, subtasks exclusive for\nthis level are assigned to the local partition policy which benefits from the\ninsensitive local topological features to incrementally alleviate the\ncompounded errors.

As a result, agents may deviate from the optimal\nbehaviors learned during training, thereby hindering visual generalization.To\naddress this issue, we propose the Salience-Invariant Consistent Policy\nLearning (SCPL) algorithm, an efficient framework for zero-shot generalization.\nOur approach introduces a novel value consistency module alongside a dynamics\nmodule to effectively capture task-relevant representations. The value\nconsistency module, guided by saliency, ensures the agent focuses on\ntask-relevant pixels in both original and perturbed observations, while the\ndynamics module uses augmented data to help the encoder capture dynamic- and\nreward-relevant representations. Additionally, our theoretical analysis\nhighlights the importance of policy consistency for generalization. To\nstrengthen this, we introduce a policy consistency module with a KL divergence\nconstraint to maintain consistent policies across original and perturbed\nobservations.Extensive experiments on the DMC-GB, Robotic Manipulation, and\nCARLA benchmarks demonstrate that SCPL significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of generalization.

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the asymptotic analysis of a sequence of\nvariational models of brittle damage in the context of linearized elasticity in\nthe two-dimensional discrete setting. We consider a discrete version of\nFrancfort and Marigo's brittle damage model, where the total energy is\nrestricted to continuous and piecewise affine displacements; within different\nregimes where the damaged regions concentrate on vanishingly small sets while\nthe stiffness of the damaged material degenerates to $0$. In this setting, the\nconvergence of the space discretization, the concentration of the damaged\nregions, and the decay of the elastic properties of the damaged phase all\ncompete simultaneously in non-trivial ways according to the scaling law under\nconsideration. The mesh size turns out to be a crucial feature of the analysis,\nas it induces a minimal scale of spatial oscillations for admissible\ndisplacements. This study was motivated by the numerical investigations\nperformed in [2] on the one hand, where Allaire-Jouve-Van Goethem have shown\nthat forcing the stiffness decay on sets of arbitrarily small measure seems to\nlead to concentrations phenomena such as in brittle fracture; and by the static\nanalysis performed in [10] on the other hand, where Babadjian-Iurlano-Rindler\naddressed the rigorous asymptotic analysis of this observation in terms of the\n$\\Gamma$-convergence of the total energies, in the continuous setting in space.\nSurprisingly, they showed that fracture-type models were not obtained\nasymptotically, thus raising the question of the dependence of the effective\nmodels with respect to the scaling of a spatial discretization in Francfort and\nMarigo's model. This is the content of the present work, where we show that\nconcentrations phenomena are only captured asymptotically in regimes where the\nmesh size and the concentration of damaged regions are of same order.",

We apply this approach to\ndemonstrate that CoTi alloys offer a superior solution as an MRL compared to\nthe commonly used Fe or Ni-based MRLs. The low nuclear and magnetic scattering\nlength densities of CoTi significantly enhance sensitivity, making it\nparticularly advantageous for soft matter research. Furthermore, the tunable Co\nvs Ti ratio allows for optimization of the SLDs to achieve maximum sensitivity,\nestablishing CoTi as a highly effective choice for MRL applications. The\napplied simulation framework for optimizing MRL sensitivity to a specific\nmaterials system and research question is a generic approach that can be used\nprior to growing the MRL for a given experiment.",

The amount of stellar\nradiation converted into heat depends on the energy of the primary electrons\nproduced by photoionisation and the local ionisation fraction. The Lyman-alpha\nline is an excellent probe for atmospheric escape. We study the interaction\nbetween the planetary and the stellar wind, the difference of the predicted\nmass-loss rates between 1D and 2D models, the signal of Ly-a and the impact of\nstellar flares. Using the PLUTO code, we perform 2D hydrodynamics simulations\nfor four different planets. We consider planets in the size range from Neptune\nto Jupiter. We produce synthetic Ly-a profiles to comprehend the origin of the\nsignal, and in particular its high velocity Doppler shift. Our results indicate\na trend similar to the 1D models, with a decrease in the planetary mass-loss\nrate for all systems when secondary ionisation is taken into account. The\nmass-loss rates are found to decrease by 48% for the least massive planet when\nsecondary ionisation is accounted for. We find nevertheless a decrease that is\nless pronounced in 2D than in 1D. We observe differences in the Ly-a profile\nbetween the different cases and significant asymmetries in all of them,\nespecially for the lower mass planets. Finally, we observe that stellar flares\ndo not affect the mass-loss rate because they act, in general, on a timescale\nthat is too short. We find velocities in the escaping atmosphere up to 100\nkm/s, with the gas moving away from the star, which could be the result of the\ninteraction with the stellar wind. Furthermore, we find that stellar flares\ngenerally occur on a timescale that is too short to have a visible impact on\nthe mass-loss rate of the atmosphere.",

However, these End-to-End\nGenerative Recommendation (E2E-GR) methods tend to prioritize idealized goals,\noften at the expense of the practical advantages offered by traditional Deep\nLearning based Recommendation Models (DLRMs) in terms of in features,\narchitecture, and practices.

In this paper, we introduce a large user\nmodel (LUM) that addresses these limitations through a three-step paradigm,\ndesigned to meet the stringent requirements of industrial settings while\nunlocking the potential for scalable recommendations. Our extensive\nexperimental evaluations demonstrate that LUM outperforms both state-of-the-art\nDLRMs and E2E-GR approaches.

A conclusive methodology capable of\naccounting both for (continuous) time and parameter dependency in such DL\nmodels however is still lacking. In this paper, we propose an autoregressive\nand data-driven method using the analogy with classical numerical solvers for\ntime-dependent, parametric and (typically) nonlinear PDEs. We present how\nDimensionality Reduction (DR) can be coupled with Neural Ordinary Differential\nEquations (NODEs) in order to learn the solution operator of arbitrary PDEs.\nThe idea of our work is that it is possible to map the high-fidelity (i.e.,\nhigh-dimensional) PDE solution space into a reduced (low-dimensional) space,\nwhich subsequently exhibits dynamics governed by a (latent) Ordinary\nDifferential Equation (ODE). Solving this (easier) ODE in the reduced space\nallows avoiding solving the PDE in the high-dimensional solution space, thus\ndecreasing the computational burden for repeated calculations for e.g.,\nuncertainty quantification or design optimization purposes. The main outcome of\nthis work is the importance of exploiting DR as opposed to the recent trend of\nbuilding large and complex architectures: we show that by leveraging DR we can\ndeliver not only more accurate predictions, but also a considerably lighter and\nfaster DL model compared to existing methodologies.",

We leverage the\nin-context learning ability of LLMs to perform self-repair in the coding\ndomain. The key contribution of our paper is an approach that synthesises and\nselects an ordered set of golden example pairs, or AuPairs, of these initial\nguesses and subsequent fixes for the corresponding problems. Each such AuPair\nis provided as a single in-context example at inference time to generate a\nrepaired solution. For an inference-time compute budget of $N$ LLM calls per\nproblem, $N$ AuPairs are used to generate $N$ repaired solutions, out of which\nthe highest-scoring solution is selected as the final answer. The underlying\nintuition is that if the LLM is given a different example of fixing an\nincorrect guess each time, it can subsequently generate a diverse set of\nrepaired solutions. Our algorithm selects these AuPairs in a manner that\nmaximises complementarity and usefulness. We demonstrate the results of our\nalgorithm on 5 LLMs across 7 competitive programming datasets for the code\nrepair task. Our algorithm yields a significant boost in performance compared\nto best-of-$N$ and self-repair, and also exhibits strong generalisation across\ndatasets and models.

    "abstract": "Generative models have gained significant attention in multivariate time\nseries forecasting (MTS), particularly due to their ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity samples. Forecasting the probability distribution of multivariate\ntime series is a challenging yet practical task. Although some recent attempts\nhave been made to handle this task, two major challenges persist: 1) some\nexisting generative methods underperform in high-dimensional multivariate time\nseries forecasting, which is hard to scale to higher dimensions; 2) the\ninherent high-dimensional multivariate attributes constrain the forecasting\nlengths of existing generative models. In this paper, we point out that\ndiscrete token representations can model high-dimensional MTS with faster\ninference time, and forecasting the target with long-term trends of itself can\nextend the forecasting length with high accuracy. Motivated by this, we propose\na vector quantized framework called Hierarchical Discrete Transformer (HDT)\nthat models time series into discrete token representations with l2\nnormalization enhanced vector quantized strategy, in which we transform the MTS\nforecasting into discrete tokens generation. To address the limitations of\ngenerative models in long-term forecasting, we propose a hierarchical discrete\nTransformer. This model captures the discrete long-term trend of the target at\nthe low level and leverages this trend as a condition to generate the discrete\nrepresentation of the target at the high level that introduces the features of\nthe target itself to extend the forecasting length in high-dimensional MTS.\nExtensive experiments on five popular MTS datasets verify the effectiveness of\nour proposed method.",

Additionally,\nresearch on AI alignment has made significant advancements in training models\nto refuse generating misleading or toxic content. As a result, LLMs generally\nbecame honest and harmless. In this study, we introduce \"deception attacks\"\nthat undermine both of these traits, revealing a vulnerability that, if\nexploited, could have serious real-world consequences. We introduce fine-tuning\nmethods that cause models to selectively deceive users on targeted topics while\nremaining accurate on others. Through a series of experiments, we show that\nsuch targeted deception is effective even in high-stakes domains or\nideologically charged subjects. In addition, we find that deceptive fine-tuning\noften compromises other safety properties: deceptive models are more likely to\nproduce toxic content, including hate speech and stereotypes. Finally, we\nassess whether models can deceive consistently in multi-turn dialogues,\nyielding mixed results. Given that millions of users interact with LLM-based\nchatbots, voice assistants, agents, and other interfaces where trustworthiness\ncannot be ensured, securing these models against deception attacks is critical.",

The second technology involves learning physics\nsimulations with non-parameterized geometrical variability using classical\nmachine learning tools, such as Gaussian process regression. Finally, we\npresent our contributions to the open-source and open-data community.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has enabled remarkable progress in binary code analysis. In\nparticular, pre-trained embeddings of assembly code have become a gold standard\nfor solving analysis tasks, such as measuring code similarity or recognizing\nfunctions. These embeddings are capable of learning a vector representation\nfrom unlabeled code. In contrast to natural language processing, however, label\ninformation is not scarce for many tasks in binary code analysis. For example,\nlabeled training data for function boundaries, optimization levels, and\nargument types can be easily derived from debug information provided by a\ncompiler. Consequently, the main motivation of embeddings does not transfer\ndirectly to binary code analysis.\n  In this paper, we explore the role of pre-trained embeddings from a critical\nperspective. To this end, we systematically evaluate recent embeddings for\nassembly code on five downstream tasks using a corpus of 1.2 million functions\nfrom the Debian distribution. We observe that several embeddings perform\nsimilarly when sufficient labeled data is available, and that differences\nreported in prior work are hardly noticeable. Surprisingly, we find that\nend-to-end learning without pre-training performs best on average, which calls\ninto question the need for specialized embeddings. By varying the amount of\nlabeled data, we eventually derive guidelines for when embeddings offer\nadvantages and when end-to-end learning is preferable for binary code analysis.",

We use thin-film theory to derive an evolution equation\nfor the layer thickness, which we solve numerically to examine the nonlinear\ndynamics. Instability and collar formation occur when gravity is sufficiently\nstrong to make the fluid yield initially.

The structure of the asymptotic solution for a\nviscoplastic collar shares some features with the Newtonian version, but there\nare several novel asymptotic regions that emerge at the two ends of the collar.\nThe global force balance, which determines the collar's speed, is modified by a\nleading-order contribution from viscous drag in the collar when the liquid is\nviscoplastic. We use the asymptotic model to describe slow changes in collar\nvolume when the film thicknesses ahead of, and behind, the collar are unequal.\nWhen the film thickness ahead of the collar is less than a critical value that\nwe determine, viscoplastic collars adjust their volume and reach a\nsteadily-translating state.

The speed of solar wind from the\nopen-field corridor also shows no correlation with the magnetic field expansion\nfactor, unlike the coronal hole.

    "abstract": "Fast-moving accretors are ubiquitous in astrophysics. Their interaction with\nsurrounding gas leaves characteristic imprints, forming structures like bow\nshocks, Mach cones, and density trails. We study how various physical processes\naffect the flow structure around an accretor with a one-way surface, its\naccretion rate, and accretion anisotropy. These processes correspond to\ndistinct length scales: the Bondi radius, the bow shock's stand-off distance,\nand the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius. We conducted adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations\nusing a spherical coordinate grid centred on the accretor. By varying the\naccretor's (numerical) size across scales -- from much smaller than the\nstand-off distance to much larger than the Bondi radius -- we analyse how these\nspatial scales affect steady-state flow physics. All simulations reach a steady\nstate. When the accretor is smaller than the stand-off distance, a bow shock\nforms ahead, and a nearly spherically symmetric atmosphere develops within.\nAccretors smaller than the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius produce a Mach cone, while\nlarger ones exhibit a supersonic-to-subsonic flow transition on larger scales.\nFully resolved simulations align with Hoyle-Lyttleton theory, showing slightly\nanisotropic accretion with enhanced inflow from behind. In contrast, larger\naccretors approach the geometrical limit, accreting mainly from the flow\ndirection, with a low-density 'shadow' forming behind. The accretor's size\nstrongly influences small- and large-scale morphologies. Resolving the\nHoyle-Lyttleton radius is essential for capturing large-scale flow\ncharacteristics. Resolving the stand-off distance is needed only to study the\nbow shock: since it determines the shock's position, its non-resolution does\nnot affect large-scale flow morphology.",

Although image segmentation has\nrecently been introduced to distinguish particles at the pixel level, the low\nSNR complicates the automated generation of accurate annotations for training\nsupervised models. Moreover, platforms for systematically comparing different\ndesign choices in pipeline construction are lacking. Thus, a modular framework\nis essential to understand the advantages and limitations of this approach and\ndrive further development. To address these challenges, we present a pipeline\nthat automatically generates high-quality segmentation maps from cryo-EM data\nto serve as ground truth labels. Our modular framework enables the selection of\nvarious segmentation models and loss functions. We also integrate Conditional\nRandom Fields (CRFs) with different solvers and feature sets to refine coarse\npredictions, thereby producing fine-grained segmentation. This flexibility\nfacilitates optimal configurations tailored to cryo-EM datasets. When trained\non a limited set of micrographs, our approach achieves over 90% accuracy,\nrecall, precision, Intersection over Union (IoU), and F1-score on synthetic\ndata. Furthermore, to demonstrate our framework's efficacy in downstream\nanalyses, we show that the particles extracted by our pipeline produce 3D\ndensity maps with higher resolution than those generated by existing particle\npickers on real experimental datasets, while achieving performance comparable\nto that of manually curated datasets from experts.",

The results include characterizations of both the spatial\ndistribution and frequency distribution of the stillness movement observed.\n  Also included are results indicating a possible role for constant forces and\nviscosities in reducing stillness movement amplitude, thereby potentially\nenabling the implementation of more positional control of musical sound within\nthe same available spatial range.\n  Importantly, the above is summarized in a form that is directly interpretable\nfor anyone designing technologies, interactions, or performances that involve\nfingertip control of musical sound.\n  Also, a complete data set of the experimental results is included in the\nseparate Appendices to this paper, again in a format that is directly\ninterpretable.",

Its goal is to provide seamless ride-hailing services and beyond\nthrough a natural and efficient conversational interface under dynamic and\ncomplex spatiotemporal urban contexts. To achieve this, we propose a\nspatiotemporal-aware order planning module that leverages external tools for\nprecise spatiotemporal reasoning and progressive order planning. Additionally,\nwe develop a cost-effective dialogue system that integrates multi-type dialog\nrepliers with cost-aware LLM configurations to handle diverse conversation\ngoals and trade-off response quality and latency. Furthermore, we introduce a\ncontinual fine-tuning scheme that utilizes real-world interactions and\nsimulated dialogues to align the assistant's behavior with human preferred\ndecision-making processes. Since its deployment in the DiDi application, DiMA\nhas demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 93% accuracy in order\nplanning and 92% in response generation during real-world interactions. Offline\nexperiments further validate DiMA capabilities, showing improvements of up to\n70.23% in order planning and 321.27% in response generation compared to three\nstate-of-the-art agent frameworks, while reducing latency by $0.72\\times$ to\n$5.47\\times$.

To alleviate SSB, previous\nwisdom proposes to design novel auxiliary tasks to enable the CVR learning on\nun-click training samples, such as CTCVR and counterfactual CVR, etc. Although\nalleviating SSB to some extent, none of them pay attention to the\ndiscrimination between ambiguous negative samples (un-clicked) and factual\nnegative samples (clicked but un-converted) during modelling, which makes CVR\nmodel lacks robustness.

These\ninteractions have been modeled using traditional graphs, where the\nrelationships between agents are always pairwise. In comparison, higher-order\nnetworks (such as hypergraphs), offer the possibility to capture more complex,\ngroup-wise interactions among agents. This raises a natural question: can\ncollective behavior be analyzed by using hypergraphs? The answer is\naffirmative. In this paper, higher-order Laplacian dynamics on signless\nhypergraphs are first introduced and various collective convergence behaviors\nare investigated, in the framework of homogeneous and non-homogeneous\npolynomial systems. Furthermore, by employing gauge transformations and\nleveraging tensor similarities, we extend these dynamics to signed hypergraphs,\ndrawing parallels to the Altafini model. Moreover, we explore non-polynomial\ninteraction functions within this framework. The theoretical results are\ndemonstrated through several numerical examples.",

To capitalize on the potential of using LLMs as recommender systems,\nmainstream approaches typically focus on two paradigms. The first paradigm\ndesigns multi-domain or multi-task instruction data for generalizable\nrecommendation, so as to align LLMs with general recommendation areas and deal\nwith cold-start recommendation. The second paradigm enhances domain-specific\nrecommendation tasks with parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, in order\nto improve models under the warm recommendation scenarios. While most previous\nworks treat these two paradigms separately, we argue that they have\ncomplementary advantages, and combining them together would be helpful.\n  To that end, in this paper, we propose a generalizable and efficient\nLLM-based recommendation framework MoLoRec. Our approach starts by\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning a domain-general module with general\nrecommendation instruction data, to align LLM with recommendation knowledge.\nThen, given users' behavior of a specific domain, we construct a\ndomain-specific instruction dataset and apply efficient fine-tuning to the\npre-trained LLM. After that, we provide approaches to integrate the above\ndomain-general part and domain-specific part with parameters mixture. Please\nnote that, MoLoRec is efficient with plug and play, as the domain-general\nmodule is trained only once, and any domain-specific plug-in can be efficiently\nmerged with only domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on multiple\ndatasets under both warm and cold-start recommendation scenarios validate the\neffectiveness and generality of the proposed MoLoRec.",

However, previous studies\noften rely on various approximations that may introduce uncertainties in the\nresults.

We numerically solve four\nself-consistent Eliashberg integral equations of the mass renormalization\n$A_{1}(p)$, the chemical potential renormalization $A_{2}(p)$, the pairing\nfunction $\\Phi(p)$, and the nematic self-energy (polarization) function\n$\\Pi(q)$ using the iteration method. Our calculations retain the explicit\nnon-linearity and the full momentum dependence of these equations. We find that\ndiscarding some commonly used approximations allows for a more accurate\ndetermination of the superconducting gap $\\Delta = \\Phi/A_{1}$ and the critical\ntemperature $T_{c}$. The Eliashberg equations have two different convergent gap\nsolutions: an extended $s$-wave gap and a $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave gap.

The existing injection mechanisms have significant limitations - most of\nthem rely on ad hoc, hand-crafted strategies which fail to capture the natural\ndiversity of anomalous patterns, or are restricted to univariate time series\nsettings. To address these challenges, we design a generative model for TSAD\nusing a variational autoencoder, which is referred to as a Generator for\nInstantiating Anomalies in Time Series (GenIAS). GenIAS is designed to produce\ndiverse and realistic synthetic anomalies for TSAD tasks. By employing a novel\nlearned perturbation mechanism in the latent space and injecting the perturbed\npatterns in different segments of time series, GenIAS can generate anomalies\nwith greater diversity and varying scales. Further, guided by a new triplet\nloss function, which uses a min-max margin and a new variance-scaling approach\nto further enforce the learning of compact normal patterns, GenIAS ensures that\nanomalies are distinct from normal samples while remaining realistic. The\napproach is effective for both univariate and multivariate time series. We\ndemonstrate the diversity and realism of the generated anomalies. Our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that GenIAS - when integrated into a TSAD task -\nconsistently outperforms seventeen traditional and deep anomaly detection\nmodels, thereby highlighting the potential of generative models for time series\nanomaly generation.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are advancing rapidly, with Level-4 AVs already\noperating in real-world conditions. Current AVs, however, still lag behind\nhuman drivers in adaptability and performance, often exhibiting overly\nconservative behaviours and occasionally violating traffic laws. Existing\nsolutions, such as runtime enforcement, mitigate this by automatically\nrepairing the AV's planned trajectory at runtime, but such approaches lack\ntransparency and should be a measure of last resort. It would be preferable for\nAV repairs to generalise beyond specific incidents and to be interpretable for\nusers. In this work, we propose FixDrive, a framework that analyses driving\nrecords from near-misses or law violations to generate AV driving strategy\nrepairs that reduce the chance of such incidents occurring again. These repairs\nare captured in {\\mu}Drive, a high-level domain-specific language for\nspecifying driving behaviours in response to event-based triggers. Implemented\nfor the state-of-the-art autonomous driving system Apollo, FixDrive identifies\nand visualises critical moments from driving records, then uses a Multimodal\nLarge Language Model (MLLM) with zero-shot learning to generate {\\mu}Drive\nprograms. We tested FixDrive on various benchmark scenarios, and found that the\ngenerated repairs improved the AV's performance with respect to following\ntraffic laws, avoiding collisions, and successfully reaching destinations.\nFurthermore, the direct costs of repairing an AV -- 15 minutes of offline\nanalysis and $0.08 per violation -- are reasonable in practice.",

In offline-to-online learning, a\nlearner starts with offline data collected from interactions with an unknown\nenvironment in a way that is not under the learner's control. Given this data,\nthe learner begins interacting with the environment, gradually improving its\ninitial strategy as it collects more data to maximize its total reward. The\nlearner in this setting faces a fundamental dilemma: if the policy is deployed\nfor only a short period, a suitable strategy (in a number of senses) is the\nLower Confidence Bound (LCB) algorithm, which is based on pessimism. LCB can\neffectively compete with any policy that is sufficiently \"covered\" by the\noffline data. However, for longer time horizons, a preferred strategy is the\nUpper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, which is based on optimism. Over time,\nUCB converges to the performance of the optimal policy at a rate that is nearly\nthe best possible among all online algorithms. In offline-to-online learning,\nhowever, UCB initially explores excessively, leading to worse short-term\nperformance compared to LCB. This suggests that a learner not in control of how\nlong its policy will be in use should start with LCB for short horizons and\ngradually transition to a UCB-like strategy as more rounds are played. This\narticle explores how and why this transition should occur. Our main result\nshows that our new algorithm performs nearly as well as the better of LCB and\nUCB at any point in time. The core idea behind our algorithm is broadly\napplicable, and we anticipate that our results will extend beyond the\nmulti-armed bandit setting.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is often evaluated\nusing benchmarks with limited numerical ranges, failing to reflect real-world\nproblem-solving across diverse scales. Furthermore, most existing evaluation\nmethods only compare model outputs to ground-truth answers, obscuring insights\ninto reasoning processes. To address these limitations, we introduce\nGSM-Ranges, a dataset generator derived from GSM8K that systematically perturbs\nnumerical values in math problems to assess model robustness across varying\nnumerical scales. Additionally, we propose a novel grading methodology that\ndistinguishes between logical and non-logical errors, offering a more precise\nevaluation of reasoning processes beyond computational accuracy. Our\nexperiments with various models reveal a significant increase in logical error\nrates-up to 14 percentage points-as numerical complexity rises, demonstrating a\ngeneral weakness in reasoning with out-of-distribution numerical values.\nMoreover, while models demonstrate high accuracy on standalone arithmetic\ntasks, their performance deteriorates substantially when computations are\nembedded within word problems. These findings provide a comprehensive\nevaluation of LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities and inform future\nresearch directions for improving numerical generalization in language models.",

We aim to address these limitations with UniCoRN, a Unified Commented\nRetrieval Network that combines the strengths of composed multimodal retrieval\nmethods and generative language approaches, going beyond Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG). We introduce an entity adapter module to inject the retrieved\nmultimodal entities back into the LMM, so it can attend to them while\ngenerating answers and comments. By keeping the base LMM frozen, UniCoRN\npreserves its original capabilities while being able to perform both retrieval\nand text generation tasks under a single integrated framework. To assess these\nnew abilities, we introduce the Commented Retrieval task (CoR) and a\ncorresponding dataset, with the goal of retrieving an image that accurately\nanswers a given question and generate an additional textual response that\nprovides further clarification and details about the visual information.

To develop and validate\nSmart-CCS, we first curated a large-scale, multi-center dataset named CCS-127K,\nwhich comprises a total of 127,471 cervical cytology whole-slide images\ncollected from 48 medical centers.

The\nrotation of the top annular plate generates a main flow in the azimuthal\ndirection, while generating a secondary recirculation flow in the plane of the\nchannel cross-section, due to the presence of a centrifugal force difference.\nAs a result, the vertical profile of the azimuthal velocity deviates from the\nclassical linear profile of the SPC flow, adopting an unexpected S-shape,\nsimilar to that observed in a turbulent plane Couette flow. Depending on the\nvalues of $A_c$ and $C_r$, the flow exhibits a wide range of behaviors, from a\nquasi-2D flow with a homogeneous shear rate at moderate ${\\rm Re}$ with\nappropriate geometrical parameters ($A_c \\gtrsim 5$, $C_r \\lesssim 0.1$), to a\ncomplex 3D flow otherwise. Whereas it is laminar, the APC flow shares a strong\nanalogy with a turbulent Taylor Couette (TC) flow. At large Reynolds numbers,\nthe velocity gradients concentrate near the wall and the flow reaches an\nasymptotic regime where the torque scales as ${\\rm Re}^\\alpha$ and the flow\nstructure becomes independent of ${\\rm Re}$. Such properties make the APC flow\nan interesting configuration for fundamental investigations as a complement of\nthe TC flow when shear and gravity are required to be in the same plane. In\nparticular, it can be used to investigate the rheology of a dispersed two-phase\nmixture similarly to the work done by Yi et al. \\cite{YI2021,Yi2022} in the TC\ndevice.",

A\nseparate fit has also been performed employing a physical reflection model. We\nalso perform time-resolved spectral analysis of a type-I burst employing a\nblackbody model. We observe a broadened iron emission line, thus suggesting\nrelativistic effects, supported by the physical model accounting for\nrelativistically blurred reflection. The resulting accretion disk extends down\nto 6 gravitational radii, inclined at ~$53^{\\circ}$, and only moderately\nionized (log$\\xi\\simeq2.3$).

However,\nexisting phase-coherent imaging approaches are not suited to imaging multiple\nmoving targets, since the Doppler effect causes a phase rotation that degrades\nthe image focus and biases the targets' locations. In this paper, we propose\nMovISAC, the first coherent imaging method for moving targets using distributed\nasynchronous ISAC devices. Our approach obtains a set of high-resolution images\nof the environment, in which each image represents only targets moving with a\nselected velocity. To achieve this, MovISAC performs over-the-air (OTA)\nsynchronization to compensate for timing, frequency, and phase offsets among\ndistributed ISAC devices. Then, to solve the prohibitive complexity of an\nexhaustive search over the targets' velocities, we introduce a new association\nalgorithm to match the Doppler shifts observed by each ISAC device pair to the\ncorresponding spatial peaks obtained by standard imaging methods. This gives\nMovISAC the unique capability of pre-compensating the Doppler shift for each\ntarget before forming the images, thus recasting it from an undesired\nimpairment to image formation to an additional means for resolving the targets.\nWe perform extensive numerical simulations showing that our approach achieves\nextremely high resolution, superior robustness to clutter thanks to the\nadditional target separation in the Doppler domain, and obtains cm- and\ncm/s-level target localization and velocity estimation errors. MovISAC\nsignificantly outperforms existing imaging methods that do not compensate for\nthe Doppler shift, demonstrating up to 18 times lower localization error and\nenabling velocity estimation.",

The\ngeneration of skills is a challenging endeavor, but its successful\nimplementation could greatly facilitate human skill learning and provide more\nexperience for embodied intelligence. Although current video generation models\ncan synthesis simple and atomic human operations, they struggle with human\nskills due to their complex procedure process. Human skills involve multi-step,\nlong-duration actions and complex scene transitions, so the existing naive\nauto-regressive methods for synthesizing long videos cannot generate human\nskills. To address this, we propose a novel task, the Key-step Skill Generation\n(KS-Gen), aimed at reducing the complexity of generating human skill videos.\nGiven the initial state and a skill description, the task is to generate video\nclips of key steps to complete the skill, rather than a full-length video. To\nsupport this task, we introduce a carefully curated dataset and define multiple\nevaluation metrics to assess performance. Considering the complexity of KS-Gen,\nwe propose a new framework for this task. First, a multimodal large language\nmodel (MLLM) generates descriptions for key steps using retrieval argument.\nSubsequently, we use a Key-step Image Generator (KIG) to address the\ndiscontinuity between key steps in skill videos.

While previous work has aerothermally\ndemonstrated the potential to decarbonize the heat input to the reaction,\noptimizing the reaction efficiency has been a challenge. This is because\nmeasuring reaction performance with aerochemical simulations is computationally\nprohibitive due to the uniquely complex aerodynamics and chemistry within\nturbomachines. To address this, we introduce a new multifidelity\nmachine-learning-assisted methodology, called ChemZIP, to mitigate this\nbottleneck. Although data-driven methodologies exist for combustion, modeling\nreactive flows along the bladed path of a turbomachine poses new challenges.\nThis has led to a novel training data generation process, which allows rich\ndynamic responses of the chemical system to be embedded into the training\ndataset at a fraction of the cost of reacting flow simulations. The resulting\nhigh-dimensional composition vector is compressed into a low-dimensional basis\nusing an autoencoder-like neural network, inspired by but more universal than\ntraditional flamelet-generated manifolds. Verification against 10,000 unseen\none-dimensional test conditions shows an R2 score exceeding 95% across all\nquantities of interest. Following this, ChemZIP is coupled into a fully-fledged\nviscous computational fluid dynamics solver. For a set of process-relevant\nthree-dimensional configurations entirely different from the training data, the\npredictive accuracy of the thermochemical state remains within 10% of an\nindustry-standard solver while convergence is achieved 50 times faster, even\nfor a small mechanism.

This motivates the usage of prices of the former fare\nstructure or other desirable prices as reference prices. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the fare structure design problem that aims to determine fares such\nthat the sum of absolute deviations between the new fares and the reference\nprices is minimized. Fare strategies that are considered here are flat tariffs,\naffine distance tariffs and zone tariffs. Additionally, we regard constraints\nthat ensure that it is not beneficial to buy a ticket for a longer journey than\nactually traveled (no-elongation property) or to split a ticket into several\nsub-tickets to cover a journey (no-stopover property). Our literature review\nprovides an overview of the research on fare planning. We analyze the fare\nstructure design problem for flat, distance and zone tariffs, pointing out\nconnections to median problems. Further, we study its complexity which ranges\nfrom linear-time solvability to NP-complete cases.",

In this paper, we demonstrate that mislabeled\nexamples correctly predicted by the model early in the training process are\nparticularly harmful to model performance.

To address this, we propose Early Cutting,\nwhich introduces a recalibration step that employs the model's later training\nstate to re-select the confident subset identified early in training, thereby\navoiding misleading confidence from early learning and effectively filtering\nout MEEs.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled the\ndevelopment of LVLM-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents under various\nparadigms. Training-based approaches, such as CogAgent and SeeClick, struggle\nwith cross-dataset and cross-platform generalization due to their reliance on\ndataset-specific training. Generalist LVLMs, such as GPT-4V, employ\nSet-of-Marks (SoM) for action grounding, but obtaining SoM labels requires\nmetadata like HTML source, which is not consistently available across\nplatforms. Moreover, existing methods often specialize in singular GUI tasks\nrather than achieving comprehensive GUI understanding. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce TRISHUL, a novel, training-free agentic framework\nthat enhances generalist LVLMs for holistic GUI comprehension. Unlike prior\nworks that focus on either action grounding (mapping instructions to GUI\nelements) or GUI referring (describing GUI elements given a location), TRISHUL\nseamlessly integrates both. At its core, TRISHUL employs Hierarchical Screen\nParsing (HSP) and the Spatially Enhanced Element Description (SEED) module,\nwhich work synergistically to provide multi-granular, spatially, and\nsemantically enriched representations of GUI elements. Our results demonstrate\nTRISHUL's superior performance in action grounding across the ScreenSpot,\nVisualWebBench, AITW, and Mind2Web datasets.

    "abstract": "In the realm of microservices architecture, the occurrence of frequent\nincidents necessitates the employment of Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for swift\nissue resolution. It is common that a serious incident can take several domain\nexperts hours to identify the root cause. Consequently, a contemporary trend\ninvolves harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated agents for RCA.\nThough the recent ReAct framework aligns well with the Site Reliability\nEngineers (SREs) for its thought-action-observation paradigm, its\nhallucinations often lead to irrelevant actions and directly affect subsequent\nresults. Additionally, the complex and variable clues of the incident can\noverwhelm the model one step further. To confront these challenges, we propose\nFlow-of-Action, a pioneering Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) enhanced\nLLM-based multi-agent system. By explicitly summarizing the diagnosis steps of\nSREs, SOP imposes constraints on LLMs at crucial junctures, guiding the RCA\nprocess towards the correct trajectory. To facilitate the rational and\neffective utilization of SOPs, we design an SOP-centric framework called SOP\nflow. SOP flow contains a series of tools, including one for finding relevant\nSOPs for incidents, another for automatically generating SOPs for incidents\nwithout relevant ones, and a tool for converting SOPs into code. This\nsignificantly alleviates the hallucination issues of ReAct in RCA tasks. We\nalso design multiple auxiliary agents to assist the main agent by removing\nuseless noise, narrowing the search space, and informing the main agent whether\nthe RCA procedure can stop. Compared to the ReAct method's 35.50% accuracy, our\nFlow-of-Action method achieves 64.01%, meeting the accuracy requirements for\nRCA in real-world systems.",

Here, we introduce\nbalanced constant-weight Gray codes for detecting consecutive positives\n(DCP-CWGCs) for the efficient construction of combinatorial pooling schemes.\nBalanced DCP-CWGCs ensure uniform item distribution across pools, allow for the\nidentification of consecutive positive items such as overlapping biological\nsequences, and enable error detection by keeping the number of tests on\nindividual and consecutive positive items constant. For the efficient\nconstruction of balanced DCP-CWGCs, we have released an open-source python\npackage codePub, with implementations of the two core algorithms: a\nbranch-and-bound algorithm (BBA) and a recursive combination with BBA (rcBBA).\nSimulations using codePub show that our algorithms can construct long, balanced\nDCP-CWGCs that allow for error detection in tractable runtime.",

    "abstract": "We consider a generalization of polynomial programs: algebraic programs,\nwhich are optimization or feasibility problems with algebraic objectives or\nconstraints. Algebraic functions are defined as zeros of multivariate\npolynomials. They are a rich set of functions that includes polynomials\nthemselves, but also ratios and radicals, and finite compositions thereof. When\nan algebraic program is given in terms of radical expressions, a\nstraightforward way of reformulating into a polynomial program is to introduce\na new variable for each distinct radical that appears. Hence, the rich theory\nand algorithms for polynomial programs, including satisfiability via\ncylindrical algebraic decomposition, infeasibility certificates via\nPositivstellensatz theorems, and optimization with sum-of-squares programming\ndirectly apply to algebraic programs. We propose a different reformulation,\nthat in many cases introduces significantly fewer new variables, and thus\nproduces polynomial programs that are easier to solve. First, we exhibit an\nalgorithm that finds a defining polynomial of an algebraic function given as a\nradical expression. As a polynomial does not in general define a unique\nalgebraic function, additional constraints need to be added that isolate the\nalgebraic function from others defined by the same polynomial. Using results\nfrom real algebraic geometry, we develop an algorithm that generates polynomial\ninequalities that isolate an algebraic function. This allows us to reformulate\nan algebraic program into a polynomial one, by introducing only a single new\nvariable for each algebraic function. On modified versions of classic\noptimization benchmarks with added algebraic terms, our formulation achieves\nspeedups of up to 50x compared to the straightforward reformulation.",

Algorithms like FedAsync and GeneralizedFedAsync\naddress this limitation by enabling asynchronous communication between clients\nand the central server. In this work, we rely on stochastic modeling and\nanalysis to better understand the impact of design choices in asynchronous FL\nalgorithms, such as the concurrency level and routing probabilities, and we\nleverage this knowledge to optimize loss. Compared to most existing studies, we\naccount for the joint impact of heterogeneous and variable service speeds and\nheterogeneous datasets at the clients. We characterize in particular a\nfundamental trade-off for optimizing asynchronous FL: minimizing gradient\nestimation errors by avoiding model parameter staleness, while also speeding up\nthe system by increasing the throughput of model updates. Our two main\ncontributions can be summarized as follows. First, we prove a discrete variant\nof Little's law to derive a closed-form expression for relative delay, a metric\nthat quantifies staleness. This allows us to efficiently minimize the average\nloss per model update, which has been the gold standard in literature to date.\nSecond, we observe that naively optimizing this metric leads us to slow down\nthe system drastically by overemphazing staleness at the detriment of\nthroughput. This motivates us to introduce an alternative metric that also\ntakes system speed into account, for which we derive a tractable upper-bound\nthat can be minimized numerically.

This\narticle investiagtes the creation of gravastar(gravitational vacuum star)\nwithin the realm of cylindrically symmetric space-time utilizing the Kuchowicz\nmetric potential. A stable gravastar comprises of three distinct regions,\nstarting with an interior region marked by positive energy density and negative\npressure $(p=-\\rho)$ which is followed by an intermediate thin shell, where the\ninterior negative pressure induces a outward repulsive force at each point on\nthe shell. Ultra-relativistic stiff fluid makes up the thin shell governed by\nthe equation of state(EoS) $(p=\\rho)$, which meets the Zel'dovich criteria. And\nthen comes the region exterior to it which is total vacuum. In this scenario,\nthe central singularity is eliminated and the event horizon is effectively\nsubstituted by the thin bounding shell. Employing the Kuchowicz metric\npotential we have derived the remaining metric functions for the interior\nregion and the shell regions yielding a non-singular solution for both the\nregions. Additionally, we have investigated various characteristics of this\nshell region including its proper shell length, the energy content and entropy.\nThis theoretical model successfully resolves the singularity issue inherent to\nthe black holes.

Also, the\nmap is equivariant under two actions of the fundamental group of the base\nmanifold: the holonomy action on the fiber and the action on the space of\nclosed subsets induced by the boundary sphere action.\n  Matsumoto established a dichotomy for these maps, which corresponds to a\ndichotomy of ergodic harmonic measures.

Although self-supervised learning has shown promise\nin medical image analysis, its application to classifying megakaryocytes in\nstained slides faces three main challenges: (1) pervasive background noise that\nobscures cellular details, (2) a long-tailed distribution that limits data for\nrare subtypes, and (3) complex morphological variations leading to high\nintra-class variability. To address these issues, we propose the ActiveSSF\nframework, which integrates active learning with self-supervised pretraining.\nSpecifically, our approach employs Gaussian filtering combined with K-means\nclustering and HSV analysis (augmented by clinical prior knowledge) for\naccurate region-of-interest extraction; an adaptive sample selection mechanism\nthat dynamically adjusts similarity thresholds to mitigate class imbalance; and\nprototype clustering on labeled samples to overcome morphological complexity.\nExperimental results on clinical megakaryocyte datasets demonstrate that\nActiveSSF not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also significantly\nimproves recognition accuracy for rare subtypes.

However,\nprevious works have primarily addressed this problem from a discrete-state\nperspective which is not suitable as the number of network layers grows. This\npaper novelly treats the outputs from layers as states of a continuous process\nand considers leveraging the state space model (SSM) to design the aggregation\nof layers in very deep neural networks.

From the perspective of amplitude analysis, it is argued\nthat all eight observables are necessary to completely determine the others. On\nthe other hand, proponents of partial-wave analysis, working with theoretically\nprecise data of infinite accuracy, claim that only four observables are needed.\nHowever, this claim is not acceptable from an experimental viewpoint, as all\ndata in the real world contain some uncertainty. This paper illustrates that\nthe controversy is artificial and is due to additional mathematical assumptions\nused in partial-wave analysis. Our research advances this discussion by moving\nfrom exact synthetic numerical data to also synthetic, but more realistic data\nin partial-wave analysis and shows that the claimed reduction in observables is\nunjustified. Consequently, the final conclusion is that the complete set of\nobservables in pseudo-scalar meson photoproduction, whether using amplitude\nanalysis or partial-wave analysis with practical data, must consist of eight\nobservables.",

As a result, such a solution will be shown to\nexist within this theory for a suitable setup of fields. Interestingly, the\nconsidered S\\'aez-Ballester theory can be shown to be equivalent to the\nstandard scalar-vector theory via a suitable field redefinition. This means\nthat the obtained solution can be reduced to that derived in an original\nanisotropic inflation model proposed by Kanno, Soda, and Watanabe.\nConsequently, the corresponding tensor-to-scalar ratio of this solution turns\nout to be higher than the latest observational value of the Planck satellite\n(Planck 2018) due to the fact that $c_s$, the corresponding speed of sound of\nscalar perturbations of the S\\'aez-Ballester theory, turns out to be one. This\nresult indicates an important hint that the speed of sound, $c_s$, could play\nan important role in making the corresponding non-canonical anisotropic\ninflation cosmologically viable in the light of the Planck 2018 data. To be\nmore specific, we will point out that any modifications of the S\\'aez-Ballester\ntheory having $c_s \\sim 0.1$ will have a great potential to be highly\nconsistent with the Planck 2018 data.

    "abstract": "Character video generation is a significant real-world application focused on\nproducing high-quality videos featuring specific characters. Recent\nadvancements have introduced various control signals to animate static\ncharacters, successfully enhancing control over the generation process.\nHowever, these methods often lack flexibility, limiting their applicability and\nmaking it challenging for users to synthesize a source character into a desired\ntarget scene. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, AnyCharV,\nthat flexibly generates character videos using arbitrary source characters and\ntarget scenes, guided by pose information. Our approach involves a two-stage\ntraining process. In the first stage, we develop a base model capable of\nintegrating the source character with the target scene using pose guidance. The\nsecond stage further bootstraps controllable generation through a self-boosting\nmechanism, where we use the generated video in the first stage and replace the\nfine mask with the coarse one, enabling training outcomes with better\npreservation of character details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthe superiority of our method compared with previous state-of-the-art methods.",

In this study, we investigate colloidal clusters\nformed through confined self-assembly. Small magic number clusters display\nicosahedral symmetry with closed surface shells, corresponding to pronounced\nfree energy minima. Our findings reveal that beyond a critical system size,\nclosed surface shells disappear, and free energy minima become less pronounced.\nInstead, we observe a distinct type of colloidal cluster, termed football\ncluster, which retains icosahedral symmetry but features lower-coordinated\nfacets disconnected by terraces.

To overcome this limitation, we\npropose sensors for daily life (SenDaL), the first framework that utilizes\nneural networks for calibrating low cost sensors. SenDaL introduces novel\ntraining and inference processes that enable it to achieve accuracy comparable\nto deep learning models while simultaneously preserving latency and energy\nconsumption similar to linear models. SenDaL is first trained in a bottom-up\nmanner, making decisions based on calibration results from both linear and deep\nlearning models. Once both models are trained, SenDaL makes independent\ndecisions through a top-down inference process, ensuring accuracy and inference\nspeed. Furthermore, SenDaL can select the optimal deep learning model according\nto the resources of the IoT devices because it is compatible with various deep\nlearning models, such as long short-term memory-based and Transformer-based\nmodels.

As one of the key prerequisites for the presence of the WSM state in\nWP2, spatial inversion symmetry breaking in this compound has rarely been\ninvestigated by experiments. Furthermore, how much anisotropy the electrical\nproperties of WP2 have and whether its electrical anisotropy can be tuned\nremain elusive. Here, we report angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy,\nelectrical transport, optical spectroscopy and first-principle studies of WP2.\nThe energies of the observed Raman-active phonons and the angle dependences of\nthe phonon intensities are well consistent with the results obtained by\nfirst-principle calculations and the analysis of the proposed crystal symmetry\nwithout spatial inversion, providing evidence that spatial inversion symmetry\nis broken in WP2. Moreover, the measured ratio (Rc/Ra) between the crystalline\nc-axis and a-axis electrical resistivities exhibits a weak dependence on\ntemperature from 100 to 250 K, but increases abruptly below 100 K, and then\nreaches the value of 8.0 at 10 K, which is by far the strongest in-plane\nelectrical resistivity anisotropy among the reported type-II WSM candidates\nwith comparable carrier concentrations. Our optical-spectroscopy and\ncalculation studies reveal that the abrupt enhancement of the Rc/Ra below 100 K\nmainly arises from a sharp increase in the scattering rate anisotropy at low\ntemperatures. More interestingly, the Rc/Ra at 10 K can be tuned from 8.0 to\n10.6 as the magnetic field increases from 0 to 9 T. The stronge and tunable\nelectrical resistivity anisotropy found in WP2 can serve as a degree of freedom\nfor tuning the electrical properties of type-II WSMs, which paves the way for\ndeveloping novel electronic applications based on type-II WSMs.",

However, the design of existing memory\noffloading mechanisms does not take latency service-level objectives (SLOs)\ninto consideration. As a result, they either lead to frequent SLO violations or\nunderutilize host memory, thereby incurring economic loss and thus defeating\nthe purpose of memory offloading.\n  This paper presents Select-N, a latency-SLO-aware memory offloading system\nfor LLM serving. A key challenge in designing Select-N is to reconcile the\ntension between meeting SLOs and maximizing host memory usage. Select-N\novercomes it by exploiting a unique characteristic of modern LLMs: during\nserving, the computation time of each decoder layer is deterministic.\nLeveraging this, Select-N introduces offloading interval, an internal tunable\nknob that captures the tradeoff between SLOs and host memory usage, thereby\nreducing the aforementioned challenge to pick an optimal offloading interval.\nWith that, Select-N proposes a two-stage approach to automatically pick the\noffloading interval. The first stage is offline that generates the range of\noptimal offloading interval, while the second stage adjusts offloading interval\nat the granularity of inference iteration based on runtime hardware status.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in educational,\nclinical, and professional settings, but their tendency for sycophancy --\nprioritizing user agreement over independent reasoning -- poses risks to\nreliability. This study introduces a framework to evaluate sycophantic behavior\nin ChatGPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro across AMPS (mathematics) and\nMedQuad (medical advice) datasets. Sycophantic behavior was observed in 58.19%\nof cases, with Gemini exhibiting the highest rate (62.47%) and ChatGPT the\nlowest (56.71%). Progressive sycophancy, leading to correct answers, occurred\nin 43.52% of cases, while regressive sycophancy, leading to incorrect answers,\nwas observed in 14.66%. Preemptive rebuttals demonstrated significantly higher\nsycophancy rates than in-context rebuttals (61.75% vs. 56.52%, $Z=5.87$,\n$p<0.001$), particularly in computational tasks, where regressive sycophancy\nincreased significantly (preemptive: 8.13%, in-context: 3.54%, $p<0.001$).\nSimple rebuttals maximized progressive sycophancy ($Z=6.59$, $p<0.001$), while\ncitation-based rebuttals exhibited the highest regressive rates ($Z=6.59$,\n$p<0.001$). Sycophantic behavior showed high persistence (78.5%, 95% CI:\n[77.2%, 79.8%]) regardless of context or model. These findings emphasize the\nrisks and opportunities of deploying LLMs in structured and dynamic domains,\noffering insights into prompt programming and model optimization for safer AI\napplications.",

The\nphenomenon is manifested as a shift of the ENDOR spectrum lines with respect to\nthe nitrogen Larmor frequency. It is hypothesized that these shifts are\nindicative of a substantial hyperfine interaction between the VB defect and the\n14N nuclei in hBN. A calculation utilizing second-order perturbation theory was\nexecuted to determine the positions of the ENDOR spectrum lines, resulting in\nthe formulation of correction equations.

Here we\npropose a new scheme to amplify a laser pulse with tunable wavelengths towards\nextremely high power via forward Raman amplification in plasma. Different from\nthose previously proposed schemes based upon backward Raman or Brillouin\namplification, our scheme involves a pump pulse and a seed pulse co-propagating\nin moderate density plasma, with the phase matching conditions for forward\nRaman scattering fulfilled. Due to their group velocity difference in plasma,\nthe pump with a shorter wavelength and longer duration will chase the seed and\ntransfer energy to the latter efficiently. Analytical models both for linear\nand nonlinear stages of amplification as well as particle-in-cell simulation\nshow that by employing a 1.0 $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ pump laser, a 1.8 $\\mathrm{\\mu\nm}$ seed pulse can be amplified $10^4$ times in its intensity, and then\nself-compressed to near-single-cycle. Our scheme shows the merits of high\nefficiency, high compactness, and relatively easy implementation with the\nco-propagating configuration, which may provide a unique route towards the\npetawatt few-cycle infrared laser pulses.",

Furthermore, the\nultra-high-energy data are then fit together with the IceCube measurements at\nlower energies, either with a single power law or with a broken power law,\nallowing for the presence of a new component in the spectrum. The joint fit\nincluding non-observations by other experiments in the ultra-high-energy region\nshows a slight preference for a break in the PeV regime if the ``High-Energy\nStarting Events'' sample is included, and no such preference for the other two\nIceCube samples investigated. A stronger preference for a break appears if only\nthe KM3NeT data is considered in the ultra-high-energy region, though the flux\nresulting from such a fit would be inconsistent with null observations from\nIceCube and Pierre Auger. In all cases, the observed tension between KM3NeT and\nother datasets is of the order of $2.5\\sigma-3\\sigma$, and increased statistics\nare required to resolve this apparent tension and better characterise the\nneutrino landscape at ultra-high energies.",

Our approach consists of two key phases:\nIntention Extraction and Intention Guided Revision Generation. Intention\nExtraction categorizes comments using predefined templates, while Intention\nGuided Revision Generation employs large language models (LLMs) to generate\nrevised code based on these defined intentions. Three categories with eight\nsubcategories are designed for comment transformation, which is followed by a\nhybrid approach that combines rule-based and LLM-based classifiers for accurate\nclassification. Extensive experiments with five LLMs (GPT4o, GPT3.5,\nDeepSeekV2, DeepSeek7B, CodeQwen7B) under different prompting settings\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves 79% accuracy in intention extraction and\nup to 66% in code refinement generation.

Although most books scored the same (3* on a 1* to 4* scale), the\ncitation rates correlate positively but weakly with ChatGPT 4o-mini research\nquality scores in both the social sciences and the arts and humanities.

    "abstract": "Collaborative perception, fusing information from multiple agents, can extend\nperception range so as to improve perception performance. However, temporal\nasynchrony in real-world environments, caused by communication delays, clock\nmisalignment, or sampling configuration differences, can lead to information\nmismatches. If this is not well handled, then the collaborative performance is\npatchy, and what's worse safety accidents may occur. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose CoDynTrust, an uncertainty-encoded asynchronous fusion perception\nframework that is robust to the information mismatches caused by temporal\nasynchrony. CoDynTrust generates dynamic feature trust modulus (DFTM) for each\nregion of interest by modeling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty as well as\nselectively suppressing or retaining single-vehicle features, thereby\nmitigating information mismatches. We then design a multi-scale fusion module\nto handle multi-scale feature maps processed by DFTM. Compared to existing\nworks that also consider asynchronous collaborative perception, CoDynTrust\ncombats various low-quality information in temporally asynchronous scenarios\nand allows uncertainty to be propagated to downstream tasks such as planning\nand control. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDynTrust significantly\nreduces performance degradation caused by temporal asynchrony across multiple\ndatasets, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance even with temporal\nasynchrony.

    "abstract": "This is the second part to our companion paper. The novel method to quantify\nartificial dissipation proposed in Part 1 is further applied in turbulent\nchannel flow at $\\mathrm{Re_\\tau}=180$ using various subgrid-scale models, with\nan emphasis on minimum-dissipation models (QR and AMD). We found that the\namount of artificial viscosity is comparable to the eddy viscosity, but their\ndistributions are essentially opposite. The artificial viscosity can either\nproduce turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) in the near wall region or dissipate TKE\nin the bulk region. The eddy viscosity is almost uniformly distributed across\nthe wall-normal direction and actively damps TKE at the channel center. An eddy\nviscosity level of $\\nu_e/\\nu < 22\\%$ leads to accurate predictions of flow\nquantities at the current mesh resolution. The optimal coefficients for the QR\nmodel combined with symmetry-preserving discretization were found to be C=0.092\nfor turbulent kinetic energy and C=0.012 for Reynolds stress terms and large\nscale motions. Adjusting the QR model coefficient changes the artificial\nviscosity and significantly impact turbulence characteristics: small-scale\nmotions remain unaffected, while larger scales are less accurately captured\nwith larger coefficients. For error quantification, the SGS activity parameter\n$\\nu_{rel} = \\frac{\\nu_e}{\\nu_e + \\nu}$ helps relate and reflect the error\nmagnitude with the SGS model. Optimal coefficients for the AMD model were also\nidentified. The trends of varying the coefficient are similar to the QR model\nbut differ in the amplitude of changes. The AMD model is more sensitive to the\nmodel coefficients and introduces more eddy viscosity in the near-wall region\ncompared to the QR model. This research highlights the importance of balancing\nnumerical and eddy viscosities for accurate LES predictions.",

We\nfind the time-reversal symmetry breaking via nonuniform coupling phases is\nartificial and thus cannot result in nonreciprocal single-photon scattering for\nthe giant atom. The nonreciprocity of the giant atom can be obtained by the\nexternal dissipation of the giant atom that truly breaks the time-reversal\nsymmetry. Our work clarifies the roles of symmetries in the chirality and\nnonreciprocity of giant-atom systems and paves the way for the design of\non-chip functional devices with superconducting giant atoms.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensing is of great benefits to our daily lives. However, wireless\nsignals are sensitive to the surroundings. Various factors, e.g. environments,\nlocations, and individuals, may induce extra impact on wireless propagation.\nSuch a change can be regarded as a domain, in which the data distribution\nshifts. A vast majority of the sensing schemes are learning-based. They are\ndependent on the training domains, resulting in performance degradation in\nunseen domains. Researchers have proposed various solutions to address this\nissue. But these solutions leverage either semi-supervised or unsupervised\ndomain adaptation techniques. They still require some data in the target\ndomains and do not perform well in unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a\ndomain generalization framework DGSense, to eliminate the domain dependence\nproblem in wireless sensing. The framework is a general solution working across\ndiverse sensing tasks and wireless technologies. Once the sensing model is\nbuilt, it can generalize to unseen domains without any data from the target\ndomain. To achieve the goal, we first increase the diversity of the training\nset by a virtual data generator, and then extract the domain independent\nfeatures via episodic training between the main feature extractor and the\ndomain feature extractors. The feature extractors employ a pre-trained Residual\nNetwork (ResNet) with an attention mechanism for spatial features, and a 1D\nConvolutional Neural Network (1DCNN) for temporal features. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness and generality of DGSense, we evaluated on WiFi gesture\nrecognition, Millimeter Wave (mmWave) activity recognition, and acoustic fall\ndetection. All the systems exhibited high generalization capability to unseen\ndomains, including new users, locations, and environments, free of new data and\nretraining.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel method to quantify artificial dissipation in large eddy\nsimulation. Here, artificial dissipation is defined as the residual of the\ndiscrete turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) equation. This method is applied to\nturbulent channel flow at Reynolds number 180 and 550 using a\nminimum-dissipation model within the OpenFOAM framework, employing both\nsymmetry-preserving and standard OpenFOAM discretizations. Our analysis reveals\nthat artificial viscosity can both produce and dissipate TKE. To quantify the\ninteraction between sub-grid-scale model contributions and numerical error, we\nintroduce viscous activity parameters, which also allow for evaluating the\nbalance between molecular and non-molecular viscosity. Examining temporal\ndiscretization schemes, we find that all methods can deliver accurate flow\npredictions if an appropriate time step is used. For very small time steps,\nForward-Euler is more efficient and accurate than Crank-Nicolson, though a\nbetter balance of accuracy and computational efficiency for larger time steps,\nmaking it preferable for large-scale applications. On collocated meshes, Van\nKan's pressure correction method predicts better results than Chorin's. Our\nspatial discretization study shows that the symmetry-preserving scheme\noutperforms standard OpenFOAM schemes, as excessive artificial errors from\nspatial discretization can suppress the LES model. For the symmetry-preserving\nscheme, both eddy and artificial viscosities vary similarly, with eddy\nviscosity being dominant. The role of artificial viscosity changes with mesh\nrefinement: on coarse meshes, it mainly dissipates TKE, while on finer meshes,\nit can produce TKE, counteracting eddy viscosity. The most accurate Reynolds\nshear stress predictions occur when non-molecular dissipation is nearly zero.\nFor accurate mean flow kinetic energy, larger non-molecular dissipation is\nneeded on finer meshes.",

Local differential privacy\n(LDP) is regarded as an effective defense against various attacks, including\nsample reconstruction in FL, where gradients are clipped and perturbed.\nExisting attacks are ineffective in FL with LDP since clipped and perturbed\ngradients obliterate most sample information for reconstruction. Besides,\nexisting attacks embed additional sample information into gradients to improve\nthe attack effect and cause gradient expansion, leading to a more severe\ngradient clipping in FL with LDP. In this paper, we propose a sample\nreconstruction attack against LDP-based FL with any target models to\nreconstruct victims' sensitive samples to illustrate that FL with LDP is not\nflawless. Considering gradient expansion in reconstruction attacks and noise in\nLDP, the core of the proposed attack is gradient compression and reconstructed\nsample denoising. For gradient compression, an inference structure based on\nsample characteristics is presented to reduce redundant gradients against LDP.\nFor reconstructed sample denoising, we artificially introduce zero gradients to\nobserve noise distribution and scale confidence interval to filter the noise.\nTheoretical proof guarantees the effectiveness of the proposed attack.\nEvaluations show that the proposed attack is the only attack that reconstructs\nvictims' training samples in LDP-based FL and has little impact on the target\nmodel's accuracy.

We\npropose a novel knowledge-guided Wasserstein Distributionally Robust\nOptimization (KG-WDRO) framework that adaptively incorporates multiple sources\nof external knowledge to overcome the conservativeness of vanilla WDRO, which\noften results in overly pessimistic shrinkage toward zero. Our method\nconstructs smaller Wasserstein ambiguity sets by controlling the transportation\nalong directions informed by the source knowledge. This strategy can alleviate\nperturbations on the predictive projection of the covariates and protect\nagainst information loss. Theoretically, we establish the equivalence between\nour WDRO formulation and the knowledge-guided shrinkage estimation based on\ncollinear similarity, ensuring tractability and geometrizing the feasible set.\nThis also reveals a novel and general interpretation for recent shrinkage-based\ntransfer learning approaches from the perspective of distributional robustness.\nIn addition, our framework can adjust for scaling differences in the regression\nmodels between the source and target and accommodates general types of\nregularization such as lasso and ridge.

To achieve efficient deuterium separation at\nroom temperature, we need materials with very tiny spaces, on an atomic scale.\nFor the first time, we've successfully created a material with spaces just\nabout 2.1 angstroms wide, which is similar in size to the wavelength of\nhydrogen isotopes at room temperature. This allows for efficient deuterium\nseparation, with a much higher D2/H2 selectivity of about 2.20, meaning the\nmaterial can separate deuterium from hydrogen much more effectively at room\ntemperature. The smaller deuterium molecules are more likely to pass through\nthese tiny spaces, showing that quantum effects play a key role in this\nprocess. In contrast, a material like graphene oxide, with larger spaces\n(around 4.0 angstroms) only shows a lower D2/H2 selectivity of approx 1.17,\nindicating weaker quantum effects. This discovery suggests that materials with\nvery small, atomic-scale spaces could be key to the efficient separation of\nhydrogen isotopes at room temperature.",

This approach overlooks the inherent structure\nof the covariance matrix, which is a complex Hermitian positive definite (HPD)\nmatrix residing in the Riemannian manifold. Vectorization disrupts the matrix\nstructure and misrepresents its geometric properties. To mitigate this\ndrawback, we propose HPDNet, a novel framework that directly processes HPD\nmatrices on the Riemannian manifold. The HPDnet fully considers the complex\nphase information by decomposing a complex HPD matrix into the real- and\nimaginarymatrices. The proposed HPDnet consists of several HPD mapping layers\nand rectifying layers, which can preserve the geometric structure of the data\nand transform them into a more separable manifold representation. Subsequently,\na complex LogEig layer is developed to project the manifold data into a tangent\nspace, ensuring that conventional Euclidean-based deep learning networks can be\napplied to further extract contextual features for classification. Furthermore,\nto optimize computational efficiency, we design a fast eigenvalue decomposition\nmethod for parallelized matrix processing.

    "abstract": "This paper presents ThinkDiff, a novel alignment paradigm that empowers\ntext-to-image diffusion models with multimodal in-context understanding and\nreasoning capabilities by integrating the strengths of vision-language models\n(VLMs). Existing multimodal diffusion finetuning methods largely focus on\npixel-level reconstruction rather than in-context reasoning, and are\nconstrained by the complexity and limited availability of reasoning-based\ndatasets. ThinkDiff addresses these challenges by leveraging vision-language\ntraining as a proxy task, aligning VLMs with the decoder of an encoder-decoder\nlarge language model (LLM) instead of a diffusion decoder. This proxy task\nbuilds on the observation that the $\\textbf{LLM decoder}$ shares the same input\nfeature space with $\\textbf{diffusion decoders}$ that use the corresponding\n$\\textbf{LLM encoder}$ for prompt embedding. As a result, aligning VLMs with\ndiffusion decoders can be simplified through alignment with the LLM decoder.\nWithout complex training and datasets, ThinkDiff effectively unleashes\nunderstanding, reasoning, and composing capabilities in diffusion models.\nExperiments demonstrate that ThinkDiff significantly improves accuracy from\n19.2% to 46.3% on the challenging CoBSAT benchmark for multimodal in-context\nreasoning generation, with only 5 hours of training on 4 A100 GPUs.\nAdditionally, ThinkDiff demonstrates exceptional performance in composing\nmultiple images and texts into logically coherent images.

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation is a key area in the field of recommendation\nsystems aiming to model user interest based on historical interaction sequences\nwith irregular intervals. While previous recurrent neural network-based and\nattention-based approaches have achieved significant results, they have\nlimitations in capturing system continuity due to the discrete characteristics.\nIn the context of continuous-time modeling, state space model (SSM) offers a\npotential solution, as it can effectively capture the dynamic evolution of user\ninterest over time. However, existing SSM-based approaches ignore the impact of\nirregular time intervals within historical user interactions, making it\ndifficult to model complexed user-item transitions in sequences. To address\nthis issue, we propose a hybrid SSM-based model called SS4Rec for\ncontinuous-time sequential recommendation. SS4Rec integrates a time-aware SSM\nto handle irregular time intervals and a relation-aware SSM to model contextual\ndependencies, enabling it to infer user interest from both temporal and\nsequential perspectives. In the training process, the time-aware SSM and the\nrelation-aware SSM are discretized by variable stepsizes according to user\ninteraction time intervals and input data, respectively. This helps capture the\ncontinuous dependency from irregular time intervals and provides time-specific\npersonalized recommendations. Experimental studies on five benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of SS4Rec.",

This paper introduces Selective Self-to-Supervised Fine-Tuning\n(S3FT), a fine-tuning approach that achieves better performance than the\nstandard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while improving generalization. S3FT\nleverages the existence of multiple valid responses to a query. By utilizing\nthe model's correct responses, S3FT reduces model specialization during the\nfine-tuning stage.

The effectiveness of S3FT is demonstrated through\nexperiments on mathematical reasoning, Python programming and reading\ncomprehension tasks. The results show that standard SFT can lead to an average\nperformance drop of up to $4.4$ on multiple benchmarks, such as MMLU and\nTruthfulQA.

Our ensemble method involves\ntraining multiple global policies, where each is learnt by a group of agents\nusing any foundational aggregation rule. These well-trained global policies\nthen individually predict the action for a specific test state. The ultimate\naction is chosen based on a majority vote for discrete action systems or the\ngeometric median for continuous ones. Our experimental results across different\nsettings show that the Normalized attack can greatly disrupt non-ensemble\nByzantine-robust methods, and our ensemble approach offers substantial\nresistance against poisoning attacks.",

    "abstract": "For over a century, researchers have wrestled with how to define good driving\nbehavior, and the debate has surfaced anew for automated vehicles (AVs). We put\nforth the concept of Drivership as a framing for the realization of good\ndriving behaviors. Drivership grounds the evaluation of driving behaviors in\nthe alignment between the mutualistic expectations that exist amongst road\nusers. Leveraging existing literature, we distinguish Empirical Expectations\n(i.e., reflecting \"beliefs that a certain behavior will be followed,\" drawing\non past experiences) (Bicchieri, 2006); and Normative Expectations (i.e.,\nreflecting \"beliefs that a certain behavior ought to be followed,\" based on\nsocietally agreed-upon principles) (Bicchieri, 2006). Because societal\nexpectations naturally shift over time, we introduce a third type of\nexpectation, Furtherance Expectations, denoting behavior which could be\nexhibited to enable continuous improvement of the transportation ecosystem. We\nposition Drivership within the space of societal Normative Expectations, which\nmay overlap with some Empirical and Furtherance Expectations, constrained by\nwhat is technologically and physically feasible.\n  Additionally, we establish a novel vocabulary to rigorously tackle\nconversations on stakeholders' expectations, a key feature of value-sensitive\ndesign. We also detail how Drivership comprises safety-centric behaviors and\nwhat we term socially-aware behaviors (where there are no clear safety stakes).\n  Drivership supports multiple purposes, including advancing the understanding\nand evaluation of driving performance through benchmarking based on many\ncriteria. As such, we argue that an appropriate framing of the notion of\nDrivership also underpins the overall development of a safety case. The paper\nexplores these applications under the more general tenet of Drivership as a\ncentral element to roadway citizenship.",

To address this issue, collaborative perception is\nenvisioned to improve perceptual accuracy by using vehicle-to-everything (V2X)\ncommunication to enable collaboration among connected and autonomous vehicles\nand roadside units. However, due to limited communication resources, it is\nimpractical for all units to transmit sensing data such as point clouds or\nhigh-definition video. As a result, it is essential to optimize the scheduling\nof communication links to ensure efficient spectrum utilization for the\nexchange of perceptual data. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement\nlearning-based V2X user scheduling algorithm for collaborative perception.\nGiven the challenges in acquiring perceptual labels, we reformulate the\nconventional label-dependent objective into a label-free goal, based on\ncharacteristics of 3D object detection. Incorporating both channel state\ninformation (CSI) and semantic information, we develop a double deep Q-Network\n(DDQN)-based user scheduling framework for collaborative perception, named\nSchedCP.

However, existing methods are limited by their\nunidirectional nature, requiring separate models for forward and reverse\ntranslations. This not only doubles the computational cost but also restricts\ntheir practicality. In this work, we introduce the Bidirectional Diffusion\nBridge Model (BDBM), a scalable approach that facilitates bidirectional\ntranslation between two coupled distributions using a single network. BDBM\nleverages the Chapman-Kolmogorov Equation for bridges, enabling it to model\ndata distribution shifts across timesteps in both forward and backward\ndirections by exploiting the interchangeability of the initial and target\ntimesteps within this framework. Notably, when the marginal distribution given\nendpoints is Gaussian, BDBM's transition kernels in both directions possess\nanalytical forms, allowing for efficient learning with a single network. We\ndemonstrate the connection between BDBM and existing bridge methods, such as\nDoob's h-transform and variational approaches, and highlight its advantages.\nExtensive experiments on high-resolution I2I translation tasks demonstrate that\nBDBM not only enables bidirectional translation with minimal additional cost\nbut also outperforms state-of-the-art bridge models.

Integrated Sensing\nand Communication (ISAC) enables this vision by allowing base stations (BSs) to\nallocate bandwidth and power to mobile users (MUs) for communications and\ncooperative sensing. However, this resource allocation is highly challenging\ndue to: (i) dynamic resource demands from MUs and resource supply from BSs, and\n(ii) the selfishness of MUs and BSs. To address these challenges, existing\nsolutions rely on either real-time (online) resource trading, which incurs high\noverhead and failures, or static long-term (offline) resource contracts, which\nlack flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Future Resource\nBank for ISAC, a hybrid trading framework that integrates offline and online\nresource allocation through a level-wise client model, where MUs and their\ncoalitions negotiate with BSs. We introduce two mechanisms: (i) Role-Friendly\nWin-Win Matching (offRFW$^2$M), leveraging overbooking to establish risk-aware,\nstable contracts, and (ii) Effective Backup Win-Win Matching (onEBW$^2$M),\nwhich dynamically reallocates unmet demand and surplus supply.

These features make them promising candidates for\napplications in spintronics devices. Among candidate materials, CrSb is\npromising because of its high ordering temperature (~705 K) and large\nspin-splitting energy; however, it is predicted that tuning the N\\'eel vector\nrequires additional symmetry breaking or a change in the easy magnetization\naxis. While applying epitaxial strain can modulate the symmetry, the selection\nof substrates with closely matched lattice constants for heteroepitaxial growth\nis limited for altermagnets, which generally have low crystal symmetry.\nTherefore, exploring the heteroepitaxial growth of altermagnet thin films on\nwell-established, dissimilar crystal systems is valuable. (001)-oriented III-V\nsemiconductors, which share group-V elements with the overgrown CrSb, offer an\nideal platform because they are expected to have material compatibility with\nstable interfaces, as well as tunability of the buffer layer's bandgap and\nlattice constant by varying the atomic composition of their group-III and\ngroup-V atoms. In this study, we have achieved the molecular beam epitaxial\ngrowth of a CrSb ($\\bar{1}10$) thin film on a GaAs (001) substrate by inserting\nthin FeSb ($\\bar{1}10$) / AlAs (001) buffer layers.

In this paper, we develop the theory of perfect\nstate transfer (PST) between real pure states with emphasis on the adjacency\nand Laplacian matrices as Hamiltonians of a graph representing a quantum spin\nnetwork. We characterize PST between real pure states based on the spectral\ninformation of a graph and prove three fundamental results: (i) every periodic\nreal pure state $\\mathbf{x}$ admits perfect state transfer with another real\npure state $\\mathbf{y}$, (ii) every connected graph admits perfect state\ntransfer between real pure states, and (iii) for any pair of real pure states\n$\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ and for any time $\\tau$, there exists a real\nsymmetric matrix $M$ such that $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ admits perfect\nstate transfer relative to $M$ at time $\\tau$. We also determine all real pure\nstates that admit PST in complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and\ncycles. This leads to a complete characterization of pair and plus state\ntransfer in paths and complete bipartite graphs. We give constructions of\ngraphs that admit PST between real pure states. Finally, using results on the\nspread of graphs, we prove that amongst all $n$-vertex simple unweighted\ngraphs, the least minimum PST time between real pure states relative to the\nLaplacian is attained by any join graph, while the it is attained by the join\nof an empty graph and a complete graph of appropriate sizes relative to the\nadjacency matrix.",

    "abstract": "Energy systems modeling frequently relies on time series data, whether\nobserved or forecast. This is particularly the case, for example, in capacity\nplanning models that use hourly production and load data forecast to occur over\nthe coming several decades. This paper addresses the attendant problem of\nperforming sensitivity, robustness, and other post-solution analyses using time\nseries data. We explore two efficient and relatively simple, non-parametric,\nbootstrapping methods for generating arbitrary numbers of time series from a\nsingle observed or forecast series. The paper presents and assesses each\nmethod. We find that the generated series are both visually and by statistical\nsummary measures close to the original observational data. In consequence these\nseries are credibly taken as stochastic instances from a common distribution,\nthat of the original series of observations. With climate change in mind, the\npaper further proposes and explores two general techniques for systematically\naltering (increasing or decreasing) time series. Both for the perturbed and\nunperturbed synthetic series data, we find that the generated series induce\nvariability in properties of the series that are important for energy modeling,\nin particular periods of under- and over-production, and periods of increased\nramping rates. In consequence, series produced in this way are apt for use in\nrobustness, sensitivity, and in general post-solution analysis of energy\nplanning models.

Here, we show that the\nartificial neural network system can autonomously categorize metric spaces\nthrough representation learning to satisfy the algebraic independence between\nneural networks, and project sensory information onto multiple high-dimensional\nmetric spaces to independently evaluate the differences and similarities\nbetween features. Conventional methods often constrain the axes of the latent\nspace to be mutually independent or orthogonal. However, the independent axes\nare not suitable for categorizing metric spaces. High-dimensional metric spaces\nthat are independent of each other are not uniquely determined by the mutually\nindependent axes, because any combination of independent axes can form mutually\nindependent spaces. In other words, the mutually independent axes cannot be\nused to naturally categorize different feature spaces, such as color space and\nshape space. Therefore, constraining the axes to be mutually independent makes\nit difficult to categorize high-dimensional metric spaces. To overcome this\nproblem, we developed a method to constrain only the spaces to be mutually\nindependent and not the composed axes to be independent.

However,\naccurately capturing fine-grained global and regional feature representations\nremains a challenge. Many existing methods obtain suboptimal performance on\ncomplex lesion segmentation due to information loss during typical downsampling\noperations and the insufficient capture of either regional or global features.\nTo address these issues, we propose the Global and Regional Compensation\nSegmentation Framework (GRCSF), which introduces two key innovations: the\nGlobal Compensation Unit (GCU) and the Region Compensation Unit (RCU). The\nproposed GCU addresses resolution loss in the U-shaped backbone by preserving\nglobal contextual features and fine-grained details during multiscale\ndownsampling. Meanwhile, the RCU introduces a self-supervised learning (SSL)\nresidual map generated by Masked Autoencoders (MAE), obtained as pixel-wise\ndifferences between reconstructed and original images, to highlight regions\nwith potential lesions. These SSL residual maps guide precise lesion\nlocalization and segmentation through a patch-based cross-attention mechanism\nthat integrates regional spatial and pixel-level features. Additionally, the\nRCU incorporates patch-level importance scoring to enhance feature fusion by\nleveraging global spatial information from the backbone. Experiments on two\npublicly available medical image segmentation datasets, including brain stroke\nlesion and coronary artery calcification datasets, demonstrate that our GRCSF\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, confirming its effectiveness across\ndiverse lesion types and its potential as a generalizable lesion segmentation\nsolution.",

    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP). However, its vast potential remains largely\nunexplored for graphs. This raises an interesting question: How can we design\nCoT prompting for graphs to guide graph models to learn step by step? On one\nhand, unlike natural languages, graphs are non-linear and characterized by\ncomplex topological structures. On the other hand, many graphs lack textual\ndata, making it difficult to formulate language-based CoT prompting. In this\nwork, we propose the first CoT prompt learning framework for text-free graphs,\nGCoT. Specifically, we decompose the adaptation process for each downstream\ntask into a series of inference steps, with each step consisting of\nprompt-based inference, ``thought'' generation, and thought-conditioned prompt\nlearning. While the steps mimic CoT prompting in NLP, the exact mechanism\ndiffers significantly. Specifically, at each step, an input graph, along with a\nprompt, is first fed into a pre-trained graph encoder for prompt-based\ninference. We then aggregate the hidden layers of the encoder to construct a\n``thought'', which captures the working state of each node in the current step.\nConditioned on this thought, we learn a prompt specific to each node based on\nthe current state. These prompts are fed into the next inference step,\nrepeating the cycle. To evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of GCoT, we\nconduct comprehensive experiments on eight public datasets, which demonstrate\nthe advantage of our approach.",

As the linearly unstable Mack modes extract energy from the\nmean flow, the perturbation energy cascades into higher harmonics as well as\nthe mean flow. The higher harmonics are generated with < 0.5% of total\nperturbation energy at steady state, indicating a very small role of higher\nharmonics in 2D. Additionally, the higher harmonics propagate with the same\nphase speed as the unstable mode, indicating wave steepening and a coherent\nenergy cascade. The mean flow gets decelerated and heated due to the continuous\nextraction of the perturbation energy into traveling modes and the viscous\ndissipation of these modes. Unlike unstable modes in classical hydrodynamics,\nwe show that the distortion in relative phasing between the streamwise velocity\nand wall-normal velocity due to nonlinear distortion of the mean flow is\ndominant. Using asymptotic reconstruction of the unstable eigenmodes, we\ncompute the perturbation energy budgets in the linear and nonlinear regimes.\nThrough energy budgets, we show that the viscous effects in the wall layer and\nthe viscous effects in the critical layer sufficiently capture the distortion\nin phase due to the mean-flow distortion.

Yet,\nthese instruments have yet to prove capable of reliably detecting the finest\nflaws that influence LPBF component mechanical performance, limiting their\nadoption. One hindrance lies in interpreting measurements of radiance as\ntemperature, despite the physical link between these variables being readily\nunderstood as a combination of Plank's Law and spectral emissivity. Uncertainty\nin spectral emissivity arises as it is nearly impossible to predict and can be\na strong function of wavelength; in turn, this manifests uncertainty in\nestimated temperatures and thereby obscures the LPBF process dynamics that\nindicate component defects. This paper presents temperature emissivity\nseparation (TES) as a method for accurate retrieval of optically-measured\ntemperatures in LPBF. TES simultaneously calculates both temperature and\nspectral emissivity from spectrally-resolved radiance measurements and, as the\nlatter term is effectively measured, more accurate process temperatures result.\nUsing a bespoke imaging spectrometer integrated with an LPBF testbed to\nevaluate this approach, three basic TES algorithms are compared in a validation\nexperiment that demonstrates retrieval of temperatures accurate to $\\pm 28$ K\nover a $1000$ K range. A second investigation proves industrial feasibility\nthrough fabrication of an LPBF test artifact.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to Chinese characters through the lens\nof physics, network analysis, and natural systems. Computational analysis of\nover 6,000 characters identified 422 elemental characters as fundamental\nbuilding blocks. Using a physics-inspired \"Zi-Matrix\" model, we analyzed\ncharacter structure across eleven spatial positions, revealing systematic\npatterns in component relationships and semantic extension. Our research\ndemonstrates that Chinese characters exhibit properties of natural systems:\nemergent complexity, self-organization, and adaptive resilience. The Fibonacci\nsequence provides an organizing framework for understanding character\nevolution, from simple pictographs to sophisticated abstractions. Case studies\nof character families and semantic networks show how meaning radiates from\nconcrete to abstract domains while maintaining coherent principles. By viewing\nChinese characters as a living system, this research transcends mere\nsimplification to reveal how human cognition organizes and transmits knowledge.\nWhile the elemental character set reduces memorization burden, it also\nilluminates profound connections between language, thought, and natural\npatterns. Chinese characters emerge not just as tools for communication, but as\nwindows into human understanding. This perspective, combined with AI-assisted\nlearning approaches, promises to transform language education from knowledge\nmastery to meaning discovery, bridging traditional wisdom with modern\ncomputational methods.",

Generating such samples is a hard computational problem due to the\ninherent complexity of digital circuits, size of the search space, and resource\nconstraints involved in the process. Addressing these challenges has prompted\nthe development of specialized algorithms that heavily rely on heuristics.\nHowever, these heuristic-based approaches frequently encounter scalability\nissues when tasked with sampling from a larger number of solutions, primarily\ndue to their sequential nature. Different from such heuristic algorithms, we\npropose a novel differentiable sampler for multi-level digital circuits, called\n{\\sc Demotic}, that utilizes gradient descent (GD) to solve the CircuitSAT\nproblem and obtain a wide range of valid and distinct solutions. {\\sc Demotic}\nleverages the circuit structure of the problem instance to learn valid\nsolutions using GD by re-framing the CircuitSAT problem as a supervised\nmulti-output regression task. This differentiable approach allows bit-wise\noperations to be performed independently on each element of a tensor, enabling\nparallel execution of learning operations, and accordingly, GPU-accelerated\nsampling with significant runtime improvements compared to state-of-the-art\nheuristic samplers. We demonstrate the superior runtime performance of {\\sc\nDemotic} in the sampling task across various CircuitSAT instances from the\nISCAS-85 benchmark suite.

    "abstract": "The structural stability and phonon properties of SnSe/SnS superlattices at\nfinite temperatures have been studied using machine learning force field\nmolecular dynamics and the anharmonic phonon approach. The vertical SnSe/SnS\nsuperlattice undergoes a phase transition from the Pnma phase to a novel P4/nmm\nphase at finite temperatures, which is different from the high-temperature Cmcm\nphase of the SnSe and SnS systems. The stability of P4/nmm phase is determined\nby molecular dynamics trajectories and anharmonic phonon dispersion relations.\nThe imaginary modes of TO modes at the q=M(1/2,1/2,0) point of the P4/nmm phase\nin harmonic approximation become rigid at elevated temperatures. An analysis of\nphonon power spectra upon temperature also confirms the dynamic stabilization.\nThe P4/nmm phase has higher symmetry than the Pnma phase, and the phase\ntransition between them is accompanied by competition between the Jahn-Teller\neffect and phonon anharmonicity. Unlike the anisotropic distribution of Sn-Se/S\nbonds in the Pnma phase, the P4/nmm phase forms chemical bonds with similar\nbond lengths both in-plane and interlayer, and their resonance effect can\nsignificantly enhance phonon scattering. The calculated phonon density of\nstates and lifetime is strongly temperature dependent, demonstrating the heavy\nanharmonicity in the SnSe/SnS system. The P4/nmm phase has an extremely low\nlattice thermal conductivity, close to the experimental values of SnSe and SnS.\nMoreover, with the reduction of band gap and the enhancement of band degeneracy\nnear the Fermi level, the P4/nmm phase exhibits superior electronic transport\nproperties and significantly enhanced response to infrared and visible light.\nThis makes it show great potential in thermoelectric and photovoltaic\napplications.",

Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o, hold potential to enhance\ncare but risk perpetuating biases present in their training data. This study\naimed to systematically evaluate whether GPT-4o propagates biases in palliative\ncare responses using adversarially designed datasets. In July 2024, GPT-4o was\nprobed using the Palliative Care Adversarial Dataset (PCAD), and responses were\nevaluated by three palliative care experts in Canada and the United Kingdom\nusing validated bias rubrics. The PCAD comprised PCAD-Direct (100 adversarial\nquestions) and PCAD-Counterfactual (84 paired scenarios). These datasets\ntargeted four care dimensions (access to care, pain management, advance care\nplanning, and place of death preferences) and three identity axes (ethnicity,\nage, and diagnosis). Bias was detected in a substantial proportion of\nresponses. For adversarial questions, the pooled bias rate was 0.33 (95%\nconfidence interval [CI]: 0.28, 0.38); \"allows biased premise\" was the most\nfrequently identified source of bias (0.47; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.55), such as\nfailing to challenge stereotypes. For counterfactual scenarios, the pooled bias\nrate was 0.26 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.31), with \"potential for withholding\" as the\nmost frequently identified source of bias (0.25; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.34), such as\nwithholding interventions based on identity. Bias rates were consistent across\ncare dimensions and identity axes. GPT-4o perpetuates biases in palliative\ncare, with implications for clinical decision-making and equity. The PCAD\ndatasets provide novel tools to assess and address LLM bias in palliative care.",

However, when graph-structured side\ninformation (e.g., multimodal similarity graphs or social networks) is\nintegrated into the U-I bipartite graph, existing graph collaborative filtering\nmethods fall short of achieving satisfactory performance. We quantitatively\nanalyze this problem from a spectral perspective. Recall that a bipartite graph\npossesses a full spectrum within the range of [-1, 1], with the highest\nfrequency exactly achievable at -1 and the lowest frequency at 1; however, we\nobserve as more side information is incorporated, the highest frequency of the\naugmented adjacency matrix progressively shifts rightward. This spectrum shift\nphenomenon has caused previous approaches built for the full spectrum [-1, 1]\nto assign mismatched importance to different frequencies. To this end, we\npropose Spectrum Shift Correction (dubbed SSC), incorporating shifting and\nscaling factors to enable spectral GNNs to adapt to the shifted spectrum.\nUnlike previous paradigms of leveraging side information, which necessitate\ntailored designs for diverse data types, SSC directly connects traditional\ngraph collaborative filtering with any graph-structured side information.\nExperiments on social and multimodal recommendation demonstrate the\neffectiveness of SSC, achieving relative improvements of up to 23% without\nincurring any additional computational overhead.

In such a quantum refrigerator system, the MW resonator is\ncoupled with many three-level or four-level systems. Proper light pump makes\nthe multilevel systems concentrated into their ground states, which\ncontinuously absorb the thermal photons in the MW resonator. By adiabatic\nelimination, we give a more precise description for this cooling process. For\nthree level systems, though the laser driving can cool down the multilevel\nsystems efficiently, a too strong driving strength also significantly perturbs\ntheir energy levels, breaking the resonant interaction between the atom and the\nresonator, which weakens the cooling effect, and that sets a finite region for\ncooling parameters. In four level systems, by adopting an indirect pumping\napproach, such a finite cooling region can be further released.

For example, in Bertrand-type competitions, a small\nreduction in one firm's price can lead that firm to capture the entire demand,\nwhile all others sharply lose all of their customers.\n  We study a representative setting of multi-agent performative prediction in\nwhich insensitivity assumptions do not hold, and investigate the convergence of\nnatural dynamics.

Consumers act similarly as to in a Bertrand Competition, with each\nconsumer selecting the firm with the lowest interest rate that they are\neligible for based on the firms' credit thresholds. Our analysis characterizes\nthe equilibria of this game and demonstrates that when both firms use a common\nand natural no-regret learning dynamic -- exponential weights -- with proper\ninitialization, the dynamics always converge to stable outcomes despite the\ngeneral-sum structure. Notably, our setting admits multiple stable equilibria,\nwith convergence dependent on initial conditions. We also provide theoretical\nconvergence results in the stochastic case when the utility matrix is not fully\nknown, but each learner can observe sufficiently many samples of consumers at\neach time step to estimate it, showing robustness to slight mis-specifications.\nFinally, we provide experimental results that validate our theoretical\nfindings.",

Inspired by the\npedagogical method of \"proof by counterexamples\" commonly used in human\nmathematics education, our work aims to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct\nmathematical reasoning and proof through counterexamples. Specifically, we\nmanually create a high-quality, university-level mathematical benchmark,\nCounterMATH, which requires LLMs to prove mathematical statements by providing\ncounterexamples, thereby assessing their grasp of mathematical concepts.\nAdditionally, we develop a data engineering framework to automatically obtain\ntraining data for further model improvement. Extensive experiments and detailed\nanalyses demonstrate that CounterMATH is challenging, indicating that LLMs,\nsuch as OpenAI o1, have insufficient counterexample-driven proof capabilities.\nMoreover, our exploration into model training reveals that strengthening LLMs'\ncounterexample-driven conceptual reasoning abilities is crucial for improving\ntheir overall mathematical capabilities.

Since the two density\ndistributions give the same nucleus size and deformation, they lead to similar\nmid-rapidity observables.

Recent efforts attempt to\naddress this tradeoff by enforcing checks on client updates using\nzero-knowledge proofs, but they support limited predicates and often depend on\npublic validation data. We propose SLVR, a general framework that securely\nleverages clients' private data through secure multi-party computation.

Traditional robot\nmanipulation approaches struggle with the complexity of non-prehensile or\nbimanual strategies commonly used by humans in these circumstances.\nState-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods are unsuitable due to the\ninherent complexity of the task. In contrast, learning from demonstration\nrequires collecting a significant number of expert demonstrations, which is\noften infeasible. Instead, inspired by human bimanual manipulation strategies,\nwhere two hands coordinate to stabilise and reorient objects, we focus on a\nbimanual robotic setup to tackle this challenge. In particular, we introduce\nConstraint-based Manipulation for Bimanual Occluded Grasping (COMBO-Grasp), a\nlearning-based approach which leverages two coordinated policies: a constraint\npolicy trained using self-supervised datasets to generate stabilising poses and\na grasping policy trained using RL that reorients and grasps the target object.\nA key contribution lies in value function-guided policy coordination.\nSpecifically, during RL training for the grasping policy, the constraint\npolicy's output is refined through gradients from a jointly trained value\nfunction, improving bimanual coordination and task performance. Lastly,\nCOMBO-Grasp employs teacher-student policy distillation to effectively deploy\npoint cloud-based policies in real-world environments.

We also compared the performance of human-ML\npairs with human-only pairs when selecting studies. [Results] The ML models\nachieved a modest F-score of 0.33, which is insufficient for reliable\nautomation. However, we found that such models can reduce the study selection\neffort by 33.9% without loss of evidence (keeping a 100% recall). Our analysis\nalso showed that the initial screening by pairs of human reviewers produces\nresults that are much better aligned with the final SLR update result.\n[Conclusion] Based on our results, we conclude that although ML models can help\nreduce the effort involved in SLR updates, achieving rigorous and reliable\noutcomes still requires the expertise of experienced human reviewers for the\ninitial screening phase.",

This issue is\nwidespread in real application scenarios, but existing benchmarks fail to\nevaluate it.

Experimental evaluation shows that\nWorldGUI-Agent outperforms the outstanding existing model (Claude-3.5 Computer\nUse) by 12.4% in success rate on WorldGUI, and achieves a 31.2% overall success\nrate on WindowsAgentArena, surpassing the prior state-of-the-art by 11.7%.

The mode is restricted to\na wavelet pulse and computed from an SVD of the windowed wavelet-based\nresolvent operator so that it produces the largest amplification via the\nlinearised Navier-Stokes equations. We then inject this time-localised mode\ninto the turbulent minimal flow unit at different intensities, and measure the\ninstantaneous deviation of the system's response from the optimal resolvent\nresponse mode. This is possible under the new formulation, which enables the\nmodes to represent transient trajectories. For the most energetic spatial wave\nnumbers in the minimal flow unit -- constant in the streamwise direction and\nonce-periodic in the spanwise direction -- the forcing mode takes the shape of\nstreamwise rolls and produces a response mode in the form of streamwise streaks\nthat transiently grow and decay. For initial times and close to the wall, the\nDNS response matches the principal response mode well, but due to\nnonlinearities, the response across all forcing intensities decays prematurely,\nand a higher forcing intensity leads to faster energy decay. The principal\nforcing mode still leads to significant energy amplification and is more\neffective than a randomly-generated forcing structure and the second suboptimal\nresolvent forcing mode at amplifying the near-wall streaks. We compute the\nnonlinear energy transfer to secondary modes and observe that the breakdown of\nthe actuated mode proceeds similarly across all forcing intensities: in the\nnear-wall region, the induced streak forks into a structure twice periodic in\nthe spanwise direction; in the outer region, the streak breaks up into a\nstructure that is once periodic in the streamwise direction. In both regions,\nspanwise gradients account for the dominant share of nonlinear energy transfer.",

We present a 3D digital twin for a porous electrode by\ndirect numerical solution of the governing Navier-Stokes and Nernst-Planck\nequations for incompressible flow and electrochemical mass transport with\nButler-Volmer reaction kinetics. We demonstrate our method by simulating a\nlaboratory sized system at a sub-fiber scale of $1.25 {\\mu}m$ using a single\nworkstation. We establish convergence and the consistency of mesh refined\nlattices, and review an experimental validation of our model. We show the\nefficacy of two novel techniques to speed convergence to steady state,\niterative upsampling and model refinement. We prove that the state of charge\n($s$) at steady state can be formulated as the solution to a single PDE in $s$\nwith a Dirichlet boundary condition, and introduce a novel figure of merit\n$U_{\\text{mt}}$, the utilization of an electrode geometry at the mass transport\nlimit, both of which can be rapidly simulated with explicit methods from a\ngiven fluid velocity field.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Foundation models, trained on multitudes of public datasets, often\nrequire additional fine-tuning or re-prompting mechanisms to be applied to\nvisually distinct target domains such as surgical videos. Further, without\ndomain knowledge, they cannot model the specific semantics of the target\ndomain. Hence, when applied to surgical video segmentation, they fail to\ngeneralise to sections where previously tracked objects leave the scene or new\nobjects enter. Methods: We propose SASVi, a novel re-prompting mechanism based\non a frame-wise Mask R-CNN Overseer model, which is trained on a minimal amount\nof scarcely available annotations for the target domain. This model\nautomatically re-prompts the foundation model SAM2 when the scene constellation\nchanges, allowing for temporally smooth and complete segmentation of full\nsurgical videos. Results: Re-prompting based on our Overseer model\nsignificantly improves the temporal consistency of surgical video segmentation\ncompared to similar prompting techniques and especially frame-wise\nsegmentation, which neglects temporal information, by at least 1.5%. Our\nproposed approach allows us to successfully deploy SAM2 to surgical videos,\nwhich we quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate for three different\ncholecystectomy and cataract surgery datasets. Conclusion: SASVi can serve as a\nnew baseline for smooth and temporally consistent segmentation of surgical\nvideos with scarcely available annotation data. Our method allows us to\nleverage scarce annotations and obtain complete annotations for full videos of\nthe large-scale counterpart datasets. We make those annotations publicly\navailable, providing extensive annotation data for the future development of\nsurgical data science models.",

    "abstract": "Background: Data collected in controlled settings typically results in\nhigh-quality datasets. However, in real-world applications, the quality of data\ncollection is often compromised. It is well established that the quality of a\ndataset significantly impacts the performance of machine learning models.\n  Methods: A rudimentary error rate metric was developed to evaluate textual\ndataset quality at the token level. Mixtral Large Language Model (LLM) was used\nto quantify and correct errors in low quality datasets. The study analyzed two\nhealthcare datasets: the high-quality MIMIC-III public hospital dataset and a\nlower-quality private dataset from Australian aged care homes. Errors were\nsystematically introduced into MIMIC at varying rates, while the ACH dataset\nquality was improved using the LLM.\n  Results: For the sampled 35,774 and 6,336 patients from the MIMIC and ACH\ndatasets respectively, we used Mixtral to introduce errors in MIMIC and correct\nerrors in ACH. Mixtral correctly detected errors in 63% of progress notes, with\n17% containing a single token misclassified due to medical terminology. LLMs\ndemonstrated potential for improving progress note quality by addressing\nvarious errors. Under varying error rates, feature representation performance\nwas tolerant to lower error rates (<10%) but declined significantly at higher\nrates.\n  Conclusions: The study revealed that models performed relatively well on\ndatasets with lower error rates (<10%), but their performance declined\nsignificantly as error rates increased (>=10%). Therefore, it is crucial to\nevaluate the quality of a dataset before utilizing it for machine learning\ntasks. For datasets with higher error rates, implementing corrective measures\nis essential to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of machine learning\nmodels.",

For a directed unweighted graph $G=(V, E)$ and an integer $d$, a set\nof edges $E'\\subseteq V\\times V$ is called a $d$-TC spanner of $G$ if the graph\n$H:=(V, E')$ has (i) the same transitive-closure as $G$ and (ii) diameter at\nmost $d.$ The set $E''\\subseteq V\\times V$ is a $d$-shortcut of $G$ if $E\\cup\nE''$ is a $d$-TC spanner of $G$. Our focus is on the following $(\\alpha_D,\n\\alpha_S)$-approximation algorithm: given a directed graph $G$ and integers $d$\nand $s$ such that $G$ admits a $d$-shortcut (respectively $d$-TC spanner) of\nsize $s$, find a $(d\\alpha_D)$-shortcut (resp. $(d\\alpha_D)$-TC spanner) with\n$s\\alpha_S$ edges, for as small $\\alpha_S$ and $\\alpha_D$ as possible.\n  As our main result, we show that, under the Projection Game Conjecture (PGC),\nthere exists a small constant $\\epsilon>0$, such that no polynomial-time\n$(n^{\\epsilon},n^{\\epsilon})$-approximation algorithm exists for finding\n$d$-shortcuts as well as $d$-TC spanners of size $s$.

Similar lower bounds for super-constant $d$ were previously\nknown only for a more general case of directed spanners [Elkin, Peleg 2000]. No\nhardness of approximation result was known for shortcuts prior to our result.\n  As a side contribution, we complement the above with an upper bound of the\nform $(n^{\\gamma_D}, n^{\\gamma_S})$-approximation which holds for $3\\gamma_D +\n2\\gamma_S > 1$ (e.g., $(n^{1/5+o(1)}, n^{1/5+o(1)})$-approximation).",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the vulnerability of deep-learning models designed for\nrain, snow, and haze removal. Despite enhancing image quality in adverse\nweather, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks that compromise\ntheir effectiveness. Traditional defenses such as adversarial training and\nmodel distillation often require extensive retraining, making them costly and\nimpractical for real-world deployment. While denoising and super-resolution\ntechniques can aid image classification models, they impose high computational\ndemands and introduce visual artifacts that hinder image processing tasks. We\npropose a model-agnostic defense against first-order white-box adversarial\nattacks using the Quaternion-Hadamard Network (QHNet) to tackle these\nchallenges. White-box attacks are particularly difficult to defend against\nsince attackers have full access to the model's architecture, weights, and\ntraining procedures. Our defense introduces the Quaternion Hadamard Denoising\nConvolutional Block (QHDCB) and the Quaternion Denoising Residual Block (QDRB),\nleveraging polynomial thresholding. QHNet incorporates these blocks within an\nencoder-decoder architecture, enhanced by feature refinement, to effectively\nneutralize adversarial noise. Additionally, we introduce the Adversarial\nWeather Conditions Vision Dataset (AWCVD), created by applying first-order\ngradient attacks on state-of-the-art weather removal techniques in scenarios\ninvolving haze, rain streaks, and snow. Using PSNR and SSIM metrics, we\ndemonstrate that QHNet significantly enhances the robustness of low-level\ncomputer vision models against adversarial attacks compared with\nstate-of-the-art denoising and super-resolution techniques.
