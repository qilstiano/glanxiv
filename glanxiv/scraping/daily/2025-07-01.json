    "abstract": "Spectral modeling codes that estimate photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) are a\npowerful and often reliable method for determining redshifts of galaxies.\nHowever, there are notable instances where degeneracies in spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) colors lead to `catastrophic' failures. We highlight the\ncase of COSBO-7, a dusty, intermediate-$z$ galaxy that masqueraded as a\nhigh-$z$ source, because it demonstrates a unique scenario where photo-$z$\ncodes run into issues despite extensive multi-wavelength photometry. We\nadvocate that photo-$z$ fitting should aim to: (1) use the entire available SED\n(UV--radio) whenever possible to help break color degeneracies, (2) allow\nflexible dust attenuation prescriptions, both in terms of the attenuation curve\nslope and a varying 2175{\\AA} absorption feature, and (3) implement uncertainty\nfloors to account for limitations in spectral models and also on the photometry\nitself.",

    "abstract": "The planned space-based gravitational wave detector, LISA, will provide a\nfundamentally new means of studying the orbital alignment of close white dwarf\nbinaries. However, due to the inherent symmetry of their gravitational wave\nsignals, a fourfold degeneracy arises in the transverse projections of their\nangular momentum vectors. In this paper, we demonstrate that by incorporating\ntiming information from electromagnetic observations, such as radial velocity\nmodulations and light curves, this degeneracy can be reduced to twofold.",

While these models\nhave shown agreement with experimental and numerical results under uniform\nshear rate, their validity across varying shear-rate conditions remains\nuncertain. Here, we employ Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations to\ninvestigate particle size segregation in sheared granular flows under\nwide-ranging shear-rate conditions. We find that the scaling between\nsegregation velocity and local rheological conditions holds only within a\nmoderate inertial number range ($0.01 < I < 0.1$), and breaks down in both\nquasi-static and collisional regimes. Furthermore, we show that this\ndiscrepancy leads continuum models to mispredict segregation rates in\nbidisperse mixtures. These findings emphasize the need for more generalized\nscaling laws capable of capturing segregation dynamics across a broader\nspectrum of shear-rate conditions and regimes.",

    "abstract": "The growing availability of high-resolution, long-term time series data has\nhighlighted the need for methods capable of capturing both local and global\npatterns. To address this, we introduce the Probabilistic Visibility Graph\n(PVG), a novel approach inspired by the quantum tunnelling phenomenon. The PVG\nextends the classical Visibility Graph (VG) by introducing probabilistic\nconnections between time points that are obstructed in the VG due to\nintermediate values. We demonstrate the PVG's effectiveness in capturing\nlong-range dependencies through simulations of amplitude-modulated signals and\nanalysis of electrocorticography (ECoG) data under rest and anesthesia\nconditions. Key results show that the PVG presents distinct network properties\nbetween rest and anesthesia, with rest exhibiting stronger small-worldness and\nscale-free behavior, reflecting a hub-dominated, centralized connectivity\nstructure, compared to anesthesia. These findings highlight the PVG's potential\nfor analyzing complex signals with interacting temporal scales, offering new\ninsights into neural dynamics and other real-world phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing quantum states from measurement data represents a formidable\nchallenge in quantum information science, especially as system sizes grow\nbeyond the reach of traditional tomography methods. While recent studies have\nexplored quantum machine learning (QML) for quantum state tomography (QST),\nnearly all rely on idealized assumptions, such as direct access to the unknown\nquantum state as quantum data input, which are incompatible with current\nhardware constraints. In this work, we present a QML-based tomography protocol\nthat operates entirely on classical measurement data and is fully executable on\nnoisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Our approach employs a\nvariational quantum circuit trained to reconstruct quantum states based solely\non measurement outcomes. We test the method in simulation, achieving\nhigh-fidelity reconstructions of diverse quantum states, including GHZ states,\nspin chain ground states, and states generated by random circuits. The protocol\nis then validated on quantum hardware from IBM and IonQ. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate accurate tomography is possible using incomplete measurement bases,\na crucial step towards scaling up our protocol. Our results in various\nscenarios illustrate successful state reconstruction with fidelity reaching 90%\nor higher. To our knowledge, this is the first QML-based tomography scheme that\nuses exclusively classical measurement data and has been implemented on real\nquantum processors. This work establishes the feasibility of QML-based\ntomography on current quantum platforms and offers a scalable pathway for\npractical quantum state reconstruction.",

However, directly training policies to\nsimultaneously handle dual extreme challenges, i.e., extreme underactuation and\nextreme terrains, as in monopedal hopping tasks, remains highly challenging due\nto unstable early-stage interactions and unreliable reward feedback. To address\nthis, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving\npriors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple\nstages of increasing complexity. By dynamically generating self-evolving priors\nthrough iterative bootstrapping of previously learned policies, JumpER\nprogressively refines and enhances guidance, thereby stabilizing exploration\nand policy optimization without relying on external expert priors or\nhandcrafted reward shaping. Specifically, when integrated with a structured\nthree-stage curriculum that incrementally evolves action modality, observation\nspace, and task objective, JumpER enables quadruped robots to achieve robust\nmonopedal hopping on unpredictable terrains for the first time. Remarkably, the\nresulting policy effectively handles challenging scenarios that traditional\nmethods struggle to conquer, including wide gaps up to 60 cm, irregularly\nspaced stairs, and stepping stones with distances varying from 15 cm to 35 cm.\nJumpER thus provides a principled and scalable approach for addressing\nlocomotion tasks under the dual challenges of extreme underactuation and\nextreme terrains.",

Herein, we provide fundamental\ninsights into hydrogen-based direct reduction (HyDR) of distinct oxide\nprecursors that differ by phase composition and morphology. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the co-reduction of multicomponent metal oxides targeting a\n25Co-25Fe-25Mn-25Ni (at.%) alloy, by using either a compacted powder\n(mechanically mixed oxides) comprising Co3O4-Fe2O3-Mn2O3-NiO or a pre-sintered\ncompound (chemically mixed oxides) comprising a Co,Ni-rich halite and a\nFe,Mn-rich spinel. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at a heating rate of 10\n{\\deg}C/min reveals that the reduction onset temperature for the compacted\npowder was ~175 {\\deg}C, whereas it was significantly delayed to ~525 {\\deg}C\nfor the pre-sintered sample. Nevertheless, both sample types attained a similar\nreduction degree (~80%) after isothermal holding for 1 h at 700 {\\deg}C. Phase\nanalysis and microstructural characterization of reduced samples confirmed the\npresence of metallic Co, Fe, and Ni alongside MnO. A minor fraction of Fe\nremains unreduced, stabilized in the (Fe,Mn)O halite phase, in accord with\nthermodynamic calculations. Furthermore, ~1 wt.% of BCC phase was found only in\nthe reduced pre-sintered sample, owing to the different reduction pathways. The\nkinetics and thermodynamics effects were decoupled by performing HyDR\nexperiments on pulverized pre-sintered samples. These findings demonstrate that\ninitial precursor states influence both the reduction behavior and the\nmicrostructural evolution, providing critical insights for the sustainable\nproduction of multicomponent alloys.",

The relationship between swing\nmetrics and swing outcomes is confounded by the batter's pitch recognition. We\nintroduce a framework for interpreting bat tracking data in which we first\nestimate the batter's intention conditional on ball-strike count and pitch\nlocation using a Bayesian hierarchical skew-normal model with random intercept\nand random slopes for batter. This yields batter-specific effects of count on\nswing metrics, which we leverage via instrumental variables regression to\nestimate causal effects of bat speed and swing length on contact and power\noutcomes. Finally, we valuate the tradeoff between contact and power due to bat\nspeed by modeling a plate appearance as a Markov chain.

Building on this theorem, we introduce a new\nstatistical notion: We declare a metric Polish probability space to be\nasymptotically disintegrable if $n$ i.i.d.-centred balls of decreasing radius\ncarry a disintegration of the measure with probability tending to unity as\n$n\\rightarrow\\infty$. We give a number of both $1$-dimensional and\nhigher-dimensional examples of asymptotically disintegrable spaces with\nassociated quantitative rates, as well as a strong counterexample. Finally, we\ngive two applications of the notion of asymptotic disintegrability. First, we\nprove that asymptotically disintegrable spaces admit an easy high-probability\nquantification of the law of large numbers in Wasserstein space, which in all\ndimensions either recovers or improves upon the best known rates in some\nregimes, and is never any worse than existing rates by more than a factor of 2\nin the exponent of $n$, where $n$ is the number of sample points. Second, we\nprove that any asymptotically disintegrable space admits a high-probability\nbound on the error in approximating the expectation of any Lipschitz function\nby its empirical average over an i.i.d.\\ sample.

    "abstract": "Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet\nindividual conditions often remain poorly characterized and difficult to\ndiagnose due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. While\ncomputational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease\ndetection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and\nbiases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and\nexpert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and\nthe cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health\nrecords (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial\nnoise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,\ntransformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels\nwith a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from\nEHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and\ngeneralizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the\nscope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning\nembeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence\npatterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level\nrepresentations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare\npulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from\nBoston Children's Hospital. Our framework demonstrates notable improvements in\nphenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes\nthrough patient clustering, and prediction of disease progression compared to\nbaseline methods. These results highlight the potential of our approach to\nenable scalable identification and stratification of rare disease patients for\nclinical care and research applications.",

    "abstract": "Earlier this year, Apple ignited controversy by publishing \"The Illusion of\nThinking,\" prompting heated debate within the AI community. Critics seized upon\nthe findings as conclusive evidence that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack\ngenuine reasoning capabilities, branding them as mere stochastic parrots.\nMeanwhile, defenders-spearheaded by Lawsen et al. (2025)-fired back, condemning\nthe experimental setup as flawed and the conclusions overstated. We clarify\nthis debate by replicating and refining two of the original study's most\ncontentious benchmarks: Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing. By introducing\nincremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue, we show that\npreviously reported failures solving the Towers of Hanoi were not purely result\nof output constraints, but also partly a result of cognition limitations: LRMs\nstill stumble when complexity rises moderately (around 8 disks). Moreover, the\nRiver Crossing results initially heralded as catastrophic failures turn out to\nhinge upon testing unsolvable configurations. Once we limit tests strictly to\nsolvable problems-LRMs effortlessly solve large instances involving over 100\nagent pairs. Our findings ultimately defy simplistic narratives: today's LRMs\nare stochastic, RL-tuned searchers in a discrete state space we barely\nunderstand. Real progress in symbolic, long-horizon reasoning demands mapping\nthat terrain through fine-grained ablations like those introduced here.",

    "abstract": "High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block\nof scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS)\napproach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based\non photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success\nprobability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining\na passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or\nintermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a\nprimary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity\nand the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing\nprotocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations\nby protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity\ndynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities\nare sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses\nrequired for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed\noperation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate\nentanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration\nleveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for\nexternal photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a\nconcrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal\ncooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \\times\n10^5~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup\nbeyond $10^6~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength\nchannels.

    "abstract": "The ability to find data is central to the FAIR principles underlying\nresearch data stewardship. As with the ability to reuse data, efforts to ensure\nand enhance findability have historically focused on discoverability of data by\nother researchers, but there is a growing recognition of the importance of\nstewarding data in a fashion that makes them FAIR for a wide range of potential\nreusers and stakeholders. Research institutions are one such stakeholder and\nhave a range of motivations for discovering data, specifically those affiliated\nwith a focal institution, from facilitating compliance with funder provisions\nto gathering data to inform research data services. However, many research\ndatasets and repositories are not optimized for institutional discovery (e.g.,\nnot recording or standardizing affiliation metadata), which creates downstream\nobstacles to workflows designed for theoretically comprehensive discovery and\nto metadata-conscious data generators. Here I describe an open-source workflow\nfor institutional tracking of research datasets at the University of Texas at\nAustin. This workflow comprises a multi-faceted approach that utilizes multiple\nopen application programming interfaces (APIs) in order to address some of the\ncommon challenges to institutional discovery, such as variation in whether\naffiliation metadata are recorded or made public, and if so, how metadata are\nstandardized, structured, and recorded. It is presently able to retrieve more\nthan 4,000 affiliated datasets across nearly 70 distinct platforms, including\nobjects without DOIs and objects without affiliation metadata. However, there\nremain major gaps that stem from suboptimal practices of both researchers and\ndata repositories, many of which were identified in previous studies and which\npersist despite significant investment in efforts to standardize and elevate\nthe quality of datasets and their metadata.",

    "abstract": "Extremely large aperture array operating in the near-field regime unlocks\nadditional spatial resources that can be exploited to simultaneously serve\nmultiple users even when they share the same angular direction, a capability\nnot achievable in conventional far-field systems. A fundamental question,\nhowever, remains: What is the maximum spatial degree of freedom (DoF) of\nspatial multiplexing in the distance domain?\n  In this paper, we address this open problem by investigating the spatial DoF\nof a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between a large two-dimensional transmit\naperture and a linear receive array with collinearly-aligned elements (i.e., at\nthe same angular direction) but located at different distances from the\ntransmit aperture. We assume that both the aperture and linear array are\ncontinuous-aperture (CAP) arrays with an infinite number of elements and\ninfinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the spatial degrees\nof freedom (DoF) in the case of finite elements. First, we assume an ideal case\nwhere the transmit array is a single piece and the linear array is on the broad\nside of the transmit array. By reformulating the channel as an integral\noperator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form\nexpression for the spatial DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows\nthat the spatial DoF in the distance domain is predominantly determined by the\nextreme boundaries of the array rather than its detailed interior structure. We\nfurther extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a\nprojection method, which effectively converts the spatial DoF to an equivalent\nbroadside case. Finally, we extend our analytical framework to the modular\narray, which shows the spatial DoF gain over the single-piece array given the\nconstraint of the physical length of the array.",

A foliated\n$p$-adic F-series is a function $X$ of a $p$-adic integer variable\n$\\mathfrak{z}$ satisfying the functional equations\n$X\\left(p\\mathfrak{z}+j\\right)=a_{j}X\\left(\\mathfrak{z}\\right)+b_{j}$ for all\n$\\mathfrak{z}\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ and all $j\\in\\left\\{ 0,\\ldots,p-1\\right\\} $,\nwhere the $a_{j}$s and $b_{j}$s are indeterminates. Treating $X$ as taking\nvalue in a certain ring of formal power series over $K$, this paper establishes\na universal/functorial Fourier theory for F-series: we show that $X$ has a\nFourier transform, and that, for nearly any ideal $I\\subseteq R$, where of\n$R=\\mathcal{O}_{K}\\left[a_{0},\\ldots,a_{p-1},b_{0},\\ldots,b_{p-1}\\right]$, this\nFourier transform descends through the quotient mod $I$ which imposes on $X$\nthe relations encoded by $I$. Furthermore, we show that the pointwise product\nof $X$ with itself $n$ times also has a Fourier transform compatible with\ndescent. These results generalize to products $X_{1}^{e_{1}}\\cdots\nX_{d}^{e_{d}}$ of any $d$ distinct F-series $X_{1},\\ldots,X_{d}$ with integer\nexponents $e_{1},\\ldots,e_{d}\\geq0$. Using these Fourier transforms, F-series\nand their products can be identified with distributions on $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ in\na manner compatible with descent mod $I$, forming algebras under pointwise\nmultiplication. Also, to any given F-series or product thereof, one can\nassociate an affine algebraic variety over $K$ which I call the breakdown\nvariety. The distributions induced by a product of F-series under descent mod\n$I$ exhibit sensitivity to $I$'s containment of the ideal corresponding to the\ndistributions' breakdown varieties. This yields a novel method of encoding\ngiven affine algebraic varieties through distributions in a way compatible with\npointwise products, convolutions, and tensor products.",

The ring is generated by a set of primary invariants, while the\nmodule structure is determined by a finite set of secondary invariants. In this\nwork, we show that the number of primary invariants can be computed by\nperforming a complete gauge fixing, which identifies the number of independent\nphysical degrees of freedom.

Last but not\nleast, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive adapter side-network design which\nmakes the server train the adapter modules based on device-defined prediction\ndifferences rather than raw ground-truth labels.

Existing methods often trade off efficiency for performance:\ntraditional LSTM or RNN models struggle to capture long-range dependencies,\ntransformer-based methods are computationally costly, and Mamba-based\napproaches rely on CUDA and weaken local dependency modeling. The recently\nproposed Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) model offers a promising\nalternative by effectively capturing long-range dependencies through\nexponential gating and enhanced memory variants, sLSTM for modeling local\ndependencies, and mLSTM for scalable, parallelizable memory. However, xLSTM's\napplication in ABSA remains unexplored. To address this, we introduce\nAspect-aware Flip-and-Fuse xLSTM (AF-MAT), a framework that leverages xLSTM's\nstrengths. AF-MAT features an Aspect-aware matrix LSTM (AA-mLSTM) mechanism\nthat introduces a dedicated aspect gate, enabling the model to selectively\nemphasize tokens semantically relevant to the target aspect during memory\nupdates. To model multi-scale context, we incorporate a FlipMix block that\nsequentially applies a partially flipped Conv1D (pf-Conv1D) to capture\nshort-range dependencies in reverse order, followed by a fully flipped mLSTM\n(ff-mLSTM) to model long-range dependencies via full sequence reversal.\nAdditionally, we propose MC2F, a lightweight Multihead Cross-Feature Fusion\nbased on mLSTM gating, which dynamically fuses AA-mLSTM outputs (queries and\nkeys) with FlipMix outputs (values) for adaptive representation integration.\nExperiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AF-MAT outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher accuracy in ABSA tasks.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence rate of cold Jupiters was found to depend on stellar mass. The\nformation environment in the protoplanetary disks regulates core formation and\nthe subsequent gas accretion. In this study, we simulate giant planet formation\nvia pebble accretion accounting for various stellar masses, core formation\ntimes, disk turbulent viscosities, and grain opacities. We use a\nself-consistent formation model that calculates the solid accretion rate and\ngas accretion rate of growing protoplanets. We investigate how the planetary\nformation, in particular, the contraction of the envelope, and the formation\ntimescale change under different conditions. We find that to reproduce the\nobserved occurrence rate of cold Jupiters, giant planets must undergo slow\nenvelope contraction after they reach pebble isolation, which lasts for several\nMyrs. Such a slow contraction phase can be achieved when the grain opacity is\nassumed to be as high as that of the interstellar medium (ISM). If the grain\nopacity is smaller than the ISM opacity by a factor of ten or more, the growing\nprotoplanets reach crossover mass within 3 Myrs and form too many cold Jupiters\naround stars of >0.4Msun. Protoplanets around low-mass stars <0.4Msun take >10\nMyrs to reach crossover mass also with low grain opacity. If the grain opacity\nin the planetary envelope is much lower than that of ISM, other mechanisms,\nsuch as atmospheric recycling or planetesimal accretion, is required for cold\nJupiter formation. We next explore how the deposition of the accreted heavy\nelements to the planetary envelope changes the formation timescale. Our model\nsuggests that the formation timescale could be longer due to heavy-element\nenrichment, resulting from the lower core mass at pebble isolation. We conclude\nthat the details of the formation processes have a significant effect on the\nplanetary growth and therefore, the formation of gaseous planets.",

This allowed\na systematic comparison of expert-based versus automated feature selection.\n  Ensemble methods (e.g. CatBoost, LightGBM) delivered top performance. The\ndomain-informed model $\\mathcal M_2$ achieved the best balance: test RMSE\n$\\approx$ 30.6 MPa and $R^2 \\approx 0.780% over the full $\\Delta\n\\sigma_{c,50\\%}$ range, and RMSE $\\approx$ 13.4 MPa and $R^2 \\approx 0.527%\nwithin the engineering-relevant 0 - 150 MPa domain. The denser-feature model\n($\\mathcal M_3$) showed minor gains during training but poorer generalization,\nwhile the simpler base-feature model ($\\mathcal M_1$) performed comparably,\nconfirming the robustness of minimalist designs.\n  XAI methods (SHAP and feature importance) identified stress ratio $R$, stress\nrange $\\Delta \\sigma_i$, yield strength $R_{eH}$, and post-weld treatment (TIG\ndressing vs. as-welded) as dominant predictors. Secondary geometric factors -\nplate width, throat thickness, stiffener height - also significantly affected\nfatigue life.\n  This framework demonstrates that integrating AutoML with XAI yields accurate,\ninterpretable, and robust fatigue strength models for welded steel structures.\nIt bridges data-driven modeling with engineering validation, enabling\nAI-assisted design and assessment. Future work will explore probabilistic\nfatigue life modeling and integration into digital twin environments.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the intensity-based inversion method (IIM) for\nquantitative material parameter estimation in quasi-static elastography. In\nparticular, we consider the problem of estimating the material parameters of a\ngiven sample from two internal measurements, one obtained before and one after\napplying some form of deformation. These internal measurements can be obtained\nvia any imaging modality of choice, for example ultrasound, optical coherence\nor photo-acoustic tomography. Compared to two-step approaches to elastography,\nwhich first estimate internal displacement fields or strains and then\nreconstruct the material parameters from them, the IIM is a one-step approach\nwhich computes the material parameters directly from the internal measurements.\nTo do so, the IIM combines image registration together with a model-based,\nregularized parameter reconstruction approach. This combination has the\nadvantage of avoiding some approximations and derivative computations typically\nfound in two-step approaches, and results in the IIM being generally more\nstable to measurement noise. In the paper, we provide a full convergence\nanalysis of the IIM within the framework of inverse problems, and detail its\napplication to linear elastography. Furthermore, we discuss the numerical\nimplementation of the IIM and provide numerical examples simulating an optical\ncoherence elastography (OCE) experiment.",

    "abstract": "Medical Image Grounding (MIG), which involves localizing specific regions in\nmedical images based on textual descriptions, requires models to not only\nperceive regions but also deduce spatial relationships of these regions.\nExisting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for MIG often rely on Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT) with large amounts of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning\nannotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently,\nDeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire\nreasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without\nrequiring CoT annotations.

The three cases analyzed are strontium-87 with an odd number of\nneutrons, lutetium-175 with an odd number of protons, and lutetium-176 with an\nodd number of protons and neutrons.

We address\nthis with the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM), which aligns frozen unimodal\nmodels by jointly training modality-specific autoencoders with coordinated\nreconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives.

    "abstract": "Materials with tailored quantum properties can be engineered from atomic\nscale assembly techniques, but existing methods often lack the agility and\naccuracy to precisely and intelligently control the manufacturing process. Here\nwe demonstrate a fully autonomous approach for fabricating atomic-level defects\nusing electron beams in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) that\ncombines advanced machine learning and automated beam control. As a proof of\nconcept, we achieved controlled fabrication of MoS-nanowire (MoS-NW) edge\nstructures by iterative and targeted exposure of $MoS_2$ monolayer to a focused\nelectron beam to selectively eject sulfur atoms, utilizing high-angle annular\ndark-field (HAADF) imaging for feedback-controlled monitoring structural\nevolution of defects. A machine learning framework combining a random forest\nmodel and convolutional neural networks (CNN) was developed to decode the HAADF\nimage and accurately identify atomic positions and species. This atomic-level\ninformation was then integrated into an autonomous decision-making platform,\nwhich applied predefined fabrication strategies to instruct beam control about\natomic sites to be ejected. The selected sites were subsequently exposed to\nlocalized electron beam using an FPGA-controlled scan routine with precise\ncontrol over beam positioning and duration. While the MoS-NW edge structures\nproduced exhibit promising mechanical and electronic properties, the proposed\nautonomous fabrication framework is material-agnostic and can be extended to\nother 2D materials for the creation of diverse defect structures and\nheterostructures beyond $MoS_2$.",

The more massive component of the GW230529 source binary\nwas inferred to contain a compact object in the lower mass gap, a purported gap\nbetween the most massive neutron stars and least massive black holes based on\ncompact object observations in the Milky Way. However, the properties of the\nmass-gap object, such as its exact mass and spin, remain unresolved due to\nstatistical uncertainties. To investigate the properties of the GW230529 source\nbinary, we perform parameter estimation on a suite of simulated gravitational\nwave systems with similar parameters. We vary the intrinsic properties of the\nsimulated systems, the detector noise properties, the signal-to-noise ratios,\nand the waveform model used in recovery. We find that the low signal-to-noise\nratio of GW230529 is the key reason for the ambiguity in determining whether\nthe mass of the primary object in the binary is consistent with a low-mass\nblack hole or a high-mass neutron star, since the priors for the masses and\nspins have a significant impact on the posterior distribution. The inclusion of\ntidal effects in the waveform model also contributes to the observed\ndegeneracies in the posteriors.

On long-term\ntime-scales, we find a gradual decrease of the S5 0716+714 activity since the\nbeginning of 2020 in both optical and gamma-rays. On short-term time-scales,\nthe individual optical light curves are strongly correlated among each other\nwith no time lags observed. The V-band percentage variability amplitude equals\n97.59 +/- 0.02 per cent. We find moderate flatter-when-brighter spectral\nbehaviour with the strength of the 'spectral index - flux' anti-correlation\ndecreasing towards the longer wavelengths. The main feature of the short-term\nlight curves is a transient quasi-periodic oscillation with a period of 43.5\n+/- 3.6 d. The V-band light curve is modelled with two helically moving blobs\nand a synchrotron flare. We estimate the resulting parameters, as well as\nlimits on the radius, magnetic field strength, and electron Lorentz factor of\nthe region responsible for the flare. On intranight time-scales, we find smooth\nflux variations with no flares and derive a duty cycle in the range ~10-20 per\ncent.

Furthermore, solid-state systems needing only\nsimple thermal control are key to the development of field-deployable compact\nclocks. In this work, we explore and characterize the frequency reproducibility\nof the $^{229}$Th:CaF$_2$ nuclear clock transition, a key performance metric\nfor all clocks. We measure the transition linewidth and center frequency as a\nfunction of the doping concentration, temperature, and time. We report the\nconcentration-dependent inhomogeneous linewidth of the nuclear transition,\nlimited by the intrinsic host crystal properties. We determine an optimal\nworking temperature for the $^{229}$Th:CaF$_2$ nuclear clock at 195(5) K where\nthe first-order thermal sensitivity vanishes. This would enable in-situ\ntemperature co-sensing using different quadrupole-split lines, reducing the\ntemperature-induced systematic shift below the 10$^{-18}$ fractional frequency\nuncertainty level. At 195 K, the reproducibility of the nuclear transition\nfrequency is 280 Hz (fractionally $1.4\\times10^{-13}$) for two differently\ndoped $^{229}$Th:CaF$_2$ crystals over four months.

    "abstract": "Tetramethylammonium (TMA) cadmium azide, is a new perovskite-like compound\nwhich undergoes a series of first-order phase transitions, including a\nferroelastic transition above room temperature. Understanding the\norder-disorder structural phase transition (SPT) mechanism in hybrid\norganic--inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) is crucial for designing new compounds\nwith enhanced barocaloric efficiency, as well as unlocking other\nmultifunctional properties. In this paper, we employed the energy fluctuation\n(EF) model to investigate the experimental linewidth of Raman modes in\nTMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ near the critical phase transition temperature ($T_C =\n{322}{K}$), aiming to gain insights into the molecular dynamics around the SPT.\nThe temperature dependence of the strain, used as an order parameter, was\nobtained using the appropriate thermodynamic potential for the first-order\nphase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$, expressed through a Landau expansion,\nwhich can be successfully employed to model first-order ferroelastic phase\ntransitions. We show that the EF model suitably captures the behavior of the\nRaman linewidths in the vicinity of the structural phase transition in\nTMACd(N$_3$)$_3$. The activation energies obtained for TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ are\ncomparable to those of DMACd(N$_3$)$_3$, as well as to $k_B T_C$. Additionally,\nthe temperature dependence of the relaxation reveals that the torsional and\nlibrational modes require longer to renormalize after the phase transition in\nTMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ when compared with DMACd(N$_3$)$_3$. The discussion based on\nthese new parameters provides a new perspective for understanding molecular\ndynamics in systems undergoing order-disorder phase transitions, particularly\nin ferroelastic transitions, where order-disorder mechanisms are coupled to\nsymmetry-breaking lattice distortions.",

However,\nthe flat Open Circuit Voltage (OCV)-SOC curve makes this task particularly\nchallenging. This challenge is complicated by hysteresis effects, and\nreal-world conditions such as current bias, voltage quantization errors, and\ntemperature that must be considered in the battery management system use. In\nthis paper, we proposed an adaptive estimation approach to overcome the\nchallenges of LFPSOC estimation. Specifically, the method uses an adaptive\nfisher information fusion strategy that adaptively combines the SOC estimation\nfrom two different models, which are Coulomb counting and equivalent circuit\nmodel-based parameter identification. The effectiveness of this strategy is\nrationalized by the information richness excited by external cycling signals. A\n3D OCV-H-SOC map that captures the relationship between OCV, hysteresis, and\nSOC was proposed as the backbone, and can be generalizable to other widely\nadopted parameter-identification methods. Extensive validation under ideal and\nreal-world use scenarios, including SOC-OCV flat zones, current bias, voltage\nquantization errors, low temperatures, and insufficient current excitations,\nhave been performed using 4 driving profiles, i.e., the Orange County Transit\nBus Cycle, the California Unified Cycle, the US06 Drive Cycle, and the New York\nCity Cycle, where the results demonstrate superiority over the state-of-the-art\nunscented Kalman filter, long short-term memory networks and transformer in all\nvalidation cases.",

Traditional control techniques often rely on\nprecise system models and are sensitive to parameter uncertainties and external\nperturbations. To overcome these limitations, we first develop a SAC-based\nexpert controller that demonstrates improved resilience against actuator\nfailures, sensor noise, and attitude misalignments, outperforming our previous\nresults in several challenging scenarios. We then use GAIL to train a learner\npolicy that imitates the expert's trajectories, thereby reducing training costs\nand improving generalization through expert demonstrations. Preliminary\nexperiments under single and combined perturbations show that the SAC expert\ncan rotate the antenna to a specified direction and keep the antenna\norientation reliably stable in most of the listed perturbations. Additionally,\nthe GAIL learner can imitate most of the features from the trajectories\ngenerated by the SAC expert. Comparative evaluations and ablation studies\nconfirm the effectiveness of the SAC algorithm and reward shaping. The\nintegration of GAIL further reduces sample complexity and demonstrates\npromising imitation capabilities, paving the way for more intelligent and\nautonomous spacecraft control systems.",

Orthogonal regressions\nand hierarchical Bayesian models, as well as random forest (RF) analyses, were\nused to establish the fundamental relations at physical scales from 160~pc to\n1~kpc. The gas pressure, is the main driver of the star formation rate (SFR)\nsurface density throughout the whole star-forming disk of M33. High-pressure\nregions enhance the atomic-to-molecular gas conversion, with the molecular\nhydrogen mass surface density being tightly correlated to pressure and a\nuniform scaling law throughout the M33 disk. The relation between pressure and\nSFR surface density differs, showing a change in slope from the inner to the\nouter disk. Scaling laws do not depend on the physical scale and brings out an\nintrinsic scatter linked to variations in the efficiency and relative age of\nthe molecular gas-to-stars conversion. In the inner disk, where spiral arms are\npresent and the stellar surface density dominates gravity, the pressure and SFR\nsurface densidy establish an almost linear correlation with a smaller\ndispersion than that of the molecular gas -- SFR surface density relation.

    "abstract": "A critical challenge in particle physics is combining results from diverse\nexperimental setups that measure the same physical quantity to enhance\nprecision and statistical power, a process known as a global fit. Global fits\nof sterile neutrino searches, hunts for additional neutrino oscillation\nfrequencies and amplitudes, present an intriguing case study. In such a\nscenario, the key assumptions underlying Wilks' theorem, a cornerstone of most\nclassic frequentist analyses, do not hold. The method of Feldman and Cousins, a\ntrials-based approach which does not assume Wilks' theorem, becomes\ncomputationally prohibitive for complex or intractable likelihoods. To bypass\nthis limitation, we borrow a technique from simulation-based inference (SBI) to\nestimate likelihood ratios for use in building trials-based confidence\nintervals, speeding up test statistic evaluations by a factor $>10^4$ per grid\npoint, resulting in a faster, but approximate, frequentist fitting framework.\nApplied to a subset of sterile neutrino search data involving the disappearance\nof muon-flavor (anti)neutrinos, our method leverages machine learning to\ncompute frequentist confidence intervals while significantly reducing\ncomputational expense. In addition, the SBI-based approach holds additional\nvalue by recognizing underlying systematic uncertainties that the Wilks\napproach does not. Thus, our method allows for more robust machine\nlearning-based analyses critical to performing accurate but computationally\nfeasible global fits. This allows, for the first time, a global fit to sterile\nneutrino data without assuming Wilks' theorem. While we demonstrate the utility\nof such a technique studying sterile neutrino searches, it is applicable to\nboth single-experiment and global fits of all kinds.",

Robotic\nultrasound can further enhance its utility by reducing operator dependence and\nimproving access to complex anatomical regions. For this, while deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) and imitation learning (IL) have shown potential\nfor autonomous navigation, their use in complex surgical tasks such as anatomy\nreconstruction and surgical guidance remains limited -- largely due to the lack\nof realistic and efficient simulation environments tailored to these tasks. We\nintroduce SonoGym, a scalable simulation platform for complex robotic\nultrasound tasks that enables parallel simulation across tens to hundreds of\nenvironments. Our framework supports realistic and real-time simulation of US\ndata from CT-derived 3D models of the anatomy through both a physics-based and\na generative modeling approach. Sonogym enables the training of DRL and recent\nIL agents (vision transformers and diffusion policies) for relevant tasks in\nrobotic orthopedic surgery by integrating common robotic platforms and\northopedic end effectors. We further incorporate submodular DRL -- a recent\nmethod that handles history-dependent rewards -- for anatomy reconstruction and\nsafe reinforcement learning for surgery. Our results demonstrate successful\npolicy learning across a range of scenarios, while also highlighting the\nlimitations of current methods in clinically relevant environments.

These reactions can be formally\ndescribed using Fermi's golden rule (FGR) in the weak-coupling limit.\nNonadiabatic instanton theory presents a semiclassical approximation to FGR,\nwhich is directly applicable to molecular systems. However, there are cases\nwhere the theory has not yet been formulated. For instance, in many real-world\nreactions including spin-crossover or proton-coupled electron transfer, the\ncrossing occurs near a barrier on a diabatic state. This scenario gives rise to\ncompeting nonadiabatic reaction pathways, some of which involve tunneling\nthrough a diabatic barrier while simultaneously switching electronic states. To\ndate, no rate theory is available for describing tunneling via these\nunconventional pathways. Here we extend instanton theory to model this class of\nprocesses, which we term the ``non-convex'' regime. Benchmark tests on model\nsystems show that the rates predicted by instanton theory are in excellent\nagreement with quantum-mechanical FGR calculations.

This methodology\nsignificantly advances boundary value problem (BVP) formulation, especially for\nfirst-order approximate theories. For a transversely isotropic elastic solid\nwith a crack, the governing equilibrium equation, derived from linear momentum\nbalance and the nonlinear constitutive model, is reduced to a second-order,\nvector-valued, quasilinear elliptic BVP. This BVP is solved using a robust\nnumerical scheme combining Picard-type linearization with a continuous Galerkin\nfinite element method for spatial discretization. Numerical results are\npresented for various loading conditions, including uniform tension,\nnon-uniform slope, and parabolic loading, with two distinct material fiber\norientations.

This extreme conservation cannot be fully explained by current\nevolutionary theory, which predicts far more variation given the demonstrated\nviability of alternatives. I propose that this paradox--evolutionary\nflexibility coupled with mysterious conservation--reveals unrecognized\nconstraints on biological information systems. This paper presents testable\npredictions to distinguish between competing explanations: extreme network\neffects, hidden optimization parameters, or potentially, computational\narchitecture constraints that transcend standard evolutionary pressures.",

With this, we can relate the effective description in JT\ngravity to the CFT$_d$ description at the boundary of AdS$_{d+1}$, which we do\nexplicitly in AdS$_3$ and non-rotating configurations in AdS$_4$. From the\nperspective of the dual CFT, our decoupling limit should be understood as a\nflow between a CFT$_{d}$ and a near-CFT$_1$. Our analysis shows that local\ncounterterms can be constructed in the near-CFT$_1$, which arise from the\nanomalies (or absence of them) in the CFT$_{d}$. We show that one of these\ncounterterms is the Schwarzian effective action, making this sector a\nscheme-dependent choice. This illustrates the delicate interplay between a far\nand a near analysis of near-extremal black holes.",

    "abstract": "We present VISTA (Viewpoint-based Image selection with Semantic Task\nAwareness), an active exploration method for robots to plan informative\ntrajectories that improve 3D map quality in areas most relevant for task\ncompletion. Given an open-vocabulary search instruction (e.g., \"find a\nperson\"), VISTA enables a robot to explore its environment to search for the\nobject of interest, while simultaneously building a real-time semantic 3D\nGaussian Splatting reconstruction of the scene. The robot navigates its\nenvironment by planning receding-horizon trajectories that prioritize semantic\nsimilarity to the query and exploration of unseen regions of the environment.\nTo evaluate trajectories, VISTA introduces a novel, efficient\nviewpoint-semantic coverage metric that quantifies both the geometric view\ndiversity and task relevance in the 3D scene. On static datasets, our coverage\nmetric outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, FisherRF and Bayes' Rays, in\ncomputation speed and reconstruction quality. In quadrotor hardware\nexperiments, VISTA achieves 6x higher success rates in challenging maps,\ncompared to baseline methods, while matching baseline performance in less\nchallenging maps. Lastly, we show that VISTA is platform-agnostic by deploying\nit on a quadrotor drone and a Spot quadruped robot. Open-source code will be\nreleased upon acceptance of the paper.",

    "abstract": "Time-varying group interactions constitute the building blocks of many\ncomplex systems. The framework of temporal hypergraphs makes it possible to\nrepresent them by taking into account the higher-order and temporal nature of\nthe interactions. However, the corresponding datasets are often incomplete\nand/or limited in size and duration, and surrogate time-varying hypergraphs\nable to reproduce their statistical features constitute interesting\nsubstitutions, especially to understand how dynamical processes unfold on group\ninteractions. Here, we present a new temporal hypergraph model, the Emerging\nActivity Temporal Hypergraph (EATH), which can be fed by parameters measured in\na dataset and create synthetic datasets with similar properties. In the model,\neach node has an independent underlying activity dynamic and the overall system\nactivity emerges from the nodes dynamics, with temporal group interactions\nresulting from both the activity of the nodes and memory mechanisms. We first\nshow that the EATH model can generate surrogate hypergraphs of several\nempirical datasets of face-to-face interactions, mimicking temporal and\ntopological properties at the node and hyperedge level. We also showcase the\npossibility to use the resulting synthetic data in simulations of higher-order\ncontagion dynamics, comparing the outcome of such process on original and\nsurrogate datasets. Finally, we illustrate the flexibility of the model, which\ncan generate synthetic hypergraphs with tunable properties: as an example, we\ngenerate \"hybrid\" temporal hypergraphs, which mix properties of different\nempirical datasets. Our work opens several perspectives, from the generation of\nsynthetic realistic hypergraphs describing contexts where data collection is\ndifficult to a deeper understanding of dynamical processes on temporal\nhypergraphs.",

For example, metal organic\ndeposition (MOD) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) produce high-quality\nsuperconducting films with uncorrelated versus correlated disorder,\nrespectively. Here, we study vortex dynamics in PLD-grown EuBa2Cu3Oy films\ncontaining varying concentrations of BaHfO3 inclusions and compare our results\nwith those of MOD-grown (Y,Gd)Ba2Cu3Oy films. Despite both systems exhibiting\nbehavior consistent with strong pinning theory, which predicts the critical\ncurrent density J_c based on vortex trapping by randomly distributed spherical\ninclusions, we find striking differences in the vortex dynamics owing to the\ncorrelated versus uncorrelated disorder. Specifically, we find that the\nEuBa2Cu3Oy films grown without inclusions exhibit surprisingly slow vortex\ncreep, comparable to the slowest creep rates achieved in (Y,Gd)Ba2Cu3Oy films\ncontaining high concentrations of BaHfO3. Whereas adding inclusions to\n(Y,Gd)Ba2Cu3Oy is effective in slowing creep, BaHfO3 increases creep in\nEuBa2Cu3Oy even while concomitantly improving J_c.

In evaluating the\nviolation of the baryon-number conservation during the reheating epoch, in a\nperfectly homogeneous and isotropic universe, we follow a semiclassical\napproach, where $\\theta$, $\\phi$ and gravity are considered as classical\nfields, whereas the fermions are quantized. We solve the equations of motion\nfor the inflaton and spectator fields, respectively at first and zero-order in\nperturbation theory, neglecting at first stage the expansion of the universe.\nAfterwards, we quantify how the spectator field modifies the inflationary\ndynamics and thus find the baryon asymmetry produced via the inflaton decays\ninto fermion-antifermion pairs by computing the corresponding decay amplitudes.\nWe therefore obtain small first order correction to standard spontaneous\nbaryogenesis and finally discuss the mass-mixing between fermions. Accordingly,\nthe effects of considering the universe expansion are accounted, showing when\nthe coupling between $\\phi$ and $R$ becomes noticeable in altering the overall\nbaryon asymmetry.",

    "abstract": "Current control strategies for powered lower limb prostheses often lack\nawareness of the environment and the user's intended interactions with it. This\nlimitation becomes particularly apparent in complex terrains. Obstacle\nnegotiation, a critical scenario exemplifying such challenges, requires both\nreal-time perception of obstacle geometry and responsiveness to user intention\nabout when and where to step over or onto, to dynamically adjust swing\ntrajectories. We propose a novel control strategy that fuses environmental\nawareness and human cooperativeness: an on-board depth camera detects obstacles\nahead of swing phase, prompting an elevated early-swing trajectory to ensure\nclearance, while late-swing control defers to natural biomechanical cues from\nthe user. This approach enables intuitive stepping strategies without requiring\nunnatural movement patterns. Experiments with three non-amputee participants\ndemonstrated 100 percent success across more than 150 step-overs and 30\nstep-ons with randomly placed obstacles of varying heights (4-16 cm) and\ndistances (15-70 cm). By effectively addressing obstacle navigation -- a\ngateway challenge for complex terrain mobility -- our system demonstrates\nadaptability to both environmental constraints and user intentions, with\npromising applications across diverse locomotion scenarios.",

Our\nmethod stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a\nLevel-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the\nrelevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with\nSequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a\nlightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to\nsupport real-time streaming and rendering.

    "abstract": "High-cadence microlensing observations uncovered a population of very\nshort-timescale microlensing events, which are believed to be caused by the\npopulation of free-floating planets (FFP) roaming the Milky Way. Unfortunately,\nthe light curves of such events are indistinguishable from those caused by\nwide-orbit planets. To properly differentiate both cases, one needs\nhigh-resolution observations that would allow resolving a putative luminous\ncompanion to the lens long before or after the event. Usually, the baseline\nbetween the event and high-resolution observations needs to be quite long\n($\\sim 10$ yr), hindering potential follow-up efforts. However, there is a\nchance to use archival data if they exist. Here, we present an analysis of the\nmicrolensing event OGLE-2023-BLG-0524, the site of which was captured in 1997\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Hence, we achieve a record-breaking\nbaseline length of 25 years. A very short duration of the event ($t_E = 0.346\n\\pm 0.008$ d) indicates an FFP as the explanation. We have not detected any\npotential companion to the lens with the HST data, which is consistent with the\nFFP origin of the event. Thanks to the available HST data, we are able to\nreject from 25% to 48% of potential stellar companions depending on the assumed\npopulation model. Based on the finite-source effects in the light curve we\nmeasure the angular Einstein radius value $\\theta_E = 4.78 \\pm 0.23 \\mu as$,\nsuggesting a super-Earth in the Galactic disk or a sub-Saturn-mass planet in\nthe Galactic bulge. We show that the archival high-resolution images should be\navailable for several microlensing events, providing us with the unprecedented\npossibility of seeing the lensing system as it was many years before the event.",

Because most of the global\nminima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly\nPlatonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six\nways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence\nof the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of\nprogressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated\nphenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the\ntheory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent \"entropic\nforces\" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in\nrepresentation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive and avoid\nlengthy technical details.",

Directly estimating the\nescape fraction (fesc) of ionizing photons in the epoch of reionization (EoR)\nis impossible, due to the opacity of the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, a\nhigh fesc leaves clear imprints in the spectrum of a galaxy, due to reduced\nnebular line and continuum emission, which also leads to bluer UV continuum\nslopes (betaUV). Here, we exploit the large archive of deep JWST/NIRSpec\nspectra from the DAWN JWST Archive to analyze over 1'400 galaxies at 5 < zspec\n< 10 and constrain their fesc based on SED fitting enhanced with a picket fence\nmodel. We identify 71 high-confidence sources with significant fesc based on\nBayes factor analysis strongly favouring fesc > 0 over fesc = 0 solutions. We\ncompare the characteristics of this high-escape subset against both the parent\nsample and established diagnostics including betaUV slope, O32, and SFR surface\ndensity (SigmaSFR). For the overall sample, we find that most sources have a\nlow escape fraction (<1%), however, a small subset of sources seems to emit a\nlarge number of their ionizing photons into the IGM, such that the average fesc\nis found to be ~10%, as needed for galaxies to drive reionization. Although\nuncertainties remain regarding recent burstiness and the intrinsic stellar\nionizing photon output at low metallicities, our results demonstrate the unique\ncapability of JWST/NIRSpec to identify individual LyC leakers, measure average\nfesc and thus constrain the drivers of cosmic reionization.",

    "abstract": "Cosmography is a widely applied method to infer kinematics of the Universe at\nsmall cosmological scales while remaining agnostic about the theory of gravity\nat play. Usually cosmologists invoke the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker\n(FLRW) metric in cosmographic analyses, however generalised approaches allow\nfor analyses outside of any assumed geometrical model. These methods have great\npromise to be able to model-independently map the cosmic neighborhood where the\nUniverse has not yet converged to isotropy. In this regime, anisotropies can\nbias parameter inferences if they are not accounted for, and thus must be\nincluded for precision cosmology analyses, even when the principle aim is to\ninfer the background cosmology. In this paper, we develop a method to predict\nthe dipole in luminosity distances that arises due to nearby inhomogeneities.\nThis is the leading-order correction to the standard isotropic\ndistance-redshift law. Within a very broad class of general-relativistic\nuniverse models, we provide an interpretation of the dipole in terms of the\ngradients in expansion rate and density which is free from any underlying\nbackground cosmology. We use numerical relativity simulations, with improved\ninitial data methods, alongside fully relativistic ray tracing to test the\npower of our prediction. We find our prediction accurately captures the dipole\nsignature in our simulations to within ~10% for redshifts $z\\lesssim 0.07$ in\nreasonably smooth simulations. In the presence of more non-linear density\nfields, we find this reduces to $z\\lesssim 0.02$. This represents up to an\norder of magnitude improvement with respect to what is achieved by naive, local\ncosmography-based predictions. Our paper thus addresses important issues\nregarding convergence properties of anisotropic cosmographic series expansions\nthat would otherwise limit their applicability to very narrow redshift ranges.",

Wind models that neglect the potential effects of\nstrong magnetic fields and/or rapid rotation of the PNS typically fail to\nachieve the necessary conditions for production of the third $r-$process peak,\nbut robustly produce a limited or weak $r-$process for neutron-rich winds.\nAxisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations of rotating and non-rotating PNS\nwinds with magnetar-strength fields reveal that high entropy material is\nquasi-periodically ejected from the equatorial closed zone of the PNS\nmagnetosphere. Here, we post-process tracer particle trajectories from these\nsimulations using a nuclear reaction network in order to explore the resulting\nnucleosynthesis across a range of PNS magnetic field strengths, rotation rates,\nand neutrino luminosities (cooling phase after core-bounce).

We show that the Coulomb\ngauge Hamiltonian is equivalent to the temporal gauge Hamiltonian when acting\non physical states consisting of fermion and transverse gauge fields. The\nCoulomb gauge Hamiltonian guarantees that the unphysical longitudinal gauge\nfields do not propagate and thus there is no need to impose any constraint. The\nlocal gauge field basis and the canonically conjugate variable basis are\nswapped efficiently using the quantum Fourier transform. We prove that the\nqubit cost to represent physical states and the gate depth for real-time\nsimulation scale polynomially with the lattice size, energy, time, accuracy and\nHamiltonian parameters. We focus on the lattice theory without discussing the\ncontinuum limit or the UV completion of QED.",

Once trained, the tokenizer can be\nseamlessly adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner,\nfrom short-horizon reactive behaviors to long-horizon planning.

To\nvalidate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments in both simulated\nenvironments and on real robotic platforms.

DexWrist is designed to be close to the\nfunctional capabilities of the human wrist and achieves mechanical compliance\nand a greater workspace as compared to existing robotic wrist designs. The\nDexWrist can supercharge policy learning by (i) enabling faster teleoperation\nand therefore making data collection more scalable; (ii) completing tasks in\nfewer steps which reduces trajectory lengths and therefore can ease policy\nlearning; (iii) DexWrist is designed to be torque transparent with easily\nsimulatable kinematics for simulated data collection; and (iv) most importantly\nexpands the workspace of manipulation for approaching highly cluttered scenes\nand tasks.

The duration of eclipse covers only 1% of the orbital period, and the\npartial phases are at least 30 times shorter. Those parameters imply that the\nstar is a detached binary system with a white dwarf seen edge-on. The new\nobject was added to the International Variable Star Index AAVSO VSX as\nGrigoriev 1. Over the 10 million objects in VSX database there are only 188\nvariable stars of EA/WD type. Grigoriev 1 has the longest orbital period out of\nthose.

    "abstract": "Linear attention mechanisms deliver significant advantages for Large Language\nModels (LLMs) by providing linear computational complexity, enabling efficient\nprocessing of ultra-long sequences (e.g., 1M context). However, existing\nSequence Parallelism (SP) methods, essential for distributing these workloads\nacross devices, become the primary bottleneck due to substantial communication\noverhead. In this paper, we introduce ZeCO (Zero Communication Overhead)\nsequence parallelism for linear attention models, a new SP method designed to\novercome these limitations and achieve end-to-end near-linear scalability for\nlong sequence training. For example, training a model with a 1M sequence length\nacross 64 devices using ZeCO takes roughly the same time as training with an\n16k sequence on a single device. At the heart of ZeCO lies All-Scan, a new\ncollective communication primitive. All-Scan provides each SP rank with\nprecisely the initial operator state it requires while maintaining a minimal\ncommunication footprint, effectively eliminating communication overhead.\nTheoretically, we prove the optimaity of ZeCO, showing that it introduces only\nnegligible time and space overhead. Empirically, we compare the communication\ncosts of different sequence parallelism strategies and demonstrate that\nAll-Scan achieves the fastest communication in SP scenarios. Specifically, on\n256 GPUs with an 8M sequence length, ZeCO achieves a 60\\% speedup compared to\nthe current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP method. We believe ZeCO establishes a\nclear path toward efficiently training next-generation LLMs on previously\nintractable sequence lengths.",

We then propose a ghost category extension\nfor standard classifiers that adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model\ngains extra descent directions that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss\nbarriers and enable the optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early\ntraining phase. We show that this extension strictly reduces the approximation\nerror and that after sufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse so\nthat the extended model coincides with the original one and there exists a path\nin the enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase.\nTaken together, these results provide a principled architecture level\nintervention that accelerates early stage trainability while preserving\nasymptotic behavior and simultaneously serves as an architecture-friendly\nregularizer.",

In particular, the paper extends\nexisting results on the analysis of PID-type geometric nonlinear control laws\nto more general higher-order dynamic state-feedback compensators on\n$\\mathrm{SO(3)}$. The candidate Lyapunov function is motivated by quadratic\nLyapunov functions of the form $V(x)=x^{\\top}Px$ typically considered in the\nanalysis of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. The stability analysis is\ncarried out in two steps. In the first step, a sufficient condition is obtained\nfor the positive definiteness of the candidate Lyapunov function, and a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the negative definiteness of the\ncorresponding Lyapunov rate. These conditions ensure that the desired\nequilibrium is almost globally asymptotically stable (AGAS). In the second\nstep, a convex relaxation of the proposed conditions is used to obtain\nsufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).\nOverall, the approach is motivated by the widespread use of LMI-based analysis\nand design tools for LTI systems. To reduce conservatism, matrix gains are\nconsidered for the controller gains as well as the Lyapunov function\ncoefficients. The applicability of the approach to practical problems is\nillustrated by designing and analyzing a 21-state geometric nonlinear attitude\ncontrol law for a multicopter.",

    "abstract": "Generalised charge pumps are topological obstructions to trivialising loops\nin the space of symmetric gapped Hamiltonians. We show that given mild\nconditions on such pumps, the associated loop has high-symmetry points which\nmust be in distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. To further\nelucidate the connection between pumps and SPTs, we focus on closed paths,\n`pivot loops', defined by two Hamiltonians, where the first is unitarily\nevolved by the second `pivot' Hamiltonian. While such pivot loops have been\nstudied as entanglers for SPTs, here we explore their connection to pumps. We\nconstruct families of pivot loops which pump charge for various symmetry\ngroups, often leading to SPT phases -- including dipole SPTs. Intriguingly, we\nfind examples where non-trivial pumps do not lead to genuine SPTs but still\nentangle representation-SPTs (RSPTs). We use the anomaly associated to the\nnon-trivial pump to explain the a priori `unnecessary' criticality between\nthese RSPTs. We also find that particularly nice pivot families form circles in\nHamiltonian space, which we show is equivalent to the Hamiltonians satisfying\nthe Dolan-Grady relation -- known from the study of integrable models. This\nadditional structure allows us to derive more powerful constraints on the phase\ndiagram. Natural examples of such circular loops arise from pivoting with the\nOnsager-integrable chiral clock models, containing the aforementioned RSPT\nexample. In fact, we show that these Onsager pivots underlie general group\ncohomology-based pumps in one spatial dimension. Finally, we recast the above\nin the language of equivariant families of Hamiltonians and relate the\ninvariants of the pump to the candidate SPTs. We also highlight how certain\nSPTs arise in cases where the equivariant family is labelled by spaces that are\nnot manifolds.",

    "abstract": "Learning high-quality text representations is fundamental to a wide range of\nNLP tasks. While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked\nLanguage Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models\npretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as\nencoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation\nbenchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent\nadvantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model\nand data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of\nlarge-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 38\nmodels ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over\n15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM\ngenerally yields better performance across text representation tasks,\nCLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning\nstability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic\ntraining strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal\nperformance under a fixed computational training budget. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that this strategy becomes more appealing when initializing from\nreadily available pretrained CLM models, reducing the computational burden\nneeded to train best-in-class encoder models.

    "abstract": "Spherical density functional theory (DFT) is a reformulation of the classic\ntheorems of DFT, in which the role of the total density of a many-electron\nsystem is replaced by a set of sphericalized densities, constructed by\nspherically-averaging the total electron density about each atomic nucleus. In\nHohenberg-Kohn DFT and its constrained-search generalization, the electron\ndensity suffices to reconstruct the spatial locations and atomic numbers of the\nconstituent atoms, and thus the external potential. However, the original\nproofs of spherical DFT require knowledge of the atomic locations at which each\nsphericalized density originates, in addition to the set of sphericalized\ndensities themselves. In the present work, we utilize formal results from\ngeometric algebra -- in particular, the subfield of distance geometry -- to\nshow that this spatial information is encoded within the ensemble of\nsphericalized densities themselves, and does not require independent\nspecification. Consequently, the set of sphericalized densities uniquely\ndetermines the total external potential of the system, exactly as in\nHohenberg-Kohn DFT. This theoretical result is illustrated through numerical\nexamples for LiF and for glycine, the simplest amino acid. In addition to\nestablishing a sound practical foundation for spherical DFT, the extended\ntheorem provides a rationale for the use of sphericalized atomic basis\ndensities -- rather than orientation-dependent basis functions -- when\ndesigning classical or machine-learned potentials for atomistic simulation.",

First, we consider this\nmodel in the absence of external matter. In the original Jordan frame, we show\nthat the dynamics of space-time is independent of the value of the cosmological\nconstant. We find analytical solutions, which include evolution from a\nradiation dominated-like universe to an exponential expansion, as well as\nevolution that starts with super-Hubble expansion and then relaxes towards an\nexponential expansion of the Universe. We also show that the scalar\nperturbations of this theory are well-behaved in the Jordan frame. Furthermore,\nwe perform the formulation of the corresponding theory in the Einstein frame,\nand analyse the corresponding accelerating solutions. Second, we consider the\nmodel in the presence of matter. We find that the matter does not affect the\nevolution of the universe if minimally coupled to the scalar field. In other\nwords, in the Jordan frame, in order to influence the evolution of the\nspace-time, the matter should be non-minimally coupled to the constrained\nscalar, while it may be minimally coupled to gravity. We show that in this\ncase, the solutions are similar to the free case, and, in addition, allow for\nthe phantom-like equation of state. Finally, we consider the theory in the\nminimal frame, in which the matter is minimally coupled to both gravity and the\nconstrained scalar, and show that among other possibilities, the phantom-like\nequation of state can still be satisfied in this minimal frame.",

On onboard agents, RTMap\nsimultaneously addresses three core challenges in an end-to-end fashion: (1)\nUncertainty-aware positional modeling for HD map elements, (2)\nprobabilistic-aware localization w.r.t. the crowdsourced prior-map, and (3)\nreal-time detection for possible road structural changes. Experiments on\nseveral public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our solid performance on\nboth the prior-aided map quality and the localization accuracy, demonstrating\nour effectiveness of robustly serving downstream prediction and planning\nmodules while gradually improving the accuracy and freshness of the\ncrowdsourced prior-map asynchronously.

    "abstract": "We introduce a decentralised, algorithmic framework for permissionless,\nmulti-strategy capital allocation via tokenised, automated vaults. The system\nis designed to function analogously to a multi-strategy asset management\ncompany, but implemented entirely on-chain through a modular architecture\ncomprising four interacting layers. The first, the capitalisation layer,\ncomposed of vaults that facilitate multi-asset deposits, tokenises investor\nparticipation, and specifies high level risk limits and admissible venues for\ndeployment. The second, the strategy layer, enables the submission of\nstrategies by human developers or autonomous agents, creating a decentralised\nmarketplace governed by a validation mechanism incorporating adversarial and\ngamified elements. The third, the execution layer, operationalises strategy\ndeployment using the host blockchain network's services. The fourth layer, the\nvalidated allocation layer, assesses and allocates capital among validated\nstrategies, dynamically rebalancing toward those exhibiting superior\nrisk-adjusted performance. In the framework, each admitted strategy acts as a\nmanager for the \"fund\", encapsulated in a smart contract vault that issues\ntransferable V-Tokens, conveying fractional ownership of the real-time\nportfolio operated by the vault. The system is designed to be open to\nparticipation by both human and AI agents, who collectively perform the roles\nof capital allocators, strategy developers, and validated allocators. The\nresulting structure is a self-regulating asset management ecosystem capable of\ndecentralised, cooperative optimisation across traditional and digital\nfinancial domains. This framework is facilitated by a host chain network, which\noffers native automation and data oracle services enabling vault entities to\nautonomously operate on-chain, paving the way for being self sufficient in\ndynamic allocation of capital.",

In F|HM stacks\nconsisting of a ferromagnetic layer F and a heavy-metal layer HM, ultrafast\nspin currents are typically triggered by femtosecond optical laser pulses. A\nkey open question is whether the initial step, optical excitation and injection\nof spin currents, can be controlled by tuning the photon energy of the\nfemtosecond pulse. While many theoretical works suggest a marked impact of\nphoton-energy and of highly excited non-thermal electrons, profound\nexperimental evidence is lacking. Here, we use terahertz-emission spectroscopy\nto study TSCs triggered with two different photon energies of 1.5 eV and 3 eV.\nWe study a wide range of magnetic systems covering metallic ferromagnets,\nferrimagnetic insulators, half-metals, as well as systems including tunneling\nbarriers, and rare-earth metallic alloys. We find that variation of the\nexciting photon energy does not change the dynamics and only slightly the\namplitude of the induced TSC in all sample systems.

The definition is\nbased on an experimental truth long known to humans: Whenever one repeats a\ngiven flow, the results will not be the same if the flow is turbulent.\nTurbulent flows are not strictly repeatable. From this basic fact follows a\nmore elaborate truth about turbulent flows: The mean flow obtained by averaging\nthe results of a large number of repetitions is not a natural flow, that is, it\nis a flow that cannot occur naturally in any experiment. The proposed\ndefinition requires some preliminary mathematical notions, which are also\nintroduced in the text: Proximity between functions, the ensemble of\nrealisations, the method of averaging the flows, and the distinct properties of\nrealisations (physical flows) and averages (mean flows). The notion of\nrestricted nonlinearity is introduced and it is demonstrated that laminar flows\ncan only exist in conditions of restricted nonlinearity, whereas turbulent\nflows are a consequence of general nonlinearity. The particular case of\nsteady-state turbulent flow is studied, and an uncertainty is raised about the\nequality of ensemble average and time average. Two solved examples are also\noffered to illustrate the meaning and methods implied by the definitions: The\nvon K\\`arm\\`an vortex street and a laminar flow with imposed white-noise\nperturbation.",

However, prior research has\ndemonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the\ntraining set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding\nself-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for\nsingle-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid\nMamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance\nhave been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel\nhybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and\nfrequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech\nenhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended\n(VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging\nnoise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our\nproposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar\ncomplexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020\nand EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset\nVB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the\ntime- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization\nperformance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and\nfrequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a\nnotable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets.

    "abstract": "Many machine learning tasks can benefit from external knowledge. Large\nknowledge graphs store such knowledge, and embedding methods can be used to\ndistill it into ready-to-use vector representations for downstream\napplications. For this purpose, current models have however two limitations:\nthey are primarily optimized for link prediction, via local contrastive\nlearning, and they struggle to scale to the largest graphs due to GPU memory\nlimits. To address these, we introduce SEPAL: a Scalable Embedding Propagation\nALgorithm for large knowledge graphs designed to produce high-quality\nembeddings for downstream tasks at scale. The key idea of SEPAL is to enforce\nglobal embedding alignment by optimizing embeddings only on a small core of\nentities, and then propagating them to the rest of the graph via message\npassing. We evaluate SEPAL on 7 large-scale knowledge graphs and 46 downstream\nmachine learning tasks. Our results show that SEPAL significantly outperforms\nprevious methods on downstream tasks. In addition, SEPAL scales up its base\nembedding model, enabling fitting huge knowledge graphs on commodity hardware.",

    "abstract": "As social robots increasingly enter dementia care, concerns about deception,\nintentional or not, are gaining attention. Yet, how robotic design cues might\nelicit misleading perceptions in people with dementia, and how these\nperceptions arise, remains insufficiently understood. In this scoping review,\nwe examined 26 empirical studies on interactions between people with dementia\nand physical social robots. We identify four key design cue categories that may\ninfluence deceptive impressions: cues resembling physiological signs (e.g.,\nsimulated breathing), social intentions (e.g., playful movement), familiar\nbeings (e.g., animal-like form and sound), and, to a lesser extent, cues that\nreveal artificiality. Thematic analysis of user responses reveals that people\nwith dementia often attribute biological, social, and mental capacities to\nrobots, dynamically shifting between awareness and illusion. These findings\nunderscore the fluctuating nature of ontological perception in dementia\ncontexts. Existing definitions of robotic deception often rest on philosophical\nor behaviorist premises, but rarely engage with the cognitive mechanisms\ninvolved. We propose an empirically grounded definition: robotic deception\noccurs when Type 1 (automatic, heuristic) processing dominates over Type 2\n(deliberative, analytic) reasoning, leading to misinterpretation of a robot's\nartificial nature. This dual-process perspective highlights the ethical\ncomplexity of social robots in dementia care and calls for design approaches\nthat are not only engaging, but also epistemically respectful.",

Cluster analysis with longitudinal\ndata further allows for clinical representation of groups of subjects with\nsimilar trajectories and identification of unique characteristics, or\nphenotypes, that can be investigated as risk factors or disease outcomes. Some\nof the challenges in estimating these clustered trajectories lie in the\nhandling of observations at inconsistent time intervals and the usability of\nalgorithms across programming languages.\n  Methods: We propose longitudinal trajectory clustering using a k-means\nalgorithm with thin-plate regression splines, implemented across multiple\nplatforms, the R package clustra and corresponding \\SAS macros. The \\SAS macros\naccommodate flexible clustering approaches, and also include visualization of\nthe clusters, and silhouette plots for diagnostic evaluation of the appropriate\ncluster number. The R package, designed in parallel, has similar functionality,\nwith additional multi-core processing and Rand-index-based diagnostics.\n  Results: The package and macros achieve comparable results when applied to an\nexample of simulated blood pressure measurements based on real data from\nVeterans Affairs Healthcare recipients who were initiated on anti-hypertensive\nmedication.\n  Conclusion: The R package clustra and the SAS macros integrate a K-means\nclustering algorithm for longitudinal trajectories that operates with large\nelectronic health record data.

This paper presents a novel machine learning framework\ncapable of detecting and classifying late-T and Y dwarfs, trained entirely on\nsynthetic photometry from atmospheric models. Utilizing grids from the ATMO\n2020 and Sonora Bobcat models, I produce a training dataset over two orders of\nmagnitude larger than any empirical set of >T6 UCDs. Polynomial color relations\nfitted to the model photometry are used to assign spectral types to these\nsynthetic models, which in turn train an ensemble of classifiers to identify\nand classify the spectral type of late UCDs. The model is highly performant\nwhen validating on both synthetic and empirical datasets, verifying catalogs of\nknown UCDs with object classification metrics >99% and an average spectral type\nprecision within 0.35 +/- 0.37 subtypes. Application of the model to a 1.5\ndegree region around Pisces and the UKIDSS UDS field results in the discovery\nof one previously uncatalogued T8.2 candidate, demonstrating the ability of\nthis model-trained approach in discovering faint, late-type UCDs from\nphotometric catalogs.",

Correlation functions provide\na mathematical framework for characterizing these essential dependencies,\nrevealing insights into causality, structure, and hidden patterns within\ncomplex systems. In physical systems with many degrees of freedom, such as\ngases, liquids, and solids, a statistical analysis of these correlations is\nessential. For a field $\\Psi(\\vec{x},t)$ that depends on spatial position\n$\\vec{x}$ and time $t$, it is often necessary to understand the correlation\nwith itself at another position and time $\\Psi(\\vec{x}_0,t_0)$. This specific\nfunction is called the autocorrelation function. In this context, the\nautocorrelation function for order--parameter fluctuations, introduced by\nFisher, provides an important mathematical framework for understanding the\nsecond-order phase transition at equilibrium. However, his analysis is\nrestricted to a Euclidean space of dimension $d$, and an exponent $\\eta$ is\nintroduced to correct the spatial behavior of the correlation function at\n$T=T_c$. In recent work, Lima et al demonstrated that at $T_c$ a fractal\nanalysis is necessary for a complete description of the correlation function.\nIn this study, we investigate the fundamental physics and mathematics\nunderlying phase transitions. In particular, we show that the application of\nmodern fractional differentials allows us to write down an equation for the\ncorrelation function that recovers the correct exponents below the upper\ncritical dimension.

    "abstract": "Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This\nenduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General\nIntelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5,\nDeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal\nfluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by\ntheir reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This\npaper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning\nartificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models,\nand agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations\nof general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent\nmemory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of\nAgentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use\nto enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies,\nincluding information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free\nmethods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence.\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but\nas evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task\ncompletion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone\nbut from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular,\ninteractive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive\nbehavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning,\nand cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge\nthe gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we\nidentify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.",

    "abstract": "Rocky exoplanet characterization has been a top priority for early James Webb\nSpace Telescope (JWST) science operations. Several milestones have been\nachieved, including the most precise rocky planet transmission spectra measured\nto date, and the first detection of thermal emission for rocky worlds below 800\nKelvin. Despite these advances, no atmospheres have been definitively detected.\nSeveral transmission spectra show tentative evidence for molecular absorption\nfeatures, but these hints are marginally significant and the spectra may be\naffected by stellar contamination. Features from many plausible atmospheres,\nincluding those dominated by oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, are below\nthe current noise level. Meanwhile, the emerging picture from thermal emission\nspectra is that the planets have hot daysides, consistent with either a bare\nrock composition or low surface pressure atmospheres (< 10 bar). Higher surface\npressures and high carbon dioxide abundances are generally ruled out, assuming\ncloud-free atmosphere models. The absence of strong CO$_2$ features hints at a\nlimited initial volatile inventory or rapid atmospheric escape during the\nplanets' early lifetimes. Taken together, these results motivate a push towards\nhigher precision data, as well as observations of cooler planets that may be\nmore likely to retain atmospheres. As a goal for future transmission\nspectroscopy, we suggest a \"five scale height challenge,\" to achieve the\nprecision necessary to detect CO$_2$ features in nitrogen-rich atmospheres.\nDetecting rocky planet atmospheres remains challenging, but with JWST's\nexcellent performance and a continuing investment of telescope time, we are\noptimistic these uncharted atmospheres will be detected in coming years.",

While in the Standard Model (SM) these calculations are quite\nadvanced, in many models beyond the SM (BSM) a precise calculation is missing\nso far. We present the calculation of the Higgs-strahlung cross-sections at\n$e^+e^-$ colliders for the light neutral Higgs boson production in the\nNext-to-Minimal Supersymmetric SM (NMSSM) with complex parameters (cNMSSM). The\nevaluation is based on a full one-loop calculation of the production mechanism\n$e^+e^- \\to h_1 Z$, including soft, hard, and collinear photon radiation. The\ndependence of the Higgs boson production cross-sections on the relevant cNMSSM\nparameters is analyzed numerically. In certain scenarios we find sizable\ncorrections to the Higgs-strahlung cross-section. Normally, they reach about\n$10%$ of the tree-level results, but can also exceed 20%. Finally, the\ncalculation is compared to the corresponding one in the Minimal Supersymmetric\nSM (MSSM).

The\nproblem arises naturally in settings where one wishes to explain or enforce a\ngiven solution by minimally perturbing the input.\n  We extend this classical problem by replacing the fixed basis with a subset\n$S_0$ of the ground set and imposing various structural constraints on the set\nof maximum-weight bases relative to $S_0$. Specifically, we study six variants:\n(A) Inverse Matroid Exists, where $S_0$ must contain at least one\nmaximum-weight basis; (B) Inverse Matroid All, where all bases contained in\n$S_0$ are maximum-weight; and (C) Inverse Matroid Only, where $S_0$ contains\nexactly the maximum-weight bases, along with their natural negated\ncounterparts.\n  For all variants, we develop combinatorial polynomial-time algorithms under\nthe $\\ell_\\infty$-norm. A key ingredient is a refined min-max theorem for\nInverse Matroid under the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm, which enables simpler and faster\nalgorithms than previous approaches and may be of independent combinatorial\ninterest.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed\nmachine learning, enabling collaborative training of a global model across\nmultiple local devices without requiring them to share raw data. Despite its\nadvancements, FL is limited by factors such as: (i) privacy risks arising from\nthe unprotected transmission of local model updates to the fusion center (FC)\nand (ii) decreased learning utility caused by heterogeneity in model\nquantization resolution across participating devices. Prior work typically\naddresses only one of these challenges because maintaining learning utility\nunder both privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity is a non-trivial task.\nIn this paper, our aim is therefore to improve the learning utility of a\nprivacy-preserving FL that allows clusters of devices with different\nquantization resolutions to participate in each FL round. Specifically, we\nintroduce a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) that is designed to simultaneously\nachieve differential privacy (DP) and minimum quantization error. Notably, the\nproposed SQ guarantees bounded distortion, unlike other DP approaches. To\naddress quantization heterogeneity, we introduce a cluster size optimization\ntechnique combined with a linear fusion approach to enhance model aggregation\naccuracy. Numerical simulations validate the benefits of our approach in terms\nof privacy protection and learning utility compared to the conventional\nLaplaceSQ-FL algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic modes are excited by turbulent convection in the outer convective\nenvelope of solar-like stars. Observational results from asteroseismic studies\nshow that 44% of solar-like stars do not present detectable\nstochastically-excited acoustic modes. This phenomenon appears to be related to\ntheir rotation rate and magnetic activity. In a first paper, we showed that\nuniform rotation tends to diminish the mode amplitudes significantly. However,\nconvective envelopes in solar-type stars are differentially rotating: the\nrotation rate difference between mid-latitudes and the equator can go up to\n60%, as shown by recent asteroseismic works. In this paper, we examine the\nimpact of differential rotation on the stochastic excitation of acoustic modes\nin solar-like stars. We provide theoretical predictions for the excitation of\nacoustic modes in a differentially rotating solar-like star. We use the\nRotating Mixing-Length Theory approach to model the local influence of\ndifferential rotation on convection. We then estimate the resulting impact on\npower injection by turbulent convection into oscillation modes numerically,\nusing a combination of the MESA stellar structure and evolution code and GYRE\nstellar pulsation code. We show that the power injected in acoustic modes\ndiffers by up to 30 % for stars with the same mean rotation rate $5\n\\Omega_{\\odot}$ but a distinct differential rotation rate. The excitation of\naxisymmetric acoustic modes is further inhibited in the anti-solar differential\nrotation regime where the pole of stars rotates faster than their equator when\ncompared to the uniform rotation case. This could hinder mode detection in such\nconfigurations. This study permits a first prediction of the excitation of\nacoustic modes as a function of the differential rotation in solar-like\npulsators.",

The method requires no exact diagonalization or master equation\npropagation, and depends only on measurable parameters: the mean exciton energy\nand its variance, the microcavity dispersion, and the Rabi splitting. Using\nparameters corresponding to recently probed organic microcavities, we show that\nexciton inhomogeneous broadening slows both lower and upper polaritons,\nparticularly when the mean exciton energy fluctuation approaches the collective\nlight-matter coupling strength. A detailed discussion and interpretation of\nthese results is provided using perturbation theory in the limit of weak\nresonance scattering.

Embodied intelligence\nfocuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the\nphysical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only\nadvanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract\ncognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical\nsimulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest.\nPhysical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training\nand evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of\ncomplex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal\nrepresentations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and\nadaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey\nsystematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the\nintegration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their\ncomplementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in\nintelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and\ninternal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world\ndeployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges,\nthis survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more\ncapable and generalizable embodied AI systems.

By decoupling the lifting problem (converting an image to a 3D model\nrepresenting what is visible) from the completion problem (hallucinating\ncontent not present in the input), we create a more deterministic task suitable\nfor discriminative models. Our method employs visibility masks derived from\noptimized 3D Gaussian splats to exclude areas not visible from the source view\nduring training. This masked training strategy significantly improves\nreconstruction quality in visible regions compared to strong baselines.\nNotably, despite being trained only on masked regions, Image2GS remains\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art discriminative models trained on full target\nimages when evaluated on complete scenes.

Second, we\nsurvey the current research landscape from the perspective of agent workflows,\nencompassing urban sensing, memory management, reasoning, execution, and\nlearning. Third, we categorize the application domains of urban LLM agents into\nfive groups: urban planning, transportation, environment, public safety, and\nurban society, presenting representative works in each group. Finally, we\ndiscuss trustworthiness and evaluation issues that are critical for real-world\ndeployment, and identify several open problems for future research.

We refer to such solutions as Sadovskii vortices, in honor of\nthe contribution of Sadovskii [J. Appl. Math. Mech., 1971]. It is often used to\nunderstand how stable flow can arise even in strongly interacting singular\nconfigurations. Typical examples include the Sadovskii vortex patches and the\nChaplygin-Lamb dipole. Our first result concerns the stability of a nonempty\ncollection of Sadovskii vortex patches with prescribed impulse and unique\ntraveling speed. If the initial vorticity is close to one of these patches, the\nvorticity travels at a similar speed while staying close to the class up to a\nshift. As the closest patch and the shift may vary over time due to ignorance\nof the uniqueness of the Sadovskii patches, we carefully selected the class so\nthat any perturbed solution retains its Sadovskii-like structure uniformly in\ntime and travels nearly at the speed of the patches in the class. This result\nis obtained via a concentration-compactness argument and several uniform\nestimates for the associated variational problem, along with a shift function\nestimate, which is optimal, derived by tracking the horizontal center of mass\nof the perturbed solution. Our second result establishes the existence of\nSadovskii vortices with higher regularity, including compactly supported\nsolutions ranging from vortex patches to functions that are nearly $C^3$. Until\nnow, the best-known regularity for such vortices was merely Lipschitz\ncontinuity of the classical Chaplygin-Lamb dipole, and our result goes beyond\nthis. We also establish their corresponding Lyapunov stability. These are\nachieved by formulating and solving a family of variational problems that\nextend the recent framework developed for the Chaplygin-Lamb dipole and\nSadovskii patches.",

This paper presents the first field\ndemonstration, in collaboration with major corporate partners, of a\nsoftware-only approach--Emerald Conductor--that transforms AI data centers into\nflexible grid resources that can efficiently and immediately harness existing\npower systems without massive infrastructure buildout. Conducted at a 256-GPU\ncluster running representative AI workloads within a commercial, hyperscale\ncloud data center in Phoenix, Arizona, the trial achieved a 25% reduction in\ncluster power usage for three hours during peak grid events while maintaining\nAI quality of service (QoS) guarantees. By orchestrating AI workloads based on\nreal-time grid signals without hardware modifications or energy storage, this\nplatform reimagines data centers as grid-interactive assets that enhance grid\nreliability, advance affordability, and accelerate AI's development.",

    "abstract": "Imaginary-time evolution is fundamental to analyzing quantum many-body\nsystems, yet classical simulation requires exponentially growing resources in\nboth system size and evolution time. While quantum approaches reduce the\nsystem-size scaling, existing methods rely on heuristic techniques with\nmeasurement precision or success probability that deteriorates as evolution\ntime increases. We present a quantum algorithm that prepares normalized\nimaginary-time evolved states using an adaptive normalization factor to\nmaintain stable success probability over large imaginary times. Our algorithm\napproximates the target state to polynomially small errors in inverse imaginary\ntime using polynomially many elementary quantum gates and a single ancilla\nqubit, achieving success probability close to one. When the initial state has\nreasonable overlap with the ground state, this algorithm also achieves\npolynomial resource complexity in the system size. We extend this approach to\nground-state preparation and ground-state energy estimation, achieving reduced\ncircuit depth compared to existing methods. Numerical experiments validate our\ntheoretical results for evolution time up to 50, demonstrating the algorithm's\neffectiveness for long-time evolution and its potential applications for early\nfault-tolerant quantum computing.",

We consider two key\ndiffusion mechanisms: (i) interstitial diffusion under non-equilibrium\nconditions relevant to ion implantation, and (ii) trap-limited diffusion (TLD)\nunder near-equilibrium thermal annealing conditions. Our results reveal a\nstrong diffusion anisotropy along the b and c axes, with dopant behavior\ngoverned by competition between diffusion and incorporation (or dissociation)\nactivation energies. Under interstitial diffusion, Ca$^{2+}_{\\text{i}}$ and\nMg$^{2+}_{\\text{i}}$ show the most favorable combination of low migration and\nincorporation barriers, making them promising candidates for efficient doping\nalong the b and c axes, respectively. In contrast, Au$^{+}_{\\text{i}}$ diffuses\nreadily, but exhibits an incorporation barrier that exceeds 5 eV, rendering it\nineffective as a dopant. From a thermal stability perspective,\nCo$^{2+}_{\\text{i}}$ shows poor activation but high diffusion barriers, which\nmay suppress undesirable migration at elevated temperatures. Under trap-limited\ndiffusion, the dissociation of dopant-host complexes controls mobility.\nMg$^{2+}_{\\text{i}}$ again emerges as a leading candidate, exhibiting the\nlowest dissociation barriers along both axes, whereas Co$^{2+}_{\\text{i}}$ and\nFe$^{2+}_{\\text{i}}$ display the highest barriers, suggesting improved dopant\nretention under thermal stress.

Simulations are carried out using the multi-stage JETSCAPE\nframework tuned to describe the quenching of jets and hadrons. Isolated\nnon-prompt photons are generated in hard photon bremsstrahlung, where the\nphoton is radiated at a sufficient angle to the jet. Several photon triggered\njet and jet substructure observables show significant contributions from\ninclusive photons, yielding an improvement in comparison with experimental\ndata. Novel photon triggered jet substructure observables are also expected to\nshow new structures, yet to be detected in experiment. This effort examines the\nsignificance of isolated non-prompt photons using parameters tuned for a\nsimultaneous description of the leading hadron and jet spectrum, and thus\nprovides an independent verification of the multistage evolution framework.",

Materials & Methods T1 and T2\nmaps were manually segmented. The test subset was independently annotated by\ntwo observers, and inter-observer variability was assessed.

However, the challenge of managing DS2D connectivity\nfor multi-constellations becomes outstanding, including high interference and\nfrequent handovers caused by multi-coverage overlap and rapid satellite\nmovement. Moreover, existing approaches primarily operate within\nsingle-constellation shell, which inherently limits the ability to exploit the\nvast potential of multi-constellation connectivity provision, resulting in\nsuboptimal DS2D service performances. To address these challenges, this article\nproposes a Constellation as a Service (CaaS) framework, which treats the entire\nmulti-constellation infrastructure as a shared resource pool and dynamically\nforms optimal sub-constellations (SCs) for each DS2D service region. The\nformation of each SC integrates satellites from various orbits to provide\ntailored connectivity based on user demands, guided by two innovative\nstrategies: predictive satellite beamforming using generative artificial\nintelligence (GenAI) and pre-configured handover path for efficient satellite\naccess and mobility management.

    "abstract": "Reliable detection of surrounding objects is critical for the safe operation\nof connected automated vehicles (CAVs). However, inherent limitations such as\nthe restricted perception range and occlusion effects compromise the\nreliability of single-vehicle perception systems in complex traffic\nenvironments. Collaborative perception has emerged as a promising approach by\nfusing sensor data from surrounding CAVs with diverse viewpoints, thereby\nimproving environmental awareness. Although collaborative perception holds\ngreat promise, its performance is bottlenecked by wireless communication\nconstraints, as unreliable and bandwidth-limited channels hinder the\ntransmission of sensor data necessary for real-time perception. To address\nthese challenges, this paper proposes SComCP, a novel task-oriented semantic\ncommunication framework for collaborative perception. Specifically, SComCP\nintegrates an importance-aware feature selection network that selects and\ntransmits semantic features most relevant to the perception task, significantly\nreducing communication overhead without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, we\ndesign a semantic codec network based on a joint source and channel coding\n(JSCC) architecture, which enables bidirectional transformation between\nsemantic features and noise-tolerant channel symbols, thereby ensuring stable\nperception under adverse wireless conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed framework. In particular, compared to\nexisting approaches, SComCP can maintain superior perception performance across\nvarious channel conditions, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nscenarios. In addition, SComCP exhibits strong generalization capability,\nenabling the framework to maintain high performance across diverse channel\nconditions, even when trained with a specific channel model.",

    "abstract": "The Kaplan-Meier estimate, also known as the product-limit method (PLM), is a\nwidely used non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) in survival\nanalysis. In the context of highway engineering, it has been repeatedly applied\nto estimate stochastic traffic flow capacity. However, this paper demonstrates\nthat PLM is fundamentally unsuitable for this purpose. The method implicitly\nassumes continuous exposure to failure risk over time - a premise invalid for\ntraffic flow, where intensity does not increase linearly, and capacity is not\neven directly observable. Although parametric MLE approach offers a viable\nalternative, its earlier derivation for this use case suffers from flawed\nlikelihood formulation, likely due to attempt to preserve consistency with PLM.\nThis study derives a corrected likelihood formula for stochastic capacity MLE\nand validates it using two empirical datasets. The proposed method is then\napplied in a case study examining the effect of a variable speed limit (VSL)\nsystem used for traffic flow speed harmonisation at a 2-to-1 lane drop. Results\nshow that the VSL improved capacity by approximately 10 % or reduced breakdown\nprobability at the same flow intensity by up to 50 %.

    "abstract": "We study nonparametric regression under covariate shift with structured data,\nwhere a small amount of labeled target data is supplemented by a large labeled\nsource dataset. In many real-world settings, the covariates in the target\ndomain lie near a low-dimensional manifold within the support of the source,\ne.g., personalized handwritten digits (target) within a large, high-dimensional\nimage repository (source). Since density ratios may not exist in these\nsettings, standard transfer learning techniques often fail to leverage such\nstructure. This necessitates the development of methods that exploit both the\nsize of the source dataset and the structured nature of the target.\n  Motivated by this, we establish new minimax rates under covariate shift for\nestimating a regression function in a general H\\\"older class, assuming the\ntarget distribution lies near -- but not exactly on -- a smooth submanifold of\nthe source. General smoothness helps reduce the curse of dimensionality when\nthe target function is highly regular, while approximate manifolds capture\nrealistic, noisy data. We identify a phase transition in the minimax rate of\nestimation governed by the distance to the manifold, source and target sample\nsizes, function smoothness, and intrinsic versus ambient dimensions. We propose\na local polynomial regression estimator that achieves optimal rates on either\nside of the phase transition boundary. Additionally, we construct a fully\nadaptive procedure that adjusts to unknown smoothness and intrinsic dimension,\nand attains nearly optimal rates. Our results unify and extend key threads in\ncovariate shift, manifold learning, and adaptive nonparametric inference.",

One flight occurred\nduring the Gannon storm May 10 and 11, 2024 and one flight occurred during\nquiet geomagnetic conditions June 8 and 9, 2025. The flight results validated\nthe strategy during extreme space weather, i.e., apply operational controls for\nshielding to reduce dose.

Both ALARA shielding methods are controllable in\nairline operations and air traffic management.

    "abstract": "Accurate traversability estimation is essential for safe and effective\nnavigation of outdoor robots operating in complex environments. This paper\nintroduces a novel experience-based method that allows robots to autonomously\nlearn which terrains are traversable based on prior navigation experience,\nwithout relying on extensive pre-labeled datasets. The approach integrates\nelevation and texture data into multi-layered grid maps, which are processed\nusing a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained on a generic texture dataset.\nDuring an initial teleoperated phase, the robot collects sensory data while\nmoving around the environment. These experiences are encoded into compact\nfeature vectors and clustered using the BIRCH algorithm to represent\ntraversable terrain areas efficiently. In deployment, the robot compares new\nterrain patches to its learned feature clusters to assess traversability in\nreal time. The proposed method does not require training with data from the\ntargeted scenarios, generalizes across diverse surfaces and platforms, and\ndynamically adapts as new terrains are encountered. Extensive evaluations on\nboth synthetic benchmarks and real-world scenarios with wheeled and legged\nrobots demonstrate its effectiveness, robustness, and superior adaptability\ncompared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

Population III.1 stars, forming in\npristine, dense dark matter (DM) minihalos, are compelling progenitors. This\nstudy presents a suite of stellar evolution models for accreting Pop III.1\nprotostars, calculated with the \\textsc{GENEC} code. We systematically explore\na wide parameter space, spanning ambient WIMP densities of $\\rho_\\chi \\sim\n10^{12}\\mbox{-}10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{GeV\\,cm^{-3}}$ and gas accretion rates of\n$10^{-3}\\mbox{-}10^{-1}\\,M_\\odot\\,\\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, to quantify the effects of\nDM annihilation. A central finding is that for a protostar to grow to\nsupermassive scales ($\\gtrsim 10^5 \\, M_{\\odot}$), the ambient DM density in\nthe immediate vicinity of the star must exceed a critical threshold of\n$\\rho_{\\chi} \\gtrsim 5 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{GeV cm}^{-3}$. The energy\ninjected by WIMP annihilation inflates the protostar, lowering its surface\ntemperature, which suppresses the ionizing feedback that would otherwise halt\naccretion and significantly delays the onset of hydrogen fusion. This heating\nalso governs the star's final fate: in dense halos ($\\rho_\\chi \\gtrsim\n10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{GeV\\,cm^{-3}}$), stars remain stable against general\nrelativistic instability beyond $10^6 \\, M_{\\odot}$, whereas at lower densities\n($\\rho_\\chi \\lesssim 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{GeV\\,cm^{-3}}$), they collapse at masses\nof $\\sim 5 \\times 10^5 \\, M_{\\odot}$. Once the DM fuel is exhausted and core\nburning commences, the protostar contracts and its ionising photon output can\nreach very high levels $\\sim 10^{53} s^{-1}$.

Traditional approaches include template fitting and machine\nlearning, each with distinct strengths and limitations. We present a hybrid\nmethod that integrates template fitting with deep learning using physics-guided\nneural networks. By embedding spectral energy distribution templates into the\nnetwork architecture, our model encodes physical priors into the training\nprocess. The system employs a multimodal design, incorporating cross-attention\nmechanisms to fuse photometric and image data, along with Bayesian layers for\nuncertainty estimation. We evaluate our model on the publicly available PREML\ndataset, which includes approximately 400,000 galaxies from the Hyper\nSuprime-Cam PDR3 release, with 5-band photometry, multi-band imaging, and\nspectroscopic redshifts. Our approach achieves an RMS error of 0.0507, a\n3-sigma catastrophic outlier rate of 0.13%, and a bias of 0.0028. The model\nsatisfies two of the three LSST photometric redshift requirements for redshifts\nbelow 3.

Here, we present $^{75}$As\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on the multiband superconductor\nKFe$_2$As$_2$.

Effective forecasting allows\nfor the precise application of anti-sprouting chemicals (ASCs), minimizing\nwaste and reducing costs. This need has become even more pressing following the\nban on Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC) or Chlorpropham due to\nhealth and environmental concerns, which has led to the adoption of\nsignificantly more expensive alternative ASCs. Existing approaches primarily\nrely on visual identification, which only detects sprouting after morphological\nchanges have occurred, limiting their effectiveness for proactive management. A\nreliable early prediction method is therefore essential to enable timely\nintervention and improve the efficiency of post-harvest storage strategies,\nwhere early refers to detecting sprouting before any visible signs appear. In\nthis work, we address the problem of early prediction of potato sprouting. To\nthis end, we propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach that enables\nearly prediction of potato sprouting using electrophysiological signals\nrecorded from tubers using proprietary sensors. Our approach preprocesses the\nrecorded signals, extracts relevant features from the wavelet domain, and\ntrains supervised ML models for early sprouting detection. Additionally, we\nincorporate uncertainty quantification techniques to enhance predictions.\nExperimental results demonstrate promising performance in the early detection\nof potato sprouting by accurately predicting the exact day of sprouting for a\nsubset of potatoes and while showing acceptable average error across all\npotatoes.

    "abstract": "Flexible manufacturing systems in Industry 4.0 require robots capable of\nhandling objects in unstructured environments without rigid positioning\nconstraints. This paper presents a computer vision system that enables\nindustrial robots to detect and grasp pen components in arbitrary orientations\nwithout requiring structured trays, while maintaining robust performance under\nvarying lighting conditions. We implement and evaluate a Mask R-CNN-based\napproach on a complete pen manufacturing line at ZHAW, addressing three\ncritical challenges: object detection without positional constraints,\nrobustness to extreme lighting variations, and reliable performance with\ncost-effective cameras. Our system achieves 95% detection accuracy across\ndiverse lighting conditions while eliminating the need for structured component\nplacement, demonstrating a 30% reduction in setup time and significant\nimprovement in manufacturing flexibility. The approach is validated through\nextensive testing under four distinct lighting scenarios, showing practical\napplicability for real-world industrial deployment.",

For instance,\nthe demand of items is impacted by the prices set, and online checkout choices\nare influenced by the assortments presented. The challenge in decision-making\nunder this setting is the lack of counterfactual information, and the need to\nlearn it instead. We introduce an end-to-end method under endogenous\nuncertainty to train ML models to be aware of their downstream, enabling their\neffective use in the decision-making stage. We further introduce a robust\noptimization variant that accounts for uncertainty in ML models -- specifically\nby constructing uncertainty sets over the space of ML models and optimizing\nactions to protect against worst-case predictions. We prove guarantees that\nthis robust approach can capture near-optimal decisions with high probability\nas a function of data. Besides this, we also introduce a new class of two-stage\nstochastic optimization problems to the end-to-end learning framework that can\nnow be addressed through our framework. Here, the first stage is an\ninformation-gathering problem to decide which random variable to poll and gain\ninformation about before making a second-stage decision based off of it. We\npresent several computational experiments for pricing and inventory\nassortment/recommendation problems. We compare against existing methods in\nonline learning/bandits/offline reinforcement learning and show our approach\nhas consistent improved performance over these. Just as in the endogenous\nsetting, the model's prediction also depends on the first-stage decision made.\nWhile this decision does not affect the random variable in this setting, it\ndoes affect the correct point forecast that should be made.",

These challenges highlight the necessity for a robust and efficient\nmultimodal UAV object detection method. Mamba has demonstrated considerable\npotential in multimodal image fusion. Leveraging this, we propose UAVD-Mamba, a\nmultimodal UAV object detection framework based on Mamba architectures. To\nimprove geometric adaptability, we propose the Deformable Token Mamba Block\n(DTMB) to generate deformable tokens by incorporating adaptive patches from\ndeformable convolutions alongside normal patches from normal convolutions,\nwhich serve as the inputs to the Mamba Block. To optimize the multimodal\nfeature complementarity, we design two separate DTMBs for the RGB and infrared\n(IR) modalities, with the outputs from both DTMBs integrated into the Mamba\nBlock for feature extraction and into the Fusion Mamba Block for feature\nfusion. Additionally, to improve multiscale object detection, especially for\nsmall objects, we stack four DTMBs at different scales to produce multiscale\nfeature representations, which are then sent to the Detection Neck for Mamba\n(DNM). The DNM module, inspired by the YOLO series, includes modifications to\nthe SPPF and C3K2 of YOLOv11 to better handle the multiscale features. In\nparticular, we employ cross-enhanced spatial attention before the DTMB and\ncross-channel attention after the Fusion Mamba Block to extract more\ndiscriminative features. Experimental results on the DroneVehicle dataset show\nthat our method outperforms the baseline OAFA method by 3.6% in the mAP metric.\nCodes will be released at https://github.com/GreatPlum-hnu/UAVD-Mamba.git.",

In this work, we\nexplore the use of Echo Top Height (ETH), a 2D projection indicating the\nmaximum altitude of radar reflectivity above a given threshold, as an auxiliary\ninput variable for deep learning-based nowcasting.

Ice formation, in particular, is affected by the\nevolution of physical conditions, which can lead to different ice compositions\nwithin the same cloud. In cold cores with medium densities >1e4 cm-3, low\ntemperatures <15 K, and low UV radiation <G0, most COMs are formed on dust\ngrain surfaces and are released back into the gas phase through non-thermal\nmechanisms. Studying both gas- and solid-phases can help observers to add\nconstraints on the chemical and dynamical evolution of cold cores. We present a\nstudy of the cold core L694, observed with the IRAM 30m telescope. Observed\nspecies include CO (and its isotopologues) and CH3OH. We applied an inverted\nnon-LTE radiative transfer code in order to obtain gas-phase abundances by\nderiving the column densities of the detected species from the spectroscopic\nparameters of the targeted molecular transitions, and from physical parameters\nderived from archival observations. This allowed us to probe the molecular\nabundances as a function of density and visual extinction. In parallel, we ran\nchemical models (both static and dynamic) to constrain the evolution time of\nthe core by directly comparing the observations with the model outputs. We then\ncompared the compositions of the cold cores L429-C and L694. The gas-phase\nabundances in L694 all exhibit a common depletion profile (with high\nvariability in the depletion factor), as the core is identified to be in a more\nadvanced (infalling) state compared to L429-C. The physical parameters of the\ntwo cores are, however, very similar, leading to close evolutionary timescales\nin our static models. The dynamical model fails to reproduce the CO gas-phase\nabundances at high density, predicting an evolutionary timescale that is too\nshort compared to static models.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic graph storage systems are essential for real-time applications such\nas social networks and recommendation, where graph data continuously evolves.\nHowever, they face significant challenges in efficiently handling concurrent\nread and write operations. We find that existing methods suffer from write\nqueries interfering with read efficiency, substantial time and space overhead\ndue to per-edge versioning, and an inability to balance performance, such as\nslow searches under concurrent workloads. To address these issues, we propose\nRapidStore, a holistic approach for efficient in-memory dynamic graph storage\ndesigned for read-intensive workloads. Our key idea is to exploit the\ncharacteristics of graph queries through a decoupled system design that\nseparates the management of read and write queries and decouples version data\nfrom graph data. Particularly, we design an efficient dynamic graph store to\ncooperate with the graph concurrency control mechanism. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that RapidStore enables fast and scalable concurrent graph queries,\neffectively balancing the performance of inserts, searches, and scans, and\nsignificantly improving efficiency in dynamic graph storage systems.",

    "abstract": "The paper explores stylometry as a method to distinguish between texts\ncreated by Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, addressing issues of model\nattribution, intellectual property, and ethical AI use. Stylometry has been\nused extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts.\nBy applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing\npatterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia,\nwith (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs\n(GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text\nsummarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods\n(Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models\n(decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and\nn-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical,\ngrammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results\nreached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the\nmulticlass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary\nclassification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up\nto .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed\nfeatures characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused\nwords, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to\nhuman-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the\nincreasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine-\nfrom human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type.",

We employed an automated, anatomy-based,\nheuristic-learning hybrid artery-vein segmentation post-processing method to\nfurther reduce FPs. Methods: Two DL models, CPM-Net and a deformable 3D\nconvolutional neural network-transformer hybrid (3D-CNN-TR), were trained with\n1,186 open-source CTAs (1,373 annotated aneurysms), and evaluated with 143\nheld-out private CTAs (218 annotated aneurysms). Brain, artery, vein, and\ncavernous venous sinus (CVS) segmentation masks were applied to remove possible\nFPs in the DL outputs that overlapped with: (1) brain mask; (2) vein mask; (3)\nvein more than artery masks; (4) brain plus vein mask; (5) brain plus vein more\nthan artery masks. Results: CPM-Net yielded 139 true-positives (TP); 79\nfalse-negative (FN); 126 FP. 3D-CNN-TR yielded 179 TP; 39 FN; 182 FP. FPs were\ncommonly extracranial (CPM-Net 27.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 42.3%), venous (CPM-Net 56.3%;\n3D-CNN-TR 29.1%), arterial (CPM-Net 11.9%; 3D-CNN-TR 53.3%), and non-vascular\n(CPM-Net 25.4%; 3D-CNN-TR 9.3%) structures. Method 5 performed best, reducing\nCPM-Net FP by 70.6% (89/126) and 3D-CNN-TR FP by 51.6% (94/182), without\nreducing TP, lowering the FP/case rate from 0.88 to 0.26 for CPM-NET, and from\n1.27 to 0.62 for the 3D-CNN-TR.

We integrate DLRs into a multi-period DC optimal power flow\nproblem, with chance constrains addressing correlated uncertainty in DLRs and\nrenewable generation. This yields non-convex problems that we transform into a\ntractable convex form by linearization. We derive locational marginal energy\nand ancillary services prices consistent with a competitive equilibrium.\nNumerical experiments on the 11-zone and 1814-node NYISO systems demonstrate\nits performance, including impacts on dispatch, pricing, and marginal carbon\nemissions.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-based Object Detection (UAV-OD) faces substantial\nchallenges, including small target sizes, high-density distributions, and\ncluttered backgrounds in UAV imagery. Current algorithms often depend on\nhand-crafted components like anchor boxes, which demand fine-tuning and exhibit\nlimited generalization, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), which is\nthreshold-sensitive and prone to misclassifying dense objects. These generic\narchitectures thus struggle to adapt to aerial imaging characteristics,\nresulting in performance limitations. Moreover, emerging end-to-end frameworks\nhave yet to effectively mitigate these aerial-specific challenges.To address\nthese issues, we propose HEGS-DETR, a comprehensively enhanced, real-time\nDetection Transformer framework tailored for UAVs. First, we introduce the\nHigh-Frequency Enhanced Semantics Network (HFESNet) as a novel backbone.\nHFESNet preserves critical high-frequency spatial details to extract robust\nsemantic features, thereby improving discriminative capability for small and\noccluded targets in complex backgrounds. Second, our Efficient Small Object\nPyramid (ESOP) strategy strategically fuses high-resolution feature maps with\nminimal computational overhead, significantly boosting small object detection.\nFinally, the proposed Selective Query Recollection (SQR) and Geometry-Aware\nPositional Encoding (GAPE) modules enhance the detector's decoder stability and\nlocalization accuracy, effectively optimizing bounding boxes and providing\nexplicit spatial priors for dense scenes. Experiments on the VisDrone dataset\ndemonstrate that HEGS-DETR achieves a 5.1% AP50 and 3.8% AP increase over the\nbaseline, while maintaining real-time speed and reducing parameter count by 4M.",

We study whether a similar\ndynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on\nwell-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where\nmodels reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn\ndiscussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must\ndecide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all\nmodels found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than\nindividually, similar to human experiments.

While this iterative\nfeedback-based refinement process is important in actual recordings, it has\nbeen overlooked in text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). As a result, fine-grained\nstyle refinement after the initial synthesis is not possible, even though the\nsynthesized speech often deviates from the user's intended style.

In this paper we propose a way\nto induce ferroelectricity in silicon dioxide (SiO2), which is still the most\nwidely used dielectric material in silicon-based chips. We show\nfirst-principles evidence that the intercalation of NH3 molecules into\ncrystalline SiO2 is exothermic, where NH3 molecules form quasi-bonds with SiO2,\ngiving rise to large and robust polarizations. In general, such polarization\ncan be reversed via the reformation of N-Si bondings, which is multiaxial so\nvertical ferroelectricity may emerge in their thin-films of any facets. When\nthe applied external electric field is large enough, however, the system may\nexhibit unconventional quantized ferroelectricity of unprecedented magnitude,\nwhere NH3 may migrate for multiple lattice constants like mobile ions in ion\nconductors. Compared with ion conductors with charged mobile ions and ion\nvacancies that may lead to current leakage, herein the intercalated systems can\nbe denoted as neutral ion conductors where both pristine SiO2 and SiO2 filled\nwith NH3 are insulating. Similar ferroelectricity may exist in various SiO2\ncrystalline polymorphs, its amorphous phase, and other porous structures\nintercalated by NH3.

The spectra of eight giants were obtained from the Himalayan\nChandra Telescope, and for the rest of the program stars the spectral data were\ncollected from various public archives. Our detailed abundance analyses of the\nprogram stars involve the determination of stellar parameters and abundances\nfor about 20 elements among the key abundances of He, Li, C, N, O and the\n12C/13C ratios. The difference in the Mg-abundance derived from Mg I lines and\nthe MgH band, and the difference in carbon abundance from C I and the CH-band,\nare used as a clue to the mild hydrogen-deficiency/helium-enhancement. From\nthis analysis, four red giants, an early-AGB star and a supergiant star were\nfound to be enhanced in helium. All these He-enhanced stars are also found to\nbe super Li-rich except for the supergiant. Since the He-rich red giants are\nLi-rich as well, this implies, that He-enrichment is accompanied by\nLi-enrichment but not vice-versa. This is the first spectroscopic measurement\nof photospheric He-abundance in normal and Li-rich field giants. The\nLi-enrichment is observed across the giant branch from RGB-bump (KIC 9821622)\nto AGB phase, unlike that expected from the RGB-tip to RC-phase. A plausible\nscenario for the enrichment of He and as well as Li in giants is the fresh\nsynthesis of Li in the interiors of giants and dredging up along with He to the\nsurface, from deeper layers. However, there could be multiple scenarios\noperating in tandem. This analysis of He- and Li-enrichment along with other\nkey elements provides more insights to decipher the mystery of Li-enrichment in\ngiants.",

The inner planet likely orbits\nclose enough to its host to power magnetic star-planet interactions. In the\nradio domain, magnetic star-planet interaction is expected to produce a unique\nsignature: electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME), beamed in phase with the\norbit of the close-in planet.\n  We conducted the longest radio monitoring campaign of a G dwarf host star to\ndate to search for ECME, totaling $135\\,$h on HIP 67522 over a period of five\nmonths with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) between $1.1-3.1$GHz.\n  We find that HIP 67522 is active in the radio, with emission that varies\nstochastically, with a duty cycle of $69\\%$ above $0.24$mJy, and frequent\nbursts. Both the bursts and the quiescent emission are consistent with the\ncanonical G\\\"udel-Benz relation, and show a positive spectral index and\nbrightness temperatures $\\geq 10^{10}$K, indicating likely a flaring origin.\nOur observations cover $61\\%$ of the innermost planet's orbit, including\nmultiple visits of the quadrature where planet-induced ECME detection is most\nlikely for this system. However, no orbital modulation or persistent\npolarization of the radio emission was detected. Our upper limit on circularly\npolarized emission from HIP 67522 suggests a $<0.7\\%$ conversion efficiency of\nthe magnetic power generated in the star-planet interaction into radio waves,\nunless the emission was missed by our phase or frequency coverage, or was\nabsorbed in the circumstellar plasma. HIP 67522 is a system with one of the\nhighest expected powers of star-planet interaction among known systems and\nshows strong indication of planet-induced flaring, motivating observations at\nother wavelengths to probe for further dissipation pathways.",

Here, we report\nthe first detection of planet-induced flares on HIP 67522, a 17\nmillion-year-old G dwarf star with two known close-in planets. Combining\nspace-borne photometry from TESS and dedicated CHEOPS observations over a span\nof 5 years, we find that the 15 flares in HIP 67522 cluster near the innermost\nplanet's transit phase, indicating persistent magnetic star-planet interaction\nin the system. The stability of interaction implies that the innermost planet\nis continuously self-inflicting a six time higher flare rate than it would\nexperience without interaction. The subsequent flux of energetic radiation and\nparticles bombarding HIP 67522 b may explain the planet's remarkably extended\natmosphere, recently detected with the James Webb Space Telescope.

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to review the use of GenAI in scientometrics, and to\nbegin a debate on the broader implications for the field. First, we provide an\nintroduction on GenAI's generative and probabilistic nature as rooted in\ndistributional linguistics. And we relate this to the debate on the extent to\nwhich GenAI might be able to mimic human 'reasoning'. Second, we leverage this\ndistinction for a critical engagement with recent experiments using GenAI in\nscientometrics, including topic labelling, the analysis of citation contexts,\npredictive applications, scholars' profiling, and research assessment. GenAI\nshows promise in tasks where language generation dominates, such as labelling,\nbut faces limitations in tasks that require stable semantics, pragmatic\nreasoning, or structured domain knowledge. However, these results might become\nquickly outdated. Our recommendation is, therefore, to always strive to\nsystematically compare the performance of different GenAI models for specific\ntasks. Third, we inquire whether, by generating large amounts of scientific\nlanguage, GenAI might have a fundamental impact on our field by affecting\ntextual characteristics used to measure science, such as authors, words, and\nreferences. We argue that careful empirical work and theoretical reflection\nwill be essential to remain capable of interpreting the evolving patterns of\nknowledge production.",

However, due to the subtle features of\nmicro-lesions and their susceptibility to background interference, ex-isting\ndetection methods still face many challenges in terms of accuracy and\nrobustness. To address these issues, a lightweight and high-precision detection\nmodel based on the improved YOLOv8n, named YOLO-KFG, is proposed. Firstly, a\nnew dynamic convolution KWConv and C2f-KW module are designed to improve the\nbackbone network, enhancing the model's ability to perceive micro-lesions.\nSecondly, a fea-ture-focused diffusion pyramid network FDPN is designed to\nfully integrate multi-scale context information, further improving the model's\nability to perceive micro-lesions. Finally, a lightweight shared detection head\nGSDHead is designed to reduce the model's parameter count, making it more\ndeployable on re-source-constrained devices. Experimental results show that\ncompared with the base model YOLOv8n, the improved model reduces the parameter\ncount by 20.7%, increases mAP@0.5 by 4.1%, and improves the recall rate by\n7.9%. Compared with single-stage mainstream algorithms such as YOLOv5n and\nYOLOv10n, YOLO-KFG demonstrates significant advantages in both detection\naccuracy and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Bounce-averaged theories provide a framework for simulating relatively slow\nprocesses, such as collisional transport and quasilinear diffusion, by\naveraging these processes over the fast periodic motions of a particle on a\nclosed orbit. This procedure dramatically increases the characteristic\ntimescale and reduces the dimensionality of the modeled system. The natural\ncoordinates for such calculations are the constants of motion (COM) of the fast\nparticle motion, which by definition do not change during an orbit. However,\nfor sufficiently complicated fields -- particularly in the presence of local\nmaxima of the electric potential and magnetic field -- the COM are not\nsufficient to specify the particle trajectory. In such cases, multiple domains\nin COM space must be used to solve the problem, with boundary conditions\nenforced between the domains to ensure continuity and particle conservation.\nPreviously, these domains have been imposed by hand, or by recognizing local\nmaxima in the fields, limiting the flexibility of bounce-averaged simulations.\nHere, we present a general set of conditions for identifying consistent domains\nand the boundary condition connections between the domains, allowing the\napplication of bounce-averaged theories in arbitrarily complicated and\ndynamically-evolving electromagnetic field geometries. We also show how the\nconnections between the domains can be represented by a directed graph, which\ncan help to succinctly represent the trajectory bifurcation structure.",

By comparing the evaporation\nbehavior of two droplets placed side-by-side with that of an isolated droplet,\nwe find that droplets in the two-drop system evaporate more slowly due to the\nvapor shielding effect, which increases vapor concentration between the\ndroplets. This leads to asymmetric evaporation and longer lifetimes,\nparticularly at room temperature compared to higher temperatures. At room\ntemperature, the isolated droplet primarily follows a constant contact angle\n(CCA) mode, with occasional stick-slip events. The two-drop system\npredominantly exhibits CCA mode for most of its lifetime, with mixed-mode\nevaporation and some stick-slip behavior. At elevated temperatures, the\nisolated droplet maintains a nearly constant contact angle for the first half\nof its lifetime, transitioning to a mixed evaporation mode with occasional\nstick-slip events. In contrast, the two-drop system follows a mixed evaporation\nmode throughout, with occasional stick-slip behavior. Furthermore, a\ncomprehensive theoretical model that accounts for diffusion, evaporative\ncooling, and convection accurately captures the evaporation dynamics of sessile\ndroplets on a superhydrophobic substrate in both isolated and paired\nconfigurations at elevated substrate temperatures.

These planets are hypothesized to form beyond the snow line,\naccreting large amounts of H$_2$O (>10 wt%) before migrating inward. However,\ncurrent interior models often neglect chemical equilibration between primordial\natmospheres and molten interiors. Here, we compute global chemical equilibrium\nstates for a synthetic population of sub-Neptunes with magma oceans. Although\nmany initially accrete 5-30 wt% water, interior-atmosphere interactions destroy\nmost of it, reducing final H$_2$O mass fractions to below 1.5 wt%. As a result,\nnone meet the threshold for Hycean planets. Despite that, we find\nH$_2$O-dominated atmospheres exclusively on planets that accreted the least\nice. These planets form inside the snow line, are depleted in carbon and\nhydrogen, and develop small envelopes with envelope mass fractions below 1%,\ndominated by endogenic water. In contrast, planets formed beyond the snow line\naccrete more volatiles, but their water is largely converted to H$_2$ gas or\nsequestered into the interior, resulting in low atmospheric H$_2$O mass\nfractions. Most H$_2$O-rich envelopes are also fully miscible with H$_2$,\nmaking a separate water layer unlikely. Our results topple the conventional\nlink between ice accretion and water-rich atmospheres, showing instead that\nH$_2$O-dominated envelopes emerge through chemical equilibration in\nhydrogen-poor planets formed inside the snow line.",

In this study, the airflow rate is varied by keeping the fuel flow rates\nconstant, corresponding to the Reynolds number range of 8000-19000 and a fixed\nthermal power of 16 kW. Acoustic pressure in the combustion chamber, high-speed\nOH$^*$, CH$^*$ chemiluminescence images, high-speed particle image velocimetry,\nand steady exhaust gas temperature are measured for scrutiny. The combustor\nshows non-monotonic variations in the acoustic pressure amplitude for both\nfuels. A wider operating envelope and relatively large amplitude acoustic\nfluctuations are observed for the methane-hydrogen mixture compared with pure\nmethane. Both methane and methane-hydrogen mixtures exhibit a linear increase\nin dominant instability frequencies with airflow, indicating the ITA-driven\ncombustion instability. A low-order network model is developed that\nincorporates a simple $n-\\tau$ flame response. It reproduces the observed\ndominant instability frequency by taking in the convective time delay from the\nexperiments that substantiates the ITA-driven instability. Spatio-temporally\nresolved flame and flow dynamics show periodic axisymmetric vortex shedding\nfrom the outer shear layer and its subsequent interaction with CRZ during large\namplitude acoustic oscillations.

Direct\nfusion often fails to fully exploit the LLM's potential and suffers from\nunstable finetuning. As a result, LLM blocks are kept frozen while only the\nvision components are learned. As a remedy to these challenges, we introduce\nLanguage-Unlocked Vision Transformers (LUViT), a novel approach that bridges\nthis modality mismatch through a synergistic pre-training strategy. LUViT\nco-adapts a ViT backbone and an LLM fusion block by (1) employing Masked\nAuto-Encoding (MAE) to pre-train the ViT for richer visual representations, and\n(2) concurrently training Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers within the LLM\nblock using the MAE objective. This joint optimization guides the ViT to\nproduce LLM-aligned features and the LLM to effectively interpret visual\ninformation. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that LUViT\nsignificantly improves performance on various downstream vision tasks,\nshowcasing a more effective and efficient pathway to harness LLM knowledge for\nvisual understanding.",

    "abstract": "A bombardment of comets is thought to have occurred in the inner solar system\nas a result of a dynamical instability among the giant planets after gas disk\ndispersal. Vesta, the second largest asteroid in the main asteroid belt, likely\ndifferentiated before gas disk dispersal, implying its crust witnessed the\ncometary bombardment. The composition of HED meteorites, which represent\nfragments of Vesta's crust, could therefore have been altered by cometary\nimpacts. Here we combine noble gas mass spectrometry measurements, N-body\nsimulations, collision rate calculations, and impact simulations to estimate\nthe cometary contribution to Vesta. While our dynamical simulations indicate\nthat Vesta likely underwent a significant number of collisions with large\ncomets, we find no xenon cometary signature in HED meteorites. This apparent\ncontradiction arises due to the fact that cometary impacts were at high speeds\nand Vesta's weak gravitational attraction made it incapable of retaining\ncometary material. Smaller asteroids are even less likely to retain such\nmaterial. Therefore, if a cometary xenon signature is ever detected in an\nasteroid belt object, it must have been acquired during formation, within the\nsame source region as comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and have been implanted\nlater into the asteroid belt.",

However, the inherent noise\nin both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to\nover-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To\naddress this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that\nintegrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g.,\n30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation.\nOur framework introduces three key contributions.

Second, a temporal graph fusion\nmodule that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via\nhierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions\ninherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation\ntechnique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training\nexamples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in\npredictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts.\n  Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for\nhuman-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation\naccuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.",

To address these challenges, we adopt a\nReinforcement Learning (RL) based post-training strategy to improve the\nreasoning of MLLMs in multi-image grounding tasks.

Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, yielding improvements of +9.04%\non MIG-Bench, +6.37% on MC-Bench, and +4.98% on several out-of-domain reasoning\ngrounding benchmarks compared to the SFT baseline.

However, for high-dimensional slow-fast dynamical systems, the regression\nproblem becomes simultaneously computationally intractable and ill-conditioned.\nAlthough, in principle, modeling only the dynamics evolving on the underlying\nslow manifold addresses both of these challenges, the truncated fast variables\nhave to be compensated by including higher-order nonlinearities as candidate\nterms for the model, leading to an explosive growth in the size of the SINDy\nlibrary. In this work, we develop a SINDy variant that is able to robustly and\nefficiently identify slow-fast dynamics in two steps: (i) identify the slow\nmanifold, that is, an algebraic equation for the fast variables as functions of\nthe slow ones, and (ii) learn a model for the dynamics of the slow variables\nrestricted to the manifold. Critically, the equation learned in (i) is\nleveraged to build a manifold-informed function library for (ii) that contains\nonly essential higher-order nonlinearites as candidate terms. Rather than\ncontaining all monomials of up to a certain degree, the resulting custom\nlibrary is a sparse subset of the latter that is tailored to the specific\nproblem at hand. The approach is demonstrated on numerical examples of a\nsnap-through buckling beam and the flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil. We find that\nour method significantly reduces both the condition number and the size of the\nSINDy library, thus enabling accurate identification of the dynamics on slow\nmanifolds.",

Upon arrival, each mass\nundergoes a relaxation phase during which it is dispersed, possibly also at\nrandom. This process can model many physical phenomena, such as the diffusion\nof liquid in a porous medium. In the discrete case, it can model parking\n(related to additive coalescence and hashing with linear probing) in which the\ncars are permitted to follow random displacement policies.\n  The dispersion policies considered in the paper ensure that at time $k$,\nafter the successive dispersions of $m_0,\\cdots,m_{k-1}$, the total covered\nregion has Lebesgue measure $m_0+\\cdots+m_{k-1}$. Furthermore, during the\ndispersion of a given mass, the covered domain increases continuously, except\nwhen it merges with another covered connected component (CC).\n  We show a very general exchangeability property for the sequence of covered\nCC. Additionally, we demonstrate a universal spacing property between these CC,\nand a notable general result: if the $(u_i)$ are independent and rotationally\ninvariant, then the number of free (not covered) CC follows a binomial\ndistribution whose parameters depend solely on the number and total mass of\narrived particles. Furthermore, conditional on the number of CC, the sizes of\nthe free CC follow a simple Dirichlet distribution in the continuous case,\nregardless of the dispersion policy considered and the values of the masses. We\nalso characterize the distribution of the occupied space.\n  In the second part of the paper, we study the total cost associated with\nthese models for various cost models, and establish connections with the\nadditive coalescent.

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen growing interest in Question Difficulty Estimation\n(QDE) using natural language processing techniques. Question difficulty is\noften represented using discrete levels, framing the task as ordinal regression\ndue to the inherent ordering from easiest to hardest. However, the literature\nhas neglected the ordinal nature of the task, relying on classification or\ndiscretized regression models, with specialized ordinal regression methods\nremaining unexplored. Furthermore, evaluation metrics are tightly coupled to\nthe modeling paradigm, hindering cross-study comparability. While some metrics\nfail to account for the ordinal structure of difficulty levels, none adequately\naddress class imbalance, resulting in biased performance assessments. This\nstudy addresses these limitations by benchmarking three types of model outputs\n-- discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression -- using the\nbalanced Discrete Ranked Probability Score (DRPS), a novel metric that jointly\ncaptures ordinality and class imbalance. In addition to using popular ordinal\nregression methods, we propose OrderedLogitNN, extending the ordered logit\nmodel from econometrics to neural networks. We fine-tune BERT on the RACE++ and\nARC datasets and find that OrderedLogitNN performs considerably better on\ncomplex tasks. The balanced DRPS offers a robust and fair evaluation metric for\ndiscrete-level QDE, providing a principled foundation for future research.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel\nclass of measures of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in ordinal\nclassification, which is based on a suitable reduction to (entropy- and\nvariance-based) measures for the binary case. These measures effectively\ncapture the trade-off in ordinal classification between exact hit-rate and\nminimial error distances.

It is based on non-extensive statistics and characterized by a\nnon-extensivity parameter $q$, which measures the degrees of deviation from the\nthermal equilibrium. We explore the QCD phase transition with $\\mu=0$ MeV in\nthe chiral and non-chiral limit cases, as well as the transition with finite\n$\\mu$ in the non-chiral limit case. It is found that the dimensionless\nthermodynamic quantities such as the entropy density, the pressure, the energy\ndensity, the specific heat at constant volume and the trace anomaly are\nsensitive to the deviation of $q$ from unity and they become large both in the\nhadronic and quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phases with the increase of $q$. In the\nchiral limit case, the sound velocity squared ($(c_s^2)_q$) is insensitive to\nthe deviation. However, in the non-chiral limit case, this deviation leads to\nnontrivial corrections of $(c_s^2)_q$ in the vicinity of the critical point\n($T_c$) and at lower temperatures. Moreover, these dimensionless thermodynamic\nquantities are sensitive to the deviation of $\\mu$ from zero and they become\nlarge both in the hadronic and QGP phases with the increase of $\\mu$. However,\nfor $(c_s^2)_q$, it increases in the vicinity of $T_c$ and decreases at lower\ntemperature. Finally, we observe that our results in the non-chiral limit case\nwith $q=1$ agree well with those from the Lattice QCD, the hadron resonance gas\nmodel, and the Thermal-Fist fit to the hadron yields in high energy nuclear\ncollisions in the low temperature region up to $T\\sim 150$ MeV.",

However, in transmission-based\nmeasurements of thin films on thick substrates, multiple reflections and\nlimited time windows can introduce artifacts that obscure resonant features\nsuch as phonon modes. Time-domain windowing remains one of the most widely\nadopted strategies to mitigate these effects, yet systematic guidelines on its\napplication remain scarce. In this work, we organize a practical routine for\nextracting the complex permittivity from THz-TDS data, focusing on when and how\nto apply time-domain windowing. The routine incorporates decision points for\ntruncation versus smooth apodization, and emphasizes tailoring the window\nlength and shape to specific signal conditions. We demonstrate the approach\nusing representative measurements on PbTe thin films, highlighting cases in\nwhich truncation suffices, where apodization is essential, and how different\nwindow functions and lengths influence the resulting spectra. We also propose\nsimple metrics to assess signal continuity and guide window selection. Although\nother analysis techniques exist, including parametric spectral estimation, this\nstudy focuses on formalizing windowing-based processing into an accessible\nexperimental workflow.

This method of obtaining\nlifetime information involves the design of a testing experiment, i.e., an\naccelerated test plan. In this work, we adopt a simulation-based approach to\nobtaining optimal test plans for constant-stress accelerated life tests with\nmultiple design points. Within this simulation framework we can easily assess a\nvariety of test plans by modifying the number of test stresses (and their\nlevels) and evaluating the allocation of test units. We obtain optimal test\nplans by utilising the differential evolution (DE) optimisation algorithm,\nwhere the inputs to the objective function are the test plan parameters, and\nthe output is the RMSE (root mean squared error) of out-of-sample\n(extrapolated) model predictions. When the life-stress distribution is\ncorrectly specified, we show that the optimal number of stress levels is\nrelated to the number of model parameters. In terms of test unit allocation, we\nshow that the proportion of test units is inversely related to the stress\nlevel. Our general simulation framework provides an alternative approach to\ntheoretical optimisation, and is particularly favourable for large/complex\nmultipoint test plans where analytical optimisation could prove intractable.\nOur procedure can be applied to a broad range of experimental scenarios, and\nserves as a useful tool to aid practitioners seeking to maximise component\nlifetime information through accelerated life testing.",

The\nDynamic String-Averaging Projection (DSAP) algorithm itself was introduced in\nan 2013 paper, where its strong convergence and bounded perturbation resilience\nwere studied in the consistent case (that is, when the sets under consideration\nhad a nonempty intersection). Results involving combination of the DSAP method\nwith superiorization, were presented in 2015.

This is an improvement of the property\nof \"coherence\" of sequences of operators introduced in 2001 by Bauschke and\nCombettes. Strong coherence provides a more convenient sufficient convergence\ncondition for methods that employ infinite sequences of operators and it turns\nout to be a useful general tool when applied to proving the convergence of many\niterative methods. In this paper we combine the ideas of both dynamic\nstring-averaging and strong coherence, in order to analyze our GDSA method for\na general class of operators and its bounded perturbation resilience in the\ninconsistent case with weak and strong convergence.

    "abstract": "Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by\ncapturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their\nsemantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform\nroad-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the\nlimitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute\nlearning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address\nthese issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model\nfor lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces\nthree key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary\npositional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute\nconstraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary\ncoordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary\npositional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information\nwithin queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment\npatterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the\naccuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which\nserves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving.\nOn the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements\nover state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.0%\nmAP in lane segment perception and +1.7% OLS in centerline perception tasks.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nnon-constant inapproximability result known for this problem. We also\nstrengthen the known \\np-hardness of the problem on $2$-apex graphs by showing\nthat the same result holds for $1$-apex graphs. This leaves open the problem of\ndetermining whether the problem remains \\np-hard on planar (i.e., $0$-apex)\ngraphs.\n  On the positive side, we design an algorithm that computes good approximate\nsolutions for hereditary graph classes that admit efficiently computable\nbalanced separators of truly sublinear size. This immediately results in\npolynomial-time approximation algorithms achieving an approximation ratio of\n$O(n^{\\frac{1}{4}} \\sqrt{\\log n})$ on planar graphs, graphs with bounded genus,\nand $k$-apex graphs with $k=O(n^{\\frac{1}{4}})$. On graphs with bounded\ntreewidth, we obtain an approximation ratio of $O(\\log^{3/2} n)$ for any\nconstant $\\varepsilon > 0$. This compares favorably with the best-known\napproximation algorithm for general graphs, which achieves an approximation\nratio of $O(\\sqrt{n \\log n})$ via a simple reduction to the \\textsc{Set Cover}\nproblem.",

While existing deep learning models predominantly\nutilize CYGNSS data with four-channel information, they often adopt\nsingle-channel inputs or simple channel concatenation without leveraging the\nbenefits of cross-channel information interaction during training. To address\nthis limitation, a novel spatial-channel attention-based network, namely\nSCAWaveNet, is proposed for SWH retrieval. Specifically, features from each\nchannel of the DDMs are modeled as independent attention heads, enabling the\nfusion of spatial and channel-wise information. For auxiliary parameters, a\nlightweight attention mechanism is designed to assign weights along the spatial\nand channel dimensions. The final feature integrates both spatial and\nchannel-level characteristics. Model performance is evaluated using\nfour-channel CYGNSS data. When ERA5 is used as a reference, SCAWaveNet achieves\nan average RMSE of 0.438 m. When using buoy data from NDBC, the average RMSE\nreaches 0.432 m. Compared to state-of-the-art models, SCAWaveNet reduces the\naverage RMSE by at least 3.52% on the ERA5 dataset and by 5.68% on the NDBC\nbuoy observations.

In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar\nformulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling\nefficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers\nfrom a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax\nAttention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based\non the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention,\nLinear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query.\nThis prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the\nQuery scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax\nAttention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score\ndistribution.

This adjustment allows MALA to generate an\nattention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while\nexhibiting a more well-balanced structure.

Using the sBBHs\npopulation constraints obtained by the LIGO--Virgo--Kagra collaboration, we\ncompute the expected SGWB and develop a phenomenological parametric model that\ncan accurately capture the effect of dynamical friction and accretion. Using\nour model, we perform Bayesian inference on simulated signals to assess the\ndetectability of these environmental effects. We find that even for large\ninjected values of the Eddington ratio, the effect of accretion in the SGWB is\nundetectable by LISA. However, LISA will be able to constrain the effect of\ndynamical friction with an upper bound on the gas density of $\\rho \\lesssim 7.6\n\\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{g \\, cm^{-3}}$, thus probing the sBBH environment\nforming in typical thin accretion disks around Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs).\nFor injected densities of $\\rho \\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-9} \\mathrm{g} \\,\n\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, dynamical friction effects can be well measured and clearly\ndistinguished from vacuum, with Bayes factors reaching up to $\\sim$ 60, even\nwhen the Galactic foreground is included.",

    "abstract": "The statistical analysis of clinical trials is often complicated by missing\ndata. Patients sometimes experience intercurrent events (ICEs), which usually\n(although not always) lead to missing subsequent outcome measurements for such\nindividuals. The reference-based imputation methods were proposed by Carpenter\net al. (2013) and have been commonly adopted for handling missing data due to\nICEs when estimating treatment policy strategy estimands. Conventionally, the\nvariance for reference-based estimators was obtained using Rubin's rules.\nHowever, Rubin's rules variance estimator is biased compared to the repeated\nsampling variance of the point estimator, due to uncongeniality. Repeated\nsampling variance estimators were proposed as an alternative to variance\nestimation for reference-based estimators. However, these have the property\nthat they decrease as the proportion of ICEs increases. White et al. (2019)\nintroduced a causal model incorporating the concept of a 'maintained treatment\neffect' following the occurrence of ICEs and showed that this causal model\nincluded common reference-based estimators as special cases. Building on this\nframework, we propose introducing a prior distribution for the maintained\neffect parameter to account for uncertainty in this assumption. Our approach\nprovides inference for reference-based estimators that explicitly reflects our\nuncertainty about how much treatment effects are maintained after the\noccurrence of ICEs. In trials where no or little post-ICE data are observed,\nour proposed Bayesian reference-based causal model approach can be used to\nestimate the treatment policy treatment effect, incorporating uncertainty about\nthe reference-based assumption. We compare the frequentist properties of this\napproach with existing reference-based methods through simulations and by\napplication to an antidepressant trial.",

The framework consists of three steps: (i)\ninstructing machines to impersonate each human in the population, reflecting\ntheir backgrounds and beliefs, (ii) administering a questionnaire covering\nvarious philosophical positions to both humans and machines, and (iii)\nstatistically analyzing the resulting responses. We apply this methodology to\nthe debate on scientific realism, a long-standing philosophical inquiry\nexploring the relationship between science and reality. By considering the\noutcome of a survey of over 500 human participants, including both physicists\nand philosophers of science, we generate their machine personas using an\nartificial intelligence engine based on a large-language generative model. We\nreveal that the philosophical views of a population of machines are, on\naverage, similar to those endorsed by a population of humans, irrespective of\nwhether they are physicists or philosophers of science. As compared to humans,\nhowever, machines exhibit a weaker inclination toward scientific realism and a\nstronger coherence in their philosophical positions.

Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a\ncritical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and\npredictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in\nsemiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high\ndata dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,\nnoisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production\nsystems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the\ndelayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly\ndetection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic\napproach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed\nmethodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into\nimage-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)\ndeveloping a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16\narchitecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese\nnetwork composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned\nVGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one\nserving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the\nother as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the\nembeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at\na given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying\nanomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising\nsolution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.\nMoreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and\nsemi-supervised settings.",

Rather than treating speech as a\nmonolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components.\nFirst, we introduce (i) Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification\ntask that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio,\nenabling more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an (ii)\nAudio-Guided Attention module that models the interactions between target\ncandidates and mentioned objects, enhancing discrimination in cluttered 3D\nenvironments. To support benchmarking, we (iii) synthesize audio descriptions\nfor standard 3DVG datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance in audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based\nmethods, highlight the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision\ntasks.",

Hence, including the relevant collective\nvariables is crucial for properly describing spontaneous fission probabilities.\nPairing correlations play an essential role in this evaluation since the\ncollective inertia decreases as the inverse of the square of the pairing gap,\nand, therefore, they should be considered as a relevant degree of freedom on\nthe same footing as deformation parameters.

Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency\nin existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis.

First, we design a\ncross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a\nbi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features.\nThis enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase.\nSecond, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that\nexplores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible.\nTherefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between\nlabeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV\ndataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior\ncross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD:\n1.75mm).

Previous wireframe-alignment-based method\nLoD-Loc has shown promising localization results leveraging LoD models.\nHowever, LoD-Loc mainly relies on high-LoD (LoD3 or LoD2) city models, but the\nmajority of available models and those many countries plan to construct\nnationwide are low-LoD (LoD1). Consequently, enabling localization on low-LoD\ncity models could unlock drones' potential for global urban localization. To\naddress these issues, we introduce LoD-Loc v2, which employs a coarse-to-fine\nstrategy using explicit silhouette alignment to achieve accurate localization\nover low-LoD city models in the air. Specifically, given a query image, LoD-Loc\nv2 first applies a building segmentation network to shape building silhouettes.\nThen, in the coarse pose selection stage, we construct a pose cost volume by\nuniformly sampling pose hypotheses around a prior pose to represent the pose\nprobability distribution. Each cost of the volume measures the degree of\nalignment between the projected and predicted silhouettes. We select the pose\nwith maximum value as the coarse pose. In the fine pose estimation stage, a\nparticle filtering method incorporating a multi-beam tracking approach is used\nto efficiently explore the hypothesis space and obtain the final pose\nestimation. To further facilitate research in this field, we release two\ndatasets with LoD1 city models covering 10.7 km , along with real RGB queries\nand ground-truth pose annotations. Experimental results show that LoD-Loc v2\nimproves estimation accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with\nlow-LoD models for the first time.

The importance of this\nproblem arises as such CT processes represent communications signals, and\nsampling must be applied to facilitate the DT processing associated with their\ncompression. Moreover, the physical characteristics of oscillators imply that\nthe sampling interval is incommensurate with the period of the autocorrelation\nfunction (AF) of the physical process, giving rise to the DT WSACS model\nconsidered. In addition, to reduce the loss, the sampling interval is generally\nshorter than the correlation length, and thus, the DT process is correlated as\nwell. The difficulty in the RDF characterization follows from the\ninformation-instability of WSACS processes, which renders the traditional\ninformation-theoretic tools inapplicable. In this work we utilize the\ninformation-spectrum framework to characterize the RDF when a finite and\nbounded delay is allowed between processing of subsequent source sequences.\nThis scenario extends our previous works which studied settings without\nprocessing delays or without memory.

    "abstract": "The escalating computational costs of Large Language Model (LLM) inference\nhave become a critical barrier to their widespread and sustainable deployment.\nWhile existing optimization strategies are effective, they are predominantly\nbased on statistical heuristics or architectural modifications, lacking a\nguiding cognitive theory to manage the inference process itself. This paper\naims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel paradigm: the Cognitive\nLoad-Aware Inference (CLAI) framework, which operationalizes principles from\nCognitive Load Theory (CLT) and neuroscience for LLM inference. We formalize\nthe concepts of Intrinsic Cognitive Load, Extraneous Cognitive Load, and\nGermane Cognitive Load into quantifiable LLM metrics ($ICL_{LLM}$, $ECL_{LLM}$,\nand $GCL_{LLM}$), thereby reframing the inference process as a cognitive\neconomics optimization problem: based on the intrinsic complexity of a problem\n($ICL_{LLM}$), minimize wasteful computation ($ECL_{LLM}$), and strategically\nallocate the token budget to productive reasoning ($GCL_{LLM}$). We propose two\nimplementation paths: CLAI-Prompt, a zero-shot method that guides a base LLM\nthrough cognitive control steps via a structured meta-prompt, and CLAI-Tune, a\nfine-tuned model that internalizes these principles for spontaneous cognitive\neconomy. Across a range of benchmarks in complex reasoning, long-context\nquestion answering, and code generation, our methods achieve significant\nreductions in token consumption (up to 45\\%) without sacrificing accuracy.\nFurthermore, CLAI-Tune exhibits an emergent ability to autonomously decompose\ndifficult problems, a key characteristic of human expert cognition. This work\ndemonstrates that by emulating the brain's resource management strategies, we\ncan build more efficient, robust, and capable artificial intelligence systems.",

In this work, we utilize the Hopfield model of a\ntwo-mode bosonic system, with each mode interacts with a heat reservoir, to\nresearch the behavior of quantum coherence. Our results indicate that a coupled\noscillator system can exhibit significant quantum coherence in the ultrastrong\nand deep strong coupling regimes. In the ground state, the photon-mode and the\nmatter-mode coherences are equal. The larger coherences that encompass the\nphoton mode, the matter mode, and the overall system are achieved at lower\noptical frequencies and with increased coupling strengths. Notably, the the\nbeam-splitter and phase rotation terms alone does not generate coherences for\neither total coherence or subsystem coherences; instead, the generation of\nquantum coherences originates from the one-mode and two-mode squeezing terms.\nWhen heat environments are present, the total coherence can be enhanced by the\nthe beam-splitter and phase rotation terms, while it has no effect on subsystem\ncoherences. Moreover, when the one-mode and two-mode squeezing terms and the\nthe beam-splitter and phase rotation terms are considered together, the total\ncoherence increases with stronger coupling. We also observe that lower\nfrequencies maximize total coherence in the deep strong coupling regime. These\nresults demonstrate that the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes give\nrise to novel characteristics of quantum coherence. This work provides valuable\ninsights into the quantum coherence properties, particularly in the ultrastrong\nand deep strong coupling regimes between light and matter and may have\npotential applications in quantum information processing.",

We compute magneto-hydrodynamic and purely\nhydrodynamic simulations of G2V, K0V and M2V star. The magnetic simulations are\nstarted from the hydrodynamical ones, adding the Biermann battery term in the\ninduction equation to produce a magnetic seed, that is enhanced by the action\nof the small-scale dynamo. Once the magnetic field is saturated, we compare the\nsimulations with and without magnetic fields and characterize the differences\nin statistics of velocities, appearance of granulation, and the mean\nstratification of a number of relevant parameters. These differences are also\ncompared with the deviations produced by different treatments of the opacity in\nthe simulations. The saturation values of the magnetic fields are $\\sim 100$ G\nfor the three stars in their surface, consistent with the recent results for\ncool stars, and other results for the Sun in the literature. The local magnetic\nfields have a negligible effect on the velocities of the plasma or the mean\nstratifications of the simulated stars. In contrast, they produce changes in\nthe bolometric intensity of the intergranular lanes and the power spectrum at\nsmall scales of the temperature and vertical velocity of downflows. Significant\ndifferences between the hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic simulations are\nalso found for the kinetic energy.

The proposal was initially motivated by the\ndiscovery of a new class of mirror pairs singular Calabi-Yau varieties\narXiv:2003.07148, given by certain branched double covers over toric varieties\nof MPCP type. The overarching problem was to understand these mirror pairs from\nthe viewpoint of homological mirror symmetry arXiv:alg-geom/9411018. In the\npresent paper, we propose two main results along this line. First, one new\ninsight is that the `gauge-fixing' condition on the branching locus of the\ndouble cover used in arXiv:2003.07148 can be relaxed in an interesting way.\nThis turns out to produce GLSMs that describe a much larger class of\nnon-commutative resolutions, leading to $A$-periods for a larger class of\nnon-commutative resolutions, as well as the GKZ systems for their $A$-periods.\nSecond, we show that the $A$-periods can also be realized as $A$-periods of a\ncertain smooth CICY family in a toric variety of MPCP type, such that a\nsuitable finite quotient of this family recovers the double cover CY we have\nstarted with. We call this CICY family the `pre-quotient' of the double cover\nCY. This realization strongly suggests that pre-quotient may provide an\nimportant approach for understanding homological mirror symmetry for singular\ndouble cover CY varieties and non-commutative resolutions.",

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of Extended Reality (XR) applications demands\nsubstantial processing power and high bandwidth communications, often\nunavailable on lightweight devices. Remote rendering consists of offloading\nprocessing tasks to a remote node with a powerful GPU, delivering the rendered\ncontent to the end device. The delivery is usually performed through popular\nstreaming protocols such as Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC), offering a\ndata channel for interactions, or Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH),\nbetter suitable for scalability. Moreover, new streaming protocols based on\nQUIC are emerging as potential replacements for WebRTC and DASH and offer\nbenefits like connection migration, stream multiplexing and multipath delivery.\nThis work describes the integration of the two most popular multimedia\nframeworks, GStreamer and FFmpeg, with a rendering engine acting as a Remote\nRenderer, and analyzes their performance when offering different protocols for\ndelivering the rendered content to the end device over WIFI or 5G.

However, intelligent\nmachines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge\nvolume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques\nand rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive\ndata. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object\npairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the\ndiscriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature\nselection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved\nsamples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory\nability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.\nFirst, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the\ndiscriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set\nwithin an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of\nthe probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature\nsubset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be\nestimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes\nwere used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate\nreducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory\nability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.\nExperiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate\nreduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a\npersonal computer.",

    "abstract": "Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) provides a way to learn\nhigh-performance policies in environments where the reward signal is hard to\nspecify, avoiding heuristic and time-consuming reward design. However, PbRL can\nsuffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward\nmodel. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and\nfine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network,\nusing different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose\nchallenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to\neffectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM). An RRM\nassumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two\nparts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term\navailable before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward\nfunction, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce\nstate-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks\nin the Meta-World environment suite. Experimental results show that our method\nsubstantially improves the performance of a common PbRL method. Our method\nachieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior\nrewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a\nnegated version of the proxy reward. We also conduct experiments with a Franka\nPanda to show that our method leads to superior performance on a real robot. It\nsignificantly accelerates policy learning for different tasks, achieving\nsuccess in fewer steps than the baseline. The videos are presented at\nhttps://sunlighted.github.io/RRM-web/.",

For the best-fit model, the inclination angle,$\\alpha$, and\nthe impact angle, $\\beta$, of this pulsar are $55^{\\circ}.56$ and\n$53^{\\circ}.47$, respectively. Using the rotating magnetosphere approximation\nof the magnetic dipole field, we investigate the three-dimensional pulsar\nmagnetosphere and the sparking pattern on the polar cap surface. Our analysis\nindicates that the extremely narrow zone of the polar cap, which is associated\nwith a high-altitude magnetospheric region, is responsible for the weak\nemission window. This pulsar has extremely high-altitude magnetospheric radio\nemissions.",

    "abstract": "Despite its significant success, object detection in traffic and\ntransportation scenarios requires time-consuming and laborious efforts in\nacquiring high-quality labeled data. Therefore, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\n(UDA) for object detection has recently gained increasing research attention.\nUDA for object detection has been dominated by domain alignment methods, which\nachieve top performance. Recently, self-labeling methods have gained popularity\ndue to their simplicity and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the\nlimitations that prevent self-labeling detectors from achieving commensurate\nperformance with domain alignment methods. Specifically, we identify the high\nproportion of simple samples during training, i.e., the simple-label bias, as\nthe central cause. We propose a novel approach called De-Simplifying Pseudo\nLabels (DeSimPL) to mitigate the issue. DeSimPL utilizes an instance-level\nmemory bank to implement an innovative pseudo label updating strategy. Then,\nadversarial samples are introduced during training to enhance the proportion.\nFurthermore, we propose an adaptive weighted loss to avoid the model suffering\nfrom an abundance of false positive pseudo labels in the late training period.\nExperimental results demonstrate that DeSimPL effectively reduces the\nproportion of simple samples during training, leading to a significant\nperformance improvement for self-labeling detectors. Extensive experiments\nconducted on four benchmarks validate our analysis and conclusions.",

In this paper, we present\nWorld4Drive, an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that employs vision\nfoundation models to build latent world models for generating and evaluating\nmulti-modal planning trajectories. Specifically, World4Drive first extracts\nscene features, including driving intention and world latent representations\nenriched with spatial-semantic priors provided by vision foundation models.

Finally, it introduces a world model selector\nmodule to evaluate and select the best trajectory. We achieve perception\nannotation-free, end-to-end planning through self-supervised alignment between\nactual future observations and predicted observations reconstructed from the\nlatent space.

While cross-attention models achieve\nstrong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic\ncomplexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this\nchallenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures\nthe power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent\npipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving\nmultimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion\nblock built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric\ncross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming\nmodality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit\n(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,\nenabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,\nrecurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it\nideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark\ndemonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex\nbaselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF\ncreates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive\nfusion mechanism.

    "abstract": "Existing program verifiers can prove advanced properties about security\nprotocol implementations, but are difficult to scale to large codebases because\nof the manual effort required. We develop a novel methodology called *Diodon*\nthat addresses this challenge by splitting the codebase into the protocol\nimplementation (the *Core*) and the remainder (the *Application*). This split\nallows us to apply powerful semi-automated verification techniques to the\nsecurity-critical Core, while fully-automatic static analyses scale the\nverification to the entire codebase by ensuring that the Application cannot\ninvalidate the security properties proved for the Core. The static analyses\nachieve that by proving *I/O independence*, i.e., that the I/O operations\nwithin the Application are independent of the Core's security-relevant data\n(such as keys), and that the Application meets the Core's requirements. We have\nproved Diodon sound by first showing that we can safely allow the Application\nto perform I/O independent of the security protocol, and second that manual\nverification and static analyses soundly compose. We evaluate Diodon on two\ncase studies: an implementation of the signed Diffie-Hellman key exchange and a\nlarge (100k+ LoC) production Go codebase implementing a key exchange protocol\nfor which we obtained secrecy and injective agreement guarantees by verifying a\nCore of about 1% of the code with the auto-active program verifier Gobra in\nless than three person months.",

    "abstract": "[Abridged] The physical conditions in stellar atmospheres can be obtained\nfrom the interpretation of solar spectro-polarimetric observations. However,\ntraditional inversion codes are computationally demanding, especially for lines\nwhose formation is complex. The necessity of faster alternatives has motivated\nthe emergence of machine learning solutions. This paper introduces an approach\nto the inversion and synthesis of Stokes profiles inspired by neural machine\ntranslation. Our aim is to develop a generative model that treats Stokes\nprofiles and atmospheric models as two distinct ``languages'' encoding the same\nphysical reality. We build a model that learns how to translate between them,\nalso providing estimates of the uncertainty. We employ a tokenization strategy\nfor both Stokes parameters and model atmospheres, which is learned using a\nVQ-VAE, a neural model used to compress the data into a lower dimensionality\nform. The core of our inversion code utilizes a transformer encoder-decoder\narchitecture to perform the translation between these tokenized\nrepresentations. The model is trained on a database of synthetic Stokes\nprofiles derived from perturbations to various semi-empirical solar atmospheric\nmodels, ensuring a wide range of expected solar physical conditions. The method\neffectively reconstructs atmospheric models from observed Stokes profiles,\nshowing better constrained models within the region of sensitivity of the\nconsidered spectral lines. The latent representation induced by the VQ-VAE\nhelps accelerate the inversion by compressing the length of the Stokes profiles\nand model atmospheres. Additionally, it helps regularize the solution by\nreducing the chances of obtaining unphysical models. As a final advantage, the\nmethod provides the generative nature of our model, which naturally yields an\nestimate of the uncertainty in the solution.",

    "abstract": "Safe overtaking manoeuvres in trucks are vital for preventing accidents and\nensuring efficient traffic flow. Accurate prediction of such manoeuvres is\nessential for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to make timely and\ninformed decisions. In this study, we focus on overtake detection using\nController Area Network (CAN) bus data collected from five in-service trucks\nprovided by the Volvo Group. We evaluate three common classifiers for vehicle\nmanoeuvre detection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM), and analyse how different preprocessing\nconfigurations affect performance. We find that variability in traffic\nconditions strongly influences the signal patterns, particularly in the\nno-overtake class, affecting classification performance if training data lacks\nadequate diversity. Since the data were collected under unconstrained,\nreal-world conditions, class diversity cannot be guaranteed a priori. However,\ntraining with data from multiple vehicles improves generalisation and reduces\ncondition-specific bias. Our pertruck analysis also reveals that classification\naccuracy, especially for overtakes, depends on the amount of training data per\nvehicle. To address this, we apply a score-level fusion strategy, which yields\nthe best per-truck performance across most cases. Overall, we achieve an\naccuracy via fusion of TNR=93% (True Negative Rate) and TPR=86.5% (True\nPositive Rate).

In this work, we employ a trivalent metal cation\ntransmutation strategy to design a series of inorganic Pb-free halide double\nperovskites Cs$_{2}$AgM(III)Cl$_{6}$ and perform a comprehensive investigation\ninto their potential for applications in optoelectronic devices. Our\nfirst-principles calculations, rooted in density functional theory, demonstrate\nthat these materials possess a face-centered cubic lattice structure while\nshowcasing remarkable thermodynamic, dynamical, and mechanical stability. The\nG$_{0}$W$_{0}$@PBE electronic bandgap ranges from 1.47-6.20 eV, while the\nBethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) indicates strong optical absorption spanning\nnear-infrared to ultraviolet regions for these compounds. Furthermore, the\nexcitonic properties suggest that these perovskites exhibit intermediate\nexciton binding energies (0.17 to 0.60 eV) and generally longer exciton\nlifetimes, except for the materials with M(III) = Sc, Y, Tb, and Lu. The\nFr\\\"ohlich model indicates that these materials exhibit intermediate to strong\ncarrier-phonon interactions, with hole-phonon coupling more prominent than\nelectron-phonon coupling.

The method, which can be applied to neutron star - black hole (NSBH)\nmergers as well, is based on simple Poisson statistics and on an estimate of\nthe ratio of the VT span by the future run to that span by previous runs. An\nattractive advantage of this method is that its predictions are independent\nfrom the mass distribution of the merging compact binaries, which is very\nuncertain at the present moment. The results, not surprisingly, show that the\nmost likely outcome of the final part of O4 is the absence of any BNS merger\ndetection. Still, the probability of a non-zero number of detections is\n34-46\\%. For NSBH mergers, the probability of at least one additional detection\nis 64-71\\%. The prospects for the next observing run O5 are more promising,\nwith predicted numbers $N_\\mathrm{BNS,O5}=28_{-21}^{+44}$, and the NSBH\ndetections to be $N_\\mathrm{NSBH,O5}=65_{-38}^{+61}$ (median and 90\\% symmetric\ncredible range), based on the current LVK detector target sensitivities for the\nrun. The calculations presented here also lead to an update of the LVK local\nBNS merger rate density estimate that accounts for the absence of BNS merger\ndetections in O4 so far, that reads $2.8\\,\\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\\,yr^{-1}}\\leq\nR_0\\leq 480\\,\\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\\,yr^{-1}}$.",

    "abstract": "While modern AI continues to advance, the biological brain remains the\npinnacle of neural networks in its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency.\nThis review explores an AI architectural path inspired by the brain's\nstructure, particularly the minicolumn hypothesis, which views the neocortex as\na distributed system of repeated modules - a structure we connect to collective\nintelligence (CI). Despite existing work, there is a lack of comprehensive\nreviews connecting the cortical column to the architectures of repeated neural\nmodules. This review aims to fill that gap by synthesizing historical,\ntheoretical, and methodological perspectives on neural module repetition. We\ndistinguish between architectural repetition - reusing structure - and\nparameter-shared module repetition, where the same functional unit is repeated\nacross a network. The latter exhibits key CI properties such as robustness,\nadaptability, and generalization. Evidence suggests that the repeated module\ntends to converge toward a generalist module: simple, flexible problem solvers\ncapable of handling many roles in the ensemble. This generalist tendency may\noffer solutions to longstanding challenges in modern AI: improved energy\nefficiency during training through simplicity and scalability, and robust\nembodied control via generalization. While empirical results suggest such\nsystems can generalize to out-of-distribution problems, theoretical results are\nstill lacking. Overall, architectures featuring module repetition remain an\nemerging and unexplored architectural strategy, with significant untapped\npotential for both efficiency, robustness, and adaptiveness. We believe that a\nsystem that adopts the benefits of CI, while adhering to architectural and\nfunctional principles of the minicolumns, could challenge the modern AI\nproblems of scalability, energy consumption, and democratization.",

    "abstract": "Deformable medical image registration is traditionally formulated as an\noptimization problem. While classical methods solve this problem iteratively,\nrecent learning-based approaches use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to mimic\nthis process by unrolling the prediction of deformation fields in a fixed\nnumber of steps. However, classical methods typically converge after sufficient\niterations, but learning-based unrolling methods lack a theoretical convergence\nguarantee and show instability empirically. In addition, unrolling methods have\na practical bottleneck at training time: GPU memory usage grows linearly with\nthe unrolling steps due to backpropagation through time (BPTT). To address both\ntheoretical and practical challenges, we propose DEQReg, a novel registration\nframework based on Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ), which formulates registration\nas an equilibrium-seeking problem, establishing a natural connection between\nclassical optimization and learning-based unrolling methods. DEQReg maintains\nconstant memory usage, enabling theoretically unlimited iteration steps.\nThrough extensive evaluation on the public brain MRI and lung CT datasets, we\nshow that DEQReg can achieve competitive registration performance, while\nsubstantially reducing memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art\nunrolling methods. We also reveal an intriguing phenomenon: the performance of\nexisting unrolling methods first increases slightly then degrades irreversibly\nwhen the inference steps go beyond the training configuration. In contrast,\nDEQReg achieves stable convergence with its inbuilt equilibrium-seeking\nmechanism, bridging the gap between classical optimization-based and modern\nlearning-based registration methods.",

A rank-metric\ncode is said to be intersecting if any two nonzero codewords have supports\nintersecting non trivially. We explore this class from both a coding-theoretic\nand geometric perspective, highlighting its relationship with minimal codes,\nMRD codes, and Hamming-metric intersecting codes. We derive structural\nproperties, sufficient conditions based on minimum distance, and geometric\ncharacterizations in terms of 2-spannable $q$-systems.

Previous studies in quantum\ncontrol have shown that, beyond transform-limited pulses, those with\nantisymmetric spectral phases can drive nonresonant multiphoton transitions\nwith comparable efficiency. However, in resonant multiphoton transitions, the\nmaterial's spectral-phase response introduces dispersion that degrades\nnonlinear efficiency. Pre-shaping the pulse to compensate for the material's\nimpulse response can restore and enhance nonlinear interactions beyond the\ntransform-limited case. Yet, is this the only spectral phase that can yield\nsuch enhancement? Here, we study sub-10 fs single-pulse four-wave mixing in\nresonant plasmonic nanostructures using arctangent spectral-phase-shaped\npulses. We uncover two distinct enhancement regimes: one compensating for\nmaterial dispersion, and a counterintuitive regime where the arctangent phase\ninduces an antisymmetric polarization response, driving constructive\nmultiphoton pathway interference. Our theoretical analysis provides clear\nphysical explanation for both phenomena. Notably, it predicts that both\nenhancement mechanisms scale exponentially with harmonic order, offering a\npowerful strategy for dramatically enhancing high-order harmonic generation in\nresonant systems.",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to classify unseen\nskeleton-based human actions without prior exposure to such categories during\ntraining. This task is extremely challenging due to the difficulty in\ngeneralizing from known to unknown actions. Previous studies typically use\ntwo-stage training: pre-training skeleton encoders on seen action categories\nusing cross-entropy loss and then aligning pre-extracted skeleton and text\nfeatures, enabling knowledge transfer to unseen classes through skeleton-text\nalignment and language models' generalization. However, their efficacy is\nhindered by 1) insufficient discrimination for skeleton features, as the fixed\nskeleton encoder fails to capture necessary alignment information for effective\nskeleton-text alignment; 2) the neglect of alignment bias between skeleton and\nunseen text features during testing. To this end, we propose a prototype-guided\nfeature alignment paradigm for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition,\ntermed PGFA. Specifically, we develop an end-to-end cross-modal contrastive\ntraining framework to improve skeleton-text alignment, ensuring sufficient\ndiscrimination for skeleton features. Additionally, we introduce a\nprototype-guided text feature alignment strategy to mitigate the adverse impact\nof the distribution discrepancy during testing. We provide a theoretical\nanalysis to support our prototype-guided text feature alignment strategy and\nempirically evaluate our overall PGFA on three well-known datasets.

We establish the existence and uniqueness of the Nash\nequilibrium in both the finite-player network game and the corresponding\ninfinite-player graphon game.

    "abstract": "Achieving human-like reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) has long been a goal. Current methods primarily focus on\nsynthesizing positive rationales, typically relying on manual annotations or\ncomplex systems. Moreover, they often overlook negative reasoning, which limits\nthe model's generalization ability and robustness in multimodal inference. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel framework: \\textbf{S}elf-Aligning\n\\textbf{M}ultimodal Reasoning with \\textbf{A}nswer-O\\textbf{r}iented\nChain-of-\\textbf{T}hought (SMART). SMART employs an answer-oriented\nchain-of-thought (AoT) prompt to automatically construct high-quality data.\nDrawing inspiration from human proof-based strategies, AoT leverages both\ncorrect and incorrect answers to extract key visual information that links\nquestions and answers. When provided with correct answers, the model produces\nstrong positive rationales. Conversely, when correct answers are replaced with\nincorrect alternatives, the model generates an erroneous yet compelling\nreasoning path, serving as a form of discriminative negative rationale. Models\ntrained with AoT-generated data outperform those trained on manually annotated\ndatasets, demonstrating superior reasoning capabilities. Consequently, SMART\nestablishes an iterative generation-optimization method that continually\nenhances the model's reasoning skills. Experiments indicate that the SMART\nframework significantly improves various MLLMs, regardless of model\narchitecture, parameter size, or pre-training dataset.

    "abstract": "Despite the advancements in quality and efficiency achieved by 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) in 3D scene rendering, aliasing artifacts remain a persistent\nchallenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on low-pass filtering to mitigate\naliasing. However, these methods are not sensitive to the sampling rate, often\nresulting in under-filtering and over-smoothing renderings. To address this\nlimitation, we propose LOD-GS, a Level-of-Detail-sensitive filtering framework\nfor Gaussian Splatting, which dynamically predicts the optimal filtering\nstrength for each 3D Gaussian primitive. Specifically, we introduce a set of\nbasis functions to each Gaussian, which take the sampling rate as input to\nmodel appearance variations, enabling sampling-rate-sensitive filtering. These\nbasis function parameters are jointly optimized with the 3D Gaussian in an\nend-to-end manner. The sampling rate is influenced by both focal length and\ncamera distance. However, existing methods and datasets rely solely on\ndown-sampling to simulate focal length changes for anti-aliasing evaluation,\noverlooking the impact of camera distance. To enable a more comprehensive\nassessment, we introduce a new synthetic dataset featuring objects rendered at\nvarying camera distances.

This process yields a comprehensive\nand semantically rich map, further enhanced by automatically associating\ntextual labels from the CAD source and cohesively merging multiple building\nfloors into a unified, topologically-correct model. By leveraging the permanent\nstructural information inherent in CAD files, our system circumvents the\ninefficiencies and fragility of SLAM, offering a practical and scalable\nsolution for deploying robots in complex indoor spaces.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges of rapid resource variation and highly\nuncertain task loads in cloud computing environments. It proposes an\noptimization method for elastic cloud resource scaling based on a multi-agent\nsystem. The method deploys multiple autonomous agents to perceive resource\nstates in parallel and make local decisions. While maintaining the distributed\nnature of the system, it introduces a collaborative value function to achieve\nglobal coordination. This improves the responsiveness of resource scheduling\nand enhances overall system performance. To strengthen system foresight, a\nlightweight state prediction model is designed. It assists agents in\nidentifying future workload trends and optimizes the selection of scaling\nactions. For policy training, the method adopts a centralized training and\ndecentralized execution reinforcement learning framework. This enables agents\nto learn effectively and coordinate strategies under conditions of incomplete\ninformation. The paper also constructs typical cloud scenarios, including\nmulti-tenancy and burst traffic, to evaluate the proposed method. The\nevaluation focuses on resource isolation, service quality assurance, and\nrobustness. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-agent scaling\nstrategy outperforms existing methods in resource utilization, SLA violation\ncontrol, and scheduling latency. The results demonstrate strong adaptability\nand intelligent regulation.

To this end, we employ a hybrid CR Monte Carlo\n(CR-MC)/molecular dynamics (MD) simulation framework to systematically explore\nthe effects of pH, salt concentration, and polymer chain length on NP surface\ncharge behavior. For comparison, we also conduct MD simulations under constant\ncharge (CC) conditions. Our results reveal that CR enhances PE adsorption onto\nNP surfaces compared to the CC case, where polymer bridging dominates across a\nwide range of NP intersurface separations. This enhanced adsorption under CR\nleads to a weak net repulsion driven by osmotic forces. In contrast, the CC\nmodel yields a stronger net attraction due to the bridging force. Furthermore,\nwe find that the CR effects are more pronounced at a low salt concentration,\nwhereas at a high salt concentration, counterion screening dominates in both CR\nand CC cases, resulting in similar interaction profiles. These findings\nhighlight the importance of incorporating charge regulation in characterizing\nNP interactions within a complex biochemical environment, particularly in the\npresence of low salt concentrations.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a user semantic intent modeling algorithm based on\nCapsule Networks to address the problem of insufficient accuracy in intent\nrecognition for human-computer interaction. The method represents semantic\nfeatures in input text through a vectorized capsule structure. It uses a\ndynamic routing mechanism to transfer information across multiple capsule\nlayers. This helps capture hierarchical relationships and part-whole structures\nbetween semantic entities more effectively. The model uses a convolutional\nfeature extraction module as the low-level encoder. After generating initial\nsemantic capsules, it forms high-level abstract intent representations through\nan iterative routing process. To further enhance performance, a margin-based\nmechanism is introduced into the loss function. This improves the model's\nability to distinguish between intent classes. Experiments are conducted using\na public natural language understanding dataset. Multiple mainstream models are\nused for comparison. Results show that the proposed model outperforms\ntraditional methods and other deep learning structures in terms of accuracy,\nF1-score, and intent detection rate. The study also analyzes the effect of the\nnumber of dynamic routing iterations on model performance. A convergence curve\nof the loss function during training is provided. These results verify the\nstability and effectiveness of the proposed method in semantic modeling.\nOverall, this study presents a new structured modeling approach to improve\nintent recognition under complex semantic conditions.",

To address the\nsubstantial computational demands of DA, the proposed ROM employs\nlow-resolution (LR) techniques to drastically reduce computational costs. This\napproach involves downsampling datasets for DA computations, followed by an\nadvanced reconstruction technique based on low-cost Singular Value\nDecomposition (lcSVD). The lcSVD method, a key innovation in this paper, has\nnever been applied to DA before and offers a highly efficient way to enhance\nresolution with minimal computational resources. Our results demonstrate\nsignificant reductions in both computation time and RAM usage through the LR\ntechniques without compromising the accuracy of the estimations. For instance,\nin a turbulent test case, the LR approach with a compression rate of 15.9 can\nachieve a speed-up of 13.7 and a RAM compression of 90.9% while maintaining a\nlow Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) of 2.6%, compared to 0.8% in the\nhigh-resolution (HR) reference. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of\nthe EnKF in estimating and predicting the state of fluid flow systems based on\nlimited observations and low-fidelity numerical data. This paper highlights the\npotential of the proposed DA method in fluid dynamics applications,\nparticularly for improving computational efficiency in CFD and related fields.\nIts ability to balance accuracy with low computational and memory costs makes\nit suitable for large-scale and real-time applications, such as environmental\nmonitoring or aerospace.",

Since then, a rich variety of algorithmic proposals were\npublished, e.g., on how to acquire individual preferences, how to aggregate\nthem, and how to generate recommendations for groups of users. However, despite\nthe rich literature on the topic, barely any examples of real-world group\nrecommender systems can be found. This lets us question common assumptions in\nacademic research, in particular regarding communication processes in a group\nand how recommendation-supported decisions are made.

We thus call for a reorientation in\nthis research area, leveraging the capabilities of modern Generative AI\nassistants like ChatGPT. Specifically, as one promising future direction, we\nenvision group recommender systems to be systems where human group members\ninteract in a chat and an AI-based group recommendation agent assists the\ndecision-making process in an agentic way.

Previous\nstudies linked rHHG to the 3p -> 3d giant resonance, suggesting a modified\nfour-step model where recolliding electrons are first captured in the\nautoionizing state before recombining into the ground state, potentially\nleading to an emission delay associated with the resonance lifetime. While both\nthe 1D-model and TDDFT reproduce experimental spectra, TDDFT reveals that rHHG\ncounterintuitively originates from spin-down 3p states, while spin-up 3d\nelectrons negligibly contribute. The IPA fails to reproduce rHHG, highlighting\nthe significance of electron correlations. Furthermore, TDDFT revealed a\ncorrelation induced ~480 attosecond time delay, accompanied by a strong phase\nshift across the resonance, potentially explaining earlier RABBIT measurements.\nOur work sheds light on long-standing open questions in rHHG and should advance\nnovel ultrafast spectroscopies of electron correlations and resonances.",

    "abstract": "Interpretable communication is essential for safe and trustworthy autonomous\ndriving, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often operate under\nidealized assumptions and struggle to capture user intent in real-world\nscenarios. Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene\ndescriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs\ncan respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a\nbox-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs\non spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express\nintent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for\nfocused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical\nevaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess\nbasic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for\nbox-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3)\nspatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To\nsupport this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual\nattributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object\ntrajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality\ncontrol through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and\ndifficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity. Our\ncomprehensive evaluation reveals significant limitations in current VLMs when\nqueried about perception questions, highlighting the gap in achieving\nreal-world performance.

One challenge has been that while photoelasticy has been widely\nand successfully used to measure the vector contact forces within dry granular\nsystems, where the particle-particle interactions are solely frictional and\ncompressive in nature, it has seen little development in systems where tensile\nforces are present. The key difficulty has been the inability to distinguish\nbetween compressive and tensile forces, which appear identically within the\nphotoelastic response.\n  Here, we present a novel approach which solves this problem, by an extension\nto the open-source PeGS (Photoelastic Grain Solver) software available at\nhttps://github.com/photoelasticity. Our new implementation divides the\nprocedure of finding vector contact forces into two steps: first evaluating the\nvector contact forces on the non-cohesive particles present in the ensemble,\nfollowed by using an equilibrium constraint to solve for the forces in the\nbonded particles. We find that in the dilute limit, for up to 25% bonded\ndimers, we can solve for all forces since each particle has only one force\nbearing contact that can potentially transmit tensile forces. While the case of\ndimers is an idealised version of cohesive granular ensemble, it provides an\nimportant first step towards experimentally studying the micro-mechanics of\ncohesive granular materials.",

In this\nwork, we propose a modular pipeline for advertisement management in RAG-based\nconversational systems, consisting of an ad-rewriter for seamless ad\nintegration and a robust ad-classifier for detection.

Our evaluation focuses on two\ncore questions: the effectiveness of ad classifiers in detecting diverse ad\nintegration strategies, and the training methods that best support coherent,\nminimally intrusive ad insertion. Experimental results show that our\nad-classifier, trained on synthetic advertisement data inspired by marketing\nstrategies and enhanced through curriculum learning, achieves robust detection\nperformance. Additionally, we demonstrate that classifier-guided optimization,\nthrough both fine-tuning and best-of-N sampling, significantly improves ad\nstealth, enabling more seamless integration.

As the\natmosphere cools, it is modified by gas-phase reactions and condensation. We\ncombine these processes into an open-source Python package built using JAX\ncalled Atmodeller, and perform calculations for planet sizes and conditions\nanalogous to TRAPPIST-1e and K2-18b. For TRAPPIST-1e-like planets, our\nsimulations indicate that CO-dominated atmospheres are prevalent during the\nmagma ocean stage, which, upon isochemical cooling, predominantly evolve into\nCO2-rich atmospheres of a few hundred bar at 280 K. Around 40% of our\nsimulations predict the coexistence of liquid water, graphite, sulfur, and\nammonium chloride-key ingredients for surface habitability. For sub-Neptune gas\ndwarfs, pressures are sufficiently high (few GPa) to deviate the fugacities of\ngases from ideality, thereby drastically enhancing their solubilities. This\nbuffers the total atmospheric pressure to lower values than for the ideal case.\nThese effects conspire to produce CH4-rich sub-Neptune atmospheres for total\npressures exceeding around 3.5 GPa, provided H/C is approximately 100x solar\nand fO2 moderately reducing (3 log10 units below the iron-w\\\"ustite buffer).\nOtherwise, molecular hydrogen remains the predominant species at lower total\npressures and/or higher H/C.

Although recent work\nhas extended this line of research into machine vision, there has been a\nscarcity of studies systematically exploring its perceptual boundaries across\nmultiple tasks and stimulus types, particularly in the current era of rapidly\nadvancing large multimodal models (LMMs), where studying the multifaceted\ncapabilities of models has become a mainstream focus. Moreover, the perceptual\ndefects of LMMs are not investigated thoroughly, resulting in potential\nsecurity issues and suboptimal response efficiency. In this paper, we take an\ninitial attempt and demonstrate that there exist significant visual blind spots\nin current LMMs. To systemically quantify this characteristic, we propose a new\nconcept, {\\bf LMM-JND}, together with its determination pipeline. Targeting\nuncovering the behavior commonalities in HVS-aligned visual perception tasks,\nwe delve into several LMM families and construct a large-scale dataset, named\nVPA-JND, which contains 21.5k reference images with over 489k stimuli across 12\ndistortion types, to facilitate LMM-JND studies. VPA-JND exposes areas where\nstate-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and the InternVL2.5 series, struggle\nwith basic comparison queries and fall significantly short of human-level\nvisual performance. We further explore the effects of vision and language\nbackbones and find a notable correlation between their design philosophy that\nmay instruct the future refinement of LMMs for their visual acuity. Together,\nour research underscores the significance of LMM-JND as a unique perspective\nfor studying LMMs, and predictable LMM-JND is crucial for security concerns.\nThis work will be available at https://github.com/zijianchen98/LMM-JND.",

Numerous enumeration\nalgorithms have been developed for this purpose. To be a statistically\nmeaningful representation of the whole join result, the result tuples are\nrequired to be enumerated in uniformly random order. However, existing studies\nlack an efficient random-order enumeration algorithm with a worst-case runtime\nguarantee for (cyclic) join queries. In this paper, we study the problem of\nenumerating the results of a join query in random order. We develop an\nefficient random-order enumeration algorithm for join queries with no large\nhidden constants in its complexity, achieving expected\n$O(\\frac{\\mathrm{AGM}(Q)}{|Res(Q)|}\\log^2|Q|)$ delay,\n$O(\\mathrm{AGM}(Q)\\log|Q|)$ total running time after $O(|Q|\\log|Q|)$-time index\nconstruction, where $|Q|$ is the size of input, $\\mathrm{AGM}(Q)$ is the AGM\nbound, and $|Res(Q)|$ is the size of the join result. We prove that our\nalgorithm is near-optimal in the worst case, under the combinatorial $k$-clique\nhypothesis. Our algorithm requires no query-specific preprocessing and can be\nflexibly adapted to many common database indexes with only minor modifications.\nWe also devise two non-trivial techniques to speed up the enumeration, and\nprovide an experimental study on our enumeration algorithm along with the\nspeed-up techniques.

In fact, personality\nconsiderations may have a greater impact on software development than processes\nand tools. This paper aims to design a study that measures the impact of HEXACO\npersonality traits on the Teamwork Quality (TWQ) of software teams. A\npreliminary data collection (n=54) was conducted for this purpose. The analysis\nshowed that several personality traits, as well as their composition, had a\nsignificant impact on TWQ. Additionally, other variables, such as the\nproportion of women and age distribution, also affected TWQ. The study's\ninitial results demonstrate the usefulness and validity of the study design.\nThe results also suggest several opportunities to improve teamwork in IT\norganizations and avenues for further research.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing high-dimensional black-box functions under black-box constraints\nis a pervasive task in a wide range of scientific and engineering problems.\nThese problems are typically harder than unconstrained problems due to\nhard-to-find feasible regions. While Bayesian optimization (BO) methods have\nbeen developed to solve such problems, they often struggle with the curse of\ndimensionality. Recently, generative model-based approaches have emerged as a\npromising alternative for constrained optimization. However, they suffer from\npoor scalability and are vulnerable to mode collapse, particularly when the\ntarget distribution is highly multi-modal. In this paper, we propose a new\nframework to overcome these challenges. Our method iterates through two stages.\nFirst, we train flow-based models to capture the data distribution and\nsurrogate models that predict both function values and constraint violations\nwith uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection\nproblem as a posterior inference problem to effectively search for promising\ncandidates that have high objective values while not violating the constraints.\nDuring posterior inference, we find that the posterior distribution is highly\nmulti-modal and has a large plateau due to constraints, especially when\nconstraint feedback is given as binary indicators of feasibility. To mitigate\nthis issue, we amortize the sampling from the posterior distribution in the\nlatent space of flow-based models, which is much smoother than that in the data\nspace. We empirically demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance\non various synthetic and real-world constrained black-box optimization tasks.\nOur code is publicly available \\href{https://github.com/umkiyoung/CiBO}{here}.",

    "abstract": "Among all types of crashes, rear-end crashes dominate, which are closely\nrelated to the car-following (CF) behaviors. Traditional CF behavior models\nfocused on the influence of the vehicle in front, but usually ignored the peer\npressure from the surrounding road users, including the following vehicle (FV).\nBased on an open dataset, the highD dataset, we investigated whether the FV's\nstates can affect the CF behavior of the ego-vehicle in CF events. Two types of\nCF events were extracted from highD database, including the tailgated events,\nwhere the time headway between the FV and the ego-vehicle (i.e., time gap) was\nsmaller than 1 second, and the gapped events, where the time gap was larger\nthan 3 seconds. The dynamic time warping was used to extract CF pairs with\nsimilar speed profiles of the leading vehicle (LV). Statistical analyses were\nconducted to compare the CF-performance metrics in tailgated and gapped events.\nThen, the inverse reinforcement learning was used to recover the reward\nfunction of the ego-vehicle drivers in different CF events. The results showed\nthat the ego-driver would adjust their CF behavior in response to the pressure\nfrom a tailgating FV, by maintaining a closer distance to the LV, but at the\nsame time, driving more cautiously. Further, drivers were still able to adjust\ntheir CF strategies based on the speed of traffic flow and the distance to the\nLV, even when being tailgated. These findings provide insights regarding more\naccurate modelling of traffic flow by considering the peer pressure from\nsurrounding road users.",

In this work, we focus\non analyzing and improving the long-context modeling capabilities of SSMs. We\nshow that the widely used synthetic task, associative recall, which requires a\nmodel to recall a value associated with a single key without context,\ninsufficiently represents the complexities of real-world long-context modeling.\nTo address this limitation, we extend the associative recall to a novel\nsynthetic task, \\emph{joint recall}, which requires a model to recall the value\nassociated with a key given in a specified context. Theoretically, we prove\nthat SSMs do not have the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall in\nsub-quadratic time complexity. To resolve this issue, we propose a solution\nbased on integrating SSMs with Context-Dependent Sparse Attention (CDSA), which\nhas the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall with sub-quadratic\ncomputation.

To achieve\nminimal distortion while maintaining perfect perceptual quality, Posterior-Mean\nRectified Flow (PMRF) proposes a flow based approach where source distribution\nis minimum distortion estimations. Although PMRF is shown to be effective, its\npixel-space modeling approach limits its ability to align with human\nperception, where human perception is defined as how humans distinguish between\ntwo image distributions. In this work, we propose Latent-PMRF, which\nreformulates PMRF in the latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE),\nfacilitating better alignment with human perception during optimization. By\ndefining the source distribution on latent representations of minimum\ndistortion estimation, we bound the minimum distortion by the VAE's\nreconstruction error. Moreover, we reveal the design of VAE is crucial, and our\nproposed VAE significantly outperforms existing VAEs in both reconstruction and\nrestoration.

Our method casts the problem as policy\ndistillation: it collects off-policy data during the roll-in phase, simulates\nreward-based soft-optimal policies during roll-out, and updates the model by\nminimizing the KL divergence between the simulated soft-optimal policy and the\ncurrent model policy. Our off-policy formulation, combined with KL divergence\nminimization, enhances training stability and sample efficiency compared to\nexisting RL-based methods.

It is often used as a standard reference for\nstudying the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of carbon-rich stars. While\npioneering 3\\,mm spectral surveys have laid foundational datasets, their system\ntemperature limitations rendered spectral line detection thresholds inadequate\nfor probing the source's complex organic molecule inventory at this band, which\nmade superseding observations necessary. We aim to gain an unbiased view\nregarding circumstellar chemistry and investigate whether IRC+10216 is typical\nor anomalous in terms of its chemical composition. We carried out an in-depth\nspectral line survey of the circumstellar envelope of IRC+10216 utilizing the\nArizona Radio Observatory 12\\,m telescope. We achieved complete spectral\nsampling across the 90--116 GHz atmospheric window ($\\lambda=2.6$--3.3\\,mm). A\ntotal of 214 emission lines belonging to 43 molecular species are identified in\nthe CSE of IRC+10216, among which 28 lines are newly detected in this object\nand four emission lines remain unidentified. The excitation temperatures and\ncolumn densities of 16 molecules are determined through rotation diagrams. We\nestimate the isotopic ratios of carbon, oxygen, and silicon elements. For the\nmajority of the molecular species, the line intensity ratios between IRC+10216\nand CIT\\,6 are inversely proportional to the square of their distance, which\nsuggests that the chemical processes occurring within them are similar.\nNevertheless, there is evidence suggesting that the emission of C$_{4}$H and\nC$_{3}$N in IRC+10216 is unusually strong. These observations stand as the most\nsensitive and unbiased line survey of IRC+10216 within the $\\lambda=3$ window\ncarried out by a single-dish telescope.

To answer this question, we evaluate over 20\nopen-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including\nmath, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard\ninstruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in\nmath fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this\nphenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using\nmath-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space\nrepresentation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT\ninduces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves\ngeneral-domain structure.

Although similar capabilities have been explored for\nrelational databases, their implementation for graph databases presents unique\nchallenges. This is mainly attributed to the relatively large complexity of\nqueries in graph databases. When translating graph queries into arithmetic\ncircuits, the circuit scale can be too large to be practically evaluated. To\naddress this issue, we propose to break down graph queries into more\nfine-grained, primitive operators, enabling a step-by-step evaluation through\nsmaller-scale circuits. Accordingly, the verification with ZKP circuits of\ncomplex graph queries can be decomposed into a series of composable\ncryptographic primitives, each designed to verify a fundamental structural\nproperty such as path ordering or edge directionality. Especially, having\nnoticed that the graph expansion (i.e., traversing from nodes to their\nneighbors along edges) operation serves as the backbone of graph query\nevaluation, we design the expansion centric operator decomposition. In addition\nto constructing circuits for the expansion primitives, we also design\nspecialized ZKP circuits for the various attributes that augment this\ntraversal. The circuits are meticulously designed to take advantage of PLONKish\narithmetization. By integrating these optimized circuits, we implement ZKGraph,\na system that provides verifiable query processing while preserving data\nprivacy. Performance evaluation indicates that ZKGraph significantly\noutperforms naive in circuit implementations of graph operators, achieving\nsubstantial improvements in both runtime and memory consumption.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of cooperation in networked systems helps to understand the\ndynamics in social networks, multi-agent systems, and biological species. The\nself-persistence of individual strategies is common in real-world decision\nmaking. The self-replacement of strategies in evolutionary dynamics forms a\nselection amplifier, allows an agent to insist on its autologous strategy, and\nhelps the networked system to avoid full defection. In this paper, we study the\nself-interaction learning in the networked evolutionary dynamics. We propose a\nself-interaction landscape to capture the strength of an agent's self-loop to\nreproduce the strategy based on local topology. We find that proper\nself-interaction can reduce the condition for cooperation and help cooperators\nto prevail in the system. For a system that favors the evolution of spite, the\nself-interaction can save cooperative agents from being harmed. Our results on\nrandom networks further suggest that an appropriate self-interaction landscape\ncan significantly reduce the critical condition for advantageous mutants,\nespecially for large-degree networks.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have proven to be effective on medical datasets for\naccurate diagnostic predictions from images. However, medical datasets often\ncontain noisy, mislabeled, or poorly generalizable images, particularly for\nedge cases and anomalous outcomes. Additionally, high quality datasets are\noften small in sample size that can result in overfitting, where models\nmemorize noise rather than learn generalizable patterns. This in particular,\ncould pose serious risks in medical diagnostics where the risk associated with\nmis-classification can impact human life. Several data-efficient training\nstrategies have emerged to address these constraints. In particular, coreset\nselection identifies compact subsets of the most representative samples,\nenabling training that approximates full-dataset performance while reducing\ncomputational overhead. On the other hand, curriculum learning relies on\ngradually increasing training difficulty and accelerating convergence.

    "abstract": "Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural\nhazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains\nfragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation,\nstratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each\ntightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We\nintroduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative\narchitecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference\nalong latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This\nformulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference\nmechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs,\nmasks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce\ngeologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot\ngeneralization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining\nfor new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage\ntraining process that combines self-supervised representation learning on\nlarge-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts\nand labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad\napplicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy\nanalysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic\nstratigraphic interpretation, geobody segmentation, and property modeling. By\nbridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware\nmanner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical\nAI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated,\npromptable reasoning system.

Open-source replications of reasoning models, while successful,\nbuild upon models that already exhibit strong reasoning capabilities along with\nsearch behavior observed even before RL. As a result, it is yet unclear how to\nboost the reasoning capabilities of other non-reasoner models including Llama\n3. ASTRO teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through\na synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over\nmathematical problem-solving trajectories. By converting search traces into\nnatural language chain-of-thoughts that capture both successes and recoveries\nfrom failure, ASTRO bootstraps models with a rich prior for exploration during\nRL. We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve\nperformance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply ASTRO to the Llama 3\nfamily of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500,\n26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon\nchallenging problems that require iterative correction.

The purpose of \\emph{partial label learning}\n(PLL) is to identify the ground-truth label from a set of candidate labels\nassociated with a given instance. Inspired by the remarkable performance of\ndiffusion models in various generation tasks, this paper explores their\npotential to denoise ambiguous labels through the reverse denoising process.\nTherefore, this paper reformulates the label disambiguation problem from the\nperspective of generative models, where labels are generated by iteratively\nrefining initial random guesses. This perspective enables the diffusion model\nto learn how label information is generated stochastically. By modeling the\ngeneration uncertainty, we can use the maximum likelihood estimate of the label\nfor classification inference. However, such ambiguous labels lead to a mismatch\nbetween instance and label, which reduces the quality of generated data. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposes a \\emph{diffusion disambiguation model\nfor PLL} (DDMP), which first uses the potential complementary information\nbetween instances and labels to construct pseudo-clean labels for initial\ndiffusion training. Furthermore, a transition-aware matrix is introduced to\nestimate the potential ground-truth labels, which are dynamically updated\nduring the diffusion generation. During training, the ground-truth label is\nprogressively refined, improving the classifier. Experiments show the advantage\nof the DDMP and its suitability for PLL.",

Determining whether or not a physical system\nwill thermalize from an initial state has been a key question in condensed\nmatter physics. Closely related questions are determining whether observables\nin these systems relax to stationary values, and what those values are. Using\ntools from computational complexity theory, we demonstrate that given a\nHamiltonian on a finite-sized system, determining whether or not it thermalizes\nor relaxes to a given stationary value is computationally intractable, even for\na quantum computer. In particular, we show that the problem of determining\nwhether an observable of a finite-sized quantum system relaxes to a given value\nis PSPACE-complete, and so no efficient algorithm for determining the value is\nexpected to exist. Further, we show the existence of Hamiltonians for which the\nproblem of determining whether the system thermalizes is contained in PSPACE\nand is PSPACE-hard under quantum polynomial time reductions. We also present\nevidence that determining thermalization is PSPACE-hard under classical\npolynomial time reductions and state a physically reasonable conjecture under\nwhich it is PSPACE-complete. In light of recent results demonstrating\nundecidability of thermalization in the thermodynamic limit, our work shows\nthat the intractability of the problem is due to inherent difficulties in\nmany-body physics rather than particularities of infinite systems.",

Handling the\nlow-quality and static embeddings produced by frozen, \"black-box\" backbones\nleads to a problem representation of few-shot classification as a series of\nmultiple instance verification (MIV) tasks. Inspired by this representation, we\nintroduce a novel approach to few-shot domain adaptation, named the \"MIV-head\",\nakin to a classification head that is agnostic to any pretrained backbone and\ncomputationally efficient. The core components designed for the MIV-head, when\ntrained on few-shot data from a target domain, collectively yield strong\nperformance on test data from that domain. Importantly, it does so without\nfine-tuning the backbone, and within the \"meta-testing\" phase. Experimenting\nunder various settings and on an extension of the Meta-dataset benchmark for\ncross-domain few-shot image classification, using representative off-the-shelf\nconvolutional neural network and vision transformer backbones pretrained on\nImageNet1K, we show that the MIV-head achieves highly competitive accuracy when\ncompared to state-of-the-art \"adapter\" (or partially fine-tuning) methods\napplied to the same backbones, while incurring substantially lower adaptation\ncost.

    "abstract": "In random walk theory, it is customary to assume that a given walk is\nirreducible and/or aperiodic. While these prevailing assumptions make\nparticularly tractable the analysis of random walks and help to highlight their\ndiffusive nature, they eliminate a natural phenomenon: the dance. This dance\ncan be seen, for example, in the so-called simple random walk on the integers\nwhere a random walker moves back and forth between even and odd integers. It\ncan also be seen in the random walk on the integer lattice that takes only\nthose steps available to a knight on a chess board. In this work, we develop a\ngeneral Fourier-analytic method to describe random walks on finitely-generated\nabelian groups, making no assumptions concerning aperiodicity or\nirreducibility. Our main result is a local central limit theorems that\ndescribes the large-time behavior of the transition probabilities for any\nrandom walk whose driving measure has finite second moments. Generalizing the\nubiquitous Gaussian approximation, our asymptotic is given as a product of two\nfunctions, one that describes the diffusion and another that describes the\ndance. Interestingly, our ``dance function\" is gotten as a Haar integral over a\nsubgroup of the group's Pontryagin dual.

    "abstract": "The toughness of a graph $G$ is defined as the minimum value of $|S|/c(G-S)$\nover all cutsets $S$ of $G$ if $G$ is noncomplete, and is defined to be\n$\\infty$ if $G$ is complete. For a real number $t$, we say that $G$ is\n$t$-tough if its toughness is at least $t$. Followed from the classic 1956\nresult of Tutte, every more than $\\frac{3}{2}$-tough planar graph on at least\nthree vertices has a 2-factor. In 1999, Owens constructed a sequence of maximal\nplanar graphs with toughness $\\frac{3}{2}-\\varepsilon$ for any $\\varepsilon\n>0$, but the graphs do not contain any 2-factor. He then posed the question of\nwhether there exists a maximal planar graph with toughness exactly\n$\\frac{3}{2}$ and with no 2-factor. This question was recently answered\naffirmatively by the third author. This naturally leads to the question: under\nwhat conditions does a $\\frac{3}{2}$-tough maximal planar graph contain a\n2-factor? In this paper, we provide a sufficient condition for the existence of\n2-factors in $\\frac{3}{2}$-tough maximal planar graphs, stated as a bound on\nthe distance between vertices of degree 3.",

To relieve these challenges, we propose HelixPipe,\na novel pipeline parallelism for long sequence transformer training. First,\nHelixPipe introduces attention parallel partition, which schedules attention\ncomputations of different micro batches across different pipeline stages in\nparallel, reducing pipeline bubbles. Second, it employs a two-fold\nfirst-in-last-out micro batch schedule to balance memory usage and overlap\ncommunication with computation. Additionally, HelixPipe utilizes recomputation\nwithout attention and chunked MLP to mitigate fragmentation and enable longer\nsequences. Experiments demonstrate that HelixPipe gains increasing advantages\nwith longer sequence lengths, and outperforms existing methods in throughput\nand scalability across varying pipeline sizes, model sizes, and cluster\nconfigurations. Notably, it achieves a 26\\% speedup over baseline methods when\ntraining a 7B model with 128k sequence length on 64 H20 GPUs.

There is an increasing effort to\nendow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with similar spatial reasoning\ncapabilities. However, it remains unclear whether these models truly understand\nand manipulate spatial objects or not. To address this question, we propose a\nnew evaluation framework aimed at assessing the performance of VLMs in spatial\ndeformation reasoning tasks. Specifically, we construct a benchmark for spatial\ndeformation reasoning from 2D to 3D. Leveraging our data engine, we can\ngenerate unlimited evaluation problem pairs with infinite steps, without any\ndata leakage. We explore whether the model can effectively perform spatial\ndeformation reasoning from two directions: forward reasoning (given the\noperations, find the final state) and reverse reasoning (given the final state,\ndetermine the operations). We adopt a ladder competition format, using the\nnumber of deformation steps as the level classification criterion, with the\ngoal of exploring the boundaries of the model's deformation reasoning\ncapabilities. Interestingly, the benchmarking results reveal that almost no\nmodel demonstrates plausible spatial deformation reasoning abilities.\nFurthermore, even after applying targeted training and mainstream reasoning\nenhancement methods, the models are still unable to perform well on 3D spatial\ndeformation reasoning.",

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with mechanical\nengineering students in a Learning Studio environment, capturing stories about\nhands-on coursework, peer support, and personal growth.

    "abstract": "Metasurface lenses are miniature flat lenses that can precisely control the\nphase, amplitude, and polarization of incident light by modulating the\nparameters of each unit on the substrate. Compared with conventional optical\nlenses, they have the advantages of small size, light weight, and high\nintegration, and are the core components of photonic chips. Currently, the hot\ntopics for metasurface lens are broadband and achromatic devices, and there is\nstill less attention paid to the resolution improvement. To break through the\ndiffraction limit and further improve the focusing performance and imaging\nresolution of metasurface lenses, we use unit cells to perform\nmulti-dimensional modulation of the incident light field. Specifically, in this\npaper, we combine phase modulation of metasurface lens with a pupil filtering,\nwhich has been widely applied to traditional microscopy imaging and adaptive\noptics and has demonstrated powerful resolution enhancement effects. The\nintegrating of these two technologies will continue to improve the imaging\nperformance of metasurface lenses and thus expanding their application fields.\nThis result preliminarily demonstrates the super-resolution performance of the\nintegrated meta-surface lens. With the comprehensive regulation of\nmulti-dimensional information, such as amplitude, polarization, and vortex, the\nintegrated meta-surface optical lens will achieve more excellent\nsuper-resolution focusing and imaging performance, and will also be widely used\nin the fields of super-resolution imaging, virtual reality, and\nthree-dimensional optical display, due to its characteristics of high\nresolution, high integration, and high miniaturization.",

    "abstract": "The idea that Gregorian melodies are constructed from some vocabulary of\nsegments has long been a part of chant scholarship. This so-called\n\"centonisation\" theory has received much musicological criticism, but frequent\nre-use of certain melodic segments has been observed in chant melodies, and the\nintractable number of possible segmentations allowed the option that some\nundiscovered segmentation exists that will yet prove the value of\ncentonisation, and recent empirical results have shown that segmentations can\noutperform music-theoretical features in mode classification. Inspired by the\nfact that Gregorian chant was memorised, we search for an optimal unsupervised\nsegmentation of chant melody using nested hierarchical Pitman-Yor language\nmodels. The segmentation we find achieves state-of-the-art performance in mode\nclassification. Modeling a monk memorising the melodies from one liturgical\nmanuscript, we then find empirical evidence for the link between mode\nclassification and memory efficiency, and observe more formulaic areas at the\nbeginnings and ends of melodies corresponding to the practical role of modality\nin performance. However, the resulting segmentations themselves indicate that\neven such a memory-optimal segmentation is not what is understood as\ncentonisation.",

However, as the users\n(including human clients and downstream machine tasks) become more diverse,\nROI-based image compression needs to be customizable to support various\npreferences. For example, different users may define distinct ROI or require\ndifferent quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI. Existing ROI-based image\ncompression schemes predefine the ROI, making it unchangeable, and lack\neffective mechanisms to balance reconstruction quality between ROI and non-ROI.\nThis work proposes a paradigm for customizable ROI-based deep image\ncompression. First, we develop a Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA) module,\nwhich allows users to easily customize their ROI for compression by just\ninputting the corresponding semantic \\emph{text}.

Second, we design a Customizable Value Assign (CVA)\nmechanism, which masks the non-ROI with a changeable extent decided by users\ninstead of a constant one to manage the reconstruction quality trade-off\nbetween ROI and non-ROI. Finally, we present a Latent Mask Attention (LMA)\nmodule, where the latent spatial prior of the mask and the latent\nRate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) prior of the image are extracted and fused\nin the latent space, and further used to optimize the latent representation of\nthe source image.

The design exploits\ntransposition-invariance property of the MixColumns and MixRows function and\nalternates the order of intermediate state to eliminate bubbles in stream key\ngeneration, improving latency and throughput. We decouple the RNG and key\ncomputation phases to hide the latency of RNG and to reduce the critical path\nin FIFOs, achieving higher operating frequency.\n  We implement the accelerator on an AMD Virtex UltraScale+ FPGA. Both Rubato\nand HERA achieve a 6x improvement in throughput compared to the software\nimplementation. In terms of latency, Rubato achieves a 5x reduction, while HERA\nachieves a 3x reduction. Additionally, our hardware implementations reduce\nenergy consumption by 75x for Rubato and 47x for HERA compared to their\nsoftware implementation.",

    "abstract": "While initial applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in wireless\ncommunications over the past decade have demonstrated considerable potential\nusing specialized models for targeted communication tasks, the revolutionary\ndemands of sixth-generation (6G) networks for holographic communications,\nubiquitous sensing, and native intelligence are propelling a necessary\nevolution towards AI-native wireless networks. The arrival of large AI models\npaves the way for the next phase of Wireless AI, driven by wireless foundation\nmodels (WFMs). In particular, pre-training on universal electromagnetic (EM)\nprinciples equips WFMs with the essential adaptability for a multitude of\ndemanding 6G applications. However, existing large AI models face critical\nlimitations, including pre-training strategies disconnected from EM-compliant\nconstraints leading to physically inconsistent predictions, a lack of embedded\nunderstanding of wave propagation physics, and the inaccessibility of massive\nlabeled datasets for comprehensive EM-aware training. To address these\nchallenges, this article presents an electromagnetic information theory-guided\nself-supervised pre-training (EIT-SPT) framework designed to systematically\ninject EM physics into WFMs. The EIT-SPT framework aims to infuse WFMs with\nintrinsic EM knowledge, thereby enhancing their physical consistency,\ngeneralization capabilities across varied EM landscapes, and overall data\nefficiency. Building upon the proposed EIT-SPT framework, this article first\nelaborates on diverse potential applications in 6G scenarios of WFMs, then\nvalidates the efficacy of the proposed framework through illustrative case\nstudies, and finally summarizes critical open research challenges and future\ndirections for WFMs.",

    "abstract": "Handwriting signatures, as an important means of identity recognition, are\nwidely used in multiple fields such as financial transactions, commercial\ncontracts and personal affairs due to their legal effect and uniqueness. In\nforensic science appraisals, the analysis of offline handwriting signatures\nrequires the appraiser to provide a certain number of signature samples, which\nare usually derived from various historical contracts or archival materials.\nHowever, the provided handwriting samples are often mixed with a large amount\nof interfering information, which brings severe challenges to handwriting\nidentification work. This study proposes a signature handwriting denoising\nmodel based on the improved U-net structure, aiming to enhance the robustness\nof the signature recognition system. By introducing discrete wavelet transform\nand PCA transform, the model's ability to suppress noise has been enhanced. The\nexperimental results show that this modelis significantly superior to the\ntraditional methods in denoising effect, can effectively improve the clarity\nand readability of the signed images, and provide more reliable technical\nsupport for signature analysis and recognition.",

However, this migration also introduces new\nsecurity challenges. Ensuring the protection of sensitive data, maintaining\ncompliance with regulatory requirements, and mitigating the risks of cyber\nthreats are critical issues that must be addressed.

However, 3DGS heavily depends on accurate\ninitialization and faces difficulties in optimizing unstructured Gaussian\ndistributions into ordered surfaces, with limited adaptive density control\nmechanism proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a geometry-guided\ninitialization to predict Gaussian parameters, ensuring precise placement and\nfaster convergence. We then introduce a surface-aligned optimization strategy\nto refine Gaussian placement, improving geometric accuracy and aligning with\nthe surface normals of the scene. Finally, we present a dynamic adaptive\ndensity control mechanism that adjusts Gaussian density based on regional\ncomplexity, for visual fidelity. These innovations enable our method to achieve\nhigh-fidelity real-time rendering and significant improvements in visual\nquality, even in complex scenes.

The framework integrates seasonal contrast, augmentation-based\ncontrast, and masked patch token contrastive strategies for pre-training.\nComprehensive evaluations across 10 benchmark datasets covering four typical RS\ntasks demonstrate that the CGEarthEye consistently achieves state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance. Further analysis reveals CGEarthEye's superior\ncharacteristics in feature visualization, model convergence, parameter\nefficiency, and practical mapping applications. This study anticipates that the\nexceptional representation capabilities of CGEarthEye will facilitate broader\nand more efficient applications of Jilin-1 data in traditional EO application.",

    "abstract": "Grounding large language models (LLMs) in verifiable external sources is a\nwell-established strategy for generating reliable answers. Retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) is one such approach, particularly effective for tasks like\nquestion answering: it retrieves passages that are semantically related to the\nquestion and then conditions the model on this evidence. However, multi-hop\nquestions, such as \"Which company among NVIDIA, Apple, and Google made the\nbiggest profit in 2023?,\" challenge RAG because relevant facts are often\ndistributed across multiple documents rather than co-occurring in one source,\nmaking it difficult for standard RAG to retrieve sufficient information. To\naddress this, we propose a RAG pipeline that incorporates question\ndecomposition: (i) an LLM decomposes the original query into sub-questions,\n(ii) passages are retrieved for each sub-question, and (iii) the merged\ncandidate pool is reranked to improve the coverage and precision of the\nretrieved evidence. We show that question decomposition effectively assembles\ncomplementary documents, while reranking reduces noise and promotes the most\nrelevant passages before answer generation. Although reranking itself is\nstandard, we show that pairing an off-the-shelf cross-encoder reranker with\nLLM-driven question decomposition bridges the retrieval gap on multi-hop\nquestions and provides a practical, drop-in enhancement, without any extra\ntraining or specialized indexing. We evaluate our approach on the MultiHop-RAG\nand HotpotQA, showing gains in retrieval (MRR@10: +36.7%) and answer accuracy\n(F1: +11.6%) over standard RAG baselines.",

    "abstract": "Accurate electrochemical models are essential for the safe and efficient\noperation of lithium-ion batteries in real-world applications such as\nelectrified vehicles and grid storage. Reduced-order models (ROM) offer a\nbalance between fidelity and computational efficiency but often struggle to\ncapture complex and nonlinear behaviors, such as the dynamics in the cell\nvoltage response under high C-rate conditions. To address these limitations,\nthis study proposes an Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Identification (AESI) framework\nthat enhances the accuracy of reduced-order li-ion battery models by\ncompensating for unpredictable dynamics. The approach integrates an Extended\nSingle Particle Model (ESPM) with an evolutionary ensemble sparse learning\nstrategy to construct a robust hybrid model. In addition, the AESI framework\nincorporates a conformal prediction method to provide theoretically guaranteed\nuncertainty quantification for voltage error dynamics, thereby improving the\nreliability of the model's predictions. Evaluation across diverse operating\nconditions shows that the hybrid model (ESPM + AESI) improves the voltage\nprediction accuracy, achieving mean squared error reductions of up to 46% on\nunseen data. Prediction reliability is further supported by conformal\nprediction, yielding statistically valid prediction intervals with coverage\nratios of 96.85% and 97.41% for the ensemble models based on bagging and\nstability selection, respectively.",

The aim of this algorithm is to provide\na fast, straightforward, and accurate route to estimating dark matter halo\nmasses and group membership in wide-field spectroscopic galaxy surveys. This\napproach requires a highly limited number of input parameters and yields full\nprobability distribution functions for the output halo masses. To achieve this,\nwe train a series of Random Forest (RF) regression models on the IllustrisTNG\nand EAGLE simulations at z=0-3, which provide model-dependent mappings from\nluminous tracers to dark matter halo properties. We incorporate the individual\nregression models into a virial group-finding algorithm (DfL), which outputs\nhalo properties for observational-like input data. We test the method at z=0-2\nfor both the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG models, as well as in a cross-validation\nmode. We demonstrate that known halo masses can be recovered with a mean\nsystematic bias of $\\langle b \\rangle = \\pm 0.10\\,$dex (resulting from\nsimulation choice), a mean statistical uncertainty of $\\langle \\sigma \\rangle =\n0.12 \\,$dex across epochs, and a central - (core) satellite classification\naccuracy of 96%. We establish that this approach yields superior halo mass\nrecovery to standard abundance matching applied to groups identified through a\nfriends-of-friends algorithm. Additionally, we compare the outputs of DfL to\nobservational constraints on the $M_* - M_{\\rm Halo}$ relation from strong\ngravitational lensing at $z \\sim 0$, demonstrating the promise of this novel\napproach. Finally, we systematically quantify how DfL performs on\nobservational-like input data with varying stellar mass uncertainty and\nspectroscopic incompleteness, enabling robust error calibration.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) origami tessellations such as the Miura-ori are often\ngeneralized to build three-dimensional (3D) architected materials with sandwich\nor cellular structures. However, such 3D blocks are densely packed with\ncontinuity of the internal material, while for many engineering structures with\nmulti-physical functionality, it is necessary to have thin sheets that are\nseparately spaced and sparsely connected. This work presents a framework for\nthe design and analysis of multi-layered spaced origami, which provides an\norigami solution for 3D structures where multiple flat sheets are intentionally\nspaced apart. We connect Miura-ori sheets with sparsely installed thin-sheet\nparallelogram-like linkages. To explore how this connectivity approach affects\nthe behavior of the origami system, we model the rigid-folding kinematics using\nanalytic trigonometry and rigid-body transformations, and we characterize the\nelastic-folding mechanics by generalizing a reduced order bar and hinge model\nfor these 3D assemblies. The orientation of the linkages in the multi-layered\nspaced origami determines which of three folding paths the system will follow\nincluding a flat foldable type, a self-locking type, and a double-branch type.\nWhen the origami is flat foldable, a maximized packing ratio and a uniform\nin-plane shear stiffness can be achieved by strategically choosing the link\norientation. We show possible applications by demonstrating how the\nmulti-layered spaced origami can be used to build deployable acoustic cloaks\nand heat shields.",

We study $\\mathfrak{ca}$ up to first order in quantum correction.\nIn particular, we show that the $\\mathfrak{ca}$ associated with anomaly-free\nholomorphic twistorial higher-spin theories are associative themselves, while\nthe chiral algebras associated with anomalous holomorphic twistorial\nhigher-spin theories only become associative upon enlarging $\\mathfrak{ca}$ by\nintroducing suitable axionic currents. Furthermore, we compute four-dimensional\nform factors -- interpreted as genuine scattering amplitudes in the integrable\nsector -- via correlation functions of some chiral CFTs that can source\nhigher-spin currents of $\\mathfrak{ca}$ on the celestial twistor sphere.\nNotably, we observe that higher-spin form factors do not always vanish,\nsuggesting the existence of some mysterious bulk theories.",

Until\nnow, no data has provided an additional dimension for object context: the\npossibility of multiple cameras sharing a view of a scene. We introduce\nMOVi-MC-AC: Multiple Object Video with Multi-Cameras and Amodal Content, the\nlargest amodal segmentation and first amodal content dataset to date. Cluttered\nscenes of generic household objects are simulated in multi-camera video.\nMOVi-MC-AC contributes to the growing literature of object detection, tracking,\nand segmentation by including two new contributions to the deep learning for\ncomputer vision world. Multiple Camera (MC) settings where objects can be\nidentified and tracked between various unique camera perspectives are rare in\nboth synthetic and real-world video. We introduce a new complexity to synthetic\nvideo by providing consistent object ids for detections and segmentations\nbetween both frames and multiple cameras each with unique features and motion\npatterns on a single scene. Amodal Content (AC) is a reconstructive task in\nwhich models predict the appearance of target objects through occlusions. In\nthe amodal segmentation literature, some datasets have been released with\namodal detection, tracking, and segmentation labels. While other methods rely\non slow cut-and-paste schemes to generate amodal content pseudo-labels, they do\nnot account for natural occlusions present in the modal masks. MOVi-MC-AC\nprovides labels for ~5.8 million object instances, setting a new maximum in the\namodal dataset literature, along with being the first to provide ground-truth\namodal content.

Radical-radical reactions on grains surface between species such as $\\rm\nCH_3$, $\\rm CH_3O$ and $\\rm HCO$ efficiently proceed non-diffusively. COMs are\ndelivered to the gas phase via chemical desorption amplified by the loops of\nH-addition/abstraction surface reactions. However, gas-phase chemical reactions\nas well provide a noticeable input to the formation of COMs in the gas, but not\nto the COMs solid-state abundances. This particularly applies for CH$_3$CHO and\nCH$_3$OCH$_3$. The simulated abundances of COMs in the ice are in the range\n1\\%--2\\% (for methyl formate ice) or $\\sim$~0.1\\% (for CH$_3$CHO and\nCH$_3$OCH$_3$) with respect to the abundance of H$_2$O ice.

We identify two major types of RAN buffers -\nretransmission buffers and uplink scheduling buffers - that can introduce\ndelays comparable to congestion-induced delays, severely degrading protocol\nperformance. We present CellNinjia, a software-based system providing real-time\nvisibility into RAN operations, and Gandalf, which leverages this visibility to\nsystematically handle RAN-induced delays. Unlike existing approaches that treat\nthese delays as random noise, Gandalf identifies specific RAN operations and\ncompensates for their effects. Our evaluation in commercial 4G LTE and 5G\nnetworks shows that Gandalf enables substantial performance improvements - up\nto 7.49x for Copa and 9.53x for PCC Vivace - without modifying the protocols'\ncore algorithms, demonstrating that delay-based protocols can realize their\nfull potential in cellular networks.",
