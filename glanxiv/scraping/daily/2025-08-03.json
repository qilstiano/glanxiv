    "abstract": "Non-Verbal Vocalisations (NVVs) are short `non-word' utterances without\nproper linguistic (semantic) meaning but conveying connotations -- be this\nemotions/affects or other paralinguistic information. We start this\ncontribution with a historic sketch: how they were addressed in psychology and\nlinguistics in the last two centuries, how they were neglected later on, and\nhow they came to the fore with the advent of emotion research. We then give an\noverview of types of NVVs (formal aspects) and functions of NVVs, exemplified\nwith the typical NVV \\textit{ah}. Interesting as they are, NVVs come, however,\nwith a bunch of challenges that should be accounted for: Privacy and general\nethical considerations prevent them of being recorded in real-life (private)\nscenarios to a sufficient extent. Isolated, prompted (acted) exemplars do not\nnecessarily model NVVs in context; yet, this is the preferred strategy so far\nwhen modelling NVVs, especially in AI. To overcome these problems, we argue in\nfavour of corpus-based approaches. This guarantees a more realistic modelling;\nhowever, we are still faced with privacy and sparse data problems.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over long documents typically involves\nsplitting the text into smaller chunks, which serve as the basic units for\nretrieval. However, due to dependencies across the original document,\ncontextual information is often essential for accurately interpreting each\nchunk. To address this, prior work has explored encoding longer context windows\nto produce embeddings for longer chunks. Despite these efforts, gains in\nretrieval and downstream tasks remain limited. This is because (1) longer\nchunks strain the capacity of embedding models due to the increased amount of\ninformation they must encode, and (2) many real-world applications still\nrequire returning localized evidence due to constraints on model or human\nbandwidth.\n  We propose an alternative approach to this challenge by representing short\nchunks in a way that is conditioned on a broader context window to enhance\nretrieval performance -- i.e., situating a chunk's meaning within its context.\nWe further show that existing embedding models are not well-equipped to encode\nsuch situated context effectively, and thus introduce a new training paradigm\nand develop the situated embedding models (SitEmb). To evaluate our method, we\ncurate a book-plot retrieval dataset specifically designed to assess situated\nretrieval capabilities.

The main theoretical advancement is a spectral flow formula that\ndetects bifurcation points and quantifies stability changes under noise\nperturbations.

In this work, we\nestablish, for the first time to our knowledge, a fundamental relationship that\nexpresses the chemical potential as a function of temperature, material\nproperties, and excitation conditions, enabling a treatment of PL analogous to\nPlanck's law with thermal radiation. This formulation allows for the analysis\nof temperature-dependent PL properties, including spectral emission, entropy,\ntemporal coherence, and photon statistics, capturing the transition from\nnarrowband pump-induced to broadband thermal emission. Notably, we identify a\ntemperature range where the emission rate is quasi-conserved, associated with\nthe previously reported blueshift. This is followed by a rapid transition to\nthermal behavior, reflected in both the chemical potential and entropy.\nConversely, the coherence time and photon statistics evolve smoothly across the\nentire temperature range.

We consider the case in which the\nelastic interface is clamped at the lateral walls of a closed trough and thus\nencloses a finite amount of fluid. For a slender film undergoing infinitesimal\ndeformations, the displacement of the elastic surface from its initial\nequilibrium position obeys a sixth-order (in space) initial boundary value\nproblem (IBVP). To solve this IBVP, we construct a set of odd and even\neigenfunctions that intrinsically satisfy the boundary conditions (BCs) of the\noriginal IBVP. These eigenfunctions are the solutions of a non-self-adjoint\nsixth-order eigenvalue problem (EVP). To use the eigenfunctions for series\nexpansions, we also construct and solve the adjoint EVP, leading to another set\nof even and odd eigenfunctions, which are orthogonal to the original set\n(biorthogonal). The eigenvalues of the adjoint EVP are the same as those of the\noriginal EVP, and we find accurate asymptotic formulas for them. Next,\nemploying the biorthogonal sets of eigenfunctions, a Petrov--Galerkin spectral\nmethod for sixth-order problems is proposed, which can also handle lower-order\nterms in the IBVP. The proposed method is tested on two model sixth-order BVPs,\nwhich admit exact solutions. We explicitly derive all the necessary formulas\nfor expanding the quantities that appear in the model problems into the set(s)\nof eigenfunctions.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across\ndiverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require\nreasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits\ntheir utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame\nsequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task\nattempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo\nRecursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose\nlong-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks\nwithin the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate\nreasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global\ncontext. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,\non diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa\nthat consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert\ntrajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong\nbaselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,\nframe-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We\nobserve that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each\ntimestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or\nnon-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the\nimplementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time\ncomplexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over\nbaselines.

    "abstract": "We establish central limit theorems for the Sample Average Approximation\n(SAA) method in discrete-time, finite-horizon Stochastic Optimal Control. Using\nthe dynamic programming principle and backward induction, we characterize the\nlimiting distributions of the SAA value functions. The asymptotic variance at\neach stage decomposes into two components: a current-stage variance arising\nfrom immediate randomness, and a propagated future variance accumulated from\nsubsequent stages. This decomposition clarifies how statistical uncertainty\npropagates backward through time. Our derivation relies on a stochastic\nequicontinuity condition, for which we provide sufficient conditions. We\nillustrate the variance decomposition using the classical Linear Quadratic\nRegulator (LQR) problem. Although its unbounded state and control spaces\nviolate the compactness assumptions of our framework, the LQR setting enables\nexplicit computation and visualization of both variance components.",

In this study, we use the AMBER architecture\nwith Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO) in place of the multi-head\nself-attention mechanism. While existing models rely on various forms of\nattention to capture global context, AMBER-AFNO achieves this through\nfrequency-domain mixing, enabling a drastic reduction in model complexity. This\ndesign reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 80% compared to\nUNETR++, while maintaining a FLOPs count comparable to other state-of-the-art\narchitectures. Model performance is evaluated on two benchmark 3D medical\ndatasets -- ACDC and Synapse -- using standard metrics such as Dice Similarity\nCoefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD), demonstrating that AMBER-AFNO\nachieves competitive or superior accuracy with significant gains in training\nefficiency, inference speed, and memory usage.",

    "abstract": "Regenerative braking (RB) significantly influences electric vehicle (EV)\ncar-following (CF) dynamics, yet traditional traffic-flow models rarely capture\nthese effects. We introduce a comprehensive empirical dataset comprising 197.5\nhours of driving data from 25 drivers across eight EV models to systematically\ninvestigate regen-induced CF behaviors. Two primary CF patterns emerge: (i)\nsteady-state scenarios where EVs use regenerative braking and subsequently\nre-accelerate to equilibrium speeds with larger spacing, and (ii) dynamic\nscenarios involving lead oscillations, characterized by a distinctive\nthree-phase CF process-regenerative deceleration, transitional plateau, and\nrapid re-acceleration. The paper's main contribution is the development of an\nanalytical framework that models these EV-specific CF behaviors and quantifies\ntheir impacts on traffic capacity. We derive closed-form expressions for the\nestablished $\\eta$ function from the literature, explicitly quantifying EV\ndriving deviations from stable CF defined by Newell's CF model and assessing\ntheir implications for roadway capacity. Validation against empirical data and\nsimulation confirm the model's accuracy ($R^2=0.96$) in replicating real-world\n$\\eta$ trajectories. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that increased RB\nintensity, prolonged transitions, and shorter reaction delays significantly\nraise values and cumulative capacity losses.

Beyond traditional\nsingle-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various\nobject classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade\nstandard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled\nBackdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured\ndisentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor\nthreats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image\nrepresentations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in\nthe embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By\nleveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes\nthe latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual\nprompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships\nbetween triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and\nobject representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the\ntrigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling\ntrigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with\nfeature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens\nin a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel\ntrigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering\ndeeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on\nCIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior\nto downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training\npipelines.",

    "abstract": "Modern cloud databases are shifting from converged architectures to storage\ndisaggregation, enabling independent scaling and billing of compute and\nstorage. However, cloud databases still rely on external, converged\ncoordination services (e.g., ZooKeeper) for their control planes. These\nservices are effectively lightweight databases optimized for low-volume\nmetadata. As the control plane scales in the cloud, this approach faces similar\nlimitations as converged databases did before storage disaggregation:\nscalability bottlenecks, low cost efficiency, and increased operational burden.\n  We propose to disaggregate the cluster coordination to achieve the same\nbenefits that storage disaggregation brought to modern cloud DBMSs. We present\nMarlin, a cloud-native coordination mechanism that fully embraces storage\ndisaggregation. Marlin eliminates the need for external coordination services\nby consolidating coordination functionality into the existing cloud-native\ndatabase it manages. To achieve failover without an external coordination\nservice, Marlin allows cross-node modifications on coordination states. To\nensure data consistency, Marlin employs transactions to manage both\ncoordination and application states and introduces MarlinCommit, an optimized\ncommit protocol that ensures strong transactional guarantees even under\ncross-node modifications. Our evaluations demonstrate that Marlin improves cost\nefficiency by up to 4.4x and reduces reconfiguration duration by up to 4.9x\ncompared to converged coordination solutions.",

However, explaining their predictions\nremains a challenging problem, especially due to the mismatch between the\ngraphs used during training and those encountered during explanation. Most\nexisting methods optimize soft edge masks on weighted graphs to highlight\nimportant substructures, but these graphs differ from the unweighted graphs on\nwhich GNNs are trained. This distributional shift leads to unreliable gradients\nand degraded explanation quality, especially when generating small, sparse\nsubgraphs. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative explanation\nframework which improves explanation robustness by aligning the model's\ntraining data distribution with the weighted graph distribution appeared during\nexplanation. Our method alternates between two phases: explanation subgraph\nidentification and model adaptation. It begins with a relatively large\nexplanation subgraph where soft mask optimization is reliable. Based on this\nsubgraph, we assign importance-aware edge weights to explanatory and\nnon-explanatory edges, and retrain the GNN on these weighted graphs. This\nprocess is repeated with progressively smaller subgraphs, forming an iterative\nrefinement procedure. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets\nusing different GNN backbones and explanation methods.

    "abstract": "By combining classical planning methods with large language models (LLMs),\nrecent research such as LLM+P has enabled agents to plan for general tasks\ngiven in natural language. However, scaling these methods to general-purpose\nservice robots remains challenging: (1) classical planning algorithms generally\nrequire a detailed and consistent specification of the environment, which is\nnot always readily available; and (2) existing frameworks mainly focus on\nisolated planning tasks, whereas robots are often meant to serve in long-term\ncontinuous deployments, and therefore must maintain a dynamic memory of the\nenvironment which can be updated with multi-modal inputs and extracted as\nplanning knowledge for future tasks. To address these two issues, this paper\nintroduces L3M+P (Lifelong LLM+P), a framework that uses an external knowledge\ngraph as a representation of the world state. The graph can be updated from\nmultiple sources of information, including sensory input and natural language\ninteractions with humans. L3M+P enforces rules for the expected format of the\nabsolute world state graph to maintain consistency between graph updates. At\nplanning time, given a natural language description of a task, L3M+P retrieves\ncontext from the knowledge graph and generates a problem definition for\nclassical planners. Evaluated on household robot simulators and on a real-world\nservice robot, L3M+P achieves significant improvement over baseline methods\nboth on accurately registering natural language state changes and on correctly\ngenerating plans, thanks to the knowledge graph retrieval and verification.",

    "abstract": "Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of\nmechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the\nrepresentation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent\nare different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it\npossible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way?\nSomewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable\nsubspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor\ndistance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an\nunsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in\nmany cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the\nsame abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to\n``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using\nknown circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and\ncircuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by\nfinding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing.\nViewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding\nmodel internals and building circuits.",

Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human\nmemory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a\nmajor energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance\nrequires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,\nEgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate\npower-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving\nsubstantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight\naudio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture\nfrom hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer\nopening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the\nQA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement\nQuestion-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated\nfirst-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure\nthat they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual\nunderstanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames\non average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components\n(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while\nachieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We\nbelieve this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction\nfor enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use\n-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their\nkeys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).",

    "abstract": "Academic publishing, integral to knowledge dissemination and scientific\nadvancement, increasingly faces threats from unethical practices such as\nunconsented authorship, gift authorship, author ambiguity, and undisclosed\nconflicts of interest. While existing infrastructures like ORCID effectively\ndisambiguate researcher identities, they fall short in enforcing explicit\nauthorship consent, accurately verifying contributor roles, and robustly\ndetecting conflicts of interest during peer review. To address these\nshortcomings, this paper introduces a decentralized framework leveraging\nSelf-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and blockchain technology. The proposed model\nuses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to\nsecurely verify author identities and contributions, reducing ambiguity and\nensuring accurate attribution. A blockchain-based trust registry records\nauthorship consent and peer-review activity immutably. Privacy-preserving\ncryptographic techniques, especially Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), support\nconflict-of-interest detection without revealing sensitive data. Verified\nauthorship metadata and consent records are embedded in publications,\nincreasing transparency. A stakeholder survey of researchers, editors, and\nreviewers suggests the framework improves ethical compliance and confidence in\nscholarly communication.

A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual\npre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining\nfrom scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution\nshifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this\npaper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this\ndistribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay\nand gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the\nLlama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100\nbillion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and\ngradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This\nconclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and\ndiversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose\nan efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues\nexperience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible\ncompute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay\nrates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a\nmore valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more\ncompute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of\nreplaying old examples.",

We present a new\nmeasurement of proton transparency (defined as the fraction of outgoing protons\nthat emerge without significant rescattering) using electron-nucleus scattering\ndata recorded by the CLAS detector at Jefferson Laboratory on helium, carbon,\nand iron targets. This analysis by the Electrons for Neutrinos ($e4\\nu$)\ncollaboration uses a new data-driven method to extract the transparency. It\ndefines transparency as the ratio of electron-scattering events with a detected\nproton to quasi-elastic electron-scattering events where a proton should have\nbeen knocked out. Our results are consistent with previous measurements that\ndetermined the transparency from the ratio of measured events to theoretically\npredicted events. We find that the GENIE event generator, which is widely used\nby oscillation experiments to simulate neutrino-nucleus interactions, needs to\nbetter describe both the nuclear ground state and proton rescattering in order\nto reproduce our measured transparency ratios, especially at lower proton\nmomenta.",

Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be\ndesigned to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system\nrevenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested\nvideos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache\nreplacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the\nreplacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache\nplacement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning.\nMotivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution\nfor revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a\nTransformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict\nmulti-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely\naccurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content\npopularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand\ndistribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results\nto find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This\nlatter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we\nthen transform to a integer linear program. Our extensive simulation results\ndemonstrate that (i) our FL solution delivers nearly identical performance to\nthat of the ideal centralized solution and outperforms other existing caching\nmethods, and (ii) our novel revenue optimization approach provides deeper\nsystem performance insights than traditional cache hit ratio (CHR)-based\noptimization approaches.",

Consequently, despite the\nincreasing number of everyday devices equipped with IMUs, the limited\nadaptability has seriously constrained the user experience to only using a few\nwell-explored device placements (e.g., wrist and ears). In this paper, we\nrethink IMU-based motion sensing by acknowledging that signals can be captured\nfrom any point on the human body. We introduce IMU over Continuous Coordinates\n(IMUCoCo), a novel framework that maps signals from a variable number of IMUs\nplaced on the body surface into a unified feature space based on their spatial\ncoordinates. These features can be plugged into downstream models for pose\nestimation and activity recognition. Our evaluations demonstrate that IMUCoCo\nsupports accurate pose estimation in a wide range of typical and atypical\nsensor placements. Overall, IMUCoCo supports significantly more flexible use of\nIMUs for motion sensing than the state-of-the-art, allowing users to place\ntheir sensors-laden devices according to their needs and preferences.

To address these challenges, we propose BVQC, a\nbackdoor-based watermarking technique for VQCs that preserves the original loss\nin typical execution settings, while deliberately increasing the loss to a\npredefined level during watermark extraction. Additionally, BVQC employs a\ngrouping algorithm to minimize the watermark task's interference with the base\ntask, ensuring optimal accuracy for the base task.

By generalizing the stress strain\nconstitutive relation to incorporate nonlocal spatial interactions and memory\neffects, we redefine a fractional Navier Stokes equation (fNSE). Regarding the\ninertial range scaling, the fractional Laplacian of order 1/3 and time\nfractional derivative capture non Markovian energy transfer. The one\ndimensional advection diffusion equation, for the purpose of initial validation\nand Burgers non-linear equation for the energy spectrum behavior are employed\nto investigate numerically the fNSE formulation. Moreover, the transient\none-dimensional heat equation and the Caputo derivative embedded Burgers\nequations are solved, demonstrating the solution behavior regarding temporal\nmemory effects. To simulate turbulent kinetic energy decay, we numerically\nsolve the incompressible NSE using a pseudo spectral method in a 3D periodic\ndomain, demonstrating the fNSE solution behavior.

We demonstrate how the fundamental theories of associative,\ncommutative, and Lie algebras can be fully recovered as categories of\nrepresentations of three archetypal operads: $\\mathsf{As}$, $\\mathsf{Com}$ and\n$\\mathsf{Lie}$ -- the so-called 'three graces' of algebra.\n  Following a deductive and self-contained approach, the notion of an operad is\ninitially presented in its classical form, as a single-object multicategory.\nSubsequently, alternative definitions -- namely, the partial and functorial\ndefinitions -- are provided. This framework allows for the extension of\nclassical algebraic notions, such as free objects and quotients, to the\noperadic context, thereby enabling operads to be formally presented through\ngenerators and relations.\n  The central result of this work is the rigorous proof of the correspondence\nbetween operads and algebras. We establish isomorphisms of categories between\nthe algebras over the operads $\\mathsf{As}$, $\\mathsf{Com}$ and $\\mathsf{Lie}$,\nand their respective classical counterparts.\n  This thesis thus highlights how the theory of operads offers a higher-level\nlanguage for algebra, encoding entire algebraic theories within single\nmathematical objects.

By incorporating pressure-\nand temperature-dependent elastic deformation into the structural evolution of\nthe planet, we demonstrate that radial contraction can lead to measurable\nincreases in surface escape velocity. We analytically derive a modified escape\ncondition and introduce a dimensionless suppression index Xi that quantifies\nthe extent to which internal mechanical response inhibits atmospheric loss.\nNumerical simulations across a wide parameter space show that volumetric strain\nvalues in the range 0.005 to 0.01 can enhance escape velocities by up to 10\npercent, leading to a reduction in energy-limited escape rates by over 50\npercent. When applied to warm mini-Neptunes such as GJ 1214b, K2-18b, and\nTOI-270c, the model successfully accounts for their persistent atmospheres\nwithout invoking exotic stellar conditions or chemical outliers.

We show that the Hubble parameter serves as\na time-dependent perturbation parameter, controlling the discrepancy between\nthe full system and its time-averaged counterpart. As this parameter decreases,\nboth systems converge to the same asymptotic behaviour. This enables the\nsuppression of oscillatory effects, significantly simplifying the dynamical\nanalysis. Finally, we identify conditions on the interaction parameters that\nensure the regularity of the system's evolution by preventing the emergence of\nsingularities.",

    "abstract": "Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving\nand intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video\nprocessing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and\nresponsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However,\nexisting methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous\ntriggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits\ntheir real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video\nstreams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal\nintervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant\ninformation to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we\nintegrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the\nanticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align\ncurrent observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust\nthe perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously\ntracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a\nstreaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory\nstructure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic\nretrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional\nKV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy\nand real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world\nstreaming scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Separation logic was conceived in order to make the verification of pointer\nprograms scalable to large systems and it has proven extremely effective. The\nkey idea is that programs typically access only small parts of memory, allowing\nfor local reasoning. This idea is implemented in separation logic by extending\nfirst-order logic with separating connectives, which inspect local regions of\nmemory. It turns that this approach not only applies to pointer programs, but\nalso to programs involving other resource structures. Various theories have\nbeen put forward to extract and apply the ideas of separation logic more\nbroadly. This resulted in algebraic abstractions of memory and many variants of\nseparation logic for, e.g., concurrent programs and stochastic processes.\nHowever, none of the existing approaches formulate the combination of\nfirst-order logic with separating connectives in a theory that could\nimmediately yield program logics for different resources. In this paper, we\npropose a framework based on the idea that separation logic can obtained by\nmaking first-order logic resource-aware. First-order logic can be understood in\nterms of categorical logic, specifically fibrations. Our contribution is to\nmake these resource-aware by developing categorical logic internally in\ncategories of sheaves, which is what we call sheafeology. The role of sheaves\nis to model views on resources, through which resources can be localised and\ncombined, which enables the scalability promised by separation logic. We\ncontribute constructions of an internal fibration in sheaf categories that\nmodels predicates on resources, and that admits first-order and separating\nconnectives. Thereby, we attain a general framework of separation logic for\ngeneric resources, a claim we substantiate by instantiating our framework to\nvarious memory models and random variables.",

    "abstract": "Missing data in financial panels presents a critical obstacle, undermining\nasset-pricing models and reducing the effectiveness of investment strategies.\nSuch panels are often inherently multi-dimensional, spanning firms, time, and\nfinancial variables, which adds complexity to the imputation task. Conventional\nimputation methods often fail by flattening the data's multidimensional\nstructure, struggling with heterogeneous missingness patterns, or overfitting\nin the face of extreme data sparsity. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce an Adaptive, Cluster-based Temporal smoothing tensor completion\nframework (ACT-Tensor) tailored for severely and heterogeneously missing\nmulti-dimensional financial data panels. ACT-Tensor incorporates two key\ninnovations: a cluster-based completion module that captures cross-sectional\nheterogeneity by learning group-specific latent structures; and a temporal\nsmoothing module that proactively removes short-lived noise while preserving\nslow-moving fundamental trends. Extensive experiments show that ACT-Tensor\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of imputation\naccuracy across a range of missing data regimes, including extreme sparsity\nscenarios. To assess its practical financial utility, we evaluate the imputed\ndata with an asset-pricing pipeline tailored for tensor-structured financial\ndata. Results show that ACT-Tensor not only reduces pricing errors but also\nsignificantly improves risk-adjusted returns of the constructed portfolio.\nThese findings confirm that our method delivers highly accurate and informative\nimputations, offering substantial value for financial decision-making.",

However, the applicability of these approaches to\nreal-world scenarios suffers from two key limitations. First, previous work\nused fixed search times in the informational intent condition -- a stark\ncontrast to visual search, which naturally terminates when the target is found.\nSecond, methods incorporating EEG measurements addressed prediction scenarios\nthat require ground truth training data from the target user, which is\nimpractical in many use cases. We address these limitations by making the first\npublicly available EEG and eye-tracking dataset for navigational vs.\ninformational intent recognition, where the user determines search times. We\npresent the first method for cross-user prediction of search intents from EEG\nand eye-tracking recordings and reach 84.5% accuracy in leave-one-user-out\nevaluations -- comparable to within-user prediction accuracy (85.5%) but\noffering much greater flexibility",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of\nweb agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin\nto human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire\nsufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore,\nwe decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge\ncontent learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose\nWeb-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and\nProcedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the\nagent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two\nknowledge types, representing the \"what\" of learning. Conversely, cognitive\nprocesses correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining\nthe \"how\" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we\nconstruct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world\nwebsites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web\nagent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the \"nouns\" upon\nwhich comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason\nand act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through\na novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing\nand training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation\nreveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in\ngeneralizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable\nrigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation\nsuite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated\nknowledge domains and cognitive capabilities.

Blockchain appears to be one of the best solutions\nfor managing massive heterogeneous devices while achieving advanced data\nsecurity and data reputation, particularly in the field of large-scale IoT\n(Internet of Things) networks. Despite the numerous advantages, there are still\nchallenges while deploying IoT applications on blockchain systems due to the\nlimited storage, power, and computing capability of IoT devices, and some of\nthese problems are caused by the consensus algorithm, which plays a significant\nrole in blockchain systems by ensuring overall system reliability and\nrobustness.

Aiming at some critical problems in the existing consensus algorithms,\nthis paper proposes the Efficient Byzantine Reputation-based Consensus (EBRC)\nmechanism to resolve the issues raised above. In comparison to traditional\nalgorithms, we reinvented ways to evaluate node reliability and robustness and\nmanage active nodes.

To close this gap, we, for the\nfirst time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations\nduring free visual search in realistic scenes.

A temporal context resampler learns\npredefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using\ntransformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a\nteacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context\nassigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The\nteacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy\nmap to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the\nstudent to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial\ndependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded\ntokens based on high-dependency context.

    "abstract": "Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a\nfundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by\nrelying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests\nthat become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics.\nThis paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to\npattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and\nlearnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal\ngraph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce\nTemporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that\noperationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal\nsignatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical\ndescriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time\nseries, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen\ndynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established\nmethods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing\nthe discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for\nuncovering causal structures in complex systems.",

We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event\nrepresentation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse\ntasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous\nmethods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T\nscaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the\nlocal feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial\nand temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are\napplied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute\nefficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to\nlearn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which\nenables standard vision models to process event data without architecture\nchange. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent\nout-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks\nand 10 datasets (Fig.1).

    "abstract": "With advances in scientific computing, computer experiments are increasingly\nused for optimizing complex systems. However, for modern applications, e.g.,\nthe optimization of nuclear physics detectors, each experiment run can require\nhundreds of CPU hours, making the optimization of its black-box simulator over\na high-dimensional space a challenging task. Given limited runs at inputs\n$\\mathbf{x}_1, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_n$, the best solution from these evaluated\ninputs can be far from optimal, particularly as dimensionality increases.\nExisting black-box methods, however, largely employ this ''pick-the-winner''\n(PW) solution, which leads to mediocre optimization performance. To address\nthis, we propose a new Black-box Optimization via Marginal Means (BOMM)\napproach. The key idea is a new estimator of a global optimizer $\\mathbf{x}^*$\nthat leverages the so-called marginal mean functions, which can be efficiently\ninferred with limited runs in high dimensions. Unlike PW, this estimator can\nselect solutions beyond evaluated inputs for improved optimization performance.\nAssuming the objective function follows a generalized additive model with\nunknown link function and under mild conditions, we prove that the BOMM\nestimator not only is consistent for optimization, but also has an optimization\nrate that tempers the ''curse-of-dimensionality'' faced by existing methods,\nthus enabling better performance as dimensionality increases. We present a\npractical framework for implementing BOMM using the transformed additive\nGaussian process surrogate model. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\nBOMM in numerical experiments and an application on neutrino detector\noptimization in nuclear physics.",

Recent advances move beyond\ndiscrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward\ncontinuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential\nEquations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the\nunderlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,\nextrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the\ndynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably\nunder distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as\nthe continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics\nsolely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories\ntoward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To\nachieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and\n(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain\nrich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to\nprocess past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to\nextract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics.\nDuring training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future\ntrajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal\ncurrent action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon\noptimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions,\nindicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable\nperformance.

Instead, it adjusts to the actions actually taken (similar\nto a vehicle navigation system). We show how to compute a runtime consultant\nfor common value functions used in verification, and that almost all have a\nruntime consultant that works in constant time. We also develop consultants for\n$\\omega$-regular properties, under both their classical Boolean semantics and\ntheir recently proposed quantitative interpretation.",

The framework employs\nspecialized expert networks for diagnosis-specific pathological patterns while\nshared experts model common structural features across the cognitive continuum.\nA two-stage training protocol combines SimMIM pretraining with multi-task\nfine-tuning for joint optimization. Comprehensive evaluation across six\ndatasets comprising 12,037 T1-weighted sMRI scans demonstrates superior\nperformance: 95.13% accuracy for three-class NC-MCI-AD classification and\n99.15% for binary NC-AD classification, representing improvements of 4.69% and\n0.55% over state-of-the-art approaches.

However, these methods require\nsubstantial memory to store a large number of implicit features. This work\npresents a hybrid buffering strategy. For inter-frame coding, it buffers one\npreviously decoded frame as the explicit temporal reference and a small number\nof learned features as implicit temporal reference.

    "abstract": "This paper aims at devising the shape of the external electromagnetic field\nwhich drives the spin dynamics of radical pairs to quantum coherent state\nthrough maximization of the triplet-singlet yield in biochemical reactions. The\nmodel is a Schr\\\"{o}dinger system with spin Hamiltonians given by the sum of\nZeeman interaction and hyperfine coupling interaction terms. We introduce a\none-parameter family of optimal control problems by coupling the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger system to a control field through filtering equations for the\nelectromagnetic field. Fr\\'echet differentiability and the Pontryagin Maximum\nPrinciple in Hilbert space is proved, and the bang-bang structure of the\noptimal control is established. A new iterative Pontryagin Maximum Principle\n(IPMP) method for the identification of the bang-bang optimal control is\ndeveloped. Numerical simulations based on IPMP and the gradient projection\nmethod (GPM) in Hilbert spaces are pursued, and the convergence, stability and\nthe regularization effect are demonstrated. Comparative analysis of filtering\nwith regular optimal electromagnetic field versus non-filtering with bang-bang\noptimal field ({\\it Abdulla et al, Quantum Sci. Technol., {\\bf9}, 4, 2024})\ndemonstrates the change of the maxima of the singlet yield is less than 1\\%.\nThe results open a venue for a potential experimental work for the\nmagnetoreception as a manifestation of quantum biological phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on centralized\narchitectures and often suffer from poor alignment between the input task and\ntheir fixed visual encoding modules, which limits performance on diverse and\ndynamic visual tasks. With the increasing deployment of resource-efficient\nmodels on edge devices in wireless networks, a new opportunity emerges to\ndynamically use distributed vision experts for improved MLLM inference quality.\nTo enable this, we propose M3LLM, where the Model Context Protocol (MCP)\ncoordinates a mixture of vision experts to achieve distributed MLLMs.\nSpecifically, MCP is an open protocol that structures the input task context\ninto interpretable representations, enabling wireless network-aware\ncoordination between the central model backbone and edge-hosted vision experts.\nBased on the MCP representation, M3LLM formulates vision expert routing as a\njoint optimization problem that balances task-expert semantic compatibility and\nchannel performance. To solve the resulting gradient conflicts, we develop a\ndual-stream Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm with decoupled reward signals and\nintroduce an Adaptive Stability Enhancement Module (ASEM) based on hierarchical\nBayesian modeling to ensure effective routing. Experiments show that M3LLM\nimproves task accuracy, reduces communication cost, and enhances expert routing\nadaptability under dynamic wireless network conditions.",

Existing accelerator-generation tools, such as AMD's\nFINN, do not adequately address extreme resource limitations faced by IoT\nendpoints operating in bare-metal environments without an operating system\n(OS). To overcome these constraints, we propose MARVEL-an automated, end-to-end\nframework that generates custom RISC-V ISA extensions tailored to specific DNN\nmodel classes, with a primary focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nThe proposed method profiles high-level DNN representations in Python and\ngenerates an ISA-extended RISC-V core with associated compiler tools for\nefficient deployment. The flow leverages (1) Apache TVM for translating\nhigh-level Python-based DNN models into optimized C code, (2) Synopsys ASIP\nDesigner for identifying compute-intensive kernels, modeling, and generating a\ncustom RISC-V and (3) Xilinx Vivado for FPGA implementation. Beyond a model\nclass specific RISC-V, our approach produces an optimized bare-metal C\nimplementation, eliminating the need for an OS or extensive software\ndependencies. Unlike conventional deployment pipelines relying on\nTensorFlow/PyTorch runtimes, our solution enables seamless execution in highly\nresource-constrained environments. We evaluated the flow on popular DNN models\nsuch as LeNet-5*, MobileNetV1, ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2 and DenseNet121\nusing the Synopsys trv32p3 RISC-V core as a baseline.

Our observations on pretokenization strategies significantly improve\nmodel performance, and our data composition algorithm reduces the average\ntoken-to-word ratio by approximately 6% with respect to the conventional data\nrandomization approach. Our tokenizer achieves more than 40% improvement on\naverage token-to-word ratio against stateof-the-art multilingual Indic models.\nThis improvement yields measurable gains in both model performance and\ninference speed.

This approach reimagines core quantum concepts: superposition becomes a\nform of structured ambiguity; collapse is reframed as an introspective\ncontraction; and entanglement is modeled as semantic resonance across streams\nof qualia. Drawing on insights from nominalist philosophy and oversight\ntheoretic limits in AI, we argue that the observer paradox in quantum mechanics\nreflects not an ontological lacuna, but a linguistic one: the absence of a\nformal vocabulary for modeling first person structure. QAL introduces such a\nvocabulary, providing a morphodynamic framework that embeds the observer within\nthe system and replaces abstract projection with endogenous transformation.

    "abstract": "The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial\ntechnical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of\ntemporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the\nMSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of\nsigner-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of\nCSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,\ncentered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,\nand an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled\nfeature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate\ncommunicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating\nDBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel\nCSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer\ndesign of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal\ndependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for\nthe spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology\nachieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on\nthe development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd\nplace ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the\nefficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the\nConformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be\nsuccessfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in\nkeypoint-based CSLR.",

When virtual and real objects collide, either no\nsound or a generic sound is played. Both lead to an incongruent multisensory\nexperience, reducing interaction and object realism. Unlike in Virtual Reality\n(VR) and games, where predefined scenes and interactions allow for the playback\nof pre-recorded sound samples, AR requires real-time sound synthesis that\ndynamically adapts to novel contexts and objects to provide audiovisual\ncongruence during interaction. To enhance real-virtual object interactions in\nAR, we propose a framework for context-aware sounds using methods from computer\nvision to recognize and segment the materials of real objects. The material's\nphysical properties and the impact dynamics of the interaction are used to\ngenerate material-based sounds in real-time using physical modelling synthesis.\nIn a user study with 24 participants, we compared our congruent material-based\nsounds to a generic sound effect, mirroring the current standard of\nnon-context-aware sounds in AR applications. The results showed that\nmaterial-based sounds led to significantly more realistic sonic interactions.\nMaterial-based sounds also enabled participants to distinguish visually similar\nmaterials with significantly greater accuracy and confidence.

While effective for multi-task integration, this paradigm\nintroduces a critical yet underexplored challenge: how to attribute and protect\nthe intellectual property (IP) of individual experts after merging. We propose\nRouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the\ndesign of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific\nexperts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs.\nTo capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two\ncomplementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the\nintensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF),\ncharacterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each\nexpert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and\nlightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce\na similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between\na suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse\ntasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields\nhigh similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones.\nMoreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert\nreplacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning,\npruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness.\nOur work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly\napplicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging.",

    "abstract": "This article reviews theoretical methods for analyzing Floquet engineering\n(FE) phenomena in open (dissipative) quantum or classical systems, with an\nemphasis on our recent results. In many theoretical studies for FE in quantum\nsystems, researchers have used the Floquet theory for closed (isolated) quantum\nsystems, that is based on the Schr\\\"odinger equation. However, if we consider\nthe FE in materials driven by an oscillating field like a laser, a weak but\nfinite interaction between a target system and an environment (bath) is\ninevitable. In this article, we describe these periodically driven dissipative\nsystems by means of the quantum master (GKSL) equation. In particular, we show\nthat a nonequilibrium steady state appears after a long driving due to the\nbalance between the energy injection by the driving field and the release to\nthe bath. In addition to quantum systems, if we try to simply apply Floquet\ntheory to periodically driven classical systems, it failed because the equation\nof motion (EOM) is generally nonlinear, and the Floquet theorem can be applied\nonly to linear differential equations. Instead, by considering the distribution\nfunction of the classical variables (i.e., Fokker-Planck equation), one can\narrive at the effective EOM for the driven systems. We illustrate the essence\nof the Floquet theory for classical systems. On top of fundamentals of the\nFloquet theory, we review representative examples of FEs (Floquet topological\ninsulators, inverse Faraday effects in metals and magnets, Kapitza pendulum,\netc.) and dissipation-assisted FEs.",

    "abstract": "All optical wavelength converters (AOWCs) that can effectively and flexibly\nswitch optical signals between different wavelength channels are essential\nelements in future optical fiber communications and quantum information\nsystems. A promising strategy for achieving high-performance AOWCs is to\nleverage strong three-wave mixing processes in second-order nonlinear\nnanophotonic devices, specifically thin-film periodically poled lithium niobate\n(TF-PPLN) waveguides. By exploiting the advantages of sub-wavelength light\nconfinement and dispersion engineering compared with their bulk counterparts,\nTF-PPLN waveguides provide a viable route for realizing highly efficient and\nbroadband wavelength conversion. Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely on\na single TF-PPLN device to perform both frequency doubling of the telecom pump\nand the wavelength conversion process, resulting in significant crosstalk\nbetween adjacent signal channels. Here, we address this challenge by\ndemonstrating a two-stage TF-PPLN nonlinear photonic circuit that integrates a\nsecond-harmonic generation module, a signal wavelength conversion module, and\nmultiple adiabatic directional coupler-based pump filters, on a single chip. By\ndecoupling the two nonlinear processes and leveraging the high pump-filtering\nextinction ratio, we achieve low-crosstalk AOWC with a side-channel suppression\nratio exceeding 25 dB, substantially surpassing the performance of single-stage\ndevices. Furthermore, our device exhibits an ultra-broad conversion bandwidth\nof 110 nm and a relatively high conversion efficiency of -15.6 dB, making it an\nattractive solution for future photonic systems. The two-stage AOWC design\nshows promise for low-noise phase-sensitive amplification and quantum frequency\nconversion in future classical and quantum photonic systems.",

Previous works on transfers from circular\nlow Earth orbit to distant prograde orbits mainly focused on construction\nmethods based on dynamical structures, lacking a comprehensive analysis of the\nsolution space of this transfer scenario. This paper investigates the solution\nspace and identifies families of transfers from a 167 km circular low Earth\norbit to a 1:1 distant prograde orbit. In particular, grid search and\ntrajectory continuation are performed to construct these transfer trajectories.\nInitial guesses of the transfers are selected in the 1:1 distant prograde orbit\nthrough a backward propagation strategy and are then corrected to satisfy\nspecified constraints. Based on the obtained solutions, a linear predictor is\nderived to predict more feasible solutions and a predictor-corrector\ncontinuation method is used to extend the solution space. Twelve transfer\nfamilies are identified, most of which are new or previously underexplored. The\ndistributions of construction parameters and transfer characteristics of these\ntwelve families are analyzed and discussed, showing which families are\napplicable to which types of specific practical missions.

Faults in\nprotocol behavior can lead to vulnerabilities and system failures, especially\nin real-time and mission-critical applications. A common approach to protocol\ntesting involves constructing Markovian models that capture the state\ntransitions and expected behaviors of the protocol. However, building such\nmodels typically requires significant domain expertise and manual effort,\nmaking the process time-consuming and difficult to scale across diverse\nprotocols and implementations.\n  We propose a novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to\nautomatically generate sequences for testing network protocol implementations.\nOur approach begins by defining the full set of possible protocol states, from\nwhich the LLM selects a subset to model the target implementation. Using this\nstate-based model, we prompt the LLM to generate code that produces sequences\nof states. This program serves as a protocol-specific sequences generator.

    "abstract": "Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often\ninclude sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns.\nDifferentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating\nsynthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a\npredefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to\nachieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To\nmitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,\nDataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage\nefficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with\nDP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without\ncompromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods\nsuffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on\nnoisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the\ninefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive\nnoise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples\nsampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality\nby mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative\nsubspace.

To\nexplicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel\nDynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch\nDecomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale\nRouting MoE block (ASR-MoE).

TIB then jointly models intra-patch,\ninter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed\nrepresentations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a\nmulti-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained\nrepresentations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature\nextraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways.

This paper proposes\na multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first\ntime integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search\nmechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and\nhypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating\nscientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an\ninitial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior\nbeliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It\nthen employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature\nevidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'\ntheorem.

In consequence, there\nhas been a surge in means for avatar-based personalization, ranging from\nclassic human representations to animals, food items, and more. However, using\navatars also has drawbacks. Depending on the human-likeness of the avatar and\nthe corresponding disparities between the avatar and the original expresser,\navatars may elicit discomfort or even hinder effective nonverbal communication\nby distorting emotion perception. This study examines the relationship between\nthe human-likeness of virtual avatars and emotion perception for Ekman's six\n\"basic emotions\". Research reveals that avatars with varying degrees of\nhuman-likeness have distinct effects on emotion perception. High human-likeness\navatars, such as human avatars, tend to elicit more negative emotional\nresponses from users, a phenomenon that is consistent with the concept of\nUncanny Valley in aesthetics, which suggests that closely resembling humans can\nprovoke negative emotional responses. Conversely, a raccoon avatar and a shark\navatar, known as cuteness, which exhibit moderate human similarity in this\nstudy, demonstrate a positive influence on emotion perception. Our initial\nresults suggest that the human-likeness of avatars is an important factor for\nemotion perception. The results from the follow-up study further suggest that\nthe cuteness of avatars and their natural facial status may also play a\nsignificant role in emotion perception and elicitation.

    "abstract": "We study the Levine hat problem, a classic combinatorial puzzle introduced by\nLionel Levine in 2010. This problem involves a game in which $n \\geq 2$\nplayers, each seeing an infinite stack of hats on each of their teammates'\nheads but not on their own, must simultaneously guess the index of a black hat\non their own stack. If one of the players fails to do so, the team loses\ncollectively. The players must therefore come up with a good strategy before\nthe game starts. While the optimal winning probability $V_{n}$ remains unknown\neven for $n=2$, we make three key advances. First, we develop a novel geometric\nframework for representing strategies through measurable functions, providing a\nnew expression of $V_{n}$ and a unified treatment of the game for finite and\nfor infinite stacks via integral formulations. Secondly, we construct a new\nstrategy $K_{5}$ that reaches the conjectured optimal probability of victory :\n$0.35$. We also show that $K_{5}$ is part of a larger class of strategies that\nallow us to improve current bounds and resolve conjectured inequalities.\nFinally, we introduce and entirely solve a continuous generalization of the\nproblem, demonstrating that extending to uncountable hat stacks increases the\noptimal winning probability to exactly $1/2$. This generalization naturally\nleads to a broader and smoother strategic framework, within which we also\ndescribe how to compute optimal responses to a range of strategies.",

We propose two potential difficulty generating factors targeting how\na language is presented to students: representation in natural language and as\na verbose set notation. Furthermore, we propose two factors targeting the\nstructure of the given context-free language: nesting of constructs and\ninsertion of multiplicities.\n  We conducted a controlled experiment using within-subject randomization in an\ninteractive learning system, testing the proposed difficulty factors for\nconstructing context-free grammars and pushdown automata. Our results suggest\nthat three of the four factors significantly influence students' objective\nperformance in solving exercises for constructing context-free grammars, while\nstudents' perceived difficulties only partly align with the objective\nperformance measures. The findings for pushdown automata tasks differed\nmarkedly from those for context-free grammar tasks. Our variations either had\nnegligible effects or, in some cases, even reduced difficulty.

    "abstract": "The problem of embedding a set of objects into a low-dimensional Euclidean\nspace based on a matrix of pairwise dissimilarities is fundamental in data\nanalysis, machine learning, and statistics. However, the assumptions of many\nstandard analytical methods are violated when the input dissimilarities fail to\nsatisfy metric or Euclidean axioms. We present the mathematical and statistical\nfoundations of Topolow, a physics-inspired, gradient-free optimization\nframework for such embedding problems. Topolow is conceptually related to\nforce-directed graph drawing algorithms but is fundamentally distinguished by\nits goal of quantitative metric reconstruction. It models objects as particles\nin a physical system, and its novel optimization scheme proceeds through\nsequential, stochastic pairwise interactions, which circumvents the need to\ncompute a global gradient and provides robustness against convergence to local\noptima, especially for sparse data. Topolow maximizes the likelihood under a\nLaplace error model, robust to outliers and heterogeneous errors, and properly\nhandles censored data. Crucially, Topolow does not require the input\ndissimilarities to be metric, making it a robust solution for embedding\nnon-metric measurements into a valid Euclidean space, thereby enabling the use\nof standard analytical tools. We demonstrate the superior performance of\nTopolow compared to standard Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) methods in\nreconstructing the geometry of sparse and non-Euclidean data. This paper\nformalizes the algorithm, first introduced as Topolow in the context of\nantigenic mapping in (Arhami and Rohani, 2025) (open access), with emphasis on\nits metric embedding and mathematical properties for a broader audience.

While many RSFMs have been pretrained\nwith massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack\nof the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral\nimagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be\neffectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring\nextensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed\nSpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt\nexisting RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to\nhandle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain\ngeneralization performance. In the first stage, we employ a\nmasked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to\nextract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions.\nSimultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA)\nthat dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing\nlayer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the\nsecond stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the\nfirst stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with\nhigh-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial\nattributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase\nadaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from\nnew regions or seasons.

In unmanned aerial\nvehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex\nUAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often\nlead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing\nmethods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking\ntheir spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking\nperformance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance\nand motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency\n(AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically,\nthe AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance\nof appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity\nassociation. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks\nthrough appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions,\nthereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive\nexperiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and\nVT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art\nmethods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.",

    "abstract": "We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral properties of\nbosons harmonically confined in a quasi-2D plane and interacting via repulsive\nGaussian potential. We consider the lowest $100$ energy levels for systems of\n$N=12, 16$ and $20$ bosons both for the moderate and strong interaction regimes\nfor the non-rotating ($L_{z}=0$) and the rotating single-vortex state\n($L_{z}=N$). For higher angular momenta, $L_{z}=2N$ and $L_{z}=3N$, only the\nstrong interaction regime is considered. While the nearest-neighbor spacing\ndistribution (NNSD) $P(s)$ and the ratios of consecutive level spacings\ndistribution $P(r)$ are used to study the short-range correlations, the\nDyson-Mehta $\\Delta_3$ statistic and the level number variance $\\Sigma^2(L)$\nare used to examine the long-range correlations. In the moderate interaction\nregime when the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, the\nnon-rotating system exhibits a Poisson distribution, characteristic of the\nregular energy spectra. In the strong interaction regime when the interaction\nenergy is comparable to the trap energy, the non-rotating system exhibits\nchaotic behavior signified by GOE distribution. Furthermore, in the rotating\ncase for the single-vortex state ($L_{z} = N$) in the moderate interaction\nregime, the system exhibits signatures of weak chaos with some degree of\nregularity in the energy-level spectra. However, in the strong interaction\nregime for the rotating case with $L_{z} = N$, $2N$ and $3N$, the system\nexhibits strong chaotic behavior. The rotation is found to contribute to an\nenhancement of chaotic behavior in the system for both the moderate and the\nstrong interaction regimes. Our results of NNSD analysis are supported by the\nanalysis of the ratios of consecutive level spacings distribution $P(r)$.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged\nby real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional\ndispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque\nand require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise\nadaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct\napplication is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the\nlong-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization\nof expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose\nReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by\nequipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to\nanalyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and\ndistill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic\nExperience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final\ndecision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments\nshow that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct\nLLM baselines, securing a 71.35\\% Win Rate and a 2.755\\% Relative Percentage\nDeviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual\nheuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified\npitfalls. Additionally, ReflecSched performs on par with the best heuristic\ntailored to each instance across all problem cases.",

Recent advances in\nvisual-language mapping have enabled generalizable semantic representations by\nleveraging vision-language models (VLMs).

    "abstract": "The rotational evolution of a strongly magnetized neutron star (NS),\naccreting or isolated, is driven by external torques of different nature. In\naddition to the torques, even the tiniest deformations of the NS crust can\naffect its rotation through asymmetries in its inertia tensor. Several factors\nmay be responsible for the deformations, including strong magnetic fields,\ninternal stresses, or local heating. The main effect produced by the\ndeformations is the so-called free precession: the motion of the rotational\naxis with respect to the crust. We consider the evolution of a triaxially\ndeformed isolated NS with a strong dipolar magnetic field for a broad range of\nparameters, taking into account the magnetic field decay. We show that the\ncombination of pulsar torques and free precession results in a considerable\nbroadening of the distribution of magnetic obliquity angles (the angle between\nthe magnetic and rotational axes) and creates a population of objects where the\nrotational axis does not align with the magnetic axis at all but enters a\nlimit-cycle regime. The combination of free precession and magnetic torques can\nalso explain the observed distribution in pulsar braking indices by creating a\nperiodic oscillation in the magnetic obliquity.",

We emphasise the\ncritical need for more complete yield coverage of the binary nucleosynthesis\nand evolution, without which the ability to make accurate predictions on the\ntrue role of binarity on GCE calculations is hamstrung. We also provide clear\nguidelines for future stellar modelling works to ensure their results are\nmaximally useful to the wider community.

We study the effect of varying the binary\nmixture and accretion efficiencies, and consider a range of models for the\ntreatment of accreted material on the secondary in detail. In the absence of\ndetailed binary yields for the secondary, we put forth a model for the\ncomposition of accreted material that preserves the signature of the primary's\nnuclear processing within the post-mass-transfer secondary yields. Among the\nbinary parameters, we find that the binary fraction, which determines the ratio\nof binary and single star systems, has the most significant effect on the\neffective stellar yields, with widespread impact across most isotopes.

    "abstract": "The growth of the number of connected devices and network densification is\ndriving an increasing demand for radio network resources, particularly Radio\nFrequency (RF) spectrum. Given the dynamic and complex nature of contemporary\nwireless environments, characterized by a wide variety of devices and multiple\nRATs, spectrum sensing is envisioned to become a building component of future\n6G, including as a component within O-RAN or digital twins. However, the\ncurrent SotA research for RAT classification predominantly revolves around\nsupervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach that require\nextensive labeled dataset. Due to this, it is unclear how existing models\nbehave in environments for which training data is unavailable thus leaving open\nquestions regarding their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we\npropose a new spectrum sensing workflow in which the model training does not\nrequire any prior knowledge of the RATs transmitting in that area (i.e. no\nlabelled data) and the class assignment can be easily done through manual\nmapping. Furthermore, we adapt a SSL deep clustering architecture capable of\nautonomously extracting spectrum features from raw 1D Fast Fourier Transform\n(FFT) data. We evaluate the proposed architecture on three real-world datasets\nfrom three European cities, in the 868 MHz, 2.4 GHz and 5.9 GHz bands\ncontaining over 10 RATs and show that the developed model achieves superior\nperformance by up to 35 percentage points with 22% fewer trainable parameters\nand 50% less floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) compared to an SotA\nAE-based reference architecture.",

    "abstract": "The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) promises to transform financial\nmarkets by enabling fractional ownership, global accessibility, and\nprogrammable settlement of traditionally illiquid assets such as real estate,\nprivate credit, and government bonds. While technical progress has been rapid,\nwith over \\$25 billion in tokenized RWAs brought on-chain as of 2025, liquidity\nremains a critical bottleneck. This paper investigates the gap between\ntokenization and tradability, drawing on recent academic research and market\ndata from platforms such as RWA.xyz. We document that most RWA tokens exhibit\nlow trading volumes, long holding periods, and limited investor participation,\ndespite their potential for 24/7 global markets. Through case studies of\ntokenized real estate, private credit, and tokenized treasury funds, we present\nempirical liquidity observations that reveal low transfer activity, limited\nactive address counts, and minimal secondary trading for most tokenized asset\nclasses. Next, we categorize the structural barriers to liquidity, including\nregulatory gating, custodial concentration, whitelisting, valuation opacity,\nand lack of decentralized trading venues. Finally, we propose actionable\npathways to improve liquidity, ranging from hybrid market structures and\ncollateral-based liquidity to transparency enhancements and compliance\ninnovation. Our findings contribute to the growing discourse on digital asset\nmarket microstructure and highlight that realizing the liquidity potential of\nRWAs requires coordinated progress across legal, technical, and institutional\ndomains.",

Our experiments\nshow that, as the model scales in the parameter space, the expression leakage\nreduces within the same LLM family. On the other hand, we demonstrate that\nexpression leakage mitigation requires specific care during the model building\nprocess, and cannot be mitigated by prompting. In addition, our experiments\nindicate that, when negative sentiment is injected in the prompt, it disrupts\nthe generation process more than the positive sentiment, causing a higher\nexpression leakage rate.",

However, when the data distribution is a mixture of\ncontinuous and discrete components, the resulting methods are inconsistent in\ntheory and perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we point out that a minor\nmodification of existing methods for nonparametric density (functional)\nestimation can allow us to fully remove this assumption while retaining nearly\nidentical theoretical guarantees and improved empirical performance. Our\napproach is very simple: data points that appear exactly once are likely to\noriginate from the continuous component, whereas repeated observations are\nindicative of the discrete part. Leveraging this observation, we modify\nexisting estimators for a broad class of functionals of the continuous\ncomponent of the mixture; this modification is a \"wrapper\" in the sense that\nthe user can use any underlying method of their choice for continuous density\nfunctional estimation. Our modifications deliver consistency without requiring\nknowledge of the discrete support, the mixing proportion, and without imposing\nadditional assumptions beyond those needed in the absence of the discrete part.\nThus, various theorems and existing software packages can be made automatically\nmore robust, with absolutely no additional price when the data is not truly\nmixed.",

The recently\nproposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit\nscene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction\nin autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational\ncosts involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a\nsignificant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update\nmethod for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components:\nMultimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and\nGaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is\ngenerated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently,\nduring the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the\ncurrent LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform\ntargeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We\nestablish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to\nquantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that\nLT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling\ncommon environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by\ntaking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian\nis able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update\nstrategies that reconstruct maps from scratch.

    "abstract": "In hand object reorientation provides capability for dexterous manipulation,\nrequiring robust control policies to manage diverse object geometries, maintain\nstable grasps, and execute precise complex orientation trajectories. However,\nprior works focus on single objects or simple geometries and struggle to\ngeneralize to complex shapes. In this work, we introduce DexReMoE (Dexterous\nReorientation Mixture-of-Experts), in which multiple expert policies are\ntrained for different complex shapes and integrated within a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) framework, making the approach capable of generalizing across a wide\nrange of objects. Additionally, we incorporate object category information as\nprivileged inputs to enhance shape representation. Our framework is trained in\nsimulation using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluated on novel\nout-of-distribution objects in the most challenging scenario of reorienting\nobjects held in the air by a downward-facing hand. In terms of the average\nconsecutive success count, DexReMoE achieves a score of 19.5 across a diverse\nset of 150 objects. In comparison to the baselines, it also enhances the\nworst-case performance, increasing it from 0.69 to 6.05. These results\nunderscore the scalability and adaptability of the DexReMoE framework for\ngeneral-purpose in-hand reorientation.",

    "abstract": "Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing\nthe heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is\nhindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,\ncaused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.\nSecond, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease\nprevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.\nThird, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,\noften leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the\nreliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these\nissues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces\nuncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and\ncontextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair\nResampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects\ninformative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution\nuncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances\nthe modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting\nunderrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent\nconditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter\nvalidates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the\ncurrent image, effectively suppressing hallucinations.

Tested on a privacy-preserving\ndataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit\nAuthority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our\nresults demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive\nvalue for crowd estimation.

    "abstract": "We study the regret minimization problem in the novel setting of generalized\nkernelized bandits (GKBs), where we optimize an unknown function $f^*$\nbelonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) having access to samples\ngenerated by an exponential family (EF) noise model whose mean is a non-linear\nfunction $\\mu(f^*)$. This model extends both kernelized bandits (KBs) and\ngeneralized linear bandits (GLBs). We propose an optimistic algorithm, GKB-UCB,\nand we explain why existing self-normalized concentration inequalities do not\nallow to provide tight regret guarantees. For this reason, we devise a novel\nself-normalized Bernstein-like dimension-free inequality resorting to\nFreedman's inequality and a stitching argument, which represents a contribution\nof independent interest. Based on it, we conduct a regret analysis of GKB-UCB,\nderiving a regret bound of order $\\widetilde{O}( \\gamma_T \\sqrt{T/\\kappa_*})$,\nbeing $T$ the learning horizon, ${\\gamma}_T$ the maximal information gain, and\n$\\kappa_*$ a term characterizing the magnitude the reward nonlinearity. Our\nresult matches, up to multiplicative constants and logarithmic terms, the\nstate-of-the-art bounds for both KBs and GLBs and provides a unified view of\nboth settings.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in natural\nlanguage generation but remain limited in knowle-\n  dge-intensive tasks due to outdated or incomplete internal knowledge.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external\nretrieval, with GraphRAG further enhancing performance through structured\nknowledge graphs and multi-hop reasoning. However, existing GraphRAG methods\nlargely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as\ntemporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To\novercome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic,\ntemporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over\ntime. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph\nGenerator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal\nQuery Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into\nmanageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that\nprogressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a\nSource Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that\nsynthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce\nTime-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual\nreports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge.\nExtensive experiments show that T-GRAG significantly outperforms prior RAG and\nGraphRAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response relevance under\ntemporal constraints, highlighting the necessity of modeling knowledge\nevolution for robust long-text question answering.

    "abstract": "KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource\nconstraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing\ntoken-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their\nirreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns\nduring decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both\nmarginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the\ncollective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal\ninformation over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two\ncompensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices\nbetween LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted\ncompensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention\nmatching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in\nperceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller\nmodel's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger\nmodel. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and\nLongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV.

    "abstract": "A central challenge in any study of the effects of beliefs on outcomes, such\nas decisions and behavior, is the risk of omitted variables bias. Omitted\nvariables, frequently unmeasured or even unknown, can induce correlations\nbetween beliefs and decisions that are not genuinely causal, in which case the\nomitted variables are referred to as confounders. To address the challenge of\ncausal inference, researchers frequently rely on information provision\nexperiments to randomly manipulate beliefs. The information supplied in these\nexperiments can serve as an instrumental variable (IV), enabling causal\ninference, so long as it influences decisions exclusively through its impact on\nbeliefs. However, providing varying information to participants to shape their\nbeliefs can raise both methodological and ethical concerns. Methodological\nconcerns arise from potential violations of the exclusion restriction\nassumption. Such violations may stem from information source effects, when\nattitudes toward the source affect the outcome decision directly, thereby\nintroducing a confounder. An ethical concern arises from manipulating the\nprovided information, as it may involve deceiving participants. This paper\nproposes and empirically demonstrates a new method for treating beliefs and\nestimating their effects, the Anchoring-Based Causal Design (ABCD), which\navoids deception and source influences. ABCD combines the cognitive mechanism\nknown as anchoring with instrumental variable (IV) estimation. Instead of\nproviding substantive information, the method employs a deliberately\nnon-informative procedure in which participants compare their self-assessment\nof a concept to a randomly assigned anchor value. We present the method and the\nresults of eight experiments demonstrating its application, strengths, and\nlimitations. We conclude by discussing the potential of this design for\nadvancing experimental social science.",

As users interact\nwith an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual\npreferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure\nalignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated\ninteraction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In\neach interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and\nexpresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user\nrequest and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can\ninfer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that\nsatisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary\nLLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from\nmulti-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant\nto a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall.

In this paper, we propose an efficient iterative method to solve\nthe linear stability equation of the kinetic equation. The solution process\ninvolves both outer and inner iterations. In the outer iteration, the shifted\ninverse power method is employed to compute selected eigenvalues and their\ncorresponding eigenfunctions of interest. For the inner iteration, which\ninvolves inverting the high-dimensional system for the velocity distribution\nfunction, we adopt our recently developed general synthetic iterative scheme to\nensure fast converging and asymptotic preserving properties. As a proof of\nconcept, our method demonstrates both high efficiency and accuracy in planar\nsound wave and Couette flow.

    "abstract": "Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various\ncomputer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is\nhindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as\nsegmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM\npre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation\nscenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To\novercome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based\nsegmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited\ndata and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.\nSpecifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a\ndomain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,\ninstance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the\nsegmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of\nthe backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the\nRein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and\nlogit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic\ntransfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment\nanything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated\nRein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,\ndaytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,\nnighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with\nefficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and\nadaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of\nparameters.

    "abstract": "Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both\nvisible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to\ncomplex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly\ndeformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single\nmodel to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse\namodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to\nadopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different\nshape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's\nunderlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and\ninsufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized\nexperts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific\nsparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to\nlearn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a\nlightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,\nShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures\nkey shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to\nthe most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert\nrouting. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting\noccluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well\ninterpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining\nhigh capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show\nthat ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in\noccluded region segmentation. The code will be released.",

While recent approaches such as\nthe Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they\noften perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape\nevolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios.

VELA first constructs an initial\nlevel set function from image features and the point input, which then\nprogressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a\nshape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This\nnetwork learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling\ngeometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling.

To further strengthen this alignment, recent\nworks have proposed Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple\naudio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby\npromoting fine-grained audio discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness\nin enabling difference-telling and detailed discrimination, ADC introduces a\nnotable semantic gap between the input audios-often rich in diverse sound\nevents-and the relatively brief, difference-focused output captions. This\ndeviation from AC-style descriptions leads to a mismatch with the pretraining\nobjective, resulting in catastrophic forgetting during finetuning. To mitigate\nthis issue, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably\nchallenging but gentler alternative that encourages the model to capture the\nshared semantics across audio clips rather than emphasizing their detailed\ndifferences. Experimental results demonstrate that ACC not only effectively\nenhances audio-text understanding on primary captioning benchmarks but also\nbetter preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music-related\ndownstream tasks, such as vocal sound classification (VSC), speech emotion\nrecognition (SER), musical instrument classification (MIC), and music genre\nclassification (MGC), compared to ADC.

In\nthis work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate\nhallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D\nsemantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across\nthis map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted\nby most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise\nconsistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention\nProcessing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages\nfactual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve\nfactual consistency.

    "abstract": "3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d\nobject, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction,\nembodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem\nvia learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture\nthe general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor\ngeneralization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image\ndiffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find\nthat such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate\nthat their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world\naffordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d\naffordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal\nrepresentations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance\nknowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We\nfurther introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to\nendow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show\nthat our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world\ngeneralization.",

To address these issues, we propose a\nDecoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion (DRKF) method for MER. DRKF\nconsists of two main modules: an Optimized Representation Learning (ORL) Module\nand a Knowledge Fusion (KF) Module. ORL employs a contrastive mutual\ninformation estimation method with progressive modality augmentation to\ndecouple task-relevant shared representations and modality-specific features\nwhile mitigating modality heterogeneity.

To handle potential errors from incorrect dominant modality\nselection under emotionally inconsistent conditions, we introduce an Emotion\nDiscrimination Submodule (ED), which enforces the fused representation to\nretain discriminative cues of emotional inconsistency. This ensures that even\nif the FE selects an inappropriate dominant modality, the Emotion\nClassification Submodule (EC) can still make accurate predictions by leveraging\npreserved inconsistency information.

Multiple Instance Learning\n(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level\nprediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while\noverlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction\nstage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap\nand suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown\npromise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds\nupon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.\nThis inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and\ninterdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and\ndrastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a\nCascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an\naverage of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust\nslide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling\nstrategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both\nmodel-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a\nLocal-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution\nWSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global\ncontextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR\nis optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity.

The research on Hamiltonian simulation methods for\nnonlinear governing equations remains relatively limited. In this study, we\npropose a Hamiltonian simulation method for nonlinear partial differential\nequations (PDEs). The proposed method is named Carleman linearization +\nSchr\\\"odingerization (CLS), which combines Carleman linearization (CL) and\nwarped phase transformation (WPT). CL is first applied to transform a nonlinear\nPDE into a linear differential equation. This linearized equation is then\nmapped to the Schr\\\"odinger equation via WPT. The original nonlinear PDE can be\nsolved efficiently by the Hamiltonian simulation of the resulting Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. By applying this method, we transform the original governing equation\ninto the Schr\\\"odinger equation. Solving the transformed Schr\\\"odinger equation\nthen enables the analysis of the original nonlinear equation. As a specific\napplication, we apply this method to the nonlinear reaction--diffusion equation\nto demonstrate that Hamiltonian simulations are applicable to nonlinear PDEs.",

Here, we report molecular dynamics investigations of thermal\ntransport properties in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). We investigated\nLinde Type A topological ZIFs (ZIF-lta) exhibiting exceptionally low thermal\nconductivity with unusual trend of temperature dependence deviating from many\ncrystalline materials, despite long-range crystalline order in them. We\ndemonstrate that heat is predominantly carried by phonons with mean free paths\ncomparable to their wavelengths, analogous to diffusons in amorphous solids\nowing to strong anharmonicity caused by complexity of unit cell consisting of a\nlarge number of metal centers. We further show that adsorbed hydrogen molecules\nincrease thermal conductivity of ZIFs, mainly contributed by additional\nvibrational modes, as a result of gas-gas or gas-framework interactions.

    "abstract": "Flow-matching-based policies have recently emerged as a promising approach\nfor learning-based robot manipulation, offering significant acceleration in\naction sampling compared to diffusion-based policies. However, conventional\nflow-matching methods struggle with multi-modality, often collapsing to\naveraged or ambiguous behaviors in complex manipulation tasks. To address this,\nwe propose the Variational Flow-Matching Policy (VFP), which introduces a\nvariational latent prior for mode-aware action generation and effectively\ncaptures both task-level and trajectory-level multi-modality. VFP further\nincorporates Kantorovich Optimal Transport (K-OT) for distribution-level\nalignment and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder for mode\nspecialization and efficient inference. We comprehensively evaluate VFP on 41\ntasks across four benchmark environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and\nsampling efficiency in both task and path multi-modality settings. Results show\nthat VFP achieves a $49\\%$ relative improvement in task success rate over\nstandard flow-based baselines, while maintaining fast inference and compact\nmodel size.

In this work, we present a microscopic quantum optical theory\ndescribing ATI under the influence of strong squeezed light. We observe that\nsqueezed light significantly enhances the coupling between light and matter,\nmaking their mutual backaction more important than under classical driving.\nThis backaction profoundly impacts the electronic ionization times, as well as\nthe non-classical properties of the joint electron-light state. This results in\npronounced entanglement features, both immediately after ionization, and at\nlater times. These entanglement features are reflected in the properties of the\nquantum optical state of the driving field revealing notable non-Gaussian\nfeatures that depend on both, the amount of squeezing, and the number of\nionization events occurring during the interaction.",

This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU),\ni.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points\nupon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full\nfine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the\noriginal training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and\nstorage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but\nsome rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain\nset, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this\npaper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet\neffective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU\nemploys gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of\nunlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences.\nThis adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while\nmaintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate\nthat IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.",

It also discusses the main simple examples of dualities:\nposition-momentum, wave-particle, electric-magnetic, and Kramers-Wannier\ndualities. Part II discusses advanced examples and their inter-relations:\nparticle-soliton dualities, electric-magnetic dualities in quantum field\ntheories, dualities in string theory, and gauge-gravity duality. This Part ends\nwith discussions of the hole argument, and how string theory counts the\nmicrostates of a black hole. Part III is an in-depth discussion of general\nphilosophical issues on which dualities bear: theoretical equivalence (two\ntheories 'saying the same thing, in different words'), scientific realism and\nthe under-determination of theories by data, theory succession and the M-theory\nprogramme, explanation, and scientific understanding.

The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on\nmodel decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated\nscripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the\npriority of the \"Garbage-In, Garbage-Out\" problem that caused poor data inputs\nor incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates\ntwo external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality\ndata at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time\nevaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model,\nidentify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External\nAgent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and\naccuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training\ncycles.

While recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their\nability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study,\nwe introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates\naccuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark\nincludes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of\ninterest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen\nimages. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-\nand closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with\nclosed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we\nuncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource\nregions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting\ndegraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics\ndemonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on\nrecognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and\nidentifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the\nspatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building\ngeolocation-aware AI systems.",

In particular, most\nof them rely on large amounts of clean data to weaken the backdoor mapping but\ngenerally struggle with residual trigger effects, resulting in persistently\nhigh attack success rates (ASR). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel\nBackdoor defense method based on Directional mapping module and adversarial\nKnowledge Distillation (BeDKD), which balances the trade-off between defense\neffectiveness and model performance using a small amount of clean and poisoned\ndata. We first introduce a directional mapping module to identify poisoned\ndata, which destroys clean mapping while keeping backdoor mapping on a small\nset of flipped clean data. Then, the adversarial knowledge distillation is\ndesigned to reinforce clean mapping and suppress backdoor mapping through a\ncycle iteration mechanism between trust and punish distillations using clean\nand identified poisoned data. We conduct experiments to mitigate mainstream\nattacks on three datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that BeDKD\nsurpasses the state-of-the-art defenses and reduces the ASR by 98% without\nsignificantly reducing the CACC.

    "abstract": "Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the\nmost accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging\nmultimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios,\ndue to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face\nthe issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the\nfeatures of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with\nresampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or\nunderfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we\npropose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis\n(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that\ncombines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal\ncomplementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually\nadapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class\ndistribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model\nto progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.\nExtensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that\nthe proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various\nmetrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,\nas a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other\nmodels, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis\naccuracy.

The key\nof our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a\nspatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality\ncomplementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality\nalone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone\nby self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different\nmodalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to\nfacilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed\npixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared\nparameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow\nbetween the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following\nmodality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused\ninformation flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates\nmodality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention.

Moreover, our proposed plug-and-play\nmulti-criteria guidance is compatible with different families of generative\nmodels, including denoised diffusion probabilistic models, variational\nautoencoders, and generative adversarial networks.

    "abstract": "Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate\nknowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,\nreplay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by\nrehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing\nhistorical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,\nexemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without\nstoring raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer\nfrom performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge\nrepresentations. To this end, we propose to fuse information from sequential\ndata into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling Privacy-Preserving\nReplay (Pr$^2$R). More specifically, by distilling the training characteristics\nof multiple real images into a single image, the fused samples undergo\npixel-level changes. This not only protects the privacy of the original data\nbut also makes the replay samples more representative for sequential tasks.\nDuring the style replay phase, we align the current domain to the previous one\nwhile simultaneously adapting the replay samples to match the style of the\ncurrent domain. This dual-alignment strategy effectively mitigates both\nclass-incremental challenges and forgetting caused by domain shifts. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly\nimproves replay effectiveness while preserving data privacy.

To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse\nweather condition-independent (Advent) framework (rather than a specific model\narchitecture) that can be implemented by various backbones and heads. This is\nachieved by leveraging the homogeneity over short durations, getting rid of\nclear reference and being generalizable to arbitrary weather condition.\nSpecifically, Advent includes three integral components: (I) Locally Sequential\nMechanism (LSM) leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to\nachieve the weather-condition-agnostic effect thanks to the homogeneity behind\narbitrary weather condition; (II) Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM) is proposed\nto shuffle segments processed by LSM from different positions of input sequence\nto prevent the overfitting to LSM-induced temporal patterns; (III) Unfolded\nRegularizers (URs) are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed\nregularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather\ngeneralization.

    "abstract": "The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models\n(LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of\nsolution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments.\nUnlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter\nreconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing\nagents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in\ncombinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a\nmultidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches,\nResources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how\nLLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter\nvalues/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\\'e domains (five\nlevels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over\n1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent\nadaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing\nreturns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable\ndesigns. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for\nspecific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework\nsupports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains\nlike customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving\nthe way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.",

In this paper, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm for\npersonalized federated learning system (DC-PFL) to address the problem of data\nheterogeneity. DC-PFL starts with all clients training a global model and\ngradually groups the clients into smaller clusters for model personalization\nbased on their data similarities. To address the challenge of estimating data\nheterogeneity without exposing raw data, we introduce a discrepancy metric\ncalled model discrepancy, which approximates data heterogeneity solely based on\nthe model weights received by the server. We demonstrate that model discrepancy\nis strongly and positively correlated with data heterogeneity and can serve as\na reliable indicator of data heterogeneity. To determine when and how to change\ngrouping structures, we propose an algorithm based on the rapid decrease period\nof the training loss curve. Moreover, we propose a layer-wise aggregation\nmechanism that aggregates the low-discrepancy layers at a lower frequency to\nreduce the amount of transmitted data and communication costs.

With the progress of\nvision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP),\ntheir promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong\ngeneralizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in\nCLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.\nDuring backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without\nconsidering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks\nthat disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while\ntext-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited\nplasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help\nbridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation\n(SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured\nnature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the\nbackbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier.\nSpecifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is\nproposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge\nvia textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive\nmanner as distillation signals.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recently proposed\nmodel featuring adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation\nof nonlinearities. This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new\nmodeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise\narchitecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages\nKAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven\nbenchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we\nsystematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison\nwith traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive\nflexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the\ninfluence of network structural prior on forecasting performance. Furthermore,\nwe identify critical design factors affecting forecasting accuracy and offer\npractical insights for effectively utilizing KAN in LTSF.

Thus, recursive inference is relevant for both\nstreaming data and settings where data too numerous to be analyzed together can\nbe partitioned into manageable pieces. In practice, posteriors are\ncharacterized by samples obtained using, e.g., acceptance/rejection sampling in\nwhich draws from the posterior of one iteration are used as proposals for the\nnext.

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of biological brain age from three dimensional (3D)\nT$_1$-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical imaging biomarker\nfor identifying accelerated aging associated with neurodegenerative diseases.\nEffective brain age prediction necessitates training 3D models to leverage\ncomprehensive insights from volumetric MRI scans, thereby fully capturing\nspatial anatomical context. However, optimizing deep 3D models remains\nchallenging due to problems such as vanishing gradients. Furthermore, brain\nstructural patterns differ significantly between sexes, which impacts aging\ntrajectories and vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases, thereby making\nsex classification crucial for enhancing the accuracy and generalizability of\npredictive models. To address these challenges, we propose a Deeply Supervised\nMultitask Autoencoder (DSMT-AE) framework for brain age estimation. DSMT-AE\nemploys deep supervision, which involves applying supervisory signals at\nintermediate layers during training, to stabilize model optimization, and\nmultitask learning to enhance feature representation. Specifically, our\nframework simultaneously optimizes brain age prediction alongside auxiliary\ntasks of sex classification and image reconstruction, thus effectively\ncapturing anatomical and demographic variability to improve prediction\naccuracy. We extensively evaluate DSMT-AE on the Open Brain Health Benchmark\n(OpenBHB) dataset, the largest multisite neuroimaging cohort combining ten\npublicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that DSMT-AE achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and robustness across age and sex subgroups.\nAdditionally, our ablation study confirms that each proposed component\nsubstantially contributes to the improved predictive accuracy and robustness of\nthe overall architecture.",

The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing\nEvaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative\ncategories according to category-level statistics, \\textit{e.g.}, category\nfrequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of\nLVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing\nobject hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that\noverlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative\nobject categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination\nsearching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate\nthe most misleading distractors (\\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or\nincorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which\nserves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination. To\nexplore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination\nsearching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to\napproximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with\nthe highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of\nhallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching\nconstructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false\ndescriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of\nat least 9\\% and up to 23\\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs,\nsignificantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities.

Further semantic\nfeature enhancement is achieved through the semantic cognitive enhancement\nmodule (SCEM), and finally, the cross fusion decoder (CFD) is used for change\ninformation fusion and image reconstruction.

To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient\nvideo RAG framework for video understanding.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous\ndecision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are\ntrained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that\nsystematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,\nwhere decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to\nprior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique\nchallenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear\nwhether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering\nconditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment\ntask across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,\nmulti-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500\ntrials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In\nindividual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate\nstrong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.\nHowever, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,\nN = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates\n(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal\nescalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and\npersonal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of\nescalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).\nThese findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social\nand organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant\nimplications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised\noperations where such conditions may emerge naturally.",

We propose the\nfirst Fluid Attention Block (FAB) with a local-global hierarchy, where\ncontinuous convolutions extract local features while self-attention captures\nglobal dependencies. This fusion suppresses the error accumulation and models\nlong-range physical phenomena. Furthermore, we pioneer the first Transformer\narchitecture specifically designed for continuous fluid simulation, seamlessly\nintegrated within a dual-pipeline architecture. Our method establishes a new\nparadigm for neural fluid simulation by unifying convolution-based local\nfeatures with attention-based global context modeling.

Three different configurations of the $X_0$, i.e., pure\nneutral components ($\\theta = 0$), isospin singlet ($\\theta = \\pi/4$) and pure\ncharged components ($\\theta = \\pi/2$), are investigated. Within a commonly\naccepted range of the model parameter $\\alpha$, the predicted decay widths of\n$X_0 \\to VV$ are on the order of a few hundred $\\mathrm{keV}$, while the decay\nwidths of $X_0 \\to PP$ can reach several $\\mathrm{MeV}$. The $X_0 \\to \\rho\\rho$\nand $\\pi\\pi$ have larger decay rates. The relative width ratios between the\nchannels are nearly model-independent.

    "abstract": "As agentic platforms scale, agents are evolving beyond static roles and fixed\ntoolchains, creating a growing need for flexible, decentralized coordination.\nToday's structured communication protocols (e.g., direct agent-to-agent\nmessaging) excel at reliability and task delegation, but they fall short in\nenabling emergent, swarm-like intelligence, where distributed agents\ncontinuously learn, adapt, and communicate to form collective cognition. This\npaper revisits gossip protocols, long valued in distributed systems for their\nfault tolerance and decentralization, and argues that they offer a missing\nlayer for context-rich, adaptive communication in agentic AI. Gossip enables\nscalable, low-overhead dissemination of shared knowledge, but also raises\nunresolved challenges around semantic filtering, staleness, trustworthiness,\nand consistency in high-stakes environments. Rather than proposing a new\nframework, this work charts a research agenda for integrating gossip as a\ncomplementary substrate alongside structured protocols. We identify critical\ngaps in current agent-to-agent architectures, highlight where gossip could\nreshape assumptions about coordination, and outline open questions around\nintent propagation, knowledge decay, and peer-to-peer trust. Gossip is not a\nsilver bullet, but overlooking it risks missing a key path toward resilient,\nreflexive, and self-organizing multi-agent systems.",

    "abstract": "The security of software builds has attracted increased attention in recent\nyears in response to incidents like solarwinds and xz. Now, several companies\nincluding Oracle and Google rebuild open source projects in a secure\nenvironment and publish the resulting binaries through dedicated repositories.\nThis practice enables direct comparison between these rebuilt binaries and the\noriginal ones produced by developers and published in repositories such as\nMaven Central. These binaries are often not bitwise identical; however, in most\ncases, the differences can be attributed to variations in the build\nenvironment, and the binaries can still be considered equivalent. Establishing\nsuch equivalence, however, is a labor-intensive and error-prone process.\n  While there are some tools that can be used for this purpose, they all fall\nshort of providing provenance, i.e. readable explanation of why two binaries\nare equivalent, or not. To address this issue, we present daleq, a tool that\ndisassembles Java byte code into a relational database, and can normalise this\ndatabase by applying datalog rules. Those databases can then be used to infer\nequivalence between two classes. Notably, equivalence statements are\naccompanied with datalog proofs recording the normalisation process. We\ndemonstrate the impact of daleq in an industrial context through a large-scale\nevaluation involving 2,714 pairs of jars, comprising 265,690 class pairs. In\nthis evaluation, daleq is compared to two existing bytecode transformation\ntools. Our findings reveal a significant reduction in the manual effort\nrequired to assess non-bitwise equivalent artifacts, which would otherwise\ndemand intensive human inspection. Furthermore, the results show that daleq\noutperforms existing tools by identifying more artifacts rebuilt from the same\ncode as equivalent, even when no behavioral differences are present.",
