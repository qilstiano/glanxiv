    "abstract": "This study examines conversational business analytics, an approach that\nutilizes AI to address the technical competency gaps that hinder end users from\neffectively using traditional self-service analytics. By facilitating natural\nlanguage interactions, conversational business analytics aims to empower end\nusers to independently retrieve data and generate insights. The analysis\nfocuses on Text-to-SQL as a representative technology for translating natural\nlanguage requests into SQL statements. Developing theoretical models grounded\nin expected utility theory, this study identifies the conditions under which\nconversational business analytics, through partial or full support, can\noutperform delegation to human experts. The results indicate that partial\nsupport, focusing solely on information generation by AI, is viable when the\naccuracy of AI-generated SQL queries leads to a profit that surpasses the\nperformance of a human expert. In contrast, full support includes not only\ninformation generation but also validation through explanations provided by the\nAI, and requires sufficiently high validation effectiveness to be reliable.\nHowever, user-based validation presents challenges, such as misjudgment and\nrejection of valid SQL queries, which may limit the effectiveness of\nconversational business analytics. These challenges underscore the need for\nrobust validation mechanisms, including improved user support, automated\nprocesses, and methods for assessing quality independent of the technical\ncompetency of end users.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new and intuitive metric for aleatoric uncertainty\nquantification (UQ), the prevalence of class collisions defined as the same\ninput being observed in different classes. We use the rate of class collisions\nto define the collision matrix, a novel and uniquely fine-grained measure of\nuncertainty. For a classification problem involving $K$ classes, the $K\\times\nK$ collision matrix $S$ measures the inherent difficulty in distinguishing\nbetween each pair of classes. We discuss several applications of the collision\nmatrix, establish its fundamental mathematical properties, as well as show its\nrelationship with existing UQ methods, including the Bayes error rate (BER). We\nalso address the new problem of estimating the collision matrix using one-hot\nlabeled data by proposing a series of innovative techniques to estimate $S$.\nFirst, we learn a pair-wise contrastive model which accepts two inputs and\ndetermines if they belong to the same class. We then show that this contrastive\nmodel (which is PAC learnable) can be used to estimate the Gramian matrix of\n$S$, defined as $G=S^TS$. Finally, we show that under reasonable assumptions,\n$G$ can be used to uniquely recover $S$, a new result on non-negative matrices\nwhich could be of independent interest. With a method to estimate $S$\nestablished, we demonstrate how this estimate of $S$, in conjunction with the\ncontrastive model, can be used to estimate the posterior class portability\ndistribution of any point. Experimental results are also presented to validate\nour methods of estimating the collision matrix and class posterior\ndistributions on several datasets.",

Most existing multimodal learning approaches heavily rely on\ntraining with a large amount of synchronized, complete multimodal data.\nHowever, such a setting is impractical in real-world IoT sensing applications\nwhere data is typically collected by distributed nodes with heterogeneous data\nmodalities, and is also rarely labeled. In this paper, we propose MMBind, a new\ndata binding approach for multimodal learning on distributed and heterogeneous\nIoT data.

After each pump laser pulse, an off-resonance probe beam\nmeasures the precession of noble-gas-spins-coupled alkali spins via optical\nrotation in the dark, thus eliminating effects from pump laser light shift and\npower fluctuations. Performing non-linear fitting on the sinusoidal transient\nsignal with a proper phase enables separate and simultaneous measurement of\nsignals along two orthogonal axes in the plane perpendicular to the pump beam.\nEffects from beam pointing fluctuations of the probe beam in the pump-probe\nplane is fundamentally eliminated, and signal response to pump beam pointing\nfluctuations is suppressed by compensation from noble-gas nuclear spins.",

Despite this, there is a\nsignificant need to optimise immunotherapeutic regimens to maximise clinical\nefficacy and patient quality of life whilst minimising monetary costs. To\naddress this, we employ a novel framework driven by delay integro-differential\nequations to model the interactions among cancer cells, immune cells, and\nimmune checkpoints. Several of these components are being modelled\ndeterministically for the first time in cancer, paving the way for a deeper\nunderstanding of the complex underlying immune dynamics.

At a critical fluid pressure level, the layer fails and\nbegins to accelerate. When we gradually reduce fluid pressure, a distinct\nbehavior emerges: slip-rate decreases linearly until the layer halts at a fluid\npressure level below that required to initiate failure. During this pressure\ncycle the system exhibits (1) velocity-strengthening friction and (2)\nfrictional hysteresis. These behaviors, well established in dry granular media,\nare shown to extend here to shear of dense fluid-saturated granular layers.\nAdditionally, we observe a delay between fluid pressure increase and failure,\nassociated with pre-failure dilative strain and \"dilational-hardening\". During\nthe delay period, small, arrested slip events dilate the layer in preparation\nfor full-scale failure. Our findings may explain (i) fault motion that\ncontinues even after fluid pressure returns to pre-injection levels, and (ii)\ndelayed failure in fluid-injection experiments, and (iii) pre-failure arrested\nslip events observed prior to earthquakes.",

In natural doubly diffusive convection, the\ngradients of temperature and salinity are aligned with each other and\northogonal to gravity. The resulting buoyancy-driven flows are known to lead to\nthe formation of a variety of patterns, including spatially localized states of\nconvection surrounded by quiescent fluid, which are known as convectons.\nLocalized pattern formation in natural doubly diffusive convection has been\nstudied under a specific balance where the effects of temperature and salinity\nchanges are opposite but of equal intensity on the fluid density. In this case,\na steady conduction state exists and convectons bifurcate from it. The\naforementioned buoyancy balance underpins our knowledge of this pattern\nformation but it is an ideal case that can hardly be met experimentally or in\nnature. This article addresses how localized pattern formation in natural\ndoubly diffusive convection is affected by departures from the balanced case.\nIn particular, the absence of a conduction state leads to the unfolding of the\nbifurcations to convectons. In thermally dominated regimes, the background flow\npromotes localized states with convection rolls attached to the end-walls,\nknown as anticonvectons, and the existence of these states is found to be\nrelated to the emergence of convectons. The results presented here shed light\non the convecton robustness against changes in the buoyancy ratio and extend\nthe scope of our understanding of localized pattern formation in fluid systems.",

    "abstract": "The performance of the nonlinearly stable flux reconstruction (NSFR) schemes\nfor resolving subsonic viscous turbulent free-shear flows is investigated. The\nschemes are extensively verified for the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of\nthe Taylor-Green Vortex (TGV) problem. Several under-resolved simulations of\nthe TGV problem are conducted to assess the performance of NSFR for large eddy\nsimulation that is implicitly filtered and fully implicit (ILES). Increasing\nthe flux reconstruction correction parameter ensures that NSFR is stable and\naccurate for ILES while allowing for larger explicit time-steps. The\nentropy-stable schemes implemented with sum-factorization for tensor and\nHadamard products are shown to be more cost-effective than classical DG with\nover-integration. The choice of the two-point (TP) numerical flux does not\nimpact the solution and the use of standard eddy-viscosity-based sub-grid scale\nmodels does not yield improvements for the problem considered. From the DNS\nresults, the pressure dilatation-based dissipation rate for the nonlinearly\nstable schemes is consistent with literature when computed from the kinetic\nenergy (KE) budget terms, while spurious oscillations are seen when the term is\ndirectly computed. The magnitude of these oscillations is significantly lower\nfor a collocated scheme and are effectively eliminated with the addition of Roe\nupwind dissipation to the TP numerical flux. Therefore, these oscillations are\nbelieved to be associated with the treatment of the face terms in nonlinearly\nstable schemes. It is shown that oversampling the velocity field is necessary\nfor obtaining accurate turbulent KE (TKE) spectra and eliminates an apparent\npile-up of TKE at the smallest resolved scales. Lastly, the TKE spectra for a\ndecaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence case are in good agreement with\nexperiment measurements and computational results in the literature.",

We find\nthat, by covering a fused silica slab by a graphene grating, the spectrum of\nthe normal CL force at small frequencies is increased by about 100% for a\ngrating filling fraction of 0.5, and even more when the slab is completely\ncovered. The typically employed additive approximation (the weighted average of\nthe force with and without the graphene coating) cannot provide any information\non the lateral CL force, and, as we show, cannot provide accurate estimation\nfor the normal CL force. When the nanoparticle is laterally shifted ($x_A$),\nthe normal CL force is modulated and remains attractive. On the contrary, the\nlateral CL force changes sign twice in each period, showing a series of\nalternating stable and unstable lateral equilibrium positions, occurring in the\ngraphene strips and of the grating slits regions, respectively. Finally, we\nshow that the lateral shift effect is sensitive to the geometric factor $d/D$\n($d$ is the separation distance, and $D$ is the grating period). We identify\ntwo clear regions: a region ($d/D<1.0$) where the lateral shift significantly\naffects the CL energy, and a region ($d/D \\geq 1.0$) where this effect is\nnegligible, with a crossover at $d\\approx D$.

Most results presented here appear to be\nnovel even in the special case of positive systems. First, we provide a simple\neigenvalue criterion for a Sylvester equation to admit a cone-preserving\nsolution. For a single system preserving a self-dual cone, this reduces to\nstability. Further, we provide a set of conditions equivalent to testing a\ngiven H-infinity norm bound, as in the bounded real lemma. These feature the\nstability of a coefficient matrix similar to the Hamiltonian, a solution to two\nconic inequalities, and a stabilizing cone-preserving solution to a\nnonsymmetric Riccati equation. Finally, we show that the H-infinity norm is\nattained at zero frequency.",

    "abstract": "The string indexing problem is a fundamental computational problem with\nnumerous applications, including information retrieval and bioinformatics. It\naims to efficiently solve the pattern matching problem: given a text T of\nlength n for preprocessing and a pattern P of length m as a query, the goal is\nto report all occurrences of P as substrings of T. Navarro and Thankachan [CPM\n2015, Theor. Comput. Sci. 2016] introduced a variant of this problem called the\ngap-bounded consecutive occurrence query, which reports pairs of consecutive\noccurrences of P in T such that their gaps (i.e., the distances between them)\nlie within a query-specified range [g_1, g_2]. Recently, Bille et al. [FSTTCS\n2020, Theor. Comput. Sci. 2022] proposed the top-k close consecutive occurrence\nquery, which reports the k closest consecutive occurrences of P in T, sorted in\nnon-decreasing order of distance. Both problems are optimally solved in query\ntime with O(n \\log n)-space data structures. In this paper, we generalize these\nproblems to the range query model, which focuses only on occurrences of P in a\nspecified substring T[a.. b] of T. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We\npropose an O(n \\log^2 n)-space data structure that answers the range top-k\nconsecutive occurrence query in O(m + \\log\\log n + k) time and can be built in\nO(n \\log^3 n) time; and (2) We propose an O(n \\log^{2+\\epsilon} n)-space data\nstructure that answers the range gap-bounded consecutive occurrence query in\nO(m + \\log\\log n + output) time and can be constructed in O(n \\log^{5/2}n)\ntime, where \\epsilon is a positive constant and output denotes the number of\noutputs. As by-products, we present algorithms for geometric problems involving\nweighted horizontal segments in a 2D plane, which are of independent interest.\nFurthermore, we observe that consecutive occurrences are related to closed\nsubstrings of a string.",

    "abstract": "Graph-level representations (and clustering/classification based on these\nrepresentations) are required in a variety of applications. Examples include\nidentifying malicious network traffic, prediction of protein properties, and\nmany others. Often, data has to stay in isolated local systems (i.e., cannot be\ncentrally shared for analysis) due to a variety of considerations like privacy\nconcerns, lack of trust between the parties, regulations, or simply because the\ndata is too large to be shared sufficiently quickly. This points to the need\nfor federated learning for graph-level representations, a topic that has not\nbeen explored much, especially in an unsupervised setting.\n  Addressing this problem, this paper presents a new framework we refer to as\nFederated Contrastive Learning of Graph-level Representations (FCLG). As the\nname suggests, our approach builds on contrastive learning. However, what is\nunique is that we apply contrastive learning at two levels. The first\napplication is for local unsupervised learning of graph representations. The\nsecond level is to address the challenge associated with data distribution\nvariation (i.e. the ``Non-IID issue\") when combining local models. Through\nextensive experiments on the downstream task of graph-level clustering, we\ndemonstrate FCLG outperforms baselines (which apply existing federated methods\non existing graph-level clustering methods) with significant margins.",

For example,\nzero-inflation is prevalent in microbiome data and single-cell RNA sequencing\ndata, which serve as our real data examples. Several models have been proposed\nto address zero-inflated datasets including the zero-inflated negative\nbinomial, hurdle negative binomial model, and the truncated latent Gaussian\ncopula model. This study aims to compare various models and determine which one\nperforms optimally under different conditions using both simulation studies and\nreal data analyses.

However, the resulting Lagrangian dual can have non-zero\nduality gap due to the inherent non-convexity of MIPs. In this paper, we\npropose two reformulations of such MIPs by adding redundant constraints, such\nthat the Lagrangian dual obtained by dualizing the coupling constraints and the\nredundant constraints have zero duality gap while still remaining decomposable.\nOne of these reformulations is similar, although not the same as the RLT\nhierarchy. In this case, we present multiplicative bounds on the quality of the\ndual bound at each level of the hierarchy for packing and covering MIPs. We\nshow our results are applicable to general sparse MIPs, where decomposability\nis revealed via the tree-decomposition of the intersection graph of the\nconstraint matrix. In preliminary experiments, we observe that the proposed\nLagrangian duals give better dual bounds than classical Lagrangian dual and\nGurobi in equal time, where Gurobi is not exploiting decomposability.",

To tackle this problem, we\npropose a new fragment-based molecule generation framework with retrieval\naugmentation, namely Fragment Retrieval-Augmented Generation (f-RAG). f-RAG is\nbased on a pre-trained molecular generative model that proposes additional\nfragments from input fragments to complete and generate a new molecule.

To extrapolate beyond the existing fragments, f-RAG updates the\nfragment vocabulary with generated fragments via an iterative refinement\nprocess which is further enhanced with post-hoc genetic fragment modification.\nf-RAG can achieve an improved exploration-exploitation trade-off by maintaining\na pool of fragments and expanding it with novel and high-quality fragments\nthrough a strong generative prior.",

The decision-maker only has ordinal access to\ncompare the elements, and the goal is to design an algorithm that selects every\nelement of the optimal basis with probability at least $\\alpha$ (i.e.,\n$\\alpha$-probability-competitive). While the existence of a constant\nprobability-competitive algorithm for MSP remains a major open question, simple\ngreedy policies are at the core of state-of-the-art algorithms for several\nmatroid classes.\n  We introduce a flexible and general algorithmic framework to analyze\ngreedy-like algorithms for MSP based on constructing a language associated with\nthe matroid.

The other relevant quantities are essentially dimensionless: fluid\nresponse to a bed perturbation, dune geometry (orientation, aspect ratio),\ntransport ratios under multi-directional wind regimes. We argue that laboratory\nexperiments dealing with sedimentary bedforms in water flows are good analogues\nto study the morphodynamics of aeolian dunes at reduced length and time scales,\nas $L_{\\rm sat}$ and $L_{\\rm sat}^2/Q$ are expected to be smaller for\nsubaqueous bedload. Besides, dune shape and dynamics are mainly governed by\nflow and boundary conditions, independent of the transport mode.

Under natural wind regimes in terrestrial\ndeserts, we show the potential of field experiments in which the control of\ninitial and boundary conditions allows for the quantification of all the\nrelevant mechanisms involved in dune growth.

Conversely, deep learning\nbased listwise methods, while aiming to optimise entire lists, require complex\ntuning and yield only marginal improvements over robust pairwise models. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce Travelling Salesman Problem Rank\n(TSPRank), a hybrid pairwise-listwise ranking method. TSPRank reframes the\nranking problem as a Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), a well-known\ncombinatorial optimisation challenge that has been extensively studied for its\nnumerous solution algorithms and applications. This approach enables the\nmodelling of pairwise relationships and leverages combinatorial optimisation to\ndetermine the listwise ranking. This approach can be directly integrated as an\nadditional component into embeddings generated by existing backbone models to\nenhance ranking performance. Our extensive experiments across three backbone\nmodels on diverse tasks, including stock ranking, information retrieval, and\nhistorical events ordering, demonstrate that TSPRank significantly outperforms\nboth pure pairwise and listwise methods. Our qualitative analysis reveals that\nTSPRank's main advantage over existing methods is its ability to harness global\ninformation better while ranking.

Furthermore,\nwe show that the dipolar interaction can be electrically switched and locally\nconfigured by simply tuning the gate voltage. Finally we show that with a\nsimple modification of the design, a full photon blockade is expected, setting\na new route towards scalable, reconfigurable, chip-integrated quantum photonic\ncircuits with strong two-photon nonlinearities.",

Our first network is a continuous time Markov chain $G=\\{G_t=(V,E_t),\nt\\ge 0\\}$ whose states are graphs with the common vertex set $V=\\{1,\\dots,\nn\\}$. The transitions are defined as follows. Given $t$, the vertex pairs\n$\\{i,j\\}\\subset V$ are assigned independent exponential waiting times $A_{ij}$.\nAt time $t+\\min_{ij} A_{ij}$ the pair $\\{i_0,j_0\\}$ with $A_{i_0j_0}=\\min_{ij}\nA_{ij}$ toggles its adjacency status. To mimic clustering patterns of sparse\nreal networks we set intensities $a_{ij}$ of exponential times $A_{ij}$ to be\nnegatively correlated with the degrees of the common neighbours of vertices $i$\nand $j$ in $G_t$. Another dynamic network is based on a latent Markov chain\n$H=\\{H_t=(V\\cup W, E_t), t\\ge 0\\}$ whose states are bipartite graphs with the\nbipartition $V\\cup W$, where $W=\\{1,\\dots,m\\}$ is an auxiliary set of\nattributes/affiliations.

We refine this algorithm, removing its need\nfor a normalization across actions and analyze the resulting method (referred\nto as SPMA). For tabular MDPs, we prove that SPMA with a constant step-size\nmatches the linear convergence of NPG and achieves a faster convergence than\nconstant step-size (accelerated) softmax policy gradient. To handle large\nstate-action spaces, we extend SPMA to use a log-linear policy\nparameterization. Unlike that for NPG, generalizing SPMA to the linear function\napproximation (FA) setting does not require compatible function approximation.\nUnlike MDPO, a practical generalization of NPG, SPMA with linear FA only\nrequires solving convex softmax classification problems. We prove that SPMA\nachieves linear convergence to the neighbourhood of the optimal value function.\nWe extend SPMA to handle non-linear FA and evaluate its empirical performance\non the MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Clouds and hazes are abundant in the thin and cold atmospheres of Triton and\nPluto, where they are thought to be produced by interactions between\natmospheric gases and ultraviolet photons from the Sun and those scattered by\nthe local interstellar medium. These interactions lead to a rich network of\nchemical reactions that produces higher order hydrocarbons and nitriles that\ncondense out to form ice clouds, and ultimately complex haze particles that\nrain down onto the surface that impact the atmospheric thermal structure, gas\nchemistry, and surface evolution. In this chapter, we will review the\nobservational evidence for clouds and hazes in the atmospheres of Triton and\nPluto and theoretical interpretations thereof, and the emerging set of\nexperiments aiming to produce Triton and Pluto clouds and hazes in the lab to\nlearn about them in detail.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the method of gaps, a technique for deriving closed-form\nexpressions in terms of information measures for the generalization error of\nmachine learning algorithms is introduced. The method relies on two central\nobservations: $(a)$~The generalization error is an average of the variation of\nthe expected empirical risk with respect to changes on the probability measure\n(used for expectation); and~$(b)$~these variations, also referred to as gaps,\nexhibit closed-form expressions in terms of information measures. The\nexpectation of the empirical risk can be either with respect to a measure on\nthe models (with a fixed dataset) or with respect to a measure on the datasets\n(with a fixed model), which results in two variants of the method of gaps. The\nfirst variant, which focuses on the gaps of the expected empirical risk with\nrespect to a measure on the models, appears to be the most general, as no\nassumptions are made on the distribution of the datasets. The second variant\ndevelops under the assumption that datasets are made of independent and\nidentically distributed data points. All existing exact expressions for the\ngeneralization error of machine learning algorithms can be obtained with the\nproposed method. Also, this method allows obtaining numerous new exact\nexpressions, which improves the understanding of the generalization error;\nestablish connections with other areas in statistics, e.g., hypothesis testing;\nand potentially, might guide algorithm designs.",

We start by studying the asymptotic\nquantiles of the excess risk of sequences of empirical risk minimizers.\nRemarkably, we show that when the set $\\mathcal{T}$ is not too large and when\nthere is a unique optimal feature map, these quantiles coincide, up to a factor\nof two, with those of the excess risk of the oracle procedure, which knows a\npriori this optimal feature map and deterministically outputs an empirical risk\nminimizer from the associated optimal linear class. We complement this\nasymptotic result with a non-asymptotic analysis that quantifies the decaying\neffect of the global complexity of the set $\\mathcal{T}$ on the excess risk of\nERM, and relates it to the size of the sublevel sets of the suboptimality of\nthe feature maps.

However, internal defects such\nas porosity and cracks can compromise mechanical properties and overall\nperformance. This study focuses on in-situ monitoring and characterization of\nmelt pools associated with porosity, aiming to improve defect detection and\nquality control in DED-printed parts. Traditional machine learning approaches\nfor defect identification rely on extensive labeled datasets, often scarce and\nexpensive to generate in real-world manufacturing. To address this, our\nframework employs self-supervised learning on unlabeled melt pool data using a\nVision Transformer-based Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to produce highly\nrepresentative embeddings. These fine-tuned embeddings are leveraged via\ntransfer learning to train classifiers on a limited labeled dataset, enabling\nthe effective identification of melt pool anomalies. We evaluate two\nclassifiers: (1) a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier utilizing the fine-tuned\nMAE Encoder's parameters and (2) the fine-tuned MAE Encoder combined with an\nMLP classifier head. Our framework achieves overall accuracy ranging from\n95.44% to 99.17% and an average F1 score exceeding 80%, with the ViT Classifier\nslightly outperforming the MAE Encoder Classifier.

    "abstract": "The estimation of uncertainties in cosmological parameters is an important\nchallenge in Large-Scale-Structure (LSS) analyses. For standard analyses such\nas Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Full Shape, two approaches are\nusually considered. First: analytical estimates of the covariance matrix use\nGaussian approximations and (nonlinear) clustering measurements to estimate the\nmatrix, which allows a relatively fast and computationally cheap way to\ngenerate matrices that adapt to an arbitrary clustering measurement. On the\nother hand, sample covariances are an empirical estimate of the matrix based on\nen ensemble of clustering measurements from fast and approximate simulations.\nWhile more computationally expensive due to the large amount of simulations and\nvolume required, these allow us to take into account systematics that are\nimpossible to model analytically. In this work we compare these two approaches\nin order to enable DESI's key analyses. We find that the configuration space\nanalytical estimate performs satisfactorily in BAO analyses and its flexibility\nin terms of input clustering makes it the fiducial choice for DESI's 2024 BAO\nanalysis. On the contrary, the analytical computation of the covariance matrix\nin Fourier space does not reproduce the expected measurements in terms of Full\nShape analyses, which motivates the use of a corrected mock covariance for\nDESI's Full Shape analysis.",

We first\nconsider the $\\mu(a,k)$-$\\Sigma(a,k)$ modified gravity (MG) parametrization (as\nwell as $\\eta(a,k)$) in flat $\\Lambda$CDM and $w_0 w_a$CDM backgrounds. Using a\nfunctional form for time-only evolution gives $\\mu_0= 0.11^{+0.44}_{-0.54}$\nfrom DESI(FS+BAO)+BBN and a wide prior on $n_{s}$. Using\nDESI(FS+BAO)+CMB+DESY3+DESY5-SN, we obtain $\\mu_0 = 0.05\\pm 0.22$ and $\\Sigma_0\n= 0.008\\pm 0.045$ in the $\\Lambda$CDM background. In $w_0 w_a$CDM, we obtain\n$\\mu_0 =-0.24^{+0.32}_{-0.28}$ and $\\Sigma_0 = 0.006\\pm 0.043$, consistent with\nGR, and we still find a preference of the data for dynamical dark energy with\n$w_0>-1$ and $w_a<0$. We then use binned forms in the two backgrounds starting\nwith two bins in redshift and then combining them with two bins in scale for a\ntotal of 4 and 8 MG parameters, respectively. All MG parameters are found\nconsistent with GR. We also find that the tension reported for $\\Sigma_0$ with\nGR when using Planck PR3 goes away when we use the recent LoLLiPoP+HiLLiPoP\nlikelihoods. As noted previously, this seems to indicate that the tension is\nrelated to the CMB lensing anomaly in PR3 which is also resolved when using\nthese likelihoods. We then constrain the class of Horndeski theory in the\neffective field theory of dark energy. We consider both EFT-basis and\n$\\alpha$-basis. Assuming a power law parametrization for the function $\\Omega$,\nwhich controls non-minimal coupling, we obtain $\\Omega_0 =\n0.012^{+0.001}_{-0.012}$ and $s_0 = 0.996^{+0.54}_{-0.20}$ from\nDESI(FS+BAO)+DESY5SN+CMB in a $\\Lambda$CDM background.

As a\nresult, the observed clustering amplitude is suppressed in a scale-dependent\nmanner, which, if not addressed, can severely impact the inference of\ncosmological parameters.

We present the mitigation\ntechniques, organised in two classes: measurement stage and model stage. We\nthen use high fidelity mocks as a reference to quantify both the accuracy of\nthe FFA emulator and the effectiveness of the different measurement-stage\nmitigation techniques. This complements the studies conducted in a parallel\npaper for the model-stage techniques, namely the $\\theta$-cut approach.

However,\nthey are afflicted by strong spurious correlations between target density and\nobserving conditions known as imaging systematics. We present the imaging\nsystematics mitigation applied to the DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) large-scale\nstructure catalogs used in the DESI 2024 cosmological analyses. We also explore\nextensions of the fiducial treatment. This includes a combined approach,\nthrough forward image simulations in conjunction with neural network-based\nregression, to obtain an angular selection function that mitigates the imaging\nsystematics observed in the DESI DR1 ELGs target density. We further derive a\nline-of-sight selection function from the forward model that removes the strong\nredshift dependence between imaging systematics and low redshift ELGs.\nCombining both angular and redshift-dependent systematics, we construct a 3D\nselection function and assess the impact of all selection functions on\nclustering statistics. We quantify differences between these extended\ntreatments and the fiducial treatment in terms of the measured 2-point\nstatistics. We find that the results are generally consistent with the fiducial\ntreatment and conclude that the differences are far less than the imaging\nsystematics uncertainty included in DESI 2024 full-shape measurements. We\nextend our investigation to the ELGs at $0.6<z<0.8$, i.e., beyond the redshift\nrange ($0.8<z<1.6$) adopted for the DESI clustering catalog, and demonstrate\nthat determining the full 3D selection function is necessary in this redshift\nrange. Our tests showed that all changes are consistent with statistical noise\nfor BAO analyses indicating they are robust to even severe imaging systematics.\nSpecific tests for the full-shape analysis will be presented in a companion\npaper.",

    "abstract": "We analyse the robustness of the DESI 2024 cosmological inference from the\nfull shape of the galaxy power spectrum to uncertainties in the Halo Occupation\nDistribution (HOD) model of the galaxy-halo connection and the choice of priors\non nuisance parameters. We assess variations in the recovered cosmological\nparameters across a range of mocks populated with different HOD models and find\nthat shifts are often greater than 20% of the expected statistical\nuncertainties from the DESI data. We encapsulate the effect of such shifts in\nterms of a systematic covariance term, $\\mathsf{C}_{\\rm HOD}$, and an\nadditional diagonal contribution quantifying the impact of our choice of\nnuisance parameter priors on the ability of the effective field theory (EFT)\nmodel to correctly recover the cosmological parameters of the simulations.\nThese two covariance contributions are designed to be added to the usual\ncovariance term, $\\mathsf{C}_{\\rm stat}$, describing the statistical\nuncertainty in the power spectrum measurement, in order to fairly represent\nthese sources of systematic uncertainty. This novel approach should be more\ngeneral and robust to the choice of model or additional external datasets used\nin cosmological fits than the alternative approach of adding systematic\nuncertainties to the recovered marginalised parameter posteriors. We compare\nthe approaches within the context of a fixed $\\Lambda$CDM model and demonstrate\nthat our method gives conservative estimates of the systematic uncertainty that\nnevertheless have little impact on the final posteriors obtained from DESI\ndata.",

    "abstract": "We present cosmological results from the measurement of clustering of galaxy,\nquasar and Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest tracers from the first year of observations\nwith the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI Data Release 1). We adopt\nthe full-shape (FS) modeling of the power spectrum, including the effects of\nredshift-space distortions, in an analysis which has been validated in a series\nof supporting papers. In the flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, DESI\n(FS+BAO), combined with a baryon density prior from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis\nand a weak prior on the scalar spectral index, determines matter density to\n$\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}=0.2962\\pm 0.0095$, and the amplitude of mass fluctuations to\n$\\sigma_8=0.842\\pm 0.034$. The addition of the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) data tightens these constraints to $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}=0.3056\\pm 0.0049$\nand $\\sigma_8=0.8121\\pm 0.0053$, while further addition of the the joint\nclustering and lensing analysis from the Dark Energy Survey Year-3 (DESY3) data\nleads to a 0.4% determination of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = (68.40\\pm\n0.27)\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$. In models with a time-varying dark energy\nequation of state, combinations of DESI (FS+BAO) with CMB and type Ia\nsupernovae continue to show the preference, previously found in the DESI DR1\nBAO analysis, for $w_0>-1$ and $w_a<0$ with similar levels of significance.\nDESI data, in combination with the CMB, impose the upper limits on the sum of\nthe neutrino masses of $\\sum m_\\nu < 0.071\\,{\\rm eV}$ at 95% confidence. DESI\ndata alone measure the modified-gravity parameter that controls the clustering\nof massive particles, $\\mu_0=0.11^{+0.45}_{-0.54}$, while the combination of\nDESI with the CMB and the clustering and lensing analysis from DESY3 constrains\nboth modified-gravity parameters, giving $\\mu_0 = 0.04\\pm 0.22$ and $\\Sigma_0 =\n0.044\\pm 0.047$, in agreement with general relativity.

    "abstract": "We present the measurements and cosmological implications of the galaxy\ntwo-point clustering using over 4.7 million unique galaxy and quasar redshifts\nin the range $0.1<z<2.1$ divided into six redshift bins over a $\\sim 7,500$\nsquare degree footprint, from the first year of observations with the Dark\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI Data Release 1). By fitting the full\npower spectrum, we extend previous DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)\nmeasurements to include redshift-space distortions and signals from the\nmatter-radiation equality scale. For the first time, this Full-Shape analysis\nis blinded at the catalogue-level to avoid confirmation bias and the systematic\nerrors are accounted for at the two-point clustering level, which automatically\npropagates them into any cosmological parameter. When analysing the data in\nterms of compressed model-agnostic variables, we obtain a combined precision of\n4.7\\% on the amplitude of the redshift space distortion signal reaching similar\nprecision with just one year of DESI data than with 20 years of observation\nfrom previous generation surveys. We analyse the data to directly constrain the\ncosmological parameters within the $\\Lambda$CDM model using perturbation theory\nand combine this information with the reconstructed DESI DR1 galaxy BAO. Using\na Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Gaussian prior on the baryon density parameter, and\na Gaussian prior on the spectral index, we constrain the matter density is\n$\\Omega_m=0.296\\pm 0.010 $ and the Hubble constant $H_0=(68.63 \\pm 0.79)[{\\rm\nkm\\, s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}]$. Additionally, we measure the amplitude of clustering\n$\\sigma_8=0.841 \\pm 0.034$. The DESI DR1 results are in agreement with the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model based on general relativity with parameters consistent with\nthose from Planck. The cosmological interpretation of these results in\ncombination with external datasets are presented in a companion paper.",

While this approach\nproduces high-quality results with intricate shading details, it often has\ndifficulty producing relit images with consistent skin tones, particularly when\nthe lighting condition is extracted from images of individuals with dark skin.\nAdditionally, this technique is biased towards producing albedo images with\nlighter skin tones. Our main observation is that this problem is rooted in the\nbiased spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients, used during training.

We then propose a simple, but effective, strategy to mitigate the\nproblem. Specifically, we normalize the SH coefficients by their DC term to\neliminate the inherent magnitude bias, while statistically align the\ncoefficients in the other bands to alleviate the directional bias.

    "abstract": "We present the R-band lightcurves of the Flora family asteroid (12499) 1998\nFR47, obtained in 2022 at two different astronomical sites: Bulgarian National\nAstronomical Observatory Rozhen (MPC Code 071) and Astronomical Station\nVidojevica (MPC Code C89). The quadramodal lightcurves reveal a rotation period\nof 6.172+/-0.003 h and an amplitude of about 0.44 mag. Using the lightcurve\ninversion method, with the combination of our dense lightcurves and the sparse\ndata from Gaia DR3, we found the sidereal period, an indication of a retrograde\nrotation of (12499) and its low-convex resolution shape. Nonetheless, the\nunusual shape of the quadramodal lightcurve and its additional analysis reveals\ntwo possible periods, 3.0834+/-0.0085 h and 4.1245+/-0.0151 h, making the\nsuspect that the asteroid might be a non-synchronised wide binary system.\nSpectral analysis of the asteroid using data from the GAIA DR3 shows that it is\neither an M- or an L-type object and maybe a piece of the first planetesimals\nto form in the Solar System protoplanetary disk. On the other hand, (12499)'s\ndynamical properties indicate a significantly shorter lifetime. The asteroid\nlies exactly on the chaotic border of the 7:4 mean motion resonance with Mars\n(7M:4), alternating between being in and out of it for almost 190 Myrs. During\n200 Myrs of integration, (12499) visited other resonances in the Flora family,\nbut it never became a Near Earth Object (NEO). Additional integration of\nfictive objects from the 7M:4 resonance showed a possibility of transportation\nto the NEO region already at about 20 Myrs.",

This novel framework exhibits complete\nsymmetry, endowing it with perfect mathematical properties. While we have\nexamined some of the system's mathematical characteristics, a detailed\ndiscussion of the network training methodology has not yet been presented.\nDrawing on the principles of the traditional backpropagation algorithm, this\nstudy proposes an alternative training approach that utilizes differential\nequation signal propagation instead of chain rule derivation. This approach not\nonly preserves the effectiveness of training but also offers enhanced\nbiological interpretability. The foundation of this methodology lies in the\nsystem's reversibility, which stems from its inherent symmetry,a key aspect of\nour research. However, this method alone is insufficient for effective neural\nnetwork training. To address this, we further introduce a distributed\nProportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control approach, emphasizing its\nimplementation within a closed system. By incorporating this method, we\nachieved both faster training speeds and improved accuracy. This approach not\nonly offers novel insights into neural network training but also extends the\nscope of research into control methodologies.

Standard PIMD simulations\nare numerically converged by systematically increasing the number of classical\n'beads' or replicas used to represent each particle in the quantum system.\nCurrently available scientific software for PIMD simulations leverage the\nmassively parallel (with respect to number of beads) nature of the classical\nPIMD Hamiltonian. For particularly high-dimensional systems, contraction\nschemes designed to reduce the overall number of beads per particle required to\nachieve numerical convergence are also frequently employed.

In this paper, we make use of\ntwo-dimensional image decomposition to model the host galaxies of SNe Ia. We\nmodel elliptical galaxies as well as disk/spiral galaxies with or without\ncentral bulges and bars. This allows for the categorisation of SN Ia based on\ntheir morphological host environment, as well as the extraction of intrinsic\ngalaxy properties corrected for both cosmological and atmospheric effects. We\nfind that although this image decomposition technique leads to a significant\nbias towards elliptical galaxies in our final sample of galaxies, the overall\nresults are robust. By successfully modelling 728 host galaxies, we find that\nthe photometric properties of SNe Ia found in disks and in elliptical galaxies,\ncorrelate fundamentally differently with their host environment. We identified\nstrong linear relations between light-curve stretch and our model-derived\ngalaxy colour for both the elliptical (16.8$\\sigma$) and disk (5.1$\\sigma$)\nsubpopulations of SNe Ia. Lower stretch SNe Ia are found in redder\nenvironments, which we identify as an age/metallicity effect. Within the\nsubpopulation of SNe Ia found in disk containing galaxies, we find a\nsignificant linear trend (6.1$\\sigma$) between light-curve stretch and\nmodel-derived local $r$-band surface brightness, which we link to the\nage/metallicity gradients found in disk galaxies. SN Ia colour shows little\ncorrelation with host environment as seen in the literature.

Its charging energy yields\nnon-trivial correlations among the dots, although, unlike a standard tetron, it\nis not directly determined by the fermionic parity of the Majorana modes. The\npoor man's tetron displays parameter regions with a two-fold degenerate ground\nstate with odd fermionic parity, that gives rise to an effective Anderson\nimpurity model when coupled to external leads. We show that this system can\napproach a regime featuring the topological Kondo effect under a suitable\ntuning of experimental parameters.

With a rising number of power outages caused by these\nevents, accurate prediction of power line outages is essential for safe and\nreliable operation of power grids. The Bayesian network is a probabilistic\nmodel that is very effective for predicting line outages under weather-related\nuncertainties. However, most existing studies in this area offer general risk\nassessments, but fall short of providing specific outage probabilities. In this\nwork, we introduce a novel approach for predicting transmission line outage\nprobabilities using a Bayesian network combined with Peter-Clark (PC)\nstructural learning. Our approach not only enables precise outage probability\ncalculations, but also demonstrates better scalability and robust performance,\neven with limited data.

A Bohm-type anomalous\ncollisionality scaling ($\\nu_{an}=\\alpha_{an}\\omega_{ce}$) is implemented to\nsimulations of the 150 W-class REGULUS-150-Xe thruster, evaluating both\nlow-power (30 W) and high-power (150 W) operating conditions. The impact on\nazimuthal electron current formation is assessed, as well as its subsequent\neffect on thrust generation, momentum and power balance, and overall propulsive\nefficiency. A critical value of the Bohm coefficient was found to exist, where\nthe MN expansion transitions from a well-collimated to an under-collimated\nstate and electron transport shifts from being dominated by magnetic advection\nto being dominated by cross-field diffusion. This critical transition was found\nto occur within a narrow interval between $\\alpha_{an}$=1/128 and 1/64. Beyond\nthis threshold, it is found that the enhanced cross-field transport of\nelectrons inhibits the formation of the typical MN potential barrier, reducing\nthe radial confinement. The downstream potential drop is reduced by up to 15\\%.\nDiamagnetic electron current is diminished in the absence of steep pressure\ngradients and the $E\\times B$ current becomes purely paramagnetic. The MN\nefficiency is cut from circa 0.5 to 0.2 due to loss of electron thermal energy\nconversion and increased plume divergence. At the Bohm limit of\n$\\alpha_{an}=1/16$, agreement to experimental thrust profiles of $<20\\%$ is\nachieved in contrast to 48\\% overestimation at high-power in the classical\ncase.",

However, a notable\nresearch gap remains in effectively exploring both L2D and L2C under diverse\nexpert knowledge to improve decision-making, particularly when constrained by\nthe cooperation cost required to achieve a target probability for AI-only\nselection (i.e., coverage). In this paper, we address this research gap by\nproposing the Coverage-constrained Learning to Defer and Complement with\nSpecific Experts (CL2DC) method. CL2DC makes final decisions through either AI\nprediction alone or by deferring to or complementing a specific expert,\ndepending on the input data. Furthermore, we propose a coverage-constrained\noptimisation to control the cooperation cost, ensuring it approximates a target\nprobability for AI-only selection. This approach enables an effective\nassessment of system performance within a specified budget. Also, CL2DC is\ndesigned to address scenarios where training sets contain multiple noisy-label\nannotations without any clean-label references.

In this\nwork, we propose a novel binned bispectrum of the form\ntemperature-temperature-density to extract the late-time kSZ effect from\ncleaned CMB maps. Unlike 'kSZ tomography' methods, this estimator can use any\ntracer of the large-scale structure density field projected along the\nline-of-sight and does not require individual redshifts. With our method, we\nforecast signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of $\\sim$100-200 for the upcoming Simons\nObservatory (SO) and CMB-S4 correlated with a galaxy sample from WISE that is\nrestricted to the linear regime. We also extend galaxy modes into the\nnon-linear regime and explore this harmonic space to show that the SNR peaks\nfor squeezed triangles that have a short (linear) density mode and long\ntemperature modes in harmonic space. The existing kSZ$^{2}-$density\nprojected-fields estimator compresses the rich information contained in this\nbispectrum across various scales and triangle shapes. Moreover, we find that\nthe lensing correction to this estimator's signal is relatively small for\nhigh-SNR squeezed triangle configurations. We study the dependence of this kSZ\nsignal on $\\Lambda$CDM parameters for SO and CMB-S4 and forecast initial\nconstraints on the sum of neutrino masses while restricting to the linear\ngalaxy bias regime.

Sgr A*-NIR is highly\nvariable, and studying the spectral index $\\alpha$ (with $F_\\nu \\propto\n\\nu^{\\alpha}$) is essential to determine the underlying emission mechanism. For\nexample, variations in $\\alpha$ with flux may arise from shifts in the\nsynchrotron cutoff frequency, changes in the distribution of electrons, or\nmultiple concurrent emission mechanisms. We investigate potential variations of\n$\\alpha_{H-K^\\prime}$ with flux by analyzing 7 epochs (2005 to 2022) of Keck\nObservatory imaging observations from the Galactic Center Orbits Initiative\n(GCOI). We remove the flux contribution of known sources confused with Sgr\nA*-NIR, which can significantly impact color at faint flux levels. We\ninterpolate between the interleaved $H$ and $K^\\prime$ observations using\nMulti-Output Gaussian Processes. We introduce a flexible empirical model to\nquantify $\\alpha$ variations and probe different scenarios. The observations\nare best fit by an $\\alpha_{H-K^\\prime} = - 0.50 \\pm 0.08 _{\\rm stat} \\pm\n0.17_{\\rm sys}$ that is constant from $\\sim 1$ mJy to $\\sim 40$ mJy (dereddened\n2 $\\mu$m flux). We find no evidence for a flux-dependence of Sgr A*'s intrinsic\nspectral index. In particular, we rule out a model explaining NIR variability\npurely by shifts in the synchrotron cutoff frequency. We also constrain the\npresence of redder, quiescent emission from the black hole, concluding that the\ndereddened 2 $\\mu$m flux contribution must be $\\leq 0.3$ mJy at 95% confidence\nlevel.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between radio-jets and quasar host galaxies plays a paramount\nrole in quasar/galaxy co-evolution. However, very little has been known so far\nabout this interaction at very high-z. Here, we present new Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations in Band 7 and Band 3 of six\nradio-loud quasars' host galaxies at $z > 5$. We recover [CII] 158 $\\mu$m line\nand underlying dust continuum emission at $>2\\sigma$ for five sources, while we\nobtain upper limits for the CO(6-5) emission line and continuum for the\nremaining source. At the spatial resolution of our observations\n($\\sim$1.0\"-1.4\"), we do not recover perturbed/extended morphologies or\nkinematics, signatures of potential mergers. These galaxies already host large\nquantities of gas, with [CII]-based star formation rates of $30-400 M_{\\odot}\n$yr$^{-1}$. Building their radio/sub-mm spectral energy distributions (SEDs),\nwe find that in at least four cases the 1mm continuum intensity arises from a\ncombination of synchrotron and dust emission, with an initial estimation of\nsynchrotron contribution at 300 GHz of $\\gtrsim$10%. We compare the properties\nof the sources inspected here with a large collection of radio-quiet sources\nfrom the literature, as well as a sample of radio-loud quasars from previous\nstudies, at comparable redshift. We recover a potential mild decrease in\n$L_{\\rm [CII]}$ for the radio-loud sources, which might be due to a suppression\nof the cool gas emission due to the radio-jets. We do not find any\n[CII]-emitting companion galaxy candidate around the five radio-loud quasars\nobserved in Band 7: given the depth of our dataset, this result is still\nconsistent with that observed around radio-quiet quasars. Further\nhigher-spatial resolution observations, over a larger frequency range, of\nhigh-z radio-loud quasars hosts will allow for a better understanding of the\nphysics of such sources.",

However, training quantum models remains a\nchallenging task, largely because of the difficulty in establishing an\neffective inductive bias when solving high-dimensional problems. In this work,\nwe propose a training framework that prioritizes informative data points over\nthe entire training set. This approach draws inspiration from classical\ntechniques such as curriculum learning and hard example mining to introduce an\nadditional inductive bias through the training data itself. By selectively\nfocusing on informative samples, we aim to steer the optimization process\ntoward more favorable regions of the parameter space. This data-centric\napproach complements existing strategies such as warm-start initialization\nmethods, providing an additional pathway to address performance challenges in\nquantum machine learning. We provide theoretical insights into the benefits of\nprioritizing informative data for quantum models, and we validate our\nmethodology with numerical experiments on selected recognition tasks of quantum\nphases of matter. Our findings indicate that this strategy could be a valuable\napproach for improving the performance of quantum machine learning models.",

Furthermore, we find a distinct EM signature for\neccentric binaries: they spend more time in a low emission state (at apocenter)\nand less in a high state (at pericenter). Additionally, we find that the\neccentric binary quasiperiodic gravitational-wave (GW) bursts are coincident\nwith the bursts in Poynting luminosity and synchrotron emission.

However, it has been challenging to\nidentify protoclusters beyond $z=3$ only by photometry due to large redshift\nuncertainties, hindering statistical study. To tackle the issue, we develop a\nnew deep-learning-based protocluster detection model, PCFNet, which considers a\nprotocluster as a point cloud. To detect protoclusters at $z\\sim4$ using only\noptical broad-band photometry, we train and evaluate PCFNet with mock\n$g$-dropout galaxies based on the N-body simulation with the semi-analytic\nmodel. We use the sky distribution, $i$-band magnitude, $(g-i)$ color, and the\nredshift probability density function surrounding a target galaxy on the sky.\nPCFNet achieves to detect five times more protocluster member candidates while\nmaintaining high purity (recall $=7.5\\pm0.2$%, precision $=44\\pm1$%) than\nconventional methods. Moreover, PCFNet is able to detect more progenitors\n($M_\\mathrm{halo}^{z=0}=10^{14-14.5}\\,M_\\odot$) that are less massive than\nsupermassive clusters like the Coma cluster. We apply PCFNet to the\nobservational photometric dataset of the HSC-SSP Deep/UltraDeep layer\n($\\sim17\\mathrm{\\,deg^2}$) and detect $121$ protocluster candidates at\n$z\\sim4$. We find the rest-UV luminosities of our protocluster member\ncandidates are brighter than those of field galaxies, which is consistent with\nprevious studies. Additionally, the quenching of satellite galaxies depends on\nboth the core galaxy's halo mass at $z\\sim4$ and accumulated mass until $z=0$\nin the simulation.

While these facilities produce images with\na Strehl ratio larger than 90% in H-band in median observing conditions and\nhigh-flux regime, the correction leaves AO residuals which impede the study of\nfainter or less massive exoplanets. Cascade AO systems with a fast second stage\nbased on a Pyramid wavefront sensor have recently emerged as an appealing\nsolution to reduce the atmospheric wavefront errors. Since these aberrations\nare expected to be small, they can also be accurately measured by a Zernike\nwavefront sensor (ZWFS), a well-known concept for its high sensitivity and\nmoderate linear capture range. We propose an alternative second stage that\nrelies on the ZWFS to correct for the AO residuals. We implemented the cascade\nAO with a ZWFS-based control loop on the ESO's GHOST testbed to validate the\nscheme in monochromatic light. In median wind speed and seeing, our\nsecond-stage AO with a ZWFS and a basic integrator reduce the atmospheric\nresiduals by a factor of 6 and increase the wavefront error stability with a\ngain of 2 from open to closed loop. In the presence of non common path\naberrations, we also reach a contrast gain by a factor of 2 in the images with\na Lyot coronagraph at short separations from the source, proving the ability of\nour scheme to work in cascade with an XAO loop. In addition, it may prove\nuseful for imaging fainter or lighter close-in companions. In more challenging\nconditions, contrast improvements are also achieved by adjusting the control\nloop features. Our study validates the ZWFS-based second-stage AO loop as an\neffective solution to address small residuals left from a single-stage XAO\nsystem for the coronagraphic observations of circumstellar environments.",

Current models, however, are still\nunable to explain several aspects of their formation. In this paper, we focus\non three outstanding problems: i) Mach number estimates derived from radio data\ndo not agree with those derived from X-ray data, ii) cooling length arguments\nimply a magnetic field that is at least an order of magnitude larger than the\nsurrounding intracluster medium (ICM), and iii) spectral index variations do\nnot agree with standard cooling models. To solve these problems, we first\nidentify typical shock conditions in cosmological simulations, using the\nresults to inform significantly higher resolution shock-tube simulations. We\napply the cosmic ray electron spectra code CREST and the emission code CRAYON+\nto these, thereby generating mock observables ab-initio. We identify that upon\nrunning into an accretion shock, merger shocks generate a shock-compressed\nsheet, which, in turn, runs into upstream density fluctuations in pressure\nequilibrium. This mechanism directly gives rise to solutions to the three\nproblems: it creates a distribution of Mach numbers at the shock-front, which\nflattens cosmic ray electron spectra, thereby biasing radio-derived Mach number\nestimates to higher values. We show that this effect is particularly strong in\nweaker shocks. Secondly, the density sheet becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable at\nthe contact discontinuity, causing turbulence and additional compression\ndownstream. This amplifies the magnetic field from ICM-like conditions up to\nmicrogauss levels. We show that synchrotron-based measurements are strongly\nbiased by the tail of the distribution here too. Finally, the same instability\nalso breaks the common assumption that matter is advected at the post-shock\nvelocity downstream, thus invalidating laminar-flow based cooling models.",

Because\nthey are diagnosed within quantum field theory (QFT) on a smooth background,\nthese singularities may provide a better-controlled version of the spacetime\nsingularity problem, and merit further study.\n  Here, I highlight a mildness puzzle of Cauchy horizon singularities: the\n$\\langle T_{\\mu\\nu} \\rangle$ singularity is significantly milder than expected\nfrom symmetry and dimensional analysis. I address the puzzle in a simple\nspacetime $W_P$, which arises universally near all black hole Cauchy horizons:\nthe past of a codimension-two spacelike plane in flat spacetime. Specifically,\nI propose an extremely broad QFT construction in which, roughly speaking,\nCauchy horizon singularities originate from operator insertions in the causal\ncomplement of the spacetime. The construction reproduces well-known outer\nhorizon singularities (e.g., in the Boulware state), and remarkably, when\napplied to $W_P$, gives rise to a universal mild singularity structure for\nrobust singularities, ones whose leading singular behavior is\nstate-independent.

    "abstract": "Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A\nmajority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that\nphysically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world\nstate. In contrast, humans can $\\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world\nthrough a mental exploration and $\\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined\nobservations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed\ndecisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all\ntimes. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\\textit{Generative\nWorld Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows\nan agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and\nacquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will\nthen help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To\ntrain $\\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\\textit{Genex}$ can generate\nhigh-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a\nlarge virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated\nobservations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent)\nto make better plans.",

Unlike the ad hoc approach of instant\ncircularization that is often employed, explicit modeling of eMT reveals a\nlarge fraction of binaries can remain eccentric post-MT. Even binaries which\nnaturally circularize during eMT have different properties (donor mass and\norbital size) compared to predictions from instant circularization, with some\nshowing fundamentally different evolutionary outcomes (e.g., stable versus\nunstable MT). We demonstrate that a binary's initial mass ratio and\neccentricity are predictive of whether it will remain eccentric or circularize\nafter eMT.

Sampling the episodes under a simulated environment is a promising way\nfor large-scale collection while existing simulators fail to high-fidelity\nmodeling on texture and physics. To address these limitations, we introduce the\nRoboGSim, a real2sim2real robotic simulator, powered by 3D Gaussian Splatting\nand the physics engine. RoboGSim mainly includes four parts: Gaussian\nReconstructor, Digital Twins Builder, Scene Composer, and Interactive Engine.\nIt can synthesize the simulated data with novel views, objects, trajectories,\nand scenes. RoboGSim also provides an online, reproducible, and safe evaluation\nfor different manipulation policies. The real2sim and sim2real transfer\nexperiments show a high consistency in the texture and physics. We compared the\ntest results of RoboGSim data and real robot data on both RoboGSim and real\nrobot platforms. The experimental results show that the RoboGSim data model can\nachieve zero-shot performance on the real robot, with results comparable to\nreal robot data. Additionally, in experiments with novel perspectives and novel\nscenes, the RoboGSim data model performed even better on the real robot than\nthe real robot data model. This not only helps reduce the sim2real gap but also\naddresses the limitations of real robot data collection, such as its\nsingle-source and high cost.

We apply the PMC with its new algorithm for\nvolatility forecasting, which we compare to the highly popular GARCH(1,1) and\nfeedforward neural models across numerous pairs. This is particularly relevant\ngiven the regime changes that we can observe in volatility.

In self-supervised learning,\ndifferent input categories map to distinct manifolds in the embedded neural\nstate space. Accurate classification is achieved by separating these manifolds\nduring learning, akin to a packing problem. We investigate the dynamics of\n``neural manifold packing'' by employing a minimal model in which SGD is\napplied to spherical particles in physical space. In this model, SGD minimizes\nthe system's energy (classification loss) by stochastically reducing overlaps\nbetween particles (manifolds). We observe that this process undergoes an\nabsorbing phase transition, prompting us to use the framework of biased random\norganization (BRO), a nonequilibrium absorbing state model, to describe SGD\nbehavior. We show that BRO dynamics can be approximated by those of particles\nwith linear repulsive interactions under multiplicative anisotropic noise.\nThus, for a linear repulsive potential and small kick sizes (learning rates),\nwe find that BRO and SGD become equivalent, converging to the same critical\npacking fraction $\\phi_c \\approx 0.64$, despite the fundamentally different\norigins of their noise. This equivalence is further supported by the\nobservation that, like BRO, near the critical point, SGD exhibits behavior\nconsistent with the Manna universality class.

We use thermochemical equilibrium condensation calculations\nand show that the condensation sequence of TiC, graphite, and SiC depends on\nmetallicity in addition to C/O ratio and total pressure. Calculations were\nperformed for a characteristic carbon star ratio of C/O = 1.2 from 1E-10 to\n1E-4 bars total pressure and for uniform metallicity variations ranging from\n0.01 to 100 times solar elemental abundances. TiC always condenses before SiC,\nand the carbide condensation temperatures increase with increasing metallicity\nand total pressure. Graphite, however, can condense in a cooling circumstellar\nenvelope before TiC, between TiC and SiC, or after SiC, depending on the\ncarbon-bearing gas chemistry, which is dependent on metallicity and total\npressure. Analytical expressions for the graphite, TiC, and SiC condensation\ntemperatures as functions of metallicity and total pressure are presented. The\ninferred sequence from laboratory presolar grain studies, TiC-graphite-SiC, is\nfavored under equilibrium conditions at solar and subsolar metallicities\nbetween ~1E-5 to 1E-8 bar total pressure within circumstellar envelopes of\ncarbon stars with nominal C/O = 1.2.

    "abstract": "The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey is mapping the\nlarge-scale distribution of millions of Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) over vast\ncosmic volumes to measure the growth history of the Universe. However, compared\nto Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), very little is known about the connection of\nELGs with the underlying matter field. In this paper, we employ a novel\ntheoretical model, SHAMe-SF, to infer the connection between ELGs and their\nhost dark matter subhaloes. SHAMe-SF is a version of subhalo abundance matching\nthat incorporates prescriptions for multiple processes, including star\nformation, tidal stripping, environmental correlations, and quenching. We\nanalyse the public measurements of the projected and redshift-space ELGs\ncorrelation functions at $z=1.0$ and $z=1.3$ from DESI One Percent data\nrelease, which we fit over a broad range of scales $r \\in [0.1, 30]/h^{-1}$Mpc\nto within the statistical uncertainties of the data. We also validate the\ninference pipeline using two mock DESI ELG catalogues built from hydrodynamical\n(TNG300) and semi-analytical galaxy formation models (\\texttt{L-Galaxies}).\nSHAMe-SF is able to reproduce the clustering of DESI-ELGs and the mock DESI\nsamples within statistical uncertainties. We infer that DESI ELGs typically\nreside in haloes of $\\sim 10^{11.8}h^{-1}$M$_{\\odot}$ when they are central,\nand $\\sim 10^{12.5}h^{-1}$M$_{\\odot}$ when they are a satellite, which occurs\nin $\\sim$30 \\% of the cases. In addition, compared to the distribution of dark\nmatter within halos, satellite ELGs preferentially reside both in the outskirts\nand inside haloes, and have a net infall velocity towards the centre. Finally,\nour results show evidence of assembly bias and conformity.",

This process is\nusually accomplished by extracting features from an image, using classifier\nalgorithms, and correctly interpreting the results. Recognizing forgeries of\nfacial imagery correctly can encounter many different challenges. For example,\nfactors such as changing lighting conditions, viewing faces from different\nangles can affect recognition performance, and background complexity and\nperspective changes in facial images can make accurate recognition difficult.\nDespite these difficulties, significant progress has been made in the field of\nforgery detection. Deep learning algorithms, especially Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), have significantly improved forgery detection performance.\n  This study focuses on image processing-based forgery detection using\nFake-Vs-Real-Faces (Hard) [10] and 140k Real and Fake Faces [61] data sets.\nBoth data sets consist of two classes containing real and fake facial images.\nIn our study, two lightweight deep learning models are proposed to conduct\nforgery detection using these images. Additionally, 8 different pretrained CNN\narchitectures were tested on both data sets and the results were compared with\nnewly developed lightweight CNN models. It's shown that the proposed\nlightweight deep learning models have minimum number of layers.

Since contemporary machine learning algorithms have generally\nproven difficult to analyze directly, conformal prediction's main appeal is its\nability to provide formal, finite-sample guarantees when paired with such\nmethods.\n  The goal of this book is to teach the reader about the fundamental technical\narguments that arise when researching conformal prediction and related\nquestions in distribution-free inference.

    "abstract": "Modeling disease progression is crucial for improving the quality and\nefficacy of clinical diagnosis and prognosis, but it is often hindered by a\nlack of longitudinal medical image monitoring for individual patients. To\naddress this challenge, we propose the first Medical Video Generation (MVG)\nframework that enables controlled manipulation of disease-related image and\nvideo features, allowing precise, realistic, and personalized simulations of\ndisease progression. Our approach begins by leveraging large language models\n(LLMs) to recaption prompt for disease trajectory. Next, a controllable\nmulti-round diffusion model simulates the disease progression state for each\npatient, creating realistic intermediate disease state sequence. Finally, a\ndiffusion-based video transition generation model interpolates disease\nprogression between these states. We validate our framework across three\nmedical imaging domains: chest X-ray, fundus photography, and skin image. Our\nresults demonstrate that MVG significantly outperforms baseline models in\ngenerating coherent and clinically plausible disease trajectories. Two user\nstudies by veteran physicians, provide further validation and insights into the\nclinical utility of the generated sequences. MVG has the potential to assist\nhealthcare providers in modeling disease trajectories, interpolating missing\nmedical image data, and enhancing medical education through realistic, dynamic\nvisualizations of disease progression.",

Digital\nbeamforming techniques are applied to align the astronomical signals,\neffectively minimizing interference from communication sources. Calibration is\nachieved using multiple distributed satellites transmitting known signals,\nenabling precise channel estimation and phase correction via GPS localization.\nWe analyze two calibration methods, Phase Alignment Calibration (PAC) and\nEigenvalue-Based Calibration (EVC), and demonstrate that EVC outperforms PAC in\nenvironments with significant variation in node performance. Compared to the\nGreen Bank Telescope (GBT), the IoT-based telescope enhances antenna gain by\nthree orders of magnitude and increases survey speed by eight orders of\nmagnitude, owing to the vast number of nodes and expansive field of view (FoV).\nThese findings demonstrate the feasibility and significant advantages of the\nIoT-enabled telescope, paving the way for cost-effective, high-speed, and\nwidely accessible astronomical observations.",

Here we\ninvestigate the use of ultrafast lasers for fabricating nanostructures in\nsapphire by exploring the relationship between irradiation parameters,\nmorphology change, and selective etching. In this approach an ultrafast laser\npulse is focused on the sapphire substrate to change the crystalline morphology\nto amorphous or polycrystalline, which is characterized by examining different\nvibrational modes using Raman spectroscopy. The irradiated regions are then\nremoved using a subsequent wet etch in hydrofluoric acid. Laser confocal\nmeasurements conducted before and after the etching process quantify the degree\nof selective etching. The results indicate that a threshold laser pulse\nintensity is required for selective etching to occur. This process can be used\nto fabricate hierarchical sapphire nanostructures over large areas with\nenhanced hydrophobicity, which exhibits an apparent contact angle of 140\ndegrees and a high roll-off angle that are characteristic of the rose petal\neffect. Additionally, the fabricated structures have high broadband diffuse\ntransmittance of up to 81.8% with low loss, which can find applications in\noptical diffusers. Our findings provide new insights into the interplay between\nthe light-matter interactions, where Raman shifts associated with different\nvibrational modes can be used as a predictive measure of selective etching.\nThese results advance the development of sapphire nanostructure fabrication,\nwhich can find applications in infrared optics, protective windows, and\nconsumer electronics.",

When the initial state of the polymer is\nnot collapsed or the final folded native state, the dynamics of dimerization\ncan follow a course sensitive to both the initial conditions and the\nconformational dynamics. Here we study the dimerization process by using\ncomputer simulations and analytical theory where both the two monomeric polymer\nchains are in the elongated state and are initially placed at a separation\ndistance, d0. Subsequent dynamics lead to the concurrent processes of collapse,\ndimerization and/or escape. We employ Langevin dynamics simulations with a\ncoarse-grained model of the polymer to capture certain aspects of the\ndimerization process. At separations d0 much shorter than the length of the\nmonomeric polymer, the dimerization could happen fast and irreversibly, from\nthe partly extended polymer state itself. At an initial separation larger than\na critical distance, dc, the polymer collapse precedes dimerization and a\nsignificant number of single polymers do not dimerize within the time scale of\nsimulations. To quantify these competition, we introduce several time-dependent\norder parameters, namely, (i) the time-dependent radius of gyration of\nindividual polymers describing the conformational state of the polymer, (ii) a\ncentre-to-centre of mass distance parameter RMM, and (iii) a time dependent\noverlap function Q(t) between the two monomeric polymers, mimicking contact\norder parameter popular in protein folding.

Our\nresearch delineates a crucial correlation between dynamics of the shadow images\nand the parameters $a$,~ $q$ and the $\\theta_{obs}$, which aptly reflect the\ninfluence of the model parameters on the optical features of shadow images.\nInitially, elevated behavior of both $a$ and $q$ transforms the geometry of the\nshadow images from perfect circles to an oval shape and converges them towards\nthe centre of the screen. By imposing the backward ray-tracing method, we\ndemonstrate the optical appearance of shadow images of the considering BH\nspacetime in the celestial light source. The results demonstrate that the\nEinstein ring shows a transition from an axisymmetric closed circle to an\narc-like shape on the screen as well as producing the deformation on the shadow\nshape with the modifications of spacetime parameters at the fixed observational\nposition. Next, we observe that the attributes of accretion disks along with\nthe relevant parameters on the shadow images are illuminated by both prograde\nand retrograde accreting flow. Our study reveals the process by which the\naccretion disk transitions from a disk-like structure to a hat-like shape with\nthe aid of observational angles. Moreover, with an increase of $q$, the\nobserved flux of both direct and lensed images of the accretion disk gradually\nmoves towards the lower zone of the screen. Furthermore, we present the\nintensity distribution of the redshift factors on the screen. Our analysis\nsuggests that the observer can see both redshift and blueshift factors on the\nscreen at higher observational angles, while augmenting the values of both $a$\nand $q$, enhancing the effect of redshift on the screen.",

We show that such a specific form in the transition probabilities\nallows one to build compositional abstractions of stochastic systems that, for\neach state, are only required to store the marginal probability bounds of the\noriginal system. This leads to improved memory complexity for our approach\ncompared to commonly employed abstraction-based approaches. Furthermore, we\nshow that an optimal control strategy for a odIMDPs can be computed by solving\na set of linear problems.

To test our theoretical framework, we perform an extensive\nempirical comparison of our methods against Interval Markov Decision Process-\nand Markov Decision Process-based approaches on various benchmarks including 7D\nsystems.

    "abstract": "Machine learning for scientific discovery is increasingly becoming popular\nbecause of its ability to extract and recognize the nonlinear characteristics\nfrom the data. The black-box nature of deep learning methods poses difficulties\nin interpreting the identified model. There is a dire need to interpret the\nmachine learning models to develop a physical understanding of dynamic systems.\nAn interpretable form of neural network called Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN)\nor Multiplicative KAN (MultKAN) offers critical features that help recognize\nthe nonlinearities in the governing ordinary/partial differential equations\n(ODE/PDE) of various dynamic systems and find their equation structures. In\nthis study, an equation discovery framework is proposed that includes i)\nsequentially regularized derivatives for denoising (SRDD) algorithm to denoise\nthe measure data to obtain accurate derivatives, ii) KAN to identify the\nequation structure and suggest relevant nonlinear functions that are used to\ncreate a small overcomplete library of functions, and iii) physics-informed\nspline fitting (PISF) algorithm to filter the excess functions from the library\nand converge to the correct equation. The framework was tested on the forced\nDuffing oscillator, Van der Pol oscillator (stiff ODE), Burger's equation, and\nBouc-Wen model (coupled ODE). The proposed method converged to the true\nequation for the first three systems. It provided an approximate model for the\nBouc-Wen model that could acceptably capture the hysteresis response. Using KAN\nmaintains low complexity, which helps the user interpret the results throughout\nthe process and avoid the black-box-type nature of machine learning methods.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal medical image fusion is a crucial task that combines complementary\ninformation from different imaging modalities into a unified representation,\nthereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. While deep\nlearning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and\nTransformers, have significantly advanced fusion performance, some of the\nexisting CNN-based methods fall short in capturing fine-grained multiscale and\nedge features, leading to suboptimal feature integration. Transformer-based\nmodels, on the other hand, are computationally intensive in both the training\nand fusion stages, making them impractical for real-time clinical use.\nMoreover, the clinical application of fused images remains unexplored. In this\npaper, we propose a novel CNN-based architecture that addresses these\nlimitations by introducing a Dilated Residual Attention Network Module for\neffective multiscale feature extraction, coupled with a gradient operator to\nenhance edge detail learning. To ensure fast and efficient fusion, we present a\nparameter-free fusion strategy based on the weighted nuclear norm of softmax,\nwhich requires no additional computations during training or inference.\nExtensive experiments, including a downstream brain tumor classification task,\ndemonstrate that our approach outperforms various baseline methods in terms of\nvisual quality, texture preservation, and fusion speed, making it a possible\npractical solution for real-world clinical applications.

Motivated by the linear contextual bandit\nframework, we assume that for each agent, an arm-mean may be represented by a\nlinear function of a known feature vector and an unknown (agent-specific)\nparameter.

To explore this, we propose a\npotential game framework where each client's payoff is determined by their\nindividual efforts and the rewards provided by the server. The rewards are\ninfluenced by the collective efforts of all clients and can be modulated\nthrough a reward factor.

    "abstract": "Tuning the density of resident electrons or holes in semiconductors provides\ncrucial insight into the composition of excitonic complexes that are observed\nas absorption or photoluminescence resonances in optical studies. Moreover, we\ncan change the way these resonances shift and broaden in energy by controlling\nthe quantum numbers of the resident carriers with magnetic fields and doping\nlevels, and by selecting the quantum numbers of the photoexcited or recombining\nelectron-hole (e-h) pair through optical polarization. We discuss the roles of\ndistinguishability and optimality of excitonic complexes, showing them to be\nkey ingredients that determine the energy shifts and broadening of optical\nresonances in charge-tunable semiconductors. A distinguishable e-h pair means\nthat the electron and hole undergoing photoexcitation or recombination have\nquantum numbers that are not shared by any of the resident carriers. An optimal\nexcitonic complex refers to a complex whose particles come with all available\nquantum numbers of the resident carriers. All optical resonances may be\nclassified as either distinct or indistinct depending on the distinguishability\nof the e-h pair, and the underlying excitonic complex can be classified as\neither optimal or suboptimal. The universality of these classifications,\ninherited from the fundamental Pauli exclusion principle, allows us to\nunderstand how optical resonances shift in energy and whether they should\nbroaden as doping is increased. This understanding is supported by conclusive\nevidence that the decay of optical resonances cannot be simply attributed to\nenhanced screening when resident carriers are added to a semiconductor.\nFinally, applying the classification scheme in either monolayer or moire\nheterobilayer systems, we relate the energy shift and amplitude of the neutral\nexciton resonance to the compressibility of the resident carrier gas.",

The bound $Cr\\log(n/r)$ is tight for $r\\geq \\log n$,\nwhile the bound $Cr^2 \\log \\log n$ is tight for $r<(\\log n)^{1-\\Omega(1)}$.\nThese results resolve a problem of R\\\"odl and Wysocka from 1997 for almost all\nvalues of $r$.\n  Among other tools, we develop a novel random process that efficiently finds a\nvery nearly regular subgraph in any almost-regular graph. A key step in our\nproof uses this novel random process to show that every $K$-almost-regular\ngraph with average degree $d$ contains an $r$-regular subgraph for some\n$r=\\Omega_K(d)$, which is of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing architectures based on neutral atoms offer large scales and\nhigh-fidelity operations. They can be heterogeneous, with different zones for\nstorage, entangling operations, and readout. Zoned architectures improve\ncomputation fidelity by shielding idling qubits in storage from side-effect\nnoise, unlike monolithic architectures where all operations occur in a single\nzone. However, supporting these flexible architectures with efficient\ncompilation remains challenging. In this paper, we propose ZAC, a scalable\ncompiler for zoned architectures. ZAC minimizes data movement overhead between\nzones with qubit reuse, i.e., keeping them in the entanglement zone if an\nimmediate entangling operation is pending. Other innovations include novel data\nplacement and instruction scheduling strategies in ZAC, a flexible\nspecification of zoned architectures, and an intermediate representation for\nzoned architectures, ZAIR. Our evaluation shows that zoned architectures\nequipped with ZAC achieve a 22x improvement in fidelity compared to monolithic\narchitectures. Moreover, ZAC is shown to have a 10% fidelity gap on average\ncompared to the ideal solution. This significant performance enhancement\nenables more efficient and reliable quantum circuit execution, enabling\nadvancements in quantum algorithms and applications.

    "abstract": "In the last few decades the development of ultrafast lasers has\nrevolutionized our ability to gain insight into light-matter interactions. The\nappearance of few-cycle light sources available from the visible to the\nmid-infrared spectral range and the development of attosecond extreme\nultraviolet and x-ray technologies provide for the first time the possibility\nto directly observe and control ultrafast electron dynamics in matter on their\nnatural time scale. However, few-fs sources have hardly been available in the\ndeep ultraviolet (DUV; 4-6 eV, 300-200 nm) and are unavailable in the vacuum\nultraviolet (VUV; 6-12 eV, 200-100 nm) spectral range, corresponding to the\nphoton energies required for valence excitation of atoms and molecules. Here,\nwe generate VUV pulses with $\\mu$J energy tunable between 160 and 190 nm via\nresonant dispersive wave emission during soliton self-compression in a\ncapillary. We fully characterize the pulses in situ using frequency-resolved\noptical gating based on two-photon photoionization in noble gases. The\nmeasurements reveal that in most of the cases the pulses are shorter than 3 fs.\nThese findings unlock the potential to investigate ultrafast electron dynamics\nwith a time-resolution that has been hitherto inaccessible when using VUV\npulses.",

An effective FOG\ndetection system must be accurate, real-time, and deployable in free-living\nenvironments to enable timely interventions. However, existing detection\nmethods face challenges due to (1) intra- and inter-patient variability, (2)\nsubject-specific training, (3) using multiple sensors in FOG dominant locations\n(e.g., ankles) leading to high failure points, (4) centralized, non-adaptive\nlearning frameworks that sacrifice patient privacy and prevent collaborative\nmodel refinement across populations and disease progression, and (5) most\nsystems are tested in controlled settings, limiting their real-world\napplicability for continuous in-home monitoring. Addressing these gaps, we\npresent FOGSense, a real-world deployable FOG detection system designed for\nuncontrolled, free-living conditions using only a single sensor. FOGSense uses\nGramian Angular Field (GAF) transformations and privacy-preserving federated\ndeep learning to capture temporal and spatial gait patterns missed by\ntraditional methods with a low false positive rate. We evaluated our system\nusing a public Parkinson's dataset collected in a free-living environment.\nFOGSense improves accuracy by 10.4% over a single-axis accelerometer, reduces\nfailure points compared to multi-sensor systems, and demonstrates robustness to\nmissing values. The federated architecture allows personalized model adaptation\nand efficient smartphone synchronization during off-peak hours, making it\neffective for long-term monitoring as symptoms evolve. Overall, FOGSense\nachieved a 22.2% improvement in F1-score and a 74.53% reduction in false\npositive rate compared to state-of-the-art methods, along with enhanced\nsensitivity for FOG episode detection.",

While reinforcement learning (RL)\nhas shown promising results in simulated environments, discrepancies between\nsimulations and real-world conditions have limited its practical deployment.\nThis study introduces an innovative control framework that integrates\ntrajectory optimization with drift maneuvers, aiming to improve the algorithm's\nadaptability for real-vehicle implementation. We leveraged Bezier-based\npre-trajectory optimization to enhance rewards and optimize the controller\nthrough Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) in a simulated\nenvironment. For real-world deployment, we implement a hybrid RL-MPC fusion\nmechanism, , where TD3-derived maneuvers serve as primary inputs for a Model\nPredictive Controller (MPC). This integration enables precise real-time\ntracking of the optimal trajectory, with MPC providing corrective inputs to\nbridge the gap between simulation and reality. The efficacy of this method is\nvalidated through real-vehicle tests on consumer-grade electric vehicles,\nfocusing on drift U-turns and drift right-angle turns. The control outcomes of\nthese real-vehicle tests are thoroughly documented in the paper, supported by\nsupplementary video evidence (https://youtu.be/5wp67FcpfL8).

Similar to how humans\ninteract in social contexts, we can use many types of feedback to communicate\nour preferences, intentions, and knowledge to an RL agent. However,\napplications of human feedback in RL are often limited in scope and disregard\nhuman factors. In this work, we bridge the gap between machine learning and\nhuman-computer interaction efforts by developing a shared understanding of\nhuman feedback in interactive learning scenarios. We first introduce a taxonomy\nof feedback types for reward-based learning from human feedback based on nine\nkey dimensions. Our taxonomy allows for unifying human-centered,\ninterface-centered, and model-centered aspects. In addition, we identify seven\nquality metrics of human feedback influencing both the human ability to express\nfeedback and the agent's ability to learn from the feedback. Based on the\nfeedback taxonomy and quality criteria, we derive requirements and design\nchoices for systems learning from human feedback. We relate these requirements\nand design choices to existing work in interactive machine learning. In the\nprocess, we identify gaps in existing work and future research opportunities.\nWe call for interdisciplinary collaboration to harness the full potential of\nreinforcement learning with data-driven co-adaptive modeling and varied\ninteraction mechanics.",

    "abstract": "Spin polarization and spin transport are common phenomena in many quantum\nsystems. Relativistic spin hydrodynamics provides an effective low-energy\nframework to describe these processes in quantum many-body systems. The\nfundamental symmetry underlying relativistic spin hydrodynamics is angular\nmomentum conservation, which naturally leads to inter-conversion between spin\nand orbital angular momenta. This inter-conversion is a key feature of\nrelativistic spin hydrodynamics, closely related to entropy production and\nintroducing ambiguity in the construction of constitutive relations. In this\narticle, we present a pedagogical introduction to relativistic spin\nhydrodynamics. We demonstrate how to derive the constitutive relations by\napplying local thermodynamic laws and explore several distinctive aspects of\nspin hydrodynamics. These include the pseudo-gauge ambiguity, the behavior of\nthe system in the presence of strong vorticity, and the challenges of modeling\nthe freeze-out of spin in heavy-ion collisions. We also outline some future\nprospects for spin hydrodynamics.",

For example,\nnonparametric regression methods allow for the estimation of regression\nfunctions in a data-driven manner with minimal assumptions; however, these\nmethods typically fail to achieve $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency in their convergence\nrates, and many, including those in machine learning, lack guarantees that\ntheir estimators asymptotically follow a normal distribution. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a debiasing technique for nonparametric estimators by\nadding a bias-correction term to the original estimators, extending the\nconventional one-step estimator used in semiparametric analysis. Specifically,\nfor each data point, we estimate the conditional expected residual of the\noriginal nonparametric estimator, which can, for instance, be computed using\nkernel (Nadaraya-Watson) regression, and incorporate it as a bias-reduction\nterm. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed estimator\nachieves $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality under a mild\nconvergence rate condition for both the original nonparametric estimator and\nthe conditional expected residual estimator. Notably, this approach remains\nmodel-free as long as the original estimator and the conditional expected\nresidual estimator satisfy the convergence rate condition.

The primary goal of these approaches is to address the challenge of\noptimization methods becoming trapped in suboptimal local minima by replacing\nthe standard gradient with a non-local gradient derived from averaging function\nvalues using anisotropic Gaussian smoothing. Unlike isotropic Gaussian\nsmoothing (IGS), AGS adapts the smoothing directionality based on the\nproperties of the underlying function, aligning better with complex loss\nlandscapes and improving convergence. The anisotropy is computed by adjusting\nthe covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution, allowing for directional\nsmoothing tailored to the gradient's behavior. This technique mitigates the\nimpact of minor fluctuations, enabling the algorithms to approach global minima\nmore effectively. We provide detailed convergence analyses that extend the\nresults from both the original (unsmoothed) methods and the IGS case to the\nmore general anisotropic smoothing, applicable to both convex and non-convex,\nL-smooth functions. In the stochastic setting, these algorithms converge to a\nnoisy ball, with its size determined by the smoothing parameters.

We first show that large girth does\nnot suffice: for all $k$, there exists a matroid of girth $\\geq k$ and a\nprophet inequality instance on that matroid whose optimal competitive ratio is\n$\\frac{1}{2}$. Next, we show $k$-fold matroid unions do suffice: we provide a\nprophet inequality with competitive ratio $1-O(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log k}{k}})$ for\nany $k$-fold matroid union. Our prophet inequality follows from an online\ncontention resolution scheme.\n  The key technical ingredient in our online contention resolution scheme is a\nnovel bicriterion concentration inequality for arbitrary monotone $1$-Lipschitz\nfunctions over independent items which may be of independent interest. Applied\nto our particular setting, our bicriterion concentration inequality yields\n\"Chernoff-strength\" concentration for a $1$-Lipschitz function that is not\n(approximately) self-bounding.",

In industry, a wide-used modeling architecture is a\ncascading paradigm: (1) first pre-training a multi-modal model to provide\nomnipotent representations for downstream services; (2) The downstream\nrecommendation model takes the multi-modal representation as additional input\nto fit real user-item behaviours. Although such paradigm achieves remarkable\nimprovements, however, there still exist two problems that limit model\nperformance: (1) Representation Unmatching: The pre-trained multi-modal model\nis always supervised by the classic NLP/CV tasks, while the recommendation\nmodels are supervised by real user-item interaction. As a result, the two\nfundamentally different tasks' goals were relatively separate, and there was a\nlack of consistent objective on their representations; (2) Representation\nUnlearning: The generated multi-modal representations are always stored in\ncache store and serve as extra fixed input of recommendation model, thus could\nnot be updated by recommendation model gradient, further unfriendly for\ndownstream training. Inspired by the two difficulties challenges in downstream\ntasks usage, we introduce a quantitative multi-modal framework to customize the\nspecialized and trainable multi-modal information for different downstream\nmodels.",

This framework does\nnot impose any distributional assumptions on the outcomes, covariates and their\ndependence, and utilizes only randomization as the \"reasoned basis\". We first\nderive the asymptotic theory for Z-estimation in completely randomized\nexperiments, and propose sandwich-type conservative covariance estimation. We\nthen apply the developed theory to analyze both average and individual\ntreatment effects in randomized experiments. For the average treatment effect,\nwe consider three estimation strategies: model-based, model-imputed, and\nmodel-assisted, where the first two can be sensitive to model misspecification\nor require specific ways for parameter estimation. The model-assisted approach\nis robust to arbitrary model misspecification and always provides consistent\naverage treatment effect estimation. We propose optimal ways to conduct\nmodel-assisted estimation using generally nonlinear least squares for parameter\nestimation. For the individual treatment effects, we propose to directly model\nthe relationship between individual effects and covariates, and discuss the\nmodel's identifiability, inference and interpretation allowing model\nmisspecification.",

To maintain the rapid design\nbenefit of additive manufacturing, this joint control strategy employs a\ndisturbance observer (DOB) modeled from an ideal elastic actuator. This robust\ncontroller treats the model variation from the structurally elastic components\nas a disturbance and eliminates the need for system identification of the 3D\nprinted parts. This enables mechanical design engineers to iterate on the 3D\nprinted linkages without requiring consistent tuning from the joint controller.\nTwo sets of hardware results are presented for validating the controller. The\nfirst set of results are conducted on an ideal elastic actuator testbed that\ndrives an unmodeled, 1 DoF weighted pendulum with a 10 kg mass. The results\nsupport the claim that the DOB can handle significant model variation. The\nsecond set of results is from a robust balancing experiment conducted on the 12\nDoF lower body of PANDORA.

So far, these type of wideband\nmeasurements are not found in the literature. Periodic orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing (OFMD) sounding signals using Zadoff-Chu sequences have\nbeen specially designed for this purpose. The collected data has been\npost-processed to estimate the time-variant impulse and frequency responses and\nrelevant parameters for system design like the time coherence, bandwidth\ncoherence, delay spread and Doppler bandwidth. The statistical behavior of the\nchannel gain random fluctuation has also been analyzed. This information has\nbeen extracted for both the global channel and each path separately. The wide\nbandwidth of the measurements have allowed the characterization of the channel\nin a scarcely explored ultrasonic band with an accuracy that is far beyond what\nis reported in previous works.",

We uncover two distinct regimes: a constant gain regime, where\ndisentangling is volume-independent, and a log-gain regime, where\ndisentanglement increases with volume, characterized by a reduced effective\ncentral charge. In both cases, disentangling efficiency correlates with the\ntarget state magic, with larger magic leading to more effective cooling.

The\nprofound relationship between a planar graph and its dual has been the\nalgorithmic basis for solving numerous (centralized) classical problems on\nplanar graphs. In the distributed setting however, the only use of planar\nduality is for finding a recursive decomposition of $G$ [DISC 2017, STOC 2019].\n  We extend the distributed algorithmic toolkit to work on the dual graph\n$G^*$. These tools can then facilitate various algorithms on $G$ by solving a\nsuitable dual problem on $G^*$.\n  Given a directed planar graph $G$ with positive and negative edge-lengths and\nhop-diameter $D$, our key result is an $\\tilde{O}(D^2)$-round algorithm for\nSingle Source Shortest Paths on $G^*$, which then implies\n$\\tilde{O}(D^2)$-round algorithms for Maximum $st$-Flow and Directed Global\nMin-Cut on $G$. Prior to our work, no $\\tilde{O}(\\text{poly}(D))$-round\nalgorithm was known for those problems. We further obtain a $D\\cdot\nn^{o(1)}$-rounds $(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for Maximum $st$-Flow\non $G$ when $G$ is undirected and $st$-planar. Finally, we give a near optimal\n$\\tilde O(D)$-round algorithm for computing the weighted girth of $G$. The main\nchallenges in our work are that $G^*$ is not the communication graph (e.g., a\nvertex of $G$ is mapped to multiple vertices of $G^*$), and that the diameter\nof $G^*$ can be much larger than $D$ (i.e., possibly by a linear factor). We\novercome these challenges by carefully defining and maintaining subgraphs of\nthe dual graph $G^*$ while applying the recursive decomposition on the primal\ngraph $G$. The main technical difficulty, is that along the recursive\ndecomposition, a face of $G$ gets shattered into (disconnected) components yet\nwe still need to treat it as a dual node.",

To advance\nmulti-concept personalization research, we further contribute a high-quality\ninstruction tuning dataset.

As Bitcoin experiences more halving events, the protocol\nreward converges to zero, making transaction fees the primary source of miner\nrewards. This shift in Bitcoin's incentivization mechanism, which introduces\nvolatility into block rewards, leads to the emergence of new security threats\nor intensifies existing ones. Previous security analyses of Bitcoin have either\nconsidered a fixed block reward model or a highly simplified volatile model,\noverlooking the complexities of Bitcoin's mempool behavior.\n  This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based tool to develop mining\nstrategies under a more realistic volatile model. We employ the Asynchronous\nAdvantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm, which efficiently handles dynamic\nenvironments, such as the Bitcoin mempool, to derive near-optimal mining\nstrategies when interacting with an environment that models the complexity of\nthe Bitcoin mempool. This tool enables the analysis of adversarial mining\nstrategies, such as selfish mining and undercutting, both before and after\ndifficulty adjustments, providing insights into the effects of mining attacks\nin both the short and long term.\n  We revisit the Bitcoin security threshold presented in the WeRLman paper and\ndemonstrate that the implicit predictability of valuable transaction arrivals\nin this model leads to an underestimation of the reported threshold.\nAdditionally, we show that, while adversarial strategies like selfish mining\nunder the fixed reward model incur an initial loss period of at least two\nweeks, the transition toward a transaction-fee era incentivizes mining pools to\nabandon honest mining for immediate profits. This incentive is expected to\nbecome more significant as the protocol reward approaches zero in the future.",

    "abstract": "Using different laser irradiation patterns to modify of silicon surface, it\nhas been demonstrated that, at rather small overlapping between irradiation\nspots, highly regular laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) can be\nproduced already starting from the second laser pulse, provided that\npolarization direction coincides with the scanning direction. If the laser\nirradiation spot is shifted from the previous one perpendicular to light\npolarization, LIPSS are not formed even after many pulses. This coherence\neffect is explained by a three-wave interference, - surface electromagnetic\nwaves (SEWs) generated within the irradiated spot, SEWs scattered from the\ncrater edge formed by the previous laser pulse, and the incoming laser pulse, -\nproviding conditions for amplification of the periodic light-absorption\npattern. To study possible consequences of SEW scattering from the\nlaser-modified regions, where the refractive index can change due to material\nmelting, amorphization, and the residual stress formed by previous laser\npulses, hydrodynamic modelling and simulations have been performed within the\nmelting regime. The simulations show that stress and vertical displacement\ncould be amplified upon laser scanning. Both mechanisms, three-wave\ninterference and stress accumulation, could enable an additional degree of\ncontrolling surface structuring.",

First, we derive a new\ninformation structure of the NRDF for Markov sources and single-letter\ndistortions. Second, we derive new convexity results on the NRDF, which\nfacilitate the use of Lagrange duality theorem to cast the problem as an\nunconstrained partially observable finite-time horizon stochastic dynamic\nprogramming (DP) algorithm subject to a probabilistic state (belief state) that\nsummarizes the past information about the reproduction symbols and takes values\nin a continuous state space. Instead of approximating the DP algorithm\ndirectly, we use Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to find an implicit\nclosed-form expression of the optimal control policy of the stochastic DP\n(i.e., the minimizing distribution of the NRDF) and approximate the control\npolicy and the cost-to-go function (a function of the rate) stage-wise, via a\nnovel dynamic alternating minimization (AM) approach, that is realized by an\noffline algorithm operating using backward recursions, with provable\nconvergence guarantees. We obtain the clean values of the aforementioned\nquantities using an online (forward) algorithm operating for any finite-time\nhorizon. Our methodology provides an approximate solution to the exact NRDF\nsolution, which becomes near-optimal as the search space of the belief state\nbecomes sufficiently large at each time stage.

In one state, the protein forms condensed\ndroplets through attractive interactions, while in the other state, the\nproteins remain dispersed.

    "abstract": "We critically review the evidence for time-varying dark energy from recent\nBaryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Supernova (SN) observations. First, we\nshow that such evidence is present at the 3$\\sigma$ level, even without the new\nBAO data from the dark energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), by instead using\nBAO data from the dark energy Survey (DES), combined with the DES5Y supernovae\nand Planck CMB data. Next, we examine the role of the DES5Y supernova dataset,\nshowing that the preference for time-varying dark energy is driven by the low\nredshift supernovae common to both the DES5Y and Pantheon+ compilations. We\nfind that combining Pantheon+ and DES5Y supernovae by removing the common\nsupernovae leads to two different results, depending on whether they are\nremoved from the DES5Y or the Pantheon+ catalog, leading to stronger or weaker\nexclusion of $\\Lambda$CDM, at the (3.8$\\sigma$) and (2.5$\\sigma$) level,\nrespectively. These common supernovae have smaller error bars in DES5Y compared\nto Pantheon+, and, as recently pointed out, there is an offset in magnitude in\nDES5Y between supernovae at ($z > 0.1$), where almost all the measurements\ntaken during the full five years of DES are, and the low-redshift ones ($z <\n0.1$), where all the historical set of nearby supernovae lies. We show that\nmarginalizing over such an offset in DES5Y would lead to significantly weaker\nevidence for evolving dark energy.",

In this context, a growth routine using borazine as a\nsurfactant molecule on SiC(0001) surfaces has been reported, leading to the\nformation of high-quality epitaxial graphene layers that are unconventionally\noriented, i.e., aligned with the substrate lattice (G-$R0^\\circ$) [Bocquet et\nal.

Since the G-$R0^\\circ$ layer sits on\na buffer layer, also known as zeroth-layer graphene (ZLG), which is rotated\n$30^\\circ$ with respect to the SiC substrate and still covalently bonded to it,\ndecoupling the ZLG-$R30^\\circ$ from the substrate can lead to high-quality\ntwisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). Here we report the decoupling of\nZLG-$R30^\\circ$ by increasing the temperature during annealing in a borazine\natmosphere. While this converts ZLG-$R30^\\circ$ to G-$R30^\\circ$ and thus\nproduces tBLG, the growth process at elevated temperature is no longer\nself-limiting, so that the surface is covered by a patchwork of graphene\nmultilayers of different thicknesses. We find a 20% coverage of tBLG on ZLG,\nwhile on the rest of the surface tBLG sits on one or more additional graphene\nlayers. In order to achieve complete coverage with tBLG only, alternative ways\nof decoupling the ZLG, e.g., by intercalation with suitable atoms, may be\nadvantageous.",

However, existing backdoor efforts are limited to\nsimulators and suffer from physical-world realization. To address this, we\npropose \\textit{TrojanRobot}, a highly stealthy and broadly effective robotic\nbackdoor attack in the physical world. Specifically, we introduce a\nmodule-poisoning approach by embedding a backdoor module into the modular\nrobotic policy, enabling backdoor control over the policy's visual perception\nmodule thereby backdooring the entire robotic policy. Our vanilla\nimplementation leverages a backdoor-finetuned VLM to serve as the backdoor\nmodule. To enhance its generalization in physical environments, we propose a\nprime implementation, leveraging the LVLM-as-a-backdoor paradigm and developing\nthree types of prime attacks, \\ie, \\textit{permutation}, \\textit{stagnation},\nand \\textit{intentional} attacks, thus achieving finer-grained backdoors.\nExtensive experiments on the UR3e manipulator with 18 task instructions using\nrobotic policies based on four VLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness and\nphysical-world stealth of TrojanRobot.

The main challenge arises from the non-Euclidean\nnature of the output space, which generally requires relaxing the problem\nformulation. Surrogate methods build on kernel-induced losses or more\ngenerally, loss functions admitting an Implicit Loss Embedding, and convert the\noriginal problem into a regression task followed by a decoding step. However,\ndesigning effective losses for objects with complex structures presents\nsignificant challenges and often requires domain-specific expertise. In this\nwork, we introduce a novel framework in which a structured loss function,\nparameterized by neural networks, is learned directly from output training data\nthrough Contrastive Learning, prior to addressing the supervised surrogate\nregression problem. As a result, the differentiable loss not only enables the\nlearning of neural networks due to the finite dimension of the surrogate space\nbut also allows for the prediction of new structures of the output data via a\ndecoding strategy based on gradient descent.

In this\nwork, two models are considered for the background light source, namely the\ncelestial light source model and the thin accretion disk model. Regarding the\ncelestial light source, the investigation focuses on the impact of variations\nin relevant parameters and observed inclination on the contour and size of the\nshadow. For the thin accretion disk model, the optical appearance of a black\nhole is evidently contingent upon the radiative properties exhibited by the\naccretion disk, as well as factors such as observed inclination and relevant\nparameters governing spacetime. With an increasing observation inclination, the\nobserved flux of direct and lensed images of the accretion disk gradually\nconverge towards the lower region of the image, while an increase in the dark\nmatter parameter $a$ significantly expands the region encompassing both direct\nand lensed images. Furthermore, the predominant effect is redshift at lower\nobservation angles, whereas the blueshift effect only becomes apparent at\nhigher observation angles. Simultaneously, the increase in the observation\ninclination will amplify the redshift effect, whereas an increase in the\nmagnetic charge $\\mathcal{G}$, rotation parameter $a$ and the absolute value of\ndark matter parameter $\\alpha$ will attenuate the redshift effect observed in\nthe image.

Existing research has primarily concentrated on\nthe adversary's execution of black-box attacks through data-free model\nextraction. However, a significant gap remains in the literature concerning the\ndevelopment of surrogate models by adversaries with access to few-shot raw data\n(10\\% even less). That is, the challenge of how to construct a surrogate model\nwith high functional similarity within the context of few-shot data scenarios\nremains an issue that requires resolution.This study addresses this gap by\nintroducing a novel few-shot model extraction framework against sequential\nrecommenders, which is designed to construct a superior surrogate model with\nthe utilization of few-shot data. The proposed few-shot model extraction\nframework is comprised of two components: an autoregressive augmentation\ngeneration strategy and a bidirectional repair loss-facilitated model\ndistillation procedure. Specifically, to generate synthetic data that closely\napproximate the distribution of raw data, autoregressive augmentation\ngeneration strategy integrates a probabilistic interaction sampler to extract\ninherent dependencies and a synthesis determinant signal module to characterize\nuser behavioral patterns. Subsequently, bidirectional repair loss, which target\nthe discrepancies between the recommendation lists, is designed as auxiliary\nloss to rectify erroneous predictions from surrogate models, transferring\nknowledge from the victim model to the surrogate model effectively.

We propose a nonparametric Bayesian approach for borrowing\nhistorical controls that are homogeneous with the current control.\nAdditionally, to emphasize the resolution of conflicts between the historical\ncontrols and current control, we introduce a method based on the dependent\nDirichlet process mixture.

The proposed method based on the\ndependent Dirichlet process mixture can more accurately borrow from homogeneous\nhistorical controls while reducing the impact of heterogeneous historical\ncontrols compared to the typical Dirichlet process mixture. The proposed\nmethods outperform existing methods in scenarios with heterogeneous historical\ncontrols, in which the meta-analytic approach is ineffective.",

    "abstract": "Rooted in the explosion of deep learning over the past decade, this thesis\nspans from AlphaGo to ChatGPT to empirically examine the fundamental concepts\nneeded to realize the vision of an artificial scientist: a machine with the\ncapacity to autonomously generate original research and contribute to the\nexpansion of human knowledge. The investigation begins with Olivaw, an AlphaGo\nZero-like agent that discovers Othello knowledge from scratch but is unable to\ncommunicate it. This realization leads to the development of the Explanatory\nLearning (EL) framework, a formalization of the problem faced by a scientist\nwhen trying to explain a new phenomenon to their peers. The effective EL\nprescriptions allow us to crack Zendo, a popular board game simulating the\nscientific endeavor. This success comes with a fundamental insight: an\nartificial scientist must develop its own interpretation of the language used\nto explain its findings, and not rely on a rigid existing interpreter.\nQuestioning the very process of learning an interpreter, we turn our attention\nto the inner functioning of modern multimodal models. This culminates in a\nsimple idea to build CLIP-like models where interpretation and perception are\nexplicitly disentangled: a cost-effective approach that couples two unimodal\nmodels using little multimodal data and no further training. Finally, we\ndiscuss what ChatGPT and its siblings are still missing to become artificial\nscientists, and introduce the Big-Bench Symbol Interpretation Task, a benchmark\nabout interpreting Zendo-like explanations that sees LLMs going no further than\nrandom chance while being instead fully solved by humans.",

    "abstract": "Camera traps, combined with AI, have emerged as a way to achieve automated,\nscalable biodiversity monitoring. However, the passive infrared (PIR) sensors\nthat trigger camera traps are poorly suited for detecting small, fast-moving\nectotherms such as insects. Insects comprise over half of all animal species\nand are key components of ecosystems and agriculture. The need for an\nappropriate and scalable insect camera trap is critical in the wake of\nconcerning reports of declines in insect populations. This study proposes an\nalternative to the PIR trigger: ultra-lightweight convolutional neural networks\nrunning on low-powered hardware to detect insects in a continuous stream of\ncaptured images. We train a suite of models to distinguish insect images from\nbackgrounds. Our design achieves zero latency between trigger and image\ncapture. Our models are rigorously tested and achieve high accuracy ranging\nfrom 91.8% to 96.4% AUC on validation data and >87% AUC on data from\ndistributions unseen during training. The high specificity of our models\nensures minimal saving of false positive images, maximising deployment storage\nefficiency. High recall scores indicate a minimal false negative rate,\nmaximising insect detection. Further analysis with saliency maps shows the\nlearned representation of our models to be robust, with low reliance on\nspurious background features. Our system is also shown to operate deployed on\noff-the-shelf, low-powered microcontroller units, consuming a maximum power\ndraw of less than 300mW. This enables longer deployment times using cheap and\nreadily available battery components. Overall we offer a step change in the\ncost, efficiency and scope of insect monitoring. Solving the challenging\ntrigger problem, we demonstrate a system which can be deployed for far longer\nthan existing designs and budgets power and bandwidth effectively, moving\ntowards a generic insect camera trap.",

This frequently leads to\nrobustness issues and hallucinations, ultimately causing performance\ndegradation. Data valuation is an efficient way to detect and trace these\nmisalignments. Nevertheless, existing methods are computationally expensive for\nlarge-scale models. Although computationally efficient, classical influence\nfunctions are inadequate for contrastive learning models, as they were\ninitially designed for pointwise loss. Furthermore, contrastive learning\ninvolves minimizing the distance between positive sample modalities while\nmaximizing the distance between negative sample modalities. This necessitates\nevaluating the influence of samples from both perspectives. To tackle these\nchallenges, we introduce the Extended Influence Function for Contrastive Loss\n(ECIF), an influence function crafted for contrastive loss. ECIF considers both\npositive and negative samples and provides a closed-form approximation of\ncontrastive learning models, eliminating the need for retraining. Building upon\nECIF, we develop a series of algorithms for data evaluation, misalignment\ndetection, and misprediction trace-back tasks. Experimental results demonstrate\nour ECIF advances the transparency and interpretability of CLIP-style embedding\nmodels by offering a more accurate assessment of data impact and model\nalignment compared to traditional baseline methods.",

This study aims to assist fashion\nshopping website developers in improving the usability of their platforms by\nproviding an intelligent approach that can evaluate website usability.

The datasets for this project were custom-built, comprising\na textual dataset for the SVM model and a screenshot dataset for the CNN model.\nThe results demonstrate that the SVM model achieved an impressive 99% accuracy,\nwhile the CNN model attained 69% accuracy.

We furthermore discuss its\nimplications in a truncated unity solver, where a restricted number of form\nfactors introduces an information loss in the projection of the momentum\ndependence that in general affects the equivalence between the different\nchannel representations. In the application to the functional renormalization\ngroup, we find that the convergence in the number of form factors depends on\nthe channel representation of the SDE.

    "abstract": "The application of Tensor Networks (TN) in quantum computing has shown\npromise, particularly for data loading. However, the assumption that data is\nreadily available often renders the integration of TN techniques into Quantum\nMonte Carlo (QMC) inefficient, as complete probability distributions would have\nto be calculated classically. In this paper the tensor-train cross\napproximation (TT-cross) algorithm is evaluated as a means to address the\nprobability loading problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on\nfinancial distributions, showcasing the TT-cross approach's scalability and\naccuracy. Our results indicate that the TT-cross method significantly improves\ncircuit depth scalability compared to traditional methods, offering a more\nefficient pathway for implementing QMC on near-term quantum hardware. The\napproach also shows high accuracy and scalability in handling high-dimensional\nfinancial data, making it a promising solution for quantum finance\napplications.",

    "abstract": "The changesets (or patches) that fix open source software vulnerabilities\nform critical datasets for various machine learning security-enhancing\napplications, such as automated vulnerability patching and silent fix\ndetection. These patch datasets are derived from extensive collections of\nhistorical vulnerability fixes, maintained in databases like the Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures list and the National Vulnerability Database.\nHowever, since these databases focus on rapid notification to the security\ncommunity, they contain significant inaccuracies and omissions that have a\nnegative impact on downstream software security quality assurance tasks.\n  In this paper, we propose an approach employing Uncertainty Quantification\n(UQ) to curate datasets of publicly-available software vulnerability patches.\nOur methodology leverages machine learning models that incorporate UQ to\ndifferentiate between patches based on their potential utility. We begin by\nevaluating a number of popular UQ techniques, including Vanilla, Monte Carlo\nDropout, and Model Ensemble, as well as homoscedastic and heteroscedastic\nmodels of noise. Our findings indicate that Model Ensemble and heteroscedastic\nmodels are the best choices for vulnerability patch datasets. Based on these UQ\nmodeling choices, we propose a heuristic that uses UQ to filter out lower\nquality instances and select instances with high utility value from the\nvulnerability dataset. Using our approach, we observe an improvement in\npredictive performance and significant reduction of model training time (i.e.,\nenergy consumption) for a state-of-the-art vulnerability prediction model.",

    "abstract": "Human activity recognition, facilitated by smart devices, has recently\ngarnered significant attention. Deep learning algorithms have become pivotal in\ndaily activities, sports, and healthcare. Nevertheless, addressing the\nchallenge of extracting features from sensor data processing necessitates the\nutilization of diverse algorithms in isolation, subsequently transforming them\ninto a standard mode. This research introduces a novel approach called\nIHARDS-CNN, amalgamating data from three distinct datasets (UCI-HAR, WISDM, and\nKU-HAR) for human activity recognition. The data collected from sensors\nembedded in smartwatches or smartphones encompass five daily activity classes.\nThis study initially outlines the dataset integration approach, follows with a\ncomprehensive statistical analysis, and assesses dataset accuracy. The proposed\nmethodology employs a one-dimensional deep convolutional neural network for\nclassification. Compared to extant activity recognition methods, this approach\nstands out for its high speed, reduced detection steps, and absence of the need\nto aggregate classified results. Despite fewer detection steps, empirical\nresults demonstrate an impressive accuracy of nearly 100%, marking it the\nhighest among existing methods. Evaluation outcomes further highlight superior\nclassification performance when compared to analogous architectures.",

Here, we use acoustic tweezers to lift\ncatalytically active Janus spheres away from the wall to study their motion in\nbulk and when approaching a wall. Mean-squared displacement analysis shows that\ndiffusion constants at different heights match with Fax\\'en's prediction for\nthe near-wall hydrodynamic mobility. Both particles close to a substrate and in\nbulk show a decrease in velocity with increasing salt concentration, suggesting\nthat the dominant factor for the decrease in speed is a reduction of the\nswimmer-based propulsion. The velocity-height profile follows a hydrodynamic\nscaling relation as well, implying a coupling between the wall and the swimming\nspeed. The observed speed reduction upon addition of salt matches expectations\nfrom a electrokinetic theory, except for experiments in 0.1 wt% hydrogen\nperoxide in bulk, which could indicate contributions from a different\npropulsion mechanism. Our results help with the understanding of ionic effects\non microswimmers in 3D and point to a coupling between the wall and the\nparticle that affects its self-propulsion speed.",

    "abstract": "Investigating students' thinking in classroom tasks, particularly in science\nand engineering, is essential for improving educational practices and advancing\nstudent learning. In this context, the notion of Ways of Thinking (WoT) has\ngained traction in STEM education, offering a framework to explore how students\napproach and solve interdisciplinary problems. Building on our earlier studies\nand contributing to ongoing discussions on WoT frameworks, this paper\nintroduces a new WoT framework: Ways of Thinking in Engineering Design based\nPhysics (WoT4EDP). WoT4EDP integrates five key elements: design, science,\nmathematics, metacognitive reflection, and computational thinking within an\nundergraduate introductory physics laboratory. This framework offers a novel\nperspective by emphasizing how these interconnected elements work together to\nfoster deeper learning and holistic problem-solving in Engineering Design based\nprojects. A key takeaway is that this framework serves as a practical tool for\neducators and researchers to design, implement, and analyze interdisciplinary\nSTEM activities in physics classrooms. We describe the development of WoT4EDP,\nsituate it within the broader landscape of undergraduate STEM education, and\nprovide detailed characterizations of its components. Additionally, we compare\nWoT4EDP with two contemporary frameworks: Dalal et al. (2021) and English\n(2023), to glean insights that enhance its application and promote\ninterdisciplinary thinking. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In\nthe upcoming second part, we will demonstrate the application of the WoT4EDP\nframework, showcasing how it can be used to analyze student thinking in\nreal-world, ED-based physics projects.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful tool for sequential\ndecision-making, but its application is often hindered by privacy concerns\narising from its interaction data. This challenge is particularly acute in\nadvanced Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), where learning from operational and user\ndata can expose systems to privacy inference attacks. Existing differential\nprivacy (DP) models for RL are often inadequate: the centralized model requires\na fully trusted server, creating a single point of failure risk, while the\nlocal model incurs significant performance degradation that is unsuitable for\nmany control applications. This paper addresses this gap by leveraging the\nemerging shuffle model of privacy, an intermediate trust model that provides\nstrong privacy guarantees without a centralized trust assumption. We present\nShuffle Differentially Private Policy Elimination (SDP-PE), the first generic\npolicy elimination-based algorithm for episodic RL under the shuffle model. Our\nmethod introduces a novel exponential batching schedule and a ``forgetting''\nmechanism to balance the competing demands of privacy and learning performance.\nOur analysis shows that SDP-PE achieves a near-optimal regret bound,\ndemonstrating a superior privacy-regret trade-off that significantly\noutperforms the local model. This work establishes the viability of the shuffle\nmodel for secure data-driven control in advanced CPS.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the rapid growth of security vulnerabilities poses great\nchallenges to tracing and managing them. For example, it was reported that the\nNVD database experienced significant delays due to the shortage of maintainers.\nSuch delay creates challenges for third-party security personnel (e.g.,\nadministrators) to trace the information related to the CVE. To help security\npersonnel trace a vulnerability patch, we build a retrieval system that\nautomatically retrieves the patch in the repository.\n  Inspired by existing work on explainable machine learning, we ask the\nfollowing research question: can explanations help security maintainers make\ndecisions in patch tracing? First, we investigate using LIME (a widely used\nexplainable machine learning method) to highlight the rationale tokens in the\ncommit message and code. In addition, we propose an explanation method called\nTfIdf-Highlight, which leverages the Tf-Idf statistics to select the most\ninformative words in the repository and the dataset. We evaluate the\neffectiveness of highlighting using two experiments. First, we compare LIME and\nTfIdf-Highlight using a faithfulness score (i.e., sufficiency and\ncomprehensiveness) defined for ranking. We find that TfIdf-Highlight\nsignificantly outperforms LIME's sufficiency scores by 15\\% and slightly\noutperforms the comprehensiveness scores. Second, we conduct a blind human\nlabeling experiment by asking the annotators to guess the patch under 3\nsettings (TfIdf-Highlight, LIME, and no highlight). We find that the\nhelpfulness score for TfIdf-Highlight is higher than LIME while the labeling\naccuracies of LIME and TfIdf-Highlight are similar. Nevertheless, highlighting\ndoes not improve the accuracy over non-highlighting.",

Even for modern models that invoke\nrelatively small He shell masses, many previous studies have found that the\nproducts of the helium shell detonation lead to discrepancies with normal Type\nIa supernovae, such as strong Ti II absorption features, extremely red light\ncurves and too large a variation with viewing direction. It has been suggested\nthat non local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) effects may help to reduce\nthese discrepancies with observations. Here we carry out full non-LTE radiative\ntransfer simulations for a recent double detonation model with a relatively\nsmall helium shell mass of 0.05 M$_\\odot$. We construct 1D models\nrepresentative of directions in a 3D explosion model to give an indication of\nviewing angle dependence. The full non-LTE treatment leads to improved\nagreement between the models and observations. The light curves become less\nred, due to reduced absorption by the helium shell detonation products, since\nthese species are more highly ionised. Additionally, the expected variation\nwith observer direction is reduced. The full non-LTE treatment shows promising\nimprovements, and reduces the discrepancies between the double detonation\nmodels and observations of normal Type Ia supernovae.",

The reconstruction-based methods\nare the mainstream in this task, which learn point-wise representation via\nunsupervised learning. However, the unlabeled anomaly points in training data\nmay cause these reconstruction-based methods to learn and reconstruct anomalous\ndata, resulting in the challenge of capturing normal patterns. In this paper,\nwe propose a time series anomaly detection method based on implicit neural\nrepresentation (INR) reconstruction, named TSINR, to address this challenge.\nDue to the property of spectral bias, TSINR enables prioritizing low-frequency\nsignals and exhibiting poorer performance on high-frequency abnormal data.\nSpecifically, we adopt INR to parameterize time series data as a continuous\nfunction and employ a transformer-based architecture to predict the INR of\ngiven data. As a result, the proposed TSINR method achieves the advantage of\ncapturing the temporal continuity and thus is more sensitive to discontinuous\nanomaly data. In addition, we further design a novel form of INR continuous\nfunction to learn inter- and intra-channel information, and leverage a\npre-trained large language model to amplify the intense fluctuations in\nanomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSINR achieves superior\noverall performance on both univariate and multivariate time series anomaly\ndetection benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based\nmethods.

Weakly semi-supervised medical image\nsegmentation is an essential application because it only requires a small\namount of scribbles and a large number of unlabeled data to train the model,\nwhich greatly reduces the clinician's effort to fully annotate images. To\nhandle the inadequate supervisory information challenge in weakly\nsemi-supervised segmentation (WSSS), a SuperPixel-Propagated Pseudo-label\n(SP${}^3$) learning method is proposed, using the structural information\ncontained in superpixel for supplemental information. Specifically, the\nannotation of scribbles is propagated to superpixels and thus obtains a dense\nannotation for supervised training. Since the quality of pseudo-labels is\nlimited by the low-quality annotation, the beneficial superpixels selected by\ndynamic thresholding are used to refine pseudo-labels. Furthermore, aiming to\nalleviate the negative impact of noise in pseudo-label, superpixel-level\nuncertainty is incorporated to guide the pseudo-label supervision for stable\nlearning. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tumor and\norgan segmentation datasets under the WSSS setting, using only 3\\% of the\nannotation workload compared to fully supervised methods and attaining\napproximately 80\\% Dice score.

However, it\nis possible to construct Ramanujan graphs containing a small set $S$ with no\nmore than $0.5d|S|$ neighbors.

Specifically, the\nST-Tree model combines ST as the backbone network with an additional neural\ntree model. This integration allows us to fully leverage the advantages of ST\nin learning time series context while providing interpretable decision\nprocesses through the neural tree. This enables researchers to gain clear\ninsights into the model's decision-making process and extract meaningful\ninterpretations. Through experimental evaluations on 10 UEA datasets, we\ndemonstrate that the ST-Tree model improves accuracy in multivariate time\nseries classification tasks and provides interpretability through visualizing\nthe decision-making process across different datasets.",

Liquid\nphase exfoliation enables large-scale fabrication of thin films comprising\nsingle- and few-layer flakes of MoS$_2$ or other transition-metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDCs), exhibiting variations in flake size, geometry, edge\nterminations, and overlapping areas. Electronic conductivity of such films is\nthus determined by two contributions: the intraflake conductivity, reflecting\nthe value of each single layer, and charge transport across these overlapping\nflakes. Employing first-principles simulations, we investigate the influence of\nvarious edge terminations and of the overlap between flakes on the charge\ntransport in MoS$_2$ film models. We identify characteristic electronic edge\nstates originating from the edge atoms and their chemical environment, which\nresemble donor and acceptor states of doped semiconductors. This makes either\nelectrons or holes to majority carriers and enables selective control over the\ndominant charge carrier type (n-type or p-type). Compared to pristine\nnanosheets, overlapping flakes exhibit lower overall conductance. In the best\nperforming hexagonal flakes occurring in Mo-rich environments, the conductance\nis reduced by 20% compared to the pristine layer, while the drop by 40%, and\n50% is predicted for truncated triangular, and triangular flakes, respectively\nin S-rich environments.

    "abstract": "Determining potential probability distributions with a given causal graph is\nvital for causality studies. To bypass the difficulty in characterizing latent\nvariables in a Bayesian network, the nested Markov model provides an elegant\nalgebraic approach by listing exactly all the equality constraints on the\nobserved variables. However, this algebraically motivated causal model\ncomprises distributions outside Bayesian networks, and its physical\ninterpretation remains vague. In this work, we inspect the nested Markov model\nthrough the lens of generalized probabilistic theory, an axiomatic framework to\ndescribe general physical theories. We prove that all the equality constraints\ndefining the nested Markov model hold valid theory-independently. Yet, we show\nthis model generally contains distributions not implementable even within such\nrelaxed physical theories subjected to merely the relativity principles and\nmild probabilistic rules. To interpret the origin of such a gap, we establish a\nnew causal model that defines valid distributions as projected from a\nhigh-dimensional Bell-type causal structure. The new model unveils inequality\nconstraints induced by relativity principles, or equivalently high-dimensional\nconditional independences, which are absent in the nested Markov model.\nNevertheless, we also notice that the restrictions on states and measurements\nintroduced by the generalized probabilistic theory framework can pose\nadditional inequality constraints beyond the new causal model. As a by-product,\nwe discover a new causal structure exhibiting strict gaps between the\ndistribution sets of a Bayesian network, generalized probabilistic theories,\nand the nested Markov model.

Although these studies had been restricted to\nsums where the nominator consists of a product of even or odd hyperharmonic\nsums, where the denominator is of the type $1/k^n$. We have generalized these\nresults to nonlinear Euler sums with different denominators and nominators\nwhich consist in addition of mixed products between even and odd hyperharmonic\nnumbers. In detail we present eight families of quadratic Euler sums which are\nexpressible by zeta values and special types of linear Euler sums only where\nthe order of the nonlinear Euler sums is always an odd number. The resulting\neight different families of nonlinear Euler sums which we discovered consist of\nvarious products between even and odd hyperharmonic numbers, divided by three\ndifferent types of denominators $1/k^n$, $1/((2k-1)^n)$ and $1/(k(2k-1))$.

In this work, we demonstrate the existence of \"pseudo forgetting\":\nthe performance degradation on previous tasks is not attributed to a loss of\ncapabilities, but rather to the failure of the instructions to activate the\nappropriate model abilities. We show that the model's performance on previous\ntasks can be restored through two simple interventions: (1) providing partial\nexternal correct rationale, and (2) appending semantically meaningless suffixes\nto the original instructions, to guide the generation of correct rationales.\nThrough empirical analysis of the internal mechanisms governing rationale\ngeneration, we reveal that models exhibiting pseudo forgetting show reduced\ninstruction dependence during rationale generation, leading to suboptimal\nactivation of their inherent capabilities. Based on this insight, we propose\nRationale-Guidance Difficulty based Replay (RGD-R) framework that dynamically\nallocates replay data based on the model's ability to correctly leverage the\nintrinsic capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that RGD-R effectively\nmitigates pseudo forgetting while maintaining model plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Network Intrusion Detection (NID) remains a key area of research within the\ninformation security community, while also being relevant to Machine Learning\n(ML) practitioners. The latter generally aim to detect attacks using network\nfeatures, which have been extracted from raw network data typically using\ndimensionality reduction methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA).\nHowever, PCA is not able to assess the relevance of features for the task at\nhand. Consequently, the features available are of varying quality, with some\nbeing entirely non-informative. From this, two major drawbacks arise. Firstly,\ntrained and deployed models have to process large amounts of unnecessary data,\ntherefore draining potentially costly resources. Secondly, the noise caused by\nthe presence of irrelevant features can, in some cases, impede a model's\nability to detect an attack. In order to deal with these challenges, we present\nFeature Selection for Network Intrusion Detection (FSNID) a novel\ninformation-theoretic method that facilitates the exclusion of non-informative\nfeatures when detecting network intrusions. The proposed method is based on\nfunction approximation using a neural network, which enables a version of our\napproach that incorporates a recurrent layer. Consequently, this version\nuniquely enables the integration of temporal dependencies. Through an extensive\nset of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method selects a\nsignificantly reduced feature set, while maintaining NID performance.

One such example is a population's size, which changes in\ndiscrete generations which we label by $n$ ($= 0, 1, 2, . ..$). There are some\nexactly soluble cases where the population's size at discrete time $n$, written\n$x_{n}$, can be related to a different problem, where change occurs in\ncontinuous time, $t$, and the population's size is then written as $x(t)$. The\nrelation is that $x(t = n)$ precisely coincides with $x_{n}$. In such a case,\nwe say the two models are 'equivalent', even though $x_{n}$ obeys a difference\nequation and $x(t)$ obeys a differential equation. A comparison of the\ndifference equation and the differential equation allows us to make a\ncorrespondence between coefficients in these equations. This exposes structural\nsimilarities and sometimes appreciable structural differences of discrete and\ncontinuous time dynamics. We present cases of such equivalences for both time\nhomogeneous and time inhomogeneous problems. Beyond this, when the equation\nthat $x_{n}$ obeys is modified so there is no exact solution, we show how to\nconstruct an approximate continuous time solution that can capture rapid\nchange, such as growth, of $x_{n}$. Additionally, in some discrete time\nproblems, the solution has an oscillatory component that changes sign as $n\n\\rightarrow n + 1$. We show that the way an equivalent continuous time solution\nreplicates this oscillatory behaviour is to become complex. We give concrete\nexamples of this 'complexification' of the continuous time solution, which is\nreal at $t = 0,1,2,...$ but is complex away from the integers.",

In contrast to existing wall-models, the\nVF-WMLES framework does not rely on temporal averaging, does not make a priori\nassumptions on the pressure gradient, and can be used with a uniform spatial\nfilter, which avoids the appearance of commutation closures in spatial\nderivatives of the filtered momentum and continuity equation. Volume-filtering\nis well-defined, even close to the wall, and it is shown that a non-zero slip\nand penetration velocity at the wall is a direct consequence of\nvolume-filtering the flow. With the VF-WMLES concept, new wall models can be\ndirectly assessed in a priori and a posteriori studies by comparing the\npredicted slip and penetration velocities at the wall with the velocities from\nexplicitly volume-filtered direct numerical simulations (DNS). Based on the\nVF-WMLES concept, we derive an LES modeling strategy that is based on the\nrecently proposed PC-IBM, a modeling framework based on volume-filtering\nallowing to couple the flow with arbitrarily shaped solid boundaries using\nrelatively coarse Cartesian fluid meshes.

However, to compete with conventional\nelectronics, it is necessary to develop universal and fast methods for\ncontrolling and reading the valley quantum number of the electrons. Even though\nselective optical manipulation of electron populations in inequivalent valleys\nhas been demonstrated in two-dimensional crystals with broken time-reversal\nsymmetry, such control is highly desired in many technologically important\nsemiconductor materials, including silicon and diamond. We demonstrate an\nultrafast technique for the generation and read-out of a valley-polarized\npopulation of electrons in bulk semiconductors on subpicosecond timescales. The\nprinciple is based on the unidirectional intervalley scattering of electrons\naccelerated by an oscillating electric field of linearly polarized infrared\nfemtosecond pulses. Our results are an advance in the development of potential\nroom-temperature valleytronic devices operating at terahertz frequencies and\ncompatible with contemporary silicon-based technology.",

    "abstract": "We live in a world full of complex systems which we need to improve our\nunderstanding of. To accomplish this, purely probabilistic investigations are\noften not enough. They are only the first step and must be followed by learning\nthe system's underlying mechanisms. This is what the discipline of causality is\nconcerned with. Many of those complex systems contain feedback loops which\nmeans that our methods have to allow for cyclic causal relations. Furthermore,\nsystems are rarely sufficiently isolated, which means that there are usually\nhidden confounders, i.e., unmeasured variables that each causally affects more\nthan one measured variable. Finally, data is often distorted by contaminating\nprocesses, and we need to apply methods that are robust against such\ndistortions. That's why we consider the robustness of LLC, see \\cite{llc}, one\nof the few causal analysis methods that can deal with cyclic models with hidden\nconfounders. Following a theoretical analysis of LLC's robustness properties,\nwe also provide robust extensions of LLC.

This study aims to fill that gap by quantifying the impact of the\nEuropean Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on online usage\nbehavior over time. We analyzed data from 6,286 websites across 24 industries,\ncovering 10 months before and 18 months after the GDPR's enactment in 2018.\nEmploying a generalized synthetic control estimator, we isolated the short- and\nlong-term effects of the GDPR on user behavior. Our results show that the GDPR\nnegatively affected online usage per website on average; specifically, weekly\nvisits decreased by 4.88% in the first 3 months and 10.02% after 18 months\npost-enactment. At the 18-month mark, these declines translated into average\nrevenue losses of about USD 7 million for e-commerce websites and nearly USD\n2.5 million for ad-based websites. Nonetheless, the GDPR's impact varied across\nwebsite size, industry, and user origin, with some large websites and\nindustries benefiting from the regulation.

    "abstract": "Online shopping platforms, such as Amazon and AliExpress, are increasingly\nprevalent in society, helping customers purchase products conveniently. With\nrecent progress in natural language processing, researchers and practitioners\nshift their focus from traditional product search to conversational product\nsearch. Conversational product search enables user-machine conversations and\nthrough them collects explicit user feedback that allows to actively clarify\nthe users' product preferences. Therefore, prospective research on an\nintelligent shopping assistant via conversations is indispensable. Existing\npublications on conversational product search either model conversations\nindependently from users, queries, and products or lead to a vocabulary\nmismatch. In this work, we propose a new conversational product search model,\nConvPS, to assist users in locating desirable items. The model is first trained\nto jointly learn the semantic representations of user, query, item, and\nconversation via a unified generative framework. After learning these\nrepresentations, they are integrated to retrieve the target items in the latent\nsemantic space. Meanwhile, we propose a set of greedy and explore-exploit\nstrategies to learn to ask the user a sequence of high-performance questions\nfor conversations. Our proposed ConvPS model can naturally integrate the\nrepresentation learning of the user, query, item, and conversation into a\nunified generative framework, which provides a promising avenue for\nconstructing accurate and robust conversational product search systems that are\nflexible and adaptive. Experimental results demonstrate that our ConvPS model\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

In this note, we use contraction tools to study the\nexponential stability of a system to a particular known trajectory, deriving a\nnew LDI characterizing the error between arbitrary trajectories and this known\ntrajectory. As with classical contraction analysis, this new inclusion is\nconstructed via first partial derivatives of the system's vector field, and\nconvergence rates are obtained with familiar tools: uniform bounding of the\nlogarithmic norm and LMI-based Lyapunov conditions. Our LDI is guaranteed to\noutperform a usual contraction analysis in two special circumstances: i) when\nthe bound on the logarithmic norm arises from an interval overapproximation of\nthe Jacobian matrix, and ii) when the norm considered is the $\\ell_1$ norm.\nFinally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach strictly improves an existing\nframework for ellipsoidal reachable set computation.",

One such phenomenon,\nknown as Sondheimer oscillations, was discovered decades ago.

Here, we present a study of longitudinal and\ntransverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thicknesses ranging\nfrom 12.6 to 475 $\\mu$m, and demonstrate that the amplitude of the first ten\noscillations is determined by the quantum of conductance and a length scale\nthat depends on the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface\ngeometry. We argue that this scaling is unexpected in semiclassical scenarios\nand it arises from the degeneracy of the momentum derivative of the\ncross-sectional area $A$ along the orientation of the magnetic field\n$\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial k_z}$ in cadmium, which couples Landau quantization\nto the discretization of $k_z$ imposed by the finite sample thickness. We show\nthat the oscillating component of the conductivity is uniquely governed by\nfundamental constants and the ratio of two degeneracies, which acts as an\ninverted filling factor.

As a result, several LLM-based ABMs have been proposed in the\npast year. While they hold promise, each simulator is specifically designed to\nstudy a particular scenario, making it time-consuming and resource-intensive to\nexplore other phenomena using the same ABM. Additionally, these models simulate\nonly a limited number of agents, whereas real-world social media platforms\ninvolve millions of users. To this end, we propose OASIS, a generalizable and\nscalable social media simulator. OASIS is designed based on real-world social\nmedia platforms, incorporating dynamically updated environments (i.e., dynamic\nsocial networks and post information), diverse action spaces (i.e., following,\ncommenting), and recommendation systems (i.e., interest-based and\nhot-score-based). Additionally, OASIS supports large-scale user simulations,\ncapable of modeling up to one million users. With these features, OASIS can be\neasily extended to different social media platforms to study large-scale group\nphenomena and behaviors. We replicate various social phenomena, including\ninformation spreading, group polarization, and herd effects across X and Reddit\nplatforms. Moreover, we provide observations of social phenomena at different\nagent group scales. We observe that the larger agent group scale leads to more\nenhanced group dynamics and more diverse and helpful agents' opinions.

Such scenarios are\nfound to be possible only at very early times ($>\\,$4Gya), and are extremely\nunlikely settings for the initial stages of prebiotic chemistry, unless (i)\nferrocyanide salts are stable on 1000yr timescales in crater environments, (ii)\nthere was a particularly high impact rate on the Hadean Earth, and (iii)\nenvironmental conditions on the Hadean Earth were conducive to successful\ncometary delivery (i.e., limited oceanic coverage, and low ($\\lesssim 1$bar)\natmospheric surface pressure). Whilst environmental conditions on the early\nEarth remain subject to debate, this work highlights the need to measure the\ntypical lifetime of ferrocyanide salts in geochemically realistic environments,\nwhich will determine the plausibility of double impact scenarios.",

To calculate network cumulative\nconstraint violation, existing distributed bandit online algorithms solving\nthis problem directly use the clipped constraint function to replace its\noriginal constraint function. However, the use of the clipping operation\nrenders Slater condition (i.e, there exists a point that strictly satisfies the\ninequality constraints at all iterations) ineffective to achieve reduced\nnetwork cumulative constraint violation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a\nnew distributed bandit online primal-dual algorithm. If local loss functions\nare convex, we show that the proposed algorithm establishes sublinear network\nregret and cumulative constraint violation bounds. When Slater condition holds,\nthe network cumulative constraint violation bound is reduced. In addition, if\nlocal loss functions are strongly convex, for the case where strongly convex\nparameters are unknown, the network regret bound is reduced. For the case where\nstrongly convex parameters are known, the network regret and cumulative\nconstraint violation bounds are further reduced. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis paper is among the first to establish reduced (network) cumulative\nconstraint violation bounds for (distributed) bandit convex optimization with\ntime-varying constraints under Slater condition.

    "abstract": "Dysgraphia is a learning disorder that affects handwriting abilities, making\nit challenging for children to write legibly and consistently. Early detection\nand monitoring are crucial for providing timely support and interventions. This\nstudy applies deep learning techniques to address the dual tasks of dysgraphia\ndetection and optical character recognition (OCR) on handwriting samples from\nchildren with potential dysgraphic symptoms. Using a dataset of handwritten\nsamples from Malaysian schoolchildren, we developed a custom Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) model, alongside VGG16 and ResNet50, to classify\nhandwriting as dysgraphic or non-dysgraphic. The custom CNN model outperformed\nthe pre-trained models, achieving a test accuracy of 91.8% with high precision,\nrecall, and AUC, demonstrating its robustness in identifying dysgraphic\nhandwriting features. Additionally, an OCR pipeline was created to segment and\nrecognize individual characters in dysgraphic handwriting, achieving a\ncharacter recognition accuracy of approximately 43.5%. This research highlights\nthe potential of deep learning in supporting dysgraphia assessment, laying a\nfoundation for tools that could assist educators and clinicians in identifying\ndysgraphia and tracking handwriting progress over time. The findings contribute\nto advancements in assistive technologies for learning disabilities, offering\nhope for more accessible and accurate diagnostic tools in educational and\nclinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Hosting diverse large language model workloads in a unified resource pool\nthrough co-location is cost-effective. For example, long-running chat services\ngenerally follow diurnal traffic patterns, which inspire co-location of batch\njobs to fulfill resource valleys between successive peaks, and thus to saturate\nresource allocation in cluster-wide scope. These heterogeneous workloads often\nhave different business priorities, and therefore preemption can be leveraged\nfor resource elasticity. However, workloads often have distinct topology\npreferences as well. The resources released by lower-priority instances may\nfail to meet the requirements of high-priority online services which are\nusually latency-sensitive. The root cause behind such mis-match is a lack of\ntopology awareness of resource scheduler, especially during preemption. To\nbridge this gap, we develop a fine-grained topology-aware method for preemptive\nscheduling of hybrid workloads. The method ensures that the resources freed by\npreempted tasks adhere to the topological affinity needs of high-priority\npreemptors in a guaranteed or best-effort manner. This dynamic alignment\nsignificantly increases the efficiency of preemption and improves overall\nscheduled performance for LLM workloads by $55\\%$.",

Observations suggest that the magnetic fields of NSs range from\napproximately $10^{8-15}$ G. In this work, we compute the Kepler frequency and\nmoment of inertia for rotating NSs under the influence of a chaotic magnetic\nfield. We utilize an equation of state (EOS) incorporating nuclei in the crust\nand hyperons in the core, with the Hartle-Thorne formalism applied to address\nthe rotational aspects. A magnetic field ansatz is selected, in which the\nmagnetic field is coupled to the energy density. To examine the impact of a\nchaotic magnetic field on the Kepler frequency and moment of inertia, we vary\nthe magnetic field strength. Our results indicate that an increase in magnetic\nfield strength enhances the Kepler frequency of rotating NSs. For the moment of\ninertia, the effect of magnetic field variation is minimal at lower masses but\nbecomes more pronounced as the mass exceeds $M=0.5 M_\\odot$, where moment of\ninertia increases with increasing magnetic field. Furthermore, our results for\nthe moment of inertia comply with constraint derived from pulsar mass\nmeasurements, data from gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190425, and\nX-ray observations of emission from hotspots on NS surfaces measured by NICER.",

Emulsions are prepared with a given volume fraction of\nthe initially dispersed phase, $\\phi$, ranging from dilute (low values of\n$\\phi$) to jammed emulsions (high values of $\\phi$), resulting in different\nrheological responses of the emulsion, i.e., from Newtonian to non-Newtonian\nyield-stress behaviors, respectively.

We thoroughly investigated the dynamics of the emulsion in the\nchanging of $\\phi$ and Ra.

Existing\nexercise recognition approaches often rely on synthetic datasets, raw\ncoordinate inputs sensitive to user and camera variations, and fail to fully\nexploit the temporal dependencies in exercise movements. These issues limit\ntheir generalizability and robustness in real-world conditions, where lighting,\ncamera angles, and user body types vary.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a BiLSTM-based model that leverages\ninvariant features, such as joint angles, alongside raw coordinates. By using\nboth angles and (x, y, z) coordinates, the model adapts to changes in\nperspective, user positioning, and body differences, improving generalization.\nTraining on 30-frame sequences enables the BiLSTM to capture the temporal\ncontext of exercises and recognize patterns evolving over time.\n  We compiled a dataset combining synthetic data from the InfiniteRep dataset\nand real-world videos from Kaggle and other sources. This dataset includes four\ncommon exercises: squat, push-up, shoulder press, and bicep curl. The model was\ntrained and validated on these diverse datasets, achieving an accuracy of over\n99% on the test set.

Computation of\npairwise alignments between candidate haplotypes and sequencing reads using\nPair-HMMs is a key component in DNA variant calling tools such as the GATK\nHaplotypeCaller but can be highly time consuming due to its quadratic time\ncomplexity and the large number of pairs to be aligned. Unfortunately, previous\napproaches to accelerate this task using the massively parallel processing\ncapabilities of modern GPUs are limited by inefficient memory access schemes.\nThis established the need for significantly faster solutions. We address this\nneed by presenting gpuPairHMM -- a novel GPU-based parallelization scheme for\nthe dynamic-programming based Pair-HMM forward algorithm based on wavefronts\nand warp-shuffles. It gains efficiency by minimizing both memory accesses and\ninstructions. We show that our approach achieves close-to-peak performance on\nseveral generations of modern CUDA-enabled GPUs (Volta, Ampere, Ada, Hopper).\nIt also outperforms prior implementations on GPUs, CPUs, and FPGAs by a factor\nof at least 8.6, 10.4, and 14.5, respectively. gpuPairHMM is publicly available\nat https://github.com/asbschmidt/gpuPairHMM.",

While increased device\nparticipation enhances multi-view sensing data, it also imposes significant\ncommunication overhead between devices and the edge server.

However, traditional fuzz testing tools rely on manually\ncrafted fuzz drivers, which can limit both testing efficiency and\neffectiveness. To address this challenge, we propose an automated fuzz testing\nmethod driven by a code knowledge graph and powered by an LLM-based intelligent\nagent system, referred to as CKGFuzzer. We approach fuzz driver creation as a\ncode generation task, leveraging the knowledge graph of the code repository to\nautomate the generation process within the fuzzing loop, while continuously\nrefining both the fuzz driver and input seeds. The code knowledge graph is\nconstructed through interprocedural program analysis, where each node in the\ngraph represents a code entity, such as a function or a file. The knowledge\ngraph-enhanced CKGFuzzer not only effectively resolves compilation errors in\nfuzz drivers and generates input seeds tailored to specific API usage\nscenarios, but also analyzes fuzz driver crash reports, assisting developers in\nimproving code quality. By querying the knowledge graph of the code repository\nand learning from API usage scenarios, we can better identify testing targets\nand understand the specific purpose of each fuzz driver. We evaluated our\napproach using eight open-source software projects. The experimental results\nindicate that CKGFuzzer achieved an average improvement of 8.73% in code\ncoverage compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, CKGFuzzer\nreduced the manual review workload in crash case analysis by 84.4% and\nsuccessfully detected 11 real bugs (including nine previously unreported bugs)\nacross the tested libraries.",

Our method involves transforming input text into a set of KG\nembeddings and using an adapter to integrate these embeddings into the language\nmodel space, without relying on external retrieval processes.\n  To facilitate this, we created WikiEntities, a dataset containing over 3\nmillion Wikipedia texts annotated with entities from Wikidata and their\ncorresponding embeddings from PyTorch-BigGraph. This dataset serves as a\nvaluable resource for training Entity Linking models and adapting the described\nmethod to various LLMs using specialized adapters.\n  Our method does not require fine-tuning of the language models themselves;\ninstead, we only train the adapter. This ensures that the model's performance\non other tasks is not affected. We trained an adapter for the Mistral 7B, LLaMA\n2-7B (chat), and LLaMA 3-8B (instruct) models using this dataset and\ndemonstrated that our approach improves performance on the HaluEval, True-False\nbenchmarks and FEVER dataset.

To bridge this\ngap, we used a large-volume three-phase alternating-current plasma torch to\nobtain a full high-temperature condensation sequence at an elevated\ncarbon-to-oxygen ratio from a fluxed chondritic gas composition. We show that\nthe crystallized suites of carbides, silicides, nitrides, sulfides, oxides and\nsilicates and the bulk composition of the condensates are properly modelled by\na kinetically inhibited condensation scenario controlled by gas flow. This\nvalidates the thermodynamic predictions of the condensation sequence at a high\ncarbon-to-oxygen ratio. On this basis and using appropriate optical properties,\nwe also demonstrate the influence of pressure on dust chemistry as well as the\nlow probability of forming and detecting iron silicides in asymptotic giant\nbranch C-rich circumstellar environments as well as in our chondritic\nmeteorites.

    "abstract": "Backdoor attack has been considered as a serious security threat to deep\nneural networks (DNNs). Poisoned sample detection (PSD) that aims at filtering\nout poisoned samples from an untrustworthy training dataset has shown very\npromising performance for defending against data poisoning based backdoor\nattacks. However, we observe that the detection performance of many advanced\nmethods is likely to be unstable when facing weak backdoor attacks, such as low\npoisoning ratio or weak trigger strength. To further verify this observation,\nwe make a statistical investigation among various backdoor attacks and poisoned\nsample detections, showing a positive correlation between backdoor effect and\ndetection performance. It inspires us to strengthen the backdoor effect to\nenhance detection performance. Since we cannot achieve that goal via directly\nmanipulating poisoning ratio or trigger strength, we propose to train one model\nusing the Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithm, rather than the vanilla\ntraining algorithm. We also provide both empirical and theoretical analysis\nabout how SAM training strengthens the backdoor effect. Then, this SAM trained\nmodel can be seamlessly integrated with any off-the-shelf PSD method that\nextracts discriminative features from the trained model for detection, called\nSAM-enhanced PSD. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show the\nreliable detection performance of the proposed method against both weak and\nstrong backdoor attacks, with significant improvements against various attacks\n($+34.38\\%$ TPR on average), over the conventional PSD methods (i.e., without\nSAM enhancement). Overall, this work provides new insights about PSD and\nproposes a novel approach that can complement existing detection methods, which\nmay inspire more in-depth explorations in this field.",

Heat pipes are widely used in heat\ntransfer and other fields, and especially have important applications in\nnuclear engineering. One of its most important characteristics is the heat\ntransfer limit. In this work, heat transfer limits are first reviewed, and the\ndetailed calculation equations are presented. Then, a Matlab code to calculate\nheat transfer limits as well as the thermal conductance are provided. Second,\nan experimental setup for testing the heat transfer characteristics of heat\npipes was developed, which could be used to measure the thermal conductance as\nwell as the heat transfer limits. The calculated results show that, for water\nheat pipes, the capillary limit mainly affects heat transfer in low temperature\nconditions, while in high temperature conditions, boiling limit dominates. In\naddition, the experiment results show that the thermal conductance of the\nmeasured heat pipe is 7267 W/(m^2*K), which agrees with the calculation result.",

Using advanced radiative\ntransfer simulations with the new, open-source SuperLite code to generate\nsynthetic spectra, we identify key spectroscopic indicators of CSM\ncharacteristics.

This is crucial as real-world\ndistributions are often continuous and differ from the discrete scenarios\nstudied in prior works.\n  In this work, we design a conditional mutual information tester for Gaussian\nrandom variables that can test whether two Gaussian random variables are\nindependent, or their conditional mutual information is at least $\\varepsilon$,\nfor some parameter $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$ using\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ samples which we show to be near-optimal.

At the core of our method\nlies a neural Kalman filter, with an observation model conditioned on\nassociations of detections parameterized by a neural network. Given a batch of\nframes as input, data associations between detections from adjacent frames are\npredicted by a neural network followed by a Sinkhorn normalization that\ndetermines the assignment probabilities of detections to states. Kalman\nsmoothing is then used to obtain the marginal probability of observations given\nthe inferred states, producing a training objective to maximize this marginal\nprobability using gradient descent. The proposed framework is fully\ndifferentiable, allowing the underlying neural model to be trained end-to-end.\nWe evaluate our approach on the challenging MOT17, MOT20, and BDD100K datasets\nand achieve state-of-the-art results in comparison to self-supervised trackers\nusing public detections.",

The perception model extracts discrete\n(latent) states from continuous observations using a variational Gaussian\nmixture likelihood. Importantly, our model constantly monitors the collected\ndata searching for new Gaussian components, i.e., the perception model performs\na form of structure learning (Smith et al., 2020; Friston et al., 2018; Neacsu\net al., 2022) as it learns the number of Gaussian components in the mixture.\nAdditionally, the transition model learns the temporal transition between\nconsecutive time steps by taking advantage of the Dirichlet-categorical\nconjugacy. Both the perception and transition models are able to forget part of\nthe data points, while integrating the information they provide within the\nprior, which ensure fast variational inference. Finally, decision making is\nperformed with a variant of Q-learning which is able to learn Q-values from\nbeliefs over states. Empirically, we have demonstrated the model's ability to\nlearn the structure of several mazes: the model discovered the number of states\nand the transition probabilities between these states.

    "abstract": "More than 60 broad-lined type Ic (Ic-BL) supernovae (SNe) are associated with\na long gamma-ray burst (GRB). However, many type Ic-BL SNe exhibit no sign of\nan associated GRB. On average, the expansion velocities of GRB-associated type\nIc-BL SNe (GRB-SNe) are greater than those of type Ic-BL SNe without an\nassociated GRB. This work presents the largest spectroscopic sample of type\nIc-BL SNe with and without GRBs to date, consisting of 61 ordinary type Ic-BL\nSNe and 13 GRB-SNe. The goal of this work is to compare the evolution of SN\nexpansion velocities in cases where an ultra-relativistic jet has been launched\n(GRB-SNe) and cases where no GRB jet is inferred from observations (ordinary\ntype Ic-BL SNe), to search for possible jet influences. To do this we measured\nthe expansion velocities of the Fe II and Si II features observed in the\nspectra of type Ic-BL SNe using a spline fitting method and fitted the velocity\nevolution with single and broken power-laws. In each analysis we compared two\npopulations: ordinary type Ic-BL SNe and GRB-SNe. We find that the expansion\nvelocities of the Fe II and Si II features are similar between these\npopulations, in contrast with previous studies. The Fe II and Si II power-law\nindices indicate that GRB-SNe decline at similar rates to ordinary type Ic-BL\nsupernovae. Broken power-law evolution appears to be more common for the Si II\nfeature. This observation may hint at a two-component ejecta model, such as a\nGRB jet or a cocoon. Neither the velocities nor their evolution can be used to\ndistinguish between ordinary type Ic-BL SNe and GRB-SNe. Velocities consistent\nwith broken power-law evolution may indicate the presence of a GRB jet in some\nof these ordinary type Ic-BL SNe, but this is likely not as robust as late-time\nradio surveys. These results suggest that GRB-SNe and ordinary type Ic-BL SNe\nare drawn from the same underlying population of events.",

    "abstract": "E-commerce app users exhibit behaviors that are inherently logically\nconsistent. A series of multi-scenario user behaviors interconnect to form the\nscene-level all-domain user moveline, which ultimately reveals the user's true\nintention. Traditional CTR prediction methods typically focus on the item-level\ninteraction between the target item and the historically interacted items.\nHowever, the scene-level interaction between the target item and the user\nmoveline remains underexplored. There are two challenges when modeling the\ninteraction with preceding all-domain user moveline: (i) Heterogeneity between\nitems and scenes: Unlike traditional user behavior sequences that utilize items\nas carriers, the user moveline utilizes scenes as carriers. The heterogeneity\nbetween items and scenes complicates the process of aligning interactions\nwithin a unified representation space. (ii) Temporal misalignment of linked\nscene-level and item-level behaviors: In the preceding user moveline with a\nfixed sampling length, certain critical scene-level behaviors are closely\nlinked to subsequent item-level behaviors. However, it is impossible to\nestablish a complete temporal alignment that clearly identifies which specific\nscene-level behaviors correspond to which item-level behaviors. To address\nthese challenges and pioneer modeling user intent from the perspective of the\nall-domain moveline, we propose All-domain Moveline Evolution Network (AMEN).\nAMEN not only transfers interactions between items and scenes to homogeneous\nrepresentation spaces, but also introduces a Temporal Sequential Pairwise (TSP)\nmechanism to understand the nuanced associations between scene-level and\nitem-level behaviors, ensuring that the all-domain user moveline differentially\ninfluences CTR predictions for user's favored and unfavored items.

We go on to develop an agent-based model for\ngenerating collective attention events to test the factors affecting emergence\nof these phenomena.

With clustered cell-free\nnetworking, the wireless network is decomposed into a number of disjoint\nparallel operating subnetworks with joint processing adopted inside each\nsubnetwork independently for intra-subnetwork interference mitigation.\nDifferent from the existing works that aim to maximize the number of\nsubnetworks without considering the limited processing capability of\nbase-stations (BSs), this paper investigates the clustered cell-free networking\nproblem with the objective of maximizing the sum ergodic capacity while\nimposing a limit on the number of user equipments (UEs) in each subnetwork to\nconstrain the joint processing complexity. By successfully transforming the\ncombinatorial NP-hard clustered cell-free networking problem into an integer\nconvex programming problem, the problem is solved by the branch-and-bound\nmethod. To further reduce the computational complexity, a bisection clustered\ncell-free networking (BC^2F-Net) algorithm is proposed to decompose the network\nhierarchically. Simulation results show that compared to the branch-and-bound\nbased scheme, the proposed BC^2F-Net algorithm significantly reduces the\ncomputational complexity yet achieves nearly the same network decomposition\nresult.

    "abstract": "The rest wavelengths of DIBs are of fundamental importance owing to the lack\nof unambiguous identification for these mysterious features. Usually the\nwavelengths of DIBs are estimated using known interstellar lines serving to\nshift the spectrum to the rest wavelengths velocity scale. However, the latter\nmay not share in fact the same parts of a cloud which carriers of DIBs occupy.\nHere we argue that the narrowest known DIB 6196 A is the best reference\nfeature. Also, we offer the geometrical center of gravity (the effective\nwavelength) of diffuse bands as a rest wavelength measurer for these generally\nasymmetric features. The exception is DIB 6196: its symmetrical (bottom) part\nmust be used as a reference for the interstellar wavelength scale, and its\ncenter of gravity serves to study the variability of the feature visible at the\nupper part of its profile. We assessed the magnitude of variation of the center\nof gravity of DIBs at 5780, 5797, 6284 and 7224 A measured in 41 objects in the\nrange of E{B-V} between 0.13 and 1.06 mag. with the lack of Doppler-split in\nprofiles of interstellar atomic/molecular lines. To estimate the width of\ndiffuse bands we offer to apply a parameter \"effective width\" W_eff which is\nthe relation of the equivalent width to the depth of the feature. In contrast\nto habitual FWHM, W_eff is not sensitive to the profile shape irregularities.\nW_eff provides lower uncertainties of the measurements than the FWHM does. The\ngradual increase of W_eff, accompanied with the red-shift of the center of\ngravity of the profile, may suggest populating of higher transitions of\nP-branch of the bands of molecules, assuming the latter are DIB carriers. It is\nalso shown, that diffuse bands are broader although more shallow in the harsh\nconditions of sigma-clouds. The difference of the effective width of DIBs in\nzeta and sigma clouds is discussed as well.",

    "abstract": "Existing state estimation algorithms for legged robots that rely on\nproprioceptive sensors often overlook foot slippage and leg deformation in the\nphysical world, leading to large estimation errors. To address this limitation,\nwe propose a comprehensive measurement model that accounts for both foot\nslippage and variable leg length by analyzing the relative motion between foot\ncontact points and the robot's body center. We show that leg length is an\nobservable quantity, meaning that its value can be explicitly inferred by\ndesigning an auxiliary filter. To this end, we introduce a dual estimation\nframework that iteratively employs a parameter filter to estimate the leg\nlength parameters and a state filter to estimate the robot's state. To prevent\nerror accumulation in this iterative framework, we construct a partial\nmeasurement model for the parameter filter using the leg static equation. This\napproach ensures that leg length estimation relies solely on joint torques and\nfoot contact forces, avoiding the influence of state estimation errors on the\nparameter estimation. Unlike leg length which can be directly estimated, foot\nslippage cannot be measured directly with the current sensor configuration.\nHowever, since foot slippage occurs at a low frequency, it can be treated as\noutliers in the measurement data. To mitigate the impact of these outliers, we\npropose the beta Kalman filter (beta KF), which redefines the estimation loss\nin canonical Kalman filtering using beta divergence. This divergence can assign\nlow weights to outliers in an adaptive manner, thereby enhancing the robustness\nof the estimation algorithm. These techniques together form the dual\nbeta-Kalman filter (Dual beta KF), a novel algorithm for robust state\nestimation in legged robots. Experimental results on the Unitree GO2 robot\ndemonstrate that the Dual beta KF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

In this work, we propose a systematic\ninvestigation into AIGC watermarking and provide the first formal definition of\nAIGC watermarking. Different from previous surveys, we provide a taxonomy based\non the core properties of the watermark which are summarized through\ncomprehensive literature from various AIGC modalities. Derived from the\nproperties, we discuss the functionality and security threats of AIGC\nwatermarking. In the end, we thoroughly investigate the AIGC governance of\ndifferent countries and practitioners. We believe this taxonomy better aligns\nwith the practical demands for watermarking in the era of GenAI, thus providing\na clearer summary of existing work and uncovering potential future research\ndirections for the community.",

    "abstract": "Detecting small objects in complex scenes, such as those captured by drones,\nis a daunting challenge due to the difficulty in capturing the complex features\nof small targets. While the YOLO family has achieved great success in large\ntarget detection, its performance is less than satisfactory when faced with\nsmall targets. Because of this, this paper proposes a revolutionary model\nSL-YOLO (Stronger and Lighter YOLO) that aims to break the bottleneck of small\ntarget detection. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network\n(HEPAN), a pioneering cross-scale feature fusion method that can ensure\nunparalleled detection accuracy even in the most challenging environments. At\nthe same time, without sacrificing detection capabilities, we design the C2fDCB\nlightweight module and add the SCDown downsampling module to greatly reduce the\nmodel's parameters and computational complexity. Our experimental results on\nthe VisDrone2019 dataset reveal a significant improvement in performance, with\nmAP@0.5 jumping from 43.0% to 46.9% and mAP@0.5:0.95 increasing from 26.0% to\n28.9%. At the same time, the model parameters are reduced from 11.1M to 9.6M,\nand the FPS can reach 132, making it an ideal solution for real-time small\nobject detection in resource-constrained environments.",

    "abstract": "High-impact and potentially dangerous capabilities can and should be broken\ndown into early warning shots long before reaching red lines. Each of these\nearly warning shots should correspond to a precursory capability. Each\nprecursory capability sits on a spectrum indicating its proximity to a final\nhigh-impact capability, corresponding to a red line. To meaningfully detect and\ntrack capability progress, we propose a taxonomy of dangerous capability zones\n(a zoning taxonomy) tied to a staggered information exchange framework that\nenables relevant bodies to take action accordingly. In the Frontier AI Safety\nCommitments, signatories commit to sharing more detailed information with\ntrusted actors, including an appointed body, as appropriate (Commitment VII).\nBuilding on our zoning taxonomy, this paper makes four recommendations for\nspecifying information sharing as detailed in Commitment VII. (1) Precursory\ncapabilities should be shared as soon as they become known through internal\nevaluations before deployment. (2) AI Safety Institutes (AISIs) should be the\ntrusted actors appointed to receive and coordinate information on precursory\ncomponents. (3) AISIs should establish adequate information protection\ninfrastructure and guarantee increased information security as precursory\ncapabilities move through the zones and towards red lines, including, if\nnecessary, by classifying the information on precursory capabilities or marking\nit as controlled. (4) High-impact capability progress in one geographical\nregion may translate to risk in other regions and necessitates more\ncomprehensive risk assessment internationally. As such, AISIs should exchange\ninformation on precursory capabilities with other AISIs, relying on the\nexisting frameworks on international classified exchanges and applying lessons\nlearned from other regulated high-risk sectors.",

Reducing the Onsager matrix to a few key two-particle scattering\nprocesses enables us to efficiently examine transport in both low- and\nhigh-temperature limits.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing large-scale latent networks from observed dynamics is crucial\nfor understanding complex systems. However, the existing methods based on\ncompressive sensing are often rendered infeasible in practice by prohibitive\ncomputational and memory costs. To address this challenge, we introduce a new\ndistributed computing framework for efficient large-scale network\nreconstruction with parallel computing, namely PALMS (Parallel Adaptive Lasso\nwith Multi-directional Signals). The core idea of PALMS is to decompose the\ncomplex global problem by partitioning network nodes, enabling the parallel\nestimation of sub-networks across multiple computing units. This strategy\nsubstantially reduces the computational complexity and storage requirements of\nclassic methods. By using the adaptive multi-directional regularization on each\ncomputing unit, we also establish the consistency of PALMS estimator\ntheoretically. Extensive simulation studies and empirical analyses on several\nlarge-scale real-world networks validate the computational efficiency and\nrobust reconstruction accuracy of our approach.",

Although fuzzing has shown some effectiveness in identifying\nvulnerabilities in IoT HTTP services, most state-of-the-art tools still rely on\nrandom mutation trategies, leading to difficulties in accurately understanding\nthe HTTP protocol's structure and generating many invalid test cases.\nFurthermore, These fuzzers rely on a limited set of initial seeds for testing.\nWhile this approach initiates testing, the limited number and diversity of\nseeds hinder comprehensive coverage of complex scenarios in IoT HTTP services.\nIn this paper, we investigate and find that large language models (LLMs) excel\nin parsing HTTP protocol data and analyzing code logic. Based on these\nfindings, we propose a novel LLM-guided IoT HTTP fuzzing method, ChatHTTPFuzz,\nwhich automatically parses protocol fields and analyzes service code logic to\ngenerate protocol-compliant test cases. Specifically, we use LLMs to label\nfields in HTTP protocol data, creating seed templates. Second, The LLM analyzes\nservice code to guide the generation of additional packets aligned with the\ncode logic, enriching the seed templates and their field values.

    "abstract": "Migration is a key ingredient for the formation of close-in super-Earth and\nmini-Neptune systems, as it sets in which resonances planets can be trapped.\nSlower migration rates result in wider resonance configurations compared to\nhigher migration rates. We investigate the influence of different migration\nrates, set by the disc's viscosity, on the structure of multi-planet systems\ngrowing by pebble accretion via N-body simulations. Planets in low viscosity\nenvironments migrate slower due to partial gap opening. Thus systems formed in\nlow viscosity environments tend to have planets trapped in wider resonant\nconfigurations (typically 4:3, 3:2 and 2:1), compared to their high viscosity\ncounterparts (mostly 7:6, 5:4 and 4:3 resonances). After gas disc dissipation,\nthe damping forces cease and the systems can undergo instabilities, rearranging\ntheir configurations and breaking the resonance chains. The low viscosity discs\nnaturally account for the resonant chains like Trappist-1, TOI-178 and\nKepler-223, unlike high viscosity simulations which produce relatively more\ncompact chains. About 95% of our low viscosity resonant chains became unstable,\nexperiencing giant impacts. Dynamical instabilities in our low viscosity\nsimulations are more violent than those of high viscosity simulations due to\nthe effects of leftover external perturbers (P>200 days). About 50% of our\nfinal system ended with no planets within 200 days, while all our systems have\nremaining outer planets. We speculate that this process could be qualitatively\nconsistent with the lack of inner planets in a large fraction of Sun-like\nstars. Systems produced in low viscosity simulations alone do not match the\noverall period ratio distribution of observations, but give a better match to\nthe period distributions of chains, which may suggest that systems of\nsuper-Earths and mini-Neptunes form in natal discs with a diversity of\nviscosities.",

    "abstract": "Deploying AI systems in public institutions can have far-reaching\nconsequences for many people, making it a matter of public interest. Providing\nopportunities for stakeholders to come together, understand these systems, and\ndebate their merits and harms is thus essential. Explainable AI often focuses\non individuals, but deliberation benefits from group settings, which are\nunderexplored. To address this gap, we present findings from an interview study\nwith 8 focus groups and 12 individuals. Our findings provide insight into how\nexplanations support AI novices in deliberating alone and in groups.\nParticipants used modular explanations with four information categories to\nsolve tasks and decide about an AI system's deployment. We found that the\nexplanations supported groups in creating shared understanding and in finding\narguments for and against the system's deployment. In comparison, individual\nparticipants engaged with explanations in more depth and performed better in\nthe study tasks, but missed an exchange with others. Based on our findings, we\nprovide suggestions on how explanations should be designed to work in group\nsettings and describe their potential use in real-world contexts. With this,\nour contributions inform XAI research that aims to enable AI novices to\nunderstand and deliberate AI systems in the public sector.",

However, rapid urbanization in recent years has led to\ndynamic shifts in traffic patterns and travel demand, posing major challenges\nfor accurate long-term traffic prediction. The generalization capability of\nST-GNNs in extended temporal scenarios and cross-city applications remains\nlargely unexplored. In this study, we evaluate state-of-the-art models on an\nextended traffic benchmark and observe substantial performance degradation in\nexisting ST-GNNs over time, which we attribute to their limited inductive\ncapabilities. Our analysis reveals that this degradation stems from an\ninability to adapt to evolving spatial relationships within urban environments.\nTo address this limitation, we reconsider the design of adaptive embeddings and\npropose a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) embedding approach that enables\nmodels to adapt to new scenarios without retraining. We incorporate PCA\nembeddings into existing ST-GNN and Transformer architectures, achieving marked\nimprovements in performance. Notably, PCA embeddings allow for flexibility in\ngraph structures between training and testing, enabling models trained on one\ncity to perform zero-shot predictions on other cities. This adaptability\ndemonstrates the potential of PCA embeddings in enhancing the robustness and\ngeneralization of spatiotemporal models.",

The formation of an asymmetric vortex in a healthy\nLV shows an efficient way of blood transport. The vortex pattern changes before\nany change in the geometry of LV is noticeable.

The measurement is provided in two Galactic regions and appears\nto be 2-3 times higher than the gamma-ray signal expected from the hadronic\ninteractions of diffuse cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, potentially\nimplying that either additional emission sources exist or cosmic ray\nintensities have spatial variations. In this work, we calculate the hadronic\ngamma-ray diffuse emission outside the masks, considering a realistic gas\ndistribution. We present a comprehensive calculation of the emission, which\nincludes systematic uncertainties in the gas content of the Galactic disk, in\nthe energy and spatial distribution of cosmic rays, as well as in the hadronic\ninteraction cross-sections. Our results show that these factors mitigate the\ntension between data and predictions. The LHAASO data appear compatible with\nour baseline model in the outer Galactic region. In the inner region, the data\nshow an excess with respect to the predictions below $\\sim 50$ TeV, while at\nhigher energies they are well described by our model.

    "abstract": "As AI-generated images become widespread, reliable watermarking is essential\nfor content verification, copyright enforcement, and combating disinformation.\nExisting techniques rely on heuristic approaches and lack formal guarantees of\nundetectability, making them vulnerable to steganographic attacks that can\nexpose or erase the watermark. Additionally, these techniques often degrade\noutput quality by introducing perceptible changes, which is not only\nundesirable but an important barrier to adoption in practice.\n  In this work, we introduce CLUE-Mark, the first provably undetectable\nwatermarking scheme for diffusion models. CLUE-Mark requires no changes to the\nmodel being watermarked, is computationally efficient, and because it is\nprovably undetectable is guaranteed to have no impact on model output quality.\nOur approach leverages the Continuous Learning With Errors (CLWE) problem -- a\ncryptographically hard lattice problem -- to embed watermarks in the latent\nnoise vectors used by diffusion models. By proving undetectability via\nreduction from a cryptographically hard problem we ensure not only that the\nwatermark is imperceptible to human observers or adhoc heuristics, but to\n\\emph{any} efficient detector that does not have the secret key. CLUE-Mark\nallows multiple keys to be embedded, enabling traceability of images to\nspecific users without altering model parameters. Empirical evaluations on\nstate-of-the-art diffusion models confirm that CLUE-Mark achieves high\nrecoverability, preserves image quality, and is robust to minor perturbations\nsuch JPEG compression and brightness adjustments. Uniquely, CLUE-Mark cannot be\ndetected nor removed by recent steganographic attacks.",

In the appendix, we\ndiscuss in particular recent examples of reducible Severi varieties and of\ncomponents of Severi varieties parameterizing non-nodal curves in positive\ncharacteristic.

Specifically, confidential containers integrate the container\nand the enclave, aiming to inherit the design-wise advantages of both (i.e.,\nresource management and data protection). However, current confidential\ncontainers suffer from large performance overheads caused by i) a larger\nstartup latency due to the enclave creation, and ii) a larger memory footprint\ndue to the non-shareable characteristics of enclave memory. This paper explores\na design conundrum of confidential container, examining why the confidential\ncontainers impose such large performance overheads. Surprisingly, we found\nthere is a universal misconception that an enclave can only be used by a single\n(containerized) process that created it. However, an enclave can be shared\nacross multiple processes, because an enclave is merely a set of physical\nresources while the process is an abstraction constructed by the host kernel.\nTo this end, we introduce TeeMate, a new approach to utilize the enclaves on\nthe host system. Especially, TeeMate designs the primitives to i) share the\nenclave memory between processes, thus preserving memory abstraction, and ii)\nassign the threads in enclave between processes, thus preserving thread\nabstraction. We concretized TeeMate on Intel SGX, and implemented confidential\nserverless computing and confidential database on top of TeeMate based\nconfidential containers.

The therapeutic module offers eye-catching gamified\ninterfaces in which each correctly spoken letter earns a higher avatar level,\nproviding positive reinforcement for the child's pronunciation improvement. Two\ndatasets were used for experimental evaluation: one from a childcare centre and\nthe other including Arabic alphabet pronunciation recordings. Our work uses a\nnovel technique for speech recognition using Melspectrogram and MFCC images.\nThe results show that the ResNet18 classifier on speech-to-image converted data\neffectively identifies mispronunciations in Arabic speech with an accuracy of\n99.015\\% with Mel-Spectrogram images outperforming ResNet18 with MFCC images.",

Commonly, ferroic phases emerge\nfrom descending symmetry-breaking, as the laws of thermodynamics dictate that\nthe ordered low entropy phases form at low temperature, which limits practical\napplications of many materials at room temperature. Rare examples of ascending\nsymmetry-breakings have been observed, but the driving force remains often\nunclear. Here, we report on a ferroelastic symmetry-breaking occurring at high\ntemperature in a spin-crossover material, studied by magnetic, DSC and X-ray\ndiffraction measurements. Our DFT calculations and our model, based on the\nLandau theory of phase transitions, explain how the cooperative thermal\nswitching of molecular spin state drives a ferroelastic symmetry breaking at\nhigh temperature, through a coupled Jahn-Teller distortion. Ferroelastic\nmaterials have rich properties, with important applications in memory,\nmultifunctional and novel controllable devices. The electronic bistability in\nsoft functional materials represents an important source of entropy gain,\ncapable of overcoming the cost of symmetry-breaking entropy, which opens up new\nperspectives for stabilizing high-temperature and low-symmetry ferroic\nfunctions of advanced materials",

A major concern is ensuring that LLM-generated content aligns\nwith human values. Existing jailbreak techniques reveal how this alignment can\nbe compromised through specific prompts or adversarial suffixes. In this study,\nwe introduce a new threat: LLMs' bias toward authority. While this inherent\nbias can improve the quality of outputs generated by LLMs, it also introduces a\npotential vulnerability, increasing the risk of producing harmful content.\nNotably, the biases in LLMs is the varying levels of trust given to different\ntypes of authoritative information in harmful queries.

To better reveal the risks with LLM, we\npropose DarkCite, an adaptive authority citation matcher and generator designed\nfor a black-box setting.

To date, the majority of algorithms for handling such densities are\nbased on proximal Langevin dynamics where one replaces the non-smooth part by a\nsmooth approximation known as the Moreau envelope. In this work, we introduce a\nnovel approach for sampling densities with $\\ell_1$-priors based on a Hadamard\nproduct parameterization. This builds upon the idea that the Laplace prior has\na Gaussian mixture representation and our method can be seen as a form of\noverparametrization: by increasing the number of variables, we construct a\ndensity from which one can directly recover the original density. This is\nfundamentally different from proximal-type approaches since our resolution is\nexact, while proximal-based methods introduce additional bias due to the\nMoreau-envelope smoothing. For our new density, we present its Langevin\ndynamics in continuous time and establish well-posedness and geometric\nergodicity. We also present a discretization scheme for the continuous dynamics\nand prove convergence as the time-step diminishes.",

Early support\nconsisted in recommending the most suited reviewer for a given change or in\nprioritizing the review tasks. With the advent of deep learning in software\nengineering, the level of automation has been pushed to new heights, with\napproaches able to provide feedback on source code in natural language as a\nhuman reviewer would do. Also, recent work documented open source projects\nadopting Large Language Models (LLMs) as co-reviewers. Although the research in\nthis field is very active, little is known about the actual impact of including\nautomatically generated code reviews in the code review process. While there\nare many aspects worth investigating, in this work we focus on three of them:\n(i) review quality, i.e., the reviewer's ability to identify issues in the\ncode; (ii) review cost, i.e., the time spent reviewing the code; and (iii)\nreviewer's confidence, i.e., how confident is the reviewer about the provided\nfeedback. We run a controlled experiment with 29 experts who reviewed different\nprograms with/without the support of an automatically generated code review.\nDuring the experiment we monitored the reviewers' activities, for over 50 hours\nof recorded code reviews. We show that reviewers consider valid most of the\nissues automatically identified by the LLM and that the availability of an\nautomated review as a starting point strongly influences their behavior:\nReviewers tend to focus on the code locations indicated by the LLM rather than\nsearching for additional issues in other parts of the code. The reviewers who\nstarted from an automated review identified a higher number of low-severity\nissues while, however, not identifying more high-severity issues as compared to\na completely manual process. Finally, the automated support did not result in\nsaved time and did not increase the reviewers' confidence.",

This constraint leads to a strict hierarchy of correlation\nsets in such scenarios, namely, classical, quantum, and nonsignaling. However,\nwithout any constraints on communication between the parties, they can realize\narbitrary correlations by exchanging only classical systems. Here we consider a\nmultipartite scenario where the parties can engage in at most a single round of\ncommunication, i.e., each party is allowed to receive a system once, implement\nany local intervention on it, and send out the resulting system once. While no\nglobal assumption about causal relations between parties is assumed in this\nscenario, we do make a causal assumption local to each party, i.e., the input\nreceived by it causally precedes the output it sends out. We then introduce\nantinomicity, a notion of nonclassicality for correlations in such scenarios,\nand prove the existence of a strict hierarchy of correlation sets classified by\ntheir antinomicity. Antinomicity serves as a generalization of Bell\nnonlocality: when all the parties discard their output systems (i.e., in a\nnonsignaling scenario), it is mathematically equivalent to Bell nonlocality.\nLike Bell nonlocality, it can be understood as an instance of fine-tuning, one\nthat is necessary in any classical model of cyclic causation that avoids\ntime-travel antinomies but allows antinomic correlations. Furthermore,\nantinomicity resolves a long-standing puzzle, i.e., the failure of causal\ninequality violations as device-independent witnesses of nonclassicality.\nAntinomicity implies causal inequality violations, but not conversely.",

One of GNNs' main drawbacks is their\nlack of interpretability, which limits their application in sensitive fields.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new methodology involving graph communities to\naddress the interpretability of graph classification problems. The proposed\nmethod, called GECo, exploits the idea that if a community is a subset of graph\nnodes densely connected, this property should play a role in graph\nclassification. This is reasonable, especially if we consider the\nmessage-passing mechanism, which is the basic mechanism of GNNs. GECo analyzes\nthe contribution to the classification result of the communities in the graph,\nbuilding a mask that highlights graph-relevant structures. GECo is tested for\nGraph Convolutional Networks on six artificial and four real-world graph\ndatasets and is compared to the main explainability methods such as\nPGMExplainer, PGExplainer, GNNExplainer, and SubgraphX using four different\nmetrics. The obtained results outperform the other methods for artificial graph\ndatasets and most real-world datasets.",

We examine the relationship between the built\nenvironment and school-run traffic congestion, using Beijing, China, as a case\nstudy. First, we use multi-source geospatial data to assess the built\nenvironment characteristics around schools across five dimensions: spatial\nconcentration, transportation infrastructure, street topology, spatial\nrichness, and scenescapes. Second, employing a generalized ordered logit model,\nwe analyze how traffic congestion around schools varies during peak hours on\nschool days, regular non-school days, and national college entrance exam days.\nLastly, we identify the built environment factors contributing to school-run\ntraffic congestion through multivariable linear regression and Shapley value\nexplanations. Our findings reveal that: (1) School runs significantly\nexacerbate traffic congestion around schools, reducing the likelihood of\nfree-flow by 8.34\\% during school run times; (2) School-run traffic congestion\nis more severe in areas with multiple schools, bus stops, and scenescapes\nrelated to business and financial functions.

While Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), in particular, deep learning, has become a key component in\ndefending against phishing attacks, these approaches face critical limitations.\nThe scarcity of publicly available, diverse, and updated data, largely due to\nprivacy concerns, constrains detection effectiveness. As phishing tactics\nevolve rapidly, models trained on limited, outdated data struggle to detect\nnew, sophisticated deception strategies, leaving systems and people vulnerable\nto an ever-growing array of attacks. We propose the first Phishing Evolution\nFramEworK (PEEK) for augmenting phishing email datasets with respect to quality\nand diversity, and analyzing changing phishing patterns for detection to adapt\nto updated phishing attacks. Specifically, we integrate large language models\n(LLMs) into the process of adversarial training to enhance the performance of\nthe generated dataset and leverage persuasion principles in a recurrent\nframework to facilitate the understanding of changing phishing strategies. PEEK\nraises the proportion of usable phishing samples from 21.4% to 84.8%,\nsurpassing existing works that rely on prompting and fine-tuning LLMs. The\nphishing datasets provided by PEEK, with evolving phishing patterns, outperform\nthe other two available LLM-generated phishing email datasets in improving\ndetection robustness.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in medical image analysis have predominantly relied on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), achieving impressive performance in chest\nX-ray classification tasks, such as the 92% AUC reported by AutoThorax-Net and\nthe 88% AUC achieved by ChexNet in classifcation tasks. However, in the medical\nfield, even small improvements in accuracy can have significant clinical\nimplications. This study explores the application of Vision Transformers (ViT),\na state-of-the-art architecture in machine learning, to chest X-ray analysis,\naiming to push the boundaries of diagnostic accuracy. I present a comparative\nanalysis of two ViT-based approaches: one utilizing full chest X-ray images and\nanother focusing on segmented lung regions. Experiments demonstrate that both\nmethods surpass the performance of traditional CNN-based models, with the\nfull-image ViT achieving up to 97.83% accuracy and the lung-segmented ViT\nreaching 96.58% accuracy in classifcation of diseases on three label and AUC of\n94.54% when label numbers are increased to eight. Notably, the full-image\napproach showed superior performance across all metrics, including precision,\nrecall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC. These findings suggest that Vision Transformers\ncan effectively capture relevant features from chest X-rays without the need\nfor explicit lung segmentation, potentially simplifying the preprocessing\npipeline while maintaining high accuracy. This research contributes to the\ngrowing body of evidence supporting the efficacy of transformer-based\narchitectures in medical image analysis and highlights their potential to\nenhance diagnostic precision in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "In NeRF, a critical problem is to effectively estimate the occupancy to guide\nempty-space skipping and point sampling. Grid-based methods work well for\nsmall-scale scenes. However, on large-scale scenes, they are limited by\npredefined bounding boxes, grid resolutions, and high memory usage for grid\nupdates, and thus struggle to speed up training for large-scale, irregularly\nbounded and complex urban scenes without sacrificing accuracy. In this paper,\nwe propose to learn a continuous and compact large-scale occupancy network,\nwhich can classify 3D points as occupied or unoccupied points. We train this\noccupancy network end-to-end together with the radiance field in a\nself-supervised manner by three designs. First, we propose a novel imbalanced\noccupancy loss to regularize the occupancy network. It makes the occupancy\nnetwork effectively control the ratio of unoccupied and occupied points,\nmotivated by the prior that most of 3D scene points are unoccupied. Second, we\ndesign an imbalanced architecture containing a large scene network and a small\nempty space network to separately encode occupied and unoccupied points\nclassified by the occupancy network. This imbalanced structure can effectively\nmodel the imbalanced nature of occupied and unoccupied regions. Third, we\ndesign an explicit density loss to guide the occupancy network, making the\ndensity of unoccupied points smaller. As far as we know, we are the first to\nlearn a continuous and compact occupancy of large-scale NeRF by a network. In\nour experiments, our occupancy network can quickly learn more compact, accurate\nand smooth occupancy compared to the occupancy grid. With our learned occupancy\nas guidance for empty space skipping on challenging large-scale benchmarks, our\nmethod consistently obtains higher accuracy compared to the occupancy grid, and\nour method can speed up state-of-the-art NeRF methods without sacrificing\naccuracy.",

We studied the correlation between the jet\npower and the accretion rate, as well as the comparison between jet power\nestimated by spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and that estimated by\ntheoretical formula and radio flux density. Our results suggest that there is\nno correlation between jet power estimated by SED fitting and the accretion\nrate for BL Lacs, while a positive and weak correlation exists for flat\nspectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Meanwhile, to confirm whether the BP and BZ\nmechanism is sufficient to launch the jet for FSRQs and BL Lacs, we compare the\ntheoretical jet power with that estimated by SED fitting, as well as that by\nradio emission. We found that the jet power for most of the two subclasses\nestimated by SED fitting cannot be explained by either the BP or BZ mechanism.\nWhile the jet power for most FSRQs estimated by radio flux density can be\nexplained by the BP mechanism, and most BL Lacs can be explained by the BZ\nmechanism. We also found that FSRQs have higher accretion rates than BL Lacs,\nimplying different accretion disks around their central black holes: FSRQs\ntypically have standard disks, while BL Lacs usually have advection-dominated\naccretion flow disks.",

In this article, we propose a\nnovel method for detecting defects in UAV patrol images, which is based on\nvision-language pretraining for transmission line (VLP-TL) and a progressive\ntransfer strategy (PTS). Specifically, VLP-TL contains two novel pretraining\ntasks tailored for the transmission line scenario, aimimg at pretraining an\nimage encoder with abundant knowledge acquired from both visual and linguistic\ninformation. Transferring the pretrained image encoder to the defect detector\nas its backbone can effectively alleviate the insufficient visual information\nproblem. In addition, the PTS further improves transfer performance by\nprogressively bridging the gap between pretraining and downstream defection\ndetection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method\nsignificantly improves defect detection accuracy by jointly utilizing\nmultimodal information, overcoming the limitations of insufficient\ndefect-related visual information provided by UAV patrol images.",

However, the\nquestion of the optimal initiation time for a single quarantine remains\nunanswered. Here, we use the SIR model in order to determine the optimal\nquarantine initiation time, by computing the optimal susceptible fraction at\nthe onset of the quarantine, which minimizes the total outbreak size.

    "abstract": "This paper shows that the autoregressive model is an effective and scalable\nmonocular depth estimator. Our idea is simple: We tackle the monocular depth\nestimation (MDE) task with an autoregressive prediction paradigm, based on two\ncore designs. First, our depth autoregressive model (DAR) treats the depth map\nof different resolutions as a set of tokens, and conducts the low-to-high\nresolution autoregressive objective with a patch-wise casual mask. Second, our\nDAR recursively discretizes the entire depth range into more compact intervals,\nand attains the coarse-to-fine granularity autoregressive objective in an\nordinal-regression manner. By coupling these two autoregressive objectives, our\nDAR establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on KITTI and NYU Depth v2 by clear\nmargins. Further, our scalable approach allows us to scale the model up to 2.0B\nand achieve the best RMSE of 1.799 on the KITTI dataset (5% improvement)\ncompared to 1.896 by the current SOTA (Depth Anything). DAR further showcases\nzero-shot generalization ability on unseen datasets. These results suggest that\nDAR yields superior performance with an autoregressive prediction paradigm,\nproviding a promising approach to equip modern autoregressive large models\n(e.g., GPT-4o) with depth estimation capabilities.",

Many current methods attempt to leverage\nthe long-sequence understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) for this task. However, without comprehensive data\nsupport, these approaches often alter the essential feature transmission\npathways of MLLMs, disrupting the intrinsic knowledge within the models and\nlimiting their potential in RSICC. In this paper, we propose a novel model,\nCCExpert, based on a new, advanced multimodal large model framework. Firstly,\nwe design a difference-aware integration module to capture multi-scale\ndifferences between bi-temporal images and incorporate them into the original\nimage context, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of differential\nfeatures. Secondly, we constructed a high-quality, diversified dataset called\nCC-Foundation, containing 200,000 image pairs and 1.2 million captions, to\nprovide substantial data support for continue pretraining in this domain.\nLastly, we employed a three-stage progressive training process to ensure the\ndeep integration of the difference-aware integration module with the pretrained\nMLLM.

To transfer knowledge from seen to unseen classes,\nmost ZSL methods often learn a shared embedding space by simply aligning visual\nembeddings with semantic prototypes. However, methods trained under this\nparadigm often struggle to learn robust embedding space because they align the\ntwo modalities in an isolated manner among classes, which ignore the crucial\nclass relationship during the alignment process. To address the aforementioned\nchallenges, this paper proposes a Visual-Semantic Graph Matching Net, termed as\nVSGMN, which leverages semantic relationships among classes to aid in\nvisual-semantic embedding. VSGMN employs a Graph Build Network (GBN) and a\nGraph Matching Network (GMN) to achieve two-stage visual-semantic alignment.\nSpecifically, GBN first utilizes an embedding-based approach to build visual\nand semantic graphs in the semantic space and align the embedding with its\nprototype for first-stage alignment. Additionally, to supplement unseen class\nrelations in these graphs, GBN also build the unseen class nodes based on\nsemantic relationships. In the second stage, GMN continuously integrates\nneighbor and cross-graph information into the constructed graph nodes, and\naligns the node relationships between the two graphs under the class\nrelationship constraint. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that VSGMN achieves superior performance in both conventional and\ngeneralized ZSL scenarios.

    "abstract": "Accurate urban microclimate analysis with wind velocity and temperature is\nvital for energy-efficient urban planning, supporting carbon reduction,\nenhancing public health and comfort, and advancing the low-altitude economy.\nHowever, traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations that couple\nvelocity and temperature are computationally expensive. Recent machine learning\nadvancements offer promising alternatives for accelerating urban microclimate\nsimulations. The Fourier neural operator (FNO) has shown efficiency and\naccuracy in predicting single-variable velocity magnitudes in urban wind\nfields. Yet, for multivariable high-resolution 3D urban microclimate\nprediction, FNO faces three key limitations: blurry output quality, high GPU\nmemory demand, and substantial data requirements. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel localized Fourier neural operator (Local-FNO) model that\nemploys local training, geometry encoding, and patch overlapping. Local-FNO\nprovides accurate predictions for rapidly changing turbulence in urban\nmicroclimate over 60 seconds, four times the average turbulence integral time\nscale, with an average error of 0.35 m/s in velocity and 0.30 {\\deg}C in\ntemperature. It also accurately captures turbulent heat flux represented by the\nvelocity-temperature correlation. In a 2 km by 2 km domain, Local-FNO resolves\nturbulence patterns down to a 10 m resolution. It provides high-resolution\npredictions with 150 million feature dimensions on a single 32 GB GPU at nearly\n50 times the speed of a CFD solver. Compared to FNO, Local-FNO achieves a 23.9%\nreduction in prediction error and a 47.3% improvement in turbulent fluctuation\ncorrelation.",

On\nthe other hand, the saturation value of the thermofield double (TFD) state\ncomplexity can detect the real-complex transition of the eigenvalues on\nincreasing disorder strength. From the saturation value, we also distinguish\nthe model with TRS and without TRS. The charge density wave complexity shows\nlower saturation values in the MBL phase for the model with TRS. However, the\nmodel without TRS shows a completely different behavior, which is also\ncaptivated by our analysis.

Generating videos following the fundamental\nphysical laws is still an opening challenge. To address this challenge, we\npropose a novel method to teach video diffusion models with latent physical\nphenomenon knowledge, enabling the accurate generation of physically informed\nphenomena. Specifically, we first pretrain Masked Autoencoders (MAE) to\nreconstruct the physical phenomena, resulting in output embeddings that\nencapsulate latent physical phenomenon knowledge. Leveraging these embeddings,\nwe could generate the pseudo-language prompt features based on the aligned\nspatial relationships between CLIP vision and language encoders.

This enables the\nmodeling of spatial relationships to produce physical knowledge-informed\npseudo-language prompts. By incorporating these prompt features and fine-tuning\nthe video diffusion model in a parameter-efficient manner, the physical\nknowledge-informed videos are successfully generated.

In this work, we extend the\nstudy along three directions. First, we also consider generally distributed\nWigner matrices with subexponential entries. Second, we include the\ndeterministic matrices into discussion and consider arbitrary polynomials in\nrandom matrices and deterministic matrices. Third, more importantly, we\nconsider the ultra high order cumulants in the sense that $r$ is arbitrary,\ni.e., could be $N$ dependent. Our main results are the upper bounds of the\nultra high order cumulants, for which not only the $N$-dependence but also the\n$r$-dependence become significant. These results are then used to derive three\ntypes of quantitative CLT for the trace of any given self-adjoint polynomial in\nthese random matrix variables: a CLT with a Cram\\'{e}r type correction, a\nBerry-Esseen bound, and a concentration inequality which captures both the\nGaussian tail in the small deviation regime and $M$-dependent tail in the large\ndeviation regime, where $M$ is the degree of the polynomial. In contrast to the\nsecond order freeness which implies the CLT for linear eigenvalue statistics of\npolynomials in random matrices, our study on the ultra high order cumulants\nleads to the quantitative versions of the CLT.",

Many current time series methods\ndecompose time series into multiple sub-series, applying different model\narchitectures and training with an end-to-end overall loss for forecasting.\nHowever, this raises a question: does this overall loss prioritize the\nimportance of critical sub-series within the decomposition for the better\nperformance? To investigate this, we conduct a study on the impact of overall\nloss on existing time series methods with sequence decomposition. Our findings\nreveal that overall loss may introduce bias in model learning, hindering the\nlearning of the prioritization of more significant sub-series and limiting the\nforecasting performance. To address this, we propose a hybrid loss framework\ncombining the global and component losses. This framework introduces component\nlosses for each sub-series alongside the original overall loss. It employs a\ndual min-max algorithm to dynamically adjust weights between the overall loss\nand component losses, and within component losses. This enables the model to\nachieve better performance of current time series methods by focusing on more\ncritical sub-series while still maintaining a low overall loss. We integrate\nour loss framework into several time series methods and evaluate the\nperformance on multiple datasets.

The flare frequency for HR 1099 is one flare per rotation\nperiod. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals peak flare temperatures of 39.44,\n35.96, and 32.48 MK, emission measures of $7 \\times 10^{53}$ to $8 \\times\n10^{54}$ cm$^{-3}$, global abundances of 0.250, 0.299, and 0.362 $Z_\\odot$, and\npeak X-ray luminosities of $ 10^{31.21-32.29}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

Although a wide range of\nspatial and temporal alignment modules have been proposed, they primarily\naddress spatial or temporal misalignments at the video level, while the\nspatio-temporal relationships across different videos at the task level remain\nunderexplored. Recent studies utilize class prototypes to learn task-specific\nfeatures but overlook the spatio-temporal relationships across different videos\nat the task level, especially in the spatial dimension, where these\nrelationships provide rich information. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual\nMotion-Guided Attention Learning method (called DMGAL) for few-shot action\nrecognition, aiming to learn the spatio-temporal relationships from the\nvideo-specific to the task-specific level. To achieve this, we propose a\ncarefully designed Motion-Guided Attention (MGA) method to identify and\ncorrelate motion-related region features from the video level to the task\nlevel. Specifically, the Self Motion-Guided Attention module (S-MGA) achieves\nspatio-temporal relation modeling at the video level by identifying and\ncorrelating motion-related region features between different frames within a\nvideo. The Cross Motion-Guided Attention module (C-MGA) identifies and\ncorrelates motion-related region features between frames of different videos\nwithin a specific task to achieve spatio-temporal relationships at the task\nlevel. This approach enables the model to construct class prototypes that fully\nincorporate spatio-temporal relationships from the video-specific level to the\ntask-specific level. We validate the effectiveness of our DMGAL method by\nemploying both fully fine-tuning and adapter-tuning paradigms.

Here, we show\nthrough first-principles calculations, supported by finite element simulations,\nthat the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bound can be exceeded by the isotropic elastic\nresponse of an anisotropic structure constructed from an anisotropic material.\nThe material and structural anisotropies mutually reinforce each other to\nrealize the overall isotropic response, without incurring the mass penalty\nfaced by the hybridization of geometries with complementary anisotropies. 3\ndesigns were investigated (plate BCC, plate FCC and plate SC) but only plate SC\nyielded a solution for the anisotropic properties of the material, which are\nremarkably similar to that of single crystal nickel and single crystal ferrite.",

We\nrigorously evaluate three representative dataset distillation methods (DATM,\nDANCE, and RCIG) under various noise conditions, including symmetric noise,\nasymmetric noise, and real-world natural noise. Our empirical findings reveal\nthat dataset distillation effectively serves as a denoising tool in random\nnoise scenarios but may struggle with structured asymmetric noise patterns,\nwhich can be absorbed into the distilled samples. Additionally, clean but\nchallenging samples, such as those from tail classes in imbalanced datasets,\nmay undergo lossy compression during distillation. Despite these challenges,\nour results highlight that dataset distillation holds significant promise for\nrobust model training, especially in high-privacy environments where noise is\nprevalent.

Using interferometers and photon-subtraction\ngadgets (PSGs) accompanied by linear amplification and attenuation, we\nestablish linear-optical methods to mitigate and suppress bosonic noise\nchannels. We first show that by employing amplifying and attenuating PSGs\nrespectively at the input and output of either a thermal or random-displacement\nchannel, probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) can be carried out to mitigate\nerrors in expectation-value estimation. We also derive optimal physical\nestimators that are properly constrained to improve the sampling accuracy of\nPEC. Next, we prove that a purely-dephasing channel is coherently suppressible\nusing a multimode Mach--Zehnder interferometer and conditional vacuum\nmeasurements (VMZ). In the limit of infinitely-many ancillas, with nonvanishing\nsuccess rates, VMZ using either Hadamard or two-design interferometers turns\nany dephasing channel into a phase-space-rotated linear-attenuation channel\nthat can subsequently be inverted with (rotated) linear amplification without\nKerr nonlinearity. Moreover, for weak central-Gaussian dephasing, the\nsuppression fidelity increases monotonically with the number of ancillas and\nmost optimally with Hadamard interferometers. We demonstrate the performance of\nthese linear-optical mitigation and suppression schemes on common noise\nchannels (and their compositions) and popular bosonic codes. While the\ntheoretical formalism pertains to idling noise channels, we also provide\nnumerical evidence supporting mitigation and suppression capabilities with\nrespect to noise from universal gate operations.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of medical image segmentation techniques has been propelled\nby the adoption of deep learning techniques, particularly UNet-based\napproaches, which exploit semantic information to improve the accuracy of\nsegmentations. However, the order of organs in scanned images has been\ndisregarded by current medical image segmentation approaches based on UNet.\nFurthermore, the inherent network structure of UNet does not provide direct\ncapabilities for integrating temporal information. To efficiently integrate\ntemporal information, we propose TP-UNet that utilizes temporal prompts,\nencompassing organ-construction relationships, to guide the segmentation UNet\nmodel. Specifically, our framework is featured with cross-attention and\nsemantic alignment based on unsupervised contrastive learning to combine\ntemporal prompts and image features effectively. Extensive evaluations on two\nmedical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art\nperformance of TP-UNet. Our implementation will be open-sourced after\nacceptance.",

    "abstract": "Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for\nbreaking data silos among distributed private graphs. In practical scenarios\ninvolving heterogeneous distributed graph data, personalized Federated Graph\nLearning (pFGL) aims to enhance model utility by training personalized models\ntailored to client needs. However, existing pFGL methods often require numerous\ncommunication rounds under heterogeneous graphs, leading to significant\ncommunication overhead and security concerns. While One-shot Federated Learning\n(OFL) enables collaboration in a single round, existing OFL methods are\ndesigned for image-centric tasks and are ineffective for graph data, leaving a\ncritical gap in the field. Additionally, personalized models derived from\nexisting methods suffer from bias, failing to effectively generalize to the\nminority. To address these challenges, we propose the first \\textbf{O}ne-shot\n\\textbf{p}ersonalized \\textbf{F}ederated \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{L}earning\nmethod (\\textbf{O-pFGL}) for node classification, compatible with Secure\nAggregation protocols for privacy preservation. Specifically, for effective\ngraph learning in one communication round, our method estimates and aggregates\nclass-wise feature distribution statistics to construct a global surrogate\ngraph on the server, facilitating the training of a global graph model. To\nmitigate bias, we introduce a two-stage personalized training approach that\nadaptively balances local personal information and global insights from the\nsurrogate graph, improving both personalization and generalization.

We design an\nalgorithm working in an architecture-friendly manner (AFM), which is a\nprocedure of suppressing performance-degradation factors such as the numbers of\ninstructions, branch mispredictions, and cache misses in CPUs of a modern\ncomputer system. For the AFM operation, we leverage unique universal\ncharacteristics (UCs) of a data-object and a cluster's mean set, which are\nskewed distributions on data relationships such as Zipf's law and a\nfeature-value concentration phenomenon. The UCs indicate that the most part of\nthe number of multiplications for similarity calculations is executed regarding\nterms with high document frequencies (df) and the most part of a similarity\nbetween an object- and a mean-feature vector is obtained by the multiplications\nregarding a few high mean-feature values.

The algorithm determines the two structural\nparameters by minimizing the approximate number of multiplications related to\nthat of instructions, reduces the branch mispredictions by sharing the index\nstructure including the two parameters with all the objects, and suppressing\nthe cache misses by keeping in the caches the frequently used data in the\nforegoing specific region, resulting in working in the AFM.

Device-independent (DI) and measurement-device-independent (MDI)\nQSDC protocols can enhance QSDC's practical security in theory. DI QSDC\nrequires extremely high global detection efficiency and has quite low secure\ncommunication distance. DI and MDI QSDC both require high-quality entanglement.\nCurrent entanglement sources prepare entangled photon pairs with low\nefficiency, largely reducing their practical communication efficiency. In the\npaper, we propose a single-photon-based receiver-device-independent (RDI) QSDC\nprotocol. It only relies on the trusted single-photon source, which is nearly\non-demand under current technology, and treats all the receiving devices in\nboth communication parties as ``black-boxes''. The parties ensure the message\nsecurity only from the observed statistics. We develop a numerical method to\nsimulate its performance in practical noisy communication situation. RDI QSDC\nprovides the same security level as MDI QSDC. Compared with DI and MDI QSDC,\nRDI QSDC has some advantages. First, it uses the single-photon source and\nsingle-photon measurement, which makes it obtain the practical communication\nefficiency about 3415 times of that in DI QSDC and easy to implement. The whole\nprotocol is feasible with current technology. Second, it has higher photon loss\nrobustness and noise tolerance than DI QSDC, which enables it to have a secure\ncommunication distance about 26 times of that in DI QSDC. Based on above\nfeatures, the RDI QSDC protocol makes it possible to achieve highly-secure and\nhigh-efficient QSDC in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised Learning plays a crucial role in network anomaly detection\napplications, however, learning anomaly patterns with limited labeled samples\nis not easy. Additionally, the lack of interpretability creates key barriers to\nthe adoption of semi-supervised frameworks in practice. Most existing\ninterpretation methods are developed for supervised/unsupervised frameworks or\nnon-security domains and fail to provide reliable interpretations. In this\npaper, we propose AnomalyAID, a general framework aiming to (1) make the\nanomaly detection process interpretable and improve the reliability of\ninterpretation results, and (2) assign high-confidence pseudo labels to\nunlabeled samples for improving the performance of anomaly detection systems\nwith limited supervised data. For (1), we propose a novel interpretation\napproach that leverages global and local interpreters to provide reliable\nexplanations, while for (2), we design a new two-stage semi-supervised learning\nframework for network anomaly detection by aligning both stages' model\npredictions with special constraints. We apply AnomalyAID over two\nrepresentative network anomaly detection tasks and extensively evaluate\nAnomalyAID with representative prior works. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat AnomalyAID can provide accurate detection results with reliable\ninterpretations for semi-supervised network anomaly detection systems.

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial tool for clinical diagnosis\nwhile facing the challenge of long scanning time. To reduce the acquisition\ntime, fast MRI reconstruction aims to restore high-quality images from the\nundersampled k-space. Existing methods typically train deep learning models to\nmap the undersampled data to artifact-free MRI images. However, these studies\noften overlook the unique properties of k-space and directly apply general\nnetworks designed for image processing to k-space recovery, leaving the precise\nlearning of k-space largely underexplored. In this work, we propose a\ncontinuous k-space recovery network from a new perspective of implicit neural\nrepresentation with image domain guidance, which boosts the performance of MRI\nreconstruction. Specifically, (1) an implicit neural representation based\nencoder-decoder structure is customized to continuously query unsampled\nk-values. (2) an image guidance module is designed to mine the semantic\ninformation from the low-quality MRI images to further guide the k-space\nrecovery. (3) a multi-stage training strategy is proposed to recover dense\nk-space progressively. Extensive experiments conducted on CC359, fastMRI, and\nIXI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority\nover other competitors.",

Low-thrust trajectory optimization involves the use\nof sequential convex programming (SCP), where a specialized formulation finds\nthe mass-optimal control for each ship's trajectory within seconds. Once a\nfeasible trajectory has been found, the rendezvous times are manually refined\nwith the aid of the control profile from the optimal solution. Each ship's\nindividual solution is then placed into a pool where the feasible set that\nmaximizes the final score is extracted using a genetic algorithm.

    "abstract": "The Audio-Visual Event Localization (AVEL) task aims to temporally locate and\nclassify video events that are both audible and visible. Most research in this\nfield assumes a closed-set setting, which restricts these models' ability to\nhandle test data containing event categories absent (unseen) during training.\nRecently, a few studies have explored AVEL in an open-set setting, enabling the\nrecognition of unseen events as ``unknown'', but without providing\ncategory-specific semantics. In this paper, we advance the field by introducing\nthe Open-Vocabulary Audio-Visual Event Localization (OV-AVEL) problem, which\nrequires localizing audio-visual events and predicting explicit categories for\nboth seen and unseen data at inference. To address this new task, we propose\nthe OV-AVEBench dataset, comprising 24,800 videos across 67 real-life\naudio-visual scenes (seen:unseen = 46:21), each with manual segment-level\nannotation. We also establish three evaluation metrics for this task. Moreover,\nwe investigate two baseline approaches, one training-free and one using a\nfurther fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we utilize the unified multimodal\nspace from the pretrained ImageBind model to extract audio, visual, and textual\n(event classes) features. The training-free baseline then determines\npredictions by comparing the consistency of audio-text and visual-text feature\nsimilarities. The fine-tuning baseline incorporates lightweight temporal layers\nto encode temporal relations within the audio and visual modalities, using\nOV-AVEBench training data for model fine-tuning. We evaluate these baselines on\nthe proposed OV-AVEBench dataset and discuss potential directions for future\nwork in this new field.",

    "abstract": "We study the maximum set coverage problem in the massively parallel model. In\nthis setting, $m$ sets that are subsets of a universe of $n$ elements are\ndistributed among $m$ machines. In each round, these machines can communicate\nwith each other, subject to the memory constraint that no machine may use more\nthan $\\tilde{O}(n)$ memory. The objective is to find the $k$ sets whose\ncoverage is maximized. We consider the regime where $k = \\Omega(m)$, $m =\nO(n)$, and each machine has $\\tilde{O}(n)$ memory. Maximum coverage is a\nspecial case of the submodular maximization problem subject to a cardinality\nconstraint. This problem can be approximated to within a $1-1/e$ factor using\nthe greedy algorithm, but this approach is not directly applicable to parallel\nand distributed models. When $k = \\Omega(m)$, to obtain a $1-1/e-\\epsilon$\napproximation, previous work either requires $\\tilde{O}(mn)$ memory per machine\nwhich is not interesting compared to the trivial algorithm that sends the\nentire input to a single machine, or requires $2^{O(1/\\epsilon)} n$ memory per\nmachine which is prohibitively expensive even for a moderately small value\n$\\epsilon$. Our result is a randomized $(1-1/e-\\epsilon)$-approximation\nalgorithm that uses $O(1/\\epsilon^3 \\cdot \\log m \\cdot (\\log (1/\\epsilon) +\n\\log m))$ rounds.

    "abstract": "The Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is an innovative approach to solve\na diverse array of partial differential equations (PDEs) leveraging the power\nof neural networks. This is achieved by minimizing the residual loss associated\nwith the explicit physical information, usually coupled with data derived from\ninitial and boundary conditions. However, a challenge arises in the context of\nnonlinear conservation laws where derivatives are undefined at shocks, leading\nto solutions that deviate from the true physical phenomena. To solve this\nissue, the physical solution must be extracted from the weak formulation of the\nPDE and is typically further bounded by entropy conditions. Within the\nnumerical framework, finite volume methods (FVM) are employed to address\nconservation laws. These methods resolve the integral form of conservation laws\nand delineate the shock characteristics. Inspired by the principles underlying\nFVM, this paper introduces a novel Coupled Integrated PINN methodology that\ninvolves fitting the integral solutions of equations using additional neural\nnetworks. This technique not only augments the conventional PINN's capability\nin modeling shock waves, but also eliminates the need for spatial and temporal\ndiscretization. As such, it bypasses the complexities of numerical integration\nand reconstruction associated with non-convex fluxes. Finally, we show that the\nproposed new Integrated PINN performs well in conservative law and outperforms\nthe vanilla PINN when tackle the challenging shock problems using examples of\nBurger's equation, Buckley-Leverett Equation and Euler System.",

We investigate this problem through the lens of lossless\nsource coding, also sometimes referred to as lossless compression, from both an\nalgorithmic and information-theoretic perspective.\n  Lossless compression algorithms typically preserve the ordering in which data\npoints are compressed. However, there are data types where order is not\nmeaningful, such as collections of files, rows in a database, nodes in a graph,\nand, notably, datasets in machine learning applications.\n  Compressing with traditional algorithms is possible if we pick an order for\nthe elements and communicate the corresponding ordered sequence. However,\nunless the order information is somehow removed during the encoding process,\nthis procedure will be sub-optimal, because the order contains information and\ntherefore more bits are used to represent the source than are truly necessary.\n  In this work we give a formal definition for non-sequential objects as random\nsets of equivalent sequences, which we refer to as Combinatorial Random\nVariables (CRVs). The definition of equivalence, formalized as an equivalence\nrelation, establishes the non-sequential data type represented by the CRV. The\nachievable rates of CRVs is fully characterized as a function of the\nequivalence relation as well as the data distribution.\n  The optimal rates of CRVs are achieved within the family of Random\nPermutation Codes (RPCs) developed in later chapters.

These are an important class of processes, which frequently appear in\napplications such as mathematical finance, biology and opinion dynamics.\nTypically the stationary distribution is unknown and indeed one cannot simulate\nsuch processes exactly. As a result one commonly requires a time-discretization\nscheme which results in a discretization bias and a bias from not being able to\nsimulate the associated stationary distribution. To overcome this bias, we\npresent a new unbiased estimator taking motivation from the literature on\nunbiased Monte Carlo. We prove the unbiasedness of our estimator, under\nassumptions. In order to prove this we require developing ergodicity results of\nvarious discrete time processes, through an appropriate discretization scheme,\ntowards the invariant measure. Numerous numerical experiments are provided, on\na range of MVSDEs, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our unbiased estimator.\nSuch examples include the Currie-Weiss model, a 3D neuroscience model and a\nparameter estimation problem.",

Remarkably, clog suppression is very effective even when the obstacle\ncross-section is comparable to that of a single grain, and is only a small\nfraction of the outlet area. Data from two dissimilar obstacle shapes indicate\nthat the underlying mechanism for clog suppression is geometric: while the\nmagnitude of the effect can be affected by dynamical factors, the optimal\nlocation of the obstacle is determined entirely by a simple geometric rule. An\noptimally-placed obstacle arranges for the most-probable clogging arch to be at\na perilous and unstable spot, where the local flow geometry is at a point of\nexpansion and a slight perturbation leaves the arch without downstream support.\nThis geometric principle does not rely on previously conjectured dynamical\nmechanisms and admits generalization to other agent-based and particulate\nsystems.",

Finally, the speech waveform is reconstructed\nthrough the inverse short-time Fourier transform (ISTFT).

The\nexcitation provides the filter with prior knowledge of the amplitude and phase\npatterns, expecting to reduce the modeling difficulty compared to conventional\nneural vocoders. To ensure the fidelity of the synthesized speech, an\nadversarial training strategy is applied to ESTVocoder with multi-scale and\nmulti-resolution discriminators. Analysis-synthesis and text-to-speech\nexperiments both confirm that our proposed ESTVocoder outperforms or is\ncomparable to other baseline neural vocoders, e.g., HiFi-GAN, SiFi-GAN, and\nVocos, in terms of synthesized speech quality, with a reasonable model\ncomplexity and generation speed.

As CEE relaxes the requirement\nfor ``perfect'' counterfactual samples (e.g., patients with identical\nattributes and only differ in treatments received) that are impractical to\nobtain and can instead operate on observational data, it is usually used in\nhigh-stake domains like medical treatment effect prediction. Nevertheless, in\nthose high-stake domains, gathering a decently sized, fully labelled\nobservational dataset remains challenging due to hurdles associated with costs,\nethics, expertise and time needed, etc., of which medical treatment surveys are\na typical example. Consequently, if the training dataset is small in scale, low\ngeneralization risks can hardly be achieved on any CEE algorithms.\n  Unlike existing CEE methods that assume the constant availability of a\ndataset with abundant samples, in this paper, we study a more realistic CEE\nsetting where the labelled data samples are scarce at the beginning, while more\ncan be gradually acquired over the course of training -- assuredly under a\nlimited budget considering their expensive nature. Then, the problem naturally\ncomes down to actively selecting the best possible samples to be labelled,\ne.g., identifying the next subset of patients to conduct the treatment survey.\nHowever, acquiring quality data for reducing the CEE risk under limited\nlabelling budgets remains under-explored until now. To fill the gap, we\ntheoretically analyse the generalization risk from an intriguing perspective of\nprogressively shrinking its upper bound, and develop a principled label\nacquisition pipeline exclusively for CEE tasks.

Candidate\nstructures are ranked based on cosine similarity between the embeddings of\nquery spectrum and each candidate. We evaluate JESTR against mol-to-spec and\nspec-to-FP annotation tools on three datasets. On average, for rank@[1-5],\nJESTR outperforms other tools by 23.6%-71.6%. We further demonstrate the strong\nvalue of regularization with candidate molecules during training, boosting\nrank@1 performance by 11.4% and enhancing the model's ability to discern\nbetween target and candidate molecules. When comparing JESTR's performance\nagainst that of publicly available pretrained models of SIRIUS and CFM-ID on\nappropriate subsets of MassSpecGym benchmark dataset, JESTR outperforms these\ntools by 31% and 238%, respectively.

The best candidate to be the original host progenitor of\n$\\omega$Cen is the tidally disrupted dwarf $Gaia$-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE), a\nformer Milky Way satellite as massive as the Large Magellanic Cloud. I compare\n$\\omega$Cen/GSE with other central BH hosts and place it within the broader\ncontext of BH-galaxy (co)evolution. The IMBH of $\\omega$Cen/GSE follows the\nscaling relation between central BH mass and host stellar mass (${\\rm M}_{\\rm\nBH}{-}{\\rm M}_\\star$) extrapolated from local massive galaxies (${\\rm M}_\\star\n\\gtrsim 10^{10}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$).

    "abstract": "In heliophysics research, predicting solar flares is crucial due to their\npotential to impact both space-based systems and Earth's infrastructure\nsubstantially. Magnetic field data from solar active regions, recorded by solar\nimaging observatories, are transformed into multivariate time series to enable\nsolar flare prediction using temporal window-based analysis. In the realm of\nmultivariate time series-driven solar flare prediction, addressing severe class\nimbalance with effective strategies for multivariate time series representation\nlearning is key to developing robust predictive models. Traditional methods\noften struggle with overfitting to the majority class in prediction tasks where\nmajor solar flares are infrequent. This work presents EXCON, a contrastive\nrepresentation learning framework designed to enhance classification\nperformance amidst such imbalances. EXCON operates through four stages:\nobtaining core features from multivariate time series data; selecting\ndistinctive contrastive representations for each class to maximize inter-class\nseparation; training a temporal feature embedding module with a custom extreme\nreconstruction loss to minimize intra-class variation; and applying a\nclassifier to the learned embeddings for robust classification. The proposed\nmethod leverages contrastive learning principles to map similar instances\ncloser in the feature space while distancing dissimilar ones, a strategy not\nextensively explored in solar flare prediction tasks. This approach not only\naddresses class imbalance but also offers a versatile solution applicable to\nunivariate and multivariate time series across binary and multiclass\nclassification problems. Experimental results, including evaluations on the\nbenchmark solar flare dataset and multiple time series archive datasets with\nbinary and multiclass labels, demonstrate EXCON's efficacy in enhancing\nclassification performance.",

Consequently, the question of whether AI can\naccurately interpret human emotions remains a critical challenge. To date, two\nprimary classes of AI models have been involved in human emotion analysis:\ngenerative models and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To assess the\nemotional capabilities of these two classes of models, this study introduces\nMEMO-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 7,145 portraits, each\ndepicting one of six different emotions, generated by 12 Text-to-Image (T2I)\nmodels. Unlike previous works, MEMO-Bench provides a framework for evaluating\nboth T2I models and MLLMs in the context of sentiment analysis. Additionally, a\nprogressive evaluation approach is employed, moving from coarse-grained to\nfine-grained metrics, to offer a more detailed and comprehensive assessment of\nthe sentiment analysis capabilities of MLLMs. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that existing T2I models are more effective at generating positive\nemotions than negative ones. Meanwhile, although MLLMs show a certain degree of\neffectiveness in distinguishing and recognizing human emotions, they fall short\nof human-level accuracy, particularly in fine-grained emotion analysis. The\nMEMO-Bench will be made publicly available to support further research in this\narea.",

These methods utilized limited aspects of\nspeech information for MOS prediction, resulting in restricted prediction\naccuracy.

This study aimed to develop a novel\nproteomics-based risk prediction model specifically for Asian SLE populations\nto enhance personalized disease management and early intervention. Methods: A\nlongitudinal cohort study was conducted over 48 weeks, including 139 SLE\npatients monitored every 12 weeks. Patients were classified into flare (n = 53)\nand non-flare (n = 86) groups. Baseline plasma samples underwent\ndata-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics analysis, and phenome-wide\nMendelian randomization (PheWAS) was performed to evaluate causal relationships\nbetween proteins and clinical predictors. Logistic regression (LR) and random\nforest (RF) models were used to integrate proteomic and clinical data for flare\nrisk prediction. Results: Five proteins (SAA1, B4GALT5, GIT2, NAA15, and RPIA)\nwere significantly associated with SLE Disease Activity Index-2K (SLEDAI-2K)\nscores and 1-year flare risk, implicating key pathways such as B-cell receptor\nsignaling and platelet degranulation. SAA1 demonstrated causal effects on\nflare-related clinical markers, including hemoglobin and red blood cell counts.\nA combined model integrating clinical and proteomic data achieved the highest\npredictive accuracy (AUC = 0.769), surpassing individual models. SAA1 was\nhighlighted as a priority biomarker for rapid flare discrimination. Conclusion:\nThe integration of proteomic and clinical data significantly improves flare\nprediction in Asian SLE patients. The identification of key proteins and their\ncausal relationships with flare-related clinical markers provides valuable\ninsights for proactive SLE management and personalized therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Aggregators of distributed energy resources are increasingly encouraged to\nparticipate in wholesale market bidding. However, the delivery of the power\nthey are awarded can result in over-voltage or congestion issues within the\ndistribution network (DN). The opportunity to lease energy storage from the\nutility that manages the DN provides the aggregator with a means to mitigate\nthese issues, while also benefiting the utility in terms of additional lease\nrevenue. Nevertheless, this leasing opportunity considerably complicates the\naggregator's offer-making process, as it requires the consideration of market\nuncertainties, uncertain power injection at DN buses, and the strategic\ninteractions between the aggregator and the utility. This paper presents a\nstochastic Stackelberg game model that effectively captures the interactions\nbetween the aggregator and the utility, ensuring DN security across all\npotential uncertainty scenarios. Furthermore, in light of the privacy concerns\nof both the aggregator and the utility, two distributed solution methods are\nproposed. The first method follows a traditional predict-then-optimize\nframework and has been validated to achieve the game equilibrium. The second\nmethod employs an end-to-end framework, which has been empirically shown to\nyield superior economic results.

    "abstract": "With the rise of e-commerce and short videos, online recommender systems that\ncan capture users' interests and update new items in real-time play an\nincreasingly important role. In both online and offline recommendation systems,\nthe cold-start problem caused by interaction sparsity has been impacting the\neffectiveness of recommendations for cold-start items. Many cold-start scheme\nbased on fine-tuning or knowledge transferring shows excellent performance on\noffline recommendation. Yet, these schemes are infeasible for online\nrecommendation on streaming data pipelines due to different training method,\ncomputational overhead and time constraints. Inspired by the above questions,\nwe propose a model-agnostic recommendation algorithm called Popularity-Aware\nMeta-learning (PAM), to address the item cold-start problem under streaming\ndata settings. PAM divides the incoming data into different meta-learning tasks\nby predefined item popularity thresholds. The model can distinguish and\nreweight behavior-related and content-related features in each task based on\ntheir different roles in different popularity levels, thus adapting to\nrecommendations for cold-start samples. These task-fixing design significantly\nreduces additional computation and storage costs compared to offline methods.\nFurthermore, PAM also introduced data augmentation and an additional\nself-supervised loss specifically designed for low-popularity tasks, leveraging\ninsights from high-popularity samples. This approach effectively mitigates the\nissue of inadequate supervision due to the scarcity of cold-start samples.\nExperimental results across multiple public datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our approach over other baseline methods in addressing\ncold-start challenges in online streaming data scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained vision-language models provide a robust foundation for efficient\ntransfer learning across various downstream tasks. In the field of video action\nrecognition, mainstream approaches often introduce additional modules to\ncapture temporal information. Although the additional modules increase the\ncapacity of model, enabling it to better capture video-specific inductive\nbiases, existing methods typically introduce a substantial number of new\nparameters and are prone to catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired\ngeneralizable knowledge. In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient\nMulti-modal Spatio-Temporal Adapter (MSTA) to enhance the alignment between\ntextual and visual representations, achieving a balance between generalizable\nknowledge and task-specific adaptation. Furthermore, to mitigate over-fitting\nand enhance generalizability, we introduce a spatio-temporal description-guided\nconsistency constraint.This constraint involves providing template inputs\n(e.g., \"a video of \\{\\textbf{cls}\\}\") to the trainable language branch and\nLLM-generated spatio-temporal descriptions to the pre-trained language branch,\nenforcing output consistency between the branches. This approach reduces\noverfitting to downstream tasks and enhances the distinguishability of the\ntrainable branch within the spatio-temporal semantic space. We evaluate the\neffectiveness of our approach across four tasks: zero-shot transfer, few-shot\nlearning, base-to-novel generalization, and fully-supervised learning. Compared\nto many state-of-the-art methods, our MSTA achieves outstanding performance\nacross all evaluations, while using only 2-7\\% of the trainable parameters in\nthe original model.",

    "abstract": "Context-aware methods have achieved remarkable advancements in supervised\nscene text recognition by leveraging semantic priors from words. Considering\nthe heterogeneity of text and background in STR, we propose that such\ncontextual priors can be reinterpreted as the relations between textual\nelements, serving as effective self-supervised labels for representation\nlearning. However, textual relations are restricted to the finite size of the\ndataset due to lexical dependencies, which causes over-fitting problem, thus\ncompromising the representation quality. To address this, our work introduces a\nunified framework of Relational Contrastive Learning and Masked Image Modeling\nfor STR (RCMSTR), which explicitly models the enriched textual relations. For\nthe RCL branch, we first introduce the relational rearrangement module to\ncultivate new relations on the fly. Based on this, we further conduct\nrelational contrastive learning to model the intra- and inter-hierarchical\nrelations for frames, sub-words and words. On the other hand, MIM can naturally\nboost the context information via masking, where we find that the block masking\nstrategy is more effective for STR. For the effective integration of RCL and\nMIM, we also introduce a novel decoupling design aimed at mitigating the impact\nof masked images on contrastive learning. Additionally, to enhance the\ncompatibility of MIM with CNNs, we propose the adoption of sparse convolutions\nand directly sharing the weights with dense convolutions in training. The\nproposed RCMSTR demonstrates superior performance in various evaluation\nprotocols for different STR-related downstream tasks, outperforming the\nexisting state-of-the-art self-supervised STR techniques. Ablation studies and\nqualitative experimental results further validate the effectiveness of our\nmethod.

Our\nfindings indicate that MSE, despite its traditional association with regression\ntasks, serves as a viable alternative for classification problems, challenging\nconventional wisdom about neural network training strategies.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the dust content of galaxies, its evolution with redshift and\nits relationship to stars and star formation is fundamental for our\nunderstanding of galaxy evolution. Using the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS)\nwide-area band-6 continuum dataset ($\\sim\\,$110 arcmin$^2$ across 33 lensing\nclusters), we aimed at constraining the dust mass evolution with redshift,\nstellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). After binning sources according to\nredshift, SFR and stellar mass -- extracted from an HST-IRAC catalog -- we\nperformed a set of continuum stacking analyses in the image domain using\n\\textsc{LineStacker} on sources between $z=1$ and $z=5$, further improving the\ndepth of our data. The large field of view provided by the ALCS allows us to\nreach a final sample of $\\sim4000$ galaxies with known coordinates and\nSED-derived physical parameters. We stack sources with SFR between $10^{-3}$\nand $10^{3}$ M$_\\odot$ per year, and stellar mass between $10^{8}$ and\n$10^{12}$ M$_\\odot$, splitting them in different stellar mass and SFR bins.\nThrough stacking we retrieve the continuum 1.2\\,mm flux, a known dust mass\ntracer, allowing us to derive the dust mass evolution with redshift and its\nrelation with SFR and stellar mass. We observe clear continuum detections in\nthe majority of the subsamples. From the non detections we derive 3-$\\sigma$\nupper limits. We observe a steady decline in the average dust mass with\nredshift. Moreover, sources with higher stellar mass or SFR have higher dust\nmass on average, allowing us to derive scaling relations. Our results are\nmostly in good agreement with models at $z\\sim1$-3, but indicate typically\nlower dust-mass than predicted at higher redshift.",

    "abstract": "Effective toxic content detection relies heavily on high-quality and diverse\ndata, which serve as the foundation for robust content moderation models.\nSynthetic data has become a common approach for training models across various\nNLP tasks. However, its effectiveness remains uncertain for highly subjective\ntasks like hate speech detection, with previous research yielding mixed\nresults. This study explores the potential of open-source LLMs for harmful data\nsynthesis, utilizing controlled prompting and supervised fine-tuning techniques\nto enhance data quality and diversity. We systematically evaluated 6 open\nsource LLMs on 5 datasets, assessing their ability to generate diverse,\nhigh-quality harmful data while minimizing hallucination and duplication. Our\nresults show that Mistral consistently outperforms other open models, and\nsupervised fine-tuning significantly enhances data reliability and diversity.\nWe further analyze the trade-offs between prompt-based vs. fine-tuned toxic\ndata synthesis, discuss real-world deployment challenges, and highlight ethical\nconsiderations. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuned open source LLMs\nprovide scalable and cost-effective solutions to augment toxic content\ndetection datasets, paving the way for more accessible and transparent content\nmoderation tools.",

    "abstract": "Most robotics applications are typically accompanied with safety restrictions\nthat need to be satisfied with a high degree of confidence even in environments\nunder uncertainty. Controlling the state distribution of a system and enforcing\nsuch specifications as distribution constraints is a promising approach for\nmeeting such requirements. In this direction, covariance steering (CS) is an\nincreasingly popular stochastic optimal control (SOC) framework for designing\nsafe controllers via explicit constraints on the system covariance.\nNevertheless, a major challenge in applying CS methods to systems with the\nnonlinear dynamics and chance constraints common in robotics is that the\napproximations needed are conservative and highly sensitive to the point of\napproximation. This can cause sequential convex programming methods to converge\nto poor local minima or incorrectly report problems as infeasible due to\nshifting constraints. This paper presents a novel algorithm for solving\nchance-constrained nonlinear CS problems that directly addresses this\nchallenge. Specifically, we propose an operator-splitting approach that\ntemporarily separates the main problem into subproblems that can be solved in\nparallel. The benefit of this relaxation lies in the fact that it does not\nrequire all iterates to satisfy all constraints simultaneously prior to\nconvergence, thus enhancing the exploration capabilities of the algorithm for\nfinding better solutions. Simulation results verify the ability of the proposed\nmethod to find higher quality solutions under stricter safety constraints than\nstandard methods on a variety of robotic systems. Finally, the applicability of\nthe algorithm on real systems is confirmed through hardware demonstrations.",

At the output, frequency combs with continuously tunable mode\nspacings are generated in the frequency domain, and coherent pulse trains with\ncontinuously tunable repetition rates are generated in the time domain. Our\nresults pave the way for fully tunable chip-scale lasers and frequency combs,\nadvantageous for use in a diverse variety of fields, from fundamental studies\nto applications such as high-resolution and dual-comb spectroscopy.",
