    "abstract": "Humans engage in lifelong social interactions through interacting with\ndifferent people under different scenarios for different social goals. This\nrequires social intelligence to gather information through a long time span and\nuse it to navigate various social contexts effectively. Whether AI systems are\nalso capable of this is understudied in the existing research. In this paper,\nwe present a novel benchmark, LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, to perform a comprehensive\nevaluation of language agents by simulating multi-episode interactions. In each\nepisode, the language agents role-play characters to achieve their respective\nsocial goals in randomly sampled social tasks. With LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, we find\nthat goal achievement and believability of all of the language models that we\ntest decline through the whole interaction. Although using an advanced memory\nmethod improves the agents' performance, the best agents still achieve a\nsignificantly lower goal completion rate than humans on scenarios requiring an\nexplicit understanding of interaction history. These findings show that we can\nuse LIFELONG-SOTOPIA to evaluate the social intelligence of language agents\nover lifelong social interactions.",

In response, we\nintroduce anira, an efficient cross-platform library. To ensure compatibility\nwith a broad range of neural network architectures and frameworks, anira\nsupports ONNX Runtime, LibTorch, and TensorFlow Lite as backends. Each\ninference engine exhibits real-time violations, which anira mitigates by\ndecoupling the inference from the audio callback to a static thread pool. The\nlibrary incorporates built-in latency management and extensive benchmarking\ncapabilities, both crucial to ensure a continuous signal flow. Three different\nneural network architectures for audio effect emulation are then subjected to\nbenchmarking across various configurations. Statistical modeling is employed to\nidentify the influence of various factors on performance. The findings indicate\nthat for stateless models, ONNX Runtime exhibits the lowest runtimes. For\nstateful models, LibTorch demonstrates the fastest performance.

Traditional sequential recommender systems utilize the order of items\nin users' historical interactions to predict the next item for the users.\nPosition embeddings, well-established in transformer-based architectures for\nnatural language processing tasks, effectively distinguish token positions in\nsequences. In sequential recommendation systems, position embeddings can\ncapture the order of items in a user's historical interaction sequence.\nNevertheless, this ordering does not consider the time elapsed between two\ninteractions of the same user (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month), referred to as\n\"user rhythm\". In mobile app recommendation datasets, the time between\nconsecutive user interactions is notably longer compared to other domains like\nmovies, posing significant challenges for sequential recommender systems. To\naddress this phenomenon in the mobile app domain, we introduce INTERPOS, an\nInteraction Rhythm Guided Positional Morphing strategy for autoregressive\nmobile app recommender systems. INTERPOS incorporates rhythm-guided position\nembeddings, providing a more comprehensive representation that considers both\nthe sequential order of interactions and the temporal gaps between them. This\napproach enables a deep understanding of users' rhythms at a fine-grained\nlevel, capturing the intricacies of their interaction patterns over time. We\npropose three strategies to incorporate the morphed positional embeddings in\ntwo transformer-based sequential recommendation system architectures.

Each\ncaptures a different dimension of user intent. While CRS models lack\ncollaborative signals, leading to generic or poorly personalized suggestions,\ntraditional recommenders lack mechanisms to interactively elicit immediate\nneeds. Unifying these paradigms promises richer personalization but remains\nchallenging due to the lack of large-scale conversational datasets grounded in\nreal user behavior. We present ConvRecStudio, a framework that uses large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to simulate realistic, multi-turn dialogs grounded in\ntimestamped user-item interactions and reviews. ConvRecStudio follows a\nthree-stage pipeline: (1) Temporal Profiling, which constructs user profiles\nand community-level item sentiment trajectories over fine-grained aspects; (2)\nSemantic Dialog Planning, which generates a structured plan using a DAG of\nflexible super-nodes; and (3) Multi-Turn Simulation, which instantiates the\nplan using paired LLM agents for the user and system, constrained by\nexecutional and behavioral fidelity checks. We apply ConvRecStudio to three\ndomains -- MobileRec, Yelp, and Amazon Electronics -- producing over 12K\nmulti-turn dialogs per dataset. Human and automatic evaluations confirm the\nnaturalness, coherence, and behavioral grounding of the generated\nconversations. To demonstrate utility, we build a cross-attention transformer\nmodel that jointly encodes user history and dialog context, achieving gains in\nHit@K and NDCG@K over baselines using either signal alone or naive fusion.\nNotably, our model achieves a 10.9% improvement in Hit@1 on Yelp over the\nstrongest baseline.",

While LFHQCD has been successfully applied to\nhadronic spectroscopy and parton distributions, its potential for modeling\ntransport phenomena remains unexplored. We develop a light-front framework to\ncompute key transport coefficients-such as shear viscosity, bulk viscosity, and\nthe jet quenching parameter-by introducing finite-temperature and density\neffects via holographic black brane backgrounds and incorporating metric\nfluctuations in the AdS bulk. Using the light-front Schrodinger equation with\ntemperature-modified effective potentials, we derive analytic and numerical\nresults for the dissipative response functions of the strongly coupled\nquark-gluon plasma. Our approach leverages the Minkowski-space wavefunctions of\nLFHQCD, enabling real-time modeling of pre-equilibrium and thermalization\ndynamics inaccessible to Euclidean lattice simulations.

Such structured\nrepresentations are well-suited for standard convolution and FFT (Fast Fourier\nTransform) operations and enable efficient learning of mappings between encoded\ninput-output pairs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Many local Lipschitz assumptions have been\nproposed, which have lead to results showing that adaptive step sizes and/or\nline searches yield improved convergence rates over fixed step sizes.

    "abstract": "Interference widely exists in communication systems and is often not\noptimally treated at the receivers due to limited knowledge and/or\ncomputational burden. Evolutions of receivers have been proposed to balance\ncomplexity and spectral efficiency, for example, for 6G, while commonly used\nperformance metrics, such as capacity and mutual information, fail to capture\nthe suboptimal treatment of interference, leading to potentially inaccurate\nperformance evaluations. Mismatched decoding is an information-theoretic tool\nfor analyzing communications with suboptimal decoders. In this work, we use\nmismatched decoding to analyze communications with decoders that treat\ninterference suboptimally, aiming at more accurate performance metrics.\nSpecifically, we consider a finite-alphabet input Gaussian channel under\ninterference, representative of modern systems, where the decoder can be\nmatched (optimal) or mismatched (suboptimal) to the channel. The matched\ncapacity is derived using Mutual Information (MI), while a lower bound on the\nmismatched capacity under various decoding metrics is derived using the\nGeneralized Mutual Information (GMI). We show that the decoding metric in the\nproposed channel model is closely related to the behavior of the demodulator in\nBit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) systems. Simulations illustrate that\nGMI/MI accurately predicts the throughput performance of BICM-type systems.\nFinally, we extend the channel model and the GMI to multiple antenna cases,\nwith an example of multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) precoder\noptimization problem considering GMI under different decoding strategies.

    "abstract": "This study presents a deep neural network (DNN) framework that accelerates\nDirect Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) computations for rarefied-gas flows, while\nmaintaining high physical fidelity. First, a fully connected deep neural\nnetwork is trained on high-quality DSMC data for seven temperatures (200-650 K)\nto reproduce the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution of argon. Injecting the\nphysical boundary point into the training set enforces the correct low-speed\nlimit. It reduces the mean-squared error to below 10^-5, thereby decreasing\ninference time from tens of minutes per DSMC run to milliseconds. For\none-dimensional shock waves, a multi-output network equipped with learnable\nFourier features learns the complete profiles of density, velocity, and\ntemperature. Trained only on Mach numbers 1.4-1.9, it predicts a Mach 2 and 2.5\ncase with near-perfect agreement to DSMC, demonstrating robust out-of-training\ngeneralization. In a lid-driven cavity, the large parametric spread in Knudsen\nnumber is handled by a \"family-of-experts\" strategy: separate specialist models\nare trained at discrete Knudsen (Kn) values, and log-space interpolation fuses\ntheir outputs. This hybrid surrogate recovers the full 2-D velocity and\ntemperature fields at unseen Kn with less than 2% spatial error. Key\ninnovations include (i) explicit injection of physical constraints during data\npreprocessing, (ii) learnable Fourier feature mapping to capture steep shock\ngradients, and (iii) a modular expert-interpolation scheme to cover wide\nKnudsen ranges. Together, they establish a general recipe for trustworthy,\nrapid surrogate models that can be extended to non-equilibrium phenomena, gas\nmixtures, and design optimization workflows",

For the trapped-ion system, a number of methods of\nreconstructing the quantum states have been developed, including the\nmeasurement of the Q quasi-probability function and the density matrix elements\nin the Fock basis, but these approaches are often slow and difficult to scale\nto multi-mode states. Here, we demonstrate a novel and powerful scheme for\nreconstructing a continuous-variable quantum state that uses the direct\nsingle-shot measurement of the joint parity of the phonon states of a trapped\nion. We drive a spin-dependent bichromatic beam-splitter interaction that\ncoherently exchanges phonons between different harmonic oscillator modes of the\nion. This interaction encodes the joint parity information into the relative\nphase between the two spin states, enabling measurement of the combined\nphonon-number parity across multiple modes in a single shot. Leveraging this\ncapability, we directly measure multi-mode Wigner quasi-probability\ndistributions to perform quantum state tomography of an entangled coherent\nstate, and show that the generated state is non-positive under partial\ntranspose, confirming its entanglement. We further show that the single-shot\njoint parity measurement can be used to detect parity-flip errors in real time.\nBy post-selecting the parity measurement outcomes, we experimentally\ndemonstrate the extension of the bosonic state lifetime, effectively\nimplementing an error mitigation technique. Lastly, we identify the various\nsources of error affecting the fidelity of the spin-dependent beam-splitter\noperation and study the feasibility of high fidelity operations. The\ninteraction studied in this work can be easily extended to more than two modes,\nand is highly relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing and quantum\nmetrology.",

An\nexception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads\nH0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse\nadjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse\nnarrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a\nmathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points\nand directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge\nof specific events. This topological approach advances computational social\nscience by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during\ncrises, protests, and information shocks.",

    "abstract": "A new class of audio deepfakes-codecfakes (CFs)-has recently caught\nattention, synthesized by Audio Language Models that leverage neural audio\ncodecs (NACs) in the backend. In response, the community has introduced\ndedicated benchmarks and tailored detection strategies. As the field advances,\nefforts have moved beyond binary detection toward source attribution, including\nopen-set attribution, which aims to identify the NAC responsible for generation\nand flag novel, unseen ones during inference. This shift toward source\nattribution improves forensic interpretability and accountability. However,\nopen-set attribution remains fundamentally limited: while it can detect that a\nNAC is unfamiliar, it cannot characterize or identify individual unseen codecs.\nIt treats such inputs as generic ``unknowns'', lacking insight into their\ninternal configuration. This leads to major shortcomings: limited\ngeneralization to new NACs and inability to resolve fine-grained variations\nwithin NAC families. To address these gaps, we propose Neural Audio Codec\nSource Parsing (NACSP) - a paradigm shift that reframes source attribution for\nCFs as structured regression over generative NAC parameters such as quantizers,\nbandwidth, and sampling rate. We formulate NACSP as a multi-task regression\ntask for predicting these NAC parameters and establish the first comprehensive\nbenchmark using various state-of-the-art speech pre-trained models (PTMs). To\nthis end, we propose HYDRA, a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic\ngeometry to disentangle complex latent properties from PTM representations. By\nemploying task-specific attention over multiple curvature-aware hyperbolic\nsubspaces, HYDRA enables superior multi-task generalization. Our extensive\nexperiments show HYDRA achieves top results on benchmark CFs datasets compared\nto baselines operating in Euclidean space.",

    "abstract": "The game-theoretic notion of the semivalue offers a popular framework for\ncredit attribution and data valuation in machine learning. Semivalues have been\nproposed for a variety of high-stakes decisions involving data, such as\ndetermining contributor compensation, acquiring data from external sources, or\nfiltering out low-value datapoints. In these applications, semivalues depend on\nthe specification of a utility function that maps subsets of data to a scalar\nscore. While it is broadly agreed that this utility function arises from a\ncomposition of a learning algorithm and a performance metric, its actual\ninstantiation involves numerous subtle modeling choices. We argue that this\nunderspecification leads to varying degrees of arbitrariness in semivalue-based\nvaluations. Small, but arguably reasonable changes to the utility function can\ninduce substantial shifts in valuations across datapoints. Moreover, these\nvaluation methodologies are also often gameable: low-cost adversarial\nstrategies exist to exploit this ambiguity and systematically redistribute\nvalue among datapoints. Through theoretical constructions and empirical\nexamples, we demonstrate that a bad-faith valuator can manipulate utility\nspecifications to favor preferred datapoints, and that a good-faith valuator is\nleft without principled guidance to justify any particular specification. These\nvulnerabilities raise ethical and epistemic concerns about the use of\nsemivalues in several applications. We conclude by highlighting the burden of\njustification that semivalue-based approaches place on modelers and discuss\nimportant considerations for identifying appropriate uses.",

Study 2 examined how LLMs prioritize these themes\nthrough repeated rankings. Results revealed consistent value structures across\ntrials, with Ethical Integrity and Purposeful Contribution emerging as top\npriorities. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analyses\nfurther uncovered two distinct value profiles: human-centric models emphasizing\nethical and relational dimensions, and utility-driven models prioritizing\nperformance and scalability. The PAPERS framework bridges insights from human\nflourishing and human-computer interaction, offering a conceptual foundation\nfor understanding artificial intelligence (AI) well-being in non-sentient and\npotentially sentient systems.

To\naddress two primary challenges of VH, namely insufficient visual attention and\nthe dominance of language priors, we identify three problematic attention\nbehaviors in LVLMs: (1) disproportionate allocation of attention to\nuninformative or trailing visual tokens, (2) over-dependence on the previously\ngenerated token, and (3) excessive fixation on system prompts that hinders\nmultimodal integration. To overcome these issues, VisFlow introduces a\ndual-level Attention Intervention, consisting of Token-level Attention\nIntervention (TAI), which reinforces attention to salient visual regions, and\nHead-level Attention Intervention (HAI), which suppresses undue focus on system\nprompts and adjacent text tokens. Together, these interventions strengthen\nvisual alignment while reducing linguistic bias.

These emerging AI\ncompanions raise critical questions: Can such systems fulfill social needs\ntypically met by human relationships? How do they shape psychological\nwell-being? And what new risks arise as users develop emotional ties to\nnon-human agents? This study investigates how people interact with AI\ncompanions, especially simulated partners on CharacterAI, and how this use is\nassociated with users' psychological well-being. We analyzed survey data from\n1,131 users and 4,363 chat sessions (413,509 messages) donated by 244\nparticipants, focusing on three dimensions of use: nature of the interaction,\ninteraction intensity, and self-disclosure. By triangulating self-reports\nprimary motivation, open-ended relationship descriptions, and annotated chat\ntranscripts, we identify patterns in how users engage with AI companions and\nits associations with well-being. Findings suggest that people with smaller\nsocial networks are more likely to turn to chatbots for companionship, but that\ncompanionship-oriented chatbot usage is consistently associated with lower\nwell-being, particularly when people use the chatbots more intensively, engage\nin higher levels of self-disclosure, and lack strong human social support. Even\nthough some people turn to chatbots to fulfill social needs, these uses of\nchatbots do not fully substitute for human connection. As a result, the\npsychological benefits may be limited, and the relationship could pose risks\nfor more socially isolated or emotionally vulnerable users.",

It has been proposed that some repeating FRBs may be produced by\ninteractions of the binary neutron star magnetospheres decades to centuries\nbefore the coalescence. These systems would also emit centi-Hertz gravitational\nwaves during this period, which can be detectable by space-borne gravitational\nwave detectors. We explore the prospects of using current and future\nspace-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as TianQin, LISA, and DECIGO, to\ntest this FRB formation hypothesis. Focusing on nearby galaxies like M81, which\nhosts a repeating FRB source in a globular cluster, we calculate the detection\ncapabilities for binary neutron star systems. Our analysis reveals that while\nmissions like TianQin and LISA face limitations in horizon distance, changing\ndetector pointing direction could significantly enhance detection\nprobabilities. Considering the chance of a Milky Way-like galaxy coincidentally\ncontaining a BNS within 100 years before merger is only $3\\times10^{-5}$ to\n$5\\times10^{-3}$, if a signal is detected originating from M81, we can\nestablish the link between FRB and binary neutron stars with a significance\nlevel of at least 2.81$\\sigma$, or a Bayes factor of $4\\times10^6 -\n7\\times10^8$ / $5\\times10^2 - 10^5$ against the background model with\noptimistic/realistic assumptions.

This question was first raised by Chattopadhyay, Goodman, Goyal\nand Li (STOC '20), motivated by applications in cryptography, distributed\ncomputing, and the unreliable nature of real-world sources of randomness. In\ntheir paper, they showed how to construct explicit low-error extractors for\njust $K \\geq N^{1/2}$ good sources of polylogarithmic min-entropy. In a\nfollow-up, Chattopadhyay and Goodman improved the number of good sources\nrequired to just $K \\geq N^{0.01}$ (FOCS '21). In this paper, we finally\nachieve $K=3$.\n  Our key ingredient is a near-optimal explicit construction of a new\npseudorandom primitive, called a leakage-resilient extractor (LRE) against\nnumber-on-forehead (NOF) protocols. Our LRE can be viewed as a significantly\nmore robust version of Li's low-error three-source extractor (FOCS '15), and\nresolves an open question put forth by Kumar, Meka, and Sahai (FOCS '19) and\nChattopadhyay, Goodman, Goyal, Kumar, Li, Meka, and Zuckerman (FOCS '20).

In this paper, we propose an\nestimator for robust and sparse linear regression that eliminates the need for\nexplicit prior knowledge of the noise scale. Our method builds on the Huber\nloss and incorporates an iterative scheme that alternates between coefficient\nestimation and adaptive noise calibration via median-of-means. The approach is\ntheoretically grounded and achieves sharp non-asymptotic error bounds under\nboth sub-Gaussian and heavy-tailed noise assumptions. Moreover, the proposed\nmethod accommodates arbitrary outlier contamination in the response without\nrequiring prior knowledge of the number of outliers or the sparsity level.\nWhile previous robust estimators avoid tuning parameters related to the noise\nscale or sparsity, our procedure achieves comparable error bounds when the\nnumber of outliers is unknown, and improved bounds when it is known. In\nparticular, the improved bounds match the known minimax lower bounds up to\nconstant factors.",

To address this challenge, we propose Second-Order\nState Hallucination (SOSH), a novel framework that detects compromised agents\nthrough distributed residual monitoring and maintains formation stability by\nreplacing attacked states with predictive second-order approximations. Unlike\nexisting mitigation strategies that require significant restructuring or induce\nlong transients, SOSH offers a lightweight, decentralized correction mechanism\nbased on second-order Taylor expansions, enabling rapid and scalable\nresilience. We establish rigorous Lyapunov-based stability guarantees, proving\nthat formation errors remain exponentially bounded even under persistent\nattacks, provided the hallucination parameters satisfy explicit conditions.\nComprehensive Monte Carlo experiments on a 5-agent complete graph formation\ndemonstrate that SOSH outperforms established robust control schemes, including\nW-MSR and Huber-based consensus filters, achieving faster convergence rates,\nlower steady-state error, and superior transient recovery.

However,\nthese large models typically process videos by averaging embedding outputs from\nmultiple clips over time to produce fixed-length representations. This approach\nfails to account for a variety of time-related features, such as variable video\ndurations, chronological order of events, and temporal variance in feature\nsignificance. While methods for temporal modeling do exist, they often require\nsignificant architectural changes and expensive retraining, making them\nimpractical for off-the-shelf, fine-tuned large encoders. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose DejaVid, an encoder-agnostic method that enhances model\nperformance without the need for retraining or altering the architecture. Our\nframework converts a video into a variable-length temporal sequence of\nembeddings, which we call a multivariate time series (MTS). An MTS naturally\npreserves temporal order and accommodates variable video durations. We then\nlearn per-timestep, per-feature weights over the encoded MTS frames, allowing\nus to account for variations in feature importance over time. We introduce a\nnew neural network architecture inspired by traditional time series alignment\nalgorithms for this learning task. Our evaluation demonstrates that DejaVid\nsubstantially improves the performance of a state-of-the-art large encoder,\nachieving leading Top-1 accuracy of 77.2% on Something-Something V2, 89.1% on\nKinetics-400, and 88.6% on HMDB51, while adding fewer than 1.8% additional\nlearnable parameters and requiring less than 3 hours of training time.

Specifically, the original problem\nis initially decomposed into two sub-problems of beamforming optimization and\nantenna position optimization through equivalent substitution. Then, the convex\napproximation methods are used to deal with the nonconvex constraints of\nsub-problems, and two sub-neural networks are constructed to calculate the\nsub-problems separately. Different from alternating optimization (AO), where\ntwo sub-problems are solved alternately and the solutions are influenced by the\ninitial values, two sub-neural networks of proposed GML-JO with fixed channel\ncoefficients are considered as local sub-tasks and the computation results are\nused to calculate the loss function of joint optimization. Finally, the\nparameters of sub-networks are updated using the average loss function over\ndifferent sub-tasks and the solution that is robust to the initial value is\nobtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GML-JO algorithm\nachieves 5.6 bits/s/Hz WSR within 100 iterations, yielding a 32.7\\% performance\nenhancement over conventional AO with substantially reduced computational\ncomplexity. Moreover, the proposed GML-JO algorithm is robust to different\nchoices of initialization and yields better performance compared with the\nexisting optimization methods.",

The use of onboard inertial sensors can also assist in the absence of\nGNSS, possibly in the presence of jammers. The combination of SOP and inertial\nsensors has received limited attention, yet it shows strong results on fully\ncustom-built platforms. We do not seek to improve such special-purpose schemes.\nRather, we focus on countering GNSS attacks, notably detecting them, with\nemphasis on deployment with consumer-grade platforms, notably smartphones, that\nprovide off-the-shelf opportunistic information (i.e., network position and\ninertial sensor data). Our Position-based Attack Detection Scheme (PADS) is a\nprobabilistic framework that uses regression and uncertainty analysis for\npositions. The regression optimization problem is a weighted mean square error\nof polynomial fitting, with constraints that the fitted positions satisfy the\ndevice velocity and acceleration. Then, uncertainty is modeled by a Gaussian\nprocess, which provides more flexibility to analyze how sure or unsure we are\nabout position estimations. In the detection process, we combine all\nuncertainty information with the position estimations into a fused test\nstatistic, which is the input utilized by an anomaly detector based on outlier\nensembles.

Current\nstreaming TTS paradigms often rely on multi-stage pipelines and discrete\nrepresentations, leading to increased computational cost and suboptimal system\nperformance. In this work, we propose StreamMel, a pioneering single-stage\nstreaming TTS framework that models continuous mel-spectrograms. By\ninterleaving text tokens with acoustic frames, StreamMel enables low-latency,\nautoregressive synthesis while preserving high speaker similarity and\nnaturalness. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate that StreamMel outperforms\nexisting streaming TTS baselines in both quality and latency. It even achieves\nperformance comparable to offline systems while supporting efficient real-time\ngeneration, showcasing broad prospects for integration with real-time speech\nlarge language models.

Ruling out feedback entirely,\nas often occurs in practice, is unattractive in many dynamic economic settings.\nWe provide a general characterization of all feedback and heterogeneity robust\n(FHR) moment conditions for nonlinear panel data models and present\nconstructive methods to derive feasible moment-based estimators for specific\nmodels. We also use our moment characterization to compute semiparametric\nefficiency bounds, allowing for a quantification of the information loss\nassociated with accommodating feedback, as well as providing insight into how\nto construct estimators with good efficiency properties in practice. Our\nresults apply both to the finite dimensional parameter indexing the parametric\npart of the model as well as to estimands that involve averages over the\ndistribution of unobserved heterogeneity.

    "abstract": "The concept bottleneck model (CBM), as a technique improving interpretability\nvia linking predictions to human-understandable concepts, makes high-risk and\nlife-critical medical image classification credible. Typically, existing CBM\nmethods associate the final layer of visual encoders with concepts to explain\nthe model's predictions. However, we empirically discover the phenomenon of\nconcept preference variation, that is, the concepts are preferably associated\nwith the features at different layers than those only at the final layer; yet a\nblind last-layer-based association neglects such a preference variation and\nthus weakens the accurate correspondences between features and concepts,\nimpairing model interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nMulti-layer Visual Preference-enhanced Concept Bottleneck Model (MVP-CBM),\nwhich comprises two key novel modules: (1) intra-layer concept preference\nmodeling, which captures the preferred association of different concepts with\nfeatures at various visual layers, and (2) multi-layer concept sparse\nactivation fusion, which sparsely aggregates concept activations from multiple\nlayers to enhance performance. Thus, by explicitly modeling concept\npreferences, MVP-CBM can comprehensively leverage multi-layer visual\ninformation to provide a more nuanced and accurate explanation of model\ndecisions. Extensive experiments on several public medical classification\nbenchmarks demonstrate that MVP-CBM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and\ninteroperability, verifying its superiority.

Features and capabilities of\nneuromorphic dendrites are demonstrated via a benchmark drawn from experimental\nneuroscience: spike sorting. Spike sorting takes inputs from electrical probes\nimplanted in neural tissue, detects voltage spikes (action potentials) emitted\nby neurons, and attempts to sort the spikes according to the neuron that\nemitted them. Many spike sorting methods form clusters based on the shapes of\naction potential waveforms, under the assumption that spikes emitted by a given\nneuron have similar shapes and will therefore map to the same cluster. Using a\nstream of synthetic spike shapes, the accuracy of the proposed dendrite is\ncompared with the more compute-intensive, offline k-means clustering approach.\nOverall, the dendrite outperforms k-means and has the advantage of requiring\nonly a single pass through the input stream, learning as it goes. The\ncapabilities of the neuromorphic dendrite are demonstrated for a number of\nscenarios including dynamic changes in the input stream, differing neuron spike\nrates, and varying neuron counts.",

Many DP mechanisms are built upon one of two underlying tools: Laplace\nand Gaussian additive noise mechanisms.

The Laplace and Gaussian\nmechanisms are special cases of GG for $\\beta=1$ and $\\beta=2$, respectively.\n  In this work, we prove that all members of the GG family satisfy differential\nprivacy, and provide an extension of an existing numerical accountant (the PRV\naccountant) for these mechanisms. We show that privacy accounting for the GG\nMechanism and its variants is dimension independent, which substantially\nimproves computational costs of privacy accounting.\n  We apply the GG mechanism to two canonical tools for private machine\nlearning, PATE and DP-SGD; we show empirically that $\\beta$ has a weak\nrelationship with test-accuracy, and that generally $\\beta=2$ (Gaussian) is\nnearly optimal.

This shift in perspective can provide new insights, even in\ntheories for which the Renormalization Group flow of individual couplings is\nwell understood. As a first application, we propagate errors under the\nRenormalization Group flow. Characteristic properties of an error distribution,\nsuch as its maximum or highest density region, cannot be propagated at the\nlevel of individual couplings, but require our evolution equation for the\ndistribution on the space of couplings. We demonstrate this by calculating the\nmost probable value for the metastability scale in the Higgs sector of the\nStandard Model. Our second application is the emergence of structure in sets of\ncouplings. We discover that infrared-attractive fixed points do not necessarily\nattract the maximum of the distribution when the Renormalization Group is\nevolved over a finite range of scales. Instead, sharply peaked maxima can build\nup at coupling values that cannot be inferred from individual trajectories. We\ndemonstrate this emergence of structure for the Standard Model, starting from a\nbroad distribution at the Planck scale. The Renormalization Group flow favors\nthe phenomenological ordering of third-generation Yukawa couplings and,\nstrikingly, we find that the most probable values for the Abelian hypercharge\nand Higgs quartic coupling lie close to their observed values.",

The causes of these creep\nepisodes and their link to potential catastrophic failure remain poorly\nunderstood. Here, we present a novel 'endo-exo' framework for analyzing\nepisodic rock creep in deep underground mines, capturing the interplay between\nexogenous triggers (e.g., blasting and excavation) and endogenous processes\n(e.g., damage and healing within rock masses). The underlying physical\nmechanism involves cascades of locally triggered rock block movements due to\nfracturing and sliding. We identify four fundamental types of episodic\ndynamics, classified by the origin of disturbance (endogenous or exogenous) and\nthe level of criticality (subcritical or critical). All four types exhibit\npower law relaxations with distinct exponents: 1+\\theta (exogenous\nsubcritical), 1-\\theta (exogenous critical), 1-2\\theta (endogenous critical)\nand 0 (endogenous subcritical), all governed by a single parameter 0 < \\theta <\n1. Our theoretical predictions are examined using the comprehensive dataset of\na platinum mine in South Africa, where stopes display episodic closure behavior\nduring successive mining operations. All creep episodes recorded can be\naccounted for in our classification with \\theta \\approx 0.35\\pm0.1, providing\nstrong validation of our theory.

CDFD\nseparates flow into two components: a circular (divergence-free) component and\nan acyclic component that carries all nett directional flow. This yields a\nnormalized circularity index between 0 (fully acyclic) and 1 (for networks\nformed solely by the superposition of cycles), with the complement measuring\ndirectionality. This index captures the proportion of flow involved in cycles,\nand admits a range of interpretations - such as system closure, feedback,\nweighted strong connectivity, structural redundancy, or inefficiency. Although\nthe decomposition is generally non-unique, we show that the set of all\ndecompositions forms a well-structured geometric space with favourable\ntopological properties. Within this space, we highlight two benchmark\ndecompositions aligned with distinct analytical goals: the maximum circularity\nsolution, which minimizes nett flow, and the Balanced Flow Forwarding (BFF)\nsolution, a unique, locally computable decomposition that distributes circular\nflow across all feasible cycles in proportion to the original network\nstructure. We demonstrate the interpretive value and computational tractability\nof both decompositions on synthetic and empirical networks. They outperform\nexisting circularity metrics in detecting meaningful structural variation. The\ndecomposition also enables structural analysis - such as mapping the\ndistribution of cyclic flow - and supports practical applications that require\nexplicit flow allocation or routing, including multilateral netting and\nefficient transport.",

We begin by outlining the historical development of IMDs and the\nregulatory milestones that have shaped their oversight. Next, we summarize\nsimilarities between IMDs and emerging implantable BCIs, identifying existing\nprovisions for their regulation. We then use two case studies of emerging\ncutting-edge BCIs, the HALO and SCALO computer systems, to highlight\ndistinctive features in the design and application of next-generation BCIs\narising from contemporary chip architectures, which necessitate reevaluating\nregulatory approaches. We identify critical ethical considerations for these\nBCIs, including unique conceptions of autonomy, identity, and mental privacy.\nBased on these insights, we suggest potential avenues for the ethical\nregulation of BCIs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary\ncollaboration and proactive mitigation of potential harms. The goal is to\nsupport the responsible design and application of new BCIs, ensuring their safe\nand ethical integration into medical practice.",

In the second type ones, composite fermions in the topmost\neffective levels of the two layers form exciton condensate whereas those in\nlower effective levels are independent.

When the incident electron energy is below the first ionization\npotential of the molecule, dissociative electron attachment (DEA) process\ndominates, primarily yielding O$^-$ and S$^-$ fragments.

While DETR-like architectures offer a\npowerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent\nlimitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these\nchallenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally\nadvance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.\nFirst, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the\nintegration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves\nthe stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization\nobjective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to\naddress the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which\nseverely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly\nintroduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and\nunlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated\nself-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to\nsynergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the\niterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that\nMonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular\nbenchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components\nseamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant\nperformance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes\ndataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing integration of smart meters in electrical grids\nworldwide, detecting energy theft has become a critical and ongoing challenge.\nArtificial intelligence (AI)-based models have demonstrated strong performance\nin identifying fraudulent consumption patterns; however, previous works\nexploring the use of machine learning solutions for this problem demand high\ncomputational and energy costs, limiting their practicality -- particularly in\nlow-theft scenarios where continuous inference can result in unnecessary energy\nusage. This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism,\ndesigned to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed\nto the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve\nenergy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing\nenergy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed\nsystem was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying\ntheft severity and number of active thieves.

These findings support the feasibility of a more\nenergy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart\ngrids.

The exact expressions for thermodynamic characteristics,\nincluding the ground state characteristics, were obtained. We considered a\nnumber of modeling chains with different signs and absolute values of exchange\nconstants for the nearest- and the next-nearest neighbors. For these models we\ncalculated the magnetization curves. The critical values of magnetic fields and\ncorresponding magnetization plateau parameters were obtained. Analytic\nexpressions for the ground state entropy were obtained for the chains with\ndifferent interaction constants. The dependencies of the number of states with\nminimum energy (the degeneration of the ground state) as the function of the\nnumber of particles were found. It was shown that these dependencies are\nexpressed in terms of well-known numerical sequences - Lucas numbers and Pell\nnumbers, which, in the limit of a large number of particles, are proportional\nto the powers of the golden and silver sections. Therefore, the ground state\nentropy (per particle) of the systems under consideration can be described in\nterms of these sections and, therefore, is nonzero.",

This elusive phenomenon\nhas attracted a lot of interest and has been widely studied, revealing several\ntypes of chimeras. Most cases involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each\noscillator exerts and receives the same interaction, modeled via networks.\nHowever, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body)\ninteractions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more\nelusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier\nto be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In\nthis work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal\nhigher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not\nonly the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite\nthe non-reciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of\nthe directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the one\nresulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms\nthat the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order\ninteractions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through\nphase reduction theory.",

This study\npresents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning\nmodels for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over\n3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was\ncurated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation\nand normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The\nmodels were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to\nreduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in\naccuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms,\nincluding smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as\ninference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet\nachieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time\nperformance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU.\nShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in\nresource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices.

Students with more experience of\nusing large language models were even more likely to be influenced by the\nrobot's stance -- in particular for the two easiest questions on which the\nrobot was wrong -- suggesting that familiarity with AI can increase\nsusceptibility to misinformation by AI.\n  We further examined how three different levels of portrayed robot certainty,\ndisplayed using semantics, prosody and facial signals, affected how the\nstudents aligned with the robot's answer on specific questions and how\nconvincing they perceived the robot to be on these questions. The students\naligned with the robot's answers in 94.4% of the cases when the robot was\nportrayed as Certain, 82.6% when it was Neutral and 71.4% when it was\nUncertain. The alignment was thus high for all conditions, highlighting\nstudents' general susceptibility to accept the robot's stance, but alignment in\nthe Uncertain condition was significantly lower than in the Certain. Post-test\nquestionnaire answers further show that students found the robot most\nconvincing when it was portrayed as Certain.

Given the hybrid fermion-boson nature of polaritonic\nproblem, one may legitimately ask: should we rely exclusively on conventional\nqubit-based platforms, or consider alternative computational paradigms?

For each platform, we design\ncompact, physically motivated quantum circuit ans\\\"{a}tze and integrate them\nwithin the state-averaged variational quantum eigensolver to compute multiple\npolaritonic eigenstates simultaneously. A key element of our approach is the\ndevelopment of compact electron-photon entangling circuits, tailored to the\nnative capabilities and limitations of each hardware architecture. We benchmark\nall three strategies on a cavity-embedded H$_{2}$ molecule, reproducing\ncharacteristic phenomena such as light-induced avoided crossings. Our results\nshow that each platform achieves comparable accuracy in predicting polaritonic\neigen-energies and eigenstates.

    "abstract": "Obtaining high-quality speaker embeddings in multi-speaker conditions is\ncrucial for many applications. A recently proposed guided speaker embedding\nframework, which utilizes speech activities of target and non-target speakers\nas clues, drastically improved embeddings under severe overlap with small\ndegradation in low-overlap cases. However, since extreme overlaps are rare in\nnatural conversations, this degradation cannot be overlooked. This paper first\nreveals that the degradation is caused by the global-statistics-based modules,\nwidely used in speaker embedding extractors, being overly sensitive to\nintervals containing only non-target speakers. As a countermeasure, we propose\nan extension of such modules that exploit the target speaker activity clues, to\ncompute statistics from intervals where the target is active. The proposed\nmethod improves speaker verification performance in both low and high overlap\nratios, and diarization performance on multiple datasets.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid modelling enhances the accuracy and predictive capability of dynamic\nmodels by integrating first principles with data-driven methods, effectively\nmitigating epistemic uncertainties inherent in mechanistic approaches. However,\nhybrid model construction remains complex, typically requiring expert knowledge\nto identify model epistemic uncertainty and select suitable machine-learning\ncomponents to capture it. This complexity limits broader adoption in research\nand industry. We introduce SINDybrid, an automated algorithm designed to\nstreamline hybrid model development for dynamic systems. SINDybrid employs a\nmixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach to systematically identify\nepistemic uncertainty sources and compensate them using optimally selected\ndata-driven components. For broader accessibility and reproducibility, we\nprovide SINDybrid as an open-source Python library. SINDybrid was validated\nthrough three case studies: a catalytic reaction system, a continuous\nfermentation process, and a Lotka-Volterra oscillator, each showcasing\ndifferent epistemic uncertainties. The robustness of the algorithm is tested\nagainst varying experimental conditions, including measurement noise (up to\n20%), limited training batches (minimum 2), and sparse temporal sampling\n(minimum 5 samples per experiment). Results demonstrate a consistent ability of\nthe SINDybrid approach to produce accurate hybrid models, achieving R^2 scores\nabove 0.85 on validation data. Additionally, the algorithm effectively\nidentifies uncertainty locations within system dynamics under challenging\nscenarios. This work highlights SINDybrid potential as a versatile, automated\nsolution for hybrid modelling, significantly reducing the barriers to adopting\nhybrid methods in complex dynamic systems across scientific research and\nindustrial applications.",

To this end,\nwe simulate the time evolution of two interacting electrons on a finite-size\nchain governed by an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian including on-site Coulomb\nrepulsion $ U $ and nearest-neighbor interaction $V$, along with\nsingle-electron hopping $J$. By introducing a local site energy defect with\namplitude $ \\Delta $, we show that a transition between spatially\npaired/dissociated electrons can occur in the vicinity of this site. Such\nmechanisms arise in a strongly correlated regime with non-zero nearest neighbor\nCoulomb interactions and under the conditions $ (U \\sim V \\sim \\Delta) \\gg J$.\nTo rationalize these phenomena, we reformulate the two-electron dynamics of the\noriginal Hubbard chain as an effective single-particle problem on a\ntwo-dimensional network. Within this framework, we show that the\npairing/dissociation dynamics are driven by resonances between two distinct\nfamilies of two-electron eigenstates: $(i)$ states with two spatially\nwell-separated electrons with one located at the site defect, and $(ii)$ states\nwith locally bound electron located away from the defect. At resonance, these\nstates hybridize, allowing transitions from locally paired to dissociated\nelectrons (and vice versa) in the vicinity of the defect.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are prone to three types of hallucination:\nInput-Conflicting, Context-Conflicting and Fact-Conflicting hallucinations. The\npurpose of this study is to mitigate the different types of hallucination by\nexploiting the interdependence between them. For this purpose, we propose a\nMulti-Information Adapter for Large Language Models (MALM). This framework\nemploys a tailored multi-graph learning approach designed to elucidate the\ninterconnections between original inputs, contextual information, and external\nfactual knowledge, thereby alleviating the three categories of hallucination\nwithin a cohesive framework. Experiments were carried out on four benchmarking\ndatasets: HaluEval, TruthfulQA, Natural Questions, and TriviaQA. We evaluated\nthe proposed framework in two aspects: (1) adaptability to different base LLMs\non HaluEval and TruthfulQA, to confirm if MALM is effective when applied on 7\ntypical LLMs. MALM showed significant improvements over LLaMA-2; (2)\ngeneralizability to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by combining MALM with\nthree representative retrievers (BM25, Spider and DPR) separately. Furthermore,\nautomated and human evaluations were conducted to substantiate the correctness\nof experimental results, where GPT-4 and 3 human volunteers judged which\nresponse was better between LLaMA-2 and MALM. The results showed that both\nGPT-4 and human preferred MALM in 79.4% and 65.6% of cases respectively. The\nresults validate that incorporating the complex interactions between the three\ntypes of hallucination through a multilayered graph attention network into the\nLLM generation process is effective to mitigate the them. The adapter design of\nthe proposed approach is also proven flexible and robust across different base\nLLMs.",

To address this, we propose Tiered\nAgentic Oversight (TAO), a hierarchical multi-agent framework that enhances AI\nsafety through layered, automated supervision. Inspired by clinical hierarchies\n(e.g., nurse, physician, specialist), TAO conducts agent routing based on task\ncomplexity and agent roles. Leveraging automated inter- and intra-tier\ncollaboration and role-playing, TAO creates a robust safety framework. Ablation\nstudies reveal that TAO's superior performance is driven by its adaptive tiered\narchitecture, which improves safety by over 3.2% compared to static single-tier\nconfigurations; the critical role of its lower tiers, particularly tier 1,\nwhose removal most significantly impacts safety; and the strategic assignment\nof more advanced LLM to these initial tiers, which boosts performance by over\n2% compared to less optimal allocations while achieving near-peak safety\nefficiently. These mechanisms enable TAO to outperform single-agent and\nmulti-agent frameworks in 4 out of 5 healthcare safety benchmarks, showing up\nto an 8.2% improvement over the next-best methods in these evaluations.\nFinally, we validate TAO via an auxiliary clinician-in-the-loop study where\nintegrating expert feedback improved TAO's accuracy in medical triage from 40%\nto 60%.",

While most existing TTA methods for video primarily utilize visual\nsupervisory signals, they often overlook the potential contribution of inherent\naudio data. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that incorporates\naudio information into video TTA. Our method capitalizes on the rich semantic\ncontent of audio to generate audio-assisted pseudo-labels, a new concept in the\ncontext of video TTA. Specifically, we propose an audio-to-video label mapping\nmethod by first employing pre-trained audio models to classify audio signals\nextracted from videos and then mapping the audio-based predictions to video\nlabel spaces through large language models, thereby establishing a connection\nbetween the audio categories and video labels. To effectively leverage the\ngenerated pseudo-labels, we present a flexible adaptation cycle that determines\nthe optimal number of adaptation iterations for each sample, based on changes\nin loss and consistency across different views. This enables a customized\nadaptation process for each sample. Experimental results on two widely used\ndatasets (UCF101-C and Kinetics-Sounds-C), as well as on two newly constructed\naudio-video TTA datasets (AVE-C and AVMIT-C) with various corruption types,\ndemonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to\na series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling\neffective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource\nconstraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based\nintelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow.

    "abstract": "Implicit neural representation (INR), particularly in combination with hash\nencoding, has recently emerged as a promising approach for computed tomography\n(CT) image reconstruction. However, directly applying INR techniques to 3D\ndental cone-beam CT (CBCT) with a truncated field of view (FOV) is challenging.\nDuring the training process, if the FOV does not fully encompass the patient's\nhead, a discrepancy arises between the measured projections and the forward\nprojections computed within the truncated domain. This mismatch leads the\nnetwork to estimate attenuation values inaccurately, producing severe artifacts\nin the reconstructed images. In this study, we propose a computationally\nefficient INR-based reconstruction framework that leverages multi-resolution\nhash encoding for 3D dental CBCT with a truncated FOV. To mitigate truncation\nartifacts, we train the network over an expanded reconstruction domain that\nfully encompasses the patient's head. For computational efficiency, we adopt an\nadaptive training strategy that uses a multi-resolution grid: finer resolution\nlevels and denser sampling inside the truncated FOV, and coarser resolution\nlevels with sparser sampling outside. To maintain consistent input\ndimensionality of the network across spatially varying resolutions, we\nintroduce an adaptive hash encoder that selectively activates the lower-level\nfeatures of the hash hierarchy for points outside the truncated FOV. The\nproposed method with an extended FOV effectively mitigates truncation\nartifacts. Compared with a naive domain extension using fixed resolution levels\nand a fixed sampling rate, the adaptive strategy reduces computational time by\nover 60% for an image volume of 800x800x600, while preserving the PSNR within\nthe truncated FOV.",

    "abstract": "This study systematically investigates the impact of natural radioactive\nbackground on the dark count rate (DCR) of 20-inch microchannel plate\nphotomultiplier tubes (MCP-PMTs). Variations in PMT DCR under different\nradiation conditions were examined via underground tests, lead shielding\nexperiments, and irradiation with \\(^{55}\\mathrm{Fe}\\), \\(^{60}\\mathrm{Co}\\),\nand \\(^{90}\\mathrm{Sr}\\) sources. The experimental results indicate that\nnatural radioactivity from surrounding air and rock in the underground\nenvironment results in a significantly higher DCR compared to laboratory\nconditions. Further, lead shielding experiments confirmed that effective\nshielding can markedly reduce the interference from environmental background\nradiation. Notably, $\\beta$ particles from the \\(^{90}\\mathrm{Sr}\\) source\nincreased the DCR by approximately 14 kHz, whereas the effects of\n$\\mathrm{X}$-rays from \\(^{55}\\mathrm{Fe}\\) and $\\gamma$-rays from\n\\(^{60}\\mathrm{Co}\\) were comparatively minor. In addition, Geant4 simulations\nprovided quantitative analysis of Cherenkov radiation induced by $\\beta$\nparticles, with the simulation results closely matching the experimental data\nand confirming $\\beta$ particles as the primary contributor to the DCR\nincrease. These findings offer both theoretical and experimental evidence for a\ndeeper understanding of the influence of radioactive background on 20-inch\nMCP-PMTs' performance in underground experiments and hold significant\nimplications for improving the energy resolution of large-scale neutrino\ndetection systems",

How can agent developers\ncalibrate the appropriate levels of autonomy at which their agents should\noperate? We argue that an agent's level of autonomy can be treated as a\ndeliberate design decision, separate from its capability and operational\nenvironment. In this work, we define five levels of escalating agent autonomy,\ncharacterized by the roles a user can take when interacting with an agent:\noperator, collaborator, consultant, approver, and observer. Within each level,\nwe describe the ways by which a user can exert control over the agent and open\nquestions for how to design the nature of user-agent interaction. We then\nhighlight a potential application of our framework towards AI autonomy\ncertificates to govern agent behavior in single- and multi-agent systems.

Second, we\ninvestigate HOTIs with various polygonal geometries and find that the presence\nand location of corner modes depend sensitively on the shape. In particular, a\ncorner hosts a localized mode if the Dirac masses of its two adjacent edges\nhave opposite signs, while no corner mode emerges if the masses share the same\nsign.

    "abstract": "We present a covariant scalar-field framework that unifies the space-time\nsingularity resolution with dynamic dark energy. The theory extends general\nrelativity by introducing a scalar field $\\Phi$ whose potential couples to the\nLorentz-invariant quantity $X \\equiv u_{\\alpha} u_{\\beta}\nT^{\\alpha\\beta}_{\\mathrm{matter}}$, ensuring manifest covariance. The resulting\ndensity-responsive scalar energy $\\rho_\\Phi$ exhibits dual behavior: (i) in\nhigh-density regimes, it saturates at $\\rho_\\Phi \\leq AM_P^4/2$, providing a\nPlanck-scale upper bound on the total energy density that regularizes classical\nsingularities; (ii) in low-density regimes, it approaches a constant $\\rho_\\Phi\n\\to AM_U^4$, driving cosmic acceleration as dynamical dark energy. A natural\nrenormalization group evolution with an anomalous dimension $\\gamma \\approx\n0.501$ connects the Planck scale to the meV dark energy scale without\nfine-tuning. The model makes distinctive, testable predictions: $w_0 \\approx\n-0.99$ and $w_a \\approx +0.03$, where the positive $w_a$ distinguishes it from\n$\\Lambda$CDM and standard quintessence models. Despite the novel interaction\nterms, the fifth forces are suppressed by $\\beta_{\\rm eff} \\propto 1/\\rho_m^2$,\nyielding factors below $10^{-58}$ in laboratory environments, and ensuring\ncompatibility with all precision gravity tests. This framework demonstrates how\na single quantum field theory mechanism can simultaneously address UV\nsingularities and IR dark energy, providing concrete predictions for future\nStage-IV cosmological surveys.",

To\nthis end, in this paper, we propose Multi-View Representation Learning\n(Merlin), which can help existing models achieve semantic alignment between\nincomplete observations with different missing rates and complete observations\nin MTS. Specifically, Merlin consists of two key modules: offline knowledge\ndistillation and multi-view contrastive learning.

The\nlatter improves the student model's robustness by learning from\npositive/negative data pairs constructed from incomplete observations with\ndifferent missing rates, ensuring semantic alignment across different missing\nrates.

    "abstract": "Link prediction in multilayer networks is a key challenge in applications\nsuch as recommendation systems and protein-protein interaction prediction.\nWhile many techniques have been developed, most rely on assumptions about\nshared structures and require access to raw auxiliary data, limiting their\npracticality. To address these issues, we propose a novel transfer learning\nframework for multilayer networks using a bi-level model averaging method. A\n$K$-fold cross-validation criterion based on edges is used to automatically\nweight inter-layer and intra-layer candidate models. This enables the transfer\nof information from auxiliary layers while mitigating model uncertainty, even\nwithout prior knowledge of shared structures. Theoretically, we prove the\noptimality and weight convergence of our method under mild conditions.\nComputationally, our framework is efficient and privacy-preserving, as it\navoids raw data sharing and supports parallel processing across multiple\nservers. Simulations show our method outperforms others in predictive accuracy\nand robustness. We further demonstrate its practical value through two\nreal-world recommendation system applications.",

Although Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms have shown potential in optimizing TSC\nthrough real-time decision-making, their scalability and effectiveness often\nsuffer from large-scale and complex environments. Typically, these limitations\nprimarily stem from a fundamental mismatch between the exponential growth of\nthe state space driven by the environmental heterogeneities and the limited\nmodeling capacity of current solutions. To address these issues, this paper\nintroduces a novel MARL framework that integrates Dynamic Graph Neural Networks\n(DGNNs) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), aiming to enhance the\nexpressiveness of environmental representations and improve agent coordination.\nFurthermore, inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), a topology-assisted spatial pattern disentangling\n(TSD)-enhanced MoE is proposed, which leverages topological signatures to\ndecouple graph features for specialized processing, thus improving the model's\nability to characterize dynamic and heterogeneous local observations. The TSD\nmodule is also integrated into the policy and value networks of the Multi-agent\nProximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, further improving\ndecision-making efficiency and robustness.

To address this gap, this paper\nproposes a Sentiment-aware-SDP-Enhanced-Module (SSDP-SEM), a multi-task\nlearning approach for enhancing financial RE. Specifically, SSDP-SEM integrates\nthe RE models with a pluggable auxiliary sentiment perception (ASP) task,\nenabling the RE models to concurrently navigate their attention weights with\nthe text's sentiment. We first generate detailed sentiment tokens through a\nsentiment model and insert these tokens into an instance. Then, the ASP task\nfocuses on capturing nuanced sentiment information through predicting the\nsentiment token positions, combining both sentiment insights and the Shortest\nDependency Path (SDP) of syntactic information. Moreover, this work employs a\nsentiment attention information bottleneck regularization method to regulate\nthe reasoning process. Our experiment integrates this auxiliary task with\nseveral prevalent frameworks, and the results demonstrate that most previous\nmodels benefit from the auxiliary task, thereby achieving better results.

Yet, current CRL methods\nfail in reconciling their principled latent representations with known\nbiological processes, leading to models that are not interpretable. To address\nthis major issue, we present SENA-discrepancy-VAE, a model based on the\nrecently proposed CRL method discrepancy-VAE, that produces representations\nwhere each latent factor can be interpreted as the (linear) combination of the\nactivity of a (learned) set of biological processes. To this extent, we present\nan encoder, SENA-{\\delta}, that efficiently compute and map biological\nprocesses' activity levels to the latent causal factors. We show that\nSENA-discrepancy-VAE achieves predictive performances on unseen combinations of\ninterventions that are comparable with its original, non-interpretable\ncounterpart, while inferring causal latent factors that are biologically\nmeaningful.",

Bringing together\nthe voices of early-career researchers from multiple fields, it explores how AI\nsystems that simulate or interpret human emotions are reshaping our\ninteractions in areas such as education, healthcare, mental health, caregiving,\nand digital life. The analysis is structured around four central themes: the\nethical implications of emotional AI, the cultural dynamics of human-machine\ninteraction, the risks and opportunities for vulnerable populations, and the\nemerging regulatory, design, and technical considerations. The authors\nhighlight the potential of affective AI to support mental well-being, enhance\nlearning, and reduce loneliness, as well as the risks of emotional\nmanipulation, over-reliance, misrepresentation, and cultural bias. Key\nchallenges include simulating empathy without genuine understanding, encoding\ndominant sociocultural norms into AI systems, and insufficient safeguards for\nindividuals in sensitive or high-risk contexts. Special attention is given to\nchildren, elderly users, and individuals with mental health challenges, who may\ninteract with AI in emotionally significant ways. However, there remains a lack\nof cognitive or legal protections which are necessary to navigate such\nengagements safely. The report concludes with ten recommendations, including\nthe need for transparency, certification frameworks, region-specific\nfine-tuning, human oversight, and longitudinal research.

Specifically, we present a deterministic lifting theorem that translates\none-way two-party communication lower bounds into one-way NOF lower bounds.\n  Our lifting theorem yields two applications. First, we obtain an optimal\nexplicit separation between randomized and deterministic one-way NOF\ncommunication, even in the multi-player setting. This improves the prior\nsquare-root vs. constant separation for three players established by Kelley and\nLyu (arXiv 2025). Second, we achieve optimal separations between one-round and\ntwo-round deterministic NOF communication, improving upon the previous\nseparation of $\\Omega(\\frac{n^{1/(k-1)}}{k^k})$ vs. $O(\\log n)$ for $k$\nplayers, as shown by Viola and Wigderson (FOCS 2007).\n  Beyond the lifting theorems, we also apply our techniques to the disjointness\nproblem.

Attackers can implant latent triggers\nthat persist through downstream tasks, enabling malicious control of model\nbehavior upon trigger presentation. Despite great success in recent defense\nmechanisms, they remain impractical due to strong assumptions about attacker\nknowledge or excessive clean data requirements. In this paper, we introduce\nInverTune, the first backdoor defense framework for multimodal models under\nminimal attacker assumptions, requiring neither prior knowledge of attack\ntargets nor access to the poisoned dataset. Unlike existing defense methods\nthat rely on the same dataset used in the poisoning stage, InverTune\neffectively identifies and removes backdoor artifacts through three key\ncomponents, achieving robust protection against backdoor attacks. Specifically,\nInverTune first exposes attack signatures through adversarial simulation,\nprobabilistically identifying the target label by analyzing model response\npatterns. Building on this, we develop a gradient inversion technique to\nreconstruct latent triggers through activation pattern analysis. Finally, a\nclustering-guided fine-tuning strategy is employed to erase the backdoor\nfunction with only a small amount of arbitrary clean data, while preserving the\noriginal model capabilities. Experimental results show that InverTune reduces\nthe average attack success rate (ASR) by 97.87% against the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) attacks while limiting clean accuracy (CA) degradation to just 3.07%.\nThis work establishes a new paradigm for securing multimodal systems, advancing\nsecurity in foundation model deployment without compromising performance.",

First, for class imbalance perception, we map\nmulti-view features into a consensus space and reformulate the imbalanced\nclustering as a partial optimal transport (POT) problem, augmented with\nprogressive mass constraints and weighted KL divergence for class\ndistributions. Second, we develop a POT-enhanced class-rebalanced contrastive\nlearning at both feature and class levels, incorporating logit adjustment and\nclass-sensitive learning to enhance minority sample representations. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that PROTOCOL significantly improves clustering\nperformance on imbalanced multi-view data, filling a critical research gap in\nthis field.",

The synthetic harmonic tones found in the musical sequences under\nstudy were observed to transmit more perceived pitches than their acoustic\ncounterparts, with significant variation across listeners.

To bridge\nthis gap, we propose EXGnet, a novel and reliable ECG arrhythmia classification\nnetwork tailored for single-lead signals, specifically designed to balance high\naccuracy, explainability, and edge compatibility. EXGnet integrates XAI\nsupervision during training via a normalized cross-correlation based loss,\ndirecting the model's attention to clinically relevant ECG regions, similar to\na cardiologist's focus. This supervision is driven by automatically generated\nground truth, derived through an innovative heart rate variability-based\napproach, without the need for manual annotation. To enhance classification\naccuracy without compromising deployment simplicity, we incorporate\nquantitative ECG features during training. These enrich the model with\nmulti-domain knowledge but are excluded during inference, keeping the model\nlightweight for edge deployment. Additionally, we introduce an innovative\nmultiresolution block to efficiently capture both short and long-term signal\nfeatures while maintaining computational efficiency. Rigorous evaluation on the\nChapman and Ningbo benchmark datasets validates the supremacy of EXGnet, which\nachieves average five-fold accuracies of 98.762% and 96.932%, and F1-scores of\n97.910% and 95.527%, respectively.

To address this issue, we propose a local-global feature complementation\nnetwork (LGCN) for VPR which integrates a parallel CNN-ViT hybrid architecture\nwith a dynamic feature fusion module (DFM).

Specifically, LARGO incorporates parallel trainable\ngradient projections to dynamically regulate layer-wise updates, retaining the\nOut-Of-Distribution robustness of pretrained model while preserving inter-layer\nindependence. Additionally, it ensures computational efficiency by mitigating\nthe influence of gradient dependencies across layers during weight updates.\nBesides, through leveraging singular value decomposition of pretrained weights\nfor structured initialization, we incorporate an SVD-based initialization\nstrategy that minimizing deviation from pretrained knowledge. Through extensive\nexperiments on diverse benchmarks, LARGO achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios, demonstrating improved\nrobustness under domain shifts with significantly lower computational overhead\ncompared to existing PEFT methods. The source code will be released soon.",

This paper introduces new measures to\ncomplement the ROCOF, providing a more comprehensive understanding of system\nreliability, particularly for Markov systems. We define the Rate of Occurrence\nof Repairs (ROCOR), which quantifies the system's instantaneous tendency to\ntransition from failure to working states, and the Rate of Inoccurrence (ROI),\nwhich measures the propensity to remain within the current subset of states\n(either working or failure) without transitioning out.

    "abstract": "The band-degeneracy points in the Brillouin zones of chiral crystals exist in\nmultiple avatars, with the high-symmetry points being able to host multifold\nnodes of distinct characters. A class of such crystals, assisted by the\nspin-orbit coupling, harbours fourfold degeneracy in the form of\nRarita-Schwinger-Weyl node (RSWN) at the $\\Gamma$-point. Our aim is to explore\nthe nature of longitudinal magnetoconductivity, arising from applying collinear\nelectric and magnetic fields, for such systems. Adjusting the chemical\npotential to lie near the intrinsic energy-location of the RSWN, the multifold\nnature of the RSWN is revealed by an interplay of intraband and interband\nscatterings, which would not arise in twofold degeneracies like the\nconventional Weyl nodes. The current study fills up the much-needed gap in\nobtaining the linear response from an exact computation, rather than the\ninsufficient relaxation-time approximation employed earlier.",

Of central interest is why the superionic conductors exhibit such\nlow thermal conductivity, and competing mechanisms have been proposed thus far.\nIn this study, we investigate the effects of Cu and Au substitution for Ag site\non the crystal structure and thermal properties of AgCrSe$_2$, which exhibits\nsuperionic conduction of Ag ions. We show that Au substitution significantly\nreduces the lattice thermal conductivity of AgCrSe$_2$. Powder structure\nanalysis using synchrotron x-ray diffraction reveals that Au substitution\nincreases the anisotropic atomic displacement parameter of Ag ions along the\n$a$ and $b$ axes. This result indicates that the amplitude of in-plane\nvibrations is enhanced, which is attributed to increased anharmonicity in the\npotential energy around Ag ions. The enhanced vibrational amplitude also\nsuggests a reduction in the force constants between Ag ions. Consequently, the\nenhanced anharmonicity not only shortens the phonon lifetime ($\\tau$) by\nincreasing phonon-phonon scattering, but also increases the number of\nlow-energy phonons, which further contributes to the reduction of $\\tau$. This\nanharmonicity mechanism is applicable to other superionic conductors exhibiting\nultra-low thermal conductivity, promoting their widespread use as\nthermoelectric materials.",

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents often exhibit intricate failure\nmodes that are difficult to understand, debug, and learn from. This opacity\nhinders their reliable deployment in real-world applications. To address this\ncritical gap, we introduce ``Ghost Policies,'' a concept materialized through\nArvolution, a novel Augmented Reality (AR) framework. Arvolution renders an\nagent's historical failed policy trajectories as semi-transparent ``ghosts''\nthat coexist spatially and temporally with the active agent, enabling an\nintuitive visualization of policy divergence. Arvolution uniquely integrates:\n(1) AR visualization of ghost policies, (2) a behavioural taxonomy of DRL\nmaladaptation, (3) a protocol for systematic human disruption to scientifically\nstudy failure, and (4) a dual-learning loop where both humans and agents learn\nfrom these visualized failures. We propose a paradigm shift, transforming DRL\nagent failures from opaque, costly errors into invaluable, actionable learning\nresources, laying the groundwork for a new research field: ``Failure\nVisualization Learning.''",

The survey also\nidentifies underexplored areas such as interpretability, cross-modal\nintegration, and sustainability. While significant advancements have been made\nin LLMs, challenges such as high computational costs, biases, and ethical risks\nremain.

However,\ncurrent multimodal reranking methods remain underexplored, with significant\nroom for improvement in both training strategies and overall effectiveness.\nMoreover, the lack of explicit reasoning makes it difficult to analyze and\noptimize these methods further. In this paper, We propose MM-R5, a MultiModal\nReasoning-Enhanced ReRanker via Reinforcement Learning for Document Retrieval,\naiming to provide a more effective and reliable solution for multimodal\nreranking tasks. MM-R5 is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nand reinforcement learning (RL).

To support this, we introduce a novel data\nconstruction strategy that produces rich, high-quality reasoning data. In the\nRL stage, we design a task-specific reward framework, including a reranking\nreward tailored for multimodal candidates and a composite template-based reward\nto further refine reasoning quality. We conduct extensive experiments on\nMMDocIR, a challenging public benchmark spanning multiple domains.

Algorithmically, it iteratively updates both the\nprecision matrix and the relationship between $Y$ and the refined inputs. To\nmitigate the computational inefficiencies of the $\\mathcal O(m^3 + d^3)$ cost\nper iteration, we introduce Sequential NARD, which evaluates features\nsequentially, and a Surrogate Function Method, leveraging an efficient\napproximation of the marginal likelihood and simplifying the calculation of\ndeterminant and inverse of an intermediate matrix. Combining the Sequential\nupdate with the Surrogate Function method further reduces computational costs.\nThe computational complexity per iteration for these three methods is reduced\nto $\\mathcal O(m^3+p^3)$, $\\mathcal O(m^3 + d^2)$, $\\mathcal O(m^3+p^2)$,\nrespectively, where $p \\ll d$ is the final number of features in the model.

    "abstract": "Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to enable AI models to continuously\nlearn from sequentially arriving data of different classes over time while\nretaining previously acquired knowledge. Recently, Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, like prompt pool-based approaches and adapter\ntuning, have shown great attraction in CIL. However, these methods either\nintroduce additional parameters that increase memory usage, or rely on rigid\nregularization techniques which reduce forgetting but compromise model\nflexibility. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Elastic Knowledge\nPreservation and Compensation (EKPC) method, integrating Importance-aware\nParameter Regularization (IPR) and Trainable Semantic Drift Compensation (TSDC)\nfor CIL. Specifically, the IPR method assesses the sensitivity of network\nparameters to prior tasks using a novel parameter-importance algorithm. It then\nselectively constrains updates within the shared adapter according to these\nimportance values, thereby preserving previously acquired knowledge while\nmaintaining the model's flexibility. However, it still exhibits slight semantic\ndifferences in previous knowledge to accommodate new incremental tasks, leading\nto decision boundaries confusion in classifier. To eliminate this confusion,\nTSDC trains a unified classifier by compensating prototypes with trainable\nsemantic drift. Extensive experiments on five CIL benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method, showing superior performances to existing\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

This raises a foundational question: why does RLHF\nperform so well in practice if it fails these seemingly essential properties?\nIn this paper, we resolve this paradox by showing that under mild and\nempirically plausible assumptions on the preference profile, RLHF does satisfy\npairwise majority and Condorcet consistency. These assumptions are frequently\nsatisfied in real-world alignment tasks, offering a theoretical explanation for\nRLHF's strong practical performance. Furthermore, we show that a slight\nmodification to the reward modeling objective can ensure pairwise majority or\nCondorcet consistency even under general preference profiles, thereby improving\nthe alignment process. Finally, we go beyond classical axioms in economic and\nsocial choice theory and introduce new alignment criteria -- preference\nmatching, preference equivalence, and group preference matching -- that better\nreflect the goal of learning distributions over responses. We show that while\nRLHF satisfies the first two properties, it fails to satisfy the third. We\nconclude by discussing how future alignment methods may be designed to satisfy\nall three.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the effects of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption\nin organizations. We ask: (1) How should a principal optimally deploy limited\nAI resources to replace workers in a team? (2) In a sequential workflow, which\nworkers face the highest risk of AI replacement? (3) How does substitution with\nAI affect both the replaced and non-replaced workers' wages? We develop a\nsequential team production model in which a principal can use peer monitoring\n-- where each worker observes the effort of their predecessor -- to discipline\nteam members. The principal may replace some workers with AI agents, whose\nactions are not subject to moral hazard. Our analysis yields four key results.\nFirst, the optimal AI strategy involves the stochastic use of AI to replace\nworkers. Second, the principal replaces workers at the beginning and at the end\nof the workflow, but does not replace the middle worker, since this worker is\ncrucial for sustaining the flow of information obtained by peer monitoring.\nThird, the principal may choose not to fully exhaust the AI capacity at her\ndiscretion. Fourth, the optimal AI adoption increases average wages and reduces\nintra-team wage inequality.",

    "abstract": "It has become mainstream to deploy Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models\non ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the help of the cloud to\nprovide users with a variety of high-quality services. Most existing methods\nhave two limitations: (i) low robustness in handling corrupted image data\ncollected by IoT devices; and (ii) high consumption of computational and\ntransmission resources. To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear\ntransformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature\nmaps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to\nimprove the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution\nfilters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small\nset of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on\nvanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several\ngroups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse\nfeature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively\nreduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training\nby setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not\nupdating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by\nusing NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated\nbased on sliding windows. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, CIFAR-10-C,\nIcons50, and ImageNet-1K datasets in NVIDIA RTX GPU platforms show that the\nproposed GroupNL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in model robust and\ntraining acceleration. Specifically, on the Icons-50 dataset, the accuracy of\nGroupNL-ResNet-18 achieves approximately 2.86% higher than the vanilla\nResNet-18. GroupNL improves training speed by about 53% compared to vanilla CNN\nwhen trained on a cluster of 8 NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs on the ImageNet-1K dataset.",

    "abstract": "Memorization in large language models poses critical risks for privacy and\nfairness as these systems scale to billions of parameters. While previous\nstudies established correlations between memorization and factors like token\nfrequency and repetition patterns, we revealed distinct response patterns:\nfrequency increases minimally impact memorized samples (e.g. 0.09) while\nsubstantially affecting non-memorized samples (e.g., 0.25), with consistency\nobserved across model scales. Through counterfactual analysis by perturbing\nsample prefixes and quantifying perturbation strength through token positional\nchanges, we demonstrate that redundancy correlates with memorization patterns.\nOur findings establish that: about 79% of memorized samples are low-redundancy,\nthese low-redundancy samples exhibit 2-fold higher vulnerability than\nhigh-redundancy ones, and consequently memorized samples drop by 0.6 under\nperturbation while non-memorized samples drop by only 0.01, indicating that\nmore redundant content becomes both more memorable and more fragile. These\nfindings suggest potential redundancy-guided approaches for data preprocessing,\nthereby reducing privacy risks and mitigating bias to ensure fairness in model\ndeployments.",

To address this knowledge gap, we present the\nfirst comprehensive empirical investigation into bug characteristics and\ntesting practices in modern LLM libraries. We examine 313 bug-fixing commits\nextracted across two widely-adopted LLM libraries: HuggingFace Transformers and\nvLLM.Through rigorous manual analysis, we establish comprehensive taxonomies\ncategorizing bug symptoms into 5 types and root causes into 14 distinct\ncategories.Our primary discovery shows that API misuse has emerged as the\npredominant root cause (32.17%-48.19%), representing a notable transition from\nalgorithm-focused defects in conventional deep learning frameworks toward\ninterface-oriented problems. Additionally, we examine 7,748 test functions to\nidentify 7 distinct test oracle categories employed in current testing\napproaches, with predefined expected outputs (such as specific tensors and text\nstrings) being the most common strategy. Our assessment of existing testing\neffectiveness demonstrates that the majority of bugs escape detection due to\ninadequate test cases (41.73%), lack of test drivers (32.37%), and weak test\noracles (25.90%). Drawing from these findings, we offer some recommendations\nfor enhancing LLM library quality assurance.",

In this study, we present a novel structural framework for\nresearch ideation.

The\nsystem ingests papers from nine major AI conferences, which collectively span\nthe vast subfields of machine learning, and organizes them into a hierarchical\ntopic tree. It uses the tree to identify distant topic pairs, generate novel\nresearch abstracts, and refine them through iterative self-evaluation against\nrelevant literature and peer reviews, generating and refining abstracts that\nare both grounded in real-world research and demonstrably interesting.\nExperiments using LLM-based metrics indicate that our method significantly\nimproves the concreteness of generated research ideas relative to standard\nprompting approaches.

To\naddress these problems, this paper introduces a novel knee joint design\nparadigm employing a dynamically decreasing reduction ratio for explosive\noutput during jump. Analysis of motor output characteristics and knee\nkinematics during jumping inspired a coupling strategy in which the reduction\nratio gradually decreases as the joint extends. A high initial ratio rapidly\nincreases torque at jump initiation, while its gradual reduction minimizes\nmotor speed increments and power losses, thereby maintaining sustained\nhigh-power output. A compact and efficient linear actuator-driven guide-rod\nmechanism realizes this coupling strategy, supported by parameter optimization\nguided by explosive jump control strategies. Experimental validation\ndemonstrated a 63 cm vertical jump on a single-joint platform (a theoretical\nimprovement of 28.1\\% over the optimal fixed-ratio joints). Integrated into a\nhumanoid robot, the proposed design enabled a 1.1 m long jump, a 0.5 m vertical\njump, and a 0.5 m box jump.",

Motivated by recent observations from the East Asian VLBI\nNetwork (EAVN) showing periodic behavior in the M87 jet, a precession of about\n11 years and a transverse oscillation of about 0.9 years, we constrain the mass\nof a hypothetical secondary black hole orbiting the primary SMBH in M87. To\nconstrain the mass ratio between the primary SMBH ($M_{1}$) and the secondary\nblack hole ($M_{2}$) defined as $q \\equiv M_{2}/M_{1} \\leq 1$, and the length\nof the semimajor axis of the binary system ($a$), we impose the following three\nconstraints: (i) the lower limit of $a$, below which the SMBH binary is\nexpected to merge. (ii) the strain amplitude of the gravitational wave\nbackground (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies shown in the NANOGrav 15-year\ndataset. (iii) a finite length of the semimajor axis of $M_{1}$, that can\ninduce periodic behavior in the jet. By combining these constraints, we obtain\nthe allowed parameter space for $q$ and $a$.

In our previous\npaper, we developed a theory for $m$-Cayley isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley\ndigraphs, and classified finite $m$CI-groups for each $m\\geq 2$, and finite\n$m$PCI-groups for each $m\\geq 4$. The next natural step is to classify finite\n$m$PCI-groups for $m=2$ or $3$. Note that BCI-groups form an important subclass\nof the $2$PCI-groups, which were introduced in 2008 by Xu et al. Despite much\neffort having been made on the study of BCI-groups, the problem of classifying\nfinite BCI-groups is still widely open.\n  In this paper, we prove that every finite $2$PCI-group is solvable, and its\nSylow $3$-subgroup is isomorphic to $Z_3, Z_3\\times Z_3$ or $Z_9$, and Sylow\n$p$-subgroup with $p\\not=3$ is either elementary abelian, or isomorphic to\n$Z_4$ or $Q_8$. We also introduce the kernel isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley\ndigraphs, and establish some useful theory for studying this kind of\nisomorphisms. Using the results of kernel isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs\ntogether with the results on $2$PCI-groups, we give a proper description of\nfinite BCI-groups, and in particular, we obtain a complete classification of\nfinite non-abelian BCI-groups.",

Since testing for hidden confounders cannot be accomplished only\nwith observational data, conditional unconfoundedness is commonly assumed in\nthe literature of CATE estimation. Nevertheless, under this assumption, CATE\nestimation can be significantly biased due to the effects of unobserved\nconfounders. In this work, we consider the case where in addition to a\npotentially large observational dataset, a small dataset from a randomized\ncontrolled trial (RCT) is available.

We evaluated Causal Forest based CATE\nestimation strategies that address trial selection bias. Specifically, we\ncompared approaches of fitting Causal Forest with covariates of interest only,\nadditionally including covariates that determine trial participation, and\nrepeating these models with inverse probability weighting (IPW) to reweight\ntrial samples to the source population. Identification theory suggests unbiased\nCATE estimation is possible when covariates related to trial participation are\nincluded. However, simulation studies demonstrated that, under realistic RCT\nsample sizes, variance inflation from high dimensional covariates often\noutweighed modest bias reduction. Including greater than 3 covariates related\nto participation substantially degraded precision unless sample sizes were\nlarge. In contrast, IPW methods consistently improved performance across\nscenarios, even when the weighting model was misspecified. Application to the\nVITAL trial of omega 3 fatty acids and coronary heart disease further\nillustrated how IPW shifts estimates toward source population effects and\nrefines heterogeneity assessments. Our findings highlight a fundamental bias\nvariance tradeoff in generalizing CATE from RCTs. While inclusion of trial\nselection variables ensures consistency in theory, in practice it may worsen\nperformance in medical trials with sample size of 5000 or less.

    "abstract": "Partial synchronization plays a crucial role in the functioning of neuronal\nnetworks: selective, coordinated activation of neurons enables information\nprocessing that flexibly adapts to a changing computational context. Since the\nstructure of coherent activity patterns reflects the network's current state,\ndeveloping automated tools to identify them is a key challenge in\nneurodynamics. Existing methods for analyzing neuronal dynamics tend to focus\non global characteristics of the network, such as its aggregated synchrony\nlevel. While this approach can distinguish between the network's main dynamical\nstates, it cannot reveal the localization or properties of distinct coherent\npatterns.\n  In this work, we propose a new perspective on neural dynamics analysis that\nenables the study of network coherence at the single-neuron scale. We interpret\nthe network as a metric space of neurons and represent its instantaneous state\nas an activity function on that space. We identify specific coherent activity\nclusters as regions where the activity function exhibits spatial continuity.\nEach cluster's activity is further characterized using the analytical\nproperties of the activity function within that region. This approach yields a\nconcise yet detailed algorithmic profile of the network's activity patterns.",

Social confidence significantly improved in virtual spaces compared to\nreal-world interactions (p<0.001), particularly among participants with\ninitially low confidence, averaging an increase of 2.08 points.

The goal is to produce a near-optimal fair clustering\non $n$ input points with a minimum number of strong oracle queries. This models\nthe increasingly common trade-off between accurate but expensive similarity\nmeasures (e.g., large-scale embeddings) and cheaper but inaccurate\nalternatives. The study of fair clustering in the model is motivated by the\nimportant quest of achieving fairness with the presence of inaccurate\ninformation. We achieve the first $(1+\\varepsilon)$-coresets for fair\n$k$-median clustering using $\\text{poly}\\left(\\frac{k}{\\varepsilon}\\cdot\\log\nn\\right)$ queries to the strong oracle. Furthermore, our results imply coresets\nfor the standard setting (without fairness constraints), and we could in fact\nobtain $(1+\\varepsilon)$-coresets for $(k,z)$-clustering for general $z=O(1)$\nwith a similar number of strong oracle queries. In contrast, previous results\nachieved a constant-factor $(>10)$ approximation for the standard\n$k$-clustering problems, and no previous work considered the fair $k$-median\nclustering problem.",

Recent LLMs show impressive performance\non SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding\ntasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true\ncapabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving\nability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic\ntasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone and ground truth\nfunction reproduction with only the current file context and issue description\nto probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that\nperformance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization\nrather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models\nachieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue\ndescriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is\nmerely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing\nto possible data contamination or memorization.

The existing literature\ntypically focuses on the existence of equilibrium by using the PDE approach,\nwhich requires certain Markovian structure and the equilibrium is in the bridge\nform. We shall provide a new approach which is used widely for stochastic\ncontrols and stochastic differential games. We characterize all equilibria\nthrough a coupled system of forward backward SDEs, where the forward one is the\nconditional law of the inside information and the backward one is the insider's\noptimal value. In particular, when the time duration is small, we show that the\nFBSDE is wellposed and thus the game has a unique equilibrium. This is the\nfirst uniqueness result in the literature, without restricting the equilibria\nto certain special structure. Moreover, this unique equilibrium may not be\nMarkovian, indicating that the PDE approach cannot work in this case. We next\nstudy the set value of the game, which roughly speaking is the set of insider's\nvalues over all equilibria and thus is by nature unique. We show that, although\nthe bridge type of equilibria in the literature does not satisfy the required\nintegrability for our equilibria, its truncation serves as a desired\napproximate equilibrium and its value belongs to our set value.
